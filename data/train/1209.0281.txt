    "projectile fragmentation is an important technique for studying the reaction mechanisms in heavy ion collisions at intermediate and high energies . in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "if the beam energy is high enough , the participant - spectator scenario can be envisaged .",
    "the participant zone is highly excited whereas the projectile like fragment ( plf ) with rapidity close to that of the projectile rapidity and the target like fragment ( tlf ) with rapidity near zero are mildly excited .",
    "the plf has been studied experimentally , this being one of the tools for production and identification of exotic nuclei .",
    "a projectile fragmentation model is developed @xcite which involves concepts of heavy ion reaction plus the well known statistical model of multifragmentation ( canonical thermodynamical model ) and evaporation .",
    "this model is computationally much less intensive than heavy ion phase - space exploration ( hipse ) model @xcite and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite which are based on transport calculation and less phenomenological than epax @xcite which is based on the empirical parametrization of fragmentation cross sections .",
    "an impact parameter dependent temperature profile has been developed in order to better account for the results at different @xmath0 ranges and also to confront with data from different projectile fragmentation reactions at different energies .",
    "the model is in general applicable and implementable above 100 mev / nucleon .",
    "+ the organization of the article is as follows . in sec.2",
    "we describe the theoretical formulation of the model where as the impact parameter dependence of temperature is explained in sec.3 .",
    "sec.4 contains the results obtained from theoretical calculation and comparison with experimental data of different projectile fragmentation reactions with different projectile - target combinations and varying projectile energies .",
    "finally summary and conclusions are presented in sec.5 .",
    "the model for projectile fragmentation reaction consists of three stages : ( i ) abrasion , ( ii ) multifragmentation and ( iii ) evaporation . in heavy ion collision ,",
    "if the beam energy is high enough , then in the abrasion stage at a particular impact parameter three different regions are formed : ( i ) projectile spectator or projectile like fragment ( plf ) moving in the lab with roughly the velocity of the beam , ( ii ) participant which suffer direct violent collisions and ( iii ) target spectator or target like fragment ( tlf ) which have low velocities in the lab .",
    "here we are interested in the fragmentation of the plf .",
    "the number of neutrons and protons in the projectile spectator at different impact parameters are determined from abrasion stage",
    ". then the break up of each abraded projectile spectator is separately calculated by using canonical thermodynamical model ( ctm ) @xcite . finally , the decay of excited fragments are calculated by evaporation model @xcite based on weisskopf s formalism .",
    "we describe the details of the three different stages below .      in abrasion stage",
    "we assume the beam energy is high enough so that using straight - line geometry , plf , tlf and participant can be classified .",
    "we then calculate the volume of the projectile that goes into the participant region ( eqs . a.4.4 and a.4.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "what remains in the plf is @xmath1 .",
    "this is a function of @xmath2 , the impact parameter .",
    "if the original volume of the projectile is @xmath3 , the original number of neutrons is @xmath4 and the original number of protons is @xmath5 then the average number of neutrons in the plf is @xmath6 and the average number of protons is @xmath7 .",
    "these will usually be non - integers . since in any event",
    "only integral numbers for neutrons and protons can materialise in the plf , we have to guess what is the distribution of @xmath8 which produces these average values . for this purpose minimal distribution model",
    "let @xmath9 where @xmath10 is less than 1 .",
    "we can also define @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 is zero unless @xmath13 is @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the distribution is narrow .",
    "we then get @xmath16 and @xmath17 . from @xmath18",
    "we can similarly define @xmath19 .",
    "together now we write @xmath20 .",
    "the abrasion cross - section when there are @xmath21 neutrons and @xmath22 protons in the plf is labelled by @xmath23 : @xmath24 where the suffix @xmath25 denotes abrasion .",
    "the limits of integration in eq.(1 ) are @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for @xmath26",
    "we have either 0 ( if the projectile is larger than the target ) or @xmath28 ( if the target is larger than the projectile , in this case at lower value of @xmath2 there is no plf left ) .",
    "actually there is an extra parameter that needs to be specified .",
    "the complete labeling is @xmath29 if we assume that irrespective of the value of @xmath2 , the plf has a temperature @xmath30 .",
    "here we have broadened this to the more general case where the temperature is dependent on the impact parameter @xmath2 . in evaluating eq.(1 )",
    "we replace integration by a sum .",
    "we divide the interval @xmath26 to @xmath31 into small segments of length @xmath32 .",
    "let the mid - point of the @xmath33-th bin be @xmath34 and the temperature for collision at @xmath34 be @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 where @xmath37 plf s with the same @xmath8 but different @xmath35 s are treated independently for further calculations .      the abraded system of @xmath21 neutrons and",
    "@xmath22 protons created at impact parameter b will have an excitation which we characterize by a temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the impact parameter dependence of the temperature profile is obtained from different projectile fragmentation reactions with different projectile target combinations .",
    "the details of it is described in the next section .",
    "the abraded system with @xmath8 and a temperature @xmath30 will break up into many composites and nucleons .",
    "we use the canonical thermodynamic model ( ctm ) @xcite to calculate this break up .",
    "assume that the system with @xmath21 neutrons and @xmath22 protons at temperature @xmath30 , has expanded to a higher than normal volume and the partitioning into different composites can be calculated according to the rules of equilibrium statistical mechanics . in a canonical model , the partitioning",
    "is done such that all partitions have the correct @xmath38 .",
    "the canonical partition function is given by @xmath39 here the sum is over all possible channels of break - up ( the number of such channels is enormous ) which satisfy @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; @xmath42 is the partition function of one composite with neutron number @xmath43 and proton number @xmath44 respectively and @xmath45 is the number of this composite in the given channel .",
    "the one - body partition function @xmath42 is a product of two parts : one arising from the translational motion of the composite and another from the intrinsic partition function of the composite : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the mass number of the composite and @xmath1 is the volume available for translational motion ; @xmath1 will be less than @xmath48 , the volume to which the system has expanded at break up ( freeze - out volume ) .",
    "we use @xmath49 , where @xmath3 is the normal volume of nucleus with @xmath22 protons and @xmath21 neutrons . in the projectile fragmentation model",
    "we have used a fairly typical value @xmath50 .",
    "the probability of a given channel @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 the average number of composites with @xmath43 neutrons and @xmath44 protons is seen easily from the above equation to be @xmath53 there are two constraints : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "substituting eq.(7 ) in these two constraint conditions , two recursion relations @xcite can be obtained .",
    "any one recursion relation can be used for calculating @xmath54 .",
    "for example @xmath55    we list now the properties of the composites used in this work .",
    "the proton and the neutron are fundamental building blocks thus @xmath56 where 2 takes care of the spin degeneracy . for deuteron ,",
    "triton , @xmath57he and @xmath58he we use @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ground state energy of the composite and @xmath61 is the experimental spin degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "excited states for these very low mass nuclei are not included .",
    "for mass number @xmath62 and greater we use the liquid - drop formula . for nuclei in isolation , this reads ( @xmath47 ) @xmath63\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression includes the volume energy [ @xmath64 mev ] , the temperature dependent surface energy [ @xmath65 with @xmath66 mev and @xmath67 mev ] , the coulomb energy with wigner - seitz approximation @xcite [ @xmath68 with @xmath69 mev ] and the symmetry energy ( @xmath70 mev ) .",
    "the term @xmath71 ( @xmath72 mev ) represents contribution from excited states since the composites are at a non - zero temperature .",
    "we also have to state which nuclei are included in computing @xmath54 ( eq.(8 ) ) . for @xmath73 ,",
    "( the neutron and the proton number ) we include a ridge along the line of stability .",
    "the liquid - drop formula above also gives neutron and proton drip lines and the results shown here include all nuclei within the boundaries .",
    "we repeat the entire break up calculation for each projectile spectator created after abrasion stage with different temperatures at different impact parameters .",
    "let , @xmath74 be the average number of fragment having @xmath43 neutron and @xmath44 proton created after the multifragmentation of a projectile spectator ( @xmath8 ) at temperature @xmath35 , then cross - section after multifragmentation stage can be expressed as @xmath75      the excited fragments produced after multifragmentation decay to their stable ground states .",
    "its can @xmath76-decay to shed its energy but may also decay by light particle emission to lower mass nuclei .",
    "we include emissions of @xmath77he and @xmath58he .",
    "particle decay widths are obtained using the weisskopf s evaporation theory @xcite .",
    "fission is also included as a de - excitation channel though for the nuclei of mass @xmath78 100 its role will be quite insignificant . according to weisskopf s conventional evaporation theory ,",
    "the partial decay width for emission of a light particle of type @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 for the emission of giant dipole @xmath76-quanta we take the formula given by lynn@xcite @xmath81    for the fission width we have used the simplified formula of bohr - wheeler given by @xmath82 details of the each term of the above three equations and implementation of the evaporation model can be found @xcite ; here we give the essentials necessary to follow the present work .",
    "once the emission widths ( @xmath83 s ) are known , it is required to establish the emission algorithm which decides whether a particle is being emitted from the compound nucleus .",
    "this is done @xcite by first calculating the ratio @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 or fission and then performing monte - carlo sampling from a uniformly distributed set of random numbers . in the case that a particle is emitted , the type of the emitted particle is next decided by a monte carlo selection with the weights @xmath88 ( partial widths ) .",
    "the energy of the emitted particle is then obtained by another monte carlo sampling of its energy spectrum .",
    "the energy , mass and charge of the nucleus is adjusted after each emission and the entire procedure is repeated until the resulting products are unable to undergo further decay .",
    "this procedure is followed for each of the primary fragment produced at a fixed temperature and then repeated over a large ensemble and the observables are calculated from the ensemble averages .",
    "the number and type of particles emitted and the final decay product in each event is registered and are taken into account properly keeping in mind the overall charge and baryon number conservation .",
    "this is the third and final stage of the calculation .",
    "the same calculation is repeated for each set of fragments produced after multifragmentation at different temperatures .",
    "initially with the increase of the projectile beam energy , the temperature of the projectile spectator also increases . but above a certain energy of the projectile beam the temperature of the projectile spectator will not increase .",
    "this is known as limiting fragmentation .",
    "this projectile fragmentation model is valid in the limiting fragmentation region .",
    "the main reasons behind the excitation of projectile spectator are highly non - spherical shape and migration of some nucleons from participant to projectile spectator . without a calculation at a more fundamental level",
    "it is not possible to calculate the excitation . at this stage",
    "we do not deal with excitation energy as such and characterize the system by a temperature @xmath30 .",
    "we plan to work on this in future .",
    "though the temperature is independent of incident energy of the projectile , it depends upon the impact parameter .",
    "+ to get the impact parameter dependent temperature profile i.e. @xmath89 two types of parametrization comes to mind .",
    "the simplest case is that the temperature directly depends upon the impact parameter i.e. @xmath90 . in the another parametrization",
    "the temperature depends on the wound that the projectile suffers in the collision i.e. @xmath91 , so in this case @xmath92 . after calculating different observables of projectile fragmentation by using temperature profiles and comparing the theoretical results with experimental data",
    ", it is observed that linear parameterizations are enough i.e. @xmath93 , @xmath94 ... or @xmath95 , @xmath96 ... are negligible .",
    "since @xmath97 is physically more acceptable than @xmath98 , we finally choose this temperature profile .",
