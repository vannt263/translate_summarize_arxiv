    "@xcite    experimental detection of the chiral @xmath2-wave state in graphene would require achieving very high doping levels , while still avoiding excessive impurity scattering , which suppresses superconductivity .",
    "a complementary approach would be to engineer a system where the intrinsic @xmath6 superconducting pairing is enhanced .",
    "this would allow detection of the chiral @xmath2-wave state in graphene at lower doping levels and/or higher temperatures .",

    "theoretically , @xmath2-wave contact josephson junctions have been shown to significantly enhance the effect of the intrinsic @xmath7-wave pairing correlations.@xcite however , such systems face significant material interface problems and have not yet been realized .",
    "the fundamental problem in this case with conventional @xmath1-wave superconductors is the zero orbital angular momentum of the cooper pairs . by creating a superconducting vortex with @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the in - plane angular coordinate , we can",
    ", however , generate a center - of - mass angular momentum @xmath10 . in the vortex core",
    "this center - of - mass angular momentum can then be transferred into an orbital angular momentum.@xcite for the chiral @xmath7-wave states the orbital angular momentum is @xmath11 .",
    "thus , this process would require a doubly quantized @xmath12 vortex in an @xmath1-wave superconductor.@xcite    singly quantized superconducting vortices ( @xmath13 ) in neutral graphene have received a fair amount of attention due to the existence of two zero - energy core states,@xcite although the energy levels split when going beyond a continuum model description.@xcite the zero - energy core states have been argued to induce topological order in the vortex core.@xcite here we instead consider @xmath12 vortices in doped graphene , and there are then , in general , no zero - energy states.@xcite although multiquantum vortices are less stable than singly quantized versions , they have been observed in type - i superconducting thin films at high magnetic fields.@xcite they can also be formed in superconductors having columnar or larger defects acting as pinning centers.@xcite it should therefore hopefully be experimentally feasible to generate doubly quantized vortices in a conventional @xmath1-wave superconductor in proximity - contact with a graphene sheet .    in this article we establish the existence of chiral @xmath7-wave superconducting states inside a doubly quantized vortex in an @xmath1-wave superconducting graphene sheet .",
    "due to a strong proximity effect the @xmath7-wave states survive up to temperatures of the order of the transition temperature of the proximity - induced @xmath1-wave order , even if the intrinsic bulk @xmath7-wave transition temperature is only a very small fraction of that value .",
    "we establish the nature of this proximity effect as well as its functional temperature dependence .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate how the presence of the @xmath7-wave core alters the low - energy local density of states in the vortex , which should be detectable by local scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) .",
    "we use a nearest neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice to model the @xmath14-band structure of graphene : @xmath15 here @xmath16 creates an electron on the @xmath17th lattice site with spin @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude , and @xmath20 is the chemical potential . for simplicity we set @xmath21 and the lattice constant @xmath22 .",
    "we further assume a high doping level in the graphene sheet , due to the external superconductor , and set @xmath23 unless otherwise stated .    with the graphene sheet in close contact with a conventional spin - singlet @xmath1-wave superconductor",

    ", we can self - consistently calculate the proximity - induced pairing using the self - consistency condition @xmath38 .",
    "the self - consistent loop starts with guessing @xmath39 , diagonalizing @xmath27 for this @xmath40 , using the self - consistency condition to recalculate @xmath40 from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors , and then reiterating until the change in the order parameter @xmath40 between two subsequent steps is less than a predetermined convergence limit .",

    "while computational demands limit the lattice size , and thus force a relatively short superconducting coherence length with accompanied narrow vortex cores , we have checked that our main conclusions are largely independent of the strength of the proximity - induced superconducting state .",
    "in addition to the proximity - induced superconducting state , we also assume ( weak ) intrinsic superconducting pairing in graphene originating from repulsive electron - electron interactions .",
    "@xcite the high density of states near the van hove singularity efficiently screens long - range electron - electron interactions leaving only short - range repulsion , which has been shown to result in pairing that is well localized in real space .",
    "@xcite with results showing no difference in the superconducting state between pairing on nearest neighbors and next nearest neighbors , even in the presence of defects such as edges,@xcite we choose to model the intrinsic chiral @xmath2-wave pairing correlations as a simple spin - singlet nearest neighbor pairing:@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 labels the three inequivalent nearest neighbor bonds .",
    "we solve self - consistently also for the intrinsic order parameter using @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the parametrization of the strength of the intrinsic pairing .",
    "we do not assume any relationships between the three different components of @xmath47 in each unit cell and thus there are three different symmetry solutions .",
    "the favored bulk solution of @xmath48 with transition temperature @xmath4 is @xmath49 ; a twofold degenerate state with chiral @xmath50 symmetry in the brillouin zone.@xcite note that the appearance of chiral @xmath7-wave symmetry is dictated by the symmetry of the honeycomb lattice , where the sixfold lattice symmetry forces the two fourfold @xmath51- and @xmath52-wave solutions to become degenerate . the third bulk solution to @xmath48",
    "is @xmath53 ; an extended @xmath1-wave solution with equal order parameters on all three nearest neighbor bonds.@xcite in the bulk , this solution only appears subdominantly or at very strong pairing @xmath46 .",

    "is shown below .",
    "the bulk superconducting energy gap found for finite @xmath46 exceeds that of @xmath57 due to the strong coupling between the two @xmath1-wave states .",
    "thus , when comparing solutions with and without @xmath2-wave vortex core states , we can not just compare solutions with and without @xmath46 , we need to also adjust @xmath37 to @xmath58 for @xmath57 , in order to regain the same bulk superconducting energy gap for the two cases .",
    "we solve @xmath59 self - consistently for both @xmath40 and @xmath60 on a finite honeycomb lattice with an imposed @xmath61 vortex rotation for @xmath40 within the bogoliubov - de gennes framework @xcite as described above .",

    "[ fig : amps](a - b ) .",
    "the amplitude of the order parameter in the core region of an @xmath62 vortex decreases as @xmath63 , in contrast to the narrower , linear decrease found for @xmath64,@xcite and is evident in the parabolic shape of the @xmath1-wave vortex profile in fig .",

    "even though a finite @xmath49 solution exists in doped graphene at @xmath66 , the @xmath2-wave solution can only appear when the proximity - induced @xmath1-wave state is heavily suppressed . in the vortex core , both @xmath1-wave order parameters necessarily go to zero to avoid multivalueness , but instead we find finite @xmath2-wave order parameters in the core , as shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : amps](d - e ) , as predicted.@xcite for the @xmath67 solution the @xmath68 internal orbital angular momentum can fully absorb the @xmath69 center - of - mass angular momentum associated with the @xmath1-wave vortex phase winding .",
    "we can thus have a finite , zero - phase winding , @xmath67 solution in the center of the core .",
    "for the accompanied @xmath70 solution the two angular momenta instead add to a total phase winding of @xmath71 around the vortex core .",
    "the @xmath70 state is therefore zero in the center of the vortex , as seen in fig .",

    "the role of the two chiral @xmath7-wave states are naturally reversed .",
    "the spatial threefold symmetric structure of the @xmath7 states follow the nearest neighbor bond directions on which the order parameters are defined .",
    "the symmetry structure is akin to the fourfold pattern found for the chiral @xmath73 states in the core of a @xmath2-wave vortex in fourfold symmetric high - temperature cuprate superconductors , following a similar transfer of center - of - mass angular momentum to orbital angular momentum in the vortex core.@xcite      in fig .",
    "[ fig : amps ] the temperature was set to absolute zero .",
    "it is then expected that @xmath2-wave solutions appear in the vortex core,@xcite also since the transition temperature @xmath4 for intrinsic pairing is finite at finite doping .",
    "what we are interested in is if the proximity - induced @xmath1-wave order parameter can enhance the @xmath2-wave state .",
    "clearly , @xmath40 helps the @xmath53 state in the bulk .",
    "however , since these two states have the same orbital symmetry , they will be experimentally nearly indistinguishable , i.e.  it will be essentially impossible to tell if the bulk gap is due only to the proximity effect or if it is also enhanced by a ( weak ) intrinsic pair potential @xmath46 . for",
    "the @xmath2-wave states the situation is very different .",
    "the @xmath2-wave solutions both have a very different spatial extent , only being large in the vortex core , and they have very different physical properties due to their chiral nature .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave ] we show the temperature dependence of the maximum amplitude of the @xmath67  core state , with crosses marking the bulk @xmath74 and @xmath75 of @xmath41 for the two cases displayed .",
    "there is a remarkable enhancement of the @xmath67  ( and @xmath70 , not shown ) state far beyond its intrinsic transition temperature . despite the , per - design weak , intrinsic pairing",
    ", there exists a finite @xmath67  state in the vortex core up to temperatures comparable to the proximity - induced transition temperature .",
    "since the intrinsic pairing can be assumed to be weak in graphene , with a very low @xmath4 , the fact that a @xmath67  state is present even far above @xmath4 might be of crucial importance for experimental detection .",
    "the @xmath67  core state and its temperature dependence are due to the proximity effect in a circular hole region .",
    "starting from the ginzburg - landau free energy for a superconducting order parameter @xmath76 , and studying a normal metallic ( n ) circular hole region of radius @xmath77 inside a superconductor ( s ) , we find @xmath78 for the order parameter in the normal hole region , where @xmath79 is the decay length of @xmath76 in the normal region .",

    "also , based on the numerical results in fig .",

    "we thus find excellent agreement between the numerically established temperature dependence and a simple proximity - effect model .",

    "[ fig : dwave](b ) we plot the maximum of the @xmath67 ( and @xmath70 ) amplitude in the vortex core as a function of the amplitude of the extended @xmath1-wave state in the bulk far from the vortex .",
    "we find a direct , approximately linear , relationship between these two quantities , although the proportionality constant is dependent on the doping level .",
    "we thus conclude that the finite @xmath96 state in the vortex core is a result of a multiple - step proximity effect .",
    "first , the external @xmath1-wave superconductor induces a uniform @xmath1-wave state in the graphene .",
    "then this uniform @xmath1-wave state couples strongly to the intrinsic extended @xmath1-wave state @xmath53 . the strong coupling between these two states is shown by the lack of temperature dependence for @xmath53 , valid for essentially all temperatures below @xmath41 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave](c ) .",
    "finally , the extended @xmath1-wave state is transformed by the proximity effect into the @xmath97 state in the vortex core , with the vortex phase winding rotating into the orbital part of the cooper pairs .    the @xmath7 states are heavily enhanced due to the above - described multiple - step proximity process , creating finite @xmath7 core states far above the intrinsic @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : dwave](c ) shows the large difference in temperature dependence between the bulk @xmath7 states and both @xmath1-wave states , which by proximity effect determine the core @xmath98 states through eq .",
    "( [ eq : didtemp ] ) .",
    "large proximity effects have been observed and modeled before in so - called weak superconducting links for @xmath99,@xcite including graphene sns junctions with @xmath2-wave superconducting contacts .",
    "@xcite the present case is different in two regards .",
    "first , the circular geometry of the vortex creates an even more enhanced proximity effect . in a linear sn junction",
    "there is an exponential decay of the order parameter into the n region , whereas for a circular geometry , there is a power - law decay .",
    "second , the vortex is created in an @xmath1-wave superconductor , whereas the proximity - enhanced core state has a @xmath100-wave symmetry .",
    "the mismatch in orbital angular momentum of the cooper pairs is compensated by different phase windings around the vortex core .",
    "we have so far established the presence of chiral @xmath2-wave core states in a doubly quantized @xmath1-wave vortex in graphene , even far above the intrinsic transition temperature for the @xmath2-wave states .",
    "often a subdominant superconducting order parameter nucleating in the center of a vortex core gaps the low - energy vortex quasiparticles .",
    "it can thus , in principle , be detected through the lack of vortex core states , using e.g.  sts .",
    "the @xmath7 states are fully gapped superconductors in the bulk but they have gapless chiral edge modes.@xcite thus , while the @xmath7 states gap the original vortex quasiparticles , they reintroduce low - energy states in the vortex core through their edge states .",
    "we therefore do not expect any characteristic signals in the energy levels of the vortex core from a finite chiral @xmath2-wave core state .",
    "however , we numerically find a notable spatial difference between the original low - energy vortex core states and the @xmath7 edge states .",
    "for an @xmath62 @xmath1-wave vortex , the lowest - energy core state forms a ring structure with a finite radius @xmath101 , where @xmath77 is the vortex radius.@xcite a finite @xmath7 state will push this core state to higher energies , at the same time introducing low - energy chiral edge states . since the @xmath7 states reside firmly within the vortex core , we find that the edge states have a radius @xmath102 at @xmath66 . as @xmath103 increases ,",
    "the @xmath7 states become slowly weaker and the edge states start to hybridize with each other across the @xmath7 domain , resulting in higher energies . at some temperature",
    "the radius of the lowest energy state will therefore jump from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "the temperature behavior of the radius of the lowest energy state is displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : loweste](a - c ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the radius for @xmath57 ( @xmath105 ) , whereas solid lines show the radius for finite @xmath46 , where both systems have the same bulk energy gap .",
    "we clearly see a sharp jump in the radius for the finite @xmath46 system with increasing temperature , jumping from a radius defined by the @xmath7 edge states to that of the vortex core state .",
    "this drastic change in radii happens at a temperature roughly ten times the intrinsic @xmath4 , which makes for favorable experimental conditions . in figs .",
    "[ fig : loweste](d , e ) the @xmath67  order parameter for temperatures just before and after the radius jump is shown .",
    "there is a notable change in the order parameter profile , but the @xmath67  state still exists for the higher temperature , even though its edge state is clearly no longer the lowest energy state .",
    "the relatively small radii reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : loweste ] are a consequence of the strong superconducting state . for more realistic @xmath1-wave vortex cores ,",
    "both @xmath106 and @xmath102 will be larger .",
    "however , we still expect a sharp jump in the radius of the lowest energy state when the gapless @xmath7 edge states disappear from the low - energy spectrum as the temperature is increased .",
    "this spatial change in the low - energy local density of states thus produces favorable experimental conditions for discovery of the chiral @xmath2-wave superconducting state in doped graphene by sts .",
    "in summary we have shown that intrinsic chiral @xmath7-wave superconducting pairing in doped graphene can be significantly strengthened in the core region of a doubly quantized @xmath1-wave superconducting vortex . for an @xmath62 vortex",
    "we find a finite @xmath107 state in the center of the vortex core , where the center - of - mass angular momentum of the @xmath62 phase winding has been transferred into the orbital angular momentum of the cooper pairs of the @xmath97 state . the @xmath97 state is always accompanied by a @xmath108-wave state , which is located around the center and with a phase winding of @xmath71",
    ".    the appearance of @xmath7-wave pairing in the vortex core can be described by a multiple - step proximity effect . when graphene is put in close contact with an external uniform @xmath1-wave superconductor , a uniform @xmath1-wave state is proximity - induced into the graphene . a uniform @xmath1-wave state couples strongly to all other possible superconducting @xmath1-wave states .",
    "if there are finite @xmath2-wave pairing correlations in a material , there is also necessarily an extended @xmath1-wave state possibility , which does not break fourfold rotational symmetry but in general has some @xmath109-space dependence .",
    "even though the extended @xmath1-wave symmetry is subdominant to the @xmath2-wave symmetry in the bulk , it becomes favored in a graphene - superconductor hybrid structure .",
    "thus the external @xmath1-wave superconductor also induces extended @xmath1-wave pairing in doped graphene .",
    "even when the intrinsic transition temperature for the extended @xmath1-wave order is only a fraction of the transition temperature @xmath41 of the proximity - induced uniform @xmath1-wave order , it survives with essentially no temperature dependence up to temperatures of the order of @xmath41 . in the vortex core",
    "the externally induced @xmath1-wave order is suppressed and with it the extended @xmath1-wave order . instead , the center - of - mass angular momentum of the extended @xmath1-wave state is transferred into the orbital part of the cooper pairs , producing a finite @xmath97 state , with an accompanied @xmath70 state .",
    "the strong coupling between the different @xmath1-wave states and the circular geometry of the vortex core give very strong @xmath7 states in the core .",
    "we find that the amplitudes of the @xmath7 core states have a temperature dependence @xmath110^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath4 is the intrinsic chiral @xmath2-wave transition temperature .",
    "there are thus significant @xmath7 core amplitudes even for temperatures many times larger than @xmath4 .",
    "this means that even if the @xmath4 is too low to be measurable in the bulk at experimentally achievable doping levels , its enhancement inside vortices offers an encouraging alternative route for discovery .",
    "doubly quantized @xmath1-wave superconducting vortices in doped graphene therefore present a very promising avenue for an experimental discovery of chiral @xmath2-wave superconductivity in graphene .",
    "since a @xmath7 superconductor has gapless edge states , we find no clear signatures in the vortex energy level structure from the @xmath7 core states .",
    "however , we find that there is a notable difference in the spatial distribution of the lowest - energy vortex core state when a @xmath7 core is present .",
    "the lowest energy state in a doubly quantized vortex is centered around a finite radius of the order of the superconducting coherence length . in the presence of @xmath6 pairing this state",
    "is pushed up to higher energies , while instead an edge state of the chiral @xmath2-wave order becomes the lowest energy state .",
    "since the @xmath2-wave order lives firmly within the vortex core , the edge state has a smaller radius than the original vortex core state . at some elevated temperature ,",
    "up to ten times the intrinsic @xmath2-wave transition temperature , the chiral @xmath2-wave order becomes too weak to support a low - energy edge state and there is a sudden jump in the radial distribution of the lowest energy state , from the edge - state radius to that of the core - state radius . we therefore suggest to detect chiral @xmath2-wave superconductivity in doped graphene by studying the temperature dependence of the low - energy local density of states in a doubly quantized @xmath1-wave superconducting vortex core .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss the prospects of generating an @xmath1-wave @xmath62 vortex in graphene . in our system",
    "the @xmath62 vortex in graphene is proximity - induced from an external superconductor .",
    "thus , it is necessary to use an external @xmath1-wave superconductor which can support @xmath62 vortices .",
    "doubly quantized vortices have been observed in several different superconductors both at high magnetic fields in thin pb films,@xcite as well as in the presence of pinning centers.@xcite using a magnetic field for this purpose will necessarily also induce zeeman pair - breaking for any spin - singlet pairing , including the @xmath6 core state .",
    "however , the critical field in type - i pb used in ref .",
    "is only @xmath111  g , thus causing a zeeman coupling significantly smaller than 40  mk , and we therefore believe we can safely ignore this small effect in the above calculations .",
    "also , a @xmath6 core stabilizes the @xmath112 vortex as it adds superconducting pairing to the core .",
    "this latter effect has even been suggested to make @xmath113 vortices energetically favorable over @xmath64 vortices near the critical field and at low temperatures.@xcite if instead we use pinning centers in the external superconductor to generate @xmath62 vortices , the @xmath97 state might be suppressed at the pinning site due to disorder scattering .",
    "we note though that the pinning site and the graphene @xmath97 state are spatially separated , which might still make pinning centers a feasible route to generate a @xmath6 vortex core state in graphene ."
