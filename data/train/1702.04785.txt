    "the ongoing experimental progress in the ability to efficiently couple polarizable emitters to waveguide structures opens many exciting possibilities in quantum optics research @xcite .",
    "a central theme in this growing field is the possibility to design long - range and modified interactions between polarizable objects , mediated by the waveguide modes .",
    "such enhanced interactions should prove useful for entanglement generation @xcite and for the study of novel many - body phenomena and quantum nonlinear optics with long - range interactions @xcite .",

    "the unique feature of electromagnetic phenomena in transmission - line ( tl ) waveguides is that it can be described by electrodynamics in one - dimension ( 1d ) , or equivalently , by tl circuit theory .",
    "this is in contrast to electrodynamics in other types of waveguides , for which a 1d description of broadband and non - resonant phenomena , such as zero - point fluctuation forces , is not adequate .",
    "transmission - line circuits in the quantum regime are now routinely used in the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics , where squeezed vacuum generation and the dynamical casimir effect were recently observed @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to consider a general theoretical framework for the description of quantum fluctuation - induced potentials inside tl circuits .",
    "as explained below , we focus on the regime at which the 1d electrodynamic description is valid , and compare two equivalent approaches for such a theoretical framework .",
    "the first approach considered here is a straightforward adaptation of qed to tl circuits , consisting of canonical quantization of propagating voltage and current fields @xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations and associated phenomena then originate in those quantized fields , and are described by an effective 1d qed theory , combined with a 1d scattering formalism @xcite .    in an alternative approach",

    "quantum fluctuations in the form of noisy current sources , emerge from resistive elements within the circuit , in analogy to the lifshitz treatment of the casimir force between dispersive materials in free space @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of these noisy currents within standard circuit theory , then provides an elegant route towards the calculation of fluctuation potentials in circuits , by simply using the kirchhoff circuit laws . moreover , much like in the lifshitz treatment , the advantage of the fdt description over that using canonical quantization , is the possibility to treat dissipative systems .",

    "a transmission line ( tl ) is formed by at least two conductors ( fig .",
    "this guarantees the existence of the transverse - electromagnetic ( tem ) mode as the fundamental transverse mode of the tl @xcite .",
    "the tem mode function , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the propagation direction and @xmath2 is independent of frequency , along with its linear dispersion , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the wavenumber along @xmath1 and @xmath5 the speed of propagation , constitute 1d wave propagation at _ all _ frequencies .",
    "this unique 1d propagation is in contrast to the guided modes of dielectric waveguides ( such as optical fibers ) or hollow metallic waveguides , where @xmath2 is frequency dependent @xcite .",
    "all other guided modes supported by the tl possess a cutoff frequency which is higher than @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the separation between the conductors that form the tl ( fig . 1a ) .",

    "the tem mode is valid for @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the distance between the interacting objects @xcite . in principle , the tem mode possesses two orthogonal field polarizations , however , due to the anisotropy of circuit elements ( e.g. parallel - plate capacitors ) , we consider only a single polarization , resulting in the usual scalar tl description .          considering only the tem mode ,",
    "the electromagnetic field can be described by propagating voltage and current waves in 1d , obeying the so - called telegraphers equations @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the voltage and current waves at time @xmath14 and position @xmath1 along the tl . for a given section of the tl with capacitance and inductance per unit length , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , that are independent of @xmath1",
    ", this leads to the 1d helmholtz equation in this section , @xmath17 for @xmath18 written in frequency domain .",
    "the resulting forward and backward propagating voltage waves @xmath19 can then be reflected by an impedance @xmath20 that terminates the line , with a reflection coefficient @xcite @xmath21 and where @xmath22 is the line impedance ( real number ) . in turn , the forward / backward current amplitudes are related to their respective voltage amplitudes by @xmath23 . when the impedance @xmath24 is placed in between two semi - infinite tl sections ( fig .",

    "( [ f ] ) .      according to the fdt , the dissipation of electromagnetic energy in a resistor ( ohmic losses ) must be accompanied by current fluctuations @xmath57 inside it . at open circuit , when the resistor is disconnected , the spectrum of these fluctuations is given by ( appendix d ) @xcite @xmath58 with a corresponding voltage spectrum of @xmath59 , and where @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the duration of the experiment , and @xmath62 is the inverse temperature .",

    "@xcite by similar considerations to those of the original casimir treatment , adopted to 1d field quantization with unlike boundary conditions .",
    "here however , a concrete physical system of impedances inside circuits is considered , which allows an interpretation in analogy to the result by boyer in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the free - space casimir force between a perfect magnetic conductor @xmath189 and a perfect electric conductor @xmath190 was found to be repulsive .",
    "therefore , the impedance @xmath185 can be viewed as that of a capacitor @xmath191 in the limit @xmath192 in analogy to @xmath190 , whereas @xmath186 can be seen as an inductor @xmath193 in the limit of infinite inductance analogous to @xmath189 .",
    "the former two examples can be made more realistic by considering circuit elements such as a capacitor @xmath122 and an inductor @xmath47 .",
    "the frequency dependencies of their respective impedances , @xmath194 and @xmath195 , exhibit opposite limiting behaviors at @xmath196 and @xmath197 , namely , when @xmath31 appears as open circuit @xmath32 appears as short circuit and vise versa .",
    "therefore , both behaviors found in examples 1 and 2 above should appear in this case . more explicitly ,",
    "consider their corresponding reflection coefficients in imaginary frequency @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the scaled frequencies associated with the capacitor and inductor , respectively .",
    "figure 5b displays the force between the components , which is calculated by numerically integrating eq .",
    "( [ fu ] ) as a function of the parameters @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "indeed , both of the results from examples 1 ( attractive force ) and 2 ( repulsive force ) emerge at the following limits : when the capacitance is small ( @xmath201 ) @xmath31 acts as open circuit and vise versa , whereas when the inductance is small ( @xmath202 ) @xmath32 acts as short circuit and vise versa .",
    "all previous examples included non - dissipative impedances .",
    "we shall now exploit the general formula , eq .",
    "( [ ffdt ] ) , derived using the fdt approach to consider a dissipative case that goes beyond that treated using the qed approach .",
    "specifically , we consider an impedance @xmath203 of a capacitor in series with a resistor . the corresponding reflection coefficient in imaginary frequency is given by @xmath204 which changes sign as a function of @xmath183 .",
    "figure 5c presents the resulting force for @xmath205 ( short circuit ) , plotted as a function of the parameters @xmath199 and @xmath206 .",
    "again , for small capacitance , where @xmath207 , the capacitor , and hence @xmath31 , behave as open circuit , so that the repulsion of example 2 is recovered .",
    "we have considered the fluctuation force between two neutral objects connected by wires .",
    "the objects are characterized by their impedances and , within the fdt approach , the fluctuations emerge from their dissipative part .",
    "this approach is simple to generalize for any dissipative circuit , and in particular to lossy tls , by modelling any resistance with a current source as in fig .",
    "moreover , it is also natural to apply to any general circuit configuration such as lumped circuits , since it does not rely on the quantization of electromagnetic waves , as in the qed approach . as such",
    ", it can become useful in the exploration of a variety of fluctuation phenomena in circuits , such as those studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , by merely solving a set of kirchhoff - law equations . in this respect",
    ", the study of fluctuation forces in circuits could provide a conceptually simple system wherein casimir physics can be explored in the absence of technical complications which may not add to its essence .",
    "we note that in principal , the general configuration beyond that of fig .",
    "1c can also be calculated within the qed scattering formalism .",
    "that would require to replace any resistive element @xmath63 by a semi - infinite tl with characteristic impedance @xmath63 and corresponding quantum field fluctuations .",
    "this would result in a more complicated scattering problem with multiple channels and inputs which is nevertheless fully equivalent to the more elegant circuit solution of the fdt formalism . in this respect ,",
    "let us also refer back to the fact that the result for the force in the qed approach , eq .",
    "( [ fqed ] ) , is identical to that found using the fdt approach , eq .",
    "( [ ffdt ] ) , even though the latter was derived for the general case whereas the former for the specific case of non - dissipative impedances embedded in a uniform tl .",
    "in fact , a similar situation exists also in 3d derivations of the casimir force between dielectric slabs or mirrors .",
    "there , the lifshitz treatment , which is performed for generally lossy dielectrics @xcite , formally leads to the same result obtained by derivations which assume lossless dielectrics and mirrors @xcite .",
    "although the main focus of this paper is on formalism , we shall conclude with a brief account on possible experimental realizations . a straightforward realization where the force between the circuit elements would in principle be observable",
    "is a systems wherein the motion of the center of mass of one of the elements is allowed and is measurable .",
    "a different approach would be to consider the interaction potential built between the two elements , which is associated with the force .",
    "then , if the energy spectrum describing the internal degrees of freedom of one of the elements is quantized , such as in a super - conducting qubit , the interaction potential could possibly be measured via the shift it induces on these energy levels @xcite . alternatively , in case one of the interacting elements possesses a movable internal coordinate , such as in a variable capacitor or inductor , the interaction potential may be inferred from the force induced on this coordinate @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank ulf leonhardt for valuable discussions and itay griniasty for careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "the financial support of the european research council ( erc ) , the israel science foundation ( nsf ) and the mit - harvard center for ultracold atoms is acknowledged .",
    "by energy conservation , it is clear that the relation between the power reflection and transmission coefficients of a non - dissipative 1d scatterer satisfies @xmath87 .",
    "similar energy conservation reasoning lead to the modification of this relation when the scatterer is situated at the boundary between media with different impedances .",
    "we will now show how these relations can be obtained using simple circuit analysis for the reflection of an impedance @xmath24 that _ terminates _ a tl , eq .",
