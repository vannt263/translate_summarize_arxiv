    "most of physicists believe that the existence of magnetic monopoles had been ruled out by experiments .",
    "however , experiments only indicated that the flux of magnetic monopoles on the earth is too low to be observed . in the primordial universe ,",
    "the electromagnetic interaction between magnetic monopoles and plasma is so strong such that magnetic monopoles might store up in the center of quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) during the collapsing process of the original giant nebulae , including at the collapsed core of the galactic center ( gc ) . due to the rubakov - callan ( rc ) effect@xcite",
    ", magnetic monopoles may catalyze nucleon decay and is invoked as the energy source of quasars and agn .",
    "the model of supermassive object with magnetic monopoles ( smomm ) @xcite , presented by one ( qp ) of the authors , gave five predictions , some of which match up with the recent astronomical observations quantitatively .",
    "it may be the signals for existence of magnetic monopoles in the supermassive objects .    from the symmetry and beauty of the dirac equation ,",
    "dirac @xcite suggested the existence of magnetic monopoles which is the most natural explanation of the quantization of electric charge .",
    "it is a fundamental problem in physics whether magnetic monopoles exist or not .",
    "the plan of this letter is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will sketch the model of smomm and its predictions . in sections",
    "@xmath0 , we will show some predictions of our model in agreement quantitatively or basically with some new astrophysical observations : a strong magnetic field around the gc , the observation of the rate of the emitted positrons , and the frequency of the spectrum peak of the thermal radiation from the gc . in the last section",
    ", we will discuss and try to explain two recent observations with the model of the stars with the magnetic monopoles : the highly super - luminous supernova asassn-15lh and the gravitational waves gw150914 .",
    "the model of smomm @xcite suggested that an amount of magnetic monopoles stored up in the center of quasars and agns , including at the collapsed core of the gc during the collapsing process of the original giant nebulae in the primordial universe because the electromagnetic interaction between magnetic monopoles and plasma was so strong . due to the rc effect @xcite , nucleon decay may be catalyzed by magnetic monopoles , @xmath1",
    "@xmath2    in this model , the rc effect is invoked as the energy source . in the case of gc",
    ", the smomm is located at the center with the radius of about @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is its schwarzschild radius ) .",
    "the total mass of the smomm is derived to be @xmath5 ( now taken as @xmath6 ) from the observed luminosity of sgr a@xmath7 ergs @xmath8 ) .",
    "the gravitational effect around smomm in the gc is similar to the model of supermassive black holes . in the black hole model , accretion of matter results in the huge luminosity , but the energy source in the model of smomm is supplied by the rc effect .",
    "the main predictions of the model of smomm are as follows @xcite .",
    "the production rate of positrons emitted from the smomm in the model is @xmath9 .",
    "high - energy gamma - ray radiation has energy higher than 0.5 mev",
    ". the integrated energy of these radiations would be much greater than both the bolometric luminosity and the energy of positron annihilation line .",
    "\\3 . the radial magnetic field at the surface of the smomm",
    "is estimated to be @xmath10 .",
    "the strong radial magnetic fields of the high - speed rotating smomm transforms a strong electric field for a distant observer in the rest frame .",
    "a variety of produced particles ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) would be accelerated by the strong electric field to very high energy , say @xmath14ev or greater .",
    "we predict that these could just be the observed ultra - high - energy cosmic rays which have an initial energy of several hundred mev produced from the smomm .",
    "the surface temperature of the smomm is derived to be about 121 k and the corresponding spectrum peak of the thermal radiation is at @xmath15 in the sub - mm wavelength regime .",
    "the recent observation @xcite in 2013 indicated that * there is a dynamically important magnetic field near the black hole*. in particular , at @xmath16 the lower limit of the outward radial magnetic field near the gc is @xmath17 \\left[\\displaystyle \\frac { n_{0}}{26 cm^{-3}}\\right]^{-1 } mg ,   \\label{3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the number density of electrons there , and rm denotes the measurement of the faraday rotation near the gc .",
    "the lower limit of the observed data is in agreement with the the prediction 3 in the model of smomm because the magnetic field strength decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the source and has @xmath19 at @xmath16 . up to now no other physical mechanism",
    "can produce this strong radial magnetic field .    as analyzed in @xcite ,",
    " jet magnetic field and accretion disk luminosity are tightly correlated over seven orders of magnitude for sample of 76 radio - loud active galaxies \" .",
    "they pointed out that the black hole models  may require significant changes \" , and ",
    "models of the galactic center accretion disk may also need to be revised , as a dynamically important magnetic field has been reported @xcite within a distance of @xmath20 from the central black hole . \"",
    "new observation @xcite reported that the measured 511 kev line flux located at the gc at a distance of @xmath21 converts into an annihilation rate of @xmath22 . ",
    "the observed flux is compatible with previous measurements @xcite that have been obtained using telescopes with small or moderate fields - of - view , yet it is on the low side when compared to osse measurements . \"",
    "@xcite those observations are in agreement with the the prediction 1 in the model of smomm quantitatively .",
    "a review paper @xcite pointed out that the radio flux density @xmath23 from the gc shows a flat - to - inverted spectrum .",
    "i.e. , it raised slowly with frequency of the power peaking around @xmath24 hz in the sub - mm band .",
    "the observed power peak is in agreement basically with the prediction 5 in the model of smomm .",
    "the agreement of the predictions of our model of the smomm with three new astrophysical observations quantitatively or basically issues the signals for existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "we are looking forward to seeing more astrophysical observation which will meet the predictions of our model .    at the beginning of this year",
    "two important astrophysical observations were reported : the highly super - luminous supernova asassn-15lh and the gravitational waves gw150914 .",
    "we believe that our model and its development can be suitable to meet the new observations .",
    "the recent observation @xcite reported the discovery of asassn-15lh ( sn 2015l ) , which was interpreted as the most luminous supernova to be found .  at redshift @xmath25 , asassn-15lh reached an absolute magnitude of @xmath26 and bolometric luminosity @xmath27 erg s@xmath28 , which is more than twice as luminous as any previously known supernova \" .  in the 4 months since first detection , asassn-15lh radiated @xmath29 ergs , challenging the magnetar model for its engine \" .    up to now , the supernova explosion mechanism has not been solved . in a model of a supermassive star with magnetic monopoles , the phenomena of asassn-15lh and the super - luminous supernova ( slsn )",
    "may be explained naturally .",
    "although a few magnetic monopoles may be stored in the core of stars during the process of star formation from a neutral hydrogen nebulae due to very weak interaction between magnetic monopoles and neutral hydrogens , the stars may capture some flight magnetic monopoles in the space @xcite .",
    "the flux of the flight magnetic monopoles is @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the number density of the magnetic monopoles , @xmath32 is the average velocity of the flight magnetic monopoles in space , @xmath33 is the number density of the baryons in the interstellar space , and @xmath34 denotes the newton saturation value of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the total number of the flight magnetic monopoles and @xmath37 is the total number of nucleons .",
    "@xmath38 is the value of @xmath39 in the interstellar space , and its upper limit is @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "after formation of stars the total number of the magnetic monopoles captured by the stars from space is estimated to be          where @xmath45 @xmath46 is the cross section of the rc effect @xcite , @xmath47 is the thermal velocity of the nucleons , and @xmath48 is the central number density of the baryons for the star .",
    "the temperature would reach @xmath49k in the collapsed core of the supernova , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "thus ,        as long as we assume that the initial mass of the progenitor of the slsn is greater than @xmath53 , then its radius before the supernova explosion was greater than @xmath54 , and the life of the super - massive star is only @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the luminosity produced from the nucleon decay catalyzed by the magnetic monopoles in the collapsed core of the supernova , where the density of the core is much greater than the nuclear density , will be greater than @xmath56 ergs .",
    "this luminosity is enough to make the slsn exploding , so that the slsn is explained naturally .",
    "on september 14 , 2015 two detectors of the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) simultaneously observed a transient gravitational - wave signal ( gw150914 ) @xcite .",
    "this is the first direct detection of gravitational waves which was commonly explained as the first observation of a binary black hole system mergering to form a single black hole . on december 26 , 2015 , a second gravitational - wave event , gw151226 , was observed by the twin detectors of ligo@xcite .    on february 16 , 2016",
    ", @xcite reported that the fermi gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) had revealed the presence of a weak transient source above 50 kev , 0.4 s after the gw event : `` this weak transient lasting 1 s does not appear connected with other previously known astrophysical , solar , terrestrial , or magnetospheric activity . its localization is ill - constrained but consistent with the direction of gw150914''@xcite .",
    "they also note that the electromagnetic signal from a stellar mass black hole binary merger is not expected if the gbm transient is associated with gw150914 . based on their measurement of the fluence seen by gmb",
    ", a luminosity of @xmath57 erg s@xmath28 is derived in hard x - ray emission between 1 kev and 10 mev .    in another paper @xcite lyutikov analyzed the physical requirements in some detail that the possible observation of the electromagnetic signal contemporaneous with gw150914 imposes on the circum - merger environment , and found that the required physical parameters at the source exceed by many orders of magnitude what is expected in realistic astrophysical scenarios .",
    "he concluded that fermi gmb signal contemporaneous with gw150914 is unrelated to the black hole merger .",
    "the merger of two black holes can produce the gw only , not the gamma - ray burst simultaneously .",
    "however , in our model of stars with magnetic monopoles , the merger of two supermassive neutron stars with the magnetic monopoles , ( they can not collapse to black holes through the rc effect ) , whose mass density reaches to @xmath58 at the center core , not only produces the gw , but also produces the gamma - ray burst whose luminosity may reach @xmath59 through the rc effect . after we have finished this paper ,",
    "@xcite reported on june 15 , 2016 that they had made observations of the event gw151226 and candidate lvt151012 with both the fermi gamma - ray burst monitor and the large area telescope ( lat ) .",
    "no electromagnetic counterparts were detected by either gbm or lat .",
    "we are looking forward to the future detections of the gw which may accompany with the gamma - ray burst .",
    "if yes , it will verify the existence of magnetic monopoles .",
