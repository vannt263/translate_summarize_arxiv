    "elemental abundance ratios in stars are not observed  they are derived from observations .",
    "the standard procedure is to use a model of the stellar photosphere , characterised by a few fundamental parameters , and then model the radiative transfer in the spectral line in question .",
    "one of the input parameters in this is the elemental abundance which can be adjusted until the synthetic spectrum ( or just an equivalent width ) fits the observations .",
    "a stellar photosphere is a complex and dramatic place , a borderline between the hot inferno that is the inside of the star and cold , dark space .",
    "many approximations have to be used when modelling the photosphere and the spectral line formation processes .",
    "typical abundance work uses one - dimensional lte model photosphere and lte modelling of the spectral lines .",
    "this inevitably causes errors .",
    "the question is how big these errors are .",
    "i will discuss nlte effects in the formation of libeb spectral lines that are used for abundance determinations .",
    "i will also give a brief discussion on the possible effects of photospheric inhomogeneity .",
    "note that these discussions will not necessarily be valid for other stars than those of solar type .",
    "the strength of a spectral line , from a given photosphere , is set by the line source function and the line opacity . consider the formal solution to the equation of radiative transfer for outgoing intensity along vertical rays :    @xmath0    the source function @xmath1 has contributions from the spectral line and from the continuum , and so has the opacity @xmath2 which sets the optical depth scale , @xmath3 .",
    "the line source function contains the ratio between the upper and the lower level involved in the line transition .",
    "the line opacity is proportional to the lower level population . in local thermodynamic equilibrium ",
    "these quantities are easily computed from the boltzmann and saha relations and are thus functions only of the local kinetic temperature , the electron pressure , and the elemental abundance .",
    "the line source function then equals the planck function .",
    "we know , however , that we can not expect lte to be valid in a stellar photosphere .",
    "if we relax that condition , we must compute level populations by solving the rate equations and thus take into account collisional and radiative transitions among all energy levels in all ionisation stages . that is , unless we have good reasons to simplify the problem by cutting away levels .",
    "the radiative rates depend on the radiation field in the atom s lines and continua and thus couple different parts of the photosphere with different parts of the atom and different parts of the spectrum .",
    "we thus have an extensive problem to solve , which we call a non - lte or nlte problem .",
    "the term nlte can mean anything that is not lte , but all nlte work discussed here has used the assumptions of statistical equilibrium , maxwellian particle distribution , and complete redistribution of photons in frequency and angle .",
    "a nlte effect is then an error introduced by the lte assumption or a deviation from detailed balance in the transition rates .",
    "happily there are now efficient codes to solve multi - level nlte problems for trace elements in stellar atmospheres .",
    "the big problem then becomes the availability of atomic data .",
    "the situation is improving , partly thanks to the opacity and the iron projects ( seaton et al .",
    "1994 , hummer et al .",
    "1993 ) , but all data that one would like to have is generally not readily available at the required precision , especially for heavier atoms .",
    "the solution of a nlte problem consists of a very big set of data describing the population numbers , the transition rates between the levels , and the radiative field at various frequencies and atmospheric depths .",
    "we have to devise ways to talk about departures from lte and to describe very complex situations in simple words .",
    "remember that what is behind these effects is just the ordinary excitation and ionisation processes and not any strange new physics .",
    "remember also that what interests us is the difference between the nlte and the lte results . a small shift in , for example , the ionisation balance can have large effects on weak lines from the minority species .",
    "for solar - type photospheres one can set up the following rules of thumb :    * towards the blue & ultraviolet : @xmath4 .",
    "for a line with a source function behaving more or less like in the two - level atom approximation ( @xmath5 ) , this leads to an increased line source function : _ optical pumping _ or _",
    "overexcitation_. levels with important continua in the blue may contribute to _ overionisation_. * towards the red : @xmath6 .",
    "this tends to lead to opposite effects as those describe for the blue & ultraviolet .",
    "* strong lines suffer photon losses which pushes the line source function down , in the red also for weaker lines .",
    "such effects in neutral species can lead to _ photon suction _ which forces the ionisation balance downwards compared the saha value .",
    "note that an increase in the source function means that the emerging intensity increases .",
    "so increasing the line source function of an absorption line will decrease the line strength .",
    "increasing the opacity by increasing the level population of the line s lower level will of course increase the line strength in a typical photosphere .",
    "the nlte effects on the spectra of li , be and b in solar - type stars are of interest not only for the sake of abundance applications .",
    "these light atoms allow more or less complete model atoms to be compiled , and they are ( almost always ) true trace elements .",
    "thus the complexity of the problem is decreased and in modelling these spectral lines we `` only '' have to worry about the elemental abundance , the photospheric structure ( decoupled from the nlte problem under study ) and the quality of the atomic data .",
    "sometimes the abundance is so low that the problem simplifies even more because the lines and continua are so weak .",
    "all this means that if we are ever to be able to do perfect nlte modelling of any spectral lines of solar - type stars without resorting to tuning free parameters in the atomic or the photospheric models , libeb lines are among the best candidates .",
    "the nlte formation of lii lines in cool stars ( @xmath7 ) was investigated by carlsson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in an extensive grid of photospheric models .",
    "pavlenko et al ( 1995 ) and pavlenko & magazz ( 1996 ) have investigated very cool stars .",
    "lithium is sometimes so abundant that the strong lii resonance lines show the typical effects of line - source - function depression by photon escape .",
    "this makes the line stronger than in lte so that an lte analysis will overestimate the abundance .",
    "also involved are overionisation effects and the counteracting photon - suction effect .",
    "the resulting abundance corrections display a complicated dependence on stellar parameters and lithium abundance as can be seen in the illustrations of carlsson et al .",
    "the subordinate lines show more moderate abundance corrections than the resonance doublet and the corrections are sometimes of the opposite sign .",
    "this is an argument for checking lithium abundances also with these lines , if possible .",
    "the interesting lines for beryllium studies of cool stars are the beii resonance lines at 313 nm .",
    "beryllium has not been subject to as much nlte work as lithium .",
    "garca lpez et al ( 1995 ) and kiselman & carlsson ( 1995 ) showed that overionisation ( similar in mechanism to that of bi described below ) and overexcitation more or less cancel the nlte effect on the beii 313 nm equivalent widths in solar - type stars .",
    "the line opacity increases from the overionisation but that is countered by the increase of the line source function by optical pumping .",
    "this means that while the line formation circumstances differ significantly from lte , the resulting equivalent width does not .",
    "the situation prevails over some range of stellar parameters because both effects are driven by approximately the same ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "one may therefore say that it is alright to assume lte in analysing the beii lines until we know more .",
    "but note again that the lines are _ not _ formed in lte !      i will discuss the nlte line formation of bi lines in some detail since the effects investigated by kiselman ( 1994 ) and kiselman & carlsson ( 1996 ) seem to be important for the boron abundances and their interpretation for metal - poor stars",
    ".    the resonance lines of the neutral boron atom are all in the ultraviolet as is the case for beryllium . but",
    "a fundamental difference to the beryllium case is of course that we are observing lines from the neutral ionisation stage .",
    "when the neutral boron abundance is low , as is mostly the case in metal - poor solar - type stars , the nlte processes affecting the line that has hitherto been most observed  the doublet at 250 nm  are :        pumping in the line itself that raises the line - source function and thus weakens the line .",
    "overionisation caused by the pumping in the ultraviolet resonance lines .",
    "( and to a lesser extent by @xmath8 in the photoionisation continua . )",
    "this also weakens the line .",
    "both these mechanisms tend to make the lines weaker than in lte and the lte assumption will thus lead to an overestimation of the line strength or an underestimation of derived boron abundances .",
    "this means that nlte corrections always are positive except for very boron - rich stars where photon - loss effects in the resonance lines become important .",
    "note that these results were calculated using osmarcs photospheric models from uppsala ( edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ) and the nlte corrections of kiselman & carlsson ( 1996 ) should only be applied to lte results from similar models .",
    "if you do otherwise you are not being consistent , but are in effect mixing different models .",
    "the end result may not be so bad in practice since e.g. the osmarcs and the kurucz ( 1993 ) models tend to give rather similar lte results in these studies ( garca lpez et al .",
    "1998 ) , but one should be aware that the introduction of this inconsistency is a potential source of worry  at least for purists .",
    "application of these results to boron observations has shown that the nlte effects are important for the interpretation of boron data of metal - poor stars ( e.g. edvardsson et al .",
    "1994 , garca lpez et al .",
    "1998 , duncan et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the corrections increase in magnitude with increasing effective temperature and decreasing metallicity and have the effect of decreasing the slope in plots of stellar boron abundance as function of metallicity .    most of the atomic data used in the modelling can probably be regarded as rather sound .",
    "but there could be surprises .",
    "collisional ionisation is something that definitely should be improved .",
    "background opacities should be looked more upon  this is highly relevant also for lte work .",
    "( for the sun mgi and fe dominates the background at 209  nm and mgi and h - bf at 249  nm . for very metal - poor solar type stars various processes involving hydrogen dominates the background at these wavelengths . )",
    "blending of the ultraviolet resonance lines with background lines has a definite impact on the departures from lte .",
    "now , when observations of the 209 nm doublet are coming , a better linelist for this region should be included .",
    "the 209 nm observations of rebull et al .",
    "( 1998 ) cause problems anyway since they imply different abundances than those from 250 nm  with or without nlte effects considered .",
    "more such input would be welcome !    these uncertainties notwithstanding it is clear that boron abundance determinations of metal - poor solar - type stars using bi lines and assuming lte will always be underestimates .",
    "can we trust the nlte results discussed above ? if we can , how come most authors use lte analyses ? why does anyone bother to publish nlte corrections to lte results ?",
    "why are nt you all running nlte codes ?",
    "i have tried to find the top ten reasons for doing lte abundance analysis , which are discussed below .",
    "they are followed by the corresponding list of reasons for doing nlte analysis .      1 .",
    "_ lte is a robust approximation that has served us surprisingly well .",
    "_ indeed it has . but",
    "beware of selection effects .",
    "cautious abundance analysts have learnt to avoid the most problematic lines and situations .",
    "there are good lte spectrum synthesis codes around .",
    "_ apparently nlte codes are still more cumbersome to use and demand lots of input data .",
    "it makes it easier to compare results with other authors .",
    "_ this is an argument to publish lte abundances for reference , but not to use them as final estimates .",
    "_ it is inconsistent to model only the lines under analysis in nlte .",
    "_ is consistency better than truth ?",
    "indeed we would want to model the whole spectrum in nlte using 3d nlte photospheric models . while we can not do everything it is not wrong to do the improvements we can",
    ". note that nlte effects on abundance determinations can go in both ways , therefore there are no systematic effects to be expected a priori when comparing different lines and continua modelled under different assumptions .",
    "_ atomic data for nlte work are unreliable or non - existing .",
    "_ this was certainly true a number of years ago .",
    "but the argument is getting less and less valid , especially for lighter atoms .",
    "_ nlte results are sensitive to unknown or unreliable ultraviolet opacities .",
    "_ yes , but so are lte results ! 7 .",
    "_ there are so many ways to make mistakes in nlte work : this makes results unreliable . _ the input data for a line in an lte spectral line synthesis consists of something like ten numbers ( depending on damping treatment ) .",
    "the boron model atom used by kiselman & carlsson ( 1996 ) consists of no less than 6000 numbers .",
    "the results are not sensitive to most of these numbers  but there is always a risk of a mistake or error .",
    "this means that all nlte results must be carefully checked and that all opportunities for checking against different lines must be taken .",
    "but is it better to choose an approach that _ may _ give erroneous results before one that we _ know _ is wrong ? 8 .",
    "_ nlte modelling is too complicated for me to undertake . _ perhaps , but it is possible to have someone compute nlte corrections .",
    "_ it was good enough for my phd supervisor , so it is good enough for me .",
    "i do nt understand what this nlte thing is about anyway .",
    "_      1 .    _ lte is wrong . _ and that is in fact all there is to it .",
    "lte is wrong . _",
    "lte is wrong .",
    "_ lte is wrong . _ 5 .",
    "_ lte is wrong . _",
    "_ lte is wrong .",
    "_ lte is wrong . _",
    "_ lte is wrong . _",
    "_ lte is wrong . _",
    "_ lte is wrong .",
    "_ has anyone missed it now ?",
    "photospheric radiation fields depart from planckian and the radiative rates are generally larger than collisional rates .",
    "so the atomic populations are set non - locally by the radiation field and saha - boltzmann equilibrium is unlikely .",
    "may _ be a very good approximation sometimes , but its validity must be checked with nlte modelling except for a few very special cases .      to me it is strange to discuss lte abundances and nlte abundances separately as if they were quantities of different physical significance .",
    "we are trying to estimate abundances from observed spectra using as realistic models of the photosphere and the line - formation processes as possible .",
    "the current status of nlte computations is the current status of understanding of the line formation .",
    "we know that lte is wrong in most cases .",
    "it is not a question of choosing one or the other !",
    "my recommendation is that you may still publish lte libeb abundances because they are useful when comparing data from different sources and because they serve to illustrate the size of nlte effects .",
    "but nlte analysis or nlte corrected abundances should be used whenever possible for the abundances you use for astrophysics .",
    "current model photosphere codes for cool stars ( typically produced with the codes of kurucz or the uppsala group ) have a rather advanced treatment of opacities taking thousands of wavelength points into consideration .",
    "but they are still one - dimensional and plane - parallel and assume local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "the solar photosphere is not plane - parallel and homogeneous like the models .",
    "it shows ( among other things ) granulation  a manifestation of the convection that is driven by the strong cooling at the surface .",
    "we know that other stars show similar surface structures . to what extent",
    "does this affect abundance analysis ? if we look at how spectral lines behave over the solar granulation pattern we notice that almost all ( reasonable strong ) lines grow stronger over the bright granules with their strong temperature gradients and weaker in the darker intergranular lanes ( holweger et al .",
    "1990 , kiselman 1994 ) .",
    "figure 1 exemplifies this for a number of spectral lines observed with the swedish vacuum solar telescope on la palma .",
    "each point in these plots corresponds to a single position in the solar granulation pattern at disk centre . the spatial resolution is better than 1  .",
    "this shows directly that the simple view that dark and bright regions in the solar photosphere are like 1d models with lower and higher effective temperatures is wrong .",
    "the observation does not tell us directly how big errors the use of 1d models will give , but it shows that line ratios , from which abundance ratios are deduced , do not vary wildly  an indication that the effect is not too dramatic .",
    "there have been some attempts to quantify errors of using standard 1d models by comparison with 3d or 2d simulations ( e.g. nordlund 1984 , bruls & rutten 1992 , atroshchenko & gadun 1994 , kiselman & nordlund 1995 , gadun & pavlenko 1997 ) .",
    "a problem is that the hydrodynamic models necessarily have a simplified treatment of the radiative transfer and so it is not evident if any differences are due to these simplifications or to actual 2d/3d - effects .",
    "impressive advances have been made lately in three - dimensional hydrodynamic modelling of the solar photosphere and one can definitely say that solar granulation is understood ( e.g. spruit 1997 , stein & nordlund 1998 ) .",
    "so far only the sun and a few similar stars have been modelled in this detail  expect progress on this soon .",
    "one can imagine various ways for 1d models to be inadequate as approximation of the real 3d structure .",
    "first the 1d temperature and pressure structure may be bad representations of the spatial and temporal mean of the 3d reality .",
    "this would then give errors also within the lte paradigm .",
    "then there could be 3d nlte effects such as the one proposed by kurucz ( 1995 ) for the lii resonance doublet formation in extreme halo stars , which would cause severe errors in standard 1d lte abundance analysis .",
    "the idea was that hot ultraviolet radiation from bright photospheric regions ( something similar to granules ) ionised the lithium in the cool regions from which the lii lines would otherwise have been strong .",
    "a problem with such a scenario is that the simple bifurcation of the stellar photosphere into hot and cool regions is probably much too simplified .",
    "then the nlte mechanisms are not so simple so that one can just take for granted that more ultraviolet radiation leads to significant overionisation . finally , detailed modelling is needed to find out how this works .",
    "uitenbroek ( 1998 ) and kiselman ( 1997 ) investigated the nlte lii line formation in 3d solar granulation simulation snapshots .",
    "note that these were models of the sun , not of metal - poor stars .",
    "the same type of model was used but different methods were used for the line computations , and the interpretation of the results is a little different in the two papers .",
    "but it is clear that the 3d nlte effects in this case are small .",
    "i must also point out that numerical experiments showed that the ultraviolet radiation in the ionisation edges is not what determines the ionisation balance .",
    "it is instead set by pumping in the bb - transitions and thus at longer wavelengths where the radiation contrast is lower than in the ultraviolet .",
    "this can be taken as an argument against the existence of very large such 3d overionisation effects also in other stars than the sun .",
    "martin asplund in copenhagen is currently working on 3d hydrodynamic simulations of halo star photospheres to investigate lines used for abundance analysis .",
    "he finds a significant decrease of the derived lithium abundance for these stars ( asplund 1998 , private communication ) but warns that nlte effects and other problems may be to blame for this .",
    "according to the solar simulations displayed in fig .",
    "2 , the lte prediction is that the line gets stronger over bright granules and that it shows a significant spread for a given continuum intensity .",
    "this is not seen in the solar observations of kiselman ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , the nlte prediction does not fit the observations perfectly either .",
    "the observed @xmath9 relation is flat while the nlte simulation predicts a slight slope .",
    "i hesitate , however , to draw any definite conclusions from this .",
    "the problem is that the line is very weak and systematic effects in the continuum placement could cause spurious slopes here .",
    "so i just end by proposing that spatially resolved solar observations can be valuable in testing nlte spectral - line modelling since we see the lines of an element with one single abundance from different kinds of photospheric structures .",
    "note that in the lii case , the nlte effect in integrated light is rather small compared to the difference in slope and spread in seen in fig .",
    "2 . perhaps it could be possible to fine - tune the atomic models using these kinds of solar observations and then use them on other stars where nlte effects might be greater .",
    "correct your lithium and boron abundances for nlte effects !      results from extensive , detailed , and realistic modelling of the impact of photospheric 3d structures on line formation for a variety of stars is soon coming .",
    "that will be interesting .",
    "these studies must , however , be investigated from the nlte line formation point of view .",
    "my guess is that effects of photospheric inhomogeneity will for abundance analysts be like the 1d nlte effects .",
    "that is , they will not often be very dramatic but almost always of significance as the demand on accuracy in abundance determinations grows .",
    "but for some lines and situations the effects will be large ",
    "these cases must be looked for ."
