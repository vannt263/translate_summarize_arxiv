    "anisotropic transport properties in the normal state are one of the most striking features of high - temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) @xcite . the metallic in - plane resistivity ( @xmath6 ) accompanied by the non - metallic out - of - plane resistivity ( @xmath7 ) enhances @xmath8 at low temperature ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , whereas @xmath8 is independent of @xmath9 for conventional metals .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath8 is often called ` confinement ' @xcite , and can be a key to the elucidation of the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "we have studied the anisotropic transport properties of slightly overdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath10o@xmath11 crystals @xcite . although their resistivities @xmath7 and @xmath6 are both metallic , the anisotropy is difficult to understand within the fermi liquid theory .",
    "the next question is that of whether @xmath8 is anomalous for a parent antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator , whose resistivities @xmath7 and @xmath6 are semiconducting . to our knowledge , very little investigation has been done on @xmath8 .",
    "_ @xcite have found that @xmath8 for la@xmath0cuo@xmath12 _ decreases _ with decreasing @xmath9 below 200  k , which is significantly incompatible with @xmath8 for htsc s . since it does not saturate near 200  k , a higher - temperature measurement is needed .    for studying @xmath8 over a wide temperature range , bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath13cu@xmath0o@xmath3 ( @xmath14 : rare - earth )",
    "is most suitable for the following reasons : ( i ) oxygens for @xmath4=0 are chemically stable up to 600  k in air where @xmath6 remains `` @xmath9-linear '' @xcite .",
    "( ii ) when @xmath4 reduces from 1 to 0 , the doping level varies from that of a parent af insulator to that of a ( slightly ) overdoped superconductor @xcite .",
    "( iii ) all of the cu sites are equivalent , and only the cuo@xmath0 plane is responsible for the electric conduction . here",
    "we report on measurements and analyses of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath1er@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 single crystals with @xmath4=0 , 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1.0 .",
    "we have found that @xmath8 for a parent af insulator ( @xmath4=1.0 ) is quite unique ; it increases with @xmath9 below 100 k , takes a broad maximum near 300 k , and decreases above room temperature .",
    "this obviously indicates that a parent af insulator exhibits a quite different conduction mechanism from conventional semiconductors .",
    ".characterization of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath1er@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 single crystals .",
    "note that the actual composition ratio is represented by setting cu = 2 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "single crystals of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath1er@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 were grown by a self - flux method @xcite .",
    "powders of bi@xmath0o@xmath10 , srco@xmath10 , cuo , caco@xmath10 , and er@xmath0o@xmath10 of 99.9  % purity were mixed , well ground in an al@xmath0o@xmath10 crucible , heated at 900@xmath15c [ 1020@xmath15c ] for 10  h , and slowly cooled down to 760@xmath15c [ 820@xmath15c ] by 2@xmath15c / h for @xmath4=0 [ @xmath160 ] . since the single crystals were very thin along the @xmath17 axis , the thickness was measured with a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .",
    "the actual compositions were measured through inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy .",
    "the x - ray diffraction pattern showed no trace of impurities , and the @xmath17-axis lattice parameter for @xmath4=0 was evaluated to be 30.85   , which agrees with the value in the literature @xcite .",
    "the measured compositions , sizes , and @xmath17-axis lattice parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "we should note that crystals grown by a flux method are produced with little stress , owing to the slow cooling rate near thermal equilibrium .",
    "in fact , we did not observe any serious cracks in the sem images of our samples . in order to examine the influence of inhomogeneity and disorder on the resistivity , we made measurements for more than 30 samples including ones grown from different batches .",
    "the measured resistivities were reproducible enough to warrant the discussion in this paper .",
    "the resistivity was measured with a @xmath18 current @xmath19 in a four - probe configuration along the in - plane direction ( @xmath20 ) , and in a ring configuration along the out - of - plane direction ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we used two measurement systems below and above room temperature . from 4.2 to 300 k , the samples were slowly ( 100 k / h ) cooled in a liquid - he cryostat , where @xmath9 was monitored through a cernox resistance thermometer . above 300 k ,",
    "the samples are slowly ( 50 - 100 k / h ) heated in air in a cylinder furnace with a pt resistance thermometer .",
    "figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) show @xmath6 and @xmath7 of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath1er@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 single crystals , respectively .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath6 and @xmath7 increase with @xmath4 , showing that the hole concentration is reduced by the er substitution . as is seen in the literature ,",
    "@xmath7 is four or five orders of magnitude lager than @xmath6 for all the samples . for superconducting samples ( @xmath4=0 and 0.1 ) , metallic @xmath6 and semiconducting @xmath7",
    "are observed above @xmath22 .",
    "reflecting the slightly overdoped nature of @xmath4=0 , @xmath22 ( @xmath2384  k ) for the @xmath4=0 sample is lower than @xmath22 ( @xmath2387  k ) for @xmath4=0.1 .",
    "these results attest to the quality of our crystals .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath4=1.0 are semiconducting , but they exhibit different @xmath9 dependences . above room temperature , where @xmath6 decreases gradually in comparison with @xmath7 , @xmath8 decreases with increasing @xmath9 . on the other hand , @xmath6 becomes insulating more rapidly than @xmath7 , as shown in the inset of figure 1 where the resistivities are normalized at 300 k. thus @xmath8 decreases with decreasing @xmath9 below 300 k. these results are not understandable on the basis of conventional theories . in the framework of a band picture ,",
    "anisotropy is mainly determined by effective masses , implying that the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath24 is independent of the direction . in the case of a hole doped in the af background ,",
    "the situations are nearly the same .",
    "in fact , a nearly @xmath9-independent @xmath8 has been observed for la@xmath0nio@xmath12 @xcite and bi@xmath25co@xmath0o@xmath26 ( @xmath27=ca , sr and ba ) @xcite .    the magnitude of @xmath8 for a parent af insulator is much more difficult to evaluate than that for a superconductor , in that it is an exponentially varying quantity divided by another exponentially varying quantity .",
    "since we are interested in the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath8 , we normalize @xmath8 at 450  k in figure 2 . as for the magnitude",
    ", we show @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the inset of figure 2 , in which each symbol corresponds to a different sample . from the inset",
    "one can see that the magnitude of @xmath8 at 450 k is nearly independent of @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly the normalization at 450 k will not adversely affect the discussion below .",
    "we would like to point out three features in figure 2 .",
    "first , @xmath8 changes smoothly with @xmath4 above room temperature ; it increases with decreasing @xmath9 , and the @xmath9 dependence is steeper for larger @xmath4 ( smaller hole concentration ) .",
    "if one looked at @xmath8 only above room temperature , one could not distinguish a parent af insulator from a superconductor .",
    "thus we may say that the holes are confined in a parent af insulator as well as in htsc . in this context",
    "the former is as unconventional as the latter .",
    "secondly , @xmath8 for @xmath4=1.0 and 0.5 decreases with decreasing @xmath9 below 100 k , which is consistent with @xmath8 of la@xmath0cuo@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the decrease of @xmath8 as @xmath280 could be understood from the three - dimensional ( 3d ) nature of the localization @xcite .",
    "thirdly , @xmath8 for @xmath4=1.0 and 0.5 takes a maximum at a certain temperature @xmath29 , which is very close to the nel temperature @xmath30 .",
    "( for @xmath4=0.5 , a tiny fraction of a superconducting phase causes a small drop of resistivity near 90 k , which obscures the position of @xmath29 . )",
    "the localized @xmath31 spins of er@xmath32 make it difficult to measure @xmath30 of cu@xmath33 for @xmath4=1.0 and 0.5 .",
    "instead , we will compare @xmath30 of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath1y@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 @xcite , and we plot @xmath22 , @xmath30 and @xmath29 in the electronic phase diagram of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath13cu@xmath0o@xmath3 in figure 3 .",
    "we estimated the hole concentration using an empirical relation to the thermopower @xcite , which we measured with the same samples for @xmath14=er ( not shown here ) , and used ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath14=y .",
    "@xmath29 is found to lie around the af boundary . since no structural transitions and no phase separations",
    "are reported for bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath13cu@xmath0o@xmath3 @xcite , it would be natural to relate @xmath29 to the af transition .",
    "the confinement behavior above @xmath30 favors some theories based on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin fluctuation , which exists in parent af insulators above @xmath30 @xcite and in htsc s above @xmath22 as well @xcite .",
    "we therefore propose that holes are confined in a cuo@xmath0 plane in the presence of the 2d spin fluctuation , _ which occurs irrespective of doping levels_. as the 3d af order grows below @xmath30 , the confinement becomes less effective .",
    "a recent numerical analysis of the bilayer @xmath34 model has also led to the assertion that @xmath7 is substantially modified in the presence of the 2d spin fluctuation @xcite .",
    "we further note that a similar case is seen for a layered ferromagnet la@xmath35sr@xmath36mn@xmath0o@xmath37 @xcite . for 100 k @xmath38 250",
    "k , this compound is in a 2d ferromagnetic state , and exhibits a non - metallic @xmath7 together with a metallic @xmath6 .",
    "once the 3d ferromagnetic order appears below 100 k , @xmath7 becomes metallic to behave in a 3d - like manner .",
    "we believe that the out - of - plane conduction in parent af insulators includes essentially the same physics as for la@xmath35sr@xmath36mn@xmath0o@xmath37 ; the only difference is as regards whether the material is an antiferromagnetic insulator or a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "we prepared bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath1er@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 , single crystals for @xmath4=0 , 0.1 , 0.5 and 1.0 and measured the in - plane and out - of - plane resistivities ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) from 4.2 to 500  k. the present study has revealed that @xmath8 for a parent antiferromagnetic insulator ( @xmath39 ) strongly depends on temperature , and that the enhancement of @xmath8 with decreasing @xmath9 is observed above room temperature . in this sense ,",
    "parent antiferromagnetic insulators are as unconventional as high - temperature superconductors .",
    "their ratios @xmath8 take maxima at a certain temperature near the nel temperature , and we propose that the confinement in the cuo@xmath0 plane is operative in the two - dimensional spin - fluctuation regime regardless of the doping level .",
    "the authors would like to thank t itoh , t kawata , k takahata and y iguchi for collaboration .",
    "they also wish to express their appreciation to s kurihara and s saito for fruitful discussions and valuable comments .",
