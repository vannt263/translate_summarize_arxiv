    "the two - photon transition form factors of the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 have received a great attention lately  both from the experimental and the theoretical side .",
    "the recent babar experiments  @xcite have provided us with important information in the high-@xmath3 region of the photon virtuality and have triggered new insight into the structure of mesons  @xcite .",
    "hopefully , results from belle experiment will soon be available , and will provide a very important cross - check of the babar data and boost a progress in the form factor phenomenology . a new experiment kloe-2 at frascati  @xcite",
    "will soon be able to provide us with the information on the pion two - photon form factor at low @xmath3  in a region where no measurements were available  @xcite .",
    "also the transition form factors of @xmath4 ( and other ) mesons will be measured in bes - iii  @xcite experiment at beijing with high statistics .",
    "the monte carlo generators based on reliable models are needed for data analysis and feasibility studies .",
    "one of the tools in this field is the monte carlo generator ekhara  @xcite , which is already in use by kloe-2 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "a realiable simulation has to account for both photon virtualities in the form factor even for a `` single - tag '' experiment .",
    "therefore , the formulae for the form factors as functions of two photon virtualities are needed .",
    "this criterion considerably reduces the choice for the form factor , because the majority of the published formulae within different theoretical approaches hold only for the case with one photon being real and the other  space - like and virtual .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the knowledge of the transition form factors is important in itself , but it is also required for the calculation of the hadronic light - by - light ( hlbyl ) scattering part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( @xmath5 ) , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .    in order to take full advantage from the newly planned @xmath6 experiments at fermilab  @xcite and jparc  @xcite , it is mandatory to improve the accuracy of the hlbyl contribution .",
    "this subject has been recently discussed in detail during the dedicated workshop in seattle ( http://www.int.washington.edu/programs/11-47w/[http://www.int.washington.edu/programs/11-47w/ ] ) .",
    "many important issues related to the @xmath7 interaction have recently been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it has not been feasible so far to develop a rigorous qed / qcd based theoretical description of the two - photon interaction of mesons , which would be applicable at an arbitrary energy scale .",
    "various methods have been used , depending on the aim of a research : the brodsky - lepage ( bl ) high-@xmath3 limit and interpolation formula  @xcite ; the operator product expansion ( ope ) approach to vector - vector - pseudoscalar ( vvp ) and vector - vector - axial ( vva ) three - point functions of qcd  @xcite ; the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) models  @xcite ; the holographic qcd approaches  @xcite ; the qcd sum rules  @xcite ; the modified perturbative approach  @xcite ; the regge models  @xcite ; the dyson - schwinger equation  @xcite ; the nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite , the constituent quark models  @xcite ; the resonance chiral theory approach  @xcite ; and others . the research in this field is mainly dedicated to the high-@xmath3 region of the form factor with one real and one virtual photon .",
    "when one needs to cover a wide range of the photon virtuality , both high - energy and low - energy methods have to be merged in some appropriate way .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : to develop a reliable model able to describe the two - photon form factors of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons with a very small number of parameters and , then , to implement these form factors in the generator ekhara .",
    "our approach is described in section  [ sec : ffs ] .",
    "we start from the formalism of chiral effective theory with resonances  @xcite as a phenomenological model .",
    "the masses of the particles are taken from pdg  @xcite , and the @xmath1@xmath2 mixing is accounted for according to ref .",
    "we require that the form factors vanish at high @xmath8 .",
    "the formulae for the form factors are given in section  [ sec : results ] . in sections  [ sec:1octets ] and  [ sec:2octets : fit ]",
    "we compare the calculated form factors with the experimental results of cello  @xcite , cleo  @xcite and babar  @xcite experiments .",
    "furthermore , in section  [ sec : mc ] , we discuss the implementation of the calculated form factors in the monte carlo generator ekhara  @xcite and simulate the single - tag visible cross section , under conditions similar to those of the cleo and babar experiments .",
    "the derived formulae allow us to study the high-@xmath3 behavior of the form factor ( section  [ sec : limit : high ] ) and the slope of the form factor at the origin ( section  [ sec : slope ] ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] the main conclusions of the paper are drawn .",
    "the two - photon form factor @xmath10 for the meson of type @xmath4 , encodes the dependence of the amplitude @xmath11 on the virtuality of the photons ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) : & & [ ^(q_1 , ) ^(q_2 , ) ] + & & = e^2 _ q_1^ q_2^ f_^^(t_1 , t_2 ) , where @xmath14 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor . note that @xmath15 due to bose symmetry of the photons .",
    "we obtain the formulae for the form factors @xmath16 on the basis of the effective chiral lagrangian  @xcite extended to multi - octet resonance contributions , with the @xmath17 mixing accounted for as in  @xcite .",
    "a brief summary of the model is given in appendix  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "we would like to remark that a similar approach was applied in the context of other processes in  @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we neglect the mixing between the octets , which can be added if required by the data . the diagrams describing @xmath18 transition",
    "are presented in fig  [ fig : gamgampi ] .",
    "the form factors read      |    cr c_q & c_q^ + c_s & -c_s^ +    .    , [ eq : ffetapr_3octet ]    where @xmath19 is a number of the vector meson resonance octets .",
    "the definitions of all couplings can be found in the appendix  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "the vector meson propagators @xmath20 are [ vector - propagator - simple ] d_v(q^2 ) & = & [ q^2 - m_v^2 + _ tot , v ( q^2)]^-1 . in this paper",
    "we consider only the data in the space - like region of photon virtuality , thus the modeling of the vector resonance energy dependent widths @xmath21 is not relevant as the widths are equal to zero .",
    "we take the values of the masses of all particles according to pdg  @xcite .",
    "we require that the form factors @xmath16 given in  ( [ eq : ffpi_3octet ] ) , ( [ eq : ffeta_3octet ] ) and ( [ eq : ffetapr_3octet ] ) vanish when the photon virtuality @xmath22 goes to infinity for any value of @xmath23 : . _",

    "the constraint  ( [ eq : ff_at_inf:1 ] ) leads to the following relations for the couplings : & & h_v_i f_v_i - _",

    "therefore , for an ansatz with @xmath19 vector resonance octets the two - photon form factors @xmath10 are determined by @xmath24 parameters ( i.e. , the products of the couplings : @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , from which @xmath28 are to be determined by experiment and the rest @xmath29 are fixed by  ( [ eq : qcdsum:1b ] ) and  ( [ eq : qcdsum:2b ] ) . for the one octet ansatz",
    "there are no free parameters and in case of the two octets ansatz there is one free parameter .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper was to develop a reliable model for the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) transition form factors in the space - like region reflecting the experimental data and theoretical constrains and in the same time being as simple as possible . even if we know that the @xmath32 flavor symmetry is broken we start our investigations using an @xmath32-symmetric model ( apart from the masses of the mesons , which are fixed at their pdg  @xcite values ) and try to see how many resonance octets we have to include in order to describe the data well",
    "the existing data for the transition form factors in space - like region  @xcite come from single - tag experiments , where one of the invariants is very close to zero ( the one associated with the `` untagged '' lepton ) , thus we have information only about @xmath33 .",
    "it is common to define the @xmath34 form factor @xmath35 with @xmath36 ( associated with the `` tagged '' lepton ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ffpi_3octet ] ) ,  ( [ eq : ffeta_3octet ] ) and  ( [ eq : ffetapr_3octet ] ) we see that @xmath37 is driven by @xmath19 parameters ( i.e. , the products of the couplings : @xmath25 , @xmath27 ) and there is always only one constraint  ( [ eq : qcdsum:2b ] ) for any @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the number of parameters in @xmath37 to be determined by experiment ( `` free parameters '' ) equals to @xmath28 ( similarly to the case of the @xmath16 ) . in case of the one octet ansatz",
    "there are no free parameters and in the two octets case there is one free parameter .      let us consider first the one octet ansatz .",

    ", we include the second vector meson multiplet contributions .",
    "we would like to note that there are many known cases when in order to improve the model predictions one needs to account for the excited vector resonances , the charged form factor of the pion is among the most famous examples .    in the two octet ansatz we chose @xmath40 as a free parameter and",
