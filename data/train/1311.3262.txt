    "the standard cosmological model , i.e. , the @xmath0cdm model @xcite has been well established .",
    "it is consistent with several precise astronomical observations that involve wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , planck satellite @xcite , supernovae cosmology project @xcite .",
    "one of the most important and basic assumptions of the @xmath0cdm model states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales .",
    "however , such a principle faces challenges @xcite . the union2 snia data hint that the universe has a preferred direction @xmath8 in galactic coordinate system @xcite . toward this direction , the universe has the maximum expansion velocity .",
    "astronomical observations @xcite found that the dipole moment of the peculiar velocity field on the direction @xmath9 in the scale of @xmath10 has a magnitude @xmath11 .",
    "this peculiar velocity is much larger than the value @xmath12 given by wmap5 @xcite .",

    "planck collaboration confirms asymmetry of the power spectrums between two preferred opposite hemispheres .",
    "these facts hint that the universe may have a preferred direction .",
    "many models have been proposed to resolve the asymmetric anomaly of the astronomical observations .",

    "the conclusions and remarks are given in sec .",
    "the frw metric describes the homogeneous and isotropic universe . in order to describe the deviation from isotropy , we try to add a scalar perturbation for the frw metric .",
    "the scalar perturbed frw metric is of the form @xmath18 it should be noticed that the scalar perturbation field @xmath19 is time - independent . and the scalar perturbation can be interpreted as a sort of space - dependent spatial curvature . by setting the scale factor @xmath20 , one can find that the spatial ricci tensor of metric ( [ scalar perturbation ] ) is of the form @xmath21 the nonvanishing components of einstein tensor for the metric ( [ scalar perturbation ] ) are given as @xmath22 where the commas denote the derivatives with respect to @xmath23 , the dot denotes the derivatives with respect to cosmic time @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the scalar perturbation breaks homogeneity and isotropy of the universe . since @xmath26 is a perturbation ,",

    "then , following the theory of general relativity , we obtain the specific form of energy - momentum conservation equation for matter and dark energy in the perturbed frw universe ( [ scalar perturbation ] ) .",
    "it is as follows : @xmath39 the equations ( [ conser eq3 ] ) and ( [ conser eq4 ] ) show that the energy density of dark energy remaining constant in our model . by making use of the field equation ( [ eq 0j ] ) ,",
