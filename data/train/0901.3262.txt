    "it is hard to press this part of the definition into some formal property  it depends on the particular theory .",
    "the point is that the definition is only complete if we know what it means to measure the configuration @xmath6  it is some procedure , usually known from the corresponding classical theory .",
    "the details of this procedure do not matter in a general discussion .",

    "the physical definition of the theory is not complete .",

    "everybody knows that one has to apply the same unitary transformation to @xmath19 and @xmath20 as well to preserve physics .",
    "now , with our interpretation of the quotes , we are in no way suggesting that the authors do not recognize this .",
    "the idea that the hamilton operator alone is sufficient is a different one . given the very special form of the hamilton operator , one can imagine that it may be possible to _ reconstruct _ the configuration space @xmath6 more or less uniquely given as an abstract operator on some abstract hilbert space .",
    "last but not least , the straightforward ideas to construct counterexamples fail : one can apply coordinate transformations @xmath21 , but these do not change the physics , and leave the abstract configuration space @xmath6 unchanged .",
    "one can consider a canonical rotation @xmath22 , @xmath23 , but this gives a very strange nonlocal operator of type @xmath24 , which forbids a physical interpretation of the new @xmath25 in terms of a configuration .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that there are only few sufficiently nice choices of @xmath4 which allow a meaningful interpretation of the @xmath4 as configuration space coordinates , and one could hope or expect that these few choices lead , at least approximately , to physically equivalent theories . in this case",
    ", it would be indeed the hamilton operator taken alone , as an abstract operator on a hilbert space , which would be sufficient to define the physics completely .",
    "but this expectation is false , as we will show below .",
    "a really beautiful one - dimensional example of different representations follows from the theory of solutions of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation :    if the function @xmath0 is a solution of the korteweg - de vries equation @xmath26 then the operators @xmath27 for different @xmath2 are unitarily equivalent .    indeed , as has been found by lax ( @xcite ) , the kdv equation is equivalent to the operator equation @xmath28.\\ ] ] for the self - adjoint operator @xmath29 as one can easily check . but this type of operator equations defines , for a self - adjoint operator @xmath30 , a unitary evolution of @xmath31 .",

    "the unitary transformation we need is defined by the equation @xmath32    for results about the existence of solutions of the kdv equation see , for example , @xcite .",
    "this representation leaves and invariant but changes @xmath31 and @xmath33 by @xmath34 resp .",

    "indeed , it is sufficient to define the operators @xmath39 , @xmath40 by @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in this case , the unitary transformation @xmath44 , applied to the operators @xmath45 , gives @xmath46 , thus , the representation of in terms of @xmath41 is @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth to note that the hamiltonian in this theorem does not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "only the operators @xmath41 depend on @xmath2 .",
    "this has the consequence that the representation @xmath47 in terms of these @xmath2-depending operators depends on @xmath2 too .",
    "but is , nonetheless , the same for all @xmath2 .",

    "the inverse scattering method ( developed by @xcite , see @xcite ) for solving the kdv equation gives the following explicit result for the one - dimensional scattering matrix : one of the two coefficients of the scattering matrix , namely @xmath59 , appears to be an integral of motion of the kdv equation .",
    "instead , the reflection coefficient @xmath57 depends explicitly on @xmath2 . to construct an experiment which allows",
    "the measurement of such differences is not difficult ( see fig . [",
    "fig : reflection ] ) . if not a different scattering matrix , what else defines different physics ?",
    "the example we have given is one - dimensional . one can consider a straightforward generalization to higher dimension by considering hamilton operators of the form @xmath60 with different one - dimensional potentials @xmath61 . but all we obtain in this way are only non - interacting degrees of freedom",
    "this seems to leave some hope for the case of non - trivially interacting hamiltonians in higher dimension .",
    "the interactions between different degrees of freedom could , possibly , allow the choice of a preferred basis .",
    "this is , essentially , the way used in the decoherence - based approach for the construction of a preferred basis .",
    "one starts with a `` decomposition into systems '' :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\(o ) the universe consists of systems.@xcite _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    that means , a tensor product structure @xmath62 on the hilbert space of everything .",

    "thus , we can recover the operator @xmath4 on @xmath63 by taking into account the interaction with the environment .",
    "the one - dimensional counterexample , as well as the straightforward non - interacting examples , could be interpreted as irrelevant exceptions , which play no role in the multi - dimensional interacting case .",
    "unfortunately , this construction depends on the predefined tensor product structure .",
    "and this tensor product structure is not unique :    [ th : tensorproduct ] there exists a hamilton operator in a hilbert space such that there exist different tensor product structures @xmath68 with canonical variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 on the factor spaces @xmath71 resp .",
    "@xmath72 so that has in all of them the standard canonical form @xmath73 with a non - trivial interaction potential @xmath74 , which depends non - trivially on @xmath2 .",
    "this can be easily seen in a minor variant of the straightforward multidimensional extension of the kdv example .",
    "let s start with a simple degenerated two - dimensional hamilton operator @xmath75 similar to theorem [ hfixed ] , we choose as well as @xmath76 as fixed , but @xmath77 as depending on @xmath2 .",
    "now , we define the tensor product structure we need by @xmath78 in these variables , the interaction potential is already nontrivial .",
    "but , it has yet the same nice standard canonical form , and as in theorem [ hfixed ] , the resulting potential @xmath79 is of comparable nice quality for different @xmath2 .",

    "this is to use the fact that the simplified version of decoherence already allows the unique derivation of the positions @xmath80 as the decoherence - preferred observables , for the given tensor product structure @xmath81 .",
    "but , on the other hand , the result is obviously not unique .",
    "this contradiction disappears once we recognize that the tensor product structure is not unique .",
    "but the @xmath2-dependence of the tensor product structure can be seen directly as well : if the tensor product structure would be the same for different @xmath2 , we would be able to express @xmath82 as a function @xmath83 .",
    "but an attempt to express @xmath82 in this way fails for a general @xmath36  there is no chance to get rid of the dependence on @xmath84 :    @xmath85    let s emphasize again that the operator does not depend on @xmath2 . only the operators @xmath86 depend on @xmath2 .",

    "but , maybe the decoherence - based reconstruction of the configuration space basis is , nonetheless , worth something ?",
    "last but not least , even if it depends on some other structure  does nt it , nonetheless , explain something important about the fundamental nature of the configuration space ?",
    "we do nt think so , and the aim of this section is to explain why .",
    "note that we do not want to question at all that there are lot s of useful non - fundamental applications of this construction  applications where a subdivision into systems is defined by the application .",
    "the systems in these applications will be various measurement instruments and state preparation devices , various parts of the environment , and the quantum system which is interesting in the particular application .",
    "the preferred basis , constructed in this way , is also application - dependent . while it may be very important to find such a basis for a particular application , these constructions seem irrelevant in considerations of the foundations of physics .",
    "a variant is to start from a tensor product decomposition given by the fundamental , postulated configuration space @xmath87 .",
    "the resulting decoherence - preferred basis may be different from the position basis and better suited for the consideration of the classical limit .",
    "but this would be a non - fundamental application as well , with no relevance for the foundations of quantum theory , which is , in this variant , postulated in the usual way .",
    "the only variant which seems relevant for fundamental physics is to replace the a - priori definition of the configuration space in canonical quantum theories as well as pilot wave theories by the decoherence - based construction of the preferred basis , based on some fundamental tensor product structure .    to evaluate this replacement",
    ", we have to compare it with the standard alternative  to postulate the configuration space @xmath6 as a predefined , non - dynamical structure .",
    "first , the above competitors depend on predefined , non - dynamical structures , which are introduced into the theory in an axiomatic way .",
    "the standard approach postulates the configuration space @xmath6 itself , and the decoherence - based construction postulates a tensor product structure . in this sense , they are on equal footing .",
    "but the resulting structure  the configuration space @xmath6  is , in the standard approach , a predefined , non - dynamical object . instead , in the decoherence - based construction",
    ", it depends on dynamics .",
    "this dependence of @xmath6 on dynamics has at least one obvious disadvantage : we can no longer define the dynamics in the canonical way as @xmath88 which uses simple and natural structures on @xmath6  the laplace operator @xmath89 on @xmath6 , as well as the special subclass of multiplication operators in @xmath90 , and , in addition , some special function @xmath91 like @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , such a definition of in terms of @xmath6 would become circular .",
    "thus , we loose a nice and simple way to define the dynamics of the theory",
    ". we would have to define the dynamics in some other way .",
    "we can expect that this other way is more complex , and less beautiful .",
    "thus , for the emergent , derived character of @xmath6 we have to pay . in itself , this is not untypical for emergent objects : we have to pay some costs for the possibility to explain them . in a previous theory , they have been postulated as fundamental , simple , independent objects , with some nice , well - defined properties . in the new theory , which derives them as emergent objects , they become more complex , often with uncertain boundaries , and they depend on other objects and structures .",
    "nonetheless , the special character of the loss in our case seems untypical even for emergent objects .",
    "usually , the structures which depend on the objects which now become emergent , are or of some higher , emergent level already in the previous theory , or they become emergent together with these objects in the new theory .",
    "i do nt know of an example of an object which depends on another object in the old theory , and then the other object becomes emergent , but the object itself remains fundamental , as it would be the case for .",
    "( of course , this could happen , but it would indicate that the dependencies were wrong already in the old theory . )",
    "thus , i would characterize the costs related with the dependence of @xmath6 on the dynamics as higher than usual for emergent objects .",
    "let s consider now what we gain .",
    "usually , if an object becomes emergent which was previously fundamental , our gain is explanatory power .",
    "do we have such a gain in our case ? here , we have to take into account that we need another , postulated structure  the tensor product structure  to construct @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we can `` explain '' the configuration space @xmath6 only in a relative sense , in comparison with the unexplained , postulated tensor product structure .",
    "now , explaning one structure in terms of another may also give large explanatory power .",
    "last but not least , in some sense all our more fundamental theories are of this type  they explain the previously postulated objects and structures in terms of some more fundamental , but also postulated , objects and structures .",
    "but we would talk about explanatory power only if the new , more fundamental structure has some advantages in simplicity , beauty , generality , or whatever else .",
    "what is the situation in our case ?",
    "at least i can not see any advantage .",
    "instead , i see a lot of disadvantages :    first , we have simple examples of quantum theories which have natural configuration spaces but do not have a ( similarly natural ) tensor product structure : for example , finite - dimensional quantum theories with prime dimension do not have nontrivial tensor product structures .",
    "indeed , from follows @xmath93 , thus the only possible tensor product structure for a space with prime dimensnion is the trivial one , which is worthless because it does not allow the start of the decoherence procedure .",
    "then we have spaces of identical particles , which are factor spaces of a tensor product , but do not have their own natural to an arbitrary basis @xmath94 of . ]",
    "tensor product structure .",
    "last but not least , for topologically sufficiently non - trivial manifolds @xmath6 , starting with @xmath95 , there exists no decomposition @xmath96 into factor - manifolds @xmath97 , and therefore no natural tensor product structure .",
    "but for all these hilbert spaces we have natural configuration spaces .    then , the tensor product structure is often less symmetric in comparison with the configuration space .",
    "the simplest example is the tensor product structure of @xmath98 of one - particle theory , which destroys rotational symmetry .",
    "in addition , the tensor product structure based on points in field theory requires an identification of points in different time slices , if considered as fixed over time , destroying galilean or relativistic symmetry .",
    "these arguments seem sufficient to argue that a tensor product structure , as a fundamental object , is worse than a configuration space .",
    "thus , an explanation of @xmath6 in terms of a more fundamental tensor product structure has no explanatory power at all . the gain which we usually want to reach by deriving structures previously considered to be fundamental , namely explanatory power ,",
    "can not be reached in this approach .",
    "moreover , this can not be hailed in some way , say , by deriving the tensor product structure from something else .",
    "the hamilton operator alone is not sufficient , as shown by our counterexample .",
    "thus , one needs some additional structure anyway .",
    "therefore , the main line of our argumentation remains intact .",
    "the construction combines only disadvantages : the lack of explanatory power of postulated objects , with the uncertainty and dependency of emergent objects .",
    "what remains intact is also the dependence of @xmath6 on the dynamics , and therefore the very special loss of the possibility to define the dynamics as @xmath99 on @xmath6 .",
    "what also remains is the simplicity and the general and very natural character of postulating a configuration space @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , whatever the new additional structure , we can not expect a large gain in explanatory power .",
    "given this situation , there seem to be no gains but only losses , in a construction which constructs the configuration space @xmath6 postulated in canonical quantum theories and pilot wave theories using decoherence techniques , starting from a fundamental tensor product structure ( or some replacement ) .",
    "we have shown that it is not the hamilton operator alone which defines the physics of quantum theories .",
    "in addition , one needs the canonical configuration space @xmath6 , or some similar structure , which connects this hamilton operator with observable configurations .    as a consequence , hopes to derive the configuration space basis using decoherence techniques from a hamilton operator taken alone have to be given up .",
    "such constructions necessarily depend on some additional structure , like a `` subdivision into systems '' , which have to be postulated .",
    "the derivation of the configuration space basis from such additional structures combines the disadvantages of predefined structures ( lack of explanatory power ) and emergent structures ( dependence on dynamics ) without giving any advantages thus loses in comparison with a simply postulated configuration space .",
    "if these arguments against a decoherence - based construction of the preferred basis are of any relevance for everettians is a completely different question .",
    "they may also completely ignore the non - uniqueness and follow some reasoning like this :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ suppose that there were several such decompositions , each supporting information - processing systems . then the fact that we observe one rather than another is a fact of purely local signicance : we happen to be information - processing systems in one set of decoherent histories rather than another .",
