    "the short dynamical time scales and coherence of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in accreting xrb s strongly suggest that qpos can * *  * * provide valuable information on the accretion dynamics in the innermost parts of these systems . in this respect",
    "the discovery of low 20 - 50 hz qpos in luminous neutron star ( ns ) binaries by van der klis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , kilohertz qpos in ns s by strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and hectohertz qpo s in bh s by morgan , remillard & greiner ( 1997 ) opened a new era in the study of the dynamics near compact objects .",
    "following these discoveries psaltis , belloni & van der klis ( 1999 ) , hereafter pbk , demonstrated that these ns and bh low and high frequencies follow a remarkably tight correlation .",
    "these features are the horizontal branch oscillations  ( hbo ) along with low frequency noise lorentzian , @xmath7 and the lower khz qpo @xmath5 for ns and bh respectively .",
    "belloni , psaltis & van der klis ( 2002 ) , hereafter bpk , have updated pbk s correlation adding data from nowak ( 2000 ) , boirin et al .",

    "( 2001 ) and nowak et al .",
    "pbk suggest that the low and high frequencies correlate in a way that seems to depend only weakly on the properties of the sources , such the mass , magnetic field , or possibly the presence of a hard surface in compact object .",
    "mauche ( 2002 ) has reported low and high frequency qpo s in the dwarf nova ss cygni and vw hyi ( see wouldt & warner 2002 for for the vw hyi observations ) and has called attention to the fact that these qpo s extend the correlation of pbk downward in frequency by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "this frequency correlation observed over such a broad range of sources indicates that a common phenomenon is responsible for qpos in compact objects and raises the question whether one can find a observational relations which would distinguish bh candidates from other compact sources .",
    "the comparative study of spectral and qpo features in bh candidate sources has yielded important information which can help answer this question . as far as spectral properties are concerned , there is increasing observational evidence that the large complex of  spectral states  originally devised by belloni ( 2000 ) to classify the highly variable x - ray spectra of bh galactic sources like grs 1915 + 105 , can be reduced to a few simple configurations [ see e.g. mcclintock and remillard ( 2003 ) and belloni ( 2003 ) ] : ( 1 ) a low hard power law dominated state where the photon spectral index is near 1.5 ; ( 2 ) a steep power law state in which the index is about 2.7 ; ( 3 ) and a thermally dominated state .",
    "the observed variability is explained by transitions between these three canonical configurations .    low frequency ( 1 - 10 hz ) qpo s are generally observed to present in states ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , during transitions between states ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) but never in ( 3 ) .",
    "both high and low frequency qpo s have been thought to be associated with the accretion disk , though their specific origin has not widely understood ( although see titarchuk & wood 2002 , hereafter tw02 , for explanation of their origin ) .",
    "attempts to find consistent correlations with observable disk parameters have lead to mixed results .",
    "in particular , there are so many exceptions to the observed correlations of frequency to disk spectral values sometimes observed that no general statement about the relation of the qpo with any spectral parameter solely associated with the disk , such as thermal flux , temperature , inner radius , etc . can be made .",
    "for example , exceptions to one of the most widely quoted correlations , i.e. between disk flux and frequency , have been presented for the well studied micro - quasar grs 1915 + 105 by fiorito , markwardt , & swank ( 2003 ) and  for xte 1550 - 564  by remillard et .",
    "al . ( 2002a , b ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "a number of recent studies have revealed consistent and robust correlations between the photon index of the power - law component of the x - ray spectrum and low qpo frequency .",
    "such strong correlations are observed the well - studied bh binary , grs 1915 + 105 in almost all situations in which the qpo is observable and in several other bh s over a wide range of observations and states .",
    "these studies include :    \\a .",
    "a comprehensive study of correlations between photon index and qpo frequency in bh sources by vignarca et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; these results show strong correlations between index and qpo frequency as well as saturation of the index between at the values @xmath9 and @xmath10 for several bh sources and for the same source in different states .",
    "recent studies by kalemci ( 2002 ) for a number of galactic bh x - ray transients observed during outburst decay which confirm the persistence of the correlation between frequency and index during state transitions .",
    "our own studies of grs 1915 + 105 of @xmath11 states ( fiorito , markwardt , & swank 2003 ) , in which strong correlation of qpo frequency with power - law index have been observed ; such states have been traditionally noted as low brightness , power law dominated states ( see e.g. belloni et al .",
    "1999 ) where the disk is at least tenuous if not undetectable altogether .",
    "studies tracing the qpo frequency and index over time between state transitions shows that the frequency tracks the index during state evolution ( homan , et .",
    "al . 2001 ) and sobczak et al . ( 1999 , 2000 ) from a value of about @xmath9 to about @xmath10 , as the qpo frequency varies from about 1 to 10 hz .",
    "the persistence of the correlation of index with qpo frequency and its tracking with respect to time suggests that the underlying physical process or condition which gives rise to the low frequency qpo are tied to the corona ; and , furthermore , that this process varies in a well defined manner as the source progresses from one state to another .",
    "moreover , the fact that the same correlations are seen in so many galactic x - ray binary bh sources , which vary widely in both luminosity ( presumably with mass accretion rate ) and state , suggests that the physical conditions controlling the index and the low frequency qpos are characteristics of these sources , and by virtue of the low - high - frequency correlations of pbk - bpk , may be a universal property of _ all _ accreting compact systems .",
    "the above data have motivated us to develop a detailed model of the physics of the corona surrounding a bh s which directly predicts the behavior of the spectral index with fundamental properties of the corona .",
    "the model we have developed incorporates fundamental principles of fluid mechanics , radiative transfer theory and oscillatory processes .",
    "it identifies the origin of the qpo as a fundamental property of a compact coronal region near the bh and shows how the photon index of this corona changes as a function of mass accretion rate .",
    "it has been already shown in a number of papers ( see below ) that the absence of the firm surface in the bhs leads to the development of the very strong converging flow when the mass accretion rate is higher than eddington rate @xmath12 .",
    "the main observational features of the converging flow should be seen in high / soft phase , while the thermal comptonization spectrum of the soft ( presumably disk ) photons should be seen in the hard phase .    in series of papers ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 , hereafter ct95 ; titarchuk , mastichiadis & kylafis 1996 , 1997 ; ebisawa , titarchuk & chakrabarti 1996 ; titarchuk & zannias 1998 ; shrader & titarchuk 1998 , 1999 ; borozdin et al .",
    "1999 ; laurent & titarchuk 1999 , 2001 , hereafter lt99 and lt01 respectively ; titarchuk & shrader 2002 ; turolla , zane & titarchuk 2002 ) the authors argue that the drain properties of black horizon are necessarily related to the bulk inflow in bh sources and that the spectral and timing features of this bulk inflow are really detected in the x - ray observations of bhs .",
    "the signatures of the inflow are :    \\i .",
    "an extended steep power law where the photon index saturates to the value @xmath10 as the mass accretion rate increases - the precise value of the index is a function of the temperature of the flow but its relatively high value is a result of inefficient photon upscattering in the converging flow due to photon trapping .",
    "lt99 demonstrated that the spectral photon index varies in narrow range from 3 to 2.7 with mass accretion rate ( in eddington units ) increases from 2 to 7 .",
    "moreover , lt99 demonstrated using monte carlo simulations that in the low hard state when the plasma temperature is of order 50 kev the bulk inflow spectrum is practically identical to thermal comptonization spectrum ( there is no any noticeable effect of the bulk comptonization in the spectrum ) .",
    "in fact , the effect of the bulk comptonization compared to thermal one is getting stronger when the plasma temperature drops below 10 kev .",
    "the small variation of the photon index around 1.7 is a characteristic signature of the low hard state that was pointed out in earlier work by ct95 and later it was confirmed by lt99 .",
    "\\ii . the qpo high frequency ( 100 - 300 hz ) , which is inversely proportional to bh mass .",
    "it is worth noting that the qpo frequency scales as @xmath13 is a generic feature of any qpo model in which qpo frequency is scaled with the schwarzchild radius .",
    "furthermore , titarchuk , osherovich & kuznetsov ( 1999 ) , hereafter tok , presented observational evidence that the variability of the hard x - ray radiation in ns s and bh s occurs _ in a bounded configuration_. ford & van der klis ( 1998 ) found that the break frequency in the power density spectrum ( pds ) is correlated with qpo frequency for some particular ns sources ( 4u 1728 - 32 ) .",
    "wijnands & van der klis ( 1999 ) later found a similar correlation in bh sources .",
    "titarchuk & osherovich ( 1999 ) , hereafter to99 , and tok explained this correlation in nss and bhs respectively .",
    "they argue the observed pds is the power spectrum of an exponential shot , @xmath14 which is the response of the diffusion propagation to any perturbation in a bounded medium .",
    "the inverse of the characteristic diffusion time @xmath15 and the normal mode qpo frequency @xmath16 has a well defined relation to the size of the bounded configuration , because @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the specific pertrubation ( magneto - sonic ) velocity and @xmath20 is a charactestic size of the configuration ( see to99 ) .",
    "titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 ) , hereafter tlm98 proposed that this bounded configuration ( cavity ) surrounding compact objects is the transition layer ( tl ) that is formed as a result of dynamical adjustments of a keplerian disk to the innermost sub - keplerian boundary conditions .",
    "they argued that this type of adjustment is a generic feature of the keplerian flow in the presence of the sub - keplerian boundary conditions near the central object and that it does not necessarily require the presence or absence of a hard surface .",
    "tlm98 concluded that an isothermal sub - keplerian transition layer between the ns surface and its last keplerian orbit forms as a result of this adjustment .",
    "the tl model is general and is applicable to both ns and black hole systems .",
    "the primary problem in both ns and bh systems is understanding how the flow changes from pure keplerian to the sub - keplerian as the radius decreases to small values .",
    "tlm98 suggested that the discontinuities and abrupt transitions in their solution result from derivatives of quantities such as angular velocities ( weak shocks ) .",
    "they were first to put forth the possibility of the transition layer formation to explain most observed qpos in bright low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "in figure 1 we illustrate the main idea of the transition layer concept for ns s ans bh s .    in this _",
    "paper _ , we explain the general correlation between photon index and low frequency in the frameworks of the transition layer model and we give more arguments for the nature of the spectral phases ( states ) and phase transition observed in bhs . the main features of the tl model are given in  2.1 the formulation of the problem of low frequency oscillations and the relationship with ma oscillations in the transition layer are also described in  2.1 .",
    "the coronal model and the spectral index - optical depth relation is given in  2.2 .",
    "the derivation of the low frequency - index correlation and the details of modeling of the spectral phase transition are present in  2.3 .",
    "we analyze specific qpo and spectral data in terms of the tl model in  3 .",
    "we discuss the signatures and the methods of the identification of bh and ns sources using timing and spectral characteristics in  4 .",
    "our summary and conclusions also follow in  4 .",
    "tlm98 define the transition layer as a region confined between the the inner sub - keplerian disk boundary and the first keplerian orbit ( for the tl geometry , see fig . 1 and fig . 1 in tlm98 and tok ) .",
    "the main idea at the basis of our investigation is that a keplerian accretion disc is forced to attain sub - keplerian rotation close to the central object ( a neutron star or a black hole ) .",
    "the transition between the keplerian and the sub - keplerian flow takes place in a relatively narrow , shock - like region [ the size of the region of order radius of the central object ( ns , bh ) ] where dissipation occurs . as a consequence , the gas temperature increases and the disc puffs up , forming a hot corona .",
    "then the corona intercepts the soft disc photons , up - scatter them via thermal and dynamical comptonization finally giving rise to the hard power - law tail .",
    "the power - law index value strongly depends on the coronal optical depth and temperature ( see ct95 , tmk97 , lt99 ) . when the mass accretion rate in the disk increases and consequently the disk soft photon flux increases , the corona is drastically cooled down to a temperature of order 5 - 10 kev ( in  2.2 we present a detailed analysis of this effect ) .",
    "for such a low plasma temperature the bulk motion of the converging flow is more efficient in upscattering disk photons than thermal comptonization .",
    "furthermore , the indices saturates to the asymptotic values around 2.7 as the mass accretion rate of the converging flow increases .",
    "the exact asymptotic value of the index is determined by the plasma temperature only ( lt99 ) .",
    "tlm98 evaluate the size of the transition layer @xmath20 as a function of a nondimensional paramerer @xmath21 ( often called the reynolds number ) which is the inverse of the @xmath22 parameter for the accretion flow ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 , hereafter ss73 ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the accretion rate in the disk , @xmath25 is a half - thickness of a disk , @xmath26 is a characteristic radial velocity at a given radius @xmath27 in the disk , @xmath28 is electron ( proton ) number density , @xmath29 is the proton mass and @xmath30 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "@xmath30 can be defined as @xmath31 using the turbulent velocity and the related turbulent scale , respectively or as @xmath32 for the magnetic case where @xmath33 is the conductivity ( e.g. see details of the @xmath34definition in lang 1998 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the viscosity @xmath35 is a function of @xmath36 .",
    "because @xmath21 is related to @xmath37 and the tl thomson optical depth @xmath38 , which is a product of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the tl inner and the outer radius respectively ) , electron number density @xmath28 and thomson cross - section @xmath42 ( namely , @xmath43 ) are both related to @xmath37 one can , in principle , determine @xmath38 as a function of @xmath44parameter .",
    "because of the uncertainties of the disk equation of the state , of the viscosity @xmath35 in the disk there is still uncertainty in the precise determination of this @xmath45relation .",
    "we address to this issue in  2.3 .",
    "tlm98 determine the @xmath46dependence using the equation of motion in the disk where the radial motion is controlled by friction and the angular momentum exchange between adjacent layers , resulting in the loss of initial angular momentum by the accreting matter ( e.g. ss73 ) .",
    "we define an adjustment point where a keplerian accretion disc is forced to attain sub - keplerian rotation close to the central object ( ns or bh ) . in order to determine the adjustment radius",
    "one should solve this equation of motion subject to three boundary conditions  ",
    "one at the innermost disk radius @xmath40 and two at the adjustment radius @xmath41  ",
    "namely , at @xmath40 the disk rotational frequency matches the rotational frequency of the central object ( spin ) , at @xmath41 there is no break in the rotational frequency and the left - hand and right - hand side derivatives of r are equal .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath44parameter the rotational frequency profile @xmath47 and the outer radius of the transition layer are uniquely determined by the three boundary conditions and the equation of motion ( see for example , eqs . 8 - 9 in t099 ) .",
    "the adjustment of the keplerian disk to the sub - keplerian inner boundary creates conditions favorable for the formation of a hot plasma outflow at the outer boundary of the transition layer , because the keplerian motion ( if it is followed by sub - keplerian motion ) must pass through the super - keplerian centrifugal barrier region ( tlm98 ) .",
    "the equation ( see tlm98 , eq .",
    "11 , or to99 , eq .",
    "9 ) determines @xmath41 as a function of @xmath21 . for given values of",
    "@xmath48 one can find values of the keplerian frequencies @xmath49 ( see eq . 1 in to99 ) .",
    "for example for the observed range of the high qpo frequencies in bh sources , from 1 to 100 hz ( the low qpo frequencies from 0.1 to 10 hz ) ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and for a bh mass of ten solar masses one can find from tlm98 eq . ( 11 ) that @xmath21 varies from 2 to 20 ( a variation which is related to the mass accretion rate @xmath50 see eq .",
    "[ eq : rey ] ) .",
    "we remind a reader that in the framework of the tlm these high qpo frequencies are interpreted as keplerian frequencies @xmath51 at @xmath41 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the literature @xmath52 is treated as a constant and a free parameter independent of the mass accretion rate ( or the spectral state ) , whereas we find that @xmath53 varies from 0.5 to 0.05 with @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath53 is a very strong function of @xmath37 .",
    "soria ( 1999 ) inferred the effective value of the viscosity @xmath54parameter as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "he showed that regardless of the true viscosity in the disk the @xmath54 parameter is always higher than @xmath55 if the ratio of the magnetic pressure @xmath56 to the gas pressure @xmath57 is about 10% and more .",
    "below ( see also tw02 for details ) we show that using the low frequency - high frequency correlation the inferred ratio of @xmath58 that is consistent with the values of @xmath59 and the soria s predictions of the high values of @xmath53 as @xmath60 the tl model identifies the low frequency qpo as that associated with the viscous magnetoacoustic ( ma ) oscillation of the bounded tl ; this mode is common to both bh s and ns s .",
    "the correlation of the ma frequency with the gravitational ( keplerian ) frequency @xmath61 were derived by to99 , titarchuk , bradshaw & wood ( 2001 ) for ns and then it was generalized by tw02 , for bh and wd .",
    "the ma frequency is derived as the eigenfrequency of the boundary - value problem resulting from a mhd treatment of the interaction of the disk with the magnetic field .",
    "the problem is solved for two limiting boundary conditions which encompass realistic possibilities .",
    "the solution yields a velocity identified as a mixture of the sound speed and the alfvn velocity .",
    "the tbw treatment does not specify how the eigenfrequency is excited or damped .",
    "however , it makes clear that the qpo is a readily stimulated resonant frequency [ see titarchuk , cui & wood ( 2002 ) and titarchuk ( 2002 ) for details of excitation of the eigenfrequencies ] .",
    "a linear relation was derived between @xmath8 and @xmath6 ( see fig . 2 and tw02 )",
    "@xmath62 where @xmath63^{1/2}(h / r_{out})$ ] is a proportionality coefficient which is universal  to the extent that @xmath64 and @xmath65 remain about the same from one source to the next . here",
    "@xmath66 is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure and the coefficient @xmath67 for stiff and free boundary conditions respectively and @xmath25 is the half - width of the keplerian part of the disk .",
    "identification of @xmath68 , with @xmath69 respectively , leads tw02 to determination of @xmath70 and @xmath71 using the observed value of @xmath72 . on the other hand @xmath73 at the adjustment radius @xmath41 as of function of @xmath44parameter",
    "can be readily obtained using eq .",
    "( 9 ) in to99 [ see above for details of @xmath74 determination ] .",
    "thus , as a result of the identification of @xmath7 with @xmath8 , we obtain the relation of @xmath75 as a function of @xmath21 , namely @xmath76 in figure 3 we present the inferred @xmath7 as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "we derive this relation using equations ( 9 ) in to99 with the assumptions that @xmath77 ( see eq . 7 in to99 for definition @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 .",
    "it is evident that the inferred @xmath68 are inversely proportional to @xmath80 because @xmath81 and @xmath82 where @xmath20 is the tl characteristic size which is proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "we calculate the outer radius of the tl , @xmath83 as a function of @xmath7 using relations [ eq.[eq : ma ] ( or eq . [ high - low ] ) here and eqs . 1 , 9 in to99 ] , keeping in mind that @xmath84 .",
    "because the radius of interest , which in our case is the outer tl boundary radius @xmath41 , is related to @xmath6 one can relate @xmath41 to @xmath7 using formula ( [ high - low ] ) .",
    "we present this function in figure 4 .",
    "the spectral index@xmath85frequency correlation can be derived if we find a spectral index@xmath85tl optical depth correlation . because @xmath21 is is a function of the mass accretion rate @xmath37 and the optical depth @xmath86 is a function of @xmath37 ,  we are lead to a correlation of @xmath7 and @xmath86 and ultimately to the index@xmath85frequency correlation .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath21 and @xmath38 dependences on @xmath36 implies that a correlation between these quantities exist _ but does not mean a linear correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath38 because @xmath44parameter also depends on the accretion flow viscosity @xmath35 _ which is also a function of @xmath36 .",
    "the tl model first proposed by tlm98 naturally provides a compact corona for comptonization upscattering of the illuminating accretion disk photons which is just the region of adjustment of keplerian accretion flow ( disk ) to the sub - keplerian innner boundary condition .",
    "the essential sub - keplerian rotation of ns in lmxbs is a well established observational fact due to the direct measurements of ns spins ( which are in the range of 200 - 400 hz , see the review by van der klis 2000 for details ) .",
    "thus it is quite reasonable that the presence of a tl for nss exists . in the case of bhs",
    "no direct spin measurements are yet available and hence the presence of the tl may at first glance seem less clear . on the other hand , the bulk motion comptonization model which requires",
    "the existence of the innermost region of non keplerian flow onto a slowly rotating or static schwarschild bh , is very consistent with observations and in fact its signature is the saturation of the photon index which is observed ( see lt01 for details ) and thus one can conclude that fast rotating kerr bh is ruled out by the observations .",
    "in fact , there is no space between the the inner edge of the disk and the horizon in the fast rotating kerr bh to upscatter the disk soft photons by the bulk motion to the energies of order 500 kev that are detected in the high energy observations ( grove et al .",
    "thus we can reasonably conclude that bh may also undergo sub - keplerian rotation and the existence of a tl for slowly rotating bhs .",
    "it is likely that this adjustment to sub - keplerian flow is not smooth and that near the adjustment radius the strong or weak shocks can be formed .",
    "the adjustment radius ( shock ) region can be treated as a potential wall at which the accreting matter releases its gravitational energy in a geometrically thin target . as a consequence of this",
    "the shock plasma temperature is much higher than that in the surrounding regions of the keplerian disk .",
    "the shock region gets puffed up oscillating with frequencies close to @xmath6 ( titarchuk 2003 ) .",
    "additional oscillations can appear ( at least in ns case ) because of the rotational configuration above the disk which is a magnetosphere in ns case ( see details in tok ) .",
    "the shock formation leads to the formation of the hot inner bounded region .",
    "the hard photons in the shocked region illuminate the surrounding material evaporating some part of the disk .",
    "it is obvious that the evaporated fraction depends on the mass accretion rate in the disk ( see ct95 ) .",
    "some small fraction of the hard photons ( at maximum 6 % ) can be reflected by the cold parts of the disk ( ct95 and see also basko , sunyaev & titarchuk 1974 ) .",
    "let us assume the column density of this region @xmath87 is a few grams or that the thomson optical thickness @xmath86 is a few ( see ss73 for the thickness estimate of the innermost part of the disk ) .",
    "the rate of energy release at this region @xmath88 is a few percent of  the eddington luminosity since the adjustment radius is located within 4 - 100 schwarzschild radii ( see fig .",
    "the heating of gas due to the gravitational energy release should be balanced by the photon emission . for high plasma temperature , comptonization and free - free emission",
    "is the main cooling channel , and the heating of electrons is presumably due to the coulomb collisions with protons ( see fig . 1 for the picture of disk corona ) .    under such physical conditions",
    "the energy balance can be written as [ see also zeldovich & shakura ( 1969 ) , hereafter zs69 and tlm98 ] @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the optical depth within the shock , @xmath91 is a distribution function for the radiative energy distribution , @xmath92 is the relativistic correction factor , @xmath93 is the electron temperature in k , @xmath94 cm s@xmath95 k@xmath95 and @xmath96 erg k@xmath97 cm s@xmath95 are a dimensional constants . in this formula",
    "we neglect the gas heating due to recoil effect . the distribution @xmath91 is obtained from the solution of the diffusion equation ( zs69 ) , @xmath98 subject to two boundary conditions . here",
    "we assume that the region of the gravitational energy release ( corona ) is a spherical shell surrounding the central object and the total flux in the corona is a sum @xmath99 of the gravitational energy release @xmath88 and the illumination flux from outside of the corona ( disk ) @xmath100 .",
    "the inner and outer boundary conditions for a bh corona are that there are no scattered radiation from outside of the corona .",
    "then in the eddington approximation ( see sobolev 1975 ) the boundary conditions can be written as follows : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are at the inner and outer boundaries respectively .    for",
    "a ns corona one should assume that inside of the inner corona boundary the energy density @xmath104constant , namely that the radiation flux emitted towards the central object at some point of the inner boundary returns back ( reflected by the ns surface ) , namely this condition is equivalent to the reflection condition : @xmath105 below we present a general formula of the coronal temperature which combines the bh and ns cases .",

    "furthermore , we take a representative value of @xmath108 for the maximum value in the corona which is very close to mean value of @xmath109 i.e. @xmath110.\\ ] ] in order to approximate the coronal temperature . in figure 5",
    "we present the results of calculations of the temperatures @xmath111 ( kev ) and the energy spectral indices of the comptonization spectrum @xmath53 ( photon index @xmath112 ) as a function of the optical depth of the shell @xmath86 .",
    "the different curves of @xmath113 are related to the different ratios of @xmath114 .",

    "in fact , the calculation results weakly depend on @xmath119 and @xmath88 if @xmath120 is of order a few or less . in this case",

    "<S> recent studies have shown that strong correlations are observed between the low frequencies ( 1 - 10 hz ) of quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) and the spectral power law index of several black hole ( bh ) candidate sources , in low hard state , steep power - law ( soft ) state and in transition between these states . </S>",
    "<S> the observations indicate that the x - ray spectrum of such state ( phases ) show the presence of a power - law component and are sometimes related to simultaneous radio emission indicated the probable presence of a jet . </S>",
    "<S> strong qpos ( @xmath0 rms ) are present in the power density spectrum in the spectral range where the power - law component is dominant ( i.e. 60 - 90% ) . </S>",
    "<S> this evidence contradicts the dominant long standing interpretation of qpos as a signature of the thermal accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> we present the data from the literature and our own data to illustrate the dominance of power - law index - qpo frequency correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a model , that identifies and explains the origin of the qpos and how they are imprinted on the properties of power - law flux component . </S>",
    "<S> we argue the existence of a bounded compact coronal region which is a natural consequence of the adjustment of keplerian disk flow to the innermost sub - keplerian boundary conditions near the central object and that ultimately leads to the formation of a transition layer ( tl ) between the adjustment radius and the innermost boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts two phases or states dictated by the photon upscattering produced in the tl : ( 1 ) hard state , in which the tl is optically thin and very hot ( @xmath1 50 kev ) producing photon upscattering via thermal componization ; the photon spectrum index @xmath2 for this state is dictated by gravitational energy release and compton cooling in an optically thin shock near the adjustment radius ;  ( 2 ) a soft state which is optically thick and relatively cold ( @xmath3 5 kev ) ;  the index for this state , @xmath4 is determined by soft - photon upscattering and photon trapping in converging flow into bh .  in the tl model for corona the qpo frequency @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> is related to the gravitational ( close to keplerian ) frequency @xmath6 at the outer ( adjustment ) radius and @xmath7 is related to the tl s normal mode ( magnetoacoustic ) oscillation frequency @xmath8 . the observed correlations between index and low and high qpo frequencies are readily explained in terms of this model . </S>",
