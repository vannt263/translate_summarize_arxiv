    "the recent discovery of near perfect fluidity of hot qcd matter at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite brought a lot of attention and interest in modeling the collective phenomena in relativistic heavy - ion collisions using the relativistic dissipative fluid dynamical approach .",
    "in contrast to perfect fluid dynamical models , dissipative fluids provide a more accurate and physically more plausible description incorporating first and second order corrections compared to perfect fluids .",
    "these higher order corrections are irreversible ; thermal conductivity and dissipation , related to temperature gradients and inhomogeneities of the flow field . a linear relation between the two establishes transport equations , where the parameters entering these equations are the so - called transport coefficients , for thermal conductivity @xmath0 , shear viscosity @xmath1 , and bulk viscosity @xmath2 , also referred to as second viscosity or volume viscosity @xcite .",
    "recently many studies have specifically investigated the fluid dynamical description of matter created at rhic including shear viscosity , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "some of these calculations @xcite made use of the first order theory by eckart @xcite , and landau and lifshitz @xcite , but the main focus was on the second order causal theory of dissipative fluid dynamics by israel and stewart @xcite , and the theory by ttinger and grmela @xcite .",
    "these calculations particularly examined the effect of a small shear viscosity motivated by the conjectured lower bound from the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "it was found only recently that , contrary to perturbative qcd estimates @xcite , lattice qcd reveals a large increase of the bulk viscosity near the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "this numerical evidence motivates studies of the evolution of matter with large viscosity .",
    "it has also been suggested that a large bulk viscosity near @xmath3 may entirely change the standard picture of adiabatic hadronization employed so far in hydrodynamical models @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the phenomena related to viscous evolution of matter in 1 + 1 dimensional systems neglecting the contribution of heat conduction .",
    "we focus on the numerical implementation of both the 1st - order and 2nd - order approaches and investigate specific test cases to clarify numerical aspects and accuracy of the solutions .",
    "this represents an important first step before multi - dimensional models can be constructed and applied .",
    "we also show how the relaxation equations for the dissipative corrections in the 2nd - order theory can be solved efficiently and accurately also via the flux corrected transport algorithm by writing them in the form of continuity equations with a source .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we briefly recapitulate and formulate the equations of dissipative fluid dynamics and the numerical method which will be used to solve the respective equations .",
    "afterwards we present and discuss the results in several cases .",

    "these can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ baryon],[energymomentum],[entropy ] ) using different approaches .",
    "to study the various methods is out of the scope of the current manuscript , however these theories and recent new phenomenological development aimed to extend the theory of dissipative fluids sheds light on the open questions related to the ambiguities on this matter , see for example @xcite and references therein .    in the 1st - order theories of eckart @xcite or landau and lifshitz @xcite ,",
    "i.e. , the relativistic navier - stokes equations , the entropy four - current is decomposed as , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the heat flux , @xmath43 is the local rest frame entropy density and @xmath44 is the inverse temperature .",
    "these last two scalar quantities satisfy the fundamental relation of thermodynamics , @xmath45 , for matter with no conserved charge .",
    "hence , in 1st - order theories the only way to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics , using a linear relationship between the thermodynamic force and flux , is to choose , [ pins ] _ ns & & = - , + _ ns & & = - , [ pins ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are positive coefficients of shear and bulk viscosity respectively , while @xmath46 is the expansion scalar . the 1st - order theories ( contrary to 2nd - order theories ) are known to have intrinsic problems attributed to the immediate appearance and disappearance of the thermodynamic flux once the thermodynamic force is turned on or off . as shown by hiscock and lindblom",
    "@xcite the linearized version of these equations propagate perturbations acausally , and even though initially these might be weak signals they may grow unbounded bringing the system out of stable equilibrium .    to remedy some of these problems the 2nd - order theory of israel and stewart was constructed @xcite , similarly to the non - relativistic theory by mller @xcite .",
    "this was built around the assumption that the entropy four - current contains second order corrections in dissipation due to viscosity ( here we disregard heat conductivity and cross couplings ) such that , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are thermodynamic coefficients related to the relaxation times . applying the law of positive entropy production and",
    "some algebra leads to the transport equations for the shear and bulk pressure , [ relaxation_pi ] u^ _ & = & ( _ ns - ) , + u^ _ & = & ( _ ns - ) , [ relaxation_pi ] where the relaxation time of bulk viscosity and shear are , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the above equations are referred as the truncated israel - stewart equations , since terms involving the divergence of the flow field and thermodynamic coefficients have been neglected compared to the equations by israel and stewart @xcite .",
    "however , the current form of the transport equations already captures the essential features of relaxation phenomena which make the theory causal and stable .",
    "another crucial difference between first and second order theories is in the mathematical structure of the equations . in 1st - order theories the viscous corrections appear linearly proportional to the divergence of the flow field , therefore they are more sensitive to fluctuations and the inhomogeneities in the flow field , see section [ results ] . in 2nd - order theory not",
    "only the coefficients of viscosity but also the thermodynamic coefficients need to be specified .",
    "for example the later parameters are know for a relativistic boltzmann gas of massive particles @xcite , @xmath52 , leading to a relaxation time of , @xmath53 , which is divergent for a fluid of massless particles , while the bulk viscosity coefficient is zero in that limit .",
    "the thermodynamic coefficient for the shear viscosity within the same substance is , @xmath54 , leading to the relaxation time of , @xmath55 .    in passing we point out a few important facts regarding the bulk viscosity and its source .",
    "for a long time in the classical non - relativistic navier - stokes theory the purpose of bulk viscosity was controversial @xcite .",
    "even , eckart in his pioneering work @xcite was concerned with fluids without bulk viscosity .",
    "israel was the first to show that the bulk viscosity of relativistic matter may not be unimportant @xcite .",
    "this turned the attention mainly in cosmology , rendering bulk viscosity as the only possible form of dissipative phenomena , see for example @xcite and references therein for a thorough introduction .",
    "the bulk viscous effects are important in mixtures when the difference in property between the components becomes substantial",
    ". this might be due to the difference in cooling rates within the same type of substance or in a mixture between massive and effectively massless particles during a phase - transition @xcite , ( for other possible sources for bulk viscosity see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore in these situations bulk viscosity is used to describe a mixture effectively as a single fluid with a non - vanishing bulk viscosity coefficient and relaxation time .",
    "it is also important to phenomenologically understand the relation between viscosity and relaxation time @xcite .",
    "for example , bulk or volume viscosity appears when the system undergoes an isotropic expansion or contraction .",
    "if this happens at a relatively fast rate such that the system is unable to follow the change in volume and restore equilibrium in a short time , means that the relaxation time of the viscous pressure is long . on the opposite , if the system equilibrates almost immediately , than the corresponding relaxation time must be short .",
    "hence it is also intuitive that large deviations from equilibrium can only be the consequence of large viscosity , while small departures from equilibrium result from small viscosity , assuming in both cases that the expansion rate is considerably small .",
    "it is also fundamental that the relaxation time must be shorter than the inverse of the expansion rate of the system , @xmath56 , otherwise the system will never be able to equilibrate and the fluid dynamical approach is unsuitable .    in case of a relativistic boltzmann gas , recalling the viscosity coefficients from eqs .",
    "( [ pins],[pins ] ) , we find that the relaxation times are [ relax_time_pi ] _ & = & - ( ) , + _ & = & - ( ) , [ relax_time_pi ] where @xmath57 and we can only assume similarly to the relaxation time for the shear , that @xmath58 is a dimensionless positive number on the order of unity .",
    "this also follows from the fact that both viscosities give birth to a local dissipative pressure , which for small dissipative corrections relax to the navier - stokes values . in case",
    "the dissipative pressure is comparable to the equilibrium pressure , the relaxation times become longer than the mean free time between collisions , thus the fluid dynamical approach may no longer be appropriate .",
    "here we briefly review the basic principles of the underlying numerical scheme used in this work .",
    "the explicit finite difference scheme called sharp and smooth transport algorithm ( shasta ) @xcite is a version of the flux corrected transport ( fct ) algorithm .",
    "detailed tests , simulations and comparisons to semi - analytical solutions have been performed with this algorithm in various situations ; in non - relativistic and relativistic perfect fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics ; in the last decades @xcite achieving confidence and wide usage .    before discussing the version of the algorithm in detail ,",
    "let us rewrite the conservation equations ( [ cons_n02],[cons_e02],[cons_m02 ] ) and transport equations ( [ relaxation_pi],[relaxation_pi ] ) in conservation form which makes it possible to treat all equations with the same numerical scheme . due to similarity in form and effect in case of 1 + 1 dimensional expansion scenarios ,",

    "second order accuracy in time can only be calculated in @xmath81 time intervals ( if we use the time - split method ) , at time levels , @xmath82 , where the time derivatives are , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , etc .",
    "this ensures better accuracy , ( however , the difference is rather small ) , than calculating the time derivatives as well as the source terms at full time steps only , i.e. , only between time levels @xmath6 and @xmath80 .",
    "the difference of primary variables in adjacent cells is denoted by @xmath85 or later also by @xmath86 .",

    "a general requirement for any finite difference algorithm is to fulfill the so - called courant - friedrichs - lewy ( clf ) criterion , i.e. , @xmath88 , related to the stability of hyperbolic equations , otherwise the numerical solution becomes unconditionally unstable .",
    "physically this expresses that , matter must be causally propagated at most @xmath89 distance into vacuum . for shasta , @xmath90 , while in this paper we use a smaller value , @xmath91 .",
    "here we note that since the numerical algorithms average the transported quantities over a cell , part of the matter is acausally propagated over @xmath92 .",
    "this is a purely numerical artifact called prediffusion .",
    "the time - advanced quantities are calculated removing the numerical diffusion by subtracting the so - called antidiffusion fluxes , @xmath93 , from the transported and diffused quantities such that , u^n+1_j = _ j - _ j + _ j-1 .",
    "here we have defined the flux corrected antidiffusion flux [ antidiff ] _ j & = & _ j , where the phoenical antidiffusion flux , leads to somewhat smoother results . ]",
    "is , a_j & = & , + _ j & = & ( a_j ) .",
    "the so called mask , @xmath94 , is introduced to regulate the amount of anti - diffusion @xcite .",
    "the algorithm tends to produce small wiggles , due to the fact that in the antidiffusion step one removes to much diffusion , therefore adjusting the mask one can suppress this artifact leading to a more stable and smoother solutions .",
    "however the drawback is that , by reducing the antidiffusion we increase the numerical diffusion causing larger prediffusion and entropy production even in perfect fluids ! this step is unavoidable in numerical algorithms where due to discretization the differential equations are truncated already at leading order and without additional but purely numerical corrections lead to unstable solutions . within the numerical framework",
    "this is called numerical dissipation , or since it acts similarly to the physical viscosity it is also called artificial or numerical viscosity @xcite .    in case",
    "we want to model physical viscosity one has to keep in mind that the there is already a small numerical viscosity in the algorithm , which has to be estimated ( for example by measuring the entropy production in case of a perfect fluid ) and taken into account .",
    "this leads to a total effective viscosity which is larger than the one we explicitly include .",
    "obviously , things are not as simple , since the numerical viscosity and numerical diffusion contain linear and non - linear parts @xcite , and its effect strongly depends on the grid size , initial condition and flux limiters we use .",
    "therefore it is a question of numerical analysis and extensive testing to reveal the effect of numerical viscosity .",
    "some can be found in the original or related publications of the numerical schemes .",
    "it is important to remember that shasta is a low implicit viscosity algorithm , and conserves energy ( and momentum ) up to 5-digits , but produces entropy in the case of a perfect fluid roughly between @xmath95 , depending on the initial setup , antidiffuison flux , mask coefficient and physical situation .",
    "the lower value was found in the studies we are going to show in the next section using a mask of @xmath96 , while the error is less than @xmath97 using the standard value , @xmath98 , after 200 time - steps .",
    "the large entropy production was found in the case of a 3d grid with the same proportions , cell size , number of time - steps and reduced mask coefficient in case of 1 + 3 dimensional expansion into vacuum of an initially constant energy sphere .    to determine the bulk viscous pressure one also has to calculate the expansion scalar , @xmath99 .",
    "one possibility is to take the standard form , used in this work , using a second order accurate central difference formula , @xmath100 .",
    "the other form can be expressed from the conservation of energy , @xmath101 , or in case we also have conserved charge , from the continuity equation , @xmath102 , leading to , @xmath103 .",
    "the numerical differentiation of the velocity field introduces obvious numerical problems which we need to address .",
    "in particular , finite differences of the velocity field in adjacent cells , usually fluctuate due to numerical noise .",
    "since we solve a set of non - linear coupled partial differential equations , these may become uncontrollable . to make the numerical expansion rate smoother we found that an additional five - point stencil smoothing is necessary .",
    "however , the maximum number of neighboring cells to include is restricted by the courant number , otherwise we acausally propagate information into the neighboring cells . in our example the maximal number of these cells are two to the right and two to the left , hence the five - point stencil .    in the 1st- and 2nd - order theories the dissipative pressure , @xmath104 , must be smaller than the equilibrium pressure . if the correction to the equilibrium pressure is small , the system will continue to expand with a lower effective pressure but the overall behavior should not change considerably from the perfect fluid limit . however , at different parts of the system the local expansion rate may become very large ( for example , in the transition region to vacuum ) and generate large dissipative corrections .",
    "this threshold is given by the equilibrium pressure locally , at least in the 1st - order theory .",
    "hence , even though the physical situation may encounter larger values of the bulk pressure , we choose to keep this maximum .",
    "the upper bound imposed on the bulk pressure leads to an upper bound for the local expansion rate , @xmath105 .",
    "in other words , the navier - stokes bulk pressure is defined to be @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 . in the latter region the total pressure vanishes and the acceleration therefore stalls .",
    "we keep the above convention also for 2nd - order theory so that for very short relaxation times we exactly approach the navier - stokes limit .",
    "it is also important to mention that since we solve the relaxation equation in conservation form , the expansion rate appears explicitly in the truncated equations as well , similarly as in the full israel - stewart equations .",
    "hence it is obviously necessary to find an upper bound for terms containing the expansion rate otherwise those terms may grow unbounded and destabilize the solutions .",
    "in all numerical calculations , we have fixed the following parameters .",
    "the courant number , @xmath91 , and the cell size is @xmath110 fm , therefore @xmath111 fm / c .",
    "the grid contains 240 cells , while the total number of time steps is , @xmath112 , which corresponds to @xmath113 fm / c expansion time .",
    "the amount of anti - diffusion is reduced by @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath96 , which leads to some prediffusion but returns smoother profiles .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities are given by the stefan - boltzmann relations where the degeneracy of massless particles is @xmath115 . in case of dissipative fluids ,",
    "the bulk viscosity coefficient to entropy density is constant with values corresponding to small , @xmath116 , and to large , @xmath117 , ratios .    in most situations the initial expansion rate is unknown ,",
    "therefore the dissipative corrections are neglected at start .",
    "this may only last for one time - step , since after that the time - derivatives can already be calculated and dissipative corrections added . in particular cases such as the bjorken scaling solution , the expansion rate can be inferred from the geometry , therefore it does not pose a problem .",

    "we have checked the asymptotic limits of the relaxation equations . in case",
    "the relaxation time is small , @xmath119 , the effect of bulk viscosity is immediately felt by the system , therefore the system behaves as in case of 1st - order theories .",
    "for very large relaxation times , i.e. , larger than the lifetime of the system , and small initial dissipation , the effect of viscosity is exponentially suppressed and the solution approaches the perfect fluid limit .      in case of perfect fluids",
    "one of the analytical solutions which relates the thermodynamic properties of matter and the type of fluid dynamical solution is the 1 + 1 dimensional expansion into vacuum .",

    "we see that for 1st - order theory the velocity is fluctuating with an increasing frequency in time .",
    "initially the amplitude and the wavelength of the fluctuations is large , however as the expansion proceeds these large fluctuations are damped and become smaller amplitude and smaller wavelength oscillations .",
    "this is partially due to that , that the initial discontinuity smears out in time and the problem is resolved on a larger grid .",
    "however , the damping is also due to the non - linear antidiffusion term ( [ antidiff ] ) in the numerical algorithm . in other words",
    "this is numerical viscosity , which always acts to smooth the fluxes , contrary to the numerical dispersion which acts exactly the opposite and produces ripples in the results .",
    "it should also be obvious that working on a larger grid with the same cell size would not improve the results !    for bigger viscosity",
    "the numerical fluctuations become larger which is clearly a sign that the method fails and the numerical errors become uncontrollable .",
    "the results for 2nd - order theory are much smoother and show that there is a relevant change in the velocity profile , which is an outcome of the large dissipative pressure .",
    "this interesting phenomena appears near the edge of the matter where due to a large bulk pressure contribution the effective pressure essentially vanishes , therefore that part of the system stops to accelerate but due to inertia it keeps moving forward with constant speed , hence forming a constant velocity plateau . note that , the small wiggle in the velocity profile for large dissipation , visible for example on fig .",

    "we have plotted the effective pressure as a function of the similarity variable in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] , for both theories .",
    "one can see that for early times the expansion rate and therefore the bulk viscous pressure is largest . when the effective pressure drops ( to zero ) , the acceleration of matter is reduced ( the matter flows with constant velocity ) . however , the expansion rate will also decrease later , reducing the viscous pressure and",
    "therefore the velocity will continue to increase .",
    "the important thing to remember is that the speed of sound decreases due to dissipation and the effective rarefaction speed @xcite can be given as , @xmath137 .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that even though the bulk viscosity is large at places , the effective pressure ( and therefore the equilibrium pressure ) may be larger than in the case of perfect fluid , due to the fact the thermodynamic state of the system is influenced by entropy production and slower cooling .",
    "this is why the lab frame energy density decreases slower , see fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] .",
    "[ fig06 ] shows the temperature profile plotted at different time - steps for both theories .",
    "as in the case of velocity the presence of viscosity is observable in the overall reduced cooling of matter .",
    "the increase in the expansion rate increases the dissipation which in turn slows the expansion , thus the matter cools at a slower rate . on the other hand in 1st - order theories ,",
    "the visibility of this effect is much more reduced due to numerical problems .",
    "the laboratory frame energy density normalized to the initial pressure is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] .",
    "since this quantity is proportional to the fourth root of the temperature divided by the initial temperature , it is much less affected by the fluctuations and prediffusion in both cases .",
    "based on the previous arguments the deviation from the es - pf are noticeable for larger values of the similarity variable , where the effect of dissipation is most pronounced .",
    "this plot also confirms that the effective pressure drops to zero , however since the matter has a finite energy density , temperature , and velocity , the laboratory energy density is not zero at those places .",
    "as soon as the expansion rate decreases , the finite albeit small effective pressure will continue to expand the matter into vacuum .",
    "further comparisons between the 1st - order and 2nd - order theories can be found in the appendix .      to further investigate the behavior of matter with large viscosity we have used a relatively soft eos , where the speed of sound squared is @xmath138 , while keeping the other parameters intact .",
    "using a soft equation of state reduces the pressure and the pressure gradients in the system , while the relaxation time increases , @xmath139 , inversely with local speed of sound and temperature .",
    "[ fig08]a shows the velocity profile for 1st - order theory while fig .",
    "[ fig08]b for 2nd - order theory , both in case of a soft eos . in comparison to fig . [ fig03 ] ,",
    "the velocity profiles are much improved and the constant velocity part of velocity profile is clearly visible even from the 1st - order theory .",
    "it is clear that the algorithm works much better , producing overall smooth results .",
    "we have also checked our algorithm with a hard eos , @xmath140 , which proved that overshoots and oscillations become enhanced compared to the standard case ( @xmath141 ) and the results became less reliable .",
    "[ fig09 ] , shows the effective pressure normalized by the initial pressure , similar to fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] , but with a soft eos .",
    "once again the results are good , especially in the case of 2nd - order theory .",
    "this is due to fact that a softer eos not only reduces the thermodynamic pressure compared to the standard eos but also decreases the dissipative pressure .",
    "it is also important to understand that in this case the dissipative effects act on an overall wider scale as function of @xmath142 , but even though the effect of dissipation is immediately added , the results are much smoother because the dissipative pressure is also reduced .",
    "a interesting and relevant question to study , is the expansion of dissipative matter with a temperature dependent bulk viscosity . to model this property",
    ", we assumed that bulk viscosity acts in the close vicinity of a specific or critical temperature , @xmath143 , otherwise it is zero .",
    "thus the bulk viscosity coefficient is , = _ 0 ( t - 1.02 t_c ) ( 1 - ( t - 0.98t_c ) ) . here",
    "the choice of critical temperature is , @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the initial temperature , and @xmath146 is the bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "the calculations are done for 2nd order theory including the above temperature dependent bulk viscosity .    figs .",
    "[ fig10]a and [ fig10]b shows the velocity of the matter and the expansion rate as a function of the similarity variable . for the same setup , in figs . [ fig11]a and [ fig11]b the temperature normalized by the initial temperature and the laboratory frame energy density normalized by the initial pressure is shown .",
    "when the temperature falls in the respective regime , the viscosity over entropy ratio rises suddenly , to @xmath147 , while otherwise the dissipation is switched off . in our case",
    "this manifests itself as almost constant velocity temperature , pressure , and energy density plateau , located roughly between @xmath148 .",
    "because the effective pressure decreased suddenly , the matter is slowed down considerably , until the matter cools below the predefined temperature ( although much slower ) , then the system will suddenly find local thermal equilibrium and continue to accelerate .",
    "this is apparent in all plots .",
    "this type of studies may be relevant in case of a phase - transitions where the temperature dependent viscosity modeling becomes necessary @xcite .",
    "in this section we test how well the numerical calculations reproduce one - dimensional dissipative scaling flow .",
    "the relaxation time was kept constant , @xmath149  fm / c , which does not effect the final outcome qualitatively .",
    "we first recall the 1 + 1 dimensional bjorken scaling solution for perfect @xcite and dissipative fluids @xcite .",
    "the equations follow from the conservation law @xmath150 , and the second law of thermodynamics , under the assumption that the matter expands longitudinally with a flow velocity @xmath151 in a boost invariant manner . to transform the partial differential equations into simple differential equations ( using the assumption of boost invariance ) ,",
    "one carries out a coordinate transformation from @xmath152 to @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the proper time and @xmath155 $ ] is the space - time rapidity .",
    "therefore , the truncated israel - stewart equations for the energy and bulk pressure are , [ e_bj ] & = & -(e + p + ) , [ e_bj ] + & = & ( _ ns - ) , [ pi_bj ] where @xmath156 , and the effective pressure satisfies , @xmath157 . the equations of perfect fluid dynamics are obtained when the dissipative bulk pressure is zero , @xmath158 .",
    "the relativistic navier - stokes equation is given by eq .",
    "( [ e_bj ] ) alone , since bulk pressure @xmath159 is given algebraically .",
    "in the bjorken picture the system is infinitely elongated in rapidity .",
    "since our shasta code is written in standard space - time coordinates @xmath152 , we have to determine initial values on a @xmath160 surface and the fluid must have a finite length ( due to the finite grid ) , @xmath161 .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "we first solve eqs .",
    "( [ e_bj],[pi_bj ] ) using a 4th - order runge - kutta solver for all times @xmath162  fm / c .",
    "together with the assumption of boost invariance , this determines the hydrodynamic fields in the entire forward light - cone .",
    "we then repeat the solution with the shasta partial differential equation solver with initial conditions at @xmath163  fm set by the runge - kutta solution .",
    "we note that in the shasta solution the system has a boundary since the velocity at @xmath164 is close to but slightly less than the velocity of light ( @xmath164 is smaller than @xmath165 by one grid spacing ) .    in the 1st - order theory",
    "the initial value for the bulk pressure is @xmath166 , which can be limited by the equilibrium pressure , i.e. , the dissipative pressure should not be larger than the initial equilibrium pressure otherwise the system becomes unstable . in the 2nd - order theory , we take the initial value of the bulk pressure to be the same as in the 1st - order theory . using this initial condition allows for a direct comparison since both theories start from the same initial values .",
    "moreover , on physical grounds , if @xmath167 is to be interpreted as the onset of hydrodynamic behavior ( thermalization time ) than the reynolds number at @xmath167 should be stationary , i.e. , it should neither grow nor decrease ; this implies that the initial value for the bulk pressure should be close to that given by the 1st - order approach  @xcite .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] that the flow velocity and expansion rate are fairly well reproduced for the 2nd - order theory while the results for the 1st - order theory show large numerical artifacts already at a few fm distance from the center .",
    "this is correlated with the coarse graining since the results improve on finer grids .",
    "we can also observe the large prediffusion into vacuum due to reduced antidiffusion similarly to the riemann wave discussed above .",
    "the fluctuations in the velocity are also visible in the expansion rate and in the pressure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .    we have also tested how well the algorithm solves the relaxation equation for the bulk pressure .",
    "this is important to know , since the shasta was specially designed to solve conservation equations .",
    "we have plotted the evolution of the bulk pressure in the central cell , which has a velocity @xmath168 , next to the results of a standard fourth - order runge - kutta solver .",
    "the comparison in case of 1st - order theory is given in fig .",
    "[ fig14]a . here",
    "@xmath169 with full line is the runge - kutta solver , while the result of shasta is @xmath170 , with dashed line .",
    "the curves match reasonably well , deviations are due to the overestimate of the local expansion rate .    for 2nd - order theories our standard choice for the initial value of the bulk pressure is given by the navier - stokes value ; this corresponds to @xmath171 and @xmath172 in fig .",
    "[ fig14]b .",
    "we have also compared to the case when the system starts from equilibrium ( @xmath173 ) , see the curves @xmath174 and @xmath175 . in both cases",
    "the shasta result is very good .",
    "there are some small deviations , however , this is due to the difference between the calculated and analytical expansion rates .",
    "we have checked our calculations using the exact expansion rate @xmath176 and in this case not only the 2nd - order calculations but also the 1st - order ones are smooth and very accurately match the runge - kutta results .",
    "in this work we have focused on testing numerical solutions of first and second order theories of relativistic hydrodynamics with bulk viscosity using the shasta flux corrected transport algorithm .",
    "this is a rather efficient and fast algorithm for solving causal fluid transport on a fixed grid ; it provides accurate solutions of ideal hydrodynamics with minimal numerical viscosity and prediffusion and can be easily adapted to multi - dimensional problems .",
    "in fact , the algorithm can also be used to solve the relaxation equations of the 2nd - order approach simultaneously with the conservation equations without resorting to other numerical schemes , which may reduce the computational time and complicate the problem and its implementation further .",
    "the 1st - order theory of viscous hydrodynamics provides the proper description of long - wavelength , low - frequency density waves in a fluid .",
    "the 2nd - order theory introduces relaxation equations for the dissipative fluxes thereby maintaining causality .",
    "its solutions converge to those of the 1st - order theory over time scales larger than the relaxation times .",
    "it has been argued that these relaxation times might be on the order of the microscopic time scales in the problem and that the 2nd - order theory is therefore no better approximation to the dynamics than the 1-st order approach .",
    "our numerical solutions with the shasta algorithm , however , indicate that the accuracy and stability of the solutions of the 2nd - order theory is significantly better than in the 1st - order theory , even if the calculated local expansion rate is smoothed over a few fluid cells : the solution of the riemann wave with viscosity in the 1st - order approach produces oscillations which are absent from the 2nd - order theory .",
    "this observation holds for virtually any amount of dissipation . also , the numerical problems encountered in the 1st - order approach get milder if the speed of sound is smaller ( which reduces the acceleration of the flow ) but worse if the equation of state is stiff .",
    "these observations are valid in 2 or 3 dimensional cases @xcite , therefore in conclusion , we believe that for general purpose codes the 2nd order theory is not only more general , but also more stable and reliable even numerically . although using the 2nd - order theory it is computationally more intensive since the dissipative quantities have to be propagated in time , its implementation into some existing numerical codes which solve hyperbolic partial differential equations in conservation form , does not require more effort than adding the 1st - order corrections .",
    "regardless on the difference between numerical methods , using the same initial conditions and corresponding physical quantities , all numerical results should be very closely the same .",
    "unfortunately , in case of dissipative fluid dynamics there are only a few simple solutions where the numerical accuracy can be tested in great detail . however , taking into account that actual applications of relativistic fluid dynamics in modeling relativistic heavy - ion collisions need several other crucial approximations , ( introducing additional uncertainties and parameters linked to the fluid dynamical calculation , such as initial conditions and freeze - out ) , it is of great importance that the numerical fluid dynamical methods should be very carefully investigated , tested and documented in various situations . to our knowledge , in most publications",
    "this topic is rather forgotten and/or undisclosed .",
    "the other reliable possibility and recommendation would be to check the fluid dynamical codes against kinetic theory @xcite , which on the other hand would also validate transport codes in the fluid dynamical regime .",
    "note added : during the preparation of this manuscript we became aware of the very recent work by the brazilian group @xcite , on the shock propagation and stability in causal 1 + 1 dimensional dissipative hydrodynamics , using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "this important problem was also investigated by us with the relaxation method presented in this paper , and lead to very promising agreement with kinetic theory @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the author is thankful to d. h. rischke for the original version of ideal shasta code and many important comments and suggestions .",
    "the author also thanks to h. niemi for checking independently some results presented and for his clarifying comments and recommendations .",

    "e.  m. , gratefully acknowledges support by the alexander von humboldt foundation .",
    "here we approximately extract and quantify the numerical errors and uncertainties as a function of time and viscosity .",
    "since the exact solution for the riemann problem with dissipation is unknown , the deviation from analytic solutions can not be measured .",
    "however , since the 2nd order solutions converge to the 1st - order solutions at late times , we may quantify the error and deviations between the outcomes .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following relative deviation ( point by point ) between the flow velocities of matter and measure it by the following integral , [ deviation ] d(t ) = ^1.5_-1 d |v_2nd ( ) - v_1st ( ) | , where the normalization factor , @xmath177 .",
    "note that , the 1st - order and 2nd - order theories start from different initial values , hence the initial deviation .",
    "we also observe that increasing the viscosity the results start to diverge at late times , signaling the instability and large errors in the numerical solution of the 1st - order theory .",
    "this was apparent in all figures in sect .",
    "[ sl_diss ] .",
    "next we discuss and show further examples and test results using different initial conditions and antidiffusion mask coefficients . using the purely conventional initial value for the velocity of vacuum , @xmath178 for @xmath124 ,",
    "we make sure that the fluid dynamical solution is continuous at the boundary to vacuum .",
    "this specific test ensures that the oscillations in the 1-st order theory are not caused by the sharp boundary and that the oscillations propagate outwards and not inwards from the vacuum , see fig .",
    "[ fig16]a .",
    "therefore , this effect is mainly due to two things .",
    "first the higher order derivatives of the flow velocity appear in the equations and therefore even very small fluctuations in the flow field are enhanced and couple back into the solution .",
    "the second is a purely numerical problem which unfortunately affects of the numerical scheme and its accuracy since the shasta algorithm was not explicitly designed to solve the relativistic navier - stokes equations .",
    "we also see the effect of a further numerical artifact namely reducing the antidiffusion coefficient by @xmath179 and @xmath180 not only increases the entropy in the system , but also gives result to non - linear changes and differences in the solutions .",
    "the standard version of the algorithm uses a mask coefficient equal to 1 .",
    "we can see in figs .",
    "[ fig16 ] and [ fig17]b that using a @xmath114 smaller mask is reasonably close to the solution with the standard value of the mask , but more importantly the results become much smoother .    in fig .",
    "[ fig17]a we have plotted the velocity profile calculated with a @xmath114 reduced antidiffusion for a smoothed and un - smoothed expansion rate .",
    "we can see that the smoothing affects the solution positively leading to even less prediffusion into vacuum in this particular case .",
    "here we recall the solutions for the expansion into vacuum in case of a perfect fluid following @xcite . introducing the similarity variable , @xmath181 ,",
    "the partial derivatives transform as , @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",

    "the correct solutions implies eq .",
    "( [ simvariable ] ) , hence we are lead to the following trivial equation , = - , which with the corresponding initial conditions given in sect .",
    "[ riemann ] leads to the results presented before .",

    "the relaxation equation is , ( v - ) - ( 1 - v ) ^3 = - , while the derivative of the pressure reduces to , @xmath192 . in conclusion",
