    "this article is based on a covariant causal set approach to discrete quantum gravity @xcite . for background and more details , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we call a finite partially ordered set a _ causet _ and interpret the order @xmath4 in a causet @xmath1 to mean that @xmath5 is in the causal future of @xmath6 .",
    "we denote the cardinality of a causet @xmath1 by @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath8 are causets with @xmath9 then @xmath1 _ produces _ @xmath8 ( written @xmath10 ) if @xmath8 is obtained from @xmath1 by adjoining a single maximal element @xmath6 to @xmath1 . if @xmath10 we call @xmath8 an _ offspring _ of @xmath1 .",
    "a _ labeling _ for a causet @xmath1 is a bijection @xmath11 such that @xmath12 with @xmath4 implies that @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 is labeling for @xmath1 , we call @xmath15 an @xmath14-_causet_. two @xmath14-causets @xmath1 and @xmath8 are _ isomorphic _ if there exists a bijection @xmath16 such that @xmath4 in @xmath1 if and only if @xmath17 in @xmath8 and @xmath18}=\\ell ( a)$ ] for every @xmath19 .",
    "isomorphic @xmath14-causets are considered identical as @xmath14-causets .",
    "we say that a causet is _ covariant _ if it has a unique labeling ( up to @xmath14-causet isomorphism ) and call a covariant causet a @xmath0-_causet_. we denote the set of a @xmath0-causets with cardinality @xmath20 by @xmath21 and the set of all @xmath0-causets by @xmath22 .",
    "it is easy to show that any @xmath23 with @xmath24 has a unique producer and that any @xmath23 has precisely two offspring @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "two elements @xmath12 are _ comparable _ if @xmath4 or @xmath27 .",
    "we say that @xmath6 is a _ parent _ of @xmath5 and @xmath5 is a _ child _ of @xmath6 if @xmath4 and there is no @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "path from _",
    "@xmath6 _ to _ @xmath5 in @xmath1 is a sequence @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a parent of @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the _ height _",
    "@xmath36 of @xmath19 is the cardinality minus one of the longest path in @xmath1 that ends with @xmath6 . if there are no such paths , then @xmath37 by convention .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a causet @xmath1 is covariant if and only if @xmath12 are comparable whenever @xmath6 and @xmath5 have different heights . if @xmath23 we call the sets @xmath38 _ shells _ and the sequence of integers @xmath39 , @xmath3 , is the _ shell sequence_. a @xmath0-causet is uniquely determined by its shell sequence and we think of @xmath2 as describing the `` shape '' or geometry of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the tree @xmath40 can be thought of as a growth model and an @xmath41 is a possible universe among many universes at step ( time ) @xmath20 .",
    "an instantaneous universe @xmath41 grows one element at a time in one of two ways . to be specific , if @xmath41 has shell sequence @xmath42 , then @xmath1 will grow to one of its two offspring @xmath43 , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 have shell sequences @xmath47 respectively .    in the microscopic picture , we view a @xmath0-causet @xmath1 as a framework or scaffolding for a possible universe .",
    "the vertices of @xmath1 represent small cells that can be empty or occupied by a particle .",
    "the shell sequence that determines @xmath1 gives the geometry of the framework .",
    "a labeling of @xmath1 gives a `` birth order '' for the elements of @xmath1 and since @xmath1 is covariant , its structure is independent of birth order .",
    "in the previous section , @xmath0-causets were employed to describe possible universes within a multiverse . in the growth model",
    "@xmath48 a universe grew one element at each time step which created a history for a possible evolved universe .",
    "each history began with one vertex and its early stages contained only a few vertices .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that those early stages were inhabited by various elementary particles.we therefore propose that an elementary particle is described by a small @xmath0-causet . in this section , instead of thinking of a causet as a possible instantaneous universe , we will think of it as an elementary particle .",
    "a _ link _ in a @xmath0-causet @xmath1 is a set @xmath49 where @xmath6 is a parent of @xmath5 ( order is immaterial ) .",
    "a @xmath0-causet @xmath1 together with its links can be thought of as a graph .",
    "a _ graph path _ from vertex @xmath0 to vertex @xmath50 in @xmath1 is a sequence of distinct incident links @xmath51 .",
    "a @xmath0-causet @xmath1 is 2-_connected _ if for any two comparable vertices @xmath52 of @xmath1 there exist at least two disjoint graph paths from @xmath6 to @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath19 with @xmath1 a @xmath0-causet , then the pairs @xmath53 are called _",
    "preons_. we think of a preon as an indivisible particle with electric charge @xmath54 , @xmath55 or @xmath56 . a @xmath0-causet is _ occupied _ if each of its vertices is replaced by a preon",
    ". we will classify certain occupied @xmath0-causets as elementary particles . for",
    "such @xmath0-causets the vertices will represent preons and the edges ( links ) will represent forces between pairs of preons .",
    "a photon is represented by an occupied @xmath0-causet having an even number of vertices with shell sequence @xmath57 and the preons are alternatively charged @xmath58 .",
    "the reason a photon has this form is that a photon should move along a geodesic in its containing universe and we have seen in a previous study that geodesics have this structure @xcite .",
    "we consider a photon to be an elementary particle .",
    "the other elementary particles will be represented by certain occupied 2-connected @xmath0-causets .",
    "these elementary particles and their combinations will correspond to matter - energy . occupied @xmath0-causets that are not 2-connected ( 2-disconnected ) correspond to dark matter - energy .",
    "the following table lists the number of @xmath0-causets with @xmath20 vertices that are 2-connected and 2-disconnected , @xmath59 .",
    "this indicates that dark matter - energy dominates over matter - energy . in this article",
    "we only consider matter - energy ; specifically , elementary particles and their combinations . .25 in    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we now classify the elementary particles according to their representative occupied @xmath0-causets .",
    "this is mainly guesswork but we present some evidence for this scheme . except for photons",
    ", we postulate that because elementary particles are forms of matter - energy , they are described by 2-connected @xmath0-causets .",
    "the reason for this is that 2-connected @xmath0-causets have multiple graph paths so there are strong connections between their preons .",
    "this enables them to stay together and be more stable .",
    "photons are the exception but their preons are charged so they have electromagnetic attraction while the preons of dark matter - energy presumably are electrically neutral .",
    "we see from table  1 that there are no 2-connected @xmath0-causets with less than four vertices .",
    "the only 2-connected @xmath0-causets with four vertices are the @xmath0-causets with shell sequences @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we postulate that the first corresponds to the electron @xmath62 and the second to the up quark @xmath63 .",
    "these are illustrated in figure  1 .        in figure  1 , the vertices are preons with the labeled charges . of course , the positron @xmath64 and the up anti - quark @xmath65 are like @xmath62 and @xmath63 except the preon charges are reversed . also , the electron neutrino @xmath66 is like the electron except the preon charges are zero .",
    "we propose that in the next generations , the muon and tauon leptons have the shell sequences @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the preons in @xmath69 and @xmath70 have charges that give the correct total charge of @xmath71 . as with @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "these charges are not uniquely distributed .",
    "as before , we define the antiparticles @xmath72 , @xmath73 to be the same as @xmath69 , @xmath74 with the preon charges reversed and the neutrinos @xmath75 , @xmath76 to be the same as @xmath69 , @xmath70 with preon charges 0 .",
    "finally , we define the quarks @xmath77 as having the shell sequences , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the preon charges are distributed to give the usual total charges @xmath56 , @xmath56 , @xmath83 , @xmath56 , @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the antiquarks @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 again have reverse preon charges .",
    "this completes our list of elementary particles .",
    "we shall not consider the higg s boson and the weak and strong force mediating bosons here .",
    "the mesons are formed as usual from quark - antiquark pairs and the baryons are formed from quark triplets .",
    "these will be considered in the next section .",
    "a vertex of a @xmath0-causet is _ lonesome _ if it is the only vertex in its shell in @xmath1 .",
    "for example , @xmath62 has shell sequence @xmath60 so @xmath62 has two lonesome vertices . in general , @xmath1 contains lonesome vertices if and only if @xmath1 has at least one 1 in its shell sequence . as another example",
    ", the up quark @xmath63 with shell sequence @xmath61 has no lonesome vertices .",
    "we say that a link is _ weak _ if at least one of its two vertices is lonesome .",
    "otherwise , a link is _",
    "strong_. we associate a weak link with the weak force and a strong link with the strong force .",
    "notice that a photon has only weak links .",
    "since photons mediate the electromagnetic force , we see that this force is described by a sequence of an even number of weak links . in a sense , this gives a unification of these three forces of nature .",
    "finally , the links are equivalent to the causal order which determines the geometry of @xmath0-causets .",
    "as we have described in @xcite , this geometry is responsible for the force of gravity . continuing this analysis",
    ", we see that all the leptons @xmath62 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , their antiparticles and associated neutrinos all contain weak links . except for @xmath62 , @xmath64 , @xmath66",
    "they also contain strong links .",
    "moreover , all the quarks have only strong links .",
    "we now present a mass formula for the elementary particles and their compositions . recalling that the @xmath20th bohr orbit has energy proportional to @xmath89",
    ", we postulate that the part of the mass of a preon in the @xmath20th shell due to the weak force is also proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "we next postulate that the part of the mass of a preon in the @xmath20th shell due to the strong force is proportional to @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , we assume that even if a particle has only strong links there are weak forces involved . to be precise , we make the following postulate where masses are in mev .",
    "* mass formula postulate * : let @xmath91 be a lepton , quark or hadron with shell sequence @xmath92 .",
    "if @xmath91 has only weak links the _ weak - strong mass _ of @xmath91 is @xmath93 and if @xmath91 has strong links the _ weak - strong mass _ of @xmath91 is @xmath94    of course , we do not expect @xmath95 to give the exact experimental mass because the electromagnetic force is not included . also , this formula is unit dependent and we might get a little better agreement with experiment if we change the @xmath96 factor slightly and multiply the first summation term in by a factor close to one .",
    "we now apply the mass formula to the leptons and quarks .",
    "since the electron has shell sequence @xmath60 we have @xmath97 where we have placed the experimental value in parenthesis . since the muon has shell sequence @xmath98 we have @xmath99 the tauon has shell sequence @xmath100 which gives @xmath101 for quarks",
    "we have @xmath102 we do not compare these to experimental values because isolated quarks have not been found so such values are not clear ..    we now consider some mesons . until a more complete theory is established we are only guided by their quark constituency and their masses .",
    "the @xmath103-meson is composed of a @xmath104 pair so we assume it has the nine vertices of @xmath63 and @xmath84 distributed in some order .",
    "we propose that @xmath103 has the shell sequence @xmath105 .",
    "this gives @xmath106 we propose that the @xmath107-meson has the shell sequence @xmath108 which gives @xmath109 we assume that the @xmath110-meson has shell sequence @xmath111 which gives @xmath112 finally , the @xmath113-meson is composed of an @xmath114 pair so it has 12 vertices and we assume it has shell sequence @xmath115 which gives @xmath116    we next consider some baryons .",
    "the neutron @xmath117 is a @xmath118 quark triple so we assume that @xmath117 has the 14 vertices of @xmath119 distributed in some order .",
    "we propose that @xmath117 has the shell sequence @xmath120 .",
    "this gives @xmath121 the proton @xmath122 is a @xmath123 quark triple which gives 13 vertices and we assume its shell sequence is @xmath124 .",
    "this gives @xmath125 the @xmath126-baryon is a @xmath127 quark triple with 16 vertices and we assume its shell sequence is @xmath128 .",
    "this gives @xmath129 the @xmath130-baryon is a @xmath131 quark triple with 17 vertices and we assume its shell sequence is @xmath132 .",
    "this gives @xmath133 the @xmath134-baryon is a @xmath135 quark triple with 12 vertices and we assume its shell sequence is @xmath136 .",
    "this gives @xmath137 the @xmath138-baryon is a @xmath139 quark triple with 15 vertices and we assume its shell sequence is @xmath140 .",
    "this gives @xmath141 finally , @xmath142 is an @xmath143 quark triple with 18 vertices and we assume its shell sequence is @xmath144 .",
    "this gives @xmath145    the author admits that this is fairly arbitrary and that one can get practically any mass he / she wants by manipulating the shell sequence .",
    "nevertheless , it is somewhat striking that the above examples give masses so close to the experimental values .",
    "moreover , there is a hint of a pattern in these baryon shell sequences .",
    "notice that if there is no @xmath146 quark , then the last two shell numbers add to 6 , if there is one @xmath146 quark , they add to 7 or 8 , if there are two @xmath146 quarks , they add to 9 and if there are 3 @xmath146 quarks , they add to 11 .",
    "it is hoped that a strengthening of this theory will point directly to the shell sequence of various particles .",
    "we can also continue this investigation by studying atoms .",
    "for example , a hydrogen atom should be represented by a proton with the photon - electron `` kite '' of figure  2 attached to one of its highest shell preons .",
