    "several biological functions are triggered by mechanical force . these include stretching and contraction of muscle proteins such as titin @xcite , rolling and tethering of cell adhesion molecules @xcite , translocation of proteins across membranes @xcite , and unfoldase activity of chaperonins and proteasomes .",
    "understanding these diverse functions requires probing the response of biomolecules to applied external tension .",
    "dynamical responses to mechanical force can be used to characterize in detail the free energy landscape of biomolecules .",
    "advances in manipulating micron - sized beads attached to single biomolecules have made it possible to stretch , twist , unfold and even unbind proteins using forces on the order of tens of piconewtons @xcite .",
    "single molecule force spectroscopy on a number of different systems has allowed us to obtain a glimpse of the unbinding energy landscape of biomolecules and protein - protein complexes @xcite . in afm experiments ,",
    "used to unfold proteins by force , one end of a protein is adsorbed on a template and a constant or a time - dependent pulling force is applied to the other terminus @xcite . by measuring the distribution of forces required to completely unfold proteins and the associated unfolding times , the global parameters of the protein energy landscape can be estimated @xcite .",
    "these insightful experiments when combined with theoretical studies @xcite can give an unprecedented picture of forced - unfolding pathways .",
    "current experiments have been designed primarily to obtain information on forced - unfolding of proteins and do not probe the reverse folding process .",
    "although force - clamp afm techniques have been used recently to probe ( re)folding of single ubiquitin polyprotein @xcite , the lack of theoretical approaches has made it difficult to interpret these pioneering experiments @xcite .",
    "secondly , the resolution of multiple timescales in protein folding and refolding requires not only novel experimental tools for single molecule experiments but also new theoretical analysis methods .",
    "minimally , unfolding of proteins by a stretching force @xmath1 is described by the global unfolding time @xmath11 , timescales for propagation of the applied tension , and the dynamics describing the intermediates or `` protein coil '' states . finally , if the external conditions ( loading rate or the magnitude of @xmath1 ) are such that these processes can occur on similar timescales then the analysis of the data requires new theoretical ideas .    for forced unfolding the variable conjugate to @xmath1 , namely , the protein end - to - end distance @xmath12 is a natural reaction coordinate .",
    "however , @xmath12 is not appropriate for describing protein refolding which , due to substantial variations in the duration of folding barrier crossing , may range from milliseconds to few minutes . to obtain statistically _ meaningful _ distributions of unfolding times , a large number of _ complete _ unfolding trajectories must be recorded which requires repeated application of the pulling force .",
    "the inherent heterogeneity in the duration of folding and the lack of correlation between evolution of @xmath12 and ( re)folding progress creates `` initial state ambiguity '' when force is repeatedly applied to the same molecule . as a result ,",
    "the interpretation of unfolding time data is complicated especially when the conditions are such that reverse folding process at the quenched force @xmath4 can occur on a long timescale , @xmath13 .",
    "motivated by the need to assess the effect of the multiple timescales on the energy landscape of folding and unfolding , we develop a new theoretical formalism to describe correlations between the various dynamical processes .",
    "our theory leads naturally to a new class of single molecule force experiments , namely , the force correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) which can be used to study both forced unfolding as well as force - quenched ( re)folding . such studies can lead to a more detailed information on both kinetic and dynamic events underlying unfolding and refolding . in the fcs ,",
    "cycles of stretching ( @xmath1 ) are separated by periods @xmath3 of quenched force @xmath4@xmath5@xmath1 during which the stretched protein can relax from its unfolded state @xmath14 to coil state @xmath15 or even ( re)fold to the native basin of attraction ( nba ) state .",
    "the two experimental observables are @xmath12 and the unfolding time @xmath16 .",
    "the central quantity in the fcs is the distribution of unfolding times @xmath2 separated by recoil or refolding events of duration @xmath3 .",
    "the higher order statistical measure embedded in @xmath2 is readily accessible by constructing a histogram of unfolding times for varying @xmath3 and does not require additional technical developments .",
    "the crucial element in the proposed analysis is that @xmath2 is computed by _ averaging over final ( unfolded ) states _ , rather than initial ( folded ) states .",
    "this procedure removes the potential ambiguity of not precisely knowing the initial distribution of conformations in the nba . despite the uniqueness of the native state",
    "there are a number of conformations in the nba that reflect the fluctuations of the folded state .",
    "the proposed formalism is a natural extension of unbinding time data analysis .",
    "indeed , @xmath2 reduces to the standard distribution of unfolding times @xmath0 when @xmath3 exceeds protein ( re)folding timescale @xmath13 .",
    "the complexity of the energy ladscape of proteins demands fcs and the theoretical analysis .",
    "current single molecule experiments on poly - ub or poly - ig27 ( performed in the @xmath3@xmath17@xmath18 regime ) show that in these systems unfolding occurs abruptly in an apparent all - or - none manner or through a dominant intermediate @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "refolding upon force - quench is complex and surely occurs though an ensemble of collapsed coiled states @xcite .",
    "a number of timescales characterize the stretch - release experiments . these include besides @xmath13 , the @xmath1-dependent unfolding time , and the relaxation dynamics in the coiled states @xmath19 upon force - quench @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , if we assume that @xmath12 is an appropriate reaction coordinate then the location of the nba , @xmath19 , the transition state ensembles and the associated widths are required for a complete characterization of the underlying energy landscape .",
    "most of these parameters can be extracted using the proposed fcs experiments and the theoretical analysis presented here .    in a preliminary study @xcite",
    ", we reported the basics of the theory which was used to propose a new class of single molecule force spectroscopy methods for deciphering protein - protein interactions .",
    "the current paper is devoted to further developments in the theory with appplication to forced - unfolding and force - quench refolding of proteins .",
    "in particular , we illustrate the efficacy of the fcs by analyzing single unfolding - refolding trajectories generated for a coarse - grained model ( cgm ) protein @xmath7 with @xmath8-sheet architecture @xcite .",
    "we showed previously that forced - unraveling of @xmath7 , in the limit of @xmath3@xmath17@xmath18 , can be described by an apparent `` two - state ''",
    "kinetics @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics and kinetics observed in @xmath7 is a characteristic of a number of proteins where folding / unfolding fits well two - state behavior @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath7 serves as a useful model to illustrate the efficacy of the fcs . here",
    ", we show that by varying @xmath3 and the magnitude of the stretching ( @xmath1 or @xmath4 ) , the entire dynamical processes , starting from the nba to the fully stretched state , can be resolved . in the process",
    "we establish that @xmath2 which can be measured using afm or laser optical tweezer ( lot ) experiments , provides a convenient way of characterizing the energy landscape of biomolecules in detail .",
    "_ theory of force correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) : _ in single molecule atomic force microscopy ( afm ) experiments used to unfold proteins by force , the n - terminus of a protein is anchored at the surface and the c - terminus is attached to the cantilever tip through a polymer linker ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the molecule is stretched by displacing the cantilever tip and the resulting force is measured . from a theoretical perspective",
    "it is more convenient to envision applying a constant stretching force @xmath1@xmath9@xmath21@xmath22 in the @xmath22-direction ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the free energy in the constant force formulation is related to the experimental setup by a legendre transformation .",
    "more recently , it has become possible to apply a constant force in afm or laser or optical tweezer ( lot ) experiments to the ends of a protein . with this setup the unfolding time for the end - to - end distance @xmath12 to reach the contour length @xmath23",
    "can be measured for each molecule . for a fixed @xmath1 , repeated application of the pulling force results in a single trajectory of unfolding times ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , figure 1 ) from which the histogram of unfolding times @xmath0 is obtained .",

    "even when the transition from the folded state @xmath35 to the globally extended state @xmath36 @xcite does not involve parallel routes as in figure 2 , or multistate kinetics , the force - induced unfolding pathway must involve formation of intermediate coiled states @xmath19 . the subsequent transition from @xmath19 results in the formation of the globally unfolded state @xmath36 .",
    "the incomplete time resolution prevents current experiments from probing the signature of the collapsed states . to probe the contributions from the underlying @xmath19 states to global unfolding requires sophisticated experiments that can resolve contributions from dynamic events underlying forced unfolding .",
    "we propose a novel experimental procedure which , when supplemented with unfolding time data analysis described below , allows us to separately probe the kinetics of native interactions and the dynamics of the `` protein coil '' ( i.e. the dynamics of end - to - end distance @xmath12 when the native contacts are disrupted ) .",

    "in the current experiments @xmath3@xmath17@xmath18 . as a result , the dynamics of additional states in the energy landscape that are explored during folding or unfolding are not probed .",
    "the advantages of @xmath2 over the standard distribution of unfolding times @xmath0 are two - fold .",
    "first , @xmath2 is computed by _ averaging over well - characterized fully stretched states_. this eliminates the problem of not knowing the distribution of initial protein states encountered in current experiments . indeed ,",
    "due to intrinsic heterogeneity of the protein folding pathways , after the first unfolding event the protein may or may not refold into the native conformation , which creates the initial state ambiguity in the next ( second , third , etc ) pulling cycle .",
    "therefore , statistical analysis based on averaging over final ( stretched ) states rather than initial ( folded ) states allows to overcome this difficulty .",
    "secondly , statistical analysis of unfolding data _ performed for different values of @xmath3 _ allows us to separately probe the kinetics of native interactions and the dynamics of @xmath12 .",
