    "among the most important basic predictions of the theory of general relativity ( gr ) , we know that only one of them has not been yet directly tested : the existence of gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "the gws in the gr present two basic features : first , the particle associated with the wave , the graviton , is massless ; second , they have only two polarization states .",
    "the first feature comes exactly from the weak - field approximation in the space - time metric , yielding a spin - two massless particle field equation ; the second feature comes from the gauge invariance of the field equations under local coordinate transformations .",
    "these two features are strictly related , since a massless theory allows gauge transformations , and such transformations lead to two polarization states .",
    "however , a metric theory of gravitation , as we shall see , allows up to six polarization modes in general @xcite ; furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that spherical mass - resonant gw detectors might detect up to six polarization modes .",
    "these two facts , one theoretical and the other experimental , motivate us to investigate more carefully a general metric theory of gravitation in order to make it possible to predict further features that in the usual gr might , in principle , be lacking .    an immediate generalization of gr may be constructed taking into account some analogies with the basic ideas of quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "the simplest models in qft usually involve free real massless fields with global internal symmetries as , for example , the electromagnetic field ; then , to these models we can add further elements like mass , non - abelian internal symmetries , and so forth . taking into account again the example of the electromagnetic field ,",
    "the next generalization of this model is the introduction of a mass ( via the higgs mechanism ) , giving rise to a massive spin - one particle .",
    "these two vector models , the massless and the massive ones , are not theoretical conjectures ; they give rise to observable particles , the photon and the gauge bosons @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . then",
    ", since in gr the metric tensor field @xmath7 gives rise only to massless particles , the next extension consists in the introduction of massive degrees of freedom into the metric - the so - called  _ massive gravitons _ \" .",
    "there are some different effort towards a theory of gravitation with massive gravitons ; in this paper we shall consider the approaches worked out in the references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the approach followed in references @xcite and @xcite is an improvement of an earlier model pushed forward by m. fierz and w. pauli in the thirties @xcite .",
    "it is constructed by adding a mass term to the linearized einstein - hilbert action through the prescriptions of field theory , that is , a quadratic term in the fields @xmath8 appearing in the weak - field limit .",
    "we shall call this model as ",
    "modified fierz - pauli \" henceforth . in this model ,",
    "gws have _ six _ polarization modes @xcite , which may introduce interesting features in cosmology as we are going to show in this paper .    the second approach , devised by matt visser , @xcite is based upon a bimetric theory , first pushed forward by the work of rosen @xcite . in this model",
    "the mass term is introduced by a quadratic term depending not only upon a dynamical metric as in gr , but upon a nondynamical background metric as well .",
    "de paula _ et .",
    "@xcite showed that this theory leads to exactly the same dynamical equations as in the modified fierz - pauli model in the weak - field approximation , so that they are absolutely equivalent in this limit .",
    "they also have shown that gws in this model also possess six polarization modes as expected @xcite .    in the theory of _ massive gravity _ , as introduced in @xcite , the lorentz - invariance of the mass lagrangian is broken in the following way : the quadratic term in the metric perturbations is split into components , giving rise to five possible combinations , with each combination having a different coefficient ; then , these five different coefficients are interpreted as five _ mass parameters _ , each of them being proportional to a common scale @xmath9 .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the fierz - pauli model is promptly recovered through a suitable choice of the mass parameters . in @xcite , the masses for the gravitons are introduced through a very clever analogy with the higgs mechanism in qft : the lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken by a convenient choice of the  vacuum\"@xmath10for the goldstone fields , which leads to the model devised in @xcite .    in all the models introduced above the van dam - veltmann - zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity @xcite ,",
    "@xcite is absent @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that massive gravity is absolutely free of ghosts and classical instabilities provided the mass parameters obey some constraints @xcite .",
    "in addition to the efforts towards a direct observation of gws ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we might consider , as an excellent alternative for the time being ( since the gw detectors have not yet reached the proper sensitivity to make such direct observations ) , an indirect approach , using the recent work performed on the theory of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) anisotropies and polarization .",
    "the cmb spectrum might hide some  tracks \" of gws , or _",
    ", left by the interaction of the primordial cosmological gravitons with the cmb photons . the next generation of cmb satellites after planck is expected to measure the cmb polarization to a better degree of accuracy , and it can hopefully shed a light on the investigations of primordial gws through the measurements of the so - called e and b - polarization modes @xcite .",
    "this means that cmb polarization measurements might not only be decisive to detect gws , but it might also shed a light on the nature of the gravity itself ; in other words , cmb measurements could be decisive to test alternative theories of gravitation .",
    "this is exactly our goal in the present work : the analysis of cmb polarization induced by gws in a theory of gravitation with massive gravitons .    to this end , the present paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : pol ] we review the classification of plane gws in the newman - penrose formalism for an arbitrary theory of gravitation , deducing their six possible polarization modes . in section",
    "[ sec : massgrav ] we review the three different approaches to include massive gravitons into gr , and also discuss cosmological perturbations in these theories .",
    "then , in section [ sec : cmbpol ] we review the basics of radiative transfer in the presence of weak gravitational fields , laying the ground for discussing the sachs - wolfe effect in a theory of gravitation with massive gravitons in section [ sec : sachswolfe ] , and the effect of gw vector longitudinal modes on the thomson scattering in section [ sec : thomscat ] . in section [ sec : boltzeq ] we get together all the results , obtaining the related radiation transfer equations ( boltzmann equations ) for each polarization mode . at the end of this paper",
    "we discuss the obtained results and make the correspondent conclusions .",
    "the polarization states for a gw in an arbitrary metric theory of gravitation are given by the independent modes of the riemann tensor . in order to compute its components in an lorentz - invariant scheme ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce , following the pioneering work of newman and penrose , @xcite , the quasiorthonormal complex - null basis @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real null - vectors and @xmath9 and @xmath14 are a pair of complex numbers , satisfying the following orthogonality relations : @xmath15 we follow @xcite and choose the following set of null vectors , @xmath16 all satisfying ( [ npbasis ] ) . with the basis given by ( [ nullvectorsk ] ) - ( [ nullvectorsmbar ] ) we can split the riemann tensor into its irreducible parts , namely , the weyl tensor , whose ten independent components are given by five complex scalars @xmath17 , the ricci tensor , whose nine independent components are given by the scalars @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the ricci scalar @xmath27 . throughout this section , we consider only plane gw propagating in the @xmath28 direction , whose time dependence is given by @xmath29 , and we use for the flat minkowski metric @xmath30diag@xmath31 .    in this context , we may prove that the differential and algebraic properties of the riemann tensor reduce the number of independent components to six @xcite , given by +   + _ i _ ) _ the weyl tensor _ : @xmath32    _ ii _ ) _ the ricci tensor _ :    @xmath33     + _ ii _ ) _ the ricci scalar _ : @xmath34    we can reduce , therefore , the number of independent components of the riemann tensor to the set @xmath35    henceforth , we call ( [ npamplitudes ] ) _ newman - penrose _",
    "_ _ amplitudes_. they play the role of definite helicity states @xmath36 under rotations around the z axis in a nearly lorentz coordinate frame .",
    "in particular , the two real np amplitudes @xmath37 correspond to the state @xmath38 ( which defines the scalar modes ) , whereas the complex np amplitudes @xmath39 correspond to @xmath40 ( vector modes ) , and @xmath41 to @xmath42 ( tensor modes ) .",
    "these polarization modes can be represented on the @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 plane as can be seen through the effects of a gw on a ring of dust particles ( see reference @xcite for further details ) .",
    "now , following @xcite , it is very useful to introduce the  driving - force matrix \" @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the proper time and @xmath49 represents a null  retarded time \" as measured by an ideal detector in the coordinate system @xmath50 . from ( [ drivingforcematrix ] )",
    "we define a basis for the gw polarizations as follows : first , we represent the np amplitudes as @xmath51 ( from now on , whenever the _ polarization index _",
    "@xmath52 appears , it will always indicate a given np amplitude according to the sequence given in ( [ p1]-[p6 ] ) , so that @xmath53 stands for @xmath54 , and so forth ) .",
    "now , writing the np amplitudes ( [ psi2 ] ) , ( [ psi3 ] ) , ( [ psi4 ] ) and ( [ phi22 ] ) in cartesian coordinates ( recall that the np basis given by ( [ nullvectorsk ] ) - ( [ nullvectorsmbar ] ) can be written in terms of the coordinates @xmath50 ) , we get the following result @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the _ basis polarization matrices _ , given by @xmath57    therefore , the polarization of a gw in an arbitrary metric theory of gravity can be fully described by the basis polarization matrices @xmath56 . however , due to the tensorial character of the space - time metric it is convenient to cast the polarization basis ( [ polbasis ] ) into a tensor ; hence , along with its spatial components , given by @xmath58 , there are the @xmath59 and @xmath60 components , which are zero by the very definition of the  full driving - force matrix\"@xmath61 ( [ drivingforcematrix ] ) , so that @xmath62 hence , the _ polarization tensor _ assumes the form    @xmath63",
    "let us now analyze how do gws arise in the case of the fierz - pauli modified model . in this case , the graviton mass lagrangian appears as a quadratic term in the perturbation of the metric tensor @xmath8 in the weak - field limit , so that its action is given by @xcite , @xcite : @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the planck mass .",
    "if instead of the contribution @xmath68 to the last term on the right - hand side of ( [ action1 ] ) one had @xmath69 , this model would correspond to the original fierz - pauli action , which is plagued by the vdvz discontinuity @xcite .",
    "the einstein equations associated with the action ( [ action1 ] ) are given by @xmath70 then , imposing the conservation of the stress energy - momentum tensor , @xmath71 , we get the following constraint to the field @xmath8 on a minkowski background , @xmath72 where we have defined @xmath73    the equation ( [ hbarconstraint ] ) is exactly the same found in gr , but in the present case it emerges as a constraint from the conservation of the stress energy - momentum tensor rather than a gauge choice , as in gr . this constraint eliminates four degrees of freedom out of the ten independent components of the space - time metric , leaving then only six independent modes .",
    "since these modes correspond exactly to the polarization states of the gw , we may readily associate the components of @xmath74 with the correspondent ones of ( [ polariztensor ] ) , so that the only nonzero contributions are the spatial components @xmath75 .    using the arguments above and plugging equation ( [ hbarconstraint ] ) into ( [ eqmotion ] )",
    ", we obtain , in the absence of sources , @xmath76 which is clearly a klein - gordon equation for a wave propagating in the direction @xmath77 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we henceforth drop the bar over the tensor on the left - hand side of ( [ hbardef ] ) and simply write it as @xmath78 .    due to the oscillatory character of equation ( [ waveq ] )",
    "we may expand the tensor field @xmath78 into the fourier modes as follows , @xmath79 which enables us to write down the following decomposition in terms of the polarization tensor ( [ polariztensor ] ) : @xmath80 in particular , for the transverse - traceless ( tt ) component of the tensor perturbation to the metric @xmath78 ( corresponding to the @xmath81 mode with @xmath82 ) , we write @xmath83 so that fourier transforming ( [ httff ] ) to get @xmath84 in the configuration space , we see that this tensor satisfies ( [ waveq ] ) , that is @xmath85 which reduces to the gw equation for gr in the limit @xmath86 .",
    "the tensor @xmath84 encompasses then both transverse polarization modes  @xmath87 \" and  @xmath88 \" characteristic of gr .",
    "we write the extension of definition ( [ httff ] ) to the @xmath89 modes ( associated with @xmath90 ) as @xmath91 which corresponds to a longitudinal polarization state . as we shall see in section [ sec : sachswolfe ] , these modes can also induce an unusual angular pattern for the cmb photons and , in consequence , induce a different signature in its polarization pattern .    in this paper",
    "we do not consider the gw scalar polarization modes @xmath92 and @xmath26 , since they couple to the @xmath93 scalar component in the metric perturbation on cosmological scales , and then do not produce  handedness \" to excite the cmb b - polarization mode .",
    "the bimetric model proposed by visser in @xcite combines into a single theory a dynamical space - time metric with a nondynamical metric which allows the introduction of a mass for the graviton even in the strong - field limit .",
    "however , as was shown by de paula _ et .",
    "@xcite , in the weak - field limit the bimetric model is absolutely equivalent to the modified fierz - pauli model as discussed above . due to this property",
    "we henceforth consider the modified fierz - pauli solely .      in the case of massive gravity ,",
    "as we have pointed out in the introduction , the underlying ideas are a bit different .",
    "let us now write down the space - time metric in the weak - field limit as @xmath94 where @xmath95 plays the role of a perturbation to the minkowski background metric , and assumes the form @xcite , @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 are scalar fields , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are vector fields , and @xmath101 is a tensor field .",
    "the vector and tensor fields of ( [ pertmetricmassgrav ] ) satisfy the well known constraints @xmath102 necessary to match the number of independent fields to the ten independent components of the metric @xmath95 .",
    "now , we construct the mass contribution to the action of the theory as a quadratic term in the tensor fields as well , but breaking the lorenz invariance as suggested in @xcite @xmath103.\\ ] ] now , plugging the decomposition ( [ pertmetricmassgrav ] ) into the mass lagrangian ( [ masslagr1 ] ) and in the usual einstein - hilbert lagrangian of gr , and adding up these terms , we get the following equation for the tensor field @xmath101 @xcite @xmath104 which is exactly the same equation for the tt metric contribution of the modified fierz - pauli model given by ( [ waveqtt ] ) , representing the  genuine \" gw polarization modes for massive gravity . as we have argued in section [ sec : modfp ] , the @xmath89 content of the modified fierz - pauli model plays the role of extra gw longitudinal polarization modes ; however , in massive gravity , the vector fields @xmath99 and @xmath100 evolve as massive spin - one particles with transverse polarization , and have nothing to do with extra gw polarization states .    besides this original approach devised by v. rubakov @xcite , there is another way of breaking the lorentz symmetry of the massive lagrangian which resembles the higgs mechanism in qft . in this case",
    ", we introduce a set of four goldstone fields @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and a scalar , a vector and a tensor field constructed as follows @xcite , @xcite : @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath27 is the energy scale of the theory . with such elements",
    "we introduce an arbitrary function @xmath111 , so that the action for massive gravity reads @xmath112,\\ ] ] where the first term on the right - hand side represents the usual einstein - hilbert action , and @xmath113 is the lagrangian for ordinary matter minimally coupled to the metric .",
    "we can show that in the linear perturbation regime given by ( [ linearapprox ] ) , after setting the goldstone fields to their  vacuum \" values , @xmath114 and substituting these values and the decomposition ( [ pertmetricmassgrav ] ) into ( [ massgravaction ] ) we get exactly the same mass lagrangian as ( [ masslagr1 ] ) , with the mass parameters now being related to the functions @xmath115 and their derivatives @xcite , @xcite .",
    "once we have discussed the key features of metric perturbations around a flat minkowski background , let us now address the same question in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background .",
    "we start with gr in which , in the standard theory of cosmological perturbations @xcite , the metric @xmath116 is decomposed exactly in the same way as we did in ( [ pertmetricmassgrav ] ) but , in this case , we multiply all these components by the square of the scale factor of the universe @xmath117 ( @xmath118 is the conformal time ) , that is @xmath119 the constraints for the cosmological case are the same as ( [ pertmetricconstr ] ) .",
    "now , since we are interested in the cmb polarization induced by gws , we focus only on the tt part of the metric perturbation ; in this case , the einstein equation for the tensor field is given by ( the prime @xmath120 indicates a derivative with respect to conformal time ) @xmath121 which simply describes transverse gw travelling on an expanding background .    in the case of the modified fierz - pauli model the same metric decomposition",
    "can not be performed due to the extra polarization modes ; we instead introduce @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are scalar fields , @xmath125 is a divergenceless vector field , and @xmath78 is the cosmological version of the tensor given by the solution to equation ( [ waveq ] ) , carrying the correspondent six polarization modes spanned in the np formalism .",
    "the two scalar fields , plus the two components of the transverse vector field and the six modes of the tensor field give exactly the required ten degrees of freedom .",
    "the mass lagrangian for this model can be constructed analogously as in ( [ action1 ] ) , that is , it appears as a quadratic term in the metric ( [ pertmetmodfp ] ) .",
    "the full action is then obtained by adding up this contribution to the usual einstein - hilbert one , and the einstein equations can be derived using the standard tools . before doing that",
    ", it is convenient to decompose the tensor perturbation @xmath78 into its tt and longitudinal parts in the fourier space . in ( [ fourierexph ] ) the whole time - dependence of @xmath78 is contained in the exponential since it is a solution to a wave equation of the form ( [ waveq ] ) ; now , such time - dependence changes because of the extra temporal function @xmath117 appearing in ( [ pertmetmodfp ] ) , which introduces a damping in the oscillation .",
    "therefore , we fourier - expand the massive tensor perturbation @xmath78 as @xmath126 where @xmath127 so that the tt and longitudinal components of @xmath128 can be written in the same foot as ( [ httff ] ) and ( [ hvec ] ) , that is @xmath129 now , extracting the einstein equations from the action for the cosmological fierz - pauli model as we have sketched above , we see that both fields @xmath130 and @xmath131 satisfy the same dynamical equations @xmath132    in the case of massive gravity , the cosmological perturbations to the metric are given by ( [ cosmopertmetricmassgrav ] ) , together the following set of perturbations to the goldstone fields in the unitary gauge ( [ goldsvac ] ) , @xmath133 where @xmath134 e @xmath135 are scalar fields and @xmath136 is a divergenceless vector field . now",
    ", under infinitesimal coordinate transformations @xmath137 we can show that the following vector fields @xmath138 are invariant .",
    "the action for massive gravity on a flat frw background is then given by ( [ massgravaction ] ) with ( [ cosmopertmetricmassgrav ] ) and the goldstone fields set to their vacuum values ( [ goldsvac ] ) ; the matter lagrangian @xmath139 is assumed to be described by a perfect fluid whose perturbations for the fluid four - velocity are @xmath140    with these features , the einstein equations for the tensor field @xmath101 are given by @xcite , @xmath141 whereas for the gauge - invariant vector fields defined by ( [ defvecpot ] ) the einstein equations read @xmath142 @xmath143 where @xmath144 , and @xmath145 is the parameter appearing the equation of state of the ordinary matter , @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "solving equations ( [ cosmovecpertmg1 ] ) - ( [ cosmovecpertmg3 ] ) we conclude that the only relevant vector field is @xmath147 , whose amplitude decays with @xmath148 @xcite , which is exactly the same behavior of vector fields as derived in gr .",
    "therefore , the fierz - pauli modified model and massive gravity give rise to the same results for the tt polarization modes of the tensor perturbations as can be seen from equations ( [ tttensorpertmfp ] ) and ( [ tensorpertmg ] ) , whereas for vector perturbations the situation changes drastically . in the modified fierz - pauli model",
    "the vector modes of gw polarization obey the same equation as the tt modes , ( [ vectensorpertmfp ] ) , so that they really may contribute to the polarization of cmb as we have shown in @xcite for the field @xmath101 ; however , in massive gravity , the vector perturbations behave exactly as in gr , which means that they decay too fast after the inflationary phase and do not leave any signature on cmb polarization .",
    "therefore , the vector modes of the modified fierz - pauli model , unlike the predictions of gr , massive gravity , and other modified models of gravity , can leave signatures on the cmb . to see how this can be achieved ,",
    "let us estimate now a limit mass to be detected by cmb polarization experiments , according to the discussion in @xcite .",
    "since the equations for the tensor ( [ tttensorpertmfp ] ) , and vector ( [ vectensorpertmfp ] ) modes are identical , the dispersion relations are also identical , given by @xmath149 now , since in gr only gw with frequencies @xmath150 within the range @xmath151 to @xmath152 may leave a signature on cmb polarization @xcite , we see that these frequencies correspond to comoving wavenumbers @xmath12 within the range @xmath153 to @xmath154 .",
    "we then use the values of @xmath12 of gr , varying the frequencies in order to obtain constant nonzero graviton masses through equation ( [ disprelation ] ) . as a result ,",
    "if the values of the graviton mass @xmath9 lie within the range @xmath155 - @xmath156 , the correspondent frequencies have values very close to the expected in gr ; in particular , there is a graviton mass limit , @xmath3 , so that below this limit the dynamical evolution of the massive modes is indistinguishable from the tensor massless modes .",
    "hence , since the vector modes in the modified fierz - pauli model are governed by the same equation as the tensor modes , then the graviton mass limit for the vector modes should be exactly the same .",
    "along with the value discussed above for the vector massive modes , there are other mass limits obtained so far in the literature by using different tests .",
    "for instance , goldhaber and nieto @xcite found a limit @xmath157 analyzing the motion of galaxies in clusters .",
    "later on , talmadge _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the variations of kepler s third law when compared with the orbits of earth and mars , and found a limit @xmath158 .",
    "recently , finn and sutton @xcite calculated the decay of the orbital period of the binary pulsars psr b1913 + 16 ( hulse and taylor pulsar ) and psr b1534 + 12 due to emission of massive gravitons , and found @xmath159 .",
    "once we have discussed the key features of the different theories of gravitation with massive gravitons , we now turn our attention to the polarization of cmb .",
    "to do so , we initially review the theory of the radiative transfer in the presence of weak gravitational fields , following closely the seminal paper by polnarev @xcite ( for a pedagogical introduction , see @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a given beam of radiation characterized by its _ stokes parameters _",
    "@xmath160 , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the intensities of the radiation in the directions @xmath13 and @xmath52 , respectively ; @xmath163 is the total intensity of the wave , and the parameter @xmath124 is given by @xmath164 .",
    "these functions are strictly related to the photon distribution function , which can be cast in a symbolic vector of the form @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the other parameter associated with linear polarization .",
    "the components of @xmath167 are functions of the conformal time @xmath118 , the comoving spatial coordinates @xmath168 , and also of the photon angular distribution . since the photons are scattered by the free electrons prior to recombination via thomson scattering , their distribution function will be shifted according to the equation @xcite @xmath169,\\ ] ] where @xmath150 is the photon frequency , @xmath170 is the photon momentum , @xmath171 $ ] is the scattering term given by @xmath172=-\\sigma_{t}n_{e}a\\left[\\hat{f}-\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int^{1}_{-1}d\\mu'd\\varphi ~ p\\left(\\mu,\\varphi,\\mu',\\varphi'\\right)\\hat{f}\\right],\\ ] ] @xmath173 is the thomson scattering cross - section , @xmath174 is the number of free electrons in the unit comoving volume , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 is the scattering matrix given by @xcite @xmath177\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 @xmath179 @xmath180 where we have defined @xmath181 .    in equation ( [ boltz1 ] )",
    "the third term on the left - hand side shows the influence or signature of the gws on the cmb polarization , whereas the term on the right - hand side gives the details of the thomson scattering .",
    "since the term ( [ collterm ] ) depends upon the photon angular function through the angles @xmath182 , we see that different gw imprints may lead to different processes of polarization via thomson scattering . in the next two sections we address these issues in detail .",
    "as we have seen in section [ sec : cosmopert ] , the modified fierz - pauli model and massive gravity are equivalent with respect to the gw tt tensor modes , but only the vector modes of the first model may give rise to relevant contributions to cmb polarization . hence , from this section on , we shall always consider only the fierz - pauli model to address all the issues concerning gw vector modes .",
    "we have discussed in section [ sec : cmbpol ] that the cmb photons are polarized due to the thomson scattering with the free electrons in the epoch of recombination .",
    "prior to thomson scattering , the cosmological perturbations imprint a signature on the photon angular pattern , the so - called _ sachs - wolfe _ ( sw ) effect , which can be understood as the shift of photon frequency along the line of sight .",
    "this effect can be computed through the geodesic equation for the photon ; then , using the metric perturbation ( [ pertmetmodfp ] ) around a flat frw space , and the constraint @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the photon four - momentum , the geodesic equation reads for the tensor field @xmath78 , @xmath185\\frac{d \\eta}{d\\lambda},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is an affine parameter .",
    "the product @xmath186 appearing in ( [ geodgen ] ) may be evaluated as follows : first , since the photon travels along an arbitrary direction @xmath170 , let us construct a reference frame around the gw propagation vector @xmath187 such that the gw polarization modes assume the simplified form given by ( [ polariztensor ] ) .",
    "to this end we introduce the _ polarization vectors _ @xmath188 , defined by @xmath189 where @xmath190 is given by ( [ polariztensor ] ) for each polarization component @xmath52 , satisfying @xmath191 the trihedron @xmath192 is then a reference frame around the gw direction @xmath187 in which the polarization tensor preserves the simple form ( [ polariztensor ] ) .",
    "second , let us express the photon momentum @xmath193 in terms of spherical coordinates around ( [ gwbasis ] ) , so that the following relations hold , @xmath194 therefore , using ( [ polariztensor ] ) and ( [ photonmom ] ) , it follows that @xmath195 @xmath196 @xmath197 @xmath198 where @xmath199 are the usual spherical harmonics .",
    "the results ( [ prodepsprepsi3 ] ) - ( [ prodepspimpsi4 ] ) show us that the gw imprint upon the photon angular distribution is in the form of a quadrupole , with @xmath200 for the @xmath2 modes ( @xmath82 , which coincides with gr ) , and with @xmath201 for the @xmath89 modes ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "hence , from relations ( [ cosmofourierexph ] ) , ( [ cosmofourierexph1 ] ) , ( [ geodgen ] ) and ( [ prodepsprepsi3])-([prodepspimpsi4 ] ) we get the following geodesic equations :    _ i _ )",
    "@xmath0 : @xmath202    _ ii _ ) @xmath81 : @xmath203 where @xmath204 .",
    "then , massive gravitons with the @xmath81 polarization modes give rise to the usual tensor sw effect in gr , whereas the @xmath0 modes do not yield its well - known vector version in gr ( see , for example , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this happens because @xmath0 modes arise as gw longitudinal states of polarization , and not as a massive vector fields as in gr or massive gravity .",
    "anyway , they will leave a different signature on the cmb polarization by means of thomson scattering , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "we now turn to the derivation of the thomson scattering term ( [ collterm ] ) for massive gravitons .",
    "let us consider first that the incident radiation prior to be thomson scattered is unpolarized , with the angular pattern dictated by the sw effect ( [ geodpsi3 ] ) and ( [ geodpsi4 ] ) . in this case , the stokes vectors for the incident radiation are given by    _ i _ ) @xmath0 : @xmath205    _ ii _ ) @xmath81 : @xmath206    where we have defined @xmath207    now , defining the operator @xmath208 as @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the scattering matrix ( [ collterm1 ] ) , it is straightforward to see , for @xmath211 ( @xmath212 ) , that @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 are constants , and @xmath216 is a basis vector such that @xmath217 where @xmath218 and @xmath219 are constants as well . from ( [ apsi3 ] ) - ( [ defbasis2 ] )",
    "we readily see that ,    _ i _ ) @xmath0 : @xmath220      the basis vectors given by ( [ apsi3 ] ) and ( [ bpsi3 ] ) , ( [ apsi4 ] ) and ( [ bpsi4 ] ) allows us to factor out the angular dependence of the photon distribution vectors , and they constitute the first - order contribution to @xmath167 .",
    "the remaining contribution for @xmath167 comes from the @xmath222 solution , that is , in the absence of gws , in which the photon distribution vector is given by @xmath223 now , the linearized photon distribution vector can be written as @xmath224,\\ ] ] where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are functions to be determined as solutions of the boltzmann s equations ( [ boltz1 ] ) .",
    "now , once we have obtained the form of the photon distribution vector ( [ phdistvec ] ) for the tt and longitudinal gw mode , we are able to write down the full boltzmann equations ( [ boltz1 ] ) .",
    "they are given by    _",

    "the functions @xmath231 and @xmath232 are defined as @xmath233 @xmath234 and the scattering rate @xmath215 is defined as @xmath235 , and finally @xmath236    the equations ( [ boltzpsi41 ] ) and ( [ boltzpsi42 ] ) for massive gravitons with @xmath2 mode are identical to the correspondent ones in gr ; the difference here lies on the boltzmann equations for the @xmath89 modes , ( [ boltzpsi31 ] ) and ( [ boltzpsi32 ] ) , which do not appear in gr . since the vector and tensor modes satisfy the same dynamical equation , and the mathematical form of the equations ( [ boltzpsi31 ] ) and ( [ boltzpsi32 ] ) is very different from ( [ boltzpsi41 ] ) and ( [ boltzpsi42 ] ) , it is clear that the vector polarization modes of massive gravitons leave a characteristic signature distinguishable from the tensor one , which could , in principle , be probed by measurements on the cmb @xmath4 and @xmath237-modes . since the experiments in the planck satellite will improve the wmap5 results for the @xmath4-mode , we may expect that such future measurements might decide whether nontrivial gw signatures - as we showed here through equations ( [ boltzpsi31 ] ) and ( [ boltzpsi32 ] ) for @xmath89-modes - appear or not in the cmb polarization spectrum . in this case , we conclude that cmb polarization measurements may be decisive to test alternative theories of gravitation - in particular , the massive model as we discussed here .",
    "we have analyzed in this work three theories of gravitation with massive gravitons , and we have shown that the modified fierz - pauli model coincides with massive gravity for the tt tensor field in linear perturbation theory around minkowski and flat frw backgrounds .",
    "we have shown that such tensor perturbations associated with massive gravitons give rise to the usual tensor sw effect , lead to the same boltzmann equations for these modes in gr .",
    "we have deduced the dynamical equations for the gw vector longitudinal polarization modes ( @xmath89-modes ) in the modified fierz - pauli model and shown that they do not give the same results of massive gravity , in which vector perturbations behave like in gr ; instead , they give rise , in a cosmological scenario , to a nontrivial sw effect which leaves a vector signature of the quadrupolar form @xmath238 on the cmb polarization . also , such massive vector modes possess a mass limit of @xmath239 as the tensor modes , so that below this limit the fierz - pauli model is absolutely indistinguishable from gr in terms of the dynamical evolution .    analyzing the einstein equations for such @xmath89-modes we concluded that these vector signatures could be present at recombination epoch , unlike the vector perturbations in gr and massive gravity , which would decay too fast and would not leave any signature on cmb polarization .",
    "therefore , we calculated the new basis for the thomson scattering for such @xmath89-modes , and then deduced the appropriate equation for the radiative transport . based upon these results we have shown qualitatively that @xmath0-mode vector signatures could clearly be distinguished on the cmb polarization from the usual @xmath2 tensor modes if the former do exist ; hence , we could look for such signatures in the @xmath4-mode performed by planck satellite .",
    "in this sense we argued that planck polarization measurements could be decisive to test alternative theories of gravitation .",
