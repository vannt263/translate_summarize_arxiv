    "in part i , the double well potential problem ( dwp ) is defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an @xmath2 real symmetric matrix , @xmath3 is an @xmath4 real matrix , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . by introducing a continuous variable transformation @xmath8 , the double well potential problem ( dwp )",
    "can be transformed into the following equivalent quadratic program over one nonhomogeneous quadratic constraint ( qp1qc ) : @xmath9 the dual problem of ( qp1qc ) and the dual of the dual were studied in part 1 ( theorem 1 ) in order to find a global minimum solution to problem ( dwp ) . for practical applications , knowing only the global minimum of a double well potential function may not be sufficient .",
    "for example , the double well potential model can be used to describe the ion - molecule reactions , where the intermediate molecule complexes must go across the energy barrier to cause reactions @xcite .",
    "researchers have to know the potential difference between the energy wells ( caused by local minima ) and energy barrier ( caused by local maximum ) .",
    "the understanding of all types of critical points of a double well function is thus necessary .",
    "mathematically , we are motivated by the pioneering work of martnez @xcite which showed that a trust - region subproblem ( trs ) @xcite of the following form @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 being a positive scalar ) has at most one local , but non - global , minimizer .",
    "please notice that , on one hand , problem ( qp1qc ) can be regarded as an extension of problem ( trs ) towards the nonhomogeneous and possibly singular case . on the other hand ,",
    "the penalty version of the trust - region subproblem , namely , @xmath12 ( with the penalty parameter @xmath13 being sufficiently large ) is clearly a special case of the double well potential problem ( dwp ) .",
    "therefore , our approach to analyzing the local non - global minimizer of a double well potential problem extends the results of @xcite .",
    "moreover , when restricted to problem ( trs ) , our approach simplifies the proof provided in @xcite .",
    "although , in general , a double well potential problem may have infinitely many local , but non - global , minimizers ( see figure 1 ) , we ll show that , after taking the space reduction technique developed in section 2 of part i , the reduced nonsingular problem has at most one local non - global minimizer and at most one local maximizer .",
    "[ fig:0 ]        we remark that characterizing the local maximizer of the trust - region subproblem ( [ tr:1])-([tr:2 ] ) can be reduced to the problem of finding a local minimizer of ( [ tr:1 ] ) with @xmath1 being replaced by @xmath14 .",
    "however , due to the non - symmetric nature , it is no longer the case for the double well potential problem ( [ d - well ] )",
    ". hence martnez s approach may not be able to characterize the local maximizer for a general ( dwp ) problem .    in the rest of the paper , a characterization of the local , but",

    "then , a characterization of the global minimizer of a double well function is given in section 3 , while the local maximizer is characterized in section 4 .",
    "computational algorithms for each type of the optimizers of a double well potential function are proposed in section 5 with some illustrative examples .",
