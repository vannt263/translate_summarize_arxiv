    "the kek linac was constructed as an injector of the photon factory storage ring about 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "the first beam of 2.5-gev electrons was provided in 1982 .",
    "this linac now provides electron / positron beams to several rings @xcite : a ) 3.5-gev positrons to the kekb ler ( kek b - factory low - energy ring ) , b ) 8-gev electrons to the kekb her ( high - energy ring ) , c ) 2.5-gev electrons to the pf ring , and d ) 2.5-gev electrons to the pf - ar ring .",
    "the first control system , which consisted of mini - computers and camac interfaces @xcite , was replaced by the present control system in 1993 @xcite .",
    "the present system comprises unix workstations and vme computers .",
    "it has been upgraded occasionally @xcite and used over the past eight years .    in this article ,",
    "we discuss newly introduced subsystems in recent years .",
    "they were introduced in order to improve the control functionalities , and/or to enable better maintenance capabilities .",
    "three subsystems are described in detail in section  [ subsystems ] .",
    "the experienced problems between the subsystems and the original control system , and their solutions are discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the present control system comprises 46 unix workstations , 27 vme computers with the os-9 operating system , 140 plc ( programmable logic controller ) controllers , and 11 camac interfaces with a network port .",
    "a home - made rpc ( remote procedure call ) , based on tcp / udp protocols , are used for communication between them . a simplified view of the control system is shown in fig .",
    "[ overview ] .",
    "the total number of control signals is about 6000 ( in 2-byte unit ) . since 1998 , when the cp violation study started with the kekb rings , the operation of the linac exceeded 7000 hours per year .",
    "the number of control transactions handled by the control system increased every year , and reached 350 transactions per sec . in june , 2001 @xcite .      since the end of the 1980es , we have had strong interest in using pcs .",
    "the pc - based operator s console system started with dos pcs @xcite , and later reinforced with windows pcs @xcite , has been successfully used for more than ten years . in the early phase ,",
    "the following points were preferable for us : a ) enhanced capability of 2-byte code ( japanese characters ) handling , b ) good development environment of graphic applications , and c ) low cost .",
    "the present console system comprises about ten pcs ( windows  nt and windows  2000 ) .",
    "the surveillance applications for accelerator devices were developed in visual  basic , and have been used in daily operation .",
    "the operation log - book using ms - sql and access @xcite is extensively used everyday with this console system .",
    "communication with the control system , which runs at the unix workstations , is made by a gateway ( a windows pc ) .",
    "when the gateway receives a control request from a console pc by the ole , it communicates with the appropriate device server(s ) by using the rpc protocol ( see fig .  [ overview ] ) .",
    "the gateway and the present console system have been successfully used over the past six years .",
    "the main part of the control system for the kek linac was renewed in 1993 @xcite . however , the local controllers ( shown as sbc in table  [ frontend ] ) remained . in recent years the maintenance of these local controllers has become difficult .",
    "thus , we decided to replace them with new controllers .",

    "< , < , < \" , ]     [ architecture ]    the present control system for the kek linac , which started in 1993 , can be expressed as a typical standard of the 1990es model .",
    "we conclude that our extensions ( introducing subsystems in the past eight years ) can be understood as an evolution toward the new standard of 2000es .",
