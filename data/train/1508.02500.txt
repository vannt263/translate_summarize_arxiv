    "recently , the icecube collaboration has reported the detection of 37 neutrino events with energy between @xmath9 , of which three have energy above 1 pev  @xcite . according to the recent analyses  @xcite ,",
    "the three - year data are consistent with equal fluxes of all three neutrino flavors and with isotropic arrival directions . however , the neutrino flux required to fit the data in @xmath10 range is around @xmath11 @xmath12s@xmath13sr@xmath13 per flavor , and rejects a purely atmospheric explanation at @xmath14 .",
    "therefore astrophysical and/or new physics explanations have been pursued for the origin of these high energy neutrinos .",
    "possible astrophysical sources are involved with supernova remnants ( snr )  @xcite , active galactic nuclei ( agn )  @xcite , and gamma - ray bursts ( grb )  @xcite , all of which assume some specific emission spectra due to different production environments . in a model independent analysis , the best - fit power law spectrum from the icecube analysis",
    "@xcite is @xmath15 @xmath12 s@xmath13sr@xmath13 .",
    "it is not very straightforward to fit such a spectrum by astrophysical sources . in all cases ,",
    "extragalactic sources are needed due to the isotropic feature and galactic constraints  @xcite .",
    "then identifying such astrophysical sources will be crucial for further understanding of icecube events .",
    "dark matter ( dm ) and other new physics interpretations have been also investigated in various ways or models .",
    "heavy dm might decay into sm particles that give energetic pev neutrinos  @xcite  , or it could decay into some light dm particles which interact with nucleons and mimic neutrino events  @xcite",
    ". the resulting neutrino flux would still be consistent with isotropy so far , since galactic and extragalactic dm contribute at the similar order .",
    "one unique feature of dm explanation is that there should be sharp energy cut - off in the neutrino spectrum , which could be tested by future data .",
    "also , a possible gap around 400 tev @xmath16 1 pev , although not statistically significant yet , motivated considerations of new interactions , two - component flux and leptophilic dm decay  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a simple dm model to explain the icecube pev events . a dark sector with new @xmath0 gauge symmetry is introduced and can have connection with the standard model ( sm ) sector through neutrino - portal interactions as well as the higgs portal interaction .",
    "fermionic dm ( @xmath1 ) has @xmath16 pev mass and mostly decays into three - body final state with dark higgs ( @xmath3 ) , sm higgs ( @xmath4 ) and active neutrino .",
    "the produced neutrinos from primary @xmath1 decay and the secondary @xmath4 and @xmath3 decays can explain the observed pev event spectra , while the atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos are included for the low - energy part .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce our dm model with dark @xmath0 gauge symmetry , heavy right - handed neutrino portal and higgs portal interactions . in section .",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] we outline the general formalism for calculating neutrino flux from galactic and extragalactic dm decay . in section .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we present both total and differential decay width for the relevant three - body decay in our model and compare the numerical results with icecube data . in section .",
    "[ sec : relic ] we discuss a possible mechanism to generate the correct relic density for dm and direct / indirect detection constraints .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions .",
    "we consider a dark sector with a dark higgs field @xmath17 and a dirac fermion dm @xmath1 associated @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "their @xmath0 charges are assigned as follows  : @xmath18 we begin with the following renormalizable and gauge invariant lagrangian including just one singlet right - handed ( rh ) neutrino @xmath19 and one lepton flavor ( more @xmath19s and/or flavors can be easily generalized ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a left - handed ( lh ) sm @xmath22 lepton doublet , @xmath23 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath24 is the field strength for @xmath0 gauge field @xmath25 , @xmath26 is for sm hypercharge @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the kinetic mixing parameter .",
    "two types of yukawa couplings , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , can be taken as real parameters , ignoring cp violation for simplicity .",
    "we define covariant derivative as @xmath31 .",
    "since we are interested in explaining the icecube pev events in terms of dm @xmath1 decay , we shall take @xmath32 .",
    "other parameters in our model are free variables .    the scalar potential @xmath33 of this model is given by @xmath34 both electroweak and dark gauge symmetries are spontaneously broken by the nonzero vacuum expectations values of @xmath23 and @xmath17 : @xmath35 here @xmath36gev is the same as sm value but @xmath37 might be taken as a free parameter . in the unitarity gauge",
    ", we can replace the scalar fields with @xmath38 note that @xmath4 and @xmath3 shall mix with each other thanks to the higgs - portal operator , ( the @xmath39 term ) .",
    "term can also help to stabilize the electroweak vacuum  @xcite . ] through this mixing , @xmath3 can decay into sm particles",
    ". another important mixing happens among three neutral gauge bosons , photon @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath25 .",
    "such a mixture would enable an extra mass eigenstate @xmath42 ( mostly @xmath25 ) to decay sm fermion pairs .",
    "then dm @xmath1 scattering off nucleus is possible by the @xmath43 exchange , and the cross section essentially depends on @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy to choose small @xmath28 , or heavy masses to evade the constraints from dm direct detection  @xcite .",
    "when the right - handed neutrino @xmath19 is much heavier than @xmath1 , we can integrate it out and obtain an effective operator , @xmath45 which would make @xmath1 decay possible but long lived .",
    "after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , we have several higher dimensional effective operators from the aforementioned operator eq . ( 2.4 ) as follows : @xmath46 with the common factor @xmath47 for all these operators . if kinematically allowed , all the above operators induce @xmath1 decays into different channels with fixed relative branching ratios . within the heavy @xmath1 limit , @xmath48 , the mass operator @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operator ] ) would induce a tiny mixing between @xmath1 and @xmath5 with the mixing angle @xmath50 approximately given by @xmath51 then the gauge interactions for @xmath1 and @xmath5 will generate the decay channels , @xmath52 with their branching ratios being proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "two dim-4 operators , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , would lead @xmath1 to the following decays , @xmath56 with their branching ratios being proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "it is also straightforward to get the following relation for the branching ratios , @xmath58 therefore , all the decay branching ratios are basically calculable and completely fixed in this model .",
    "note that the decay modes with @xmath43 or @xmath3 are unique features of dm models with dark gauge symmetries .",
    "another interesting phenomenon in this model is that three body decay channel @xmath59 is dominant over all other channels when @xmath60 : @xmath61 since we actually have an enhancement from heavy @xmath62 even though there is a phase space suppression from three - body final states .",
    "there are another three - body decay channels that are equally important : @xmath63 with branching ratios @xmath64 due to the goldstone boson equivalence theorem . in the following ,",
    "if not otherwise stated explicitly , we use @xmath59 to represent all these channels and in numerical calculations we take all of them into account .    to give a rough impression for the relevant parameter ranges , we can perform an order - of - magnitude estimation ( complete formulas and details of calculation are given in the appendix ) : @xmath65 which shows the required value for the combination @xmath66 .",
    "if one additionally assumes that @xmath19 should be responsible for neutrino mass through the usual type - i see - saw mechanism , then we have @xmath67",
    ". therefore we would have @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 and , @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 . in any case",
    ", @xmath30 is very tiny and seems unnaturally small .",
    "however , it is still natural a la t hooft  @xcite since taking @xmath74 enhances symmetries of the theory , namely dm number conservation .",
    "is conserved in the limit @xmath75 . ] in later discussion , we shall take @xmath76 as free parameters , unless specified .",
    "the neutrino flux from dark matter decay is composed of galactic and extragalactic contributions which are equally important as we shall see below . galactic neutrino flux at kinetic energy @xmath77 from dm decay in our milky way dark halo is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is partial width for decay channel @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the neutrino spectrum at production , @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the distance to earth from the dm decay point , @xmath84kpc for the solar system and @xmath85 is the observation angle between the line - of - sight and the center of the milky way . for the galactic dm density distribution",

    "the flux is not very sensitive to dm density profile , so our discussions and results will still apply if another different profile is used .",
    "we can also get the extragalactic or cosmic contribution from a formula similar to the above one , by taking cosmic expansion into account , namely the red - shift effect  @xcite : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is red - shifted to @xmath77 as @xmath91 , the red - shift @xmath92 is defined as @xmath93 with present scale factor @xmath94 being normalized to @xmath95 , the critical energy density @xmath96 and @xmath97 is dm @xmath1 s fraction .",

    "we have obtained the total width @xmath107 and normalized differential decay widths @xmath108 the details of the calculation are given in the appendix where complete formulas with nonzero mass parameters are also presented .",

    "just for illustration , we choose the mass of dm @xmath1 around @xmath112 pev and its lifetime @xmath113s .",
    "the neutrino spectra are multiplied by @xmath114 in order to account for the energy dependence of the neutrino - nucleus cross section so that it might be compared with icecube data more easily .",

    "there are some crucial differences between our model and some others in the literature .",

    "@xcite considered the effective operator , @xmath135 with @xmath136 , which induces mainly two - body decay of dm @xmath1 , @xmath137 in this scenario , the neutrino spectrum shows that there should be no gap between @xmath138  @xcite .",
    "our model predicts that the dominant decay mode are @xmath63 which is a consequence of @xmath0 dark gauge symmetry and the dark charge assignments of the dark higgs and dark matter fermion @xmath1 .",
    "the neutrino spectra from primary @xmath1 decay and the secondary decays of @xmath4 and @xmath3 have different shapes and could account for the possible gap .",
    "however , we should note that the current data can not favor one over another yet due to its low statistics .",
    "also the neutrino flux in our model is softer than the one predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , leptophilic three - body decay induced by dimension - six @xmath139 was considered with global @xmath140 or @xmath141 flavor symmetries . besides the neutrino spectrum difference",
    ", our model involves an additional gauge boson which mediates the dm - nucleon scattering , and could be tested by dm direct searches .",
    "our scenario is also different from those in which dm decay is also responsible for the low - energy flux  @xcite .",
    "the dm lifetime in ref .",
    "@xcite should be around @xmath142s , as mainly determined by the low energy part of events .",
    "this is partly due to the reason that the branching ratio into neutrinos and @xmath143 there should be about @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively , to account for the possible gap . on the other hand , in our scenario @xmath146 of the decay channels",
    "have prompt neutrinos .",
    "another main difference is that three - body - decay usually gives broader spectra at pev range than two - body - decay considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , but more data is required in order to discriminate this difference .",
    "assuming the dark photon @xmath25 is much heavier than @xmath147 , the dm - nucleon scattering cross section can be roughly estimated as @xmath148 @xmath149 is the typical cross section value for sm @xmath147-mediating dm - nucleon process . comparing it with the direct detection bound for @xmath150gev dm , we should have @xmath151 for heavy @xmath152 pev .",
    "this can be easily satisfied , for example , with @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "in our above investigation , we have not discussed the relic abundance for dm @xmath1 yet .",
    "since @xmath1 is very heavy , the unitary bound on its annihilation makes the dm @xmath1 impossible to be thermally produced and a non - thermal process is needed ( see ref .",

    "<S> the recently observed icecube pev events could be due to heavy dark matter ( dm ) decay . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a simple dm model with extra @xmath0 gauge symmetry and bridge it with standard model particles through heavy right - handed neutrino </S>",
    "<S> . the dirac fermion dm @xmath1 with mass @xmath2 pev can dominantly decay into a dark higgs ( @xmath3 ) , the sm higgs ( @xmath4 ) and a neutrino ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the lifetime of @xmath1 is @xmath6 sec , the resulting neutrino flux can fit data consistently . the neutrino flux from @xmath7 in our model is softer than the one predicted from @xmath8 , for example . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss a possible mechanism to produce dm with the right relic abundance . </S>"
