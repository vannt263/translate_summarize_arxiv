    "the study of the nuclei around @xmath1no , the heaviest elements for which detailed spectroscopic data can be obtained with the current generation of facilities @xcite , is intimately connected with the search for superheavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is because spectroscopic information such as the energies of single - particle states and the rotational response can be used to constrain theoretical models and their parameterizations .",
    "the need for such a constraint is dictated by the fact that different theoretical models predict different locations for the `` island of stability '' of shell - stabilized superheavy nuclei .",

    "thus , the experimental data on fission barriers in the actinide region provide an important testing ground for density functional theories ( dft ) .",

    "one way of obtaining information on the energies of spherical subshells active in the vicinity of expected shell closures in the `` island of stability '' is by studying well - deformed one - quasiparticle states in heavy actinide and/or light transfermium nuclei . as illustrated in the nilsson diagram of fig.[nilsson ] , the deformation causes the spherical single - particle states to split and forces low-@xmath20 states emerging from high-@xmath21 spherical subshells ( for example , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 subshells , see left panel of fig .",
    "[ nilsson ] ) to come closer to the fermi level in much lighter systems .",
    "nuclei around @xmath1no represent the end of the region in which reliable experimental data on the structure of deformed one - quasiparticle states are available @xcite . although the decay studies of heavier odd - mass nuclei such as @xmath24hs and @xmath25sg ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) probe one - quasiparticle states , these nuclei can not be used for a meaningful comparison with theory because of the tentative nature of the configuration assignment .",
    "this is even more true for odd - mass nuclei with @xmath26 which are identified by only a few events .",
    "the first ever fully self - consistent description of deformed one - quasiparticle states in the framework of cdft was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite on the example of the @xmath27cf and @xmath28bk nuclei .",
    "more systematic calculations covering the rare - earth and actinide regions and a number of the cdft parameterizations are currently in progress @xcite .",
    "since these results confirm the general observations obtained in ref.@xcite , we will illustrate the main features of the description of quasiparticle spectra of deformed nuclei on the example of @xmath13cf ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - cf251 ] ) .",
    "two types of discrepancies between theory and experiment are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig - cf251 ] . _",
    "first , the calculated spectra are less dense than experimental ones .",
    "_ this is especially visible in the pairs of deformed states emerging from the same spherical subshells ( namely , the @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 $ ] states from the @xmath31 subshell as well as the @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] states from the @xmath34 subshell ) , the energy gaps between which are considerably stretched as compared with experiment .",
    "_ second , while the calculated energies of a number of states are rather close to experiment , the energies of some states and their relative positions deviate substantially from experiment . _ for example , only nl1 gives the correct ground state @xmath35 $ ] in @xmath13cf , whereas nl3 gives the @xmath369/2 $ ] ( fig.[fig - cf251 ] ) .",
    "the displacement of the calculated centroids of the above discussed pairs of deformed states from experimental ones clearly suggests that the discrepancies between experiment and calculations can be traced back to energies of spherical subshells from which deformed states emerge .        comparing theory and experiment",
    "it was concluded in ref.@xcite that in the nl1 and nl3 parameterizations , the energies of the spherical subshells , from which the deformed states in the vicinity of the fermi level of the @xmath0 nuclei emerge , are described with an accuracy better than 0.5 mev for most of the subshells .",
    "the discrepancies ( in the range of @xmath37 mev ) are larger for the @xmath38 ( nl3 , nl1 ) , @xmath39 ( nl3 ) , @xmath31 ( nl1 ) and @xmath40 ( nl3 ) spherical subshells . considering that the rmf parameterizations were fitted only to bulk properties of spherical nuclei this level of agreement is good .",
    "in contrast , the accuracy of the description of single - particle states is unsatisfactory in the nlsh and nl - ra1 parameterizations .",
    "this clearly indicates that before extrapolating to superheavy nuclei the quality of the parameterization with respect of the description of single - particle energies has to be tested .",
    "these results clearly indicate the need for an improvement in the description of the single - particle energies within cdft .",
    "there are a number of possibilities which need further exploration .",
    "the stretching of the energy scale in cdft calculations as compared with experiment is related to the low effective mass ( lorentz mass in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath41 of the nucleons at the fermi surface in cdft .",
    "it has been demonstrated for spherical nuclei that particle - vibration coupling brings the average level density in closer agreement with experiment in relativistic @xcite and non - relativistic calculations @xcite .",
    "this effect is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ no254 ] where the particle - vibration coupling leads to a pronounced increase of the level density around the fermi surface both for proton and neutron subsystems comparatively to the pure rmf spectra .",
    "similar effects are expected in deformed nuclei . however , the corrections to the energies of quasiparticle states in odd nuclei due to particle - vibration coupling are expected to be less state dependent in deformed nuclei because ( due to fragmentation ) the surface vibrations are less collective in deformed nuclei than in spherical ones @xcite .",
    "the measured and calculated energies of the single - particle states at normal deformation provide constraints on the spherical shell gaps of superheavy nuclei .",
    "such an analysis restricts the choice of cdft parameterizations only to those which predict @xmath5 and @xmath6 as shell closures in superheavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of particle - vibration coupling compresses the single - particle spectra in the @xmath42 nucleus and decreases the size of above mentioned gaps .",
    "however , this nucleus still remains a doubly magic spherical superheavy nucleus in cdft @xcite .",
    "additonal information on the structure of single - particle states can be obtained by studying the rotational response in odd - mass nuclei .",
    "this is especially important for nuclei at the edge of the region where spectroscopic studies are possible ( the nuclei with masses @xmath43 ) , for which alternative methods of configuration assignment are not feasible . to illustrate that we use rotational structures in @xmath44am .",
    "the rotational bands based on the nilsson orbitals @xmath45 $ ] ( from the @xmath46 subshell ) , @xmath47 $ ] ( from the @xmath48 subshell ) and @xmath49 $ ] ( from the @xmath50 subshell ) have been observed in this nucleus in ref.@xcite . as can be seen in the left panel of fig.[fig-241am ] , at low frequencies they have distinctly different kinematic moments of inertia @xmath51 .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of these bands has been performed in cranked relativistic hartree+bogoliubov ( crhb ) theory @xcite employing the nl1 parameterization of the rmf lagrangian and the d1s gogny force in the pairing channel .",
    "in addition , approximate particle number projection has been carried out by means of the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method .",
    "theoretical calculations ( right panel of fig.[fig-241am ] ) describe well the absolute values of the kinematic moment of inertia of different configurations and their evolution with rotational frequency .",
    "in particular , the splitting of two signatures of the @xmath45 $ ] configuration is rather well described in the model calculations . on the contrary , the @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath49 $ ] bands show ( with exception of very low frequencies in the case of the @xmath49 $ ] band ) no signature splitting .",
    "model calculations for the two signatures of the @xmath52 $ ] configuration show explicitly this feature",
    ". unfortunately , it was not possible to get convergence in the case of the @xmath49^+$ ] for that orbital @xmath53 . ] configuration .",
    "however , the analysis of the quasiparticle routhian diagram confirms that the @xmath49^\\pm$ ] configurations have to be degenerate in energy up to rotational frequency @xmath54 mev in agreement with experimental observations . at higher frequencies ,",
    "small signature separation is expected in the calculations .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned features , the relative properties of different bands both with respect of each other and with respect to @xmath55pu ( which has one proton less ) are well described in the model calculations .",
    "the increase of the kinematic moment of inertia in the bands of @xmath44am as compared with the ground state band in @xmath55pu is caused by the blocking effect which results in a decreased proton pairing .",
    "calculated kinematic moments of inertia @xmath51 of the indicated one - quasiproton configurations in @xmath13md are shown by lines .",
    "the configurations @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 $ ] , @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath59 $ ] are either signature degenerate or characterized by small signature splitting .",
    "thus , for simplicity we show the results only for one signature .",
    "the kinematic moments of inertia for observed band @xcite are shown by solid circles . ]",
    "[ fig - md251 ] shows another example of the description of rotational bands in crhb calculations .",
    "the single decoupled band observed recently in the odd - proton nucleus @xmath13md @xcite has been assigned to the @xmath60^{-}$ ] configuration .",
    "crhb calculations have been performed for several low - lying configurations .",
    "however , the @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 $ ] configurations can be excluded from consideration because they lead either to signature degenerate bands or to bands with small signature splitting ; as a consequence , both signatures are expected to be observed in experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculations for the @xmath60 ^ -$ ] configuration describe the experimental data rather well thus confirming the configuration assignment given in ref .",
    "note that the results obtained with the nl3 parameterization of the rmf lagrangian are close to the ones obtained with nl1 .",
    "thus , they do not alter the interpretation of the observed band .",
    "these two examples outline the current approach to the configuration assignment of one - quasiparticle states in odd - mass nuclei based on their rotational response .",
    "they clearly show that the rotational properties reflected through    * the absolute values of the kinematic moment of inertia ( especially at low rotational frequencies ) and their evolution with rotational frequency * the presence or absence of signature splitting * the relative properties of different configurations with respect of each other and/or with respect to the neighboring even - even nucleus    provide a useful tool for single - particle configuration assignment . however , it is necessary to recognize that this method of configuration assignment has to be complemented by other independent methods and has to rely on sufficient experimental data .",
    "the interpretation of the rotational band in @xmath64no is quite illustrative in this respect .",
    "initially , it was interpreted as based on the @xmath65 $ ] configuration @xcite . however , improved experiments allowed to identify the m1 transitions between opposite signatures of the observed band @xcite which led to the @xmath66 $ ] configuration assignment .",
    "the kinematic moments of inertia of the observed band under two configuration assignments are described within a typical theoretical uncertaintylr , where the discrepancy of around 15% is seen under the @xmath679/2 $ ] configuration assignment @xcite . on the basis of the moment of inertia , crhb calculations favor the @xmath61 $ ] assignment .",
    "note that the kinematic moments of inertia for the assigned @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] rotational bands in @xmath13es are described in crhb calculations within 7% accuracy @xcite . ] , and , as a result , the configuration assignment based only on rotational properties can not be reliable .",
    "the branching ratios of observed m1 and e2 transitions have to be used in order to distinguish different configuration assignments @xcite .",
    "the ( static ) inner fission barriers @xmath70 are important for several physical phenomena .",
    "the size of the fission barrier is a measure for the stability of a nucleus ( which decays by spontaneous fission ) reflected in its spontaneous fission lifetime  @xcite .",
    "the probability for the formation of a superheavy nucleus in a heavy - ion - fusion reaction is also directly connected to the height of its fission barrier  @xcite .",
    "the height @xmath70 is a decisive quantity in the competition between neutron evaporation and fission of a compound nucleus in the process of its cooling @xcite .",
    "the population and survival of hyperdeformed states at high spin also depends on the fission barriers  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath71process of stellar nucleosynthesis depends ( among other quantities such as masses and @xmath72-decay rates ) on the fission barriers of very neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .    however , the progress in the study of the fission barriers within covariant density functional theory has been slower than in its non - relativistic counterparts @xcite . until now the majority of the calculations have been performed under the restriction to axial symmetry ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , axially symmetric calculations can not be directly compared with experimental data since , as has been shown earlier in non - relativistic calculations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , the lowering of fission barriers due to triaxiality is significant and can reach @xmath73 mev in some nuclei . so far , the impact of triaxiality on the height of the inner fission barrier has only been studied in specific nuclei such as @xmath74hs @xcite and @xmath55pu @xcite within the rmf+bcs approach as well as @xmath55pu @xcite within the rhb approach .    in order to fill this gap in our knowledge ,",
    "a systematic investigation of the inner fission barriers within the triaxial rmf+bcs approach has been performed for the first time @xcite employing the recently developed nl3 * parameterization @xcite of the rmf lagrangian .",

    "@xcite : @xmath77 note that all states in the pairing window @xmath78 mev are taken into account . because the nuclei considered are all well bound , pairing is treated in the bcs approximation .",
    "the calculations are performed imposing constraints on the axial and triaxial mass quadrupole moments .",
    "the method of quadratic constraints uses a variation of the function @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the total energy , and @xmath81 denotes the expectation values of the mass quadrupole operators @xmath82 in these equations , @xmath83 is the constrained value of the multipole moment , and @xmath84 the corresponding stiffness constants @xcite .",
    "the results of these systematic calculations are shown in fig.[pot ] .",
    "the deformation energy curves ( shown by full black lines in fig .  [ pot ] ) for axially symmetric solutions are obtained as the @xmath85 cross - section of the potential energy surfaces .",

    "note that the potential energy surfaces are normalized to zero energy at the normal - deformed minimum .",
    "one can see that by allowing for triaxiality the fission barrier heights are reduced by @xmath86 mev as compared with axially symmetric solutions .",
    "this lowering depends on the proton and neutron numbers .",
    "it also brings on average the results of calculations in closer agreement with experimental data shown by green solid circles in fig .",
    "these circles display the height of the experimental fission barrier at the calculated @xmath72-deformation of the saddle point . on average calculated @xmath87-deformations of the triaxial parts of the fission path are close to 10@xmath88 .",
