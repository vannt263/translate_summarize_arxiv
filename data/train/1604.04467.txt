    "motivated by these experimental observations on different kinds of wake structures , a number of theoretical models have been proposed to explain the experimental findings .",
    "dubin @xcite claimed that the mach cones are the superposition of linear dispersive waves excited by the moving disturbance which was verified by ma and bhattacharjee @xcite by performing molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations for compressional mach cones in the far field approximations .",
    "an attention has also been paid to study the mach cone under the micro - gravity(@xmath0 ) conditions @xcite in a three dimensional crystal / fluid .",

    "@xcite under the @xmath1 condition on board international space station .",
    "an observation of single cone mach structure  @xcite was reported for the first time in a 3d fluid and the results were compared with a hydrodynamic model .",
    "soon after , the speed of sound was measured directly by exciting a double mach cone structure using a supersonic particle of mach number @xmath2 @xcite . however , a theoretical description of shear - wave mach cone in 3d strongly coupled complex plasma has already been proposed by bose _ et al .",

    "olarization force arises due to any kind of deformation of the debye sheath around the dust grains in the background of non - uniform plasmas .",
    "non - uniformity in plasmas arises due to non - zero gradient of local electron and ion density and/or their temperatures . according to hamaguchi and farouki @xcite ,",
    "the polarization force acting on the micron size dust particles can be expressed as , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the average charge ( @xmath5 represents the charge number ) on each particle and @xmath6 is the debye radius of plasma which can be defined as @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the ion ( electron ) debye radius and is given by @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the temperature and density of , respectively .",

    "however , there exists a critical dust size beyond which the net force on the dust grains is no longer a restoring force and the dispersion relation admits a transition from propagating daws to periodically growing perturbations .",
    "the threshold limit on dust grain size depends on plasma parameters and for a typical gas discharge plasma the threshold limit is @xmath12 m . the earlier studies on dust acoustic solitary waves ( dasws ) @xcite also showed considerable modifications of propagation characteristics in presence of polarization force .    in this article , we investigate the propagation characteristics of mach cone in presence of polarization force acting on micron sized charged dust particles in background of non - uniform plasma .",

    "it is clear from the above equations ( eqs .",
    "[ eqn : density ] and [ eqn : velocity ] ) , the projectile particle velocity ( @xmath26 ) plays an important role to determine the wake structure formation which can be expressed in terms of mach number , @xmath70  ( @xmath71 is being the dust acoustic velocity when the particle exerts only the electrostatic force ) .",
    "it is also clear from the above dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : disp ] ) , the dust acoustic velocity changes with the change of polarization force coefficient ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "it indicates that the modified mach number does not remain constant with the change of @xmath41 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the normalized damping coefficient , @xmath72 , the background neutral gas pressure , is also an important factor to the mach cone structures .",
    "although in some cases , we assume the mach number ( m ) is a constant quantity but in reality the mach number changes with the change of @xmath41 and @xmath73 .",

    "v - shaped mach cone with multiple wake structures can be clearly seen in both these figures .",
    "these patterns are caused by constructive and destructive interference of waves excited by the projectile particle , and their structures are determined by the wave dispersion properties of the medium as well as the disturbance - medium interaction .",
    "it also can be seen from the velocity field map ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) that the structures of multiple cones , with the outermost being most prominent .",
    "according to the earlier investigations of mach cone in complex plasmas @xcite , multiple structures arise due to strongly dispersive nature of the dust acoustic waves .",
    "this figure also indicates that the direction of the dust particle motion is perpendicular to the cone wings and parallel to the direction of wave propagation .",
    "it confirms that the mach cones are composed of compressional waves .    to study qualitatively the mach cone structure for different values of projectile particle velocity in terms of mach number and the polarization force",
    ", we first consider the case when the influence of damping is ( @xmath76 ) .",

    "2 shows the velocity field map of mach cone for a constant value of mach number ( @xmath78 ) at different values of polarization force coefficients , a ) @xmath65 ( absence of polarization effect ) , b ) @xmath79 and c ) @xmath80 .",
    "right panel ( d  f ) of fig .",
    "2 corresponds the same for @xmath81 with the same values of @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear from the left panel of the figure ( fig .",
    "2(a - c ) ) , there is a prominent change in the structural properties of the mach cone when @xmath41 increases at a constant value of @xmath82 and @xmath73 .",
    "the number of multiple wake structures reduces while the opening angle decreases with the increase of @xmath41 .",
    "the changes of opening angle with @xmath41 at constant @xmath82 can be explained from the dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : disp ] ) . with the increase of @xmath41 the velocity of the daws decreases resulting in an increase of the modified mach number . from the mach - cone - angle relation ,",
    "the opening angle reduces with the increase of this modified mach number .",
    "it is also noticed the curved nature of the wings of mach cones less significant as @xmath41 increases .",
    "the bending structures of mach cones also predicted by zhdanov _",
    "_ @xcite . in their theoretical studies they showed that either the time history of changes in the medium or the density gradient in the medium ( or both ) plays an important role to produce wings mach cone structures .",
    "although it is not clear in present situation which factor is responsible to form the wings but changes of the strength of polarization force certainly the inhomogeneity of the background plasma medium .",
    "it is also to be noted from the right panel of fig .",
    "2 the opening angle and number of multiple structures ( even to one ) due to the increase of mach number . in case of higher mach number ( m=2 )",
    ", the nature of the wings in the mach cone of velocity map also disappears .    in order to investigate the effect of dust - neutral collision frequency",
    ", we increase @xmath73 to 0.2 and plot the velocity vector map in fig .",
    "3 keeping all parameters constant . in accordance with earlier observations @xcite , the wakes are strongly damped and the oscillations in the wake region are smoothed out due to the decrease of the damping length , @xmath83 .",
    "it is also seen from the above figure that the effect of higher dust - neutral collisionality reduces the number of multiple - wakes structures down to two or even one irrespective of the mach number and the strength of polarization force .",
    "4 depicts the variation of maximum amplitudes of perturbed dust density in 2d plasma crystal for a set of mach number and dust - neutral collision rate .",
    "figure  4(a ) represents the same when the dust neutral collision rate remains unchanged at @xmath76 and the mach number changes from 0.8 to 2 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the amplitude decreases with the increase of @xmath41 for a given mach number .",
    "it suggests the increase of @xmath41 influences the wake - field oscillations to be damped which shows a similar effect when @xmath73 increases . as we discussed earlier ( see in eq .",
    "[ eqn : die ] ) dielectric function @xmath84 increases with the increase of @xmath41 for a given dispersive medium with constant @xmath6 and @xmath69 .",
    "it can be concluded from the expression of @xmath67 ( eq .  [ eqn : density ] ) the perturbed density decreases with the increase of strength of polarization force . for a given value of @xmath41",
    ", it should also be noted that the amplitude decreases with the increase of mach number .",
    "variation of maximum amplitude as a function of @xmath41 shows similar trend when we change the dust - neutral collision damping rate from 0.01 to 0.5 at a constant value of mach number ( m=0.8 ) as shown in fig .",
    "this figure also suggests that the amplitude of density perturbation decreases with the increase of @xmath73 for a constant @xmath41 .",
    "we have studied theoretically the modifications arising in the mach cone structure due to the presence of polarization force acting on the dust grains in an inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "numerical results for the perturbed density and velocity vector in the dust layers exhibit mach cone with the characteristic oscillatory wake patterns which is also observed in laboratory experiments . in our analysis ,",
    "special is paid to the dependencies on the mach cone structure for a wide range of polarization force at a given mach number and the dust - neutral damping rate .",
    "quantitatively , we noticed that the amplitude of the perturbed dust density decreases with the increase of the polarization force .",
    "an experimental observation is needed to verify the polarization - induced change in the mach cone structures .",
