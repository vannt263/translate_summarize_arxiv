    "samples of co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 ( @xmath15 ) were prepared starting from the elements taken according to stoichiometry , by heating well - ground powders in evacuated , sealed silica ampoules for 1 week at 673 k. the powders were then reground , pelletized , resealed in evacuated silica ampoules , and heated for 873 k for 4 d. a final heating was performed at 973 k for one week , of samples that had been ground up and pelletized again .",

    "it was found that neither the states near the fermi energy , not the magnetic moment were in any way affected by the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling . for ferromagnetic , rock - salt cos , the cell volume ( which is the sole free structural parameter )",
    "was optimized using full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) calculations using the wien2k code.@xcite exchange correlation was considered following the perdew - burke - ernzerhof@xcite parametrization .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction revealed all compounds in the series to be single phase , and well - fitted by rietveld profile refinement to the pyrite crystal structure described in fig .",
    "1 . results of the x - ray refinement are summarized in fig .",
    "2(a ) , which shows data for the two extreme compositions [ @xmath5 = 0.0 and @xmath5 = 0.5 ] in the series studied here .",

    "the decrease in the @xmath27 lattice parameter as a function of increasing @xmath5 ( substitution of co by fe ) arises from the different sizes of these ions ; six - coordinate , low spin co@xmath8 has an ionic radius of 0.65   whereas the corresponding radius for fe@xmath8 is 0.61  .@xcite the single internal parameter in the pyrite crystal structure is the position @xmath24 of s. we have used refined values of @xmath28 and @xmath27 to calculate s - s distances across the solid solution series . within experimental error , we find nearly no change in the s - s distance as a function of @xmath5 as seen in fig .",
    "this is an important experimental observation , which we discuss at length at a later stage . in fig .",
    "2(b ) we also show for comparison , structural data for the end - members cos@xmath2@xcite and fes@xmath2.@xcite      zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) magnetization @xmath29 as a function of temperature recorded on co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 are indicated in fig .",
    "zfc data were recorded in a field of 1000 oe upon warming from 5 k after cooling from room temperature under zero field .",
    "fc data were also collected upon warming from 5 k , after the samples were cooled under a 1000 oe field .",
    "all samples show evidence for ferromagnetism , with @xmath30s below 155 k. there is almost no zfc / fc separation in any of the samples , suggesting the samples are homogeneous , and also that they combine high permeability with low saturation fields .",
    "clear ferromagnetic @xmath30 onsets as well as widths of the transition are best seen from plots of @xmath31 _ vs. _ @xmath32 displayed in fig .",
    ". the @xmath30 onset does not seem to depend very much on @xmath5 , and after an initially increasing with @xmath5 , almost remains constant as seen in fig .",
    "data were acquired under relatively high field ( 1000 oe ) so even small clusters of spins are sufficient for the magnetization to rise .",
    "the midpoints of the @xmath31 _ vs. _ @xmath32 traces are therefore better indication of ferromagnetic @xmath30 .",
    "these are also shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) , and are seen to initially increase with @xmath5 and then decrease .",
    "the constant width of the transition [ difference between @xmath30 ( onset ) and @xmath30 ( midpoint ) ] for the different values of @xmath5 reflects that all the samples are homogeneous , and the transition is not due to small ferromagnetic clusters .",
    "magnetization at 5 k is displayed in fig .",
    "none of the samples showed any significant hysteresis implying co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 is a soft ferromagnet .",
    "therefore only the positive @xmath29 _ vs. _ @xmath33 quadrant is displayed .",
    "all the samples display saturation at fields well below 1 t. the saturation magnetization in bohr magnetons ( @xmath34 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath5 in fig .",
    "the dashed line is the expected spin - only value assuming each @xmath9 electron contributes 1 @xmath34 per formula unit to the magnetization . only the parent cos@xmath2 phase",
    "is seen to have a saturation magnetization less than the spin - only value .",
    "starting from @xmath5 = 0.1 through @xmath5 = 0.5 , all samples display spin - only behavior .",
    "this is an indication that all the samples except @xmath5 = 0.0 are within experimental error , perfect half - metals in terms of their being no `` leak '' in the magnetization from majority to minority spin states .",
    "such leaking is prevented by the complete absence of there are no minority spin states at the fermi energy .",
    "our results , for both ferromagnetic @xmath30 ( midpoint ) as well as saturation magnetization are nearly identical with those obtained by jarrett _ _ et al.__@xcite      an number of authors have provided detailed electronic structure descriptions of cos@xmath2.@xcite mazin@xcite has examined magnetism across the series co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to use structure refinements as inputs to obtain first principles electronic structures , and in particular , to calculate cohps so that trends in spin - polarized bonding across the solid solution series can be obtained .",
    "figure  5 shows total lmto densities of state ( dos ) in the two spin states for ( a ) _ hcp _ co metal , for ( b ) cos@xmath2 ( using the @xmath22 crystal structure obtained from x - ray refinements performed here ) and ( c ) fes@xmath2 using the crystal structure reported by finklea _ _ et al.__@xcite ; sg .",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath27 = 5.4281  , @xmath28 = 0.38504 .",
    "fermi energies are taken as 0 on the energy axis in panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "on going from co metal to cos@xmath2 , we observe a narrowing of @xmath6 states as well as the effects of the octahedral crystal generated by the @xmath35 moieties . in co metal ,",
    "the fermi energy lies in the minority spin states , in a region where majority [ @xmath36 states are also found .",
    "removal of these @xmath37 states by ionization ( forming co@xmath8 from co ) is an essential ingredient in rendering the system half metallic .",
    "panel ( c ) of this figure is the total dos of non - magnetic semiconducting fes@xmath2 distributed equally between the two spin states .",
    "we have coincided @xmath37 states of s ( in the region -20 ev to -10 ev with respect to the fermi energy , not shown ) by shifting the origin on the energy axis for the dos of fes@xmath2 , in order that the fermi energy is fixed to the fermi energy of cos@xmath2 .",
    "the assumption is that s @xmath37 is a core state which should not be affected by compound formation .",
    "fes@xmath2 is a semiconductor with a calculated band gap of about 0.8 ev.@xcite in both fes@xmath2 and cos@xmath2 , @xmath38 states of s below @xmath39 extend from about -8 ev to -2.5 ev . in cos@xmath2 , co @xmath6 states ( the @xmath40 manifold )",
    "start at -2.5 ev where s @xmath38 states terminate . in fes@xmath2",
    ", there is a gap between occupied s @xmath38 states and the metal @xmath40 manifold . comparing the dos of fes@xmath2 with cos@xmath2",
    ", we observe that the @xmath6 manifold in the former is shifted to higher energies .",
    "this is indicative of the general trend amongst the first row transition metals that as one goes to the right ( from sc through cu ) , metal @xmath6 levels are stabilized .",
    "to some extent , this trend is reflected in the pauling electronegativities which are 1.83 for fe and 1.88 for co. it is the same trend which shifts mx@xmath2 crystal structures from being layered ( with m@xmath41 ) to being three - dimensional ( with m@xmath8 ) in a process referred to as redox competition.@xcite in oxide materials , the descent of cation @xmath6 levels as one traverses first row transition metals results in the famous zaanen - sawatzky - allen phase diagram.@xcite in making solid solutions of cos@xmath2 and fes@xmath2 , we believe the distinctly shifted @xmath6 levels of fes@xmath2 have a role to play . while substitution of co by fe in the series co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 results in electrons being removed from the @xmath9 manifold , the @xmath6 levels themselves are pushed to higher energies ; the species ( fe ) which `` removes '' electrons actually creates donor states .",
    "this is one of the factors which affects the electronic structure across the solid solution .",
    "a more electronegative substituent might remove electrons from @xmath38 states of s , and this would be disastrous for the magnetism as demonstrated presently .",
    "we have performed lmto calculations on ordered supercells of pyrite cos@xmath2 after systematically replacing some of the co by fe .",
    "lattice @xmath27 and internal structural parameters @xmath28 for the calculations were taken from structure refinements of the nearest compositions as summarized in fig .",
    "2(b ) . in fig .",
    "6 shows densities of state for co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 , for ( a ) @xmath5 = 0.00 , ( b ) @xmath5 = 0.25 , and ( c ) @xmath5 = 0.50 . in all three compounds , the shape of unfilled states just above @xmath39 is `` box - like '' rising sharply with energy .",
    "the evolution of @xmath40 states with fe substitution ( in both spin directions ) seems to result from a weighted superposition of the @xmath40 states of spin - polarized cos@xmath2 and non - magnetic fes@xmath2 [ shown in fig .",
    "5(b and c ) ] .",
    "filled @xmath40 levels below @xmath39 seem pinned firmly in place .",
    "partially filled @xmath9 levels are shifted up in energy , to near ( the respective ) fermi energies.@xcite a feature of note is that at @xmath39 , ( the few ) states in the minority states are progressively removed as @xmath5 increases in co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "this result , as previously reported in the calculations of mazin,@xcite explains the less - than - perfect [ @xmath42 ] saturation magnetization of pure cos@xmath2 ( @xmath5 = 0 ) , and the increased [ @xmath43 ] magnetization as @xmath5 increases , seen in our magnetic measurements , and in the measurements of jarrett _ _ et al.__@xcite from a magnetism viewpoint , the extent of half - metallicity in this system can be obtained as the ratio of the saturation magnetic moment in bohr magnetons to the number of unpaired @xmath9 electrons .",
    "computationally , the magnetic moment , or more precisely , the polarization index @xmath44 given by:@xcite    @xmath45    provides an indication of the half - metallicity .",
    "we calculate @xmath46 for both the @xmath5 = 0.25 and the @xmath5 = 0.5 compounds .",
    "correspondingly , magnetic moments _ per _ formula units were respectively obtained to be 0.748 @xmath34 and 0.500 @xmath34 ; whereas for cos@xmath2 ( @xmath5 = 0 ) it was 0.898 @xmath34 .    the cohp@xcite is a very useful tool for mapping the energy dependence of pairwise bonding and antibonding interactions between atoms from first - principles electronic structure calculations , including in systems which are spin - polarized.@xcite figure  7(a ) shows pairwise co - s and s - s cohps of parent _ non - magnetic _",
    "cos@xmath2 , scaled by 0.5 .",
    "we have verified that the spin - orbit coupling is negligible .",
    "interactions are therefore confined to separate spin channels .",
    "non - magnetic cos@xmath2 has sharply antibonding states at the @xmath39 . switching on spin - polarization decreases these antibonding states , in keeping with the suggestion of landrum and dronskowski@xcite that sharply peaked antibonding cohps in non - magnetic calculations",
    "can be an indicator ( the equivalent of a stoner criterion ) of the electronic instability associated with spin polarization and ferromagnetism .    from fig .",
    "7(b ) , we observe bonding co - s cohps in the region of @xmath40 states and antibonding cohps corresponding to the region of @xmath9 states .",
    "@xmath39 in spin - polarized cos@xmath2 falls in a gap flanked by antibonding co - s(@xmath47 ) and antibonding co - s(@xmath48 ) , the s - s cohp in fig .",
    "7(c ) shows the strongly bonding region where the @xmath38 states of s are found .",
    "the effect of spin - polarization on s - s cohps is small but important .",
    "interestingly , the antibonding region of the s - s(@xmath47 ) cohp just above @xmath39 is slightly stabilized by spin - polarization , just as antibonding s - s(@xmath48 ) is slightly destabilized .",
    "antibonding s - s(@xmath47 ) state are what pin the fermi energy , and are perhaps the most significant states for discussing half - metallicity in these compounds .",
    "s - s states are pseudo - molecular so they not disperse very greatly .",
    "they can be expected to remain in place because there is no great change in the charge state or in the degree of charge - transfer in the system as @xmath5 is increased , as was observed from the constancy of the s - s distance . for antibonding s - s(@xmath48 ) states to descend through the fermi energy , the s - s bond would have to be elongated .    in support of our argument that the s@xmath4 units play a crucial role in determining the electronic structure of cos@xmath2 and the series co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2",
    ", we have performed first - principles calculations on hypothetical rock - salt cos , which has approximately the same atomic topology , and the same formal co valence as pyrite cos@xmath2 .",
    "figure  8(a ) shows the results of the structure optimization by plotting total energy as a function of the cubic cell parameter , as well as the corresponding magnetic moment of co. the gga - optimized cell parameter was determined to be 4.67  .",
    "the corresponding magnetic moment is about 0.5 @xmath34 _ per _ co. figure .",
    "8(b ) shows the densities of state of ferromagnetic cos in the two spin directions .",
    "it is seen that the crystal field in cos is much smaller than in cos@xmath2 .",
    "more importantly , cos is not a magnetic half - metal , despite minority spin states trying to nest in a pseudogap .",
    "the electronic structure is characteristic of so - called `` intermediate spin '' systems such as the finite - temperature electronic structure of the cobalt oxide perovskite lacoo@xmath49.@xcite",
    "the low curie temperatures of co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 make their use as spin injectors in spintronic circuitry unlikely.@xcite this system does however offer insights into the design of new half - metallic magnets .",
    "there are two questions which our results help to address .",
    "the first is , what renders a compound half - metallic ? from observing changes on going from ferromagnetic co metal to cos@xmath2 , we learn that @xmath37 and @xmath38 states at @xmath39 ( present in co ) are not good for half - metallic behavior since they are only poorly exchange split .",
    "compound formation through removal of @xmath37 and @xmath38 electrons is therefore useful .",
    "this suggests that even in systems such as the heusler compounds , x@xmath2yz , where x and y are usually transition elements and z is a main group element , it might help to have electronegative substituents at z ( for example , si rather than al).@xcite    the second question is how the system retains ferromagnetism and half - metallicity across the substitution range .",
    "we summarize our findings on the unusual electronic structure of the pyrites solid solutions co@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 in the scheme displayed in fig .",
    "9 . for low filling of @xmath9 states ( @xmath5 approaching 1 ) ,",
    "the electronic structure is characterized by `` box - like '' states above @xmath39 , with a very sharp rise in the number of states with energy , as depicted in fig .",
    "9(a and b ) .",
    "the origins of this sharp rise , as we have demonstrated , are s - s antibonding states , which persist just above the @xmath39 through the solid solution series .",
    "the states are sharp because they are pseudo - molecular .",
    "even small filling of empty states results in the stoner criterion being fulfilled@xcite and the rapid onset of ferromagnetism.@xcite the important role played by the shape of the dos in fulfilling the stoner criterion has been examined in detailed for transition metals by andersen _ _",
