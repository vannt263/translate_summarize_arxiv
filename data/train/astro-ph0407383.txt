    "an observational problem in research on active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is determining the masses of the central black holes .",
    "application of stellar and gas dynamical techniques , commonly used for normal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is difficult or impossible in type 1 agn due to the bright nucleus .",
    "a potential solution is the technique known as reverberation mapping @xcite , which has been used to estimate black hole masses for about 30 seyfert galaxies and quasars @xcite .",
    "reverberation mapping allows the radius of the broad line region , @xmath3 , to be determined by attributing the time lag between variations in the continuum and line emission to light travel time effects . assuming that the velocity width , @xmath4 , of the permitted emission lines is due to keplerian motion in the black hole potential , the mass can estimated by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant .",
    "thus , this method may provide an opportunity to study the role of the nuclear gravitational potential in large numbers of agn .",
    "but it has not yet been demonstrated that reverberation mapping yields @xmath1  values that are consistent with those obtained from analysis of the stellar and gas dynamics .",
    "given the difficulty of a direct approach , indirect methods must be used to compare these different techniques .",
    "our purpose in this study is to compare reverberation mapping and stellar dynamical measures of black hole mass using scaling relations between the black hole and the host galaxy bulge .",
    "the correlation between black hole mass and bulge absolute magnitude , @xmath2 , @xcite , can be used to compare results of these different approaches .",
    "however , comparisons of the @xmath1@xmath2  relation in active and normal galaxies have produced conflicting results .",
    "two early studies @xcite reported that the reverberation mapping masses for agn were smaller than the stellar dynamical masses in normal galaxies of the same bulge luminosity . this called into question the validity of the reverberation mapping masses , suggesting a systematic trend to underestimate @xmath1  by a factor of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that the masses were accurate and that there were real differences in the black hole masses of active and non - active galaxies of equal bulge mass .",
    "more recently , @xcite , revising his early assessment , and @xcite , using bulge magnitudes determined in most of their sample from hubble space telescope ( hst ) images and assuming disk - like kinematics for the blr , find that active galaxies follow the same @xmath1  ",
    "@xmath2  relation as normal galaxies .",
    "it is difficult to make a fair assessment of these differing results since some of these studies have used bulge magnitudes derived from the relation between bulge - to - disk ratio as a function of morphological type formulated by @xcite , while others have applied bulge - disk decomposition techniques to ground - based or hst images .",
    "furthermore , bulges of seyfert galaxies tend to be small  their typical effective radii in all but the nearest objects are a few arcseconds or less .",
    "this , combined with the effects of the bright nuclear source in type 1 objects , which are of course the candidates for reverberation mapping , makes ground based estimates of @xmath2quite tricky .",
    "the relationship between black hole mass and bulge stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath0 , @xcite , provides an alternative and independent way to compare stellar dynamical and reverberation mapping results . in this relation , which is stronger than the one using @xmath2 , @xmath0",
    "is measured in apertures extending to distances of a kiloparsec or so from the nucleus ( * ? ? ?",
    "* use apertures extending to the bulge effective radius , @xmath8 , and denote their measurement @xmath9 ) .",
    "the goal is to standardize the region over which the dispersion is determined and more importantly to minimize the influence of the nuclear black hole on the stellar kinematics .",
    "the small number of published @xmath0  measurements for type 1 agn , has until recently prevented a statistically significant investigation .",
    "@xcite found no deviation for 7 seyfert 1s from the @xmath10 relation .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by @xcite , using @xmath11}$ ]  in place of @xmath0 , on the assumption that the forbidden line kinematics in seyfert galaxies are predominantly the result of virial motion in the bulge gravitational potential ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . also , @xcite obtained @xmath0measurements for 6 seyfert 1 galaxies and find these values to be consistent with expectations from the @xmath12 relation .",
    "in this paper we present new measurements of @xmath0  in 14 seyfert 1 galaxies to check the @xmath1  values obtained from reverberation mapping for consistency with the @xmath10 relation  established by stellar dynamical techniques .",

    "the rc spectrograph was used with the lb1a ccd which has high quantum efficiency in the far - red ( @xmath83% at 8500  ) , excellent cosmetics and no fringing @xcite  an ideal detector for observing the ca  ii triplet  lines ( @xmath84 and @xmath85  ) .",
    "these properties allowed us to use a high dispersion grating ( bl 380 giving 0.46  / pixel in the raw data ) and a narrow slit ( 1@xmath86 ) to achieve high spectral resolution ( @xmath87  or @xmath88 km  s@xmath89  fwhm ) .",
    "we used an order - blocking filter ( og570 ) to prevent contamination by second - order blue light , which will of course be strong in seyfert 1 spectra .",
    "exposure times ranged between 3600 seconds for nearby bright galaxies ( e.g. ngc 4051 , ngc 3516 ) and 10,800 sec for fainter objects ( e.g. mrk 110 ) .",
    "standard spectroscopic reductions  bias subtraction , flat field correction , geometric distortion and wavelength calibration  were carried out using iraf .",
    "conditions were generally not photometric so only a relative flux calibration was applied .",
    "the strong telluric emission and absorption features in the far - red present a difficult reduction problem , particularly for the higher redshift galaxies in our sample . for targets with @xmath90 , where the ca  ii triplet  and night sky emission lines begin to overlap ( except 3c 390.3 , see section [ sec : galnotes ] ) , sky - subtraction was accomplished using the `` nod - and - shuffle '' observation mode , developed by @xcite and recently implemented at kitt peak .",
    "briefly , by repeatedly re - positioning the telescope ( nodding ) and shifting the charge on the detector ( shuffling ) , both the target and the sky are observed at the same spot along the slit and in the same pixels on the detector , permitting excellent sky subtraction .",
    "the drawbacks for the nod - and - shuffle technique are a factor of @xmath91 increase in the sky noise and extra overhead time for the telescope nods . although there were difficulties in the implementation of this mode at the time , we were quite pleased with the results and we recommend use of the perfected observing mode where sky subtraction is critical and signal - to - noise is not of primary concern .",
    "atmospheric absorption bands begin to be a problem at wavelengths above 8900  , again affecting the higher redshift members of the sample .",
    "even if the ca  ii triplet  lines are not directly affected , correction for these can be important for achieving a good fit to the continuum on the red side .",
    "we therefore obtained spectra of white dwarf spectroscopic standard stars , matched in airmass and observation time to our seyfert exposures , to use as atmospheric templates .",
    "experimentation showed that scaling the equivalent width of the atmospheric bands , by adding a constant value to the template and renormalizing , improved the results in some cases , helping to recover good line profiles for the reddest ca  ii triplet  line . in the case of 3c 390.3 ,",
    "the atmospheric absorption correction was quite critical since all of the ca  ii triplet  lines lie in a region of strong atmospheric absorption . in part due to",
    "the broad ca  ii triplet  features in this object , we were able remove the telluric lines successfully",
    ".    reduced , sky - subtracted nuclear spectra corrected for telluric absorption are shown in figure [ fig : rawspec ] .",
    "the spectra have been normalized to the mean counts in the spectral region near the ca  ii triplet  lines , whose positions are indicated for each object .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that a variety of spectral characteristics are present in these galaxies .",
    "the ca  ii triplet  lines show a range of equivalent widths presenting a challenge for analysis using the fcq technique in some cases .",
    "also a number of nuclear emission features , including broad oi @xmath92 , [ fe ii ] @xmath93 , paschen and ca  ii tripletitself in emission , appear in our spectra and must be removed before analysis with fcq .",
    "in fact for two galaxies , mrk 335 and mrk 509 , no velocity information could be obtained ( see section [ sec : galnotes ] ) . given the association of agn and starbursts we must also keep in mind that the strength of the ca  ii triplet  lines may be enhanced by young stellar populations rich in late - type supergiant stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      even in the far - red",
    ", the strength of the nuclear emission from type 1 agn relative to the contribution from the host galaxy makes obtaining high signal - to - noise spectra of the stellar absorption features a difficult task  effectively , the nuclear continuum is a source of noise . also broad and narrow line nuclear emission , even when not affecting the ca  ii triplet  lines",
    "must be carefully removed before the velocity dispersion measurements can be made . in some cases , where the stellar absorption lines are strong and",
    "the nuclear emission is weak , it was possible to include the nucleus of the galaxy in our longslit extractions without further processing .",
    "for other galaxies , however , the central rows of the longslit spectra had to be corrected for contaminating emission features , or when the absorption features were entirely lost in the noise , excluded altogether .",
    "oi @xmath94 and [ fe ii ] @xmath93 could often be removed by subtraction of a single or double gaussian fit . in other galaxies",
    "the blending of emission lines and continuum was more complex , producing an irregular continuum shape near the ca  ii triplet  lines .",
    "in several cases this required subtraction of a model of the unresolved nuclear spectrum prior to the dispersion measurements .    to produce the model , a narrow spectrum , usually two or three pixels wide centered on the nucleus was extracted .",
    "next , the weak ca  ii tripletabsorption features were removed from the model by subtracting the spectrum of a stellar template , which was broadened and scaled until the absorption lines vanished . then , using spectra of nearby ninth or tenth magnitude sao stars obtained prior to each galaxy exposure , we produced a seeing profile along the slit .",
    "this was combined with the model nuclear spectrum and subtracted from the original longslit data to correct for the contamination by the nuclear emission .",
    "the most important effect of this procedure is that it removes the irregular continuum shape from spectra immediately adjacent to the nucleus .",
    "this was particularly helpful in ngc 4051 , ngc 4151 and ngc 4593 , where the continuum on the blue side of the spectrum is distinctly uneven ( compare figures [ fig : rawspec ] and [ fig : fcqspec ] ) .",
    "this allowed us to extract spectra for the velocity dispersion analysis much closer to the nucleus than would have been possible otherwise , resulting in higher signal - to - noise and ensuring that as much of the bulge light was included as possible .",
    "velocity dispersions were obtained by analysis of the bulge line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) using the fourier - correlation quotient method @xcite .",
    "for each galaxy a spectral region , including only the ca  ii triplet  lines and a small section of continuum on either side , was used in the analysis ( rest wavelength 8460    @xmath62 8716   ) . in most cases ,",
    "the width of the spectrum along the slit was chosen to cover at least 1 kpc across each galaxy .",
    "for a few nearby galaxies we found that extending the slit all the way out to @xmath95 ( see table [ tab : bulgetab ] ) actually degraded the signal - to - noise while yielding effectively the same dispersion . in these cases we opted for the shorter slit length .",
    "for the fainter targets an optimal extraction maximizing signal - to - noise was used .",
    "although this does not generally correspond to @xmath95 as used by @xcite in defining the @xmath10 relation , given the difficulties posed by the nuclear emission , it was a reasonable and unavoidable compromise .",
    "nevertheless , our spectra include bulge starlight far enough from the nucleus to be beyond the influence of the black hole , while excluding emission from the kinematically colder galaxy disk .",
    "gauss - hermite polynomials were fitted to the losvd to determine the bulge systemic velocity , @xmath96 , and the bulge stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath96  and @xmath0  were estimated by running the fcq algorithm on monte carlo simulations of the data , created using a stellar template convolved with the losvd and adding in noise to match that of the observed spectrum .",
    "the results for the sample are given in table [ tab : s1sigma ] , including @xmath1  values .",
    "figure [ fig : fcqspec ] shows the data used in the fcq analysis shifted to the rest frame along with the template broadened by the derived losvd .",
    "velocity dispersions for six of our sample galaxies were published by @xcite . a comparison of our results with theirs is shown in figure [ fig : usthem ] .",
    "we find that our values agree with theirs quite closely , with a marginal tendency for our dispersions to be larger at the low @xmath0  end .",
    "this may be a consequence of our narrower slit ( they used 2@xmath86 ) which excludes more disk light  a result that may be important for systems with smaller bulges .",
    "to investigate the reported deviations of agn from the @xmath1  ",
    "@xmath2relation discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , we have used archival hst images to measure bulge magnitudes .",
    "ten of the seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample were observed in the program of wfpc-2 snapshots @xcite using the f606w filter and another , ngc 4151 , was observed with the f547 m filter .",
    "the main difficulty in determining the bulge magnitudes from these images was removing the point source nucleus , which is unfortunately saturated in the f606w images . to accomplish this , model psfs , created using the tiny tim software package @xcite ,",
    "were shifted , scaled and subtracted from the images . the scale factor which produced a minimum r.m.s .",
    "deviation in the residual image in an annulus incorporating the innermost unsaturated pixels , was chosen as an initial guess .",
    "since this tends to overestimate the nuclear luminosity , further trial - and - error scaling of the psf around this value allowed us to fine tune the results ; the final best subtraction was judged by examining the removal of peculiar features of the outer psf ( rays and ring like structures ) in the residual images .",
    "typically we found that a range of scale factors produced acceptable results .",
    "the resulting uncertainty in the bulge magnitudes , which given the subjective nature of the psf scaling we uniformly take to be @xmath130@xmath972 , was folded into our error estimates . because the galaxy bulges are reasonably large in the images ( @xmath98 pixels in most cases ) our results do not depend critically on psf subtraction .",
    "the purpose is mainly to remove the extended wings of the unresolved nuclear emission and recover as much of the inner bulge light as possible . for most objects",
    ", we were able to extend our bulge profile analysis down to about half an arcsecond .",
    "other complications included removing the cosmic ray hits from the images and accounting for emission lines from the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "about 90% of the cosmic rays were removed automatically using a script written in iraf . of the remaining cosmic rays",
    "those close to the nucleus were removed by hand .",
    "the broad bandpass of the f606w filter includes the [ oiii ] @xmath99 , [ nii ] @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and h@xmath102 emission lines which arise in the nlr and will not be removed with the point - like nucleus . using the stsdas task calcphot , and the model seyfert 2 galaxy spectrum provided by the synphot package",
    ", we were able to estimate the nlr flux by scaling the model spectrum to match the [ oiii ] flux tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the [ oiii ] fluxes are almost all rated quality `` a '' by whittle indicating that they were obtained through large apertures and that there is good agreement when more than one measurement has been published .",
    "thus we are confident that we have accounted for the bulk of the nlr emission .",
    "this provided a correction to our bulge magnitude estimates and is listed in table [ tab : bulgetab ] .",
    "ideally , two - dimensional direct fitting techniques , such as that of @xcite , and a less restricted model , e.g. a sersic function , could and should be used to investigate the bulge morphologies of these galaxies .",
    "we note in the descriptions of the individual galaxies below ( section [ sec : galnotes ] ) that the bulge profiles of mrk 590 and mrk 817 are better fit by exponentials than @xmath103 laws .",
    "also some display inner spirals , dust lanes , lenses and bars that further complicate the analysis .",
    "however , accounting for these difficulties and the uncertainties associated with nlr emission and saturated psfs is outside the scope of our program .",
    "thus , in this paper , we adopt either the @xmath103 law or exponential fits to the azimuthally averaged luminosity profiles and use these to estimate bulge magnitude .",
    "we used the iraf task ellipse to produce luminosity profiles from the image isophotes which were then fitted with the sum of an exponential or @xmath103-law bulge and an exponential disk . in carrying out the fits",
    "it is important to avoid getting trapped in spurious minima of @xmath104 .",
    "the procedure we adopted to ensure meaningful results , was to fit the disk region first . then holding the disk parameters fixed we included a fit to the bulge .",
    "as a final step , we fitted both bulge and disk simultaneously allowing all parameters to vary , using the parameter values from the previous steps as the initial guess .",
    "the luminosity profiles and fits are plotted in figure [ fig : lumprof ] .",
    "note the presence of bars or inner ovals in a few galaxies ( e.g. ngc 4593 , mrk 79 , ngc 7469 ) , seen as a run of excess light over the fit , between the bulge and disk .",
    "we generally excluded these regions from the analysis .",
    "bulge magnitudes were then estimated from the scale length and surface brightness parameters of the fits , assuming @xmath105  km  s@xmath89  mpc@xmath89 .",
    "foreground extinction from the milky way has been removed , but no correction for dust within the host galaxy has been applied .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : bulgetab ] and notes on the characteristics of individual galaxies are given in section [ sec : galnotes ] .",
    "we estimated the error in the bulge magnitudes using monte carlo simulations .",
    "random noise with the same r.m.s .",
    "deviation as the fit to the luminosity profiles was added to the data and the profile was refitted .",
    "the resulting standard deviations in the fit parameters after 30 trials was then propagated through to estimate the error in bulge magnitudes from the fitting .",
    "these were then added in quadrature to the uncertainty in the nuclear magnitudes and adopted as the uncertainties listed in table [ tab : bulgetab ] .",
    "we also include an uncertainty of 15% in the distances of each galaxy to compute the final errors in the absolute magnitudes .",

    "confirmation of the @xmath12 relation  for seyferts is important support for this tenet of agn physics .",

    "[ fig : mbhmbul ] we plot @xmath2  for the seyfert 1 galaxies in table [ tab : bulgetab ] , versus the reverberation mapping @xmath1values . again for comparison , ellipticals and bulges from the @xcite sample , are plotted as @xmath120 symbols , where we have converted their absolute @xmath129 magnitudes as published in @xcite to the f606w bandpass and scaled to @xmath130 .",
    "given the narrow range of colors for the @xcite sample ( @xmath131@xmath97@xmath132 , std .",
    "dev . 0@xmath97047 ) and the expectation that the seyfert bulge colors are likely to be more scattered , we choose to apply the correction to the ellipticals .",
    "the conversion was determined using the template elliptical galaxy from the synphot package and the calcphot task ( @xmath1330@xmath9733 ) .",
    "although not a strong trend , the majority of seyferts lie below and to the right of the olsb fit to the ellipticals , shown as the solid line .",
    "this is consistent with the report by @xcite of lower black hole masses at a given bulge magnitude .",
    "the median deviation in black hole mass for the seyferts from the fit to the normal galaxies is @xmath134 dex , or about a factor of 2.5 .",
    "there is really no significant correlation for the seyferts , ( linear correlation coefficient @xmath135 ) , compared with a strong trend found for the ellipticals ( @xmath136 )",
    ". this may be due in part to the smaller sample size , but this can not be the whole story since the seyferts show a strong correlation between @xmath1  and @xmath0(see section [ sec : mbhsig ] ) .",
    "we suggest that it is the bulge luminosities , not the black hole masses , which are the origin of the deviation . taken in this way the bulges of seyferts are on average 0@xmath977 brighter than normal ellipticals with similar black hole masses based on the distribution of points in figure [ fig : mbhmbul ] .",
    "strong support for this interpretation is found by plotting the faber - jackson diagram , @xmath0vs .",
    "@xmath2 , for both samples , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fj ] .",
    "we find that that at a given @xmath0  the seyfert galaxies tend to lie above the fit to the normal galaxies .",
    "the mean residual in @xmath2  for the seyferts relative to the normal galaxy fit is @xmath620@xmath974 .",
    "furthermore there is a moderately strong correlation for the seyferts , ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this improvement over the results for @xmath2  vs. @xmath1  naturally suggests that @xmath2  is more closely related to @xmath0  than to @xmath1 , and that the increase in bulge luminosities with black hole masses is secondary and follows through their mutual trends with velocity dispersion .",
    "the result is identical to that of @xcite who found a similar offset for a much larger sample , consisting of mostly seyfert 2s .",
    "the result also confirms the earlier conclusions of @xcite who used galaxy rotation amplitude and @xmath11}$ ] as virial parameters , to demonstrate a tendency for brighter bulges in seyferts than normal galaxies of the same bulge mass .",
    "some ambiguity remained , however , since the bulge magnitudes in those studies were not obtained by bulge / disk decomposition .",
    "instead , after correcting for nuclear emission , the relation between bulge - to - disk ratio and hubble stage of @xcite was used to estimate bulge magnitudes .",
    "this technique has been criticized by @xcite and @xcite who suggest that it results in overestimates of @xmath2 .",
    "the present confirmation of the offset in the faber - jackson relation for seyferts using explicit bulge - disk - nucleus separation , however , suggests that while there is admittedly significant scatter , any systematic errors are small .",
    "in contrast to the @xcite result , @xcite and @xcite claim no deviation in the @xmath1   @xmath2  relation for seyfert and normal galaxies .",
    "we can reconcile this conflict by recognizing that @xcite choose to calculate @xmath1assuming a disk - like morphology and purely rotational kinematics for the blr as opposed to random orbits assumed by @xcite .",
    "thus the observed line widths depend on the orbital velocity , @xmath129 , and the inclination of the blr disk . after making assumptions about the range and mean of the distribution of inclinations",
    ", they adopt a relation between orbital velocity and the blr line widths , @xmath138 , distinctly different from the case for random cloud orbits , @xmath139 .",
    "this results in @xmath1  values that are a factor of 3 _ larger _ than the standard reverberation mapping calculations in which the blr velocity field is assumed to be random . therefore ,",
    "if we were to couple their bulge measurements with the @xmath1  values calculated assuming random blr motions , we should also get brighter bulges at a given @xmath1  for agn .",
    "of course the specific form of the blr velocity field is unknown .",
    "our results , at least for the case of random cloud motions , are consistent with an identical @xmath10 relation  for seyfert and normal galaxies , and a tendency for brighter bulges in seyferts .",
    "a different argument applies to the @xcite analysis , which assumes random motions dominate in the blr .",
    "this study reports a correlation between h@xmath119 line width and the suspected overestimate of @xmath2  resulting from the application of the @xcite @xmath140-morphology relation discussed above .",
    "this correlation is then used to correct the @xmath2  values , resulting in a reduction of the bulge luminosities for much of the sample .",
    "however , the physical link between blr kinematics and differences in @xmath140 is not established .",
    "it is therefore unclear why such a correction should be required .",
    "removing this correction from wandel s results should also result in relatively brighter bulges for agn .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of these results is that seyfert galaxies have , on average , brighter bulges as a result of lower @xmath141 ratios .",
    "thus , the difference is one of stellar population , indicating that seyferts are more likely than non - active galaxies to have had recent episodes of nuclear star formation .",
    "this is certainly plausible , given the voluminous research on the link between agn and starburst galaxies .",
    "it is informative to use model stellar populations to estimate the age and mass fraction of the bulge required to produce a brightening of this degree .",
    "guy worthey s dial - a - galaxy website @xcite allows users to mix stellar population models of different ages , metallicities , etc . , to estimate the changes to the integrated light properties of galaxy spectra .",
    "a simple run , with two solar metallicity populations of 1 gyr and 12 gyr , shows that if 15% of the total mass is from the young population the @xmath113-band magnitude will be @xmath142@xmath97@xmath143 brighter than a population composed of completely old stars .",
    "obviously more complex and realistic models could produce similar results .",
    "nevertheless , this simple estimate indicates a typical size and age for a burst of star formation to produce the shift seen in the seyfert sample .",
    "it is interesting to note that a number of recent morphological studies of seyfert galaxies have found no evidence for morphological triggers of nuclear starbursts  galaxy interactions and bars , including sub - kpc scale bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although it is conceivable that there is a time delay between a galaxy interaction and the onset of nuclear fueling , the result is troubling since we might expect at least some evidence of the disturbance to remain .",
    "a possible solution was hinted at in @xcite based on the fact that seyferts are not found outside the general envelope of scatter for normal galaxies in the faber - jackson plot .",
    "considering the residuals to the faber - jackson relation , they found that the distribution of @xmath144 is considerably narrower yet overlapping that for non - active galaxies , a detail which is reproduced in figure [ fig : fj ] . assuming that the spheriods of normal galaxies exhibit a broad range of star - formation histories , perhaps seyferts are more akin to normal spirals with above average central star formation rates than to massive starbursts initiated by strong interactions or bars .",
    "we have obtained new measurements of the bulge stellar velocity dispersion in seyfert 1 galaxies with nuclear black hole masses determined using the reverberation mapping technique .",
    "our results have shown that seyfert galaxies follow the same correlation between @xmath1and @xmath0  as for non - active galaxies and that reverberation mapping yields black hole masses which are consistent with masses determined through stellar dynamical modeling techniques .",
    "we also investigated the origin of previous assertions that the masses of black holes in active galaxies were smaller than those in normal galaxies ( or at least underestimated ) at a given bulge luminosity .",
    "we find that the best explanation is that the bulges are brighter on average in seyfert galaxies , suggesting lower @xmath141 ratios , most likely as a result of higher star formation rates in their recent history .",
    "we would like to thank the kitt peak staff for their help with the observations using the new lb1a chip .",
