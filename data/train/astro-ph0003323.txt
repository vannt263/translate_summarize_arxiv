    "advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) have been invented to explain low - luminosity black hole candidates like sgr a@xmath1 @xcite in our galactic center .",
    "the low - luminosity of this model is achieved in an optically thin plasma , where most of the energy is stored in hot ions , while electrons as potential radiators are inefficiently coupled to the heat source and remain relatively cold .",
    "the electrons become nonetheless mildly relativistic close to the central black hole and the inevitable synchrotron radiation is observed from most adaf candidates .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields not far from energy equipartition with the gas is indicative of their origin in mhd - instabilities @xcite leading to turbulence in the accretion flow and subsequent generation of an effective viscosity . on larger scales magnetic fields are likely to be responsible for the collimation of outflows from accretion disks into jets , seen in the cores of m87 @xcite and ngc 4258 @xcite , which are prototypical adaf candidates .",
    "furthermore the model can explain the accretion in some low - luminosity agns of elliptical galaxies @xcite and in ngc 4258 @xcite .",
    "in a recent x - ray survey @xcite a few more examples have been found for low - luminosity core in radio - loud agns , which are candidates for advection - dominated accretion flows in their central engines , suggesting that adafs can be found even in radio - loud agns and that jet formation is a common feature .",
    "outflow models for adafs have been investigated by @xcite and applied to several candidates @xcite . on the theoretical side @xcite and @xcite",
    "have performed time - dependent 2d calculations of accretion flows , which in some cases resemble adafs for certain viscosity parameters @xmath2 , but suggest the production of outflows for larger @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is found that the @xmath3 stress tensor component , which was not included in the original description of vertically integrated models for accretions flows , is important in the cited calculations for adafs .",
    "the existence of self - similar solutions with a radial viscous force has been shown in previous work @xcite and discussed for 2d solutions with a separation of variables .    in this paper",
    "we describe advection - dominated accretion flows in polar - integrated variables including the radial viscous braking force , which either produce outflows or are formed by wind infall .",
    "the wind infall is assumed to consist of free falling low angular momentum gas , which is cold with respect to the already existing accretion flow .",
    "one possible source for this gas are stellar winds from massive stars in young clusters as in the center of our galaxy . in the following",
    "we will refer to this wind infall into the accretion flow as infall . in our treatment the main difference between infall and outflow",
    "is the sign of the mass infall rate and we talk about winds , if it is not necessary to distinguish between infall and outflow .",
    "we restrict the discussion to an extension of the self - similar solutions given by @xcite for the newtonian limit .",
    "in  [ wo ] we present the equations , which describe the accretion flow including the reaction to winds .",
    "the role of @xmath3 stresses and bulk viscosity is emphasised .",
    "we discuss angular momentum transport and viscosity in  [ vis ] and specify the possible equations of state and the resulting energy equation in  [ equstat ] .",
    "general features of self - similar solutions are presented in ",
    "[ selfs ] and in  [ alphad ] detailed solutions for the @xmath0-viscosity law are shown .",
    "consequences of the alternative @xmath4-viscosity are discussed in  [ betadisk ] and adafs with an intermediate shear - limited viscosity law",
    "follow in  [ shearadaf ] .",
    "we compare the solutions and draw our conclusions in  [ conclud ] .",
    "in a first step we have to establish the set of equations , which describe the accretion flow .",
    "advection - dominated flows , in which we are interested , are known to be quasi - spherical @xcite and therefore we will use spherical coordinates in our discussion . consider a stationary , axisymmetric and rotating flow with angular velocity @xmath5 around a compact object of mass @xmath6 .",
    "instabilities in the flow , either hydrodynamic or magneto - hydrodynamic in origin , generate turbulence on small scales and lead to an effective viscosity much larger than the microscopic one .",
    "the effective turbulent viscosity @xmath7 in the flow will redistribute specific angular momentum @xmath8 by a local viscous torque between neighbouring rings or shells .",
    "short term evolution on scales smaller than the mean free path of eddies @xmath9 in the turbulent flow , which is related to the viscosity @xmath10 is not resolved in this description .",
    "all quantities like density or accretion velocity must be understood in a local time averaged sense with probably large short term variations . besides the time average",
    ", we will discuss accretion flows also as polar - averaged , one - dimensional flows with only a radial coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "the average is taken over sections of shells occupied by the flow .",
    "polar motions can consequently not be traced in this treatment .",
    "we are left with the angular velocity @xmath12 and the radial component of the velocity , which is the accretion velocity @xmath13 .",
    "mass is accreted by the central object with a rate @xmath14 . in this discussion @xmath15",
    "is a suitable polar integral of the density @xmath16 so that @xmath17 is the vertical thickness of the accretion flow and the integral in equation ( [ sigmaf ] ) is restricted to a region around the symmetry plane of the flow to make room for winds seen in fig.[sketch ] .",
    "nonetheless any vertical motion has a radial and polar component and the later is considered as a source or sink of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "we regard these sources as external to our description of the flow and call it infall into the accretion flow or an outflow respectively .    for a non - relativistic flow",
    "the conservation of mass implies that the change in mass flux at every radius is balanced by mass exchange with the wind in the stationary case @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass per surface area added to the flow from the infall per time at a given radius .",
    "according to equation ( [ sigmaf ] ) this happens at a height @xmath20 , but rapid mixing with the flow is assumed so that the equations averaged over polar section occupied by the accretion flow remain valid .",
    "angular momentum is a conserved quantity in accretion flows without winds and is redistributed by torques generated by viscous stresses @xmath21 @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a mass weighted polar average of @xmath24 .",
    "the infall contributes its own angular momentum to the flow @xmath25 and exerts an additional torque , which depends on the relative angular momentum of infall and flow @xmath26 .",
    "the accretion velocity @xmath27 follows from the imbalance of gravitational force , centrifugal barrier and radial pressure gradient .",
    "in addition to that we include the viscous braking force @xmath28 from the @xmath3-component of the stress tensor and bulk viscosity @xmath29 with the integrated pressure @xmath30 and the radial velocity of the wind @xmath31 , which adds its momentum to the flow .",
    "the change in specific radial momentum induced by winds is proportional to the velocity difference @xmath32 .",
    "the viscous force ( see appendix [ visf ] ) @xmath33 \\\\     \\label{fbulk } f_{\\rm bulk } & = & \\eta\\,r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\left (     \\frac{\\nu\\sigma}{r^3 }     \\frac{\\partial ( r^2 u)}{\\partial r } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has a contribution proportional the @xmath3 component of the shear tensor of the flow in equation ( [ rrshear ] ) and the compression of the gas in equation ( [ fbulk ] ) .",
    "we make the crude assumption that the corresponding viscosities are the same for the @xmath34 and @xmath3 components of the shear stress and also for the bulk viscosity .",
    "our ignorance is cast into the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which measure the strength of the @xmath3-shear and bulk viscosity relative to the familiar @xmath34-shear viscosity respectively . for isotropic turbulence @xmath37",
    "is expected , but no estimate on @xmath36 can be derived from this assumption .",
    "we will call @xmath36 and @xmath35 viscous force measures in the following .",
    "finally an energy equation must be given @xmath38 which describes the change of specific internal energy @xmath39 of the flow due to compression ( first term right side ) , viscous heating @xmath40 , radiative cooling @xmath41 , the enthalpy difference between flow @xmath42 and wind @xmath43 and the kinetic energy associated with the velocity difference , which has to be dissipated into heat . here",
    "@xmath44 is the velocity vector of the flow and @xmath45 the corresponding vector for the wind .",
    "the @xmath34 component of the stress tensor is assumed to be proportional to the corresponding component of the shear tensor with the kinematic viscosity @xmath46 as the factor of proportionality .",
    "for the viscosity @xmath7 we will adapt three different representations .",
    "the first and obvious one is the @xmath0-prescription introduced by @xcite and the resulting @xmath0-disks will be discussed in  [ alphad ] .",
    "the @xmath0-viscosity is not a unique choice and effects of the so - called @xmath4-viscosity introduced by duschl , strittmatter & biermann are discussed as @xmath4-disks in  ( [ betadisk ] ) . for the @xmath0-viscosity @xmath47 we avoided to introduce the vertical scale - height @xmath48 of the disk , because we believe that it leads to the misunderstanding that angular momentum transport in the radial direction depends on the thickness of the disk . only with the assumption of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium",
    "is it possible to introduce @xmath49 in ( [ alphvis ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-viscosity can be recovered from the @xmath4-viscosity law in the case of shock - limited turbulence in a keplerian disk .",
    "the @xmath4-viscosity assumes that a typical length scale in the direction of transport @xmath50 and the typical velocity difference @xmath51 between interacting shells , which exchange eddies , equal the mean free path of eddies and their typical velocities relative to the mean flow respectively . a parametrisation with a new constant @xmath4",
    "is suggested @xmath52 if the typical velocity of eddies in a differentially rotating disk is limited by the sound speed , than the typical length scale @xmath50 of communication between differentially rotating rings is estimated duschl et al . to be @xmath53 only in disks with keplerian rotation",
    "does this length scale equal the vertical scale - height and the form @xmath54 is recovered . as a third possibility we consider the shear - limited form of the @xmath4-viscosity with the length scale from equation ( [ lenghtnu ] ) , which has not been used for sub - keplerian accretion flows before .",
    "this is reasonable , if the mean free path of eddies is not limited by the vertical scale - height , but instead determined from the distance between shells , for which the velocity difference due to differential rotation equals the eddie velocity .",
    "this argument implies a larger effective viscosity for disks in sub - keplerian rotation .",
    "the @xmath34 component of the viscous stress tensor becomes in any case @xmath55 we assume that the same viscosity prescription can be applied to the @xmath3-component of the stress and the bulk viscosity .",
    "their relative strength is scaled to the @xmath34-viscosity by the force measures @xmath35 and @xmath36 introduced above .",
    "the heat generated by the described viscous forces has to be included in the energy equation and amounts to @xmath56 the internal energy is increased by viscous heat and compression and reduced by radiative cooling @xmath41 .",
    "in general accretion flows are expected to exist for all reasonable equations of state for the accreted gas .",
    "the self - similar solutions we will use in what follows , are restricted to rather simple equations of state . for adafs",
    "the gas should be well described by an ideal gas law with @xmath57 for ratio of specific heats , because the temperatures in adaf solutions are so large ( @xmath58k for most radii of interest ) that the gas is completely ionised and only ions of a few heavy elements retain their highly bound inner electrons ( see @xcite for possible emission lines of these elements ) .",
    "the change of the equation of state due to partial ionization can be neglected , but the contribution of magnetic to the total pressure must be considered for two reasons .",
    "the first is the observational evidence that at least some candidates ( e.g. sgr a@xmath1 , see @xcite ) for adafs show a significant contribution of synchrotron emission to the total luminosity , which requires magnetic fields close to pressure equipartition with the gas . given their existence , we might try a mhd - description of the accretion flow to separate the evolution of magnetic fields and gas , which might be different @xcite unless magnetic diffusivity @xcite and/or reconnection require an even more complex model .",
    "the easy way out is to assume that turbulence generates small scale magnetic fields , which dominate the energy density in magnetic fields and produce an isotropic contribution to total pressure and energy . in doing so , one arrives at a hydrodynamic description of the accretion flow with a equation of state , which has to incorporate the magnetic pressure .",
    "consider an equation of state of the quite general form @xmath59 with the exponents @xmath60 defined according to @xcite .",
    "for the self - similar solutions we have to restrict the internal energy per unit volume to be proportional to the total pressure @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the ratio of specific heats and @xmath63 the adiabatic coefficient defined by @xcite .",
    "the restriction from equation ( [ stricte ] ) is that @xmath60 and @xmath63 have to be constants , which requires that the relative strength of the magnetic pressure must be constant so that the effective equation of state is an ideal gas law with a ratio of specific heats less than @xmath64 .",
    "we define the isothermal sound speed @xmath65 from the integrated pressure and density .",
    "the sound speed used in the viscosity prescription is the total pressure divided by the mass density .",
    "we use thermodynamic relations @xcite to get an equation for the temperature from equation ( [ energ ] ) for stationary accretion flows @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the specific heat at constant volume @xmath68 and if we assume that gas pressure contributes a fraction @xmath69 to the total pressure and magnetic fields are responsible for the rest , we get @xmath70 for the adiabatic exponent @xmath63 which is related to @xmath71 by equation ( [ stricte ] ) . for constant @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    "we can rewrite the temperature gradient in equation ( [ temp ] ) as a gradient of the sound speed and search for solutions in terms of the sound speed .",
    "the set of equations described in  [ wo ] and  [ vis ] allow self - similar power - law solutions for accretion velocity , angular velocity and sound speed in the way @xcite have shown @xmath74 @xmath75 with the radial coordinate scaled to the gravitational radius of the central mass @xmath76 and the speed of light @xmath77 .",
    "it is required that the cooling is either completely negligible or is a radius independent fraction of the heating rate @xmath78 so that @xmath79 is the cooling efficiency , which will be small , if electrons are inefficiently coupled to the heat source .",
    "this happens , if ions are preferentially heated by viscous friction and the energy transfer rate between electrons and ions is smaller than the heating rate .    for the self - similar solution",
    "the radial component of the wind velocity must be proportional to the accretion velocity and we get a measure @xmath80 , which tells us the relative radial velocity of the wind , but we will neglect it in the following discussion and assume @xmath81 .",
    "this is motivated from the infall calculations of coker , melia & falcke ( 1999 ) , which predicts a very small radial velocity of the infalling material in the disk mid - plane for the infall from stellar winds in the galactic center . if a fraction @xmath82 larger than a few per cent of the viscously generated heat is not radiated away but kept in the flow as internal energy , the disk scale height @xmath83 is of the same order as the radius and the infall may have a significant radial velocity component .",
    "nonetheless we will neglect it in the following discussion .",
    "the same is true for the enthalpy of the infalling material , but here we have better reasons to believe that the gas joining the adaf is cold compared with the gas in the adaf , which is heated by viscous friction , while the infalling gas maybe provided by stellar winds or the gas of the hii region sgr a west in case of the galactic center with temperatures of @xmath84 k ( see @xcite for a review of the galactic center ) .",
    "this should be compared to typical temperatures of adafs of @xmath85 k at @xmath86 black hole radii .",
    "the situation with outflows might be different , where it is hard to imagine that the gas leaving the disk has a different temperature than the gas left in the flow .",
    "the gas might need some outward pointing radial momentum to get away from the adaf , but again we will ignore it here . for infalling material",
    "we expect it to be in free fall so that their total velocity is @xmath87 . in the case of outflows",
    "we require that they are able to escape the gravitational attraction of the central object and their velocity must be at least the free fall velocity @xmath88 .",
    "in the same way the rotation of the infall has to be a constant fraction @xmath89 of the rotation of the accretion flow itself and again calculations by @xcite for the galactic center predict infall with only weak rotation .",
    "outflows on the one hand might be expected to carry their initial angular momentum from the point of origin and therefore @xmath90 . on the other hand",
    "magnetically driven outflows will exert a torque on the remaining accretion flow if the gas in the outflow has different angular velocity than the point in the flow , to which it is connected by magnetic field lines . in this case",
    "@xmath91 would be expected .",
    "the rate of mass added by the infall per surface area of the flow in its central plane is constrained to steep radial profiles and introduces one free parameter @xmath92 ( blandford & begelman , 1999 ) not to be confused with the pressure @xmath93 @xmath94 for infall into accretion flows @xmath92 has to be negative and the radial dependence of the infall rate must be steeper than @xmath95 .",
    "therefore most of the mass is added at small radii and the total mass infall @xmath96 diverges in the center .",
    "this solution is consequently not valid for small radii , where the infall must deviate from the solution ( [ masswind ] ) .",
    "positive values of @xmath92 correspond to outflows generated by the accretion flow and reversing the argument for the total mass now taken away from the adaf , the solution is confined to small radii so that @xmath97 is still smaller than the mass accretion rate supplied at the outer radius .",
    "the surface density of the flow implies a density @xmath98 , which restricts the specific equation of state ( [ eqstate ] ) to those with @xmath72,@xmath73 and @xmath63 being constants and the temperature as a function of radius follows @xmath99 so that the radial pressure gradient is independent of the thermodynamic exponents and @xmath100 .",
    "the gas density in self - similar solutions for advection - dominated accretion is unconstrained and only the required inefficient cooling restricts the solutions to small mass accretion rates below @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "@xmath102 is the eddington accretion rate for an radiation efficiency of 10% in terms of the rest mass of the accreted material .",
    "whether the parametrisation of the wind , which is necessary for the self - similar solution in  [ selfs ] , is justified or not , depends on boundary conditions , which the wind has to meet at large distances , or the internal physics of outflows . while outflows might naturally follow the self - similarity of adafs , the distribution of stellar wind sources will determine , if a power - law dependence of the infall rate is reasonable .",
    "the parametrisation of the viscosity @xcite in equation ( [ alphvis ] ) is based on dimensional arguments and besides numerical simulations , which do not exist for adaf conditions , there is no way to determine what values for @xmath0 are appropriate in the case of stationary adafs . without information on the strength of the magnetic fields from mhd - calculations ,",
    "the adiabatic exponent @xmath63 is also undetermined .",
    "we will discuss the self - similar solutions as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath63 as well as for certain wind parameters and viscous force measures @xmath36 and @xmath35 .",
    "the self - similar ansatz in  [ selfs ] reduces the dynamical equations ( [ angu ] ) , ( [ acvelo ] ) and ( [ temp ] ) to a set of non - linear algebraic equations for the coefficients of sound speed @xmath103 , angular velocity @xmath104 and accretion velocity @xmath105 .",
    "the accretion velocity is derived from equation ( [ angu ] ) in terms of sound speed @xmath103 and @xmath0 @xmath106 with a constant @xmath107 , which reflects the torque exerted by the the wind on the flow .",
    "the combined wind parameter @xmath107 is 1 for a vanishing wind or a non - rotating wind . for rotating infall",
    "the solution is restricted to moderate infall rates with @xmath108 .",
    "otherwise accretion would not be possible .",
    "for a given sound speed and accretion velocity , the centrifugal barrier and therefore the angular velocity follows from the radial momentum equation ( [ acvelo ] ) , if we know the viscous force measures .",
    "we find for the square of the angular velocity ] ] @xmath109 we are left with a quadratic equation for the square of the sound speed .",
    "one solution turns out to be irrelevant either by predicting @xmath110 to be negative or leaving @xmath111 in equation([alphaom ] ) negative .",
    "but even the second root not always gives reasonable solutions , because with increasing @xmath0 and small changes in @xmath110 as seen in fig.[csalpha ] and fig.[veloalpha ] , @xmath111 decreases and becomes negative .",
    "solutions for the accretion problem exist only for values of the viscosity parameter smaller than a critical @xmath112 .",
    "the wind parameters for the solutions in fig .",
    "[ csalpha ] and [ veloalpha ] have been chosen in a way that the infall or outflow is in free fall or leaves with the escape speed .",
    "no radial momentum of the wind is included and both infall and outflow are cold .",
    "while the infall has no proper angular momentum , the outflow rotates with the @xmath5 of the accretion flow . with the requirements of a cold outflow and total velocity of the wind being the escape speed , which both enter the energy equation ( [ temp ] ) in the same way",
    ", we make a minimal energy assumption for the extraction of internal energy by the outflow . for the equation of state",
    "we take the natural choice @xmath113 so that the mix of gas and magnetic field behaves like an ideal gas .",
    "the ratio of specific heats equals @xmath63 , if we assume @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath73 is not a parameter of our solutions , but determines the actual temperature of the gas through equation ( [ temc ] ) .",
    "for energy equipartition we have @xmath115 from equation ( [ ga3 ] ) and we use this value if not stated otherwise .",
    "for the cooling efficiency @xmath79 we assume a low rate of 1% .",
    "for the dynamics of the flow not the energy radiated away matters , but the energy left in the flow .",
    "the actual cooling efficiency is unimportant as long as it is small and @xmath116 .    for an adaf without",

    "if the viscosity parameter is small , the limit @xmath120 provides a good approximation for the sound speed @xmath121 and the angular velocity @xmath122 as seen in fig.[csalpha ] and fig.[veloalpha ] . from equation ( [ alpc ] ) and",
    "( [ balc ] ) we immediately see that @xmath123 is required for the no wind case and the familiar result arises that no solution exists for a non - relativistic ideal gas .",
    "it is also obvious that the upper limit on @xmath0 increases and becomes irrelevant with vanishing radial viscous force . in other words , with increasing viscous force measures @xmath124 adaf solutions are restricted to reasonably small values of @xmath125 .",
    "one additional criterion for the realization of accretion solutions is the bernoulli number @xmath126 discussed by @xcite for adafs and @xcite for adios . while the total energy decreases inwards the bernoulli number being the total specific energy plus @xmath127 is positive and increases inwards for adafs .",
    "this changes with outflows due to their cooling effect by removing internal energy and reducing the bernoulli number of the remaining flow .",
    "correspondingly an infall increases the bernoulli number of the flow .",
    "the combinations of allowed values for @xmath0 and @xmath63 as a function of the wind strength @xmath92 is shown in fig.[gampal ] for corotating ( @xmath128 ) and non - rotating winds .",
    "the statement that adafs exist for an ideal gas with negative bernoulli numbers , if an outflow is present @xcite , is confirmed , even when the radial viscous force is included .",
    "the minimal possible wind strength depends on the viscosity parameter @xmath0 as seen in fig.[gampal ] .",

    "with infall into the flow the sound speed increases and the rotation velocity decreases .",
    "the @xmath4-viscosity law is therefore more likely to be applicable to adafs with infall than with outflows .",
    "the motivation for a shear limited viscosity law is the observation that the standard @xmath0-viscosity agrees with the general @xmath4-viscosity law only for keplerian accretion disks with a shock - limited eddy velocity . in the shear - limited viscosity @xmath152",
    "we assume that the eddy velocity is indeed shock - limited and the mean free path of eddies is determined by the radial distance of differentially rotating shells , which allows the exchange of eddies along radial paths in a comoving frame of one shell .",
    "if the eddy velocity is the sound speed , the maximal distance of shells follows from a taylor expansion of @xmath5 in @xmath51 @xmath153 the length scale over which shells can interact is larger for sub - keplerian rotation .",
    "this is the main difference of equation ( [ shearvis ] ) to the original @xmath0-viscosity .",

    "the solution disappears without a radial viscous force .",
    "the viscosity in non - rotating adafs tends to a finite value at @xmath159 @xmath160 and so does the accretion velocity .",
    "if we interpret @xmath161 as the viscous length scale , it does not diverge for small @xmath156 .",
    "the sound speed also tends to a positive value as seen in the upper solution branches for the sound speed in fig.[soundba ] and accretion velocity in fig.[modalveloo ] corresponding to the lower branches for the angular velocity in fig.[modalveloo ] .",

    "only one solution satisfies the condition @xmath162 for real values of @xmath5 .",

    "no physical solution exists for the accretion problem . besides the slowly rotating solution discussed above",

    "real solutions for the square of the sound speed in the no wind case are only possible for @xmath164 the situation does not differ from the standard @xmath0-viscosity in so far as no upper limit for @xmath156 exists in the limit of vanishing radial viscosity @xmath165 in the radial momentum equation ( [ acvelo ] ) as long as the ratio of specific heats is in the range @xmath166 . in the limit of vanishing viscosity @xmath167 the rotating solution coincides with the unique adaf solution without winds and radial viscosity .",
    "for the simplest equation of state @xmath145 the sound speed in the limit @xmath168 is @xmath169 the critical @xmath163 , which sets the upper limit for the existence of adafs with shear - limited viscosity , depends not only on the force measures @xmath170 , but also on the presence of winds .",
    "the same pattern as for the standard @xmath0-viscosity appears , in which solutions with outflows are possible for a wider range of @xmath156 than for infall solutions as seen in fig.[modalveloo ] and fig.[soundba ] .",
    "it turns out that the slowly rotating branch of solutions produces smaller bernoulli numbers than the fast rotators for infall and the no wind case @xmath171 . only for outflow solutions",
    "is the fast rotator preferred with smaller bernoulli numbers .",
    "but in all cases shown in fig.[soundba ] , the bernoulli number is positive and no gravitationally bound flow is found .",
    "this changes if more energy is extracted by the wind and the fast rotating outflow solution shown in the figures has negative bernoulli numbers , if the outflow is cold and reaches a terminal velocity equal to the escape speed at its origin .",
    "the allowed combinations of @xmath156 and @xmath63 regardless of bernoulli numbers are shown in fig.[maxalc ] .",
    "the dividing lines in the @xmath172-plane are vertical without a radial viscous force and bend in the way drawn in the figure , when the @xmath3 component of the stress tensor is included .",
    "we have investigated the importance of a radial viscous braking force for advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) in the presence of infall or outflows . under the assumption of almost isotropic turbulence , bulk viscosity and @xmath3 component of the viscous stress tensor",
    "provide an efficient brake of the rapid radial accretion of hot gas in adafs and produce additional heat due to viscous friction .",
    "this opens a second channel for transfer of kinetic into internal energy and supports in part the radial motion so that the shear due to differential rotation and the centrifugal barrier is reduced in adafs with radial viscous braking .",
    "we derived self - similar solutions of adafs for three different viscosity laws . the standard @xmath0-viscosity produces solutions , which show more and more sub - keplerian rotation with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the solutions terminate at a critical @xmath112 , which depends strongly on the ratio of specific heats so that the greatest possible @xmath0 tends to zero for a non - relativistic ideal gas . at the critical @xmath112 the rotation of the flow vanishes and a purely radial inflow appears ,",
    "which is not only supported by a pressure gradient , but also by the viscous braking force , provided the flow is still turbulent in the absence of differential rotation .",
    "this limit is reminiscent of bondi accretion @xcite in the presence of effective turbulent viscosity .",
    "the transition from adafs to bondi accretion nonetheless affords a suspicious fine tuning in @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath4-viscosity law of @xcite based on geometrical arguments in the absence of shock - limited turbulence allow adaf solutions for all reasonable values of @xmath4 .",
    "the estimates of @xmath4 as inverse of the critical reynolds number of the flow suggests small @xmath4s , for which the solutions do not differ from @xmath0-adafs .",
    "no transition to a bondi like flow is possible in this case and no upper bound on @xmath4 exists .",
    "we showed that it is possible to derive a shear - limited viscosity law from the @xmath4-viscosity mentioned above , for which the transition to non - rotating bondi like accretion with turbulent viscosity occurs naturally .",
    "the now familiar adaf solutions with sub - keplerian rotation at @xmath168 join with a second branch of solutions at a maximal sustainable @xmath156 .",
    "similar to the @xmath0-adafs no accretion flow with larger @xmath156 are possible .",
    "the second solution branch is a hot , slowly rotating , and rapidly accreting solution even for small values of @xmath156 .",
    "the transition to viscous bondi accretion occurs from the slowly rotating to the non - rotating solution in the limit @xmath168 , where @xmath5 is linear in @xmath156 .",
    "a finite viscous force is present in these flows even in the limit @xmath159 . in all cases",
    "the connection of adafs to non - rotating flows depends on the presence of a radial viscous force .",
    "the observation that adafs generally possess positive bernoulli numbers lead to the idea @xcite that adafs are good candidates for the production of outflows . in that way",
    "the accretion flow loses energy to the outflow and the remaining material is left with negative bernoulli numbers and gravitationally bound to the central accreting mass .",
    "we confirm that statement in the presence of a radial viscous force for @xmath0- and @xmath4-adafs and show the back - reaction of outflows on adafs for different outflow characteristics .",
    "most noticeably is the cooling effect and the increased accretion velocity of the remaining adaf as angular momentum and internal energy is carried away .",
    "outflows with a minimal energy assumption for the extracted energy have to be fairly massive @xmath173 to lower the bernoulli number and leave a bound flow in case of the shear - limited viscosity .",
    "it is much easier to get a bound flow , if the minimal energy assumption is violated and the terminal velocity of the outflow is the escape speed from the origin of the out - flowing material .",
    "if a natural choice of the viscosity parameter  either @xmath0 or @xmath156exists and provided the strength of the radial viscous force can be estimated from isotropic turbulence , then outflows are inevitable for certain equations of state with ratios for specific heats close to @xmath64 .",
    "this conclusion is independent of arguments based on the positiveness of bernoulli numbers for adafs .",
    "the scenario of thin disk evaporation in binary systems @xcite or the transition from cooling flows to adafs in low - luminosity cores of elliptical galaxies @xcite can explain the existence of adafs in these systems .",
    "the formation of an adaf , which is the most promising model for the spectral energy distribution of sgr a@xmath1 in the galactic center , can not proceed in either way .",
    "we suggest that an adaf in the galactic center forms out of stellar wind infall @xcite and the transfer of kinetic energy of the infall into internal energy of an advection - dominated flow .",
    "the even larger bernoulli numbers produced in this way wound give rise to subsequent outflows and reduce the mass accretion rate inferred from infall calculations by @xcite to the smaller accretion rates predicted from spectral fitting @xcite of adaf models to sgr a@xmath1 .",
