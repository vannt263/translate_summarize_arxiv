    "the temperature dependence of the r@xmath10(t , @xmath5h@xmath16 t ) in the paramagnetic phase of ndb@xmath0 ( fig.4b ) contradicts to the low field hall effect data obtained in @xcite .",

    "therefore our data do not confirm earlier observed hall coefficient anomaly at t@xmath52t@xmath33 @xcite ( fig.5a ) and it makes questionable also the interpretation in terms of the anomalous hall effect in the paramagnetic phase of ndb@xmath0 proposed in @xcite .",
    "the transition to af state is accompanied by a different variation of the low field hall coefficient in prb@xmath0 and ndb@xmath0 .",

    "the contribution of @xmath72 is very small as compared to the first harmonic .",

    "indeed , a pronounced increase of the @xmath72(t ) values in prb@xmath0 is accompanied by broadening of the peak in magnetic field ( fig.6a ) . on the contrary , for ndb@xmath0 the @xmath72(t ) maximum value decreases evidently for @xmath5h@xmath95 t ( see ,",
    "e.g. , data for @xmath5h@xmath96 t in fig.6b ) .",
    "interesting that noticeable anomalies of both magnetoresistance @xcite and c@xmath97 elastic constant @xcite temperature dependencies have been earlier detected in the vicinity of temperature t@xmath98 for ndb@xmath0 .",
    "these features at t@xmath94k may indicate on the possible changes of electronic and/or magnetic structure occurred in the commensurate af phase of ndb@xmath0 well below the neel temperature .",
    "however , a detailed investigation of magnetic and charge transport parameters of ndb@xmath0 need to be carried out to shed more light on the origin of the hall effect anomalies observed at t@xmath98 in af phase of ndb@xmath0 .",
    "high accuracy of data obtained allows us to estimate the number of conduction electrons per unit cell in the paramagnetic phase of rare earth hexaborides under investigation .",
    "the values n / n@xmath99(prb@xmath100 and n / n@xmath99(ndb@xmath101 , which are established just above the neel temperature ( at @xmath54k ) in these magnetic hexaborides , are comparable with charge carriers concentration previously estimated for ceb@xmath0 ( n / n@xmath102 @xcite ) .",
    "an approximately linear increase of n / n@xmath99 parameter vs @xmath23-shell occupation in the magnetic hexaborides agrees well with the results obtained in @xcite , where a remarkable expansion of the small fs electron pockets was detected in the light rb@xmath0 compounds .",
    "the increase of n / n@xmath99 produced by fs changes is a factor , which is responsible for a variation of both rkky - function @xmath103f(@xmath1k@xmath104r@xmath105 ) ( here k@xmath104 and r@xmath105 denote fermi wavevector and the distance between the magnetic moments of the rare earth ions , respectively ) and indirect exchange interaction . according to de gennes approach @xcite , the neel temperature t@xmath33 , reduced concentration n / n@xmath99 , exchange constant j@xmath106 , fermi energy e@xmath104",

    "indeed , the pronounced lowering of rkky - function was predicted for rb@xmath0 compounds when the n / n@xmath99 ratio increases in the range @xmath115 @xcite , but more detailed calculations are necessary to estimate quantitatively the variation of t@xmath33 in the rare earth hexaborides family .",
    "when discussing the complicated behavior of hall effect in af phases of prb@xmath0 and ndb@xmath0 ( see sections @xmath116 ) it is worth to mention that the magnetic structures of prb@xmath0 and ndb@xmath0 have different parameters in low magnetic field region . the magnetic unit cell of prb@xmath0",
    "c - phase involves @xmath117 structural unit cells @xcite and characterizes by a wave vector * * q**@xmath118 while simple doubling of the structural unit cell is observed in ndb@xmath0 @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the structure of prb@xmath0 commensurate c@xmath10 magnetic phase formed in moderate magnetic fields ( fig.1a ) is similar to that one of commensurate af phase observed in ndb@xmath0 in magnetic fields below @xmath31 t @xcite . in this respect",
    "the dramatic change of hall coefficient r@xmath10 found in prb@xmath0 with the increase of magnetic field from @xmath119 t to @xmath20 t ( fig.4a ) may be definitely associated with the crossing of the c - c@xmath10 phase boundary below t@xmath93 .    to obtain more information about the variation of hall coefficient when entering from c to c@xmath10 phases of prb@xmath0 , the magnetic field dependencies of r@xmath10(h , t@xmath120 )",
    "have been obtained from the experimental data for fixed temperatures t@xmath121t@xmath93 in the range @xmath5h@xmath122 t .",

    "so , the similar behaviour of the hall coefficient temperature dependencies for prb@xmath0 at t@xmath2t@xmath93 ( see data for @xmath5h@xmath59 t in fig.5a ) and for ndb@xmath0 at t@xmath2t@xmath33 ( fig.5b ) may be likely understood assuming identical magnetic structures ( simple type i antiferromagnet with ordering vector * * q**@xmath123 ) developing in the af phase of ndb@xmath0 ( fig.1b ) and in the c@xmath10-phase of prb@xmath0 ( fig.1a ) .",
    "the strong renormalization of the hall coefficient r@xmath10(t ) in the commensurate phases of the studied antiferromagnets ( figs.5,7 ) may be attributed to the reconstruction of fs below the af phase transition .",
    "the electronic structure of the af state in these hexaborides may be properly understood through folding of the paramagnetic band structure .",
    "following to the fs reconstruction of @xcite , the simple cubic brillouin zone in the paramagnetic state of rb@xmath0 is reduced by this folding procedure to the tetragonal one in the af phase of ndb@xmath0 . as a result , two kinds of electron sheets and one hole sheet appear in the af phase of ndb@xmath0 causing to the remarkable changes in the hall coefficient behaviour with temperature both in weak and strong magnetic field regimes .",
    "however , the independent verification of this scenario requires a comparative study of hall effect and magnetization to be carried out in strong enough magnetic fields .",
    "the resistivity ( fig.2 ) and hall effect ( fig.4 ) data were used to estimate hall mobility @xmath51(t)@xmath124r@xmath10(t)@xmath125(t ) for prb@xmath0 and ndb@xmath0 ( inset in fig.2 ) . in commensurate af phases of these compounds hall mobility gets values @xmath51(prb@xmath126 cm@xmath108/(v@xmath128s ) and @xmath51(ndb@xmath129 cm@xmath108/(v@xmath128s ) . in paramagnetic state in the range @xmath130k@xmath8t@xmath83k the @xmath51(t ) curves could be well fitted by the power law dependence @xmath131t@xmath53 with the exponents @xmath132(prb@xmath133 and @xmath132(ndb@xmath134 ( inset in fig.2 ) .",

    ", the remarkable changes of the hall coefficient in magnetic field observed in the present study for lab@xmath0 and ndb@xmath0 ( fig .",

    "the strong enough variation of r@xmath10(h , @xmath142k ) ( by @xmath143 ) could be certainly attributed to transition from weak ( @xmath144 , where and are cyclotron frequency and charge carriers relaxation time , correspondingly ) to strong ( @xmath145 ) magnetic field regime @xcite .",
    "however , rather low mobility of charge carriers in ndb@xmath0 does nt allow to interpret the drastic changes of r@xmath10(h ) observed in the af phase of ndb@xmath0 ( see , e.g. , curve for t@xmath146k in fig.7b ) in terms of the @xmath147 approach .",
    "to explain the anomalous behaviour of hall coefficient in the studied rare earth hexaborides it is necessary to address to the results of transverse magnetoresistance study performed recently for these compounds @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown @xcite that nanoscale magnetic clusters with strongly renormalized effective magnetic moments @xmath148(prb@xmath149 and @xmath148(ndb@xmath150 are formed just above the neel temperature in these compounds ( see also @xmath148(t ) curves in fig.6 ) . the unit cell magnetic clusters formation attributed to the exchange induced @xmath22-states spin polarization @xcite was proposed to be responsible both for the effects of density - of - states renormalization and the formation of additional @xmath22-component in the magnetic structure of these unusual antiferromagnets .",
    "in such a case the interaction between the spin polarized component of @xmath22-states and the magnetic structure of @xmath23 magnetic moments in the rare earth hexaborides under investigation could be considered as an important reason resulting both in the appearance of the magnetic anisotropy in af - phase @xcite and in the noticeable renormalization of hall effect observed just below t@xmath33 in rb@xmath0 under investigation ( fig.4 ) .",
    "to summarize , the hall effect in the antiferromagnetic metals prb@xmath0 and ndb@xmath0 has been studied at temperatures in the range @xmath151k in magnetic fields up to @xmath4 t . the detailed comparison between the r@xmath10(t ) temperature dependencies obtained in present investigation and those ones reported earlier in @xcite allows establishing temperature independent behaviour of r@xmath10(t ) in paramagnetic state of these two rb@xmath0 compounds excluding the interpretation @xcite in terms of anomalous paramagnetic hall effect in ndb@xmath0 . within the analysis based on the de gennes approach an essential decrease of rkky - function amplitude from prb@xmath0 to ndb@xmath0 is suggested to be the main reason of the close magnitudes of neel temperatures in these magnetic hexaborides with very different values of the de gennes factors .",
