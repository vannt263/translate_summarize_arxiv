    "harvesting is an appealing technique that will help solve energy - constrained problems of wireless networks since it can virtually provide perpetual energy supply without manual battery recharging or replacement . in particular ,",
    "radio - frequency ( rf ) energy harvesting @xcite is more flexible and sustainable than conventional solar or wind energy harvesting since more and more wireless transmitters are deployed and the rf signals radiated by ambient transmitters are consistently available . although the energy provided by non - intended energy harvesting is still limited , it is enough for low - power networks , such as sensor networks @xcite . for high - power networks with more energy requirements , intended power beacons ( pbs )",
    "are designed for wireless energy transfer ( wet ) @xcite , @xcite and wireless powered communication networks ( wpcns ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) is studied when the information receiver and the energy receiver are separated in different terminals or co - located in the same terminal @xcite .    when energy harvesting is adopted in cognitive radio networks ( crns ) , namely energy harvesting crns ( eh - crns ) , the rf signals radiated by the primary users ( pus ) are no longer interference for the secondary users ( sus ) , but can be regarded as a green energy source for energy harvesting . in this way , sus can utilize both the spectrum and the energy of pus .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study a green coexistence paradigm for pus and sus to enhance spectrum efficiency and green energy utilization simultaneously .    to be specific",
    ", we consider an underlay eh - crn with battery - free sus that perform multi - hop transmission to lower their transmit powers . by time",
    "division multiple access ( tdma ) , each su on the multi - hop path first harvests energy from the rf signals of primary transmitter ( pt ) and then transmits in the allocated time sequentially , both in the licensed spectrum .",
    "the harvested energy is transiently kept by a supercapacitor which has the characteristics of small form factor and fast charge - discharge @xcite . however , due to the leakage of supercapacitor and the absence of energy storage or management , the possible remaining energy or the harvested energy after transmission can not be used in the next communication cycle .",
    "thus , the available energy for each su is mainly determined by the energy harvested before transmission , which is termed as energy causality @xcite . in this way , the transmit powers of sus are subject to not only the interference power constraint of primary receiver ( pr ) as in conventional underlay crns , but also the energy causality constraint imposed by energy harvesting .",
    "typical applications of this eh - crn can be cognitive radio sensor networks , in which each su is a cognitive sensor that transmits data via multiple hops to the sink .    with the formulated green coexistence paradigm",
    ", we investigate optimal resource allocation for end - to - end throughput maximization .",
    "specifically , by taking into account the energy causality constraint and the interference power constraint , we formulate an end - to - end throughput maximization problem with respect to time and power allocation .",
    "however , this is a nonconvex problem .",
    "thus , we first transform it into an equivalent yet convex optimization problem , and then propose the joint optimal time and power allocation ( jotpa ) algorithm to solve it .",
    "the jotpa algorithm decomposes the transformed problem into a series of feasibility problems , each with a given end - to - end throughput , and iteratively solves them by the dual decomposition method until the end - to - end throughput achieves the maximum . to evaluate the performance of the eh - crn with jotpa",
    ", we design three typical scenarios for the deployments of eh - crn and compare jotpa with two other resource allocation algorithms , namely optimal time and equal power allocation ( otepa ) and equal time and optimal power allocation ( etopa ) .",
    "the major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * first , different from conventional crns that take pt as interference or even ignore pt for simplicity , this paper regards pt as a friend that provides both spectrum and energy for sus . in doing so",
    ", we investigate a novel green coexistence paradigm to enhance spectrum efficiency and green energy utilization .",
    "moreover , this paradigm can be regarded as another type of swipt where pr is the information receiver and sus are the energy receivers . *",
    "second , subject to the energy causality constraint and the interference power constraint , we study the end - to - end throughput maximization problem with respect to time and power allocation and propose the jotpa algorithm to obtain the optimal solution . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the optimal resource allocation for the end - to - end throughput maximization of underlay multi - hop en - crns has not been studied before . * third , by moving the eh - crn around pus , we investigate three typical scenarios to show how the deployments of eh - crn influence the performance , which can guide us to deploy the eh - crn properly .",
    "moreover , to validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm , we compare jotpa with otepa and etopa , and demonstrate that jotpa gains larger end - to - end throughput and higher green energy utilization than otepa and etopa under all considered scenarios .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the related works on eh - crns .",
    "section iii presents the green coexistence paradigm of underlay multi - hop eh - crns .",
    "section iv first formulates and transforms the end - to - end throughput maximization problem , and then proposes the jotpa algorithm to solve it .",
    "extensive simulation results are presented and analyzed in section v , and conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "to exploit the spectrum and the energy of pus , sus in eh - crns can operate in three kinds of paradigms , namely , interweave , overlay and underlay @xcite .    in interweave paradigms ,",
    "sus first harvest energy and then opportunistically access the licensed spectrum when pus are detected as inactive . in @xcite ,",
    "spectrum sensing is optimized to maximize the throughput when sus harvest energy from ambient energy sources . then , a two - dimensional spectrum and power sensing scheme is proposed for the case that both pus and sus harvest energy from the same renewable source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a spectrum access scheme is proposed for throughput maximization in @xcite , in which sus harvest energy from the active pus . in @xcite ,",
    "throughput and outage probability are derived for the case that sus opportunistically harvest energy from the nearby pus .",
    "in overlay paradigms , sus consume energy to serve both pus and sus provided that there are excellent cooperations between pus and sus . in @xcite , @xcite , throughput maximization is studied for the case that one su harvests energy from ambient rf signals , serves as the relay for pus , and communicates with another su . after extending one su to multiple sus , relay selection to maximize throughput or sum - throughput",
    "is investigated in @xcite , @xcite , wherein sus harvest from pus or a hybrid access point ( h - ap ) . in @xcite , sum - throughput maximization",
    "is studied for overlay eh - crns , wherein first h - ap performs wet for multiple sus as well as information transmission for pus , and then collects data from sus .",
    "similarly , energy efficiency maximization is studied in @xcite , wherein uplink scheduling and cooperative power control are considered .    in underlay",
    "paradigms , sus transmit with the harvested energy as long as the interference to pus does not exceed a tolerable threshold . in @xcite , sum - throughput maximization",
    "is also studied for underlay eh - crns , wherein both wet and information transmission are performed concurrently with pus . for the case that sus harvest energy from pus",
    ", throughput is optimized under the outage constraint of pus @xcite and the interference power constraint of pus @xcite .",
    "moreover , outage probability is derived for the case that sus harvest energy from pus @xcite or other sus @xcite .",
    "recently , outage minimization is studied for the case that sus harvest energy from pb @xcite . for hybrid interweave and underlay eh - crns ,",
    "the throughput defined in terms of outage probability is optimized in @xcite .    by comparing the above paradigms",
    ", we can observe that all the harvested energy in underlay eh - crns can be utilized for self - sustainability while much of the harvested energy must be spent on the spectrum sensing in interweave eh - crns or the cooperation with pus in overlay eh - crns .",
    "moreover , as underlay eh - crns enable the coexistence of pus and sus and are mostly applied when pus always exist , sus can take pus as a stable green energy source for sustainable energy harvesting . in this way",
    ", sus can capture the spectrum and the energy of pus simultaneously .",
    "motivated by the above analysis , we study underlay eh - crns to enhance spectrum efficiency and green energy utilization .",
    "although a few of the aforementioned works have already studied underlay eh - crns , they individually focus on different problems . to summarize , @xcite@xcite investigate the throughput maximization of single - hop eh - crns , while @xcite , @xcite analyze the outage performance of dual - hop eh - crns .",
    "in contrast , this paper studies the end - to - end throughput maximization of multi - hop eh - crns . moreover , different from our recent work @xcite studying end - to - end outage minimization of multi - hop eh - crns with intended wet , this paper studies end - to - end throughput maximization by exploiting green energy .",
    "in addition , although other recent works @xcite@xcite studying wet , wpcns or swipt can provide on - demand energy by proper antenna or waveform design and power control , spectrum efficiency and green energy utilization are ignored .",
    "in contrast , both issues are taken into account in this paper , wherein the eh - crns completely lives on pus whose setup is prescribed without being influenced by the eh - crns .",
    "as depicted in fig . [ fig1 ] , an underlay multi - hop eh - crn with @xmath0 sus denoted as @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , coexists with a pair of pus , namely pt and pr .",
    "pt is always active in the licensed spectrum to serve pr , and shares the spectrum with sus under the prescribed interference power constraint @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all sus are battery - free without energy storage or management .",
    "meanwhile , sus do not equipped with any constant energy supplies , but can harvest energy from the rf signals of pt .",
    "consequently , sus live on pus , indicating that the eh - crn is completely powered by green energy .",
    "however , as non - intended energy harvesting provides limited energy , we employ multi - hop transmission to lower the transmit powers of sus . to support the multi - hop transmission , tdma with perfect time synchronization @xcite",
    "is adopted for the transmission from the source @xmath3 to the destination @xmath4 , wherein decode - and - forward ( df ) is adopted for relaying .",
    "furthermore , only one data flow is considered on the multi - hop path to ensure that each su is allocated with enough energy harvesting time to support its transmission .        with tdma ,",
    "a frame with duration @xmath5 is slotted and allocated to sus for the @xmath6-hop transmission as shown in fig .",
    "the data transmission time allocated to @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) is denoted as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the total allocated time must satisfy @xmath10 where @xmath11 is designed for the energy harvesting of the source @xmath3 .",
    "it is obvious that the multi - hop transmission can be reduced to a single - hop transmission .",
    "each su with one single antenna operates in half - duplex such that it can only transmit or receive at one time . in this way",
    ", each su works in the harvest - then - transmit fashion",
    ". specifically , @xmath1 continuously harvests energy from pt before its turn to transmit , wherein the harvested energy is transiently kept in a supercapacitor .",
    "supercapacitor has the advantages of small form factor and fast charging with theoretically infinite recharge cycles , since it can be trickle - charged by rf signals without complex charging circuitry and has high charge - discharge efficiency without suffering from memory effect @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , supercapacitor also suffers from high self - discharge .",
    "thus , due to the leakage of supercapacitor and the absence of energy storage or management , it is reasonable to assume that the possible remaining energy or the energy harvested after transmission in one frame can not be utilized in the next frame . in this way",
    ", the available energy for each su in one frame completely depends on the harvested energy before the turn to transmit , namely energy causality .",
    "the energy harvesting time for @xmath1 is calculated as @xmath12 . obviously , the latter sus on the multi - hop path have more time for energy harvesting than the former sus .",
    "the harvested energy of @xmath1 , denoted as @xmath13 , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the transmit power of pt , @xmath16 is the channel power gain for the energy link from pt to @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath17 is the energy harvesting efficiency decided by the design of energy harvester , and @xmath18 is assumed for convenience .",
    "note that ( [ equ(3 ) ] ) ignores the noise energy as it is too small to contribute to the overall harvested energy .    with the harvested energy ,",
    "@xmath1 transmits data to @xmath19 in the allocated transmission time @xmath8 concurrently with pt in the licensed spectrum .",
    "the received signal @xmath20 at @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at @xmath19 . without loss of generality",
    ", we assume the noise powers at all sus are the same , i.e. , @xmath23 . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the signals of pt and @xmath1 , wherein @xmath24 fulfilling @xmath26=1 $ ] and @xmath25 fulfilling @xmath27=1 $ ] are uncorrelated signals .",
    "thus , @xmath24 is converted into energy by the rf - dc circuit while @xmath25 is decoded and forwarded by @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath28 is the channel power gain for the data link from @xmath1 to @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath29 is the transmit power of @xmath1 and must be strictly controlled such that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the peak interference power that pr can tolerate , and @xmath32 is the channel power gain for the interference link from @xmath1 to pr .    by taking into account the effects of both large scale path loss and small scale channel fading , we have the channel power gain coefficients as @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the corresponding channel gain and distance , @xmath37 is the reference distance and @xmath38 is the path loss exponent .",
    "the channels follow quasi - static block fading ( i.e. , the channels remain constant during each block transmission but may change from one block to another ) , and one block fading coincides with a single frame .",
    "we assume that sus can perfectly evaluate the channel state information ( csi ) by channel training and estimation , pilot sensing , direct feedbacks from pus and sus , or even indirect feedbacks from a band manager at the beginning of each block @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this section , we investigate the end - to - end throughput maximization problem for optimal resource allocation in the underlay multi - hop eh - crn .      with the harvested energy @xmath13 and the allocated transmission time @xmath8 , the achievable throughput for the @xmath39-th hop transmission from @xmath1 to @xmath19 is calculated as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at @xmath19 .",
    "note that the signal of pt is no longer regarded as interference but is converted into energy .",
    "as the throughput of multi - hop transmission is dominated by the bottleneck link , the end - to - end throughput of the underlay multi - hop eh - crn is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] are the vectors of time allocation and power allocation , respectively .",
    "as the end - to - end throughput @xmath45 is a function of both the allocated time @xmath46 and the allocated power @xmath47 , we formulate the following optimization problem with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 to maximize @xmath45 : @xmath48    in problem ( [ equ(7 ) ] ) , @xmath49 indicates that , with the allocated time and power , the allocated energy for each su can not exceed the harvested energy in a frame ; @xmath50 indicates that the peak interference power at pr can not exceed the tolerable threshold @xmath31 .",
    "that is to say , the transmit power of each su is constrained by the energy causality constraint and the interference power constraint .",
    "moreover , @xmath51 is the total allocated time constraint as ( [ equ(1 ) ] ) , while @xmath52 is the allocated time constraint for each su .",
    "problem ( [ equ(7 ) ] ) is a max - min optimization problem , which maximizes the minimum throughput on the multi - hop path .",
    "however , problem ( [ equ(7 ) ] ) is nonconvex since there is the product of optimization variables @xmath8 and @xmath29 in @xmath49 . to make problem ( [ equ(7 ) ] ) tractable , we introduce new optimization variables @xmath53 ( @xmath7 ) and transform the problem into the following problem with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 $ ] is the vector of the allocated energy for the transmission of each hop .",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 is defined for convenience , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are equivalent to @xmath51 and @xmath52 in problem ( [ equ(7 ) ] ) , respectively .    * _ proposition 1 : _ * the end - to - end throughput @xmath60 is a jointly concave function of @xmath46 and @xmath54 .    * _ proof : _ * please refer to appendix a. @xmath61    according to proposition 1 , the objective function in problem ( [ equ(7 ) ] ) with respect to @xmath62 is reformulated as a concave function of @xmath63",
    ". meanwhile , with the help of @xmath54 , the energy causality constraint @xmath49 is also converted into an affine constraint as @xmath64 .",
    "thus , problem ( [ equ(8 ) ] ) is a convex optimization problem that can be solved by the convex optimization techniques @xcite . in this way , the original nonconvex optimization problem ( [ equ(7 ) ] ) with respect to time and power allocation is equivalently converted into a convex optimization problem ( [ equ(8 ) ] ) with respect to time and energy allocation .",

    "for the same @xmath6 , it is obvious that @xmath143 of scenario 1 or 2 is larger than that of scenario 3 . to explain this phenomenon , we should be aware of the following two facts .",
    "first , in one block fading , the harvested energies of sus are significantly influenced by the path loss , as a result of which sus close to pt can harvest more energy .",
    "second , the harvested energy is monotonically increasing with the increase of energy harvesting time , as a result of which the latter sus on the multi - hop path can harvest more energy . in scenario 1 , although the latter sus suffer from larger path loss than the former sus , they have more energy harvesting time , which can compensate the impact of path loss . however , in scenario 3 , the latter sus suffer from smaller path loss but have more energy harvesting time than the former sus , which causes the unbalance of the harvested energies among sus and further the phenomenon that @xmath143 of scenario 3 is smaller than that of scenario 1 .",
    "note that scenario 2 is a compromise of scenario 1 and scenario 3 , as a result of which @xmath143 of scenario 2 is also larger than that of scenario 3 .    to help understand the above analysis",
    ", we further depict fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] to present the allocated time , the allocated energy and the harvested energy for the six - hop eh - crn selected from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . obviously , the energy distribution of scenario 1 is much more balanced than that of scenario 3 , in which the harvested energy is monotonically increasing .",
    "moreover , from scenarios 1 to 3 , the allocated energy and the harvested energy at @xmath3 are decreasing while those at @xmath144 are increasing .",
    "these observations are all consistent with the previous analysis for fig .",
    "in addition , from @xmath3 to @xmath144 , the allocated transmission time in scenario 1 is approximate due to the well - balanced energy distribution , while that in scenario 3 is decreasing even though more energy is harvested .     versus @xmath6 for different scenarios : @xmath136 db , @xmath145 db , height=226 ]    .",
    "[ fig5 ]    another significant observation in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is that all the harvested energies of sus are allocated .",
    "this is because the interference power constraint of pr is so slack that sus can consume all the harvested energies to maximize the throughput .",
    "therefore , we restrict the interference power constraint of pr to a strict level as @xmath145 db in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . obviously , the throughput gaps between the three scenarios are enlarged , wherein @xmath143 of scenario 1 is the largest and @xmath143 of scenario 3 is the smallest .",
    "this is because only a small part of the harvested energies can be allocated for transmission as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , while the remaining part will be discharged due to the leakage of supercapacitors .",
    "thus , we can conclude that when the interference power constraint of pr is strict , the scenario in which former sus are close to pt can benefit more from the green energy and achieve larger end - to - end throughput than the scenario in which latter sus are close to pt .    by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig3][fig6 ] , we can observe that the interference power constraint of pr significantly influences the end - to - end throughput .",
    "to clearly present the relationship between @xmath143 and @xmath31 , we depict fig . [ fig7 ] for scenario 2 which employs symmetrical deployment and is selected without loss of generality . as shown , when @xmath31 is small ( e.g. , @xmath146 db ) , @xmath143 is almost zero since even small transmit powers of sus will cause intolerable interference to pr .",
    "thus , only a small amount of the harvested energies are utilized for transmission .",
    "then , with the increase of @xmath31 ( i.e. , the interference power constraint of pr is slackened ) , more of the harvested energies can be utilized for transmission and @xmath143 is enhanced correspondingly . however , when @xmath31 is sufficiently large , @xmath143 can not be further enhanced since the harvested energies by sus are limited for the given @xmath15 . for this case ,",
    "the eh - crn is equivalent to the wpcn without cognitive radio . for the general case",
    ", we set @xmath147 db in the following simulations .",
    "versus @xmath31 for different numbers of hops : @xmath136 db.,height=226 ]      in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we compare jotpa with otepa and etopa for three - hop eh - crns with different energy harvesting efficiencies deployed in scenario 2 .",
    "it is obvious that jotpa gains larger @xmath143 than otepa and etopa for the same @xmath148 .",
    "the reasons are explained as follows .",
    "first , although otepa performs optimal time allocation , it does not allocate powers according to csi and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , sus can not enhance their transmit powers adaptively even if the harvested energies are sufficient .",
    "second , as the allocated time by etopa is not optimized , the harvested energies for some sus are not enough to reach the maximum available transmit powers constrained by @xmath31 , while for other sus are so much that can not be utilized but discharged .",
    "however , no matter which algorithm is employed , @xmath143 always increases with the increase of @xmath15 or @xmath148 since more energies can be harvested and utilized for transmission under the constraint of the same @xmath31 . moreover",
    ", the throughput gaps from otepa and etopa to jotpa are enlarging with the increase of @xmath15 , which validates the superiority of the proposed jotpa algorithm .     versus @xmath15 for different algorithms : @xmath147 db , @xmath149.,height=226 ]    more specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] compares the energy statuses of sus in three - hop eh - crns with different resource allocation algorithms .",
    "it is observed that the harvested energies of sus by etopa are much smaller than those by jotpa and otepa , wherein the harvested energies by jotpa and otepa are the same as their time allocations are optimized by the same method .",
    "however , the total allocated energies of all sus by otepa and etopa are much smaller than that by jotpa .",
    "thus , we can conclude that jotpa outperforms otepa and etopa in green energy utilization .    in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we compare the three algorithms for the eh - crns with different numbers of hops . for any @xmath6 ,",
    "when @xmath38 is small , jotpa always obtains much larger @xmath143 than those by otepa and etopa .",
    "however , when @xmath38 increases , @xmath143 decreases quickly and the superiority of jotpa decreases .",
    "this is because when the path loss becomes severe , no matter which algorithm is employed , both the energies harvested by transmitters and the information correctly decoded by receivers become scarce .    to overcome the influence of path loss ,",
    "multi - hop transmission is an efficient method , as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , wherein @xmath143 increases with the increase of @xmath6 .",
    "however , @xmath6 can not be arbitrarily increased as the throughput gain is not always increasing in @xmath6 . for example , when @xmath137 , the throughput gain of jotpa from @xmath149 to @xmath150 is 23.72% , while that from @xmath150 to @xmath151 is only 10.86% .",
    "similar observations can also be obtained from figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "the reason is that a frame is divided by @xmath6 and a large @xmath6 leads to small @xmath8 , which decreases @xmath45 as @xmath152 and @xmath153 monotonically increases in @xmath8 .",
    "we can consider an extreme case when @xmath154 resulting in @xmath155 , there must be @xmath156 .",
    "thus , too large @xmath6 can not benefit more @xmath143 , which motivates us to set @xmath6 properly .",
    "however , the optimal @xmath6 can not be calculated by a closed - form expression .",
    "instead , we can obtain the optimal @xmath6 by a one - dimensional search as @xmath6 is a finite integer .",
    "versus @xmath38 for different algorithms : @xmath136 db , @xmath147 db , height=226 ]    .",
    "in this paper , we formulated a green coexistence paradigm for underlay multi - hop eh - crns , in which battery - free sus capture both the spectrum and the energy of pus to enhance spectrum efficiency and green energy utilization . with this paradigm",
    ", we investigated the end - to - end throughput maximization problem subject to the energy causality constraint and the interference power constraint , and proposed the jotpa algorithm to achieve optimal resource allocation . by moving the multi - hop eh - crns around pus",
    ", we observed that deploying the former sus close to pus can achieve larger end - to - end throughput and higher green energy utilization than deploying the latter sus close to pus .",
    "moreover , by making comparisons among three different resource allocation algorithms , we concluded that jotpa obtains larger end - to - end throughput and higher green energy utilization than etopa and otepa under all considered scenarios .",
    "this paper provides a lower - bound for the performance of multi - hop eh - crns in underlay paradigm , as energy storage and management are inapplicable for the battery - free sus .",
    "future works considering energy storage and management will further improve the performance .",
    "furthermore , it will be necessary to study advanced energy management schemes to cope with the dynamics of pus if the multi - hop eh - crns work in interweave , overlay or even hybrid paradigm .",
    "for the @xmath39-hop transmission , the achievable throughput @xmath157 given in problem ( [ equ(8 ) ] ) is the perspective of a function @xmath158 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath159 is a concave function of @xmath110 since logarithmic function is concave .",
    "as the perspective operation preserves convexity @xcite , @xmath157 is jointly concave in @xmath8 and @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , the end - to - end throughput @xmath60 is a jointly concave function of @xmath46 and @xmath54 as @xmath160 is the pointwise minimum of @xmath6 concave functions @xmath157 s .",
    "the proof of proposition 1 is thus completed .",
    "for notational convenience , we denote the throughput of each hop as @xmath161 instead of @xmath157 in this proof .",
    "first , we study the relationship between @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the partial derivative of @xmath161 with respect to @xmath8 is given by @xmath163 it can be verified that @xmath164 , which means that @xmath161 monotonically increases in @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , @xmath161 also monotonically increases in @xmath110 .",
    "note that @xmath110 is further constrained by the allocated time @xmath165 $ ] according to @xmath64 and @xmath92 in problem ( [ equ(8 ) ] ) .",
    "thus , for given @xmath166 $ ] , if @xmath8 is increased , @xmath110 can also be enhanced , which further improves @xmath161 .",
    "obviously , adjusting ( e.g. , increasing or decreasing ) @xmath8 should adjust @xmath110 at the same time under the constraints @xmath64 and @xmath92 .",
    "then , we prove that @xmath167 holds for any @xmath46 satisfying @xmath168 . considering a general case that each hop obtains a different throughput , we can sort them in an ascending order as @xmath169 without loss of generality .",
    "thus , the end - to - end throughput constrained by the bottleneck is @xmath170 . as @xmath161 ( @xmath7 ) increases in @xmath8 and @xmath110 monotonically , by increasing ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 ) and decreasing ( @xmath173 , @xmath174 )",
    ", we can achieve @xmath175 , which improves the end - to - end throughput to @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "furthermore , by adjusting @xmath178 $ ] and @xmath179 $ ] , we can obtain @xmath180 , which enhances the end - to - end throughput as @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) . repeating the above process",
    ", we can improve the end - to - end throughput step by step until @xmath167 which can not be further enhanced .",
    "thus , for the given @xmath46 , we can achieve the maximum end - to - end throughput by adjusting ( @xmath46,@xmath54 ) such that each su obtains the same throughput .",
    "finally , we prove that @xmath183 holds for the maximum end - to - end throughput @xmath67 .",
    "assuming @xmath184 that satisfies @xmath185 and obtains @xmath186 , we have @xmath187 and further @xmath188 according to @xmath64 and @xmath92 . as @xmath189 is monotonically increasing in @xmath190 and @xmath191 , there must be @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is obtained with ( @xmath194 , @xmath195 ) .",
    "then , we can always obtain a higher end - to - end throughput by adjusting @xmath46 and @xmath54 as before .",
    "the above process continues until @xmath183 , which results in @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath196 , @xmath197 is a feasible solution for problem ( [ equ(10 ) ] ) , then @xmath198 holds for @xmath7 . as @xmath85",
    ", it is obvious that @xmath199 by ( [ equ(11 ) ] ) , and @xmath86 as @xmath88 is the minimum of all @xmath200 by ( [ equ(12 ) ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the  if \" part of proposition 3 .",
    "then , we prove the  only if \" part by contradiction .",
    "we assume that @xmath196 , @xmath197 is a feasible solution for problem ( [ equ(10 ) ] ) and there exists @xmath85 satisfying @xmath201 .",
    "thus , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , which conflicts with the assumption that @xmath201 .",
    "this completes the  only if \" part of proposition 3 .",
    "as problem ( [ equ(13 ) ] ) is a convex optimization problem , there is strong duality between the primal problem and the dual problem by slater s condition .",
