    "controlled transport of atoms stored in optical lattices is a central process in the quest for coherent atom - atom interactions .",
    "such interactions are at the heart of creating and manipulating quantum multi - particle systems for , _ e.g. _ , quantum simulations .",
    "spin - dependent transport  where the direction of transport depends on the spin state  opens especially interesting routes because it allows the creation of spin - position entangled quantum states as precursors for correlated many - particle states .",
    "a concept for such a transport with neutral atoms stored in an optical lattice was proposed by deutsch and jessen and by jaksch _ _ et  al.__@xcite and first demonstrated by mandel _ _ et  al.__@xcite with a sample of ultracold rubidium atoms in a mott insulator state , where the signature of transport was observed in momentum space .    here , we report a direct observation of spin - dependent transport in a 1d optical lattice through fluorescence imaging .",
    "in contrast to the `` top - down '' approach of ref .",
    "@xcite we use single cesium atoms prepared in low - energy thermal states in deep lattice sites@xcite .",
    "in a spin - dependent transport , the shift direction of a trapped atom along the lattice axis is determined by its internal spin ( or qubit ) state @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "such transport can be realized using two counterpropagating linearly polarized laser beams in a lin-@xmath5-lin configuration@xcite , in which the rotation angle @xmath5 of the polarization vector of one of the laser beams is continuously varied ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting light field can be decomposed into a @xmath1 and a @xmath2 circularly polarized standing wave , contributing to the trapping potential by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . here , @xmath8 is the wave vector component along the lattice axis , and @xmath9 is the depth of the potential wells . by varying the rotation angle @xmath5 , both standing waves and their contributions to the trapping potential",
    "are spatially shifted in opposite directions by a distance of @xmath10 , resulting in a relative displacement of @xmath11 and an overlapping at @xmath12 .",
    "for the outermost zeeman sublevels of the cesium hyperfine ground state manifold , a magic wavelength @xmath13 in between the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 lines can be found such that one spin state only experiences the @xmath16 component of the trapping potential while the other spin state is mainly affected by the @xmath17 component .     between the polarization vectors of an incident and a retro - reflected linearly polarized beam using an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) .",
    "both principle axes of the quarter - wave plate , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( fast and slow axes ) , and those of the eom , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are parallel and perpendicular to the polarization vector of the incident beam , respectively .",
    "a  half - wave plate in between is used to rotate the incoming polarization to @xmath22 with respect to the principal axes of the eom . ]    in our experiment , the rotation angle @xmath5 is voltage - controlled using an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the eom is driven by a high - voltage amplifier with a @xmath23 bandwidth of @xmath24 and a maximum output voltage of @xmath25 , limiting the rotation angle range to @xmath26 .",
    "for the spin ( or qubit ) states , we use @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for the optical lattice ,",
    "we choose @xmath29 and @xmath30 , resulting in spin - dependent trapping potentials @xmath31 and @xmath32 with axial and radial trapping frequencies of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . due to the residual contribution of the @xmath16 component to the @xmath35 potential , its shape changes in depth and contrast during the shift , affecting the axial and the radial trapping frequencies of atoms transported in state @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the spatial shift of @xmath35 depends nonlinearly on the rotation angle @xmath5 , see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the limited range of the rotation angle allows only two perfectly overlapping trapping potential configurations : namely , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "we , therefore , define a single transport step as a shift by a distance of @xmath39 , _",
    "i.e. _ , from one overlapping configuration to another . taking into account the periodicity of the optical lattice , it is convenient to discretize the position space along the lattice axis in units of @xmath40 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the spin - dependent shift operators then read @xmath41 and @xmath42 where we use a short - hand notation of spin - position product states @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the subscript of @xmath46 indicates the rotation direction of the polarization , _ i.e. _ , forward ( fw ) for @xmath47 and backward ( bw ) for @xmath48 , shifting the spin - dependent potentials from one overlapping configuration to another .",
    "a spin - dependent phase @xmath49 is accumulated during the shift with @xmath50 .",
    "we implement the shift operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 by feeding cosinusoidal driving ramps @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 to the amplifier s input , where @xmath55 denotes the ramp time , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the input voltages corresponding to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 configuration , respectively . for ramp times",
    "@xmath58 , these ramps almost perfectly translate to the rotation angle @xmath59 . the ramp time is chosen such that excitations between vibrational states of the atoms are negligible while still being sufficiently fast to finish the experimental sequence within the phase coherence time of @xmath60  a mandatory requirement for advanced applications of spin - dependent transport@xcite .",
    "we calculate the excitation probability by using first - order perturbation theory@xcite , where the trapping potentials are approximated as harmonic , and the axial and radial dynamics of the atoms are assumed to be decoupled . for the cosinusoidal driving ramps , we find an optimum ramp time of @xmath61 , resulting in an excitation probability of less than @xmath62 per shift .     and",
    "@xmath35 are indicated by dashed lines ; and transport of atoms by shaded bold lines . ]",
    "spin - dependent transport over distances of @xmath63 lattice sites to the left or to the right ( _ i.e. _ ,  by @xmath64 ) is realized by alternating the applications of the shift operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath0-pulses flipping the spin states between ( @xmath65 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : @xmath66 the operator @xmath67 is intentionally constructed from an even number of transport steps . by this ,",
    "the entire transport sequence always starts and ends in the @xmath36 configuration , which , due to technical issues , is the experimentally most robust configuration providing long - term stability on the time scale of seconds .",
    "such long - term stability is required for detection of the initial and the final positions of the atoms in the lattice by using fluorescence imaging@xcite with a typical exposure time of @xmath68 . otherwise , because the trap depth for atoms , except those in @xmath69 , is reduced in the non - overlapping case , atom losses would be enhanced during irradiation with the near - resonant light required for the imaging process .",
    "the @xmath0-pulses are driven by resonant rectangular microwave pulses at @xmath70 with a pulse duration of @xmath71 ( rabi frequency of @xmath72 ) .",
    "alternatively , broadband composite pulses , so called @xmath73-pulses@xcite with a duration of @xmath74 are employed to compensate for possible errors in the pulse frequency or power . to minimize frequency broadening from vectorial and tensorial contributions to the differential light shift ,",
    "microwave transitions between the internalstates of the atoms are only induced in perfectly overlapping trapping potentials .",
    "the microwave pulses are applied after each shift operation with a time delay of @xmath75 , which allows lattice polarization transients to settle .",
    "the latter are caused by the limited bandwidth of the polarization control setup and by excitation of mechanical resonances of the eom crystal .",
    "the time delay has been determined using microwave spectroscopy , utilizing the fact that spectra are significantly broadened by any displacement of the @xmath76 , @xmath77 potentials .",
    "this method ensures a maximum deviation of @xmath78 for the rotation angle in the overlap configuration , corresponding to a maximum relative displacement of the spin - dependent trapping potentials of less than @xmath79 from perfect overlap .",
    "to investigate the efficiency of our spin - dependent transport over distances of several lattice sites , we load an average of eight atoms into the optical lattice , which are randomly distributed over a region of about 150 lattice sites . we determine the initial positions of the atoms by fluorescence imaging ( exposure time of @xmath68 ) and prepare them in the spin state @xmath80 by using optical pumping .",
    "details on state - preparation and detection can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we subsequently apply the transport sequence defined by @xmath67 for @xmath81 , each composed of an even number of @xmath82 transport steps ( see eq .  ) . after transporting the atoms ,",
    "we determine their final positions by fluorescence imaging and calculate their transport distances , _",
    "i.e. _  the final positions relative to the initial ones , by considering only those atoms that are initially sufficiently far separated so that even in case of transport errors , their transport paths can not cross .     after a spin - dependent transport comprised @xmath82 transport steps for ( * a * ) @xmath83 , ( * b * ) @xmath84 , ( * c * ) @xmath85 and ( * d * ) @xmath86 .",
    "digitized histograms ( light shade ) with a bin width of @xmath87 indicate the transport distances in units of lattice sites .",

    "densely sampled histograms with a bin width of @xmath88 reveal gaussian peaks centered at integer multiples of @xmath87 .",
    "these peaks clearly reproduce the periodicity of the optical lattice verifying the position resolution achieved in our fluorescence detection and indicating that no significant drifts of the optical lattice , relative to the imaging optics occurred during the transport sequence . from the gaussian peaks",
    ", we estimate the reliability of inferring the correct transport distance @xmath92 , yielding @xmath94 .    in the ideal case ,",
    "starting from state @xmath80 and applying @xmath82 transport steps , we expect only a single histogram bar at transport distance @xmath95 with probability @xmath96 .",
    "we , indeed , observe the majority of atoms at the expected transport distance , however , with a reduced probability .",
    "the transport efficiency for @xmath82 transport steps is the measured probability for an atom to arrive at the nominal transport distance .",
    "note that this definition does not contain any statement regarding the coherence properties of the transport .",
    "it solely reveals the successful displacement of atoms by @xmath97 lattice sites .    at a temperature of @xmath98 and a potential depth of @xmath99 , tunneling of atoms",
    "is extremely improbable during shifts of the spin - dependent potentials ( @xmath100 per shift , inferred from band - structure calculation ) . for our analysis , we , therefore , assume perfect shift operations @xmath51 and @xmath52 and attribute the imperfections to the preparation and the evolution of internal states of atoms",
    ".      errors in the state initialization at the beginning or scattering of photons from the light field of the optical lattice during the transport sequence may transfer the atoms into spin states outside the hilbert space of the qubit , _",
    "i.e. _ , to @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "except for @xmath103 , atoms in these states effectively still experience a spin - dependent trapping potential due to an unequal fraction of potential contributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , however , with a reduced trap depth at @xmath104 .",
    "hence , for atoms in states @xmath105 , we expect significant atom losses during the transport sequence .",
    "more importantly , once the internal states of the atoms have left the hilbert space of the qubit , their possible transition frequencies are far detuned from the preset @xmath0-pulse frequency by at least @xmath106 .",
    "these atoms are then no longer affected by the microwave pulses of the transport sequence . for an even number of transport steps ,",
    "they are henceforth transported back and forth close to the lattice site at which their internal state left the hilbert space of the qubit for the first time , staying behind the nominal transport distance and thus reducing the transport efficiency .",
    "in contrast to the scattering of photons , which can be regarded as a per - step imperfection , state initialization is a one time operation that is performed only once at the beginning of each transport sequence .",
    "the corresponding error imposes , therefore , merely an upper limit on the transport efficiency , irrespective of the number of subsequent transport steps , @xmath107 .    in our experiment , state initialization is limited by the optical pumping efficiency , yielding @xmath108 .",
    "the scattering of photons from the light field of the optical lattice with a calculated raman and rayleigh scattering rates of @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively , is negligible at the time scale of a typical transport step with a probability of the order of @xmath111 .",
    "the effect of photon scattering on the transport efficiency is , thus , neglected .",
    "typical pulse errors can be divided into static and dynamic perturbations of pulse area , frequency and phase during the pulse . in ensemble averages ,",
    "these perturbations usually contribute to inhomogeneous ( static perturbations ) or homogeneous ( dynamic perturbations ) broadenings or shifts .",
    "their effect on the transport efficiency @xmath112 can be calculated by replacing the ideal @xmath0-pulse operators @xmath113 in eq .   by their perturbed counterparts .",
    "static phase perturbations do not affect the transport efficiency , because spin states of correctly transported atoms are automatically prepared in the pure basis states @xmath80 or @xmath4 by the shift operations .",
    "the same holds for phases accumulated during the shift so that the transport efficiency is insensitive to shift - induced dephasing .",
    "static perturbations of pulse area and frequency , on the other hand , directly affect the spin - flip efficiency in each step and , thus , the transport efficiency @xmath112 as well .",
    "such perturbations , for instance , are induced by the radial oscillation of atoms in the trapping potential , which in our case may be regarded as frozen on the time scale of a single pulse@xcite .",
    "similarly , the thermal distribution over the axial vibrational states causes an inhomogeneous frequency broadening and induces a static perturbation of the rabi frequency and , thus , of the pulse area via the franck - condon factor@xcite .",
    "vibrational excitation during the shift operations may even increase these inhomogeneities .",
    "from the transport efficiency alone , however , static perturbations are not only indistinguishable from one another but also from different dynamical perturbations such as repeatable drifts or fluctuations of lattice depth and polarization or magnetic fields .",
    "we , therefore , subsume all these perturbations in an effective spin - flip efficiency @xmath114 per pulse .    assuming that @xmath114 does not significantly change over the entire transport sequence",
    ", we expect the transport efficiency to exponentially decay according to @xmath115 the alignment procedure of the experimental setup aims at identical microwave spectra for both overlapping configurations , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , including the amplitudes , positions and shapes of the resonance peaks , supporting this assumption .     as a function of the number of transport steps @xmath82 for a sequence employing rectangular @xmath118(@xmath0)-pulses ( @xmath119 ) and composite @xmath73-pulses of equal rabi frequency ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the vertical , dotted line indicates the upper transport efficiency limit imposed by the state initialization @xmath121 . the solid ( dashed ) line shows a fit of the model function of eq .   to the data obtained for @xmath118-pulses ( @xmath73-pulses ) in the transport sequence . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the measured transport efficiency as a function of the number of transport steps is shown .",
    "it fits well the exponential dependence of eq .  , yielding @xmath122 slight deviations of individual data points from the fit in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] could be partially attributed to slow drifts of lattice polarization over time .",
    "such drifts have been monitored independently by measuring the polarization state of the retro - reflected beam after passing the trapping region of the atoms .    to reduce possible effects of static frequency and pulse area perturbations on the spin - flip efficiency , including the corresponding inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms , we have replaced the regular , rectangular @xmath0-pulses by broadband composite pulses in the transport sequence , namely @xmath73-pulses .",
    "the latter are robust against static detunings within a calculated ( @xmath123-)range of @xmath124 ( compared to @xmath125 of the regular , rectangular @xmath0-pulses ) for static pulse area perturbations of up to @xmath126 .",
    "the measured transport efficiency as a function of the number of transport steps for this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( @xmath120 ) . from a fit of eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath127 which incidentally agrees with the value for the regular @xmath0-pulses ( see eq .  ) .",
    "this means that the compensation of static perturbations ( _ e.g. _ , inhomogeneities ) by the composite pulses does not improve the transport efficiency .",
    "this finding suggests that the finite transport efficiency is dominated by dynamic perturbations , such as lattice polarization drifts and fluctuations ( decoherence ) during the pulse affecting the internal state of the atom .",
    "also , we can not exclude that the improvement of the spin - flip efficiency of the composite pulse is counteracted by additional dephasing during the pulse due to its three times longer duration .",
    "decoherence is typically characterized by a longitudinal relaxation time @xmath128 and a dephasing time @xmath129 .",
    "we have measured longitudinal relaxation by preparing the atoms in state @xmath80 or @xmath4 and performing a typical transport whereby @xmath0-pulses are removed from the sequence , and thus their possible errors as well .",
    "atoms are then only transported back and forth to the initial lattice site . finally , we determine the population in state @xmath4 after different times by using state - selective push out@xcite , yielding @xmath130 , in agreement with the calculated limit imposed by the raman scattering processes in the lattice .",
    "measuring dephasing during the pulses in the transport sequence and precisely inferring the irreversible @xmath131 time , _",
    "e.g. _ , from decay of rabi oscillations , turns out to be non - trivial due to technical instability of the @xmath37 overlapping configuration on the time scale required .",
    "we , therefore , estimate this @xmath131 time by solving the ( pulse - driven ) optical bloch equations for the measured spin - flip efficiency of eqs .   and , yielding @xmath132 .",
    "the corresponding spectrum , calculated from the optical bloch equations , deviates , however , from the measured spectra in shape .",
    "these deviations may arise from repeated ( non - random ) dynamic perturbations that are not covered by the simple relaxation model in the bloch equations .",
    "consequently , these perturbations should not be interpreted as fluctuations , and the true irreversible dephasing time @xmath131 may be much longer then estimated above . in comparison , in a `` static '' lattice configuration",
    "( no transport ) , this dephasing time @xmath131 is on the order of several milliseconds , as inferred from rabi oscillations .",
    "we conclude from this fact that the spin - flip efficiency in the transport sequence is , indeed , reduced by dynamic perturbations , probably caused by drifts or oscillations of the lattice polarization , which possibly have not yet fully decayed after each shift , when the pulses are applied . on the one hand ,",
    "such dynamic perturbation directly translate into drifts and fluctuations of differential light shifts , leading to homogeneous broadening of the transition frequency and , thus , dephasing . on the other hand ,",
    "they translate into drifts and fluctuations of the rabi frequency and , thus , of the pulse area via the franck - condon factor@xcite .",
    "our interpretation is , furthermore , supported by the higher spin - flip efficiency of @xmath133 measured in a `` static '' optical lattice .",
    "employing optimum control techniques@xcite , either by microwave pulse - shaping or active polarization control , might help to counteract or compensate for dynamical drifts of our system , and , thus , improve the pulse efficiency in the future .",

    "relevant error sources are compiled in table  [ tab : infidelities ] . for our experimental parameters , tunneling of atoms is negligible during the transport , and excitations between vibrational states are minimized by numerically finding an optimum ramp time for a chosen ramp .",
