    "by definition , the pure spin current of free carriers , electrons or holes , is a spin flux without an electric current .",
    "it can be conceived as formed by opposing equivalent flows of spin - up and spin - down particles .",
    "this non - equilibrium distribution of carriers in the wave vector and spin spaces is characterized by zero charge current , because electric currents contributed by spin - up and spin - down particles cancel each other , but leads to the accumulation of opposite spins at the opposite edges of the sample . in particular , a pure spin current is produced in a direction perpendicular to an applied electric field due to spin - dependent skew or side - jump scattering of electrons by impurities or phonons . this effect known as the spin hall effect was predicted in early theoretical studies  @xcite and observed in recent years , see  @xcite .    in this study , we present the theory of pure spin currents generated under the light absorption in an unbiased semiconductor structures . in spin - dependent optical spectroscopy , the efforts were mostly directed towards ( i ) the photogeneration of nonequilibrium spin polarization of carriers , the effect known as the optical orientation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and ( ii ) the generation of spin - sensitive electric currents known as the circular photogalvanic , spin - galvanic and magneto - gyrotropic effects  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the free carriers participating in a pure spin current neither have a net spin polarization nor produce a net charge current .",
    "a spacial separation of electron spins caused by the spin photocurrent was first observed by using two - color optical coherence control techniques , due to quantum interference of one- and two - photon absorption of two orthogonally - polarized overlapping laser pulses with frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "then , bhat et al .",
    "@xcite and tarasenko and ivchenko  @xcite showed that merely one - photon absorption of linearly polarized light should produce pure spin currents in noncentrosymmetric bulk semiconductors and quantum well ( qw ) structures : in this case there is no net motion of charge but spin - up and spin - down photoelectrons travel in the opposite directions .",
    "the theoretical prediction was followed by an observation of pure spin currents induced by a single linearly polarized optical pulse in ( 110)-oriented gaas qws  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the two - color generation and control of spin currents have been extensively analyzed  @xcite . here",
    "we will consider , in order , the one - photon generation of pure spin currents in unbiased structures under interband , intersubband and intraband absorption of linearly polarized or unpolarized light and derive equations for the corresponding currents .",
    "particularly , we compare different mechanisms of pure spin currents and show difference in the behavior of their contributions as a function of the light frequency and the polarization direction with regard to the crystallographic axes .",
    "we also show that pure spin currents emerge in qw structures as soon as the electron gas is simply driven out of thermal equilibrium with the crystal lattice . finally , we will discuss a new phenomenon which can be called the pure valley - orbit current and observed in many - valley semiconductors .",
    "the role of spin - up and spin - down states in pure spin currents is replaced in the valley - orbit current by the index of the conduction - band valleys : the valleys are equally populated , there is no net charge current , but the electrons in different valleys travel in different directions .",
    "phenomenologically , the spin flux , or , in general , the flux of angular momentum , is described by a second - rank pseudotensor @xmath3 whose components @xmath4 stand for the flow in the @xmath5 direction of spins oriented along @xmath6 , with @xmath6 and @xmath5 being the cartesian coordinates .",
    "nonzero components of the photo - induced spin current @xmath3 are determined by the light polarization and the explicit form of spin - orbit interaction governed by the structure symmetry .",
    "they can be revealed from the symmetry analysis which requires no knowledge about microscopical mechanisms of the spin current generation .",
    "indeed , in the regime of linear dependence of @xmath3 on the light intensity @xmath7 , the spin - photocurrent components are phenomenologically related by @xmath8 to the light - polarization unit vector @xmath9 and the complex conjugate vector @xmath10 .",
    "equation  ( [ j_phen ] ) represents the most general form of the spin photocurrent description because the set of quadratic terms @xmath11 fully determines the light polarization state  @xcite .",

    "the pseudotensor @xmath16 describes spin photocurrents which are independent of the sign of light circular polarization for elliptically polarized light and can be conveniently measured for the linearly polarized radiation . in contrast , the tensor @xmath17 stands for helicity - sensitive spin photocurrents which reverse their polarity upon switching the sign of circular polarization .",
    "this occurs because the cross product @xmath18 $ ] is zero for linearly polarized light and proportional to the light helicity for elliptical or circular polarization .",
    "usually , the absorption of circularly polarized light results in a considerable spin polarization of photoexcited carriers  @xcite masking the observation of pure spin currents .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we focus on spin currents excited by linearly polarized light only and assume the polarization vector @xmath9 to be real .    in crystals having a zinc - blende structure and characterized by the symmetry point group @xmath19 ,",
    "the linearly polarized light can induce both diagonal @xmath20 and off - diagonal @xmath4 ( @xmath21 ) components of the spin current .",

    "equation  ( [ je1 ] ) shows that pure spin currents can be injected in qws by the elastic - scattering - assisted photoexcitation with linearly polarized light but vanish for the normally - incident unpolarized radiation , when @xmath200 , @xmath201 .",
    "the nonzero components of the spin current are determined by the explicit form of the matrix element of scattering and the light polarization plane . in qws grown on ( 110)-oriented substrates ,",

    "the pure spin current caused by the free - carrier absorption can be converted into an electric current by polarizing electron spins , e.g. , by application of an external magnetic field , as was shown by ganichev et al .",
    "@xcite , see also  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "in the case of intrasubband absorption , the fluxes of the spin - up and spin - down electrons , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , are proportional to the electron densities in the spin subbands , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively . in a spin - polarized system , where @xmath211 , the fluxes @xmath207 and @xmath208 do no longer compensate each other yielding a net electric current @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the average electron spin with @xmath214 .",
    "in addition to the free - carrier absorption , the spin - dependent asymmetry of the electron scattering by phonons gives rise to a pure spin current if the electron gas is simply driven out of thermal equilibrium with the crystal lattice  ( see refs .",
    "in such a relaxational mechanism , the spin current is generated in the process of energy relaxation of electrons no matter how the thermal equilibrium between the electron and phonon subsystems was initially disturbed .",
    "the relaxational mechanism of the spin current generation is illustrated in fig .",
    "3(b ) , where the processes of energy relaxation of hot electrons by emitting phonons are shown by dashed curves .",
    "due to the spin - dependent asymmetry of the electron - phonon interaction , electrons with the spin @xmath116 relax faster from the high - energy states with positive @xmath117 , while electrons with the spin @xmath118 predominantly vacate the high - energy states with negative @xmath117 .",
    "this leads to an asymmetrical distribution , where the spin - up carriers occupy mainly the left - hand branch of the dispersion curve ( carriers with the opposite spin orientation have gone to the subband bottom ) , while the spin - down carriers occupy mainly the right - hand branch .",
    "such a spin - dependent imbalance of electrons between positive and negative @xmath117 yields a pure spin current .",
    "we consider the energy relaxation of electrons confined in a qw by bulk acoustic phonons .",

    "we assume that both electrons and phonons obey the boltzmann statistics , but the electron temperature @xmath220 differs from the lattice temperature @xmath221 .",

    "the dominant spin - dependent contribution to the hamiltonian of electron - phonon interaction in the deformation - potential model is proportional to @xmath227 , and the corresponding hamiltonian has the form  @xcite @xmath228 here , @xmath229 and @xmath230 are the intraband and interband constants of the deformation potential , @xmath231 are the phonon - induced strain tensor components , @xmath232 $ ] , and @xmath233 is the spin - orbit splitting of the valence band .",
    "the interband constant @xmath230 originates from the lack of an inversion center in zinc - blende - type crystals and vanishes in centrosymmetric semiconductors  @xcite . assuming that electrons are confined in a rectangular quantum well of the width @xmath234",
    ", we derive for the spin current @xmath235 equation  ( [ j_heat2 ] ) shows that the spin current component @xmath124 strongly depends on the qw width .",

    ", one can consider pure orbit - valley currents , where partial electron fluxes in valleys @xmath237 are nonzero but the net electric current @xmath238 vanishes  @xcite . here ,",
    "the role of spin - up and spin - down states is replaced by the valley index : there is no net charge current , but the electrons in different valleys travel in different directions .    to elaborate the concept of pure orbit - valley currents , we consider silicon - based quantum wells grown on a ( 111)-oriented surface . in si",

    "asymmetrical ( 111)-grown qws , each valley has the @xmath48 point - group symmetry allowing for the generation of a partial in - plane flux @xmath237 at normal incident of the light .",
    "under excitation with unpolarized light , the fluxes @xmath237 are directed along the in - plane projections of the valley principle axes [ see fig .",

    "thus , such an electron distribution can be referred to as an optically injected pure valley - orbit current .",
    "= 0.95    in addition to the polarization - independent photocurrent , the excitation of a si ( 111)-grown qw with circularly polarized light at normal incidence results , in each valley , in a flux component @xmath248 which reverses its direction upon switching the light polarization from right - handed to left - handed circular polarization .",
    "such helicity - dependent components @xmath248 flow perpendicularly to the valley principle axes [ see fig .",

    "we note that the absence of a total photocurrent under illumination with unpolarized or circularly polarized light is related to the overall @xmath249 symmetry of the qws which , however , allows for a net electric current induced by linearly polarized light . in this particular case , the partial fluxes in valleys become nonequal and do not compensate each other .",
