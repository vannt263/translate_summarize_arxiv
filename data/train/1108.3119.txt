    "the liquid - amorphous transition in silicon , modeled by the stillinger - weber ( sw ) potential  @xcite , has been intensely studied  @xcite with an aim of understanding the phase behavior of real silicon . in the initial molecular dynamics ( md ) studies on sw silicon  @xcite , it was found that the high density liquid ( hdl ) phase , at a sufficiently slow cooling rate , undergoes a sudden transition to a low density amorphous phase at around 1060 k. the nature of the low density phase ( i.e. , whether it is a solid or a liquid ) below the transition temperature was however not clear . in 2003 ,",
    "sastry and angell , through precise and careful measurements of the diffusivity in md simulations , showed that a low density liquid ( ldl ) phase exists below 1060 k and hence the transition should be characterized as a liquid ",
    "liquid transition  @xcite .",
    "it was also demonstrated that in constant pressure  constant enthalpy ( nph ) md simulations starting from the hdl phase at @xmath4 k , the enthalpy shows a nonmonotonic dependence on temperature , ultimately leading to the formation of the ldl phase  @xcite .",
    "this was attributed to the release of latent heat during the phase transformation from the hdl phase to the ldl phase  @xcite .",
    "recently , studies by hujo et .",
    "@xcite and limmer and chandler  @xcite do not suggest the presence of a phase coexistence temperature between the hdl and the ldl phases at zero pressure .    in this work ,",
    "we study equilibrium hdl phases at and above 1060 k in isothermal  isobaric ( npt ) monte carlo ( mc ) simulations at zero pressure , focusing particularly on the volume ( or density ) distributions .",
    "we find that due to shallow free energy barriers , complete equilibration of the hdl phase can not be achieved in some mc trajectories , leading to non - equilibrium states at 1060 k. we have used a recently developed thermodynamic integration method  @xcite to measure precisely the excess gibbs free energy ( @xmath0 ) of the hdl phases with respect to the crystalline phases at a given temperature and pressure .",
    "these computations yield information about the entropy changes in the hdl phases as the temperature is decreased to 1060 k. our work provides further insight into the transition from the hdl phase to the low density phases near 1060 k. in what follows , we describe the details of our computational method .",
    "to compute the excess free energy ( to be described in the next section ) , it is important to correctly determine the average properties of the hdl phase in the supercooled region . to this end",
    ", we studied the properties of the supercooled hdl phase by performing isothermal - isobaric ( npt ) monte carlo ( mc ) simulations at and above @xmath3 k and zero pressure .",
    "all of our computations were performed with a system of @xmath5 particles in a cubic simulation box under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our main result is strongly dependent on the properties of the hdl phase in the temperature range of 10601070 k and hence we focus particularly on this temperature range .",
    "we find that at @xmath6 k , the simulations starting in the hdl phase undergo a transition relatively quickly to the low density phases , indicating shallow free energy barriers . by trial and error",
    ", we find the trajectory that stays in the high density region for the largest number of mc steps at 1060 , 1065 and 1070 k , by starting from different initial configurations ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : trajectory1 ] and  [ fig : trajectory2 ] ) . at 1060 k",
    ", we also found shorter trajectories ( seen in the inset of figs .",
    "[ fig : trajectory1 ] and  [ fig : trajectory2 ] ) corresponding to non - equilibrium states .",
    "the computed average densities of the hdl phases ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) at @xmath7 k agree reasonably well with those found in the md cooling experiments of beaucage and mousseau  @xcite .    to obtain the average properties of the hdl phases , we consider the entire length of the trajectory before it exhibits a systematic and continuous decrease in energy and density ( as indicated by the arrow positions in figs .",
    "[ fig : trajectory1 ] and  [ fig : trajectory2 ] ) , which signals the crossing of the free energy barrier .",
    "one noticeable feature is that these trajectories do not seem to have converged to the mean values ( at the arrow positions ) , unlike the metastable states which are normally encountered .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the probability distribution with respect to the volume and energy is broad and highly asymmetric for the hdl phases . at 1065",
    "k and 1070 k , we find that shorter trajectories ( not shown ) generated independently ( with lengths of 10.4 and 35.2 million mc steps , respectively ) acquire average energies and densities ( just before crossing the free energy barrier ) , which are nearly equal to the values reported here for the longer trajectories .",
    "for this reason , it is important to consider the entire length of the trajectories upto the arrow positions to compute the average properties .",
    "if one considers smaller portions of the trajectories , the resulting average properties will not reflect the correct sampling of the free energy surface .    at 1060 k , we find that the average properties of the shorter trajectories ( denoted as 1060-s1 and 1060-s2 ) and the longer trajectory ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) differ considerably .",
    "due to its shallowness , the free energy barrier is crossed even before the equilibration is achieved , leading to the non - equilibrated shorter trajectories . in case of the longer trajectory at 1060 k ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : trajectory1 ] and  [ fig : trajectory2 ] ) , the cumulative averages show an overall drift to lower densities and energies and therefore it may appear that the high energy ( and high density ) states become inaccessible as the trajectory progresses .",
    "however it is clear from the _ instantaneous _ block averages along the trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory3 ] , that the higher energy ( and higher density ) states remain accessible even towards the end of the hdl portion of the trajectory .",
    "the same is the case with the trajectories at 1065 and 1070 k. in a latter section , our analysis based on gibbs helmholtz equation indicates that trajectories at 1065 and 1070 k , as well as the longer trajectory at 1060 k represent equilibrium phases .",
    "next we analyze the pressure ( p)volume ( v ) curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spinodal1 ] ) and the helmholtz free energy of the hdl phases as a function of volume ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fv1065 ] ) from the data generated by the above hdl trajectories . here",
    "@xmath8 is the volume per particle ( in units of @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 is the average virial pressure ( in units of @xmath11 ) obtained from fluctuations that correspond to a bin of width @xmath12 taken at @xmath13 .",
    "( the quantities reported throughout this work are expressed in units of sw potential parameters  @xcite @xmath14 and @xmath15 , unless otherwise noted explicitly ) .",
    "we obtain the helmholtz free energy at a given v by using the fact that in isothermal ",
    "isobaric ensemble at zero pressure , the probability density of finding the system with a specific volume v is @xmath16 $ ] . hence if @xmath17 is the number of configurations generated in mc simulations with a specific volume between @xmath13 and @xmath18 , then @xmath19 \\delta v$ ] and hence @xmath20 constant .",
    "this is the quantity we have plotted verses v in fig .  [ fig : fv1065 ] and also in the subsequent figures .    at 1070 k",
    ", we observe a region with an approximately zero slope in the p - v curve as indicated by the two highlighted points along the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinodal1 ] , indicating the presence of a two - phase region . at 1060 and 1065",
    "k , we observe a region in the p - v curve with a positive slope . at 1060 k and 1065 k , we are able to construct double tangent lines corresponding to the van - der - waals ( vdw ) loops as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : double_tangent ] .",
    "the two ends of the tangent line represents two states with the same chemical potential at the same temperature and pressure and hence the relation @xmath21 is valid  @xcite , where @xmath22 represents the difference of the properties of the two states across the tangent line . in the present case ,",
    "the values of @xmath10 in the above equation are @xmath23 and @xmath24 at 1060 k ( long trajectory ) and 1065 k , respectively .",
    "both the terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 have the same sign indicating a non - zero enthalpy difference between states joined by the double - tangent lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : double_tangent ] ) .    at 1065",
    "k , we find that f - v curve is not symmetric about the maximum even for small deviations away from the maximum .",
    "instead we find that the distribution can be described fairly accurately by a taylor series expansion around the spinodal according to the following equation .",
    "@xmath27 here @xmath28 corresponds to the volume at the spinodal .",
    "the second order term is taken as zero , since by definition , the second derivative is zero at the spinodal .",
    "taking derivatives by finite difference always involves much noise and therefore it is not possible to reliably compute @xmath29 directly by numerical differentiation .",
    "we used the actual value of @xmath30 ( average virial pressure ) as measured in simulation at the spinodal density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : double_tangent ] ) , while we fitted the value of @xmath29 by trial and error so as to best fit the data .",
    "the resultant curve agrees well with the actual value of @xmath31 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp1065 ] .",
    "we considered @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the left spinodal at @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the right spinodal at @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests that the probability distribution with respect to @xmath38 , is controlled by the spinodals at the two ends of the unstable region .    also , we find that the expansion on either side of the unstable region is accurate only upto the spinodal and deviates rapidly from the actual curve on the other side of the spinodal as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sp1065 ] .",
    "this implies a discontinuity in the equation of state at the two spinodals , which is expected because the two ends of the vdw loop usually correspond to the two separate phases each having its own equation of state and that each phase extends right upto the spinodal on either side of the vdw loop .",
    "it is to be noted that the hdl phase configurations consists of atoms connected to form tetrahedra  @xcite .",
    "the different tetrahedra are connected through common atoms forming a network and the number of these tetrahedral structures can fluctuate causing overall variations in the potential energy and the density .",
    "the above taylor series expansion around the spinodals may be attributed to the network forming tendency of the liquid .",
    "this needs to be investigated further .",
    "we observe that the following fluctuation relation  @xcite is satisfied by the mc trajectories : @xmath39 when we consider @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the instantaneous pressure in the npt - mc simulations calculated from the virial relation  @xcite at the given instantaneous volume @xmath38 and @xmath1 is the externally set temperature .",
    "the symbol @xmath43 represents the average taken over the entire trajectory of the isothermal isobaric mc simulations .",
    "this fluctuation relation is derived by assuming  @xcite that the instantaneous fluctuations represents a change in state from one homogeneous phase to the other .",
    "the relation is satisfied by the entire trajectory consisting of the hdl , ldl and the defect crystal regions , as well as by the partial trajectories consisting only of the hdl phase region .",
    "this possibly indicates that transition from the hdl phase to the ldl or the d - crystal phases along the trajectory involves entirely homogeneous states .",
    "we also find that the total average virial pressure is zero at all points along the mc trajectories meaning that the system is in mechanical equilibrium throughout .",
    "we computed the excess gibbs free energy difference @xmath44 between the hdl and the crystal phases , by applying the constrained fluid @xmath45 integration method  @xcite in the isothermal  isobaric ensemble  @xcite .",
    "recently , the method was found to predict the melting point of sw silicon accurately  @xcite . this is a thermodynamic integration method in which the liquid and the crystal phase are connected directly through a 3-stage reversible path . in stage 1 of the reversible path , which starts from the liquid phase ,",
    "the strength of the interaction potential is reduced linearly so that the system approaches an ideal gas - like behavior .",
    "the expression for the potential energy in this stage is given by  @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant that determines the effective strength of the interaction potential at the end of stage 1 and @xmath48 is the original inter - particle potential ( sw potential , in the present case ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 defines the states along the path and varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "as the system becomes less attractive it tends to expand . however , to maintain the reversibility of the path in stages 2 and 3 , it is necessary to impose a maximum volume constraint  @xcite .",
    "the maximum constrained volume @xmath50 is chosen such that it is slightly larger than the average volumes of the liquid and the solid phase ( whichever is larger ) .",
    "at the same time , @xmath50 should not affect the free energies of either of these phases  @xcite .",
    "such a volume can be straightforwardly chosen based on the histogram of volume fluctuations for the two phases .",
    "as in an earlier work on sw silicon  @xcite , we chose @xmath50 to correspond to a density of @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 . at the end of stage 1 , we get a compressed gas phase due to the constraint on the maximum volume  @xcite .",
    "this process is depicted pictorially in fig .",
    "[ fig : method ] .    in stage 2",

    "the fluctuations in the hdl phases can access the low density regions to a greater degree across the vdw loop , upon lowering the temperature and consequently , the average density and average energy reduces rapidly .",
    "we were able to construct the double tangent lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sp1065 ] ) across the states forming the vdw loops at 1060 and 1065 k. this implies that the relation @xmath21 holds true between these states with @xmath10 being a negative pressure ( here both the terms @xmath25 and @xmath148 have the same sign , implying a non - zero enthalpy difference ) .",
    "we found that at 1065 k , the entire f - v curve ( fig .  [ fig : sp1065 ] ) could be described by a taylor series expansion around the spinodals [ eq .  ( [ eq : prob_density3 ] ) ] .",
    "we computed precisely the excess gibbs free energy @xmath0 of the hdl phase at different temperatures by using a recently developed thermodynamic integration method  @xcite .",
    "based on the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : new5 ] ) by our data , we found that the hdl phase trajectories correspond to the equilibrium phases , except for the shorter trajectories at 1060 k ( 1060-s1 and 1060-s2 ) .",
    "we then computed the excess entropy of the equilibrium hdl phases from the relation : @xmath149 .",
    "for the non - equilibrium hdl phases at 1060 k , we computed @xmath110 from the slope of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 [ eq .  ( [ eq : fd ] ) ] .",
    "based on these computations , we conclude that the absolute entropy of the hdl phase increases as its enthalpy changes from the equilibrium value at @xmath2 k to the value corresponding to the non - equilibrium states at @xmath3 k. our conclusion is supported qualitatively by the fact that the average energy of the hdl phase ( 1060-s1 ) at 1060 k is slightly higher as compared to that of hdl phase at 1065 k ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .    in the previous md studies  @xcite",
    "it was observed that the hdl phase , at a sufficiently slow cooling rate , transforms into a low density amorphous phase at or below @xmath3 k. ( here by amorphous phase , we do not necessarily mean the ldl phase  @xcite , but any intermediate phase between the hdl and the ldl phases ) .",
    "the trajectories we generated indicate that the free energy barrier becomes very shallow at or below @xmath3 k , and hence upon cooling from the high temperature phases ( @xmath2 k ) , it is difficult to achieve the equilibration of the hdl phases . on the other hand ,",
    "our computations indicate that the non - equilibrium hdl phases ( at @xmath150 k ) one encounters , possess a higher entropy compared to high temperature equilibrium phases . since the process of _ cooling _ at zero pressure necessarily involves reduction of the entropy , the hdl phase at @xmath2 k will not transform into a higher entropy hdl phase at @xmath150 k. these are the likely reasons which trigger the transformation of the hdl phase into low density phases near 1060 k upon cooling , as observed in npt ",
    "md simulations  @xcite .",
    "it is generally supposed that such transformations are caused due to a coexistence temperature between the hdl and the low density phases located near 1060 k at zero pressure",
    ". however , recent studies by hujo et .",
    "al .  @xcite and limmer and chandler  @xcite do not support this viewpoint .",
    "the volume distributions in the equilibrium hdl phases at 1060 k and 1065 k shows low density and high density states ( joined by double tangents in fig .  [ fig : double_tangent ] ) having the same chemical potential at a _ non - zero _ ( negative ) pressure .",
    "weather such a condition ( i.e. , equality of chemical potentials between the high density and the low density states ) is also attainable at zero pressure is an interesting question and this needs to be investigated further .    in the case of nph md simulations  @xcite ,",
    "the nonmonotonic enthalpy  temperature loop starts at a temperature just above @xmath3 k. normally , the nph simulations should trace the equilibrium ( monotonic ) enthalpy - temperature curve .",
    "however , it seems difficult to achieve equilibration of the hdl phases in nph simulations for the following reasons .",
    "we note that in a statistical mechanical treatment , the properties of a macroscopic system are not taken as strictly constant , but are allowed to fluctuate  @xcite .",
    "this is specially necessary in the case of hdl phases near 1060 k , which show broad and asymmetric volume distributions indicating the importance of fluctuations . in the nph simulations , on the other hand ,",
    "the enthalpy is strictly constant which suppresses relevant fluctuations of enthalpy .",
    "for example , the two states joined by the double tangents in fig .  [ fig : double_tangent ] have a non - zero enthalpy difference and both of which contribute significantly to the average properties .",
    "the nph simulations can not access both the states simultaneously , preventing equilibration of the hdl phases .",
    "this is the probable reason why the nph simulations could not access the monotonic enthalpy  temperature curve corresponding to the equilibrium hdl phases at or just above 1060 k  @xcite .",
    "the focus of our entire work is an extremely narrow temperature range 1060 - 1070 k , though we have also computed hdl phase properties and excess gibbs free energies at higher temperature ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "we found it difficult to obtain trajectory corresponding to an equilibrium hdl phase below 1060 k. nonetheless , our work indicates unexpected but important changes in the properties of the hdl phase that are consistent with the phase transitions observed in earlier studies at or near 1060 k. this , along with the fact that small temperature variations ( as low as 0.1 k ) are known to induce significant changes in the properties of other materials  @xcite , justifies our focus on the narrow temperature range .",
    "it is desirable to perform free energy computations for the hdl phases with different number of particles to study system size effects .",
    "however due to the large extent of computations needed to obtain @xmath0 with a sufficient precision , it is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "it may be noted that the density plots from md cooling experiment with 512  @xcite , 1000  @xcite and 4096  @xcite particles are qualitatively similar and show the phase transitions near 1060 k. recent first principles md simulations of supercooled silicon  @xcite have demonstrated the presence of the vdw loops separating the high density and low density liquids .",
