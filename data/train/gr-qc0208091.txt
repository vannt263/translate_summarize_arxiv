    "the standard big bang scenario is based on an assumption of the homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter and radiation .",
    "this assumption then leads to the robertson - walker spacetime geometry and the friedmann - lematre ( fl ) universe model through the einstein equations .",
    "this model has succeeded in explaining various important observational facts : hubble s expansion law , the content of light elements and the isotropic cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr)@xcite .",
    "the cmbr conversely gives a strong observational basis for the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy of our universe by its highly isotropic distribution together with the copernican principle ; we know that our universe was highly isotropic and homogeneous at least on the last scattering surface where cmbr comes from@xcite .",
    "hence , in the early stage of our universe , the linear perturbation analysis in the fl universe model is a powerful tool to investigate the dynamical evolution of our universe@xcite .    in order to perform the perturbation analysis",
    ", we need an appropriate background universe model , i.e. , information of the hubble parameter , the density parameter and further the equation of state of the matter , radiation and so on , in the real universe .",
    "to fix the background universe , we use the observational data in the neighborhood of our galaxy .",
    "especially the hubble parameter is determined from the data about the distance - redshift relation within @xmath0mpc except for the type ia supernova .",
    "however , the universe in a region within @xmath0mpc is highly inhomogeneous and hence there are non - trivial prescriptions to identify the present inhomogeneous universe to the homogeneous and isotropic fl universe model .",
    "if those procedure are not appropriate , we might miss finding the correct background universe .",
    "it is often stated that the spatially averaged observational data in the vicinity of our galaxy are recognized as those of the background fl universe model .",
    "the hubble parameter determined by the observed distance - redshift relation in our universe is regarded as the expansion rate of the volume of the region co - moving to matter .",
    "there are several researches for the effects of inhomogeneities on the volume expansion of the universe@xcite . especially , nambu applied the renormalization group method to the second order cosmological perturbation theory and claimed that the expansion of the dust filled universe is decelerated by the inhomogeneities@xcite .    in the real universe",
    ", this back reaction effect might be very small@xcite . however in order to get deeper insight into the dynamics of the inhomogeneous universe , we will consider the situation in which the back reaction of the inhomogeneities seems to be effective .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the swiss - cheese universe model and investigate the volume expansion in it .",
    "the original swiss - cheese universe model is constructed by choosing non - overlapping spherical regions in the background homogeneous and isotropic dust filled universe and then replacing these regions by the schwarzschild space - time whose mass parameter is identical with the `` gravitational '' mass of the dust fluid in the removed region . on the other hand , in this article , we consider a modified version ; we first remove spherical regions from the homogeneous and isotropic dust filled universe and then fill these regions with spherically symmetric but inhomogeneous dust balls .",
    "a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous dust ball is described by the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution which is an exact solution of the einstein equations , and hence by this procedure , we obtain an exact solution of einstein equations , which represents an inhomogeneous universe . using this solution",
    ", we can study non - linear effects of inhomogeneities on the volume expansion of the universe without use of perturbation analysis .",
    "in the ltb solution , shell crossing singularities are generic .",
    "since the ltb solution is no longer valid after the occurrence of the shell crossing , we need to change the treatment if it occurs . as a crude approximation to describe the dynamics after the shell crossing ,",
    "we adopt a model in which the shell crossing region is replaced by a spherical dust shell .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "sc ] , we explain how to construct modified swiss - cheese universe models which are studied in this article . we investigate the volume expansion rate in the case of small perturbations in section [ sec : perturb ] and in the highly inhomogeneous case in [ sec : non - linear ] . in section [ sec : non - linear ] , an alternative model is also constructed which describes the universe after the shell crossing and investigate the dynamics of this model .",
    "finally , section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "we use the units in which @xmath1 throughout the paper .",
    "in this section , we give a prescription to construct msc universe model .",
    "first we consider a einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe and then remove spherical regions from it ; these removed regions should not overlap with each other . next these regions filled with inhomogeneous dust balls with the same radii and the same gravitational mass as those of the removed homogeneous dust balls . in this msc universe model , each inhomogeneous region",

    "therefore the behavior of the volume expansion obtained ( fig .",
