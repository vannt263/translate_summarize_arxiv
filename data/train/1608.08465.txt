    "and frequency regulation of microgrid are essential in both grid connected and islanded modes @xcite . in grid",
    "connected mode , frequency is dictated by the main grid while the voltage within the microgrid can be regulated based on its reactive power generation and consumption . when the microgrid disconnects from the main grid in response to , say , upstream disturbance or voltage fluctuation and goes to islanding mode , both voltage and frequency at all locations in the microgrid have to be regulated to nominal values .",
    "typical microgrid control hierarchy includes ( 1 ) primary control for real and reactive power sharing between distributed generators ( dgs ) @xcite ; and ( 2 ) secondary control to maintain load voltage and frequency close to nominal values via respective references communicated to each dg davoudi@xcite from a controller .",
    "using centralized control requires complex and expensive communication infrastructure and is subject to failure in the central controller and communication links . to overcome these limitations , distributed cooperative control @xcite can be utilized which employs a sparse network .",
    "the application of cooperative control for dg operation in power systems in grid connected mode has been studied in @xcite among others .",
    "the technique of providing the reference values to only a fraction of the dgs in the network , known as _ pinning _ , has been studied in @xcite@xcite . in @xcite , _ pinning control _ in microgrid islanding mode using energy storage system as master unit was recently studied . in @xcite ,",
    "bidram _ et al .",
    "_ employed multi - agent distributed cooperative secondary voltage control of the microgrid .    in the aforementioned studies ,",
    "the selection of the pinned ( or leader ) dg(s ) has been assumed to be arbitrary .",
    "however , as has been shown in manaffam13a , delellis13,chen07 , the performance and robustness of the network is directly related to the choice of the _ pinning set , _ _",
    "i.e. , _ the set of pinned or leader dg(s ) .",
    "recent results obtained by the authors in @xcite obtain tight upper and lower bounds on the algebraic connectivity of the network to the reference signal . by taking advantage of these novel results , the work in this paper proffers multiple novel contributions .",
    "we first formulate the problem of single and multiple pinning of multi - agent distributed cooperative control in microgrids .",
    "next , the effect of proper selection of pinning dgs is discussed .",
    "then , we propose two implementable pinning node(s ) selection algorithms based on degree and distance of the candidate leader(s ) from the rest of the microgrid .",
    "several cases of power system topologies and communication networks as well as different scenarios are numerically simulated to show that intelligent selection of the pinning node(s ) results in better transient performance of the dgs terminal profiles .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the microgrid primary and secondary control schemes for regulating voltage and frequency .",
    "the intelligent single and multiple pinning problems are formulated in section iii followed in section iv by a presentation of the algorithms for solving these problems .",
    "section v illustrates the performance of the proposed algorithms via extensive numerical simulation studies while section vi concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the basic system model consisting of the inverter based dg , the primary controller for the dg , and the distributed cooperative secondary controller . for more details ,",
    "the reader is referred to the development in @xcite@xcite and the references therein .",
    "the inverter based dg model consists of a three legged inverter bridge connected to a dc voltage source .",
    "the dc bus dynamics and switching process of the inverter can be neglected due to the assumptions of an ideal dc source and realization of high switching frequency of the bridge , respectively . the output frequency and voltage magnitude of each dg",
    "are set in accordance with the droop controllers @xcite . the output voltage magnitude and frequency control of the inverter itself",
    "is typically implemented with internal current controllers in the standard @xmath0 rotating reference frame with the d - axis aligned to the output voltage vector , _ e.g. , _ see @xcite . from the droop control point of view",
    ", the inverter can be assumed to be ideal in the sense that its output voltage magnitude and frequency are regulated to the desired values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , within the time frame of interest .",
    "thus , @xmath3where @xmath2 and @xmath1 are the desired angular frequency and voltage amplitude of the @xmath4 dg , respectively ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the active and reactive power outputs of the @xmath4 dg ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are reference angular frequency and voltage set points determined by the secondary control , respectively ; and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are droop coefficients for real and reactive power . here ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are generated by passing the instantaneous real and reactive power outputs of the inverter through first order low pass filter with corner frequency @xmath11 to eliminate undesired harmonics@xmath12        the goal in secondary voltage control is to determine the primary control reference voltage @xmath8 inside each dg so as to minimize the deviation of the concerned dg s output voltage @xmath13 from the constant nominal reference voltage @xmath14 .",
    "mathematically , this is accomplished by the following set of equations@xmath15where @xmath16 is an auxiliary control input given by @xmath17where @xmath18 is the voltage regulation error for @xmath4 dg , @xmath19 is a control gain , while @xmath20 denote the total number of dgs in the network . here ,",
    "@xmath21 $ ] is the adjacency matrix of the communication network , @xmath22 indicates a connection from @xmath23 dg to @xmath4 dg and otherwise @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the pinning gain of the @xmath4 dg and @xmath26 indicates which nodes are pinned to the reference value .    for the secondary frequency control ,",
    "the twin objectives are to ensure that the frequency of each dg  reaches the reference frequency @xmath27 while at the same time ensuring that active power is shared in proportion to the rating of the individual dgs .",
    "in other words , leader - following consensus and leaderless consensus problems are solved as follows @xmath28where @xmath29 is the first of two auxiliary control inputs given by@xmath30where @xmath31 is the control gain and @xmath32 is the frequency regulation error of the @xmath4 dg with respect to the reference signal .",
    "the second auxiliary control term @xmath33 ( added to ensure that generators share active power in accordance with their ratings as captured in the droop curve coefficients @xmath9 ) is generated as follows @xmath34where @xmath35 is a control gain . a block schematic of the microgrid with voltage source inverter ( vsi ) based dgs alongside the primary and secondary controllers is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib - coop - sec - ctrl ] .          after substituting ( [ eq : v_input ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : f_input ] ) into the time dynamics of ( [ ndg ] ) , we have @xmath36where @xmath37^{t}$ ] and @xmath38^{t}$ ] denote the output voltage and frequency regulation errors of the network , @xmath39)$ ] is the network s pinning gain matrix , @xmath40)$ ] is the pinning matrix , and @xmath41 $ ] is the laplacian of the adjacency matrix defined as @xmath42from ( [ eq : v_error ] ) and ( [ eq : f_error ] ) , it is clear that pinning choices @xmath25 and @xmath43 are critical to the performance of the secondary controller .",
    "as is well known from linear time - invariant system theory , the performance and robustness of the systems in ( [ eq : v_error ] ) and ( [ eq : f_error ] ) are directly dependent on the eigenvalues of @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , choosing which dg(s ) to provide the reference values to , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath45 , has an enormous impact on the performance of the microgrid .",
    "the first problem ( pinning problem 1 ) that is addressed in this paper is that of choosing the location of the nodes to be pinned under the specification of a given size of the pinning set . in other words ,",
    "given a desired number of desired pinning nodes @xmath46 , one needs to determine the @xmath45 that maximizes the minimum eigenvalue of the closed - loop system . the second problem ( pinning problem 2 ) addressed in this paper is to find the minimum number of pinning nodes ( and their locations ) while guaranteeing a certain specified convergence rate @xmath47 .",
    "it is well known that the optimal solutions for the aforementioned problems have exponential complexity @xcite .",
    "thus , finding the optimal solution is not practical in microgrids with large number of dgs which renders suboptimal solutions with polynomial time complexity to be of immense interest @xcite . to develop any effective algorithm for either of the pinning problems stated above , we need to understand how the structural properties ( such as distance , number of connections , _ etc . _ ) of the pinning set in the network affects the algebraic connectivity , @xmath48 , of the network with respect to the reference .",
    "one possible way to understand these effects is by utilizing lower and upper bounds on @xmath49 .",
    "a set of tight upper and lower bounds on the algebraic connectivity of the network with respect to the reference have recently been developed in @xcite and are provided in appendix app : bounds for the case of @xmath46 pinned nodes with @xmath50 . in what follows",
    ", we discuss the implications of these bounds .    for illustration ,",
    "consider first the single pinning case where the reference value is only available in one dg ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath51 ) . based on the bounds in appendix [ app : bounds ] ,",
    "it is clear that the upper bound on @xmath49 is a strictly increasing function of the degree of the pinning node and its pinning gain @xmath52 .",
    "additionally , if the pinning gain , @xmath52 , is considered to be very large , the upper bound on algebraic connectivity of the network with respect to the reference can be shown to be bounded as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the out degree of the pinning node . since @xmath55 ,",
    "the algebraic connectivity of the network with respect to the reference can not exceed @xmath56 for the single pinning case .",
    "thus , it is clear to see that the convergence rate of the errors in ( [ eq : v_error ] ) and ( [ eq : f_error ] ) can not exceed @xmath57 and @xmath58 for voltage and frequency , respectively .",
    "since we established that the algebraic connectivity of the network with respect to the reference is upper bounded by @xmath55 , it can be conjectured that pinning a dg with higher out - degree is more effective than pinning a dg with lower out - degree . furthermore , from the given lower bound on @xmath49 in appendix [ app : bounds ] , it can be concluded that another topological characteristic to choose the pinning dg is its _ centrality _ value which is a measure of its distance from the farthest dg in the network .",
    "this means that the candidate dg for pinning should have a low distance from the rest of the network .",
    "the general case of multiple pinning ( _ i.e. , _ @xmath59 ) can be understood by considering the set of pinned dgs as a supernode in the network and by calculating all the topological properties according to this modified definition .    before we proceed to state the algorithms arising from these bounds ,",
    "let us state the following nomenclature    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the set of all dgs , @xmath62 denotes the pinning set , @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes minus operation for sets , while d@xmath65 is the number of links directed from the pinning dgs to the rest of the network .",
    "this algorithm will choose @xmath46 pinning dgs to maximize the minimum eigenvalue of the closed - loop system .",
    "since the upper bound on the minimum eigenvalue of the pinned network is an increasing function of the degree of the pinning dg , the dgs are sorted by decreasing degree ; furthermore , from ( [ eq : lower_multiple ] ) , we know that the minimum path length between the pinning set and the rest of the network should be minimized . hence , the added pinning dg to the pinning set should maximize the combined measure , which is the minimum path length between the candidate pinning dg and the rest of the network subtracted from the out - degree of pinning .",
    "this procedure should continue until there @xmath46 dgs in the pinning set .",

    "consequently , the smallest number of pinning dgs , @xmath46 , to achieve the desired convergence rate should be chosen such that summation of the @xmath46 highest degree dgs should exceed @xmath75 .",
    "algorithm 1 is started with this @xmath46 and arrives at a pinning set @xmath62 .",
    "if the condition @xmath76 is satisfied , the algorithm stops , otherwise , one more pinning dg is added using algorithm 1 until the desired convergence rate is achieved .",
