    "it is broadly established that quantum mechanics has attributes not present in classical physics .",
    "these unusual features - like entanglement - can be used as a resource to construct technologies not historically understood to be possible .",
    "quantum sensors , quantum computers , and quantum cryptography all have specific enhancements over their classical counterparts .",
    "the construction of these new quantum - enabled technologies , however , remains extremely challenging .",
    "out of the efforts to build quantum technologies has emerged the understanding that various quantum components will be essential , or very beneficial . in the realm of photonics - based quantum technologies",
    "key quantum components include : quantum memories , photon sources , frequency converters , quantum random number generators , and single - photon detectors .",
    "the focus of this review is the quantum memory , a device that can store a single photon and recreate the quantum state after a delay , preserving its relevant quantum characteristics .",
    "quantum memories are under development by many groups around the world .",
    "approaches to quantum memory encompass the full gamut of our understanding of electromagnetic interactions , and as such these research programmes represent the most advanced techniques for the quantum control of optical signals .",
    "for example resonant ( first order ) and raman ( second order ) interactions in warm , cold , trapped , or bose - condensed atoms , in amorphous and crystalline solids , molecular gases , structured media and metamaterials are actively pursued , with engineered couplings to electronic , magnetic , vibrational and hybrid degrees of freedom .",
    "photonics is a unique platform for quantum technologies because it can support broadband signals over long distances in ambient conditions , enabling , for example , the first commercial quantum cryptographic devices .",
    "however , to extend the range of quantum cryptography systems , quantum memories are needed for repeaters . more generally for quantum technologies , mechanisms are needed to generate and guide photons , to mediate non - linearities , and to detect photons .",
    "quantum memories would enable the development of large photonic quantum processing systems , by providing the capability to coherently manipulate , buffer , and re - time photonic signals .",
    "while the primary focus of quantum memory research has been the synchronization of entanglement swapping in quantum repeater protocols for long - distance quantum communication  @xcite , the ability to interconvert material and optical quanta , to prepare non - classical states and read them out optically , and to generate and distribute long - lived entanglement , has led to a range of other applications  @xcite , so that _ quantum memories _ is now a catch - all term for a broad class of research , linked by the common theme of coherent interfacing between light and matter .",
    "as the field has developed , there have been outstanding review articles on quantum memories  @xcite .",
    "we will endeavour to be complementary to these reviews .",
    "we will report on the most recent advances of the quantum memory community , and in particular we will discuss how the incorporation of spectral / temporal signal processing techniques from classical opto - electronics is leading to the development of new applications - beyond quantum cryptographic repeaters - for quantum technologies based on quantum memory interactions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : implementations ] , we discuss quantum memory protocols by summarizing existing schemes into approaches based on optical control of the light - matter interaction or engineered absorption .",
    "we then outline experimental developments based on several solid - state and atomic physical systems . as experimental efforts are moving past proof - of - principle demonstrations , it is crucial to underline challenges towards practical demonstrations of photonic quantum memories .",
    "we dedicated a subsection to discuss some of these implementation challenges  [ sec : implementation_challenges ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] , we deliberate about emerging applications of quantum memories that are complementary to those discussed in ref .",
    "this includes applications of quantum memories in optical signal processing  [ sec : processing ] , optical quantum computation  [ sec : computing ] and non - linear interactions  [ sec : nonlinear ] .",
    "in the most general terms , the quantum memory process is the controlled absorption , and re - emission , of a photonic qubit ; however , this generic definition hides a surfeit of experimental complexity .",
    "the practical implementation of a quantum memory requires the selection of a suitable medium in which to store the photon , and a protocol by which the user can manipulate the absorption and re - emission characteristics of the medium .",
    "several protocols have been developed ; each is briefly introduced in sub - section  [ sec : protocols ] .",
    "quantum memory has been achieved in a range of physical systems which can be grouped into the following five platforms : rare - earth - ion doped solids , diamond color centers , crystalline solids , alkali metal vapors , and molecules . in sub - section",
    "[ sec : physical_systems ] , we discuss all of these physical systems and describe recent advances using each platform .    when summarizing the various platforms and protocols , it is interesting to note that most protocols have been implemented on at least two different platforms , and most platforms can support multiple protocols .",
    "despite this flexibility , no combination of protocol and physical system has yet provided all the desirable properties in a single package .",
    "hence , the choice of system and protocol for a quantum memory will depend strongly on the application .",
    "for example , for long - distance communication , the memory storage time is of paramount importance , whereas for local quantum processing applications , other properties such as the time - bandwidth product , or the multi - mode capacity may be of more interest . in sub - sections  [ sec : protocols ] and [ sec : physical_systems ] we aim to highlight the potential advantages of each system , and to highlight potential applications .    in sub - section  [ sec : implementation_challenges ] we conclude the overview of the state - of - the - art in quantum memory research by identifying three of the outstanding challenges in quantum memory research , and identify the on - going work toward solving these issues .",
    "historically , quantum memories developed along two distinct paths : optically - controlled memories , and engineered absorption . in an optically - controlled memory , intense _ control _ pulses are used to mediate absorption and retrieval .",
    "memories based on engineered absorption rely upon a large inhomogeneous broadening of an optical absorption line ; this absorption can be structured , either statically or dynamically , to produce the desired absorption and re - emission characteristics .",
    "more recently , hybrid quantum memory schemes have been developed which combine engineered absorption and optical control to extract the beneficial features of both approaches .",
    "below we summarize the various quantum memory protocols used in the literature :    _ optically - controlled memories  _ these memories are based upon a @xmath0-level system with a ground state @xmath1 , an excited state @xmath2 and a metastable _ storage _ state @xmath3 ( _ e.g. _ see fig .",
    "[ fig : noise]b ) .",
    "dipole transitions are allowed from @xmath1 and @xmath3 to @xmath2 but typically the transition from @xmath1 to @xmath3 is forbidden leading to a long radiative lifetime of the storage state .",
    "absorption , and retrieval , of the weak _ signal _ pulse are each mediated by a strong control pulse .",
    "the signal and control pulses are in two - photon resonance with the storage state but each field can be detuned by an amount @xmath4 from @xmath2 . in the regime where @xmath4 is small compared to the linewidth @xmath5 of @xmath2 , the application of the control field results in a sharp dip in the absorption profile for the signal field , known as electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) .",
    "eit can be used to slow the group velocity of light  @xcite , and ultimately to store the light in the medium by dynamic adjustment of the control pulse intensity  @xcite . when @xmath6 , despite the large detuning from optical resonance , absorption and retrieval can be achieved via off - resonant raman scattering  @xcite .",
    "a unified theoretical discussion of these techniques can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the re - emission from an optically - controlled memory only occurs when a control pulse is applied to the memory ; thus the photon can be retrieved at any time , up to the coherence time of the memory . in this sense ,",
    "an optically - controlled memory is truly _ on - demand _ which is a significant advantage , and sometimes a necessity , for many applications .",
    "the primary disadvantage of optically - controlled memories is that the intense control fields can introduce spurious noise photons which degrade the fidelity of the output .",
    "in addition , the control field used can restrict the storage of the signal field to a single optical mode such that multi - mode inputs can only be stored by spatial multiplexing  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that , in some situations , this single mode selectivity may be advantageous , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : computing ] .    _ engineered absorption  _ motivated by the available inhomogeneous broadening in rare - earth ion doped crystals  @xcite , several protocols have been designed based on controlling , or engineering , inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "this resulted in two of the most promising quantum memory protocols . in gradient echo memory ( gem )",
    "@xcite , an inhomogeneous absorption line is prepared , and then broadened by applying an electric or magnetic field gradient along the propagation direction .",
    "this is also known as longitudinal controlled - reversible - inhomogeneous - broadening ( crib )  @xcite . after absorbing a signal photon in such a broadened ensemble , reversing the external field",
    "allows the ensemble to rephase at a certain point in time that determines the recall time .",
    "the atomic frequency comb ( afc ) quantum memory protocol  @xcite relies on preparation of a periodic absorption feature , or comb , with equal peak spacing by optical pumping in an inhomogeneously - broadened ensemble .",
    "after absorption of the signal pulse , which spans multiple comb spacings , the inverse of this peak spacing pre - determines the rephasing time , and thus re - emission from the memory .",
    "this limitation of a fixed storage time can be eliminated by transferring the stored excitation temporarily to an additional level .",
    "because these memories do not require a control field , they do not suffer from the same noise problems that afflict optically - controlled memories .",
    "furthermore , because of the broadened absorption profile , they are intrinsically multi - mode , and can be used to store multiple temporal  @xcite and spectral  @xcite modes .",
    "however , these memories can not be considered truly on - demand : in crib , one must wait for the atomic polarization to rephase after the broadening has been reversed and , in afc , the storage time is pre - determined by the comb spacing .",
    "_ hybrid schemes ",
    "_ motivated by the need for on - demand readout in engineered absorption quantum memories , research efforts have focused on the use of a ` shelving state ' . in these schemes ,",
    "the signal pulse is absorbed in the structured , or broadened , medium as normal , an optical @xmath7-pulse then maps the excited state population into a meta - stable shelving state effectively pausing the procession of the atomic spins .",
    "after a controllable delay , a second @xmath7-pulse is applied and the population returns to the excited state , whereby the spin procession will continue as before , leading to re - emission of the light ( see subsection [ spin_storage ] ) .",
    "optical @xmath7-pulses can be applied to an unstructured inhomogeneously broadened ensemble to rephase the collective atomic coherence generated by an absorbed single photon pulse . to avoid noise due to the inversed atomic population , the first echo can be silenced ( suppressed ) by spatial phase mismatch generated by the first optical @xmath7-pulse .",
    "a second @xmath7-pulse can bring the population back to the ground state and allow the ensemble to reach a second rephasing time with a proper phase matching to revive the silenced echo  @xcite .",
    "a combination of engineered inhomogeneous broadening and optical control has been used in @xcite to achieve storage in spin states of rare - earth - ion - doped enesembles . in this scheme , the authors used an optically - prepared spectral hole in an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble to reduce the group velocity of an optical pulse , such that the pulse is spatially - compressed into their crystal .",
    "then a short raman pulse is used on transfer this optical excitation to a spin state for storage .",
    "_ recent protocols  _ over the past few years several theoretical schemes have been proposed that led to a better understanding of inherent similarities between different quantum memory protocols , and minimal requirements for a storage and retrieval process .",
    "here we summarize some of these protocols and their connection to already existing schemes .",
    "control over the transition dipole moment in a two - level system has been shown to allow storage and retrieval of photons equivalent to an off - resonant raman quantum memory  @xcite .",
    "this was inspired by the possibility of modulating the transition dipole moment in tm : yag by applying an external magnetic field . in another scenario ,",
    "sweeping the transition frequency of a two - level system enabled storage and retrieval of photons , such that it resembles some of the characteristics of eit and gem  @xcite .",
    "another approach in an ensemble of two - level systems involving two species with a controlled homogeneous splitting led to similarities to eit  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a space - dependent frequency shift of a propagating signal , as can be induced by a time - dependent refractive index , has also been shown to be equivalent to the gradient echo memory  @xcite .",
    "several schemes have been proposed to use different degrees of freedom of light to induce longitudinal crib . for example , phase - matching control  @xcite or spatial chirp of a control field  @xcite have been shown to reproduce the results of the gradient echo memory that was originally associated to controlled inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "these are in contrast to the temporal control induced by the shape of the control field in off - resonant raman and eit storage schemes .",
    "rare - earth - ion doped solids are appealing candidates for implementing elements for optical quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "they possess narrow homogeneous linewidths , provide optical access to electronic and nuclear spin states , and demonstrate significant optical inhomogeneous broadening that can be tailored by optical pumping techniques .",
    "in addition , these systems allow integrable @xcite and micron / nano scale @xcite implementations .",
    "rare - earth ion doped crystals have primarily been used for storage of time - bin qubits using the afc protocol  @xcite .",
    "given that the dipole moments are aligned along a specific direction in the solid , two quantum memories can be used for polarization qubit storage .",

    "this feature has been used in  @xcite to store heralded single - photon pulses at 720  nm and shift the wavelength of the recalled pulse by approximately @xmath169 nm ( 18  nm range ) .",
    "the authors also demonstrate bandwidth manipulation via pulse stretching and compression over a 3.75thz range while preserving non - classical correlations .    despite recent progress in building quantum memories that operate at telecommunication wavelengths  @xcite",
    ", the mismatch between the wavelengths for most light - matter interfaces and the most efficient wavelengths for transmission in fiber optical links provides a strong motivation for the development of mode conversion techniques that are able to function over a much broader wavelength . in particular",
    ", an efficient coherent quantum wavelength interconversion between 600 - 800  nm and 1530 - 1565  nm ( the telecommunication band ) will be an important element for future quantum networks .",
    "the phase - matching condition imposes a fundamental limit on the applicability of the engineered raman coupling control field approach employed in  @xcite . in @xcite , a specific level configuration in @xmath25rb",
    "was used to store a signal photon at 795  nm and convert it to 1367  nm ( 1530  nm ) with a conversion efficiency of up to 0.55 ( 0.3 ) .",
    "several different physical implementations for quantum information processing are under active research . of these",
    ", quantum memories have a critical role to play in the context of optical quantum information processing , which focuses on manipulating quantum information encoded in degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic field .",
    "in particular , many approaches to optical quantum information processing focus on the manipulation of single - photon - encoded qubits  @xcite .",
    "the central challenge of these schemes is that two - qubit gates require the ability to induce a strong non - linearity between optical modes containing only a few photons , which is experimentally challenging  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , knill , laflamme and milburn showed that it was , in principle , possible to carry out quantum information processing using only linear optical elements ( beam splitters and phase shifters ) , single photon sources and photo - detectors  @xcite . in this case , two - qubit gates are induced probabilistically by employing the effective non - linearity induced by single photon sensitive detectors .",
    "this shifts the experimental burden from the implementation of strong optical non - linearities to the generation of a large number of ancillary resources , necessary to overcome the probabilisitic nature of the two - qubit gates  @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "as is the case for other optical schemes , the initial generation of single photon states typically also relies on probabilisitic processes .",
    "these drawbacks mean that scaleable implementations of loqc beyond a few qubits have proven challenging .",
    "there are two aspects in which quantum memories can have a significant impact on the prospects for implementing scalable loqc .",
    "first , quantum memories allow for the synchronisation of multiple independent non - deterministic operations .",
    "in essence , this is achieved by allowing each operation to be repeated until it is successful , and then storing the outputs of the operation in quantum memories until they are needed .",
    "this synchronisation is vital for the implementation of more complex sequences of quantum gates @xcite .",
    "in addition , as shown in @xcite , by applying this technique to single - photon sources , quantum memories can significantly enhance the rate of generation of synchronized single photons from arrays of heralded probabilistic single - photon sources  @xcite .",
    "second , as has been discussed in the previous section , quantum memories are able to selectively interface with specific time - frequency modes of the electromagnetic field . moving beyond their use in simply synchronising optical modes , this unique ability allows them to be employed as versatile quantum information processing elements .",
    "this utility becomes clear when considering time - encoded optical quantum information processing .",
    "historically , linear optical quantum computing schemes have primarily been described in terms of spatial or polarisation encodings , in which two spatial or polarisation modes are required for each qubit . in @xcite , the authors instead considered using a string of time - bin encoded qubits within a single spatial mode and a set of time - dependent linear optical operations to implement loqc by reordering and coupling time - bins ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timebinconcept]a&b ) .",
    "such time - frequency encodings are advantageous due to the large space of available modes within even a single spatial mode , which may enable information processing protocols to be simplified and made more compact .",
    "the number of individual operations in the proposed scheme can be significantly reduced if a processing element can allow for the arbitrary re - ordering of several time - bins .",
    "this can be performed by using an optical pulse sequencer , which has been demonstrated for classical pulses in a warm - vapor gradient echo memory @xcite and in a multi - mode quantum memory based on a rare - earth - ion doped crystal @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timebinconcept]c ) .    an additional degree of freedom unique to some quantum memories is their frequency selectivity .",
    "this allows for interactions with optical modes in which both the temporal profile and the central frequency of the coupled mode can be dynamically controlled @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors exploit this frequency selectivity to propose a method to use quantum memories for implementing configurable unitary transformations and linear logic gates on frequency - encoded quantum information .",
    "this is achieved using a set of off - resonant raman - coupled quantum memories ; by changing the frequency of the strong control field , the coupled optical mode can be accordingly altered .",
    "the authors demonstrate how their scheme could be employed to to implement a conditional controlled - z gate .",
    "they further show that the scaling of the number of quantum memories is favorable , where for an arbitrary @xmath60-mode unitary operation , @xmath60 quantum memories are sufficient . the ability of quantum memories to act as versatile elements for the manipulation of time - frequency modes may also find an application in demonstrations of boson sampling .",
    "this restricted form of quantum information processing utilises only single photons and linear optical manipulations , and yet , surprisingly , is able to carry out a sampling problem that is strongly believed to be exponentially hard for classical computers  @xcite .",
    "several recent papers have considered using time- and frequency - selective elements for boson sampling  @xcite .",
    "these protocols could be more compactly implemented using quantum memories based on the techniques highlighted in this section .",
    "measurement - based ( one - way ) quantum computing ( mbqc ) is an efficient form of loqc that relies on a pre - prepared many - body entangled resource state , a _ cluster state _  @xcite .",
    "once this resource state has been prepared , single - qubit measurements are sufficient to perform quantum computing tasks @xcite .",
    "optical implementations of mbqc therefore require the scalable preparation of photonic cluster states . in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced a set of linear optical operations for the probabilistic preparation of such states .",
    "experimental preparation of photonic cluster states and demonstrations of one - way quantum computing have been achieved for a limited number of qubits @xcite .",
    "as is the case with other linear optical quantum information protocols , scalable photonic implementations of mbqc would also benefit from using quantum memories to enhance the success probability of the cluster state generation @xcite .",
    "thus far , we have focused on single - photon - encoded quantum information . as an alternative",
    ", information can be encoded in the quadrature amplitudes of an optical mode  @xcite . unlike the finite - dimensional information that can be encoded in the modal occupation of single photons , the quadratures present a continuum of eigenstates in which information can be encoded .",
    "this allows for a different model of information processing , termed continuous variable ( cv ) quantum information processing @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors generalize the notion of discrete - variable one - way quantum computation to continuous - variable cluster states .",
    "they propose an optical implementation using squeezed - light sources , linear optics , homodyne detection and single - mode non - gaussian measurement ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further progress has been made with preliminary experimental demonstrations @xcite and more advanced theoretical proposals @xcite , which led to ultra - large - scale generation of time - multiplexed continuous - variable cluster states @xcite .    in an attempt to improve the scalability of optical cv quantum computing , the authors in @xcite propose the use of quantum memories for quantum computing in optical time - frequency multiplexed cv cluster states . in this scheme ,",
    "the previously separately discussed time- and frequency - selectivity of raman quantum memories are combined in order to address states within a two - dimensional space of time - frequency modes ( fig  [ fig : lambdasystem ] ) .",
    "the proposal further takes advantage of two types of operations that are available through raman interactions in order to generate and manipulate time - frequency cluster states .",
    "the first operation is a beam splitter interaction between an optical mode and the memory mode ( figure  [ fig : lambdasystem]a ) , where the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath61 .",
    "this is the standard hamiltonian that underlies raman quantum memories .",
    "the second less commonly employed operation is a two - mode squeezing interaction ( figure  [ fig : lambdasystem]b ) , which can be described by @xmath62 .",
    "this interaction allows entanglement to be generated between the memory mode and an optical mode . using a combination of these two interactions , cluster states encoded in @xmath63 frequency modes and an arbitrary number of time - bin modes",
    "can be generated using only @xmath64 quantum memories ( figure  [ fig : lambdasystem]c&d ) .",
    "creating non - linear interactions at the single photon level has been a great challenge in quantum optics that requires unprecedented tailoring of light - matter interfaces , where quantum storage techniques may become useful for mediating photon - photon interaction .",
    "successful implementations of optical non - linearity enable photonic two - qubit gates @xcite and non - destructive bell - state detection @xcite , and photon switching @xcite .",
    "in the seminal work of schmidt and imamuglu @xcite , cross - phase modulation based on the ac stark effect and phase sensitivity of eit have been employed to create large kerr non - linearity . in several experiments",
    "this scheme and its variations have been used to impose non - linear interactions between weak electromagnetic fields @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors employed a quantum memory to enhance cross - phase modulation between signal and probe fields . in their proposal both fields are simultaneously stored using a raman - coupled gradient echo memory @xcite in a @xmath0 system , where the ac stark shift due to the signal results in cross - phase modulation on the probe field . in a proof of principle experiment with a freely propagating signal and a stored probe , they demonstrated a cross - phase modulation of about @xmath65 rad per signal photon @xcite .    achieving single photon sensitivity",
    "requires strong lateral confinement .",
    "this can be pursued via light - matter interfaces based on waveguides in solids @xcite , and gas - filled hollow - core photonic crystal fibers @xcite . in a recent experiment ,",
    "sinclair _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated cross - phase modulation on a probe stored in a thulium - doped lithium niobate waveguide , using the atomic frequency comb technique  @xcite . in their scheme , a spectral pit ( transparency window )",
    "is prepared for the signal to propagate through the medium and have off - resonant interaction with the stored probe .",
    "storage of the probe allowed the authors to demonstrate cross - phase shifts that are insensitive to arrival time of the signal field , and therefore is a step towards quantum non - demolition detection of photonic time - bin qubits .",
    "reiserer _ et al .",
    "_ achieved single - photon non - linearity using a different scheme that does not rely on off - resonant interaction and is thus immune to absorption loss as opposed to cross - phase modulation based on the ac stark effect  @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated non - destructive detection of single photons using single atoms trapped in a cavity .",
    "the same system was later used to apply a quantum gate between a flying optical photon and a single trapped atom  @xcite .",
    "this implementation , comprising a single atom trapped in a cavity , was successfully used to demonstrate quantum storage of optical photons  @xcite and heralded storage of photonics qubits  @xcite . despite the exceptional properties of atom - cavity light - matter interfaces , for practical reasons , it is advantageous to pursue other quantum memory implementations for mediating or implementing optical non - linearity .    another promising avenue for creating optical non - linearity is based on strong dipole - dipole interactions between high - lying rydberg states of alkali atoms  @xcite .",
    "this led to a great deal of experimental and theoretical research , to use a rydberg blockade or rydberg - induced phase shift for applications in photonic quantum information processing .",
    "recent proposals  @xcite use storage based on eit to decouple light propagation and rydberg interaction for practical implementations of rydberg - based photon - photon gates .    in @xcite ,",
    "an alternative physical process has been considered to mediate photon - photon interaction that relies on atomic collisions in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) to realize a controlled - phase gate between two stored photons . despite the fact that the collisional interactions are very weak , these approaches take advantage of long storage time of about 1 second in becs  @xcite . such a kerr non - linearity has also been used to study realization of macroscopic coherent spin states , where stored coherent states evolve into so - called cat states due to atomic collisions in bec  @xcite .",
    "photonic quantum memory research has seen a wealth of progress on multiple fronts in recent years , as the considerable citation list will attest .",
    "memories can be conceived as controllable light - matter interfaces for building elements in optical quantum information processing .",
    "their applications now extend  @xcite far beyond their initial role in long - distance quantum communication based on linear optics  @xcite . in this review , we focused on recent experimental and theoretical developments in implementing photonic quantum memories and their emerging applications .",
    "the demands placed on a quantum memory will vary widely , depending on the desired application .",
    "many experimental implementations offer excellent performance in several key areas ; however , technical challenges remain to be overcome for practical use of most examples , whether in storage lifetime ; signal - to - noise ratio ; duty cycle ; efficiency ; or surfeit complexity , for example .",
    "the impressive progress of recent years gives a strong reason to believe that these challenges will be surmounted .",
    "in addition , it is desirable to design implementations that allow wavelength tunability , and the possibility of spectral- and spatial - multiplexing .",
    "incorporating multiple functionalities , such as precision temporal and spectral control , or wavelength conversion , into memory design will enable more versatile elements for photonic quantum information processing architectures .",
    "this is particularly important given the wavelength- and bandwidth - specificity of other quantum components such as sources and detectors .",
