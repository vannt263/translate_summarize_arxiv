    "is influenced by the topology of the network @xcite . a great need exists for the development of effective methods of inferring network structure from time series data ;",
    "a method for detecting the topology of dynamical networks , based on chaotic synchronization , has been proposed in @xcite ; a recent approach deals with the case of low number of samples and proposed methods rooted on l1 minimization @xcite .",
    "granger causality has become the method of choice to determine whether and how two time series exert causal influences on each other @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on prediction : if the prediction error of the first time series is reduced by including measurements from the second one in the linear regression model , then the second time series is said to have a causal influence on the first one .",
    "this frame has been used in many fields of science , including neural systems @xcite , reo - chaos @xcite and cardiovascular variability @xcite .",
    "the estimation of linear granger causality from fourier and wavelet transforms of time series data has been recently addressed @xcite .",
    "kernel algorithms work by embedding data into a hilbert space , and searching for linear relations in that space @xcite .",
    "the embedding is performed implicitly , by specifying the inner product between pairs of points @xcite .",
    "we have recently exploited the properties of kernels to provide nonlinear measures of bivariate granger causality @xcite .",
    "we reformulated linear granger causality and introduced a new statistical procedure to handle over - fitting @xcite in the linear case .",
    "our new formulation was then generalized to the nonlinear case by means of the kernel trick @xcite , thus obtaining a method with the following two main features : ( i ) the nonlinearity of the regression model can be controlled by choosing the kernel function ; ( ii ) the problem of false - causalities , which arises as the complexity of the model increases , is addressed by a selection strategy of the eigenvectors of a reduced gram matrix whose range represents the additional features due to the second time series .    in this paper",
    "we describe in detail the kernel granger approach and address use of granger causality to estimate , from multivariate time series data , the topology and the drive - response relationships of a dynamical network . to this aim ,",
    "we generalize our method in @xcite to the case of multivariate data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the kernel granger causality method in the bivariate case , adding some details to the presentation in @xcite . in section",
    "iii we generalize the method to process multivariate time series data , and show that the proposed method can discern whether an interaction is direct or mediated by a third time series .",
    "the case of dynamical networks is described in section iv : we analyze a system of interacting chaotic maps and a model of gene regulatory networks . in section",
    "v we consider systems with sparse connectivity and limited data , and compare the bivariate granger approach with a multivariate method based on l1 minimization ; then we analyze a real data set , gene expressions of hela cells .",
    "section v summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review the kernel method for granger causality proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us start with the linear case .",
    "suppose to model the temporal dynamics of a stationary time series @xmath1 by an autoregressive model of order @xmath2 : @xmath3 and by a bivariate autoregressive model which takes into account also a simultaneously recorded time series @xmath4 : @xmath5 the coefficients of the models are calculated by standard least squares optimization ; @xmath2 is usually chosen according to akaike criterion @xcite or embedding techniques from the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the concept of granger causality is @xcite : @xmath6 granger - causes @xmath7 if the variance of residuals @xmath8 is significantly smaller than the variance of residuals @xmath9 , as it happens when coefficients @xmath10 are jointly significantly different from zero .",
    "this can be tested by performing an f - test or levene s test for equality of variances @xcite .",
    "an index measuring the strength of the causal interaction is then defined as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 means averaging over @xmath13 ( note that @xmath14 ) .",
    "exchanging the roles of the two time series , one may equally test causality in the opposite direction , i.e. to check whether @xmath7 granger - causes @xmath6 .",
    "we use the shorthand notations : @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for @xmath18 .",
    "we treat these quantities as @xmath19 realizations of the stochastic variables @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "let us denote @xmath23 the @xmath24 matrix having vectors @xmath25 as columns , and @xmath26 the @xmath27 matrix having vectors @xmath28 as columns .",
    "the values of @xmath22 are organized in a vector @xmath29=@xmath30 . in full generality",
    "we assume that each component of @xmath20 and @xmath21 has zero mean , and that vector @xmath29 has zero mean and is normalized , i.e. @xmath31=@xmath32 .    now , for each @xmath18 , we define : @xmath33 @xmath34 the vectors @xmath35=@xmath36 and @xmath37=@xmath38 are the estimated values by linear regression , in the two cases .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath35 and @xmath37 have the following geometrical interpretation .",
    "let @xmath39 be the range of the @xmath40 matrix @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath35 is the projection of @xmath29 on @xmath42 . in other words , calling @xmath43 the ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors of @xmath44 with non - vanishing eigenvalue and @xmath45 the projector on the space @xmath42 , we have @xmath46 .",
    "let us define @xmath47 .",
    "analogously @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the projector on the @xmath50-dimensional space @xmath51 , equal to the range of the matrix @xmath52 . moreover , it is easy to show that @xmath53 now note that @xmath54 .",
    "therefore we may decompose @xmath55 as follows : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the space of all vectors of @xmath55 orthogonal to all vectors of @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath57 corresponds to the additional features due to the inclusion of @xmath58 variables .",
    "calling @xmath59 the projector on @xmath57 , we can write : @xmath60 now we note that @xmath57 is the range of the matrix @xmath61 indeed , for any @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "it follows that @xmath57 is spanned by the set of the eigenvectors , with non vanishing eigenvalue , of @xmath66 . calling @xmath67 these eigenvectors",
    ", we have : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the pearson s correlation coefficient of @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( since the overall sign of @xmath71 is arbitrary , we can assume that @xmath69 is positive ) .",
    "let @xmath72 be the probability that @xmath69 is due to chance , obtained by student s t test .",
    "since we are dealing with multiple comparison , we use the bonferroni correction to select the eigenvectors @xmath73 , correlated with @xmath70 , with expected fraction of false positive q ( equal to @xmath74 ) .",
    "therefore we calculate a new causality index by summing , in equation ( 4 ) , only over the @xmath75 such that @xmath76 , thus obtaining a _ filtered _ linear granger causality index : @xmath77 it is assumed that @xmath78 measures the causality @xmath79 , without further statistical test .      in this subsection",
    "we describe the generalization of linear granger causality to the nonlinear case , using methods from the theory of reproducing kernel hilbert spaces ( rkhs ) @xcite . given a kernel function @xmath80 , with spectral representation @xmath81 ( see mercer s theorem @xcite ) , we consider @xmath42 , the range of the @xmath40 gram matrix @xmath82 with elements @xmath83 . in order to make the mean of all variables @xmath84 zero , we replace @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the projector onto the one - dimensional subspace spanned by the vector such that each component is equal to the unity @xcite ; in the following we assume that this operation has been performed on each gram matrix .",
    "as in the linear case , we calculate @xmath35 , the projection of @xmath29 onto @xmath42 . due to the spectral representation of @xmath80 , @xmath35 coincides with the linear regression of @xmath29 in the feature space spanned by @xmath87 , the eigenfunctions of @xmath80 ; the regression is nonlinear in the original variables .",
    "while using both @xmath20 and @xmath21 to predict @xmath22 , we evaluate the gram matrix @xmath88 with elements @xmath89 .",
    "the regression values now form the vector @xmath37 equal to the projection of @xmath29 on @xmath55 , the range of @xmath88 . before evaluating the filtered causality index , as in the linear case , we note that not all kernels may be used to evaluate granger causality .",
    "indeed if @xmath21 is statistically independent of @xmath20 and @xmath22 , then @xmath37 and @xmath35 should coincide in the limit @xmath90 .",
    "this property , invariance of the risk minimizer when statistically independent variables are added to the set of input variables , is satisfied only by suitable kernels , as discussed in @xcite . in the following we consider two possible choices , which fulfill the invariance requirement .",
    "_ inhomogeneous polynomial kernel_. the inhomogeneous polynomial ( ip ) kernel of integer order @xmath91 is : @xmath92 in this case the eigenfunctions are made of all the monomials , in the input variables , up to the @xmath93 degree .",
    "the dimension of the space @xmath42 is @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the beta function , and @xmath96 corresponds to the linear regression .",
    "the dimension of space @xmath55 is @xmath97 . as in the linear case ,",
    "we note that @xmath54 and decompose @xmath56 .",
    "subsequently we calculate @xmath98 ; the dimension of the range of @xmath66 is @xmath99 . along the same lines as those described in the linear case",
    ", we construct the kernel granger causality taking into account only the eigenvectors of @xmath66 which pass the bonferroni test : @xmath100 the sum being only over the eigenvectors of @xmath66 with probability @xmath101 .    _",
    "gaussian kernel_. the gaussian kernel reads : @xmath102 and depends on the width @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath103 controls the complexity of the model : the dimension of the range of the gram matrix decreases as @xmath103 increases .",
    "as in previous cases , we may consider @xmath42 , the range of the gram matrix @xmath82 , and @xmath55 , the range of @xmath88 , but in this case the condition @xmath54 would not necessarily hold ; therefore some differences in the approach must be undertaken .",
    "we call @xmath104 the @xmath105-dimensional span of the eigenvectors of @xmath82 whose eigenvalue is not smaller than @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath82 and @xmath108 is a small number ( we use @xmath109 ) .",
    "we evaluate @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the projector on @xmath104 .",
    "after evaluating the gram matrix @xmath112 , the following matrix is considered : @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the eigenvectors of @xmath112 , and the sum is over the eigenvalues @xmath115 not smaller than @xmath108 times the largest eigenvalue of @xmath112 .",
    "then we evaluate @xmath116 , and denote @xmath59 the projector onto the @xmath117-dimensional range of @xmath66 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath118 may not be strictly satisfied in this case ( however in our experiments we find that the violation of this relation is always very small , if any ) .",
    "the kernel granger causality index for the gaussian kernel is then constructed as in the previous case , see equation ( [ causalityindex5 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath119 , @xmath120 , be @xmath121 simultaneously recorded time series . in order to put in evidence the drive - response pattern in this system",
    ", one may evaluate the bivariate granger causality , described in the previous sections , between every pair of time series .",
    "it is recommended , however , to treat the data - set as a whole , thus generalizing kernel granger causality to the multivariate case , as follows .",
    "we denote @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath18 . in order to evaluate the causality @xmath124",
    ", we define , for @xmath18 , @xmath125 containing all the input variables , and @xmath126 containing all the input variables but those related to @xmath127 . gram matrices @xmath82 and @xmath112 are then evaluated : @xmath128 and @xmath89 .",
    "the target vector is now @xmath29=@xmath129 . along the same lines as in the bivariate case , for ip kernel or the gaussian one",
    ", we then calculate the causality index as in equation ( 6 ) : it is denoted @xmath130 and measures the strength of causality @xmath131 , taking into account all the available variables . repeating these steps for all @xmath132 and @xmath133 ,",
    "the casuality pattern in the data set is evaluated .",
    "note that the threshold for the bonferroni s correction , in the multivariate case , must be lowered by the number of pairs @xmath134 .",
    "as an example , we consider the following system of three logistic maps @xcite : @xmath135 here @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 s are unit variance gaussian noise terms .",
    "the causal relationships implemented in these equations are @xmath139 and @xmath140 . analyzing segments of length @xmath141",
    ", we evaluate both the multivariate causality , as described in section 4 , and the bivariate causality for all pairs of maps .",
    "we use the ip kernel with various values of @xmath91 ; the results are displayed in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is well known @xcite that performing pairwise evaluation for multivariate data has the drawback that one can not discern whether the influence between two time series is direct or is mediated by other time series .",
    "this is what happens in the present example .",
    "both the multivariate and the bivariate analysis reveal the influences @xmath139 and @xmath140 . on the other hand , the bivariate analysis reveals also the influence @xmath142 , which is actually mediated by @xmath32 : the multivariate analysis recognizes @xmath142 as non - significative .",
    "in this section we simulate two dynamical networks and apply the multivariate granger analysis to estimate the topology structure of systems from time series data .",
    "let us consider a coupled map lattice of @xmath13 nodes , with equations , for @xmath143 : @xmath144 where @xmath132 , @xmath145 and @xmath138 s are the same as in equation ( [ map ] ) , and @xmath146 represents the coupling @xmath147 .",
    "we fix @xmath148 and construct couplings as follows .",
    "we consider the well known zachary data set @xcite , an undirected network of @xmath149 nodes .",
    "we assign a direction to each link , with equal probability , and set @xmath146 equal to 0.05 , for each link of the directed graph thus obtained , and zero otherwise .",
    "the network is displayed in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) : here the goal is to estimate this directed network from the measurements of time series on nodes .",
    "the multivariate granger analysis , described in the previous section , perfectly recovers the underlying network using the ip kernel with @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 . note that while evaluating @xmath153 , for all @xmath154 and @xmath155 , 39270 pearson s coefficients @xmath156 are calculated .",
    "their distribution is represented in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) : there is a strong peak at @xmath157 ( corresponding to projections that are discarded ) , and a very low number of projections with a rather large value of @xmath156 , up to about @xmath158 .",
    "it is interesting to describe the results in terms of a threshold for correlations . given a threshold value @xmath156 , we select the correlation coefficients whose value is greater than @xmath156 .",
    "we then calculate the corresponding causality indexes @xmath159 , and construct the directed network whose links correspond to non - vanishing elements of @xmath153 . in figure ( [ fig4])-top",
    "we plot the total number of links of the reconstructed network , as a function of the threshold @xmath156 : the curve shows a plateau , around @xmath160 , corresponding to a directed network which is stable against variations of @xmath156 . at the plateau @xmath161 projections",
    "are selected , which coincide with those selected by means of bonferroni s test . in figure ( [ fig4])-bottom",
    "we plot the number of errors ( the sum of the number of links that exist in the true network and are not recovered , plus the number of links that exist only in the recovered network ) versus the threshold @xmath156 : the plateau leads to perfect reconstruction of the original network . we stress that a large number of samples is needed to recover the underlying network : in the typical case we find that the network is perfectly reconstructed if @xmath162 , whilst if @xmath19 is further lowered some errors in the reconstructed network appear .",
    "moreover , it is important to observe that , although all couplings @xmath146 have the same magnitude , the causality strengths @xmath159 depend on the link , as it is shown in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "granger causality is a measure of the information being transferred from one time series to another , and it should not be identified with couplings .      in this subsection",
    "we consider time series from a model of genetic regulatory network made of genes linked by weighted connections ( inhibitory or excitatory ) @xcite .",
    "the expression levels of all genes , organized in a vector @xmath163 , evolve as follows : @xmath164 where @xmath165 is a connectivity strength matrix corresponding to the network , @xmath166 , @xmath167 is the identity matrix and @xmath168 is a vector of random variables uniform in @xmath169 $ ]",
    ". the values of @xmath163 are restricted by floor and ceiling function to range in @xmath170 $ ] : this constraint provides the nonlinear character of the model .",
    "as the simulation runs , multivariate data are sampled every @xmath171 time steps . moreover",
    ", the continuous data values are discretized into @xmath172 categories ( with equal bin sizes ) . in @xcite",
    "dynamic bayesian network ( dbn ) models @xcite were trained to data of length @xmath19 to recover the structure of matrix @xmath165 : the values @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 were found to lead to the best reconstruction of genetic networks by dbn .",
    "the genetic network we consider here is an example from @xcite and consists of ten genes with connections described in figure ( [ fig6 ] ) : there are two independent regulatory pathways , one of which includes a large feedback structure . in figure ( [ fig7 ] ) the typical curve of expression for a gene in the network",
    "is represented ( top ) ; the distribution of expressions , for the same gene , is bimodal ( bottom ) .",
    "we simulate 100 times the system equations , starting from different initial conditions , and sample time series of length @xmath176 , @xmath173 and @xmath177 .",
    "the typical recovered network by dbn , on this example , corresponds to one missing link ( from node 7 to 10 ) @xcite .",
    "the linear multivariate granger approach , with @xmath178 , leads to perfect reconstruction of the network in 90 cases out of the 100 ; we obtain similar results on all the examples presented in @xcite . using ip ( with @xmath179 ) and gaussian kernels we obtain similar performances as the ones from the linear kernel .",
    "it is interesting to stress that the possibility that one has to reconstruct the true genetic network depends on the sampling rate . in figure ( [ fig8 ] )",
    "we plot the mean number of errors ( over 100 realizations ) in the reconstructed network as a function of @xmath171 for the linear kernel and gaussian kernel : the performance degrades as @xmath171 gets far from 5 .",
    "let us now discuss the case of large @xmath171 : all granger causalities are recognized as non significative . on the other hand , at large @xmath171 , we find significant _",
    "static _ linear correlations between time series of all pairs of genes belonging to the same pathway . in other words , referring to figure ( [ fig6 ] ) , the linear correlations of times series from every pair of genes extracted from @xmath180 is significant , as well as the linear correlation for every pair extracted from @xmath181 ; consistently the linear correlation , for pairs of genes from different pathways , is not significant .",
    "we conclude that , at large @xmath171 granger causality analysis is not effective , but static correlation analysis may anyway put in evidence groups of genes belonging to the same regulatory pathway .",
    "the granger causality approach for dynamical networks here presented requires a large amount of data samples to provide trustable answers .",
    "however , there are situations ( frequent in bioinformatics ) where the number of samples is smaller than the number of variables ( genes ) : in these situations the multivariate granger approach is unfeasible . under the assumption of sparse connectivity",
    ", it has been proposed to replace least squares methodology with a multivariate approach using minimization with respect to @xmath0 norm @xcite . here",
    "we show that there are situations where , even in presence of sparse connectivity and limited data , use of bivariate granger causality is a better choice w.r.t @xmath0 minimization . indeed , in these cases",
    ", the statistical robustness of the estimation of information flow between pairs of time series may still be good , with the drawback that some causality links , found by the bivariate approach , may not be direct but mediated .",
    "we construct a network of @xmath182 nodes and @xmath182 links using the preferential attachment procedure @xcite ; we give randomly a direction to each link , with @xmath183 probabilities , thus obtaining a directed network .",
    "let us denote @xmath184 the number of nodes from which a link pointing to @xmath154 starts .",
    "we evolve a linear system on this network , with equations : @xmath185 the sum is over nodes such that @xmath147 is a link of the network ; @xmath138 s are unit variance gaussianly distributed noise terms ; @xmath186 is one , if @xmath187 , and @xmath188 otherwise . after a transient , we sample @xmath189 consecutive time points , with @xmath190 .",
    "the @xmath0 approach we use is the following .",
    "for each @xmath191 , we find the vector @xmath192 with minimum @xmath0 norm , among all those satisfying : @xmath193 @xmath194 .",
    "the interaction @xmath147 is considered significant if the absolute value of @xmath195 exceed a threshold , fixed so that the total number of false positive connections is five .",
    "subsequently we apply the bivariate linear granger approach , described in section iia , for each pair of nodes : also for granger s approach we fix a threshold for the correlation coefficients @xmath156 , see equation ( [ causalityindex3 ] ) , so that the total number of false positive connections is five . in figure ( [ fig9 ] )",
    "we depict the number of true positive connections found by the two approaches , as a function of @xmath189 .",
    "it is clear that here the bivariate granger approach outperforms @xmath0 minimization .",
    "hela is the most famous cell culture line to date @xcite .",
    "these are cells isolated from a human uterine cervical carcinoma in 1951 and used in biomedical research especially to culture viruses .",
    "whilst the patient ultimately died of her cancer eight months after the operation , her cells have lived on , still surviving in laboratories today .",
    "hela cells have somehow acquired cellular immortality , in that the normal mechanisms of programmed cell death after a certain number of divisions have somehow been switched off .",
    "we apply our approach to the hela cell gene expression data of @xcite .",
    "data corresponds to @xmath196 genes and @xmath197 time points , with an hour interval separating two successive readings ( the hela cell cycle lasts 16 hours ) .",
    "the 94 genes were selected , from the full data set described in @xcite , on the basis of the association with cell cycle regulation and tumor development .",
    "first of all , we perform the analysis of the static pairwise correlations between time series : 800 pairs of genes are significantly correlated .",
    "drawing a link for each correlated pair leads to an undirected network depicted in figure ( [ fig10 ] ) : it is clear that there are two modules , and symbols in figure ( [ fig10 ] ) corresponds to the partition by the method of module identification described in @xcite .",
    "the first module is made of 23 genes and corresponds to the regulatory network of the transcriptional factor nfkb @xcite ; it contains several well known activators and targets of nfkb @xcite , like , e.g. , a20 , icam-1 , il-6,vcam-1 , ikappaba , junb , mcp-1 , fgf2 , cyclin .",
    "the second module , 62 genes , appears to be orchestrated by transcriptional factors p53 and stat3 .",
    "note , however , that the two modules are not independent , as they form a highly related network .",
    "the proto - oncongene c - myc appears to be central between the two modules : it has 12 significant static correlations with both modules .",
    "after the discussion in section iv - b , we assume that the modular structure depicted in figure ( [ fig10 ] ) is the result of regulatory mechanisms acting on time scales much smaller than the sampling time .    next , in order to detect causalities acting on the time scale of the sampling time , we apply bivariate granger causality analysis . for all pairs @xmath198",
    ", we use the linear version ( @xmath96 , @xmath151 ) of our approach and evaluate the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath156 , equation ( [ causalityindex3 ] ) , for the causality @xmath199 . due to the small number of samples , we do not use t - test to evaluate the probability @xmath200 corresponding to @xmath156 : we generate a set of surrogates by permuting the temporal indices of the i - th times series while keeping fixed those of the j - th time series . the probability @xmath200 is identified with the fraction of times that an higher coefficient is obtained over @xmath201 random shufflings of time indices of the i-@xmath202 time series .",
    "moreover , we use the false discovery rate ( fdr ) method @xcite instead of bonferroni s correction .",
    "fdr works in the following way : the @xmath203 pearson coefficients are ordered , @xmath204 , according to their increasing @xmath205 values , and a parameter @xmath206 , which controls the fraction of false positive , is set to @xmath74 . the index @xmath207 is identified as the largest such that for all @xmath208 we have @xmath209 .",
    "pearson coefficients @xmath210 are accepted for @xmath211 .",
    "this procedure selects 19 causal relationships , out of 8742 ; they are listed in table i. ikappaba is the most abundant inhibitory protein for nfkb @xcite : our approach detects the significant causality ikappaba @xmath212 nfkb .",
    "we find that nfkb is also casually related to iap , an anti - apoptotic gene , and b99 ( a direct target for transcriptional activation by p53 : here no significant interaction between b99 and p53 has been detected ) .",
    "three causality relationships involve bcl - xl , the dominant regulator of apoptosis ( active cell suicide ) and tsp1 , a peptide shown in some tumor systems to be linked with angiogenesis .",

    "using an example consisting in a linear dynamical network on a graph grown by preferential attachment , we have shown that there are instances where the multivariate granger approach is unfeasible , but the application of bivariate granger analysis , to every pair of time series , leads to better results than those from a method based on l1 minimization .",

    "our result on hela data has very little overlap with those from the output of a method based on multivariate l1 minimization , but this is not surprising , as we observed the same fact also on the linear dynamical model of section v , where the true connectivity was known .",
