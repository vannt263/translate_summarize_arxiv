    "indeed , in three dimensions a bose system undergoes a famous bose - einstein condensation , its thermodynamic properties are well accounted by the mean free theory @xcite , while its hydrodynamics is governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation . on the other hand , in two dimensions and especially in one dimension fluctuations of the order parameter",

    "as is well known , a clean one - dimensional ( 1d ) system forms a strongly correlated ground state , so - called luttinger liquid ( ll ) .",
    "though this description holds for both , fermionic and bosonic systems , the bosonic character begets new properties in luttinger liquid state . to explore these features ,",
    "we consider landauer type setup shown in fig.[setup ] , where bosons are trapped in the system that consists of two reservoirs connected by a one dimensional `` wire '' .     as a function of coordinate ( lower panel ) . ]",
    "far - from - equilibrium realizations of landauer setup have been recently studied in the framework of correlated 1d electronic ( or , more generally , fermionic ) systems .",
    "the tunneling spectroscopy of the non - equilibrium carbon nanotube have been measured in ref .  .",
    "the thermal current in the edge state of qhe was studied in ref .  .",
    "on the theory side , one can distinguish several types of non - equilibrium setups , ranging from partially @xcite to fully non - equilibrium situations @xcite . in the partial - equilibrium setup ,",
    "electrons coming from different reservoirs have different values of chemical potential and temperature . in the case of full non - equilibrium ,",
    "electrons in the reservoirs are characterized by an arbitrary single - particle density matrix .",
    "remarkably , correlation functions of the interacting many - body problem can be calculated exactly even in the latter case , and can be cast in terms of fredholm determinants .    in this paper",

    "though at this moment we are not aware of any direct experimental realization of landauer - type setup for bosons , the idea seems experimentally feasible .",
    "indeed , the confinement of bosons to 1d optical wire has been accomplished in ref .. since the case of partial equilibrium seems to be more natural from the point of view of experimental realization , we focus on it in the current work .",
    "we assume that the interaction between the atoms is of a hard core type . inside the reservoirs it plays little role , and we approximate the atoms there as an ideal bose gas . inside the 1d `` wire '' connecting the reservoirs the hard core repulsion can not be neglected .",
    "we thus describe the system by ll with spatially varying interaction parameter @xmath1 , see fig.[setup ] .",
    "one of the key features distinguishing this bosonic setup from its fermionic counterpart is the absence of fermi surface . in other words ,",
    "the excitation spectrum of particles in the non - interacting regions of the system is quadratic .",
    "another interesting realization of excitations with quadratic spectrum are transverse spin waves in a ferromagnetic bose gas@xcite .",
    "the non - linearity of the excitation spectrum is known to have a significant impact on the properties of the ll . in the fermionic case it leads to a number of interesting and important effects ,",
    "see refs .   for reviews .",
    "however , for most characteristics of low - temperature dynamics of correlated electronic systems such non - linearity can be discarded .",
    "this is done indeed in the case of the standard ll model . in the present situation ,",
    "the spectrum for weak interaction is not linear even in the leading approximation .",
    "this should be accounted for in the corresponding theory and may be expected to profoundly affect the results of our analysis .    to deal with a non - linear dispersion of the spectrum in the bosonic case , we use the so - called harmonic approximation @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this approach accurately describes the system in both the `` quasi - condensate '' ( weakly interacting bose gas ) and the ll ( sufficiently strong repulsive interaction ) regimes . within this framework , we study the thermal current and single - particle green functions .",
    "the latter contain information about the density of states and the distribution function of bosons , as well as about information about phase - coherence correlations that are probed in interference experiments @xcite .",

    "this divergence signals that the harmonic approximation is not a suitable framework to calculate the particle current . indeed , while developing the harmonic approximation we took the @xmath172 limit , assuming that characteristic energies of the collective excitations are much greater than the chemical potential . while this assumption is valid for the thermal current and the single - particle green function it does not hold for the particle current of the free bosons . to cure this problem",

    "while the limits discussed above give us some idea about the particle current , this problem remains to be solved for bosons that do interact in the wire ( @xmath210 ) , but do not interact in the leads ( @xmath201 ) . in particular , it remains to be seen whether the value of particle current in this case is affected by interaction inside the system . to answer this question",
