    "a lesson of the physics of the last century is that , up here , on length scales much greater than the planck length , the world is four - dimensional with a classical spacetime geometry .",
    "there is neither a unique notion of space nor a unique notion of time .",
    "rather , at each point in spacetime there are a family of timelike directions and three times as many spacelike directions . yet , in this four - dimensional world , we divide our subjective experience up into past , present , and future .",
    "these seem very different .",
    "we experience the present , remember the past , and predict the future .",
    "how is our experience organized in this way ?",
    "why is it so organized ?",
    "what is the four - dimensional description of our past , present , and future ? is this the only way experience can be organized ?",
    "this paper is concerned with such questions .",
    "the general laws of physics by themselves provide no answers .",
    "past , present , and future are not properties of four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "rather , they are properties of a specific class of subsystems of the universe that can usefully be called _ information gathering and utilizing systems _ ( iguses ) @xcite .",
    "the term is broad enough to include both single representatives of biological species that have evolved naturally and mechanical robots that were constructed artificially .",
    "it includes human beings both individually and collectively as members of groups , cultures , and civilizations .    to understand past , present , and future it is necessary to understand how an igus employs such notions in the processing of information . to understand why it is organized in this way it is necessary to understand how it is constructed and ultimately how it evolved .",
    "questions about past , present , and future therefore are most naturally the province of psychology , artificial intelligence , evolutionary biology , and philosophy .",
    "however , questions concerning past , present , and future can not be completely divorced from physics . for instance",
    ", the notions must be describable in four - dimensional terms just to be consistent with the fundamental picture of spacetime .",
    "further , as we will review , the distinctions between the past , present , and future of an igus depend upon some of the arrows of time that our universe exhibits such as that summarized by the second law of thermodynamics . in the tradition of theoretical physics , we illustrate these connections with simple models of an igus  achieving clarity at the risk of irrelevance .",
    "our considerations are entirely based on classical physics .",
    "one such model igus  a robot  is described in section [ ii ] .",
    "it is simple enough to be easily analyzed , but complex enough to suggest how realistic iguses distinguish between past , present , and future .",
    "the four - dimensional description of this robot is discussed in section [ iii ] . there",
    "we will see that the robot s present is not a moment in spacetime .",
    "rather , there is a present at each instant along the robot s world line consisting of its most recently acquired data about its external environment . the approximate common notion of ` now ' that could be utilized by a collection of nearby robots moving slowly with respect to one another",
    "is also described .",
    "section [ iv ] describes the connection of present , past and future with the thermodynamic arrow of time and the radiation arrow of time .",
    "it seeks to answer the question ,  could we construct a robot that would remember the future ?",
    "\" section [ v ] describes alternative organizations of a robot s experience that are different from past , present , and future .",
    "these are consistent with the four - dimensional laws of physics .",
    "but the possibility of these alternative organizations shows that past , present , and future are not consequences of these laws .",
    "we speculate , however , that , as a consequence of the laws of physics , the past , present , and future organization may offer an evolutionary advantage over the other modes of organization .",
    "this supports a conjecture that past , present , and future may be a cognitive universal @xcite for sufficiently localized iguses .",
    "imagine constructing a robot which gathers and utilizes information in the following manner ( figure 1 ) :    .10 in _ information gathering : _ the robot has @xmath0 memory locations @xmath1 which we call ` registers ' for short .",
    "these contain a time series of images of its external environment assembled as follows : at times separated by intervals @xmath2 the image in register @xmath3 is erased and replaced by the image in @xmath4 .",
    "then the image in @xmath4 is erased and replaced by the image in @xmath5 , and so on .",
    "for the last step , the robot captures a new image of its external environment and stores it in register @xmath6 .",
    "thus , at any one time , the robot possesses a coarse - grained image history of its environment extending over a time @xmath7 .",
    "the most recent image is in @xmath6 ; the oldest is in @xmath3 . .10 in _ information utilization : _ the robot employs the information in the registers @xmath1 to compute predictions about its environment at times to the future of the data in @xmath6 and direct its behavior based upon these predictions .",
    "it does this in two steps employing two different processes of computation :    * : the robot s memory stores a simplified model of its environment containing , not all the information in @xmath1 , but only those parts important for the robot s functioning .",
    "this model is called a _",
    "schema _ @xcite .",
    "each time interval @xmath2 , the robot updates its schema making use of the information in @xmath6 by a process of computation we denote by @xmath8 .",
    "+ the schema might contain the locations and trajectories of food , predators , obstacles to locomotion , fellow robots , etc .",
    "it might contain hard - wired rules for success ( _ e.g. _ get food  yes , be food  no ) and perhaps even crude approximations to the rules of geometry and the laws of physics ( _ e.g. _ objects generally fall down ) .",
    "it might contain summaries of regularities of the environment abstracted from the information gathered long before the period covered by registers @xmath9 or explained to it by other robots , etc .",
    "* : each time interval @xmath2 the robot uses its schema and the fresh image in @xmath6 to assess its situation , predict the future , and make decisions on what behavior to exhibit next by a process of computation that we denote by @xmath10 .",
    "this is distinct from @xmath8 .",
    "the important point for this paper is that the robot directly employs only the most recently acquired image in register @xmath6 in this process of computation @xmath10 .",
    "the information in @xmath11 is employed only through the schema .",
    "it seems possible that such a robot could be constructed . as a model of sophisticated iguses such as ourselves",
    "it is grossly oversimplified .",
    "yet , it possesses a number of features that are similar to those in sophisticated iguses that are relevant for understanding past , present , and future : the robot has a coarse - grained memory of its external environment contained in registers @xmath1 .",
    "the robot has two processes of computation , @xmath10 and @xmath8 . without entering into the treacherous issue of whether the robot is conscious ,",
    "the two processes have a number of similarities with our own processes of conscious and unconscious computation :    * @xmath8 computation provides input to decision - making @xmath10 computation .",
    "* there is direct input to @xmath10 computation only from the most recently acquired image in the register @xmath6 .",
    "the images in @xmath11 affect @xmath10 only through the schema computed in @xmath8 .",
    "* information flows into and out from the register @xmath6 directly used by @xmath10 .",
    "equally evident are some significant differences between the robot and ourselves .",
    "our information about the external environment is not exclusively visual , it is not stored in a linear array of registers , nor is it transferred from one to the other in the simple manner described .",
    "input and records are not separated by sharp time divisions .",
    "we can consciously access memories of other than the most recent data , although often imperfectly and after modification by unconscious computation .",
    "this list of differences can easily be extended , but that should not obscure the similarities discussed above .    the analogies between the robot and ourselves can be emphasized by employing everyday subjective terminology to describe the robot .",
    "for example , we will call @xmath10 and @xmath8 computation ` conscious ' and ` unconscious ' secure in the confidence that such terms can be eliminated in favor of the mechanical description we have employed up to this point if necessary for clarity . proceeding in this way",
    ", we can say that the robot ` observes ' its environment .",
    "the register @xmath6 contains a record of the ` present ' , and the registers @xmath12 are records of the ` past ' to _ define _ the past .",
    "section [ iv ] will connect this notion of past with other physical notions of ` past ' , that defined by the the time direction toward the big bang for instance .",
    "when the register @xmath3 is erased , the robot has ` forgotten ' its contents .",
    "the present extends over a finite interval can be taken to be of order the @xmath13s separation time needed discriminate between two visual signals @xcite . ] @xmath2 .",
    "the robot has conscious focus on the present , but only access to the past through the records that are inputs to the unconscious computation of its schema .",
    "the robot can thus be said to ` experience ' the present and ` remember ' the past .",
    "the ` flow of time ' is the movement of information into the register of conscious focus and out again .",
    "prediction requires computation  either conscious or unconscious  from memories of the present and past acquired by observation and is thus distinct from remembering .",
    "the subjective past , present , and future , the flow of time , and the distinction between predicting and remembering are represented concretely and physically in the structure and function of the model robot .",
    "we now proceed to describe this structure and function in four - dimensional terms .",
    "this section gives the four - dimensional , spacetime description of the robot specified in the previous section .",
    "for simplicity we consider the flat spacetime of special relativity ( minkowski space ) . but with little change it could be a curved spacetime of general relativity .",
    "we begin by recalling a few important features of four - dimensional spacetime that are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "events occur at points in spacetime . at each point",
    "@xmath14 there is a _ light cone _ consisting of two parts .",
    "the future light cone is the three - dimensional surface generated by the light rays emerging from @xmath14 .",
    "the past light cone is similarly defined by the light rays converging on @xmath14 .",
    "( the labels ` future ' and ` past ' are conventions at this point in the discussion . in section [ iv ] we will define them in the cosmological context . ) points inside the light cone of @xmath14 are timelike separated from it ; points outside the light cone are spacelike separated .",
    "points inside the future light cone of @xmath14 are in its future ; points inside the past light cone are in its past .",
    "points outside the light cone are neither .",
    "the center of mass of a localized igus , such as the robot of the previous section , describes a timelike world line in spacetime . at each point along the world line , any tangent to it lies inside the light cone so that the igus is moving at less than the speed of light in any inertial frame .",
    "a moment in time is a three - dimensional spacelike surface in spacetime  one in which any two nearby points are spacelike separated .",
    "each spacelike surface divides spacetime into two regions  one to its future and one to its past .",
    "a family of spacelike surfaces such that each point in spacetime lies on one and only member of the family specifies a division of spacetime into space and time .",
    "the family of surfaces defined by constant values of the time of a particular inertial frame is an example ( e.g. the surfaces of constant @xmath15 in figures 2 - 4 ) .",
    "different families of spacelike surfaces define different notions of space and different notions of time none of which is preferred over the other .",
    "figure 3 shows the world line of the robot introduced in section [ ii ] together with the world line of an object in its environment that appears in the robot s stored images .",
    "the robot illustrated has a short memory with only four registers @xmath16 whose contents in each interval @xmath2 are indicated by the content of the boxes to the right of the world line .",
    "these contents change at proper time intervals @xmath2 as described in section [ ii ] .",
    "the contents of the register @xmath6 defining the robot s present do not define a spacelike surface representing a moment in time .",
    "they do not even define an instant along the robot s world line since the contents of @xmath6 are consistent over proper time intervals @xmath2 .",
    "rather , there is content defining the present for _ every _ instant along the world line . for each point along the world line the most recently acquired image defines the present .",
    "that is the four - dimensional description of the present . in a similar way",
    ", the data acquired earlier and stored in registers @xmath17 define the robot s past for each point along the world line .",
    "thus , there is no conflict between the four - dimensional reality of physics and the subjective past , present , and future of an igus . indeed , as defined above , the subjective past , present , and future _ are _ four - dimensional notions .",
    "they are not properties of spacetime but of the history of a particular igus . in section [ v ]",
    "we will see that iguses constructed differently from our robot could have different notions of past , present , and future .",
    "all of these are fully consistent with a four - dimensional physical reality",
    ".    however , there _ is _ a conflict between ordinary language and the four - dimensional , igus - specific notions of past , present , and future .",
    "to speak of the `` present moment '' of an igus , for instance , risks confusion because it could be construed to refer to a spacelike surface in spacetime stretching over the whole universe .",
    "no such surface is defined by physics .",
    "making lorentz invariance at accessible energy scales one of the most accurately tested principles in physics . see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "] in fact , the `` moment '' in the context of this section refers to the most recently acquired data of an igus .",
    "this is not a notion restricted to one point on the igus world line which somehow moves along it .",
    "rather is a notion present at _ every _ point along the world line .",
    "the previous discussion has concerned the present , past , and future of individual localized iguses .",
    "we now turn to the notion of a common present that may be held by collections of iguses separated in space .",
    "when someone asked yogi berra what time it was , he is reported to have replied `` do you mean now ? ''",
    "the laughter usually evoked by this anecdote shows how strongly we hold a common notion of the present .",
    "more precisely , different iguses agree on ` what is happening now ' .",
    "this section is concerned with the limitations on the accuracy of that agreement arising both from the construction of the iguses and the limitations of defining simultaneity in special relativity .",
    "we continue to use robot model iguses to make the discussion concrete .",
    "figure 4 shows the world lines of two robots in spacetime together with the intervals on their world lines that define their individual notions of ` now ' .",
    "there are at least two reasons that there is no unambiguous notion of a common ` now ' that can be shared by the two robots .",
    "the first is the elementary observation that the present for each individual robot is not defined to an accuracy better than @xmath2 .",
    "the second reason arises from special relativity .",
    "a precise common ` now ' would specify a correspondence between events on the two world lines .",
    "such a correspondence would specify a notion of simultaneity between events on the world lines .",
    "but there is no unique notion of simultaneity provided by special relativity .",
    "rather there are many different notions corresponding to the different possible spacelike surfaces that can intersect the two world lines .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the range of ambiguity .    to illustrate the ambiguity of the present more dramatically ,",
    "imagine you are a newscaster on the capital planet trantor of a galaxy - wide empire some hundreds of thousands of years in the future .",
    "news of events all over the galaxy pour in constantly via electromagnetic signals .",
    "you want to broadcast a program called ` the galaxy today ' reviewing important events in the last 24 hours ( galactic standard ) .",
    "but what time do you assign to the latest news from the planet terminus at the edge of the galaxy 60,000 light years away ?",
    "there is an inertial frame with respect to the galactic rest frame such that @xmath18\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20hrs , @xmath21yr , and @xmath22 light years .",
    "the required velocity is within a few parts in @xmath23 of the velocity of light . ]",
    "in which those events happened within the last 24 hours .",
    "but in the approximate rest frame of the galaxy , they happened 60,000 years ago .",
    "there is thus no unambiguous notion of ` present ' for the collective igus consisting of the citizens of the galactic empire because the ambiguities in defining simultaneity are large compared to the time scales on which human events happen .",
    "you could , of course , fix on the time of the galactic rest frame as a standard for simultaneity .",
    "but in that case the only comprehensive program you could broadcast would be ` the galaxy 60,000 years ago ' .",
    "one imagines the audience for this on terminus would not be large since the program would be seen 120,000 years after the events there happened .",
    "the satellites comprising the global positioning system are an example of a collective igus closer to home that faces a similar problem .",
    "the special relativistic ambiguity in defining simultaneity for two satellites is of order the light travel time between them in the approximate inertial frame in which the earth is at rest .",
    "that is much larger than the light travel time across the few meters accuracy to which the system aims to locate events .",
    "precise agreement on a definition of simultaneity is therefore needed . each satellite clock",
    "is corrected so that it broadcasts the time of a clock on the earth s geoid ( approximately the ocean surface ) @xcite .",
    "no such agreement on a definition of simultaneity appears to be a prerequisite for the everyday notion of ` now ' employed by human iguses .",
    "rather , we seem to be employing an approximate , imprecise notion of the common present appropriate in everyday situations and characterized by the following contingencies :    1 .   the time scale of perception @xmath2 is short compared to the time scales on which interesting features of the environment vary",
    "individual iguses are moving relatively to one another at velocities small compared to @xmath24 .",
    "the light travel time between iguses in an inertial frame in which they are nearly at rest is small compared to the time scales @xmath2 .",
    "contingency ( 1 ) means that the ambiguity in the ` now ' of each igus is negligible in the construction of a common present .",
    "contingency ( 3 ) , based on ( 2 ) , means that the ambiguity arising from the definition of simultaneity is negligible .",
    "collections of robots satisfying contingencies 1 - 3 can agree on what is happening ` now ' .",
    "consider just two robots  alice and bob .",
    "alice can send bob a description of the essential features of the image currently in her register @xmath6 .",
    "bob can check whether these essential features are the same as those of the image in his register @xmath6 at the time of receipt .",
    "he can then signal back agreement or disagreement .",
    "as long as the light travel time is much shorter than @xmath2 ( contingency 3 ) , and as long as the essential features vary on much longer time scales ( contingency 1 ) alice and bob will agree . contingency 2 ensures that this agreement will persist over an interesting time scale .",
    "thus alice and bob can construct a common present , but it is a present that is local , inherently approximate , and contingent upon their relation to each other and their environment .",
    "this approximate common ` now ' is not a surface in spacetime .",
    "no modification of the laws of physics is needed to understand the common now of a group of iguses as has sometimes been suggested @xcite .",
    "the common nows of iguses meeting the above contingencies will coincide approximately with constant time surfaces in any inertial frame in which they are approximately at rest .",
    "but these frames are not singled out by the laws of physics .",
    "indeed , the experimental evidence against preferred frames is special relativity is extraordinarily good @xcite .",
    "rather the frames are singled out by the particular situations of the iguses themselves",
    "the fundamental dynamical laws of physics are invariant under time reversal to an accuracy adequate for organizing everyday experience .",
    "time neutral_. the einstein equation of general relativity and maxwell s equations for electrodynamics are examples .",
    "but the boundary conditions specifying solutions to these equations describing our universe are not time symmetric .",
    "the universe has a smooth ( near homogeneous and isotropic ) big bang at one end of time and a very different condition at the other end .",
    "this might be the unending expansion driven by a cosmological constant of the simplest cosmological models favored by observation @xcite . or with different assumptions on the matter it could be a highly irregular big crunch . in any event",
    ", one end is different from the other .",
    "_ by convention , this paper refers throughout to the times closer to the big bang as the ` past ' and times further away as the ` future ' . _",
    "asymmetry between past and future boundary conditions is the origin of the various time asymmetries  ` arrows of time '  exhibited by our universe .",
    "the arrow of time associated with the second law of thermodynamics is an example    the operation of section [ ii ] s robot is not time neutral in at least two respects .",
    "first the robot receives information about external events in its past ( closer to the big bang ) and not the future.a . ] .",
    "second , its processing of the received information is not time neutral .",
    "the flow of information from recording to erasure defines a direction in time . as mentioned in section [ ii ] , that direction gives a concrete model for the subjective feeling of inexorable forward progression in time commonly called the ` psychological arrow of time ' . in natural iguses , such as ourselves ,",
    "information flows from past to future .",
    "more specifically the records in registers @xmath11 are of external events to the _ past _ of those in @xmath6 in decreasing order of time from the big bang .",
    "this is the reason that section [ ii ] s robot could be said to experience the present , remember the past , and predict the future we _ defined _ the robot s past to be the records in the registers @xmath11 .",
    "if information flows from past to future in the robot , that notion coincides with the physical past defined as the direction in time towards the big bang . from now on we assume this congruence except where discussing its possible violation , as in this section . ]",
    "could a robot be constructed that receives information from the future ? could one be constructed whose psychological arrow of time runs from future to past with the consequence that it would remember the future ? both of these possibilities are consistent with time neutral dynamical laws .",
    "but two familiar time asymmetries of our universe prohibit such constructions as a practical matter .",
    "these are the radiation arrow of time and the arrow of time associated with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "records of the future _ are _ possible as in a table of future lunar eclipses .",
    "indeed , records of the future are the outcome of any useful process of prediction .",
    "but , our robot s records of the future are obtained by computation , whereas its records of the past are created by simple , automatic , sensory mechanisms .",
    "these are very different processes both physically and from the point of view of information processing by the robot . by a robot that remembers the future ,",
    "we mean one constructed we will describe a different construction of a robot which could be said to remember the future . ] as in section [ ii ] with the records in registers @xmath11 of events to the future of @xmath6 .",
    "first consider the question of whether information from the future could be recorded by the robot . in our universe",
    ", electromagnetic radiation is retarded  propagating to the future of its emission event .",
    "that time asymmetry is the radiation arrow of time .",
    "the electromagnetic signals recorded by the robot propagated to it along the _ past _ light cone of the reception event .",
    "the images received by the robot , whether of the cosmic background radiation , distant stars and galaxies , or the happenings in its immediate environment , are therefore all from past events . as far as we know ,",
    "all other carriers , neutrinos for example @xcite , are similarly retarded .",
    "one reason the robot does nt remember the future is that it receives no information about it .    irrespective of the time its input originates , could a robot like that in section [ ii ] be constructed whose psychological arrow of time is reversed , so that internally information flows from future to past ? in such a robot the events recorded in registers @xmath11 would lie to the future of that in @xmath6  further from the big bang",
    ". the robot would thus remember the future .",
    "such a construction would run counter to the arrow of time specified by the second law of thermodynamics as we now review .",
    "all isolated subsystems of the universe evolve toward equilibrium .",
    "that is statistics .",
    "but the preponderance of isolated systems in our universe are evolving toward equilibrium from past to future , defining an arrow of time . that is the second law of thermodynamics that is expressed quantitatively by the inexorable increase of an appropriately defined total entropy .",
    "if the robot processes information irreversibly then its psychological arrow of time must generally be congruent with the thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "the formation of records are crucial steps .",
    "an increase in total entropy accompanies the formation of many realistic records .",
    "an impact crater in the moon , an ancient fission track in mica , a darkened photographic grain , or the absorption of a photon by the retina are all examples .",
    "but an increase in total entropy is not a necessary consequence of forming a record .",
    "entropy increase is necessary only on the erasure of a record @xcite . for the model robot discussed in section [ ii ] , the only part of its operation in which entropy must necessarily increase is in the erasure of the contents of the register @xmath3 at each step .",
    "however , that is enough . to see that ,",
    "imagine the process of erasure run backwards from future to past",
    ". it would be like bits of smashed shell reassembling to form an egg .    to construct a robot with a reversed psychological arrow of time it would be necessary to reverse the thermodynamic arrow , not only of the robot , but also of the local environment",
    "it is observing . that is possible in principle .",
    "however , since we have a system of matter coupled to electromagnetic radiation , it would be necessary to deal with every molecule and photon within a radius of @xmath25 km to reverse the system for a day .",
    "more advanced civilizations may find this amusing .",
    "we can have the same fun more cheaply by running the film through the projector in reverse .",
    "the origin of both the thermodynamic and radiation arrows of time are the time - asymmetric boundary conditions that single out our universe from the many allowed by time - reversible dynamical laws .",
    "these boundary conditions connect the two arrows .",
    "a brief sketch of the relevant physics is given in the appendix , although it is not necessary for understanding the main argument of this paper .",
    "but it is interesting to think that our subjective distinction between future and past can ultimately be traced to the cosmological boundary conditions that distinguish the future and past of the universe .",
    "the preceding discussion suggests that the laws of physics do not define unambiguous notions of past , present , and future by themselves",
    ". rather these are features of how specific iguses gather and utilize information .",
    "what then is the origin of the past , present , and future organization of information in familiar , naturally - occurring iguses ?",
    "is it the only organization compatible with the laws of physics ?",
    "if not , does it arise uniquely from evolutionary imperatives , or is it a frozen accident that took place in the course of three billion years of biological evolution ? this section discusses such questions .",
    "certainly some features of the laws of physics are essential prerequisites to the functioning of section [ ii ] s robot",
    ". there would be no past , present , and future at all if spacetime did not have timelike directions .",
    "the fact that iguses move on timelike rather than spacelike world lines is the main part of the reason they can have an approximate common ` now ' rather than an approximate common ` here ' .",
    "an igus functioning in a spacetime where it moved along a closed timelike curve could not maintain a consistent notion of past and future .",
    "likewise , a local distinction between past and future would be difficult to maintain in the absence of the arrows of time discussed in section [ ii ] .",
    "but the features of the physical laws of dynamics and the initial condition of the universe that are necessary for a past , present , future organization of temporal information are consistent with other organizations of this information as we now show .",
    "perhaps the easiest way of convincing oneself that the notions of past , present , and future do not follow from the laws of physics is to imagine constructing robots that process information differently from the one described in section [ ii ] .",
    "we consider just three examples :    _ the split screen ( ss ) robot .",
    "_ this robot has input to @xmath10 computation from both the most recently acquired data in @xmath6 and from that in a different register @xmath26 that was acquired a proper time @xmath27 earlier along its world line .",
    "there is thus input to conscious computation from _ two _ times .    _",
    "the always behind ( ab ) robot .",
    "_ this robot has input to @xmath10 computation only from a particular register @xmath28 and the schema . that input is thus always a proper time @xmath29 _ behind _ the most recently acquired data .    _ the no schema ( ns ) robot . _",
    "this robot has input to @xmath10 computation from all the registers @xmath30 equally .",
    "it employs no unconscious computation and constructs no schema , but rather takes decisions by conscious computation from all the data it has .",
    "there seems to be no obstacle to constructing robots wired up in these ways , and they process information differently from the present , past , and future organization that we are familiar with case , or in which there was an actual split screen as in the @xmath31 case .",
    "an alternative realization of the @xmath31 robot s experience might be produced by electrical stimulation of the cortex that evokes memories of the past which are comparably immediate to the present @xcite . ] .",
    "an @xmath31 robot would have a tripartite division of recorded information .",
    "its present experience  its ` now '  would consist of two times ( @xmath6 , @xmath26 )  equally vivid and immediate .",
    "it would ` remember ' the intermediate times ( @xmath32 ) , and the past ( @xmath33 ) through the @xmath8 process of computation and its influence on the schema .",
    "the @xmath34 robot would also have a tripartite division of recorded information .",
    "its present experience would be the contents of the the register @xmath35 .",
    "it would remember the past stored in registers @xmath36 .",
    "but also , it would remember its future stored @xmath37 a time @xmath38 ahead of its present experience because each record is still of events in the past to the proper time it was recorded . ] .",
    "( or perhaps we should say that it would have premonitions of the future . )",
    "what would discussions with an @xmath34 robot be like assuming that our information processing is similar to the robot discussed in section [ ii ] ? assume for simplicity that we and the @xmath34 robot are both nearly at rest in one inertial frame and that contingencies 1 ) through 3 ) of section [ s3 ] are satisfied . the @xmath34 robot would seem a little slow  responding in a time @xmath38 or longer to questions .",
    "its answers to queries about `` what s happening now ? '' would seem out of date",
    ". it would be always behind .",
    "the @xmath39 robot would just have one category of recorded information .",
    "conversations with an @xmath39 robot would be impressive since it would recall every detail it has recorded about the past as immediately and vividly as the present .",
    "the laws of physics supply no obstacle of principle to the construction of robots with exotic organizations of information processing such as the @xmath31 , @xmath34 , and @xmath39 robots . but",
    "are such organizations a likely outcome of biological evolution ?",
    "can we expect to find such iguses in nature in this or other planets ?",
    "we speculate that we will not .",
    "it is adaptive for an igus of everyday size to focus mainly on the most recently acquired data as input to making decisions",
    ". the effective low - energy laws of physics in our universe are _ local _ in spacetime and the nearest data in space and time is usually the most relevant for what happens next .",
    "a frog predicting the future position of a fly needs the present position and velocity of the fly , not its location 10s ago .",
    "an @xmath34 frog would be at a great competitive disadvantage in not focusing on the most current information .",
    "an @xmath31 frog would be wasting precious conscious focus on data from the past that is less relevant for immediate prediction than current data .",
    "an @xmath39 robot is making inefficient use of computing resources in giving equal focus to present data and data from the past whose details may not effect relevant future prediction .",
    "employing a schema to process the data is plausibly adaptive because is a more efficient and faster way of processing data with limited computing resources .",
    "the collective igus linked by human culture certainly evolved to make use of schema rather than focus on the individual records that went into them .",
    "for instance , prediction of the future of the universe is much simpler from a friedman - robertson - walker model characterized by a few cosmological parameters than directly from the records of the measurements that determined them .",
    "something like the @xmath31 organization of temporal information might be favored by evolution if the laws of physics were not local in time .",
    "suppose , for example , that the position of objects to the future of a time @xmath40 depended}{2h^2}.\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the body s position , @xmath42 its mass , and @xmath43 the force . however , such equations are not consistent with special relativity and the author is not suggesting a serious investigation of alternatives to newtonian mechanics . ] , not just on the force acting and their position and velocity at that time , but rather on their position at time @xmath40 and on earlier times @xmath44 and @xmath45 for some fundamental fixed time interval @xmath46 .",
    "then an organization such as the @xmath31 robot with conscious focus on both the most recently acquired data and that acquired at times @xmath46 and @xmath47 ago might be favored by evolution .",
    "similarly different organizations might evolve if the igus is not smaller than the scale over which light travels on the characteristic times of relevant change in its environment .",
    "the present , past , future organization is unlikely to serve such an igus well because these notions are not well defined in these situations , as discussed in section [ iii].c . as mentioned there",
    ", the galactic empires beloved of science fiction would be examples of such iguses .",
    "faster - than - light travel inconsistent with special relativity is often posited by authors whose stories feature these empires to make their narratives accessible to iguses like ourselves that do employ  however , approximately  a present , past , and future organization of information .",
    "a subjective past , present , and future are not the only conceivable way an igus can organize temporal data in a four - dimensional physical world consistently with the known laws of physics .",
    "but it is a way that may be adaptive for localized iguses governed by local physical laws .",
    "we can conjecture that a subjective past , present , and future is a cognitive universal @xcite of such localized iguses .",
    "that is a statement accessible to observational test , at least in principle .",
    "the author thanks murray gell - mann for discussions of complex adaptive systems over a long period of time .",
    "he is grateful to terry sejnowski and roger shepard for information about the literature in psychology that bears on the subject of this paper .",
    "special thanks are due to roger shepard for an extended correspondence on these issues .",
    "communications with jeremy butterfield , craig callender and matt davidson have been similarly helpful with parts of the philosophical literature",
    ". however , the responsibility rests with the author for any deficiencies in providing relevant references to the vast literatures of these subjects of which he is largely ignorant .",
    "research for this work was supported in part by the national science foundation under grant phy02 - 44764 .",
    "the origin of our universe s time asymmetries is not to be found in the fundamental dynamical laws which are essentially time - reversible .",
    "rather , both the radiation and the thermodynamic arrows of time arise from special properties of the initial condition of our universe .",
    "this appendix gives a simplified discussion of these special features starting , not at the very beginning , but at the time the hot initial plasma had become cool enough to be transparent to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "this is the time of `` decoupling '' in cosmological parlance  about 400,000 years after the big bang or a little over 13 billion years ago .",
    "as boltzmann put it over a century ago : `` the second law of thermodynamics can be proved from the [ time - reversible ] mechanical theory if one assumes that the present state of the universe   started to evolve from an improbable [ _ i.e. _ special ] state '' @xcite .",
    "the entropy of matter and radiation usually defined in physics and chemistry is about @xmath48 in the region visible from today at the time of decoupling ( in units of boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "this seems high , but it is in fact vastly smaller than the maximal value of about @xmath49 if all that matter was dumped into a black hole @xcite .",
    "the entropy of the matter early in the universe is high because most constituents are in approximate thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , the gravitational contribution of the smooth early universe to the entropy is near minimal , and entropy can grow by the clumping of the matter arising from gravitational attraction leading to the galaxies , stars and other inhomogeneities in the universe we see today .    amplifying on boltzmann s statement above",
    ", the explanation of why the entropies of isolated subsystems are mostly increasing in the same direction of time is this : the progenitors of these isolated systems were all further out of equilibrium at times closer to the big bang ( the past ) than they are today .",
    "earlier the total entropy was low compared to what it could have been .",
    "it has therefore has tended to increase since .",
    "the radiation arrow of time can also be understood as arising from time - asymmetric cosmological boundary conditions applied to time - reversible dynamical laws .",
    "these are maxwell s equations for the electromagnetic field in the presence of charged sources .",
    "their time - reversal invariance implies that _ any _ solution for specified sources at a moment of time can be written at in _ either _ of two ways : ( r ) a sum of a free field ( no sources ) coming from the past plus _ retarded _ fields whose sources are charges in the past , or ( a ) a sum of a free field coming from the future plus _ advanced _ fields whose sources are charges in the future .",
    "more quantitatively , the four - vector potential @xmath50 at a point @xmath51 in spacetime can be expressed in the presence of four - current sources @xmath52 in lorentz gauge as either @xmath53 here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the retarded and advanced green s functions for the wave equation and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are free fields defined by these decompositions .",
    "suppose there were no free electromagnetic fields in the distant past so that @xmath58 . using the r description above , this time asymmetric boundary condition",
    "would imply that present fields can be entirely ascribed to sources in the past .",
    "this is retardation and that is the electromagnetic arrow of time .",
    "this explanation needs to be refined for our universe because , at least if we start at decoupling , there _ is _ a significant amount of free electromagnetic radiation in the early universe constituting the cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) . indeed , at the time of decoupling the energy density in this radiation was approximately equal to that of matter .",
    "even today , approximately 13 billion years later , after being cooled and diluted by the expansion of the universe , the cmb is still the largest contributor to the electromagnetic energy density in the universe by far .",
    "the cmb s spectrum is very well fit by a black body law @xcite .",
    "that strongly suggests that the radiation is _ disordered _ with maximal entropy for its energy density .",
    "there is no evidence for the kind of correlations ( sometimes called ` conspiracies ' ) that would tend to cancel @xmath59 in the far future and give rise to advanced rather than retarded effects .",
    "the expansion of the universe has red - shifted the peak luminosity of the cmb at decoupling to microwave wavelengths today .",
    "there is thus a negligible amount energy left over from the big bang in the wavelengths we use for vision , for instance .",
    "the radiation used by realistic iguses is therefore retarded . a contemporary robot functioning at wavelengths where the cmb is absent will therefore be receiving information about charges in the past .",
    "this selection of wavelengths is plausibly not accidental but adaptive .",
    "a contemporary robot seeking to function with input from microwave wavelengths would find little emission of interest , and what there was would be overwhelmed by the all - pervasive cmb , nearly equally bright in all directions , and carrying no information .",
