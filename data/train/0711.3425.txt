    "an optical lattice is a regular periodic potential for neutral cold atoms @xcite which enables the controlled experimental exploration of paradigmatic ideas and models from condensed - matter physics .",
    "this is because cold atomic gases generally allow for a great deal of experimental tunability .",
    "for example , feshbach scattering resonances allow for the interaction strength to be experimentally varied over a considerable range @xcite .",
    "other quantities that may be altered include temperature , density , and strength and shape of the trapping potential .",
    "in particular , an optical - lattice potential plays the role of the ion - lattice potential encountered in electronic solid - state physics .",
    "the energy bands resulting from this periodic potential lead to a quenching of the kinetic energy of the atoms with respect to their interaction energy , enabling the exploration of strongly - correlated phases that play a significant role in condensed - matter physics .",
    "an important model that can be studied experimentally with cold atoms is the single - band hubbard model , which consists of interacting fermions in the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is realized by cold atoms in an optical lattice when the potential is strong enough so that only the lowest - energy band is populated @xcite . for bosonic atoms one",
    "then commonly refers to this model as the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the theoretically predicted mott - insulator - to - superfluid phase transition @xcite for this model has indeed been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the fermionic hubbard model , referred to simply as the hubbard model , is important in the context of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite and has also been realized with cold atoms @xcite . at half",
    "filling , corresponding to one particle per lattice site , the ground state of this model is antiferromagnetic , i.e. , a nel - ordered state , for strong enough on - site interactions . as the filling factor",
    "is reduced by doping , the system is conjectured to undergo a quantum phase transition to a @xmath0-wave superconducting state @xcite .",
    "a theoretical proof of the existence of @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the hubbard model is still lacking and would be a major step towards understanding the superconducting state of the cuprates . with the recent experimental advances in the field of ultracold atoms ,",
    "an experimental exploration of this issue is within reach .    in view of this motivation ,",
    "a significant problem is determining how the nel state of the hubbard model can be reached experimentally . in this paper",
    ", we study theoretically the process of adiabatically turning on the optical lattice @xcite , with the goal of determining the conditions required for an initially trapped balanced two - component fermi gas with repulsive interactions to reach the nel state in the lattice .",
    "experimentally , the presence of antiferromagnetic order in this cold - atom experiment can be subsequently detected from shot - noise correlations in the density distribution @xcite .",
    "( @xmath1 is the recoil energy ) from single - site mean - field theory ( solid curve ) and with fluctuations ( dash - dotted curve ) , where @xmath2 is the fermi temperature in the trap .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines illustrate cooling and heating into the nel state at constant entropy by starting in the harmonic trap and adiabatically turning on the lattice.,title=\"fig : \" ] * *    our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for initial temperatures lower than @xmath2 , the fermi temperature in the trap",
    ", the entropy per particle in the trap depends linearly on temperature as is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the optical lattice is then turned on adiabatically and to determine the final temperature of the gas we need the entropy per atom in the lattice . for a sufficiently smooth trapping potential such that the tunneling does not become site - dependent , the only effect of the trap",
    "is to place a restriction on the total number of particles which we discuss later and , other than this , we may neglect the trap for calculations in the lattice .",
    "since we consider balanced gases here , we will at sufficiently low temperatures first enter the mott phase with one particle per site , and the subsequent evolution of the gas is then described by the heisenberg model for the spins alone . the result from the usual mean - field theory",
    "is shown for a lattice depth of @xmath3 ( where @xmath1 is the recoil energy ) by the black curve , and is equal to @xmath4 everywhere above the critical temperature @xmath5 . since entropy is conserved in adiabatic processes ,",
    "the final temperature is simply the temperature at which the final entropy in the lattice equals the initial entropy in the trap .",
    "two such processes are shown by the dotted lines for different initial temperatures demonstrating that the gas is sometimes heated and not cooled by the lattice .",
    "nevertheless , mean - field theory leads to the intuitive result that as long as the entropy per particle in the initial state is less than @xmath6 , which is the maximum entropy of the heisenberg model , the nel state is always reached by adiabatically turning on the optical lattice .",
    "the inclusion of fluctuations leads however to a more restrictive condition . to probe the effect of fluctuations , we present an improved mean - field theory which produces a temperature - dependent entropy above @xmath5 , as seen from the inset of fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "although this approach is exact at high temperatures , it fails to account for spin waves present at low temperatures and for critical phenomena near @xmath5 . by further extending the improved mean - field theory to reproduce the correct critical and low temperature behavior due to fluctuations",
    ", we are able to determine the entropy in the lattice for all temperatures ( red curve in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we find that fluctuations lower the entropy of the atoms in the square lattice at @xmath5 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the critical exponent of the correlation length @xmath9 . for the case of three dimensions , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "as a result , the initial temperature required to reach the nel state is more than 20% lower than that found from the usual mean - field theory , but fortunately remains experimentally accessible .",
    "for example , with @xmath11k atoms and a final lattice depth of @xmath12 the nel state is achieved when the final temperature in the lattice is @xmath13 , which can be obtained with an initial temperature of @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the hubbard model is given by @xmath15 in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators , denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , where @xmath18 labels the two hyperfine spin states @xmath19 or @xmath20 of the atoms .",
    "in the first term of this expression , the sum over lattice sites labeled by indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 is over nearest neighbors only and proportional to the hopping amplitude given by @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the depth of the optical lattice potential defined by @xmath25 , %   v({\\bf x})=v_0\\sum_{\\alpha } \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{\\alpha}}{\\lambda}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the wavelength of the lattice lasers .",
    "the second term in the hamiltonian corresponds to an on - site interaction of the strength given in the harmonic approximation by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29-wave scattering length which is equal to @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that at half filling and in the limit that @xmath32 the ground state of the hubbard model is antiferromagnetic and that , for @xmath33 , its low - lying excitations are described by the effective heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath34 with @xmath35 being one half times the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the exchange constant @xmath36 arises from the superexchange mechanism .",
    "that is , the system can lower its energy by virtual nearest - neighbor hops only when there is antiferromagnetic ordering .    within the usual mean - field analysis of the effective hamiltonian in eq .",

    "in the expression for the free energy , @xmath42 is the number of nearest neighbors for a three - dimensional simple square lattice on which we focus here , @xmath43 is the thermal energy , and @xmath44 is the equilibrium value of the order parameter determined from @xmath45 it is nonzero below a critical temperature @xmath46 . after solving eq .",
    "the entropy is determined using eq .  .",
    "the results for @xmath47 and @xmath48 obtained in this way are plotted as solid black curves in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the entropy @xmath49 of the initial normal state before ramping up the optical lattice is the entropy of a trapped ideal fermi gas .",
    "it is most conveniently determined from the grand potential @xmath50~,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the chemical potential , and the effect of the harmonic trapping potential with the effectively isotropic frequency @xmath52 is incorporated via the density of states @xmath53 of the atoms .",
    "the entropy at fixed total particle number @xmath54 is then given by @xmath55 . at temperatures",
    "much lower than the fermi temperature in the trap , given by @xmath56 , we find in this manner that @xcite @xmath57 .",
    "now , by equating the final and initial entropies we calculate the temperature of the heisenberg spin system that results after adiabatically turning on the optical lattice , in terms of the initial temperature of the trapped fermi gas .    from the expression for the free energy , eq .",
    "we immediately see that @xmath58 for all temperatures @xmath59 , as was shown in fig .",
    "although this is the correct high - temperature limit of the entropy , temperature dependence will lower the entropy at @xmath5 and therefore lower the initial temperature required to achieve the nel state . to obtain the temperature dependence above @xmath5",
    ", we must thus go beyond single - site mean - field theory to include fluctuations .",
    "the simplest such model described below incorporates the interaction of a given site with one of its neighbors exactly and treats interactions with the rest of the neighbors within mean - field theory .",
    "the two - site hamiltonian for neighboring sites labeled `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' is given by @xmath60 where the last term is a correction to avoid double counting of mean - field effects .",
    "diagonalizing this hamiltonian we obtain the free energy @xmath61",

    "as in the single - site model .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we see that fluctuations lower the critical temperature and also bring about a 2% depletion of the order parameter which is now less than 0.5 near @xmath62 .     of the single ( solid curves ) and two - site ( dashed curves ) mean - field theories , the latter of which shows depletion at @xmath62 and a lowering in @xmath5 .",
    "the entropy of both theories is plotted in the inset . above @xmath5",
    "we see that the entropy of the two - site theory is temperature dependent.,title=\"fig : \" ] * *    the two - site result carries the exact @xmath63 dependence of the entropy of the heisenberg model at high temperatures . near @xmath62 , however , the entropy is still exponentially suppressed reflecting the energy cost of flipping a spin .",
    "this exponential suppression is an artefact of the mean - field approximation that ignores the goldstone modes which are present in the symmetry - broken phase .",
    "furthermore , critical behavior can not be properly accounted for by a one- , two- or higher - site model since , near the onset of nel order , critical fluctuations extend throughout the entire lattice so one would in principle need to include all sites exactly . to overcome these shortcomings ,",
    "we extend our two - site model below to all temperatures .",
    "the two - site mean - field theory produces the correct normal - state entropy behavior in the high - temperature limit , @xmath64~.\\ ] ] in the low - temperature regime , the entropy is determined from spin - wave fluctuations prevalent near @xmath62 which give a black - body - like entropy , @xmath65    the continuous interpolation between these two regimes has the additional constraint that , near @xmath5 , we should obtain the correct critical behavior of the antiferromagnet , namely , the correct universal ratio of the amplitudes above and below the phase transition @xmath66 and correct critical exponent @xmath67 where @xmath68 this follows from the fact that the singular part of the free energy density behaves as @xmath69 , where the correlation length diverges like @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "explicit expressions for the entropy embodying the correct behavior in the low- , high- and critical temperature regimes are presented in the appendix of this paper , and plotted as the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath72 using @xmath73 and @xmath10 @xcite , and the nel temperature of @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "their value at @xmath5 leads to the central result of this paper , namely , eq .",
    "( [ eq : criticals ] ) which specifies the initial entropy required to reach the nel state .",
    "as briefly mentioned earlier , there is a limit on the total number of atoms in the trap , beyond which at low temperatures it is energetically more favorable to doubly occupy sites in the center of the trap , thereby destroying the antiferromagnetic state , rather than singly occupying outlying sites where the trap potential is larger than @xmath75 .",
    "thus , insisting that the system end up in the mott - insulator state with one particle per site entails the upper bound , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mass of the atoms and @xmath26 is the wavelength of the lattice lasers .",
    "for @xmath11k atoms in a lattice with a wavelength @xmath78 nm and depth @xmath12 , and with a harmonic trap frequency @xmath79 hz , @xmath80 which is well above the typical number of atoms in experiments .",
    "we have also attempted to determine the effect that fluctuations have on the entropy in a more microscopic manner by studying gaussian fluctuations about the mean - field @xmath48 for the single - site mean - field theory in the low - temperature regime .",
    "but such a random - phase approximation has severe complications related to the fact that @xmath48 enters in the magnon dispersion as @xmath81 .",
    "hence , as can be already seen from eq .  , the contribution of the magnons to the entropy diverges when @xmath82 near @xmath5 .",
    "one way to potentially resolve this issue is to start from the hubbard hamiltonian eq .",
    "directly but such an analysis is involved @xcite and has yet to be carried out .    in the above ,",
    "we have focused on the @xmath72 case . whilst our results can easily be extended to the @xmath83 case , a more pertinent way to reach the two - dimensional antiferromagnet most relevant to high - temperature superconductors ,",
    "would be to adiabatically prepare a three - dimensional nel state , as explained in this paper , and then decrease the tunneling in one direction by changing the intensity of one of the lattice lasers . in this way ,",
    "the three - dimensional system is changed into a stack of pancakes of atoms in the two - dimensional nel state .",
    "furthermore , studying doped optical lattices made by introducing a small imbalance in the initial state may shed some light on the physics of high - temperature superconductors and would be an exciting direction for future research .",
