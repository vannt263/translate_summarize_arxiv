    "the improvement in micro - fabrication has increased greatly the experimental studies of the josephson - junction arrays of weakly coupled superconducting islands.@xcite phase transitions in these arrays are similar to those in two dimensional @xmath0 spin systems and the application of a magnetic field introduces additional frustration effects .",
    "this explains partly the revival of interest in studying @xmath5 frustrated @xmath0 spin systems .",
    "the theoretical problem is connected to the presence of two symmetries and their coupling .",
    "indeed the continuous @xmath0 symmetry leads to a kosterlitz - thouless transition driven by the unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs , while the frustration introduce an additional ising symmetry . also for helium-3 film an ising symmetry due to the p - wave order parameter exists besides the continuous symmetry of a phase like for helium-4 films.@xcite contrary to the three dimensional case",
    ", the critical region in films could be accessible to experimental observations .",
    "the model we are going to analyze has also a link to the physics of early universe,@xcite where more complicated couplings between symmetries are considered ,    extensive research has been done on two dimensional frustrated spin systems like the fully frustrated @xmath0 model @xcite or related zig - zag models,@xcite the triangular model we are discussing,@xcite the @xmath6 model,@xcite the @xmath0-ising model @xcite and the villain model.@xcite also other systems have the same symmetries : the 19 vertex model,@xcite the @xmath7 quantum spins,@xcite the coulomb gas representation,@xcite the @xmath8 model.@xcite or the rsos model@xcite therefore it is of great interest to compare the results for these different models in order to find out whether a universal critical behavior exists .",
    "a priori only two possibilities exist for the critical behavior .",
    "first , if the two phase transitions connected to the two symmetries are at the same temperature , then a new universal behavior should result .",
    "secondly if the transitions are at two different temperatures one could expect that the transitions are of the standard ising and kosterlitz - thouless type , especially if the transition temperatures are further apart .",
    "the presence of topological defects or vortices could change the reasoning . indeed",
    "numerous studies show transitions at different critical temperatures , however with exponents for the ising transition which vary from model to model and therefore can not belong to the standard nor to one universality class",
    ". the reason could be the existence of a line of fixed points generating the various exponents found in numerical works.@xcite a second proposition assumes only one new fixed point with the variation of critical exponents due to improper finite sizes corrections.@xcite thirdly olson suggested that a large screening length around the critical temperature of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition prevents to see the true standard ising behavior.@xcite    in this article we will show that several studies which indicate a non - universality of the exponents are due to finite size corrections .",
    "we are therefore led to favor the existence of only one fixed point .",
    "moreover to reconcile the result of studies done in the finite size scaling region very close to the critical temperature with those done at slightly higher temperatures we will discuss introduce the concept of an `` quasi universality class '' and give a physical interpretation as function of the size of vortex .    the behavior of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition have been less studied numerically .",
    "especially the critical temperature is difficult to find even for simpler ferromagnet @xmath0 system .",
    "we propose a new way using the binder parameter to overcome this difficulty and we obtain a critical temperature 0.002 below the ising transition .",
    "we obtain a helicity jump smaller than the jump of the ferromagnetic system and an exponent @xmath3 that is larger than @xmath9 for the ferromagnet , contrary to the theoretical predictions.@xcite    also for the kt transition there is a discrepancy between simulations at or near the critical temperature and at high temperatures . indeed in this last region",
    "the exponent @xmath10 .",
    "we introduce a `` quasi universality class '' to explain this crossover .    a combination of the metropolis algorithm and over - relaxation algorithm reduce the cpu time by an order of magnitude than the metropolis alone . with longer simulations , up to 10 times compared to previous studies ,",
    "we gain two order better statistics .    for the determination of critical exponents we have used the finite size scaling method .",
    "however , since the possible presence of a screening length could prevent to see the `` true '' behavior,@xcite we have also utilized the properties of the system in the short time critical dynamic @xcite which allows us to verify our results .",

    "indeed we have shown in this work and in @xcite that the corrections lower the result for @xmath35 ( from 0.90 to 0.80 ) and therefore that our system is not in the crossover to the ferromagnetic ising behavior @xmath161 .",
    "we then conclude that a new `` stable '' fixed point exists for a range of size @xmath59 .",
    "we call this new fixed point an `` quasi fixed point '' by similarity with the 3d case where an `` almost second order '' exists for a certain range of size @xmath59 before showing the `` true '' first order transition.@xcite this can be understood if we admit that the kosterlitz - thouless transition coupled the spins at large distance by the intermediate of @xmath179",
    ". therefore it has tendency to bring the critical behavior of the ising symmetry to the mean - field solution ( @xmath180 ) exact for infinite interactions .",
    "since @xmath179 is finite above the critical temperature the thermodynamic limit of this `` quasi fixed point '' is not stable .    to be exhaustive",
    "we mention the study of the transition @xmath0-potts(@xmath181).@xcite we have shown that the transition is of first order whenever @xmath182 . in this case",
    "the transition will stay of first order even in the thermodynamic limit , since the correlation length is finite .",
    "therefore the new fixed point ( or his absence ) is stable .",
    "this fact is rather against the interpretation of olson but it is possible that the stability of the new fixed point changes between @xmath183 ( ising ) and @xmath184 . on the contrary",
    "it would say that for the @xmath0-ising model , the two behaviors in the finite size scaling region ( @xmath185 ) and far away of the critical temperature ( @xmath161 ) are different and stable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we will present in this section our results for the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition@xcite associated to the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "this transition is characterized by the unbounding of the vortex - antivortex pair at the critical temperature . at low temperature",
    "there are only some pairs of vortex - antivortex while at high temperature alone vortex ( or antivortex ) can exist .",
    "this picture is considered as correct in the ferromagnetic and frustrated case .",
    "however the two cases could show some differences for the jump of the helicity at the critical temperature @xmath186 and for the exponent @xmath187 .",
    "the helicity @xmath40 is the answer of the system to a twist in one direction .",
    "it has been shown that at @xmath186 this quantity jump from 0 to an universal quantity@xcite for all ferromagnetic systems . moreover",
    "the behavior of @xmath40 as function of the lattice size has been predicted.@xcite the use of @xmath40 has been proved to be very useful for the ferromagnetic case and in particular to determine the critical temperature.@xcite the situation is not so clear for frustrated systems .",
    "it has been suggested that the jump at @xmath186 could be `` non universal '' i.e. different from the ferromagnetic case@xcite and no scaling with the system size has been proved .",
    "therefore rather than using the helicity to obtain informations on the transition , we will use a new method for the kt transition that we have introduced in.@xcite it consists in using binder s cumulant to study this transition .",
    "it was proved in these articles that , contrary to the common belief , the binder cumulant for ferromagnetic @xmath0 systems crosses for different sizes , allowing thus an estimate of the critical temperature and moreover an estimate of the exponent @xmath187 without the precise knowledge of the critical temperature .",
    "the ferromagnetic @xmath187 has been proved equal to @xmath188 @xcite with logarithm corrections@xcite while it has been predicted to be smaller in frustrated cases.@xcite    in this section we will first present our results for the equilibrium properties and second verify them using the short time dynamical properties .",
    "we proceed in a similar way as for the ising order parameter , replacing @xmath25 by @xmath22 .",
    "we record the variation of @xmath190 ( [ formuleum ] ) with the temperature for various system sizes in fig .",
    "[ figcm.kt ] .",
    "we want to underline the differences between our result in the frustrated case and in the ferromagnetic case : the crossing region is one order of magnitude less than for the standard @xmath0 model ( compare with fig .  1 of ref .",
    "we then locate the intersection of these curves and plot the results in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ figtc2.all ] .",
    "let us first consider a power law behavior at @xmath191 for this system .",
    "we then have to consider a linear fit for ( ln@xmath58)@xmath192 .",
    "we observe corrections for the smallest sizes @xmath1912 , 18 and 24 but the others seem to converge to the temperature @xmath193 we note from the figure that it is an upper bound for the critical temperature , i.e. it can not reach @xmath194 and therefore we obtain two transitions .    secondly we consider the behavior to be exponential as in the standard @xmath0 model . in this case fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that a linear fit could be wrong and that a `` crossover '' to a different critical temperature could be observed for bigger @xmath58 , i.e. greater sizes .",
    "however contrary to the ferromagnetic @xmath0 model , the region of crossing is very small and the different linear fits tend only to one critical temperature .",
    "we observe the same behavior for the @xmath6 model.@xcite we conclude that the linear fit works well enough and we will show below strong arguments in favor of the temperature ( [ eqn.tc.m ] ) .",
    "with the help of the critical temperature we have found an estimate of @xmath190 at @xmath186 fitting the value with a law @xmath195 : @xmath196    the exponent @xmath187 is obtained by a log - log fit of @xmath197 as function of @xmath59 shown in fig .",

    "we show our results for three values of @xmath189 , 0.34 , 0.375 , 0.41 .",
    "obviously the second value is the best and obtain : @xmath207 which is compatible with ( [ formule.eta.m ] ) .    in fig .",

    "we now want to demonstrate that the two transitions can not appear at the same temperature .",

    "[ figtc2.all ] that @xmath194 is a lower bound for the critical temperature while @xmath209 is a upper bound .",

    "the authors have shown that with varying a parameter ( @xmath214 ) it is possible to decouple the two symmetries with the ising transition appearing at lower temperature than the kt transition . however in this case the ising transition is due to the contraction to 0 ( or @xmath215 ) of the turn angle between the spins and not to the mixed of different chirality signs.@xcite therefore two physical properties exist near @xmath216 which lead to a complicated phase diagram with a cross of the critical lines .",
    "we present know our results for the helicity @xmath40 ( [ eqn.heli ] ) . in fig .",

    "moreover the exponent @xmath189 is in good agreement with those found in equilibrium properties .",
    "since the two calculations ( in the ht and fss regions ) seem correct we suggest an hypothesis similar to those given for the ising symmetry , i.e. different behavior in the fss and ht regions .",
    "we give hereafter a physical interpretation of this behavior . at high temperature",
    "the radius of the vortex are very small and they are slightly connected together while the correlation length for the ising symmetry is bigger than the radius of the vortex .",
    "the situation is different in the ffs region . in this case",
    "the radius of the vortex are large enough and the properties should depend on the domain walls due to the ising symmetry with the ising correlation length @xmath235 smaller or of the same size as the radius of the vortex .",
    "this argument is exactly the opposite of those given to explain the difference of behavior for the ising transition : the `` true '' ferromagnetic ising behavior appears only when @xmath235 is much larger than a screening length @xmath236 , i.e. the @xmath179 .",
    "this difference of argumentation reflects the differences between the two symmetries : the kosterlitz - thouless transition is a transition driven by topological defects ( vortex - antivortex ) , i.e. by `` local '' behavior , contrary to the ising transition .",
    "we call our picture `` quasi universality class '' in a similar way as the ising symmetry .",
    "the two interpretations diverge in the sense that in the thermodynamic limit ( infinite size ) the new universality class for the ising symmetry could be not stable ( however see ref .",
    "@xcite ) while it is for the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "however the two behaviors are unstable in the high temperature region , i.e. sufficiently far away from the transitions .",
    "this article is devoted to the study of the triangular frustrated @xmath0 spin system in two dimensions by extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "this system is characterized by two symmetries : a @xmath1 symmetry due to the continuous nature of the @xmath0 spins and an ising symmetry due to the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "our study is restricted to the region where the system sizes that we simulate are smaller than the values of the correlation lengths of the @xmath1 symmetry like those the ising symmetry should have in an infinite system .",
    "we have shown that the kosterlitz - thouless transition connected to the @xmath1 symmetry appears at lower temperature than the ising symmetry .",
    "our very large statistics ( two order larger than previous studies ) allow us to take into account the corrections to the scaling laws . with the knowledge of corrections",
    "we have shown that the ising transition belongs to a new universality class , i.e. the renormalization group flow tends toward a new `` stable '' fixed point .",
    "these corrections explain also the lack of universality found by several authors . knowing that the transition has a different behavior in the high temperature phase we have introduced the idea of an `` quasi fixed point '' or `` quasi universality class '' . in this interpretation this new fixed point could be unstable in the thermodynamic limit but the true behavior can not be reached in our limited accessible sizes in numerical simulations . accepting this interpretation ,",
    "the situation is similar to those who appear in frustrated systems in three dimensions.@xcite we note that our interpretation goes further than the interpretation of olson@xcite who predicts just an impossibility to obtain the true ising behavior in the finite size scaling region .",
    "we have also studied the kosterlitz - thouless transition associated to the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we have shown that this transition belongs to a new universality class characterized by an universal exponent @xmath237 and a helicity jump smaller than those in the ferromagnetic case in disagreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "we have introduced the concept of an `` quasi universality class '' for this transition to explain the different behaviors observed between the finite size scaling and the high temperature regions . in this interpretation",
    "the new behavior is stable in the thermodynamic limit near the critical temperature but not when the temperature is much larger than the critical temperature .",
    "we have given a physical interpretation of this new concept .",
    "to bring new informations and verify our predictions for these systems we have three possible ways .",
    "the first way is to improve the theoretical approaches of these systems .",
    "in particular it should be extremely interesting to have a theoretical result for exponents of the new fixed point for the ising symmetry .",
    "however since it is difficult to describe the coupling between the two symmetries , the precise calculation of exponents seems , for the moment , an impossible task .",
    "another possibility is the experimental approach in the josephson - junction array@xcite or in films of @xmath238he.@xcite however one of the problems of experiments is to have access to the interesting quantities .",
    "for example it is usually difficult to measure the chirality in these systems because it is not related directly to measurable quantities .",
    "the easiest way to obtain reliable information seem to be numerical simulations .",
    "indeed the use of powerful computers and fast algorithms allows to obtain precise results out of reach some years ago .",
    "we have to study different models to observe the universality class in the finite size scaling region but also in the high temperature region to verify the picture predicted in this work .",
