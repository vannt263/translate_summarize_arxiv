    "populations evolve when different individuals have different traits or strategies that determine their reproductive success . in population genetic models ,",
    "this success is typically constant , whereas in evolutionary game theory the fitness of an individual depends on interactions with other members of the population . consequently , fitness depends on the relative proportions ( or frequencies ) of different strategic types and hence gives rise to so called frequency dependent selection .",
    "more successful strategies increase in abundance and may either take over the entire population or , as the strategy becomes increasingly common , may suffer from a decrease in fitness , which can result in the co - existence of two or more traits within the population .",
    "for example , in host - parasite coevolution , a rare parasite may be most successful , but once it reaches high abundance , selection pressure on the host increases and the host is likely to develop some defense mechanism . consequently , the success of the parasite decreases .",
    "such dynamics can be conveniently described by evolutionary game theory @xcite .    traditionally , the mathematical description of evolutionary game dynamics is formulated in terms of the deterministic replicator equation @xcite .",
    "this implies that population sizes are infinite and populations are unstructured .",
    "only more recently the stochastic dynamics in finite populations attracted increasing attention @xcite .",
    "typically , the stochastic approach becomes deterministic in the limit of infinite populations . for large , but finite populations the dynamics",
    "can be approximated by stochastic differential equations ( sde ) @xcite .",
    "this analytic approach is a natural extension of the replicator dynamics , which is capable of bridging the gap between deterministic models and individual based simulations .",
    "moreover , sde s are typically computationally far less expensive than simulations because the execution time does not scale with population size .",
    "in unstructured , finite populations of constant size , @xmath3 , consisting of @xmath4 distinct strategic types and with a mutation rate , @xmath0 , evolutionary changes can be described by the following class of birth - death processes : in each time step , one individual of type @xmath5 produces a single offspring and displaces another randomly selected individual of type @xmath6 .",
    "with probability @xmath7 , no mutation occurs and @xmath5 produces an offspring of the same type . but with probability @xmath0 , the offspring of an individual of type @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) mutates into a type @xmath5 individual .",
    "this results in two distinct ways to increase the number of @xmath5 types by one at the expense of decreasing the number of @xmath6 types by one , hence keeping the population size constant .",
    "biologically , keeping @xmath3 constant implies that the population has reached a stable ecological equilibrium and assumes that this equilibrium remains unaffected by trait frequencies .",
    "the probability for the event of replacing a type @xmath6 individual with a type @xmath5 individual is denoted by @xmath10 and is a function of the state of the population @xmath11 , with @xmath12 indicating the number of individuals of type @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .    for this process",

    "are picked at random and a payoff comparison determines whether the focal individual switches its strategy .",

    "it is important to mention that for small mutation rates serious mathematical intricacies arise in the vicinity of absorbing boundaries and saddle - node fixed points @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the reason for these complications arises from the diffusion approximation that underlies the derivation of the fokker - planck equation  ( [ eq : fpe ] ) . in systems with such absorbing boundaries ( or sub - spaces where one or more strategic types are absent )",
    "finite populations spend non - negligible time on these boundaries in the limit @xmath142 .",

    "interestingly , this failure of the continuum approximation has not been raised in population genetics , where similar considerations have been made , but typically the description is only made on the level of the fokker - planck equation and not based on stochastic differential equations @xcite . however , population geneticists are typically interested in simpler scenarios , where each type has a fixed fitness . in this case , the corresponding deterministic system has no generic trajectories that are close to absorbing boundaries .",
    "moreover , the usual diffusion approximation in population genetics , where the selection intensity scales to zero while the population size diverges , leads to substantial noise , such that these effects have a minor impact .    for evolutionary games with small mutation rates",
    "one is typically not forced to apply this relatively complex approximation .",
