    "in contrast to the kdv equation , this difference in the initial conditions produces qualitatively different solutions .",
    "this difference arises because the kdv and ckdv equations contain at least one hyperelliptic branch point , while all of the fixed points are double points for the two - kink solutions .",

    "this interesting phenomenon occurs when two separate solitons enter an interaction but only one single soliton emerges from this interaction . since all of the equations under study are invariant under the space - time inversion @xmath194 , the reverse process of soliton fission may also occur where a single soliton breaks into two distinct solitons at some critical time .",

    ". since they have an identical form as that in ( [ burgerlike ] ) , all the analysis from the last section applies and we conclude that both @xmath149 and @xmath150 are kinks which experience fission or fusion respectively . we find that as @xmath232 , @xmath149 is an antikink and @xmath150 decomposes into two kinks .",
    "this implies that @xmath233 consists of two kinks and one antikink .",
    "as @xmath178 , @xmath149 fissions into two antikinks and the 2 kinks comprising @xmath150 fuse into one kink .",

    "this is because the kappa appears under the square root in ( [ mx ] ) so that real values of @xmath1 for @xmath236 correspond exactly to imaginary values of @xmath1 when @xmath35 and vice versa .",
    "another important difference is that no kink solutions exist for the shg equations . when @xmath35 there is no way to deform the riemann surface so that all points coalesce piecewise as required for kink solitons .",
    "therefore there are always at least two hyperelliptic points left .",
    "this means that shg solutions do not have a possibility of either fusing or fissioning and no change of form can occur .",

    "it is remarkable that the formulas are so similar to those of the coupled kdv equation since they are not in the same hierarchy of equations - the two equations are derived from two different potentials .",
    "the phase shift formulas show another strength of the algebraic geometric method since the details of the inverse scattering transform have not been completed at this time , see khusnutdinova(1998 ) . @xmath52 and @xmath53 are plotted in figure  [ fig : shg ] .",
