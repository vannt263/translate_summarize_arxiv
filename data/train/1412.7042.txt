    "the study of interaction between electromagnetic fields and graphene has seen a riveting development in recent years . in particular ,",
    "efforts have centered on oscillation - energies near the experimentally achievable fermi level of graphene , typically in the sub - ev range , where the principal features are due to the excitation of either propagating or localized two - dimensional plasmons@xcite .",
    "a large variety of structural configurations has been investigated , ranging from e.g. , finite structures@xcite to periodic arrays@xcite . of these studies ,",
    "the overwhelming majority exhibit the common assumption of structural planarity .",
    "recently , interest has emerged also in exploring the properties of plasmonic - interaction in curved configurations , e.g. , propagating modes in bent and corrugated sheets@xcite , in the context of cloaking@xcite , and in various coated nanowire systems@xcite .    .",
    "here depicted for a @xmath0 fullerene , for illustrative purposes solely . ]    in this paper , we examine the archetypal curved graphene structure : a sphere , highly amenable to analytics and exhibiting the key features necessary to gain clear physical insight in the role of curvature .",
    "the spherical geometry is also of experimental relevance , given recent fabricational demonstrations .",
    "notably , demonstrations include reduced graphene - oxide hollow spheres@xcite , graphene - encapsulation of hollow sno@xmath1 spheres of radii down to @xmath2@xcite , and porous multilayer graphene nanospheres supported by a polystyrene interior@xcite . though the graphene in these recent demonstrations exhibits several deviations from an idealized two - dimensional spherical coating",
    ", they underscore the relevance of the geometry beyond a theoretical perspective . at the opposite end of the size - spectrum ,",
    "the fullerenes represent a tempting analogy .",
    "however , it is now well - established that larger fullerenes , such as c@xmath3 and beyond , prefer faceted , predominately icosahedral rather than spherical configurations@xcite .",
    "additionally , the use of semiclassical , local response functions in graphene is reasonable only for structures in excess of @xmath4 carbon atoms@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we take a classical , local surface conductivity approach , and as such we expect our predictions to be reliable chiefly for radii larger than @xmath5 ( a graphene - sphere of @xmath6 atoms has a radius of @xmath7 ) , significantly beyond the range of fullerenes .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : for graphene described by a local surface conductivity , we show in section  [ sec : vectorwaves ] that its electromagnetic response can be understood through a modified mie  lorenz theory . from the asymptotic limit of these results to the quasistatic realm , we derive the multipolar polarizability in section  [ sec : nonretarded ] , and identify the multipole plasmon conditions in the quasistatic regime , which are particularly transparent .",
    "specifically , we show that an intuitive , effective - momentum mapping connects the sphere - resonances with those of an infinite plane . in section  [ sec : dielectric ] we present calculations for graphene - coated dielectric spheres , considering first the size - dispersion of the multipole resonances .",
    "next , comparing two observables , the extinction cross - section and the local density of states ( ldos ) , we highlight the physical significance of the dipole and higher - order multipoles . in section  [ sec : drude ] we study the interaction between a localized plasmon supported by a drude sphere , e.g. , a doped semiconductor , and the plasmon supported by the graphene coating .",
    "we close our treatment of coated drude spheres by discussing a corollary of the formalism related to surficial damping in metal plasmonics .",

    "this broad feature is comprised of several spectrally overlapping multipole plasmons , that are increasingly congested as the energies approach @xmath126 . once more , this effect has a close analogue in metallic nanospheres where local response incurs a pile up of multipole modes near the flat - interface surface plasmon resonance at @xmath127 , with @xmath128 denoting the metallic plasma frequency.@xcite",

    "the drude dispersion is traditionally applied to metals , but also reliably describes strongly doped semiconductors much larger in extent than the fermi wavelength.@xcite the case of doped semiconductor spheres is significantly more interesting from the perspective of mode hybridization , as the range of plasma frequencies of doped semiconductors overlap the realizable fermi energies of graphene .    in this case where the interior is dispersive and well - described by eq .",

    "<S> we present an analytical derivation of the electromagnetic response of a spherical object coated by a conductive film , here exemplified by a graphene coating . applying the framework of mie  lorenz theory augmented to account for a conductive boundary condition , we derive the multipole scattering coefficients , modified essentially through the inclusion of an additive correction in numerator and denominator . by reductionist means , starting from the retarded response , we offer simple results in the quasistatic regime by analyzing the multipolar polarizability and associated dispersion equation for the localized plasmons . </S>",
    "<S> we consider graphene coatings of both dielectric and conducting spheres , where in the former case the graphene coating introduces the plasmons and in the latter case modifies in interesting ways the existing ones . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss our analytical results in the context of extinction cross - section and local density of states . </S>",
    "<S> recent demonstrations of fabricated spherical graphene nanostructures make our study directly relevant to experiments . </S>"
