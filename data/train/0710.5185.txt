    "we study an epidemic model describing the course of a single disease within a spatially structured human population distributed in _",
    "social clusters _ of _ finite or infinite size_. that is , each site of the @xmath0-dimensional integer lattice @xmath1 is occupied by a cluster of _ individuals _ , each individual can be _ healthy _ or _ infected _ and the number of infected individuals at each cluster is either bounded or may be infinite . a cluster is said to be infected if it contains at least one infected individual and is said to be healthy otherwise .",
    "the first model we investigate is an extension of a process introduced in schinazi ( 2002 ) , and will be referred to as the _ cluster recovery process _ ( crp ) .",
    "the second with another recovery mechanism extend a process introduced in belhadji and lanchier ( 2006 ) , and will be referred to as the _ individual recovery process _ ( irp ) .    for both crp ( schinazi , 2002 ) and irp ( belhadji and lanchier , 2006 ) , the dynamics depends on three parameters , namely the outside infection rate @xmath2 ( the rate at which an individual infects healthy individuals of other clusters ) , the within infection rate @xmath3 ( the rate at which an individual infects healthy individuals present in the same cluster ) , and the cluster size @xmath4 ( can be seen as the mean number of individuals having sustained contacts with a given individual ) . in both models , it is assumed that , once a cluster has at least one infected individual , infections within the cluster are a lot more likely than additional infections from the outside so we neglect the latter .",
    "the only difference between the crp and the irp is the recovery mechanism . for the crp ,",
    "all the infected individuals in a given cluster are simultaneously replaced by healthy individuals , which follows from the assumption that , once an infected individual is discovered , its social cluster rapidly recovers thanks to an antidote . for the irp",
    ", we deal with the other extreme case , that is we assume that at most one infected individual recovers at once , that is the tracking system is not effective enough and the infection can spread within a given cluster before it is detected . in particular , the crp and the irp can be considered as spatial stochastic models for the transmission of infectious diseases in developed and developing countries , respectively .",
    "we assume that individuals within the same cluster have repeated contacts whereas the individuals belonging to neighboring clusters have casual contacts only .",
    "this suggests that the infection spreads out faster within clusters than between them , this is the reason why we introduce in the irp and crp an other outside infection rate @xmath5 ( at which an individual infects healthy individuals of other infected clusters ) .",
    "this allows us to take @xmath5 lower than @xmath3 , to favorate within infections .",
    "more general than the processes of schinazi ( 2002 ) and belhadji and lanchier , we will assume that an outside infection may occur even if the cluster is already infected , and to avoid the condition that the number of infected individuals is bounded by @xmath4 we will deal with irp and crp with infinite cluster size .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to investigate the probability of an epidemic for both processes depending on the value of each of the three parameters @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 .    in both the cluster recovery process ( schinazi , 2002 ) and individual recovery process ( belhadji and lanchier , 2006 ) ,",
    "only the population of infected individuals is taken into account ; we will consider more general markov processes evolving on the 1-dimensional lattice , without any restrictions on the clusters sizes , and with two types of particles , healthy and infected individuals .    in this model healthy individuals",
    "get infected with the same infection mechanism as in crp , infected individuals recover at rate @xmath6 and moreover individuals are born , die and migrate , the migration of individuals ( infected or healthy ) speeded up by renormalizing parameter @xmath7 . by using the relative entropy method , and in particular the works mourragui ( 1996 ) ,",
    "perrut ( 2000 ) , we will prove that the process admits hydrodynamic limits , that is by rescaling space and time the densities of healthy and infected individuals evolve according to nonlinear reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "in order to investigate the individual and cluster recoveries processes with infinite cluster size , we start by introducing the evolution of the individual and cluster recoveries processes with finite cluster size @xmath8 denoted respectively by irp(@xmath4 ) and crp(@xmath4 ) .",
    "the irp@xmath9 is a continuous - time markov process in which the state at time @xmath10 is a function @xmath11 , with @xmath4 denoting the common size of the clusters , and @xmath12 indicates the number of infected individuals present in the cluster at time @xmath13 . to take into account the outside infections , we introduce an interaction neighborhood . for any @xmath14 , @xmath15",

    "in other respects , if there are @xmath22 infected individuals in the cluster @xmath14 , @xmath23 , then the state of @xmath14 flips from @xmath22 to @xmath24 at rate @xmath5 times the number of infected individuals present in the neighboring clusters plus @xmath25 ( each of infected individual infects healthy ones in the cluster @xmath14 at rate @xmath3 ) . finally , each infected individual recovers at rate 1 regardless of the number of infected individuals in its cluster .",

    "we rely on techniques introduced in chen ( 1992 ) to prove the existence and uniqueness of the irp(@xmath57 ) and the crp(@xmath57 ) when @xmath62 .",
    "we now discuss the effects of each of the three parameters , namely the outside infection rates @xmath2 and @xmath5 , and the within infection rate @xmath3 , on the probability of an epidemic for both models .    from now on ,",

    "note that , when @xmath64 and @xmath65 , there can be only one infected individual in each cluster so that both processes irp(@xmath57 ) and crp(@xmath57 ) are identical and reduce to the basic contact process with infection rate @xmath2 , in this case , there exists a critical value @xmath66 such that if @xmath67 then the processes converge in distribution to the `` all 0 '' configuration ; otherwise , an epidemic may occur .",
    "it follows by using basic coupling that an epidemic may occur whenever @xmath68 regardless of the value of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath5 and through a comparison with a branching random walk , we deduce that the processes irp(@xmath57 ) and crp(@xmath57 ) converge to the `` all 0 '' configuration when @xmath69 . when @xmath5 or @xmath3 are different from 0 , the limiting behavior of the process is more complicated to predict due to the combined effects of the three birth rates .",
