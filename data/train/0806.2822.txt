    "an impressive amount of different astrophysical data are suggesting that the observed universe can be represented by an accelerating spatially flat cosmology driven by an exotic component sometimes called dark energy @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cosmological constant , the most interesting candidates for describing this dark energy component are : a vacuum decaying energy density , or a time varying @xmath2 @xcite , the so - called  x - matter \" @xcite , a relic scalar field rolling down its potential @xcite , and a chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "some recent review articles discussing the history , interpretations , as well as the major difficulties of such candidates have also been published in the last few years @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "some studies have pointed out that the age of old high redshift objects ( at moderate and high redshifts ) is a powerful physical constraint to cosmological models @xcite .",
    "for old high redshift galaxies ( ohrgs ) , for instance , their ages can be inferred by measuring the magnitude in different bands and then using stellar evolutionary codes to choose the model that reproduces the observed colors @xcite . in principle , for old high redshift objects , the derived ages can put tight constraints on the physical parameters or even rule out many kinds of dark energy models .    in this article , we discuss some observational constraints on two different classes of chaplygin type accelerating cosmologies coming from the existence of the apm 08279 + 5255 , an old quasar at high redshift located at @xmath0 which has an estimated age of 2 - 3 gyr @xcite . as reported by many authors",
    "@xcite , the existence of this object is not compatible with many dark energy models unless the present accepted values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 be further revised .",
    "we also derive new constraints on the hubble constant @xmath1 , by using a joint analysis involving different ohrgs samples and the current sdss measurements of the baryon acoustic peak @xcite .",
    "the bao signature comes out because the cosmological perturbations excite sound waves in the relativistic plasma , thereby producing the acoustic peaks in the early universe .",
    "actually , eisenstein _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented the large scale correlation function from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) showing clear evidence for the baryon acoustic peak at @xmath5 mpc scale , which is in excellent agreement with the wmap prediction from cmb data .",
    "we stress that the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) method is independent of the hubble constant @xmath1 although being heavily dependent on the value of @xmath3 . in this way",
    ", it contributes indirectly to fix the value of @xmath1 since it breaks the degeneracy on the mass density parameter , @xmath3 @xcite . as we shall see , both set of data ( ohrgs sample and bao signature ) provide an interesting method to constrain the hubble constant .",
    "the basic idea underlying the simplified chaplygin gas concept ( from now on sc - gas ) either the quintessence @xcite or quartessence @xcite version , is to reduce the number of free parameters of the generalized c - gas @xcite , however , maintaining the physically interesting properties . in the quintessence case it behaves as a pressureless fluid ( nonrelativistic matter ) at high-@xmath6 while , at late times , it approaches the quintessence behavior .",
    "the generalized c - gas has as equation of state ( eos ) : @xmath7 which leads to the following adiabatic sound speed : @xmath8    by using the definition @xmath9 , the present c - gas adiabatic sound speed reads @xmath10 .",
    "thus , if we want to require the positiviness of @xmath11 and also want to reduce the number of free parameters of the c - gas , the simplest way of doing that is imposing @xmath12 . with this",
    "we have that @xmath13 , thus assuring a natural positiviness for @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , in order to guarantee that @xmath14 , the @xmath15 parameter it will be restricted on the interval @xmath16 ( for more details see lima , cunha and alcaniz @xcite ) . as a consequence",
    ", the simplified quintessence chaplygin gas is fully characterized only by two parameters : @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "as one may check , for a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker geometry the dimensionless hubble parameter is given by @xmath18^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}\\right]^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , this means that the@xmath15 parameter is actually the unique unknown constant related to this sc - gas model .",
    "the free parameters of such cosmologies are reduced to @xmath3 , and the present rate of expansion , @xmath1 .      in the quartessence version of the sc - gas ,",
    "the model maintain all the physical requirements of the quintessence scenario , with the additional feature of unifying dark sector ( dark matter and dark energy ) .",
    "in such a scenario , besides the sc - gas the unique nonvanishing contribution ( radiation is important only at early times ) comes from baryonic component which is tightly constrained by big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) .    in this case",
    ", it is readily seen that the dimensionaless hubble parameters is given by @xmath21^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}\\right]^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the baryon contribution , @xmath23 stands for the sc - gas as quartessence contribution .",
    "note that @xmath24 because we have assumed spatial flatness . therefore , since @xmath22 is quite well determined , one may conclude that only two parameters remain to be constrained in this unified dark matter / energy scenario , namely , @xmath15 and @xmath1",
    "let us now discuss the age - redshift test in the above discussed backgrounds . for both cases , the expression for the age relation @xmath25 takes the following form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is given by ( [ ezquint ] ) or ( [ ezq4 ] ) for the quintessence and quartessence versions , respectively .",
    "note that for @xmath28 the above expression reduces to the well known result for einstein - de sitter model ( cdm , @xmath28 ) for which @xmath29 .",
    "as one may conclude from the above equation , limits on the cosmological parameters @xmath3 ( or @xmath22 ) , @xmath15 and @xmath1 ( or equivalently @xmath30 ) , can be derived by fixing @xmath25 from observations .",
    "note also that the age parameter , @xmath31 , depends only on the product of the two quantities @xmath1 and @xmath25 , which are usually estimated from completely independent methods @xcite .",
    "the age - redshift test is given by the condition @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the age of an arbitrary object , say , a quasar or a galaxy at a given redshift @xmath6 and @xmath34 is the dimensionless factor given by the @xmath35 of eq .",
