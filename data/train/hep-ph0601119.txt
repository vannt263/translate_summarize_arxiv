    "it is common knowledge that the presence of a medium does not introduce new uv divergencies in quantum field theoretical calculations , basically because the momenta of the medium fluctuations are constrained by the temperature @xmath1 and/or the chemical potential @xmath3 . at times",
    "this fact is used to comfort a somewhat pragmatic strategy in practical calculations , namely discussing only the matter contribution to the quantity under consideration , deferring the renormalization ( of the vacuum part ) as standard ` textbook physics ' .",
    "such a procedure , however , should be applied with the appropriate care in cases where new momentum scales occur , as in the context of statistical field theory .",

    "recently , the expression ( [ eq : md pre ] ) has also been utilized as a parameterization of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) results @xcite .",
    "it there turned out that the debye mass in the non - perturbative regime near the ( phase- ) transition temperature @xmath2 can be reasonably described by a re - scaling _ ansatz _ @xmath8 , see below .",
    "a reckoned explanation of the observed enhancement , @xmath9 , is the next - to - leading order correction @xcite to the result ( [ eq : md pre ] ) which , under reasonable assumptions for the magnetic mass , is positive . as an aside",
    "it is noted that such an interpretation is quite non - trivial .",
    "naively , one could expect that if @xmath10 changes notably in a certain temperature range and the next - to - leading order correction is of a similar size as the leading term , one can not parameterize the modification by a _ constant _ factor . however , in qcd the correction is logarithmically enhanced due to an ir sensitivity of the debye mass , implying @xmath11 where @xmath12 @xcite .",
