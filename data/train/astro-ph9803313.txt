    "ultraviolet images of globular clusters are often dominated by one or two hot , luminous , `` uv - bright '' stars .",
    "the most luminous of these stars are believed to be post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars , which go through a luminous uv - bright phase as they leave the agb and move rapidly across the hr diagram toward their final white dwarf state . despite their short lifetimes ( @xmath2 yrs )",
    ", hot post - agb stars can dominate the total ultraviolet flux of an old stellar population .",
    "in particular , hot post - agb stars probably make a significant ( although not the dominant ) contribution to the uv - upturn observed in elliptical galaxies ( brown et al .",
    "however , a large uncertainty exists in modeling the contribution of hot post - agb stars to the integrated spectrum of an old stellar population , due to the strong dependence of the post - agb luminosity and lifetime on the core mass , which in turn depends on when the stars leave the agb ( charlot et al.@xcite ) .",
    "also the previous mass loss on the red giant branch ( rgb ) plays an important rle here , since it determines the fate of a star during and after the horizontal branch stage : stars with very low envelope masses settle along the extended horizontal branch ( ehb ) and evolve from there directly to the white dwarf stage , whereas stars with envelope masses of more than 0.02  will at least partly ascend the agb .",
    "a further uncertainty arises because theoretical post - agb tracks have been only minimally tested for old , low - mass stars .",
    "the last census of hot post - agb stars in globular clusters was published by de boer ( @xcite ) , but this list is certainly incomplete .",
    "the detection of hot post - agb stars in optical color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd s ) is limited by selection effects due to crowding in the cluster cores and to the large bolometric corrections for these hot stars .",
    "more complete searches are possible for hot post - agb stars in planetary nebulae , for example , by using imaging .",
    "however , only four planetary nebulae ( pne ) were discovered in a recent survey of 133 globular clusters ( jacoby et al.@xcite ) , of which two were previously known ( k648 in m  15 , and iras 18333 - 2357 in m  22 ) .",
    "jacoby et al .",
    "expected to find 16 planetary nebulae in their sample , on the basis of the planetary nebula luminosity function for metal - poor populations .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not yet understood , but we mention two possible contributing factors .",
    "first , the search of jacoby et al . may have missed some old , faint planetary nebulae .",
    "second , jacoby et al .",
    "derive the number of expected pne from the total cluster luminosity , assuming that all stars in a globular cluster will eventually go through the agb phase .",
    "but in a cluster such as ngc 6752 , about 30% of the hb population consists of ehb stars ( with @xmath0  @xmath3 20,000  k ) , which are predicted to evolve into white dwarfs without ever passing through the thermally pulsing agb phase .",
    "the exact fraction of stars which follow such evolutionary will depend on the poorly known mass loss rates during the hb and early - agb phases .    while globular clusters with a populous ehb are expected to be deficient in post - agb stars",
    ", they should show a substantial population of less luminous ( 1.8 @xmath4 @xmath5  @xmath4 3 ) uv - bright stars , which can be either post - ehb stars or post - early agb stars .",
    "the population of post - ehb stars is expected to be about 1520 % of the population of ehb stars ( dorman et al .",
    "the post - early agb population arises from hot hb stars with sufficient envelope mass to return to the agb , but which peel off the agb prior to the thermally pulsing phase ( dorman et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    during the two flights of the _ astro _ observatory in 1990 and 1995 , the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit , stecher et al .",
    "@xcite ) was used to obtain ultraviolet ( @xmath6   ) images of 14 globular clusters .",
    "the solar - blind detectors on uit suppress the cool star population , which allows uv - bright stars to be detected into the cluster cores , and the @xmath7 field of view of uit is large enough to image the entire population of most of the observed clusters .",
    "thus , the uit images provide a complete census of the hot uv - bright stars in the observed clusters .",
    "we have begun a program to obtain spectra of all the uv - bright stars found on the uit images , in order to derive effective temperatures and gravities for the complete sample , for comparison with evolutionary tracks .",
    "several of the uv - bright stars found on the uit images , such as rob 162 in ngc  6397 , barnard 29 in m  13 , and vz 1128 in m  3 , were previously known and are well - studied .",
    "other uit stars are too close to the cluster cores for ground - based spectroscopy , and will require hst observations for further study . in this paper , we report on spectroscopy of those uit uv - bright stars accessible for ground - based observations from the southern hemisphere .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "to compute the luminosities , we require the cluster distances and reddenings .",
    "these values are taken from the may 1997 tabulation of harris ( @xcite ) except that the distance and reddening toward m  4 ( d = 1.73 kpc , @xmath8  = 0.35 ) is taken from the hst study of richer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we also use the nonstandard value of 3.8 for r@xmath9 [ = a@xmath9/@xmath8 ] toward m  4 , as suggested recently by several authors ( peterson et al .",
    "@xcite ; richer et al.@xcite ) , along with the ism parameterization of cardelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "+ luminosities were determined by first using the distance and reddening to convert the v or uit magnitude to an absolute magnitude , and then applying a bolometric correction using the @xmath0  derived from the model atmosphere fit . because these hot stars have large bolometric corrections , the luminosities derived using the v magnitude are very sensitive to the value of @xmath0(@xmath11l @xmath12  @xmath0 ) .",
    "the uit magnitude has a much smaller bolometric correction , but typically has poorer photometric precision , and is more sensitive to reddening .",
    "therefore , we have computed luminosities using both methods . as can be seen from table  2",
    "both values agree rather well .",
    "the uncertainty in the derived luminosities ranges from 0.12 dex for the cooler stars , to 0.16 dex to ngc 6121-y453 , assuming uncertainties of in v , in the uit flux , in @xmath8 , 0.035 dex in @xmath0 , and 10% in the cluster distances .    knowing effective temperatures , surface gravities and absolute magnitudes we can derive the masses of the stars as described in moehler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . assuming errors of and in the observed and theoretical v magnitudes , respectively , and 0.15 dex in @xmath1  we arrive at an error for log ( m/ ) of 0.18 dex or about 50% . for a detailed discussion of error sources",
    "see moehler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the results are listed in table  2 .",
    "the derived effective temperatures and gravities of the target stars are plotted in figure 3 , along with zahb and post - hb evolutionary tracks for [ fe / h ] = @xmath131.48 from dorman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and post - agb ( 0.565  ) and post - early agb ( 0.546  ) tracks from schnberner ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stars ngc  6121-y453 , ngc  6723-iii60 , and ngc  6723-iv9 appear to fit the post - early agb track , while the remaining four targets are consistent with post - ehb evolutionary tracks . in agreement with this scenario ,",
    "the three post - early agb stars have approximately solar helium abundances , while the post - ehb stars have subsolar helium abundances .",
    "the latter stars are expected to have subsolar helium abundances because they are direct descendants of ehb stars , which are known to show helium deficiencies ( moehler et al .",
    "@xcite ) , most likely due to diffusion processes .",
    "the post - early agb stars , on the other hand , have evolved off the agb , where the convective atmosphere is expected to eliminate any previous abundance depletions caused by diffusion .",
    "curiously , no helium - rich ( he / h @xmath14 1 ) sdo stars have yet been found in a globular cluster , although such stars dominate the field sdo population ( lemke et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    as expected , the two clusters with a populous ehb ( ngc  2808 and ngc  6752 ) have post - ehb stars but no post - agb stars .",
    "the clusters ngc  6723 and m  4 , on the other hand , do not have an ehb population , although they do have stars blueward of the rr lyrae gap ( which are potential progenitors of post - early agb stars ) .",
    "the lack of true post - agb stars may be understood from the different lifetimes : the lifetime of schnberner s post - early agb track is about 10 times longer than his lowest mass post - agb track .",
    "thus , even if only a small fraction of stars follow post - early agb tracks , those stars may be more numerous than true post - agb stars . due to their relatively long lifetime , post - early agb stars",
    "are unlikely to be observed as central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspne ) since any nebulosity is probably dispersed before the central star is hot enough to ionize it",
    ". additional detail on the individual stars is given below :      all three stars in ngc  2808 analysed in this paper are likely post - ehb stars .",
    "( unfortunately , the best post - agb candidate stars on the uit image of ngc  2808 are too close to the cluster center to allow spectroscopy from the ground . )",
    "although c2946 and c2947 could be separated in the long - slit optical spectra , they are too close together to estimate individual uv fluxes from the uit image , and thus there is no uv luminosity determination in table 2 . due to the well - populated ehb of ngc  2808 ( sosin et al . , @xcite ) ,",
    "a large number of post - ehb stars are expected .    from their three - colour wfpc2 photometry of ngc 2808 , sosin et al.(@xcite ) find a larger distance modulus [ ( m - m)@xmath15 = 15.25  15.40 ] and lower reddening [ @xmath8  = 0.09  0.16 ] than the values adopted here from harris ( @xcite ) .",
    "the use of the distance and reddening of sosin et al.would yield masses about 20% larger , and luminosities about 0.05 dex larger than the values given in table 2 .",
    "y453 is possibly the hottest globular cluster star known so far .",
    "other candidates are three central stars of planetary nebulae ( iras 18333 - 2357 in m  22 , harrington & paltoglou @xcite ; jafu1 in pal  6 and jafu2 in ngc  6441 , jacoby et al . , @xcite ) , which however lack model atmosphere analyses of their stellar spectra .",
    "such a high @xmath0  is not unexpected , since according to the schnberner tracks , a post - agb star will spend most of its lifetime at temperatures greater than 30,000  k. however , as pointed out by renzini ( @xcite ) , the large bolometric corrections of such hot stars in the visible have biased the discovery of post - agb stars in favour of cooler stars .    in the @xmath16@xmath1  plot , y453 fits well on the 0.546  post - early agb track of schnberner ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , our derived luminosity ( @xmath5  = 2.6 ) is considerably lower than the schnberner track at that @xmath0  and @xmath1 , and the derived mass of 0.16  is astrophysically implausible . in order to obtain a mass of 0.55",
    ", the value of @xmath1  would need to be 5.68 instead of 5.15 .",
    "this difference is too large to be accommodated by the spectral fitting , and still would not explain the discrepancy with the theoretically expected luminosity . therefore , below we consider some other possible sources of error :    line blanketing : : :    the use of fully line - blanketed nlte models for the analysis of y453    might result in a somewhat lower temperature ( 0.05 dex ) without any    changes in surface gravity ( lanz et al",
    "@xcite ; haas @xcite ) .",
    "such a    lower temperature would increase the derived mass by about 15% .",
    "differential reddening : : :    cudworth & rees ( @xcite ) find a gradient in the reddening that would    increase the adopted reddening for y453 ( ) by about .",
    "lyons et al .",
    "( @xcite ) report a patchiness in the reddening toward m  4 that is at    least as significant as the gradient , and find a total range of 0.16    mag in @xmath8 .",
    "an increase by such a large    amount would still lead to a mass of only 0.3  . due to the    non - standard reddening law toward m  4 ,",
    "the reddening correction for    y453 has a rather high uncertainty in any case .",
    "distance : : :    the adopted distance ( 1.72 kpc ) to m  4 is on the low side of the range    of distance determinations but is supported by both a recent    astrometric measurement ( rees @xcite ) , and hst observations of the    main - sequence ( richer et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "use of the distance given by    harris ( @xcite ; 2200 pc ) would give a mass of 0.26  .",
    "photometry : : :    the only ground - based photometry of y453 of which we are aware is the    photographic photometry of cudworth & rees ( @xcite ) , who also derive    a 99% probability of cluster membership from its proper motion .",
    "y453    is among the faintest stars studied by cudworth & rees , so the    photometric precision might be poorer than their quoted 0.025 mag    ( which corresponds to an error of 2% in m ) .",
    "the v and b@xmath13v magnitudes in table 1 for iii-60 are from menzies ( @xcite ) ; we are not aware of any other photometry of this star .",
    "the tabulated photometry for iv-9 is from l.k .",
    "fullton ( 1997 , priv . comm . ) , who also gives u ",
    "b @xmath17 .",
    "photometry for iv-9 was also obtained by menzies ( @xcite ; v = 14.86 , b@xmath13v @xmath18 ) , and martins & fraquelli ( @xcite ; v=14.69 , b@xmath13v @xmath19 ) . iii-60 and iv-9 fit well on the 0.546  post - early agb track ( see above ) of schnberner , and",
    "also have luminosities ( @xmath5@xmath20 ) consistent with being post - early agb stars .",
    "the spectrum of iv-9 , however , was difficult to fit with any single model . as can be seen from fig . 1",
    "there is an absorption feature blueward of the line at 4713   , which matches the absorption line at 4686    in wavelength .",
    "the line strength and the balmer line profiles can be reproduced by a model with @xmath0  = 30,000  k , @xmath1  = 4.08 , and @xmath21  = @xmath130.89 . however ,",
    "this model is inconsistent with both the size of the balmer jump and with the photometric indices ( optical and uv ) of this star .",
    "the photometric data indicate a temperature of 20000  21000  k instead . excluding the absorption feature at 4686    from the fit results in a temperature of 20700  k and a @xmath1  value of 3.34 , in good agreement with the photometric temperature . the detection of metal lines ( such as the absorption lines in bd+33@xmath222642 discussed by napiwotzki et al . , @xcite ) could help to decide between the two temperatures .",
    "simulations with theoretical spectra , however , show that due to the low resolution of our data we can not expect to see any metal lines .",
    "any decision will therefore have to await better data .",
    "we keep the cooler temperature for all further analysis because of the good agreement with the photometric indices .",
    "b2004 was one of only four post - ehb candidate stars present in the uit color - magnitude diagram of ngc  6752 reported by landsman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and the position of b2004 in the @xmath16@xmath1  plot ( fig .",
    "3 ) is consistent with post - ehb tracks .",
    "landsman et al .",
    "estimated @xmath0= 45000  k and @xmath5  = 2.12 for b2004 on the basis of iue spectrophotometry .",
    "however , the iue photometry of b2004 had large uncertainties due to the presence of the nearby ( @xmath23 distant ) blue hb star b1995 , and the @xmath0(37000  k ) and luminosity ( @xmath5  = 1.94 ) of b2004 derived here should be more accurate .",
    "spectroscopic analyses of the other three post - ehb candidate stars ( b852 , b1754 , and b4380 ) in ngc  6752 were presented by moehler et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "the four post - ehb stars in ngc  6752 occupy a fairly narrow range in temperature ( 4.5 @xmath24 @xmath0  @xmath4 4.6 ) and luminosity ( @xmath25 @xmath5  @xmath26 ) , and are separated by a large luminosity gap ( 0.5  dex ) from stars on the populous ehb . as discussed by landsman et al.(@xcite ) , these two characteristics are consistent with the non - canonical hb models of sweigart ( @xcite ) , which include helium mixing on the rgb .",
    "however , a more definitive test of ehb evolutionary tracks will require a larger sample of post - ehb stars .",
    "among the seven uit - selected uv - bright stars observed in four globular clusters , we find three post - early agb stars and four post - ehb stars , but no genuine post - agb stars .",
    "this can be understood by different evolutionary time scales for these stages and by the hb morphology of the globular clusters observed : ngc  6752 shows only an almost vertical extended blue horizontal branch , which means that there is a lack of possible progenitors for post - agb stars . in ngc  2808",
    "the more luminous uv - bright stars could not be observed from the ground due to their proximity to the cluster center .",
    "the long blue tail of this cluster , on the other hand , provides plenty of progenitors for post - ehb stars .",
    "m  4 and ngc  6723 lack ehb stars - it is therefore no surprise that we do not find any post - ehb stars in these two clusters .",
    "the blue hb stars found in both clusters are potential progenitors of post - early agb stars .",
    "we find that post - ehb stars have sub - solar helium abundances , similar to their progenitors , which are identified with subdwarf b stars known in the field of the milky way , while the post - early agb stars show more or less solar helium abundances .",
    "this difference is not unexpected , because the diffusive processes at work on the hb are counteracted by convection and mass loss on the agb and afterwards .",
    "the present results suggest that post - early agb stars might be more numerous than post - agb stars in globular clusters with a blue hb .",
    "theoretical simulations would be useful to determine whether the relative populations of post - agb and post - early agb stars can be accommodated using existing post - hb evolutionary tracks . for example , in the models of dorman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , post - early agb stars arise only from hb stars within a narrow temperature range near @xmath27 @xmath0@xmath28 4.25 .",
    "however , any additional mass - loss processes , either on the hot hb or during the early agb , would extend the @xmath0  range of the progenitors of post - early agb stars to cooler hb stars .",
    "such processes would also reduce the number of pn candidates and thereby reduce the discrepancy between the predicted and observed number of pne ( jacoby et al . , @xcite )",
    ". further study of the various globular cluster uv - bright stars ( post - ehb , post - early agb , and post - agb ) should provide important clues about the mass loss history of post - hb evolutionary phases .",
