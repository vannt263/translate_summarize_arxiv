    "water@xcite , molten silicon@xcite and silica glasses@xcite are common examples of network - forming liquids which are distinguished from simple fluids ( like liquid argon ) by the presence of complex intermolecular interactions allowing bond - formation only in favoured directions .",
    "similar ability is also seen in macro - molecular systems such as colloidal particles with patchy interactions@xcite . due to their propensity toward forming extensive networked structures , especially in supercooled states ,",
    "such liquids show many intriguing properties such as isobaric density maxima , negative thermal expansion coefficients(@xmath0 ) , and increase in the isothermal compressibility(@xmath1 ) and isobaric heat capacity(@xmath2 ) upon supercooling . also ,",
    "network - formers exhibit polymorphism i.e. existence of multiple crystalline as well as amorphous states varying in local coordination and density@xcite . over the years a lot of theoretical , computational and experimental effort has been made in order to understand the origin of such anomalous properties of network - formers especially water@xcite .",
    "it is now well established from a microscopic point of view that the anomalous properties of water are related to the existence of high and low density forms@xcite of the supercooled liquid in addition to the several stable states of ice .",
    "the metastable liquid - liquid critical point@xcite in water , buried deep within the ( stable ) ice phase can , nevertheless , crucially influence the dynamics of nucleation and amorphization .",
    "a very similar scenario has recently been proposed for liquid silicon@xcite which suggests that thermodynamical anomalies may be expected for any substance which has low , as well as high , density crystalline states . since low energy open crystals are most easily ( though not exclusively ) formed in systems of molecules with highly directional bonding e.g. the hydrogen bond network in water , strongly orientation dependent interactions appear to be a prerequisite for water - like properties@xcite .",
    "while the connection between directional bonding , polymorphism , liquid - liquid phase transitions and thermodynamic anomalies is established , the univeral nature of this connection opens up many new avenues of investigation .",
    "what is the effect of confining fields and substrates on the properties of networked liquids ?",
    "what happens to the network driven under shear flow ?",
    "how does one characterize the dynamics of network formation ? to answer these , and other similar questions one ideally needs a simple and generic model which is amenable to simulation on the computer , as well as accessible to fairly simple theoretical analyses . though such generic models do exist , they are either idealized , as in a lattice model@xcite , or not much simpler to handle than fully realistic water ( or silica ) models@xcite ; the most time consuming part being an accurate treatment of molecular rotations and translation - rotation coupling at high densities@xcite .    in this paper , we describe a simple and generic _",
    "atomistic _ model system which shows many of the characteristics of network forming liquids without the complication of molecular rotations .",
    "our model consists of particles @xmath3 which have an internal coordinate @xmath4 . unlike an angular coordinate ,",
    "@xmath4 are discrete and can take only one of two possible values @xmath5 .",
    "the interaction between particle pairs @xmath6 is strongly directional and depends on the displacement @xmath7 as well as the values of @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "the internal state @xmath4 may be thought of as mimicking rotations though it is not necessary to do so .",
    "our main results are the following . despite the simplicity of the model",
    ", we obtain a rich phase diagram ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) using finite - size scaled block analysis technique@xcite .",
    "the system has two distinct crystalline phases viz . a low density honeycomb lattice ( hs ) and a closed packed triangular crystal ( ts ) .",
    "these crystals melt into a liquid ( l ) or sublimate to a vapor ( g ) under appropriate conditions ( fig.[fig.2](a)-(d ) ) .",
    "remarkably , the hs phase coexists with a liquid which is of _ higher _ density than the solid ; very similar to water and ( normal ) ice at atmospheric temperatures and pressures .",
    "the liquid phase at low temperatures shows anomalous variation of pressure and density with temperature similar to that of water and silicon .",
    "correlations in the liquid phase@xcite begin to show strong directional modulations before such anomalies arise pointing to the formation of a dynamic network within the liquid .",
    "because of the simplicity of our model , such correlations can easily be obtained from perturbative , liquid state integral equation theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the essential features of the model and provide details of our simulations .",
    "we discuss our results focusing on the complete density - temperature phase - diagram of the system , anomalous properties and the development of short - range order in section 3 .",
    "we conclude in section 4 pointing out some directions of future work",
    ".     plane as obtained from our simulations .",
    "the red circles , obtained from block - analysis technique , show the gas ( g ) and hexagonal - solid ( hs ) densities at different temperatures . the black squares , obtained from pressure - density isotherms , show the phase boundaries of hs - liquid ( l ) , hs - triangular - solid(ts ) and l - ts coexistance regions .",
    "the solid lines joining the red circles and black squares are guides to the eye .",
    "the two phase coexistence regions are shaded in gray .",
    "also shown is the locus of the pressure - minima as a dotted line.,width=302 ]     md - steps for ( a ) @xmath9 showing the g - hs co - existence , ( b ) @xmath10 showing the hs phase , ( c ) @xmath11 showing the l phase , ( d ) @xmath12 showing hs - ts co - existance.,width=226 ]",
    "our system consists of @xmath13 particles in a box of area @xmath14 , with @xmath15 mixture of particles with the internal coordinates @xmath16 interacting with each other through a simple pairwise - additive 2-body interaction in two dimensions .",
    "the interaction potential between particles @xmath17 and @xmath18 , separated by the radius vector @xmath7 , viz .",
    "@xmath19 may be decomposed as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the magnitude and @xmath22 the angle @xmath7 makes with the @xmath23-axis .",
    "the isotropic ( @xmath24 independent ) parts of the potential are given by , @xmath25 with @xmath26 $ ] , the usual @xmath27 lennard - jones interaction ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the position and depth of the minimum in @xmath30 respectively and , @xmath31 where , @xmath32 with @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "finally , the angle dependent part , @xmath35    in fig.[fig.3 ] we have plotted the full interaction potential as a function of @xmath36 for two cases , namely when @xmath37 ( red / light grey curve ) and @xmath38 ( blue / dark grey curve ) along the direction @xmath39 .",
    "the form of the potential ensures that an interchange of the labels @xmath17 and @xmath18 is accompanied by a rotation of the potential by @xmath40 .    , and opposite :",
    "blue / dark grey curve @xmath41 values for @xmath42 .",
    "the plots are along the @xmath43 x - axis where the potential has the deepest minimum .",
    "inset top left : polar plot of the angular part of the potential for @xmath44 and @xmath45 showing the three directions along which the potential has minima .",
    "inset top right : the geometries for the two distinct cases are pictorially illustrated.,width=302 ]    the units for distances and energies are the same as in a lennard - jones system , viz . @xmath46 and @xmath29 and for simplicity we have taken @xmath47 without loss of generality .      we perform molecular dynamics simulation@xcite with @xmath48 particles in a two - dimensional rectangular box of area a using a standard velocity  -verlet algorithm taking care to choose an integration time step @xmath49 such that the total energy(e ) is conserved to @xmath50 in @xmath51 or better@xcite .",
    "we perform equilibration runs in constant n , a , t ensemble , while production runs are performed in the constant n , a , e ensemble.the temperature is fixed by rescaling the velocities and thermodynamic quantities are obtained after equilibration starting from either a honeycomb or a triangular crystal depending on the density .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in both directions . in each state , we equilibrated the system for @xmath52 time steps and then calculated time - averages for @xmath53 time steps .",
    "we obtain most of the phase diagram shown in fig.[fig.1 ] using the block analysis technique@xcite which has been used in the past for similar systems and has been described in detail .",
    "briefly , the simulation box is divided into @xmath54 equal sized blocks and the local density is evaluated for each block . from the block densities one can construct the block density probability distribution @xmath55 for every block indexed by @xmath54 . in a single phase region , this distribution function is a simple gaussian centered about the mean density @xmath56 with a width which depends on @xmath54 and the isothermal compressibility of the system @xmath57 . in a co - existence region , the distribution function consists of a sum of two gaussians each centered on the densities of the co - existing phases , which are then obtained by fitting a sum of appropriately chosen gaussians and extrapolating the resulting co - existence densities to the thermodynamic limit @xmath58 . in order that the block - analysis technique works , the co",
    "- existing densities need to be well separated .",
    "the block analysis technique therefore works best for liquid  -gas and solid  -gas coexistence . for parts of the phase diagram where the co - existence regions are narrow",
    ", we obtain co - existing densities in the usual way from pressure isotherms using a maxwell s equal - area construction . apart from co - existence densities ,",
    "we also calculate pair distribution functions for like and unlike @xmath4 to characterize the various phases .     for a few values of @xmath54 in the ( a ) in the hs region(@xmath59 , @xmath60 ) and ( b ) g - hs co - existence region ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) .",
    "the lines joining the points are guides to the eye . in ( b ) , we have included two gaussians ( dashed red curves ) which were fitted to the data for @xmath63 , width=264 ]",
    "we obtain the density - temperature phase diagram for this system using the block - analysis@xcite technique along with finite - size scaling described above . in fig.[fig.4 ] ( a ) we show the density distribution curves for various values of @xmath54 in a region where a single homogeneous phase ( the honeycomb solid , hs ) is stable . each of the curves may be represented by single gaussians with the curves becoming sharper as @xmath54 decreases as expected .",
    "since we work in the constant density ensemble , the corresponding distribution function for @xmath64 is a trivial delta function at @xmath56 .",
    "in contrast , when the system is in a two  -phase region , we expect the density distribution to be bi - modal whenever the size of the blocks are comparable to the size of the heterogeneities .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig.4 ] ( b ) where we have obtained @xmath55 for g - hs coexistence .",
    "for the largest block size shown i.e. for @xmath65 , the distribution is still uni - modal , although it develops a prominent shoulder . for @xmath66 , however , the two peaks can be clearly resolved which gives us the coexisting gas and solid densities .",
    "it is possible that the difference in the coexisting densities is so small that the bi - modal structure of the density distribution can not be resolved .",
    "this happens when the coexisting phases are liquid and solid or two different solids . in this case , as mentioned , we use pressure isotherms to determine the coexistence densities . the pressure isotherms across the l - ts coexistence region",
    "are shown in fig.[fig.5 ] for three temperatures .",
    "the computed coexistence densities lie along the dashed curves as shown .",
    "the complete density - temperature phase - diagram is shown in fig.[fig.1 ] and snapshot pictures of a few of the featured phases are shown in fig.[fig.2 ] . despite the relative simplicity of the interactions , our system shows a rather complex phase behavior .",
    "firstly , there are two very different crystalline structures , the honeycomb and triangular solids , hs and ts . while the former has an open structure with strong directional bonding , the latter",
    "is close packed .",
    "the hs solid can coexist with either a low density gas , g , or with a liquid , l , which has a density higher than itself .",
    "this unique feature is reminiscent of many networked liquids such as water .",
    "the triangular solid ts , can be in coexistence with l or even with another solid viz .",
    "again this is a feature common in the water - ice system where various low and high density forms of ice may coexist with each other for appropriate values of the pressure .",
    "isotherms along @xmath67 ( red ) , @xmath68 ( green ) and @xmath69(blue ) .",
    "the flat region is the l - ts coexistence region .",
    "the estimated coexistence densities lie on the dashed curves as shown.,width=226 ]      networked liquids which coexist with solids of lower density show anomalous behaviour in many thermodynamic quantities . to investigate this",
    "we plot pressure - temperature curves along different _ iso - chores _ in fig.[fig.6](a ) and each of these curves show a minimum .",
    "a minimum in the pressure iso - chore is equivalent to a maximum in density along an isobar as can be easily deduced as follows@xcite . noting that @xmath70 where @xmath1 is the isothermal compressibility , @xmath71 is the volume - expansion coefficient",
    ", it is easy to see that an extremum in the isochore is related to vanishing @xmath71 . to determine the nature of the extremum we consider the second derivative , @xmath72 thus , a density maximum ( positive @xmath73 ) leads to a pressure minimum .",
    "further , @xmath57 itself may show an extremum at the point of minimum pressure , a fact which is borne out in our system and shown in fig.[fig.6 ] ( b ) .",
    "isochores at @xmath74(red ) , @xmath75(blue ) , @xmath76(pink ) and @xmath77(green ) .",
    "dashed lines are drawn as a guides to the eye .",
    "( b ) the isothermal compressibility @xmath57 at @xmath78 .",
    "note that the minimum in the pressure as well as in the compressibility is very similar to many common network forming liquids.,width=340 ]      thermodynamic anomalies arise in a liquid as a result of a metastable liquid - liquid phase separation between a low density liquid with strong directional correlations and a more isotropic high density variant at temperatures where the solid phase is stable@xcite .",
    "one therefore expects that as the temperature is reduced , the homogeneous liquid would develop short ranged correlations which are strongly orientation dependent . in order to investigate this in our system ,",
    "we have computed density - density correlation functions both from our simulations and from a liquid - state integral equation theory .     at @xmath79 obtained from ( a ) simulations and ( b )",
    "theory and @xmath80 at the same temperature obtained from ( c ) simulations and ( d ) theory.,width=302 ]    in two dimensions , the radial - distribution function @xmath81 is defined as the probability of finding a pair of particles within @xmath82 and @xmath83 of each other given that one of particles is at the origin . in our case , we need distribution functions for both like , @xmath84 , and unlike , @xmath80 , values of the internal coordinate . similar to the pair interaction , a permutation of the indices @xmath4 in @xmath85 results in a rotation in space by @xmath40 , so that the functions @xmath80and @xmath86 are related by this transformation .",
    "we obtain these distribution functions at various temperatures and densities in the region where the liquid phase is stable by averaging over uncorrelated configurations .",
    "while @xmath84 is relatively insensitive to temperature , the nature of @xmath80 depends strongly on @xmath87 .",
    "we have illustrated this in fig.[fig.7 ] . at low temperatures , when the system is dominated by it s potential energy which has a @xmath88-fold symmetry , @xmath80 becomes large in magnitude compared to @xmath84 , long ranged and shows strong directionality pointing to the formation of a prominent short ranged network in the liquid phase .",
    "this network is three fold coordinated similar to the hs phase and disappears when the temperature is increased .    in order to further understand our results",
    ", we compare the pair distribution functions obtained from our simulations with the results of an approximate integral equation theory which we describe below . unlike a molecular fluid , in our case we need to set up equations for just two functions corresponding to like and unlike values of @xmath89 as in a binary mixture .",
    "the correlation functions are however direction dependent . in this case",
    ", we devise a perturbative scheme , where the direction dependent part is treated as a `` small '' perturbation over a set of isotropic functions .",
    "this allows us to quickly compute distribution functions which are in agreement with those obtained from simulations at high temperatures , but begins to deviate as the temperature is lowered .",
    "nevertheless , our simple scheme is sufficient to show the emergence of the short - ranged directional order indicating network formation .    to begin , consider the ornstein - zernike equation for a binary mixture in fourier space , viz .",
    "@xmath90 where the indices @xmath91 denote two species of particles , @xmath92 are the pair correlation functions , @xmath93 are the concentrations of species @xmath94 ( @xmath95 in our case ) , and @xmath96 are the direct correlation functions .",
    "note that we have suppressed the spatial coordinate for simplicity .    in order to be useful , eq.[oz ]",
    "needs to be supplemented ( or closed ) with another equation involving the unknown functions @xmath97 and @xmath96 . for short - ranged potentials",
    "an approximate closure relation which is known to work well is the percus  -yevick ( py ) closure given by , @xmath98(1 + y_{\\alpha,\\beta}({\\bf r } ) ) - y_{\\alpha,\\beta}({\\bf r } ) - 1 \\label{py}\\ ] ] with @xmath99 the _ indirect _ correlation function and @xmath100 the pair potential .",
    "we shall show that within our perturbative scheme , all the correlation functions may also be decomposed in the same way as @xmath101 into isotropic and @xmath24 dependent parts as given in section 2a , namely , @xmath102 and similarly for @xmath103 .     for ( a ) @xmath104 , ( c ) @xmath79 and @xmath105 for ( b ) @xmath104 , ( d ) @xmath79.,width=340 ]    it is straight forward to show , after some algebra , that eqn.[oz ] reduces to , @xmath106 where @xmath107 and we have kept only terms up - to leading order in @xmath108 .",
    "the py closure , similarly translates to , @xmath109 \\nonumber \\\\ & & - ( \\delta y)e^{-\\beta(v_{0}')}\\sinh(\\beta \\delta v ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta c & = & ( \\delta y)[e^{-\\beta(v_{0}')}\\cosh(\\beta \\delta v ) - 1 ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & - ( 1+y_{0}^{'})e^{-\\beta(v_{0}')}\\sinh(\\beta \\delta v ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{py2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a further , ad - hoc , approximation simplifies the problem considerably ; the aposteriori justification being given by its ability to reproduce some of the more essential features of the correlation functions as compared with the output of our simulations .",
    "accordingly , we take @xmath110 in the expression for @xmath111 in eq.[py2 ] . in this case the eqns .",
    "[ oz ] and [ py ] factorize into isotropic and @xmath24 dependent parts .",
    "we solve the resulting integral equations for the isotropic functions self - consistently and then calculate the @xmath24 dependendent pair correlation functions by iterating eq.[py2 ] once .",
    "our results are compared in figs.[fig.7 ] and [ fig.8 ] . in spite of the approximations made , we find fair agreement between simulations and our integral equation theory especially at high temperatures . in fig.[fig.7 ]",
    "( a ) and ( b ) we show plots of the radial distribution function @xmath112 obtained from simulations and solution of the integral equations respectively .",
    "none of them show any strong directional dependence . on the other hand",
    "a similar plot of @xmath113 shows a very strong three fold directional dependence pointing out the emergence of a local three fold coordinated , short - ranged network structure . in fig.[fig.8 ] we plot the @xmath24-averaged radial distribution functions @xmath114 and @xmath105 from theory and simulations both at high and low temperature .",
    "while at high temperature fig.[fig.8](a)and(b ) the pair distribution function does not show any preference for either like or unlike species , one observes in both the simulation data as well as the solutions to the integral equations , a strong preference for unlike oriented neighbors emerging as the temperature is reduced fig.[fig.8](c)and(d ) , due to the development of a local network .",
    "since the potential energy and hence the @xmath24-dependent part has a significant effect on the system at low temperatures , the radial distribution functions obtained from theory and simulation however do not match quantitatively in the low - temperature limit . more specifically , at temperatures where our integral equation are valid , the local network is not strong enough to give rise to thermodynamic anomalies which occur for cooler liquids .",
    "better approximations by keeping orientation dependent terms to all orders are needed to yield accurate correlation functions in the desired range at the cost of substantially increasing the computational complexity .",
    "we have introduced a model - system in two - dimensions to study whether network formation in a system leads to polymorphism and thermodynamic anomalies even if molecular rotational degrees of freedom are not explicitly taken into account .",
    "while the connection between directional bonding and the existence of multiple states with differences in density which causes density anomalies has been established quite generally@xcite , our model shows that these properties are robust against rather drastic simplifications of the nature of the rotational states .",
    "we study the equilibrium properties of this system in detail and show that , though simple , the model shows many features of real liquids like water .",
    "our studies should be of direct relevance to the biologically important case of confined water@xcite where rotations are strongly coupled to translational degrees of freedom not unlike the case studied here .",
    "indeed , we expect strong network formation in such cases and the liquid should show prominent thermodynamic anomalies .",
    "calculations in this direction are in progress and will be published elsewhere . in future , we aim to use our model in more complicated situations to discuss issues such as shear flow and coupling to external fields to further study the properties of confined network formers .",
