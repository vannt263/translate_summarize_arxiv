    "the description of the electronic states of transition metal oxides with partly filled @xmath8 orbitals is not an easy task , and one usually looks for some simplifications .",
    "models for manganites are complex as they involve partly filled @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals @xcite .",
    "systems with partly filled @xmath5 orbitals and empty @xmath6 orbitals , such as for titanates @xcite or vanadates @xcite or with completely filled @xmath5 and partly filled @xmath6 orbitals as in cuprates @xcite or nickelates @xcite are much easier to investigate .",
    "such systems can be realized if the gap separating @xmath5 from @xmath6 orbital states ( induced by crystal - field effects ) is sufficiently large .",
    "the transition - metal oxides with @xmath12 ions are even more challenging as there electron correlations are somewhat weaker and simultaneously spin - orbit coupling plays an important role .",
    "therefore one has to treat @xmath12 electrons as both itinerant and strongly correlated , in the vicinity of a metal - insulator transition .",
    "the compound which belongs to this class and received a lot of attention is sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 as it became a candidate for a @xmath9-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "recent progress in photoemission technique made it possible to investigate the many - body effects both in bulk and surface bands of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "spin - orbital entangled states have been seen recently in spin- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "such states arise in correlated transition metal oxides either on superexchange bonds @xcite or locally due to strong spin - orbit coupling at transition - metal sites @xcite .",
    "indeed , these quantum effects play an important role in mott insulators with @xmath12 ions @xcite and in these systems doped by @xmath13 elements @xcite .",
    "in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 the experiments support the earlier implementation of spin - orbit coupling within the local density approximation with coulomb interaction @xmath14 treated in lda+@xmath14 approach which show that both coulomb @xmath14 and the spin - orbit coupling are necessary for a correct description of the fermi surface in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 was extensively studied in the past @xcite and it was established that the orbital physics plays here an important role @xcite . in ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 the bandwidth is smaller but the effects of spin - orbit coupling are even more pronounced @xcite .    due to a rather large crystal - field splitting between @xmath5 to @xmath6 levels",
    "@xmath15 ev in ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite , one might expect that these compounds are also purely @xmath5 systems .",
    "this picture was also supported by the earlier studies of electronic structure in ca@xmath16sr@xmath17ruo@xmath1 by photoemission @xcite .",
    "orbital polarization is then helpful to understand the x - ray absorption measurements and is of importance in describing the insulating state of ca@xmath16sr@xmath17ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a  unique feature of ca@xmath16sr@xmath17ruo@xmath1 is that slight changes in lattice parameters can induce drastic modifications of the character of their electronic ground states  sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is metallic and superconducting at low temperature @xcite , whereas ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is distorted and undergoes a metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "interest in these materials is also motivated by very unusual invar effect reported recently @xcite which suggests spin - orbital entanglement @xcite in the ground state .",
    "recently a simple tight - binding model was employed to investigate the superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the simplest @xmath2 model would just include three @xmath5 orbitals per ru and three @xmath18 orbitals per o ion . however , there are serious doubts about the validity of this simplified physical picture . first , there are _ ab initio _ cluster+embedding computations by kaplan and soullard @xcite who claim that the @xmath9-orbital charges on oxygens ( in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ) are not close to formal 6.0 as they follow from the ionic model , but are instead close to 5.0 , and that in addition @xmath6 levels are partly occupied . at the same time",
    "the transfer of charge from any strontium ion ( to ruthenium - oxide layer ) is smaller than a formal value of 2 electrons .",
    "secondly , a similar system , namely coo@xmath0 layer was also believed to be pure @xmath5 systems . however , it was shown @xcite that @xmath6 orbitals ( in a doped system ) can become very important , even in the absence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we show below that the total electron density which follows from the idealized ionic model with formal electronic charges does not describe correctly the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2 model with reduced electron density based on _ ab initio _ calculations @xcite gives results which agree with experiment .    to resolve the question about actual electron density within @xmath6 orbitals in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 we constructed a multiband charge - transfer model and performed unrestricted hartree - fock computations on a finite ruo@xmath1 cluster which contains @xmath19 ru ions and @xmath20 oxygen ions",
    " half of them located within the same plane as ru ions , while the second half belonging to the elongated ruo@xmath21 octahedra and surrounding the plane from above and below , being in out - of - plane ( apical ) positions .",
    "we imposed cyclic boundary conditions .",
    "the model involves ( per a single ruo@xmath1 unit ) five @xmath12 orbitals on ru and @xmath22 oxygen @xmath18 orbitals per unit cell occupied by : ( i ) @xmath23 electrons , according to the formal and idealized ionic model ; ( ii ) the electron number lower by at least one electron , i.e. , @xmath24 electrons or even smaller ( we study below the case of @xmath25 electrons ) , as found in ref .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the multiband model which includes all @xmath12 states at ruthenium ions and @xmath18 states at oxygen ions .",
    "the parameters of the model are specified in sec .",

    "the hartree - fock approximation for the coulomb interactions is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : hf ] , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : resu ] we present the results of numerical calculations and we introduce the concept of self - doping with respect to the electron densities in the ionic model .",
    "the paper is concluded with a short discussion and summary of the main results in sec .",
    "[ sec : summa ] . in the appendix",
    "we give the hopping elements @xmath2 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "in this section we introduce the @xmath2 charge - transfer hamiltonian for ruo@xmath1 plane ( such as realized in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ) .",
    "it consists of several parts , @xmath26 the different terms in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) stand for the kinetic energy ( @xmath27 ) , spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath28 ) , crystal - field splittings which are diagonal in the @xmath29 orbital basis ( @xmath30 ) , and the intraatomic coulomb interactions ( @xmath31 )  they all are explained below .",
    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian is : @xmath32 where we employ a general notation , with @xmath33 standing for the creation of an electron at site @xmath34 in an orbital @xmath35 with up and down spin , @xmath36 .",
    "the model includes all @xmath12 orbital states per ru atom , @xmath37 , and three @xmath18 orbitals per oxygen atom , @xmath38 . alternatively , i.e.",
    ", choosing a more intuitive notation , we can write @xmath39 for @xmath8 orbitals , while @xmath40 for @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "the matrix @xmath41 is assumed to be non - zero only for nearest neighbor ruthenium - oxygen @xmath2 pairs , and for nearest neighbor oxygen - oxygen @xmath4 pairs .",
    "the next nearest hopping elements , in particular direct ruthenium - ruthenium ones , and those between the @xmath9 orbitals of neighboring apical oxygens are neglected .",
    "the nonzero @xmath41 elements are listed in the appendix .      formally , simplified spin - orbit part @xmath28 of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) has a similar mathematical structure to the kinetic part @xmath27 @xcite , with @xmath42 elements restricted to single ruthenium sites , @xmath43 where the summation runs only over ruthenium sites and where we explicitly use @xmath44 operators for the @xmath12 orbitals at ru sites .",
    "the derivation of spin - orbit coupling starts from a single - site model . using the @xmath45 basis one evaluates the full matrix of scalar products , @xmath46 , of angular momentum @xmath47 with spin @xmath48 operator ( at site @xmath49 ) . the individual single - site terms in @xmath50",
    "are defined by on - site hopping - like elements , @xmath51 ( between different spin and orbital states ) , and one arrives at the matrix form in eq .",
    "( [ so - part ] ) .    as we use here the basis of real @xmath12 orbitals ( and not the spherical harmonics ) several spin - orbit elements turn out to be purely imaginary ( hence the hermitian hamiltonian is not real but complex )",
    ". the elements of the matrix @xmath52 for a ruthenium site @xmath49 are the following ones ( for a similar result consult fig . 6 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ,    @xmath53,\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is the spin - orbit coupling parameter and where the columns and rows are labeled in the following order : @xmath55    note that the consequence of finite spin - orbit coupling @xmath54 is nonconservation of the @xmath56th component of the total spin and therefore the obtained ground state wave function is not a product of two slater determinants for @xmath57- and @xmath58-spin .",
    "in some cases the spin - orbit coupling @xmath28 can be treated as a minor perturbation and can be neglected when the average value of local angular momentum ( at site @xmath49 ) is quenched to zero due to suitably strong crystal - field effects and low enough local symmetry ( reduced by nearest neighbor atoms ) .",
    "then , the spin - orbit hamiltonian can contribute to total energy only as second - order correction .",
    "such a reasoning however allows one to make only qualitative predictions .",
    "an explicit treatment of spin - orbit coupling causes some difficulties .",
    "it is likely that the true ground states are not homogeneous in space , e.g. involving spin spirals or other micro - modulations , thus they may be considered intractable within hartree - fock computations for @xmath2 clusters ( they have too many order parameters to converge ) .",
    "one can only hope that these micro - modulations are of secondary importance .",
    "we assume this scenario and to have a tractable model we decided to use a simplified approach .",
    "namely , we break the symmetry along natural quantization axis which is the @xmath56-th axis ( perpendicular to ruo@xmath1 layer ) .",
    "we emphasize that the averages of local spin components aligned parallel to the @xmath59 plane are assumed to be zero . to present this assumption in a more transparent way we can write down the formula for a local spin - flip , @xmath60 , and a similar one for @xmath61 . thus the requirements that @xmath62 are equivalent to setting to zero the following order parameters with opposite spins , @xmath63 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : resu ] we report a study of charge space - homogeneous solutions .",
    "all occupation numbers , i.e. , primary order parameters , are assumed to be the same for equivalent ruthenium ions and similar for oxygen ions .",
    "when studying the possibility of antiferromagnetism there are two sublattices  thus the number of order parameters doubles . looking for charge space - homogeneous ground states",
    "can be considered a simplification but from another point of view it can be treated as a consequence of strong long - range interionic electrostatic interactions .",
    "these interactions are not explicitly included in the model ( [ model ] ) at present .",
    "we remark that long - range interionic interactions can not be easily incorporated into a typical @xmath2 model but instead they can be accounted for by requiring that individual ionic charges are space - homogeneous in accordance with crystal symmetry .",
    "let us now return to the @xmath2 hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) .",
    "the next part of the model @xmath30 is diagonal in the orbital basis and depends only on electron number operators .",
    "it takes into account the effects of crystal field and the difference of reference orbital energies ( here we employ the electron notation ) , @xmath64 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals , both for empty states without the hartree terms which follow from @xmath31 .",
    "below we fix the reference energy @xmath65 for @xmath8 orbitals to zero , hence we use only @xmath66 as a parameter and write : @xmath67 here the first sum is restricted to oxygen sites , while the second one runs over ruthenium sites .",
    "what concerns the value of @xmath66 , it could be different for in - plane and for out - of - plane ( apical ) oxygens . according to the earlier studies @xcite",
    "this difference can be as large as 1.5 ev .",
    "but such a large value follows from a simplified procedure of fitting electronic bands to the lda results . in the framework of the present @xmath2 model one should expect much smaller difference , if any .",
    "the zero difference was assumed in computations performed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we also adopt this value . here",
    "we remark that our test hartree - fock computations performed using a big 1.5 ev splitting give large differences in charge occupation between in - plane and apical oxygens , in disagreement with the results of the population analysis in ref .",
    "this choice is indeed unrealistic as in addition one obtains only ferromagnetic ground states , see below .",
    "let us return again to @xmath30 .",
    "the vector containing the elements of @xmath68 can be expressed as @xmath69 + d_2 \\ , \\left [ \\begin{array}{r } 0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\1\\\\0 \\end{array } \\right ] + d_3 \\ , \\left [ \\begin{array}{r } 0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\1 \\end{array } \\right ] .",
    "\\ ] ] it includes the orbital splittings of @xmath12 orbitals in the tetragonal crystal field .",
    "the constant @xmath70 serves as a crude estimate of the splitting between the orbital @xmath71 and the orbital doublet @xmath72 , i.e. , when taking into account only @xmath30 while neglecting the remaining parts of the full hamiltonian , . for @xmath73 ( like in ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ) in the presence of a tetragonal distortion of ruo@xmath21 octahedra the @xmath71 orbital has a lower energy and is occupied ( in the atomic configuration ) by two electrons , while @xmath74 and @xmath75 are occupied by one electron each  then the energy gain is @xmath70 , i.e. , such an occupation pattern is more stable . for @xmath76 ( like in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ) the doublet @xmath72 has a lower energy and is more stable .",
    "the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 follow from the estimates of the splitting between @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "they do not influence the ground state energy if only @xmath5 orbitals are occupied , while there is a punishment ( by the value of @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) for each electron occupying @xmath79 or @xmath80 level respectively .",
    "these parameters @xmath81 are much larger than @xmath70 in the case of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and the difference between them is rather small .",
    "jahn - teller part can be neglected in the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) .",
    "the exception is the elongation of bonds between ruthenium and apical oxygens which could be considered as a frozen global ( static ) @xmath82 jahn - teller distortion @xcite but it is much simpler to include it by a proper renormalization of the crystal - field splittings .",
    "note that in the other compound ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 jahn - teller effects are large ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) and as a result the symmetry of the corresponding ruo@xmath1 plane is significantly lowered .",
    "the last part of the multiband @xmath2 hamiltonian @xmath31 stands for strong on - site coulomb interactions . for the @xmath8 orbitals at ruthenium sites it includes hubbard intraorbital repulsion @xmath83 , hund s exchange @xmath84 and pair hopping also given by @xmath84 ,    @xmath85    here @xmath84 is the tensor of hund s on - site interorbital exchange elements for @xmath8 orbitals which can be expressed using racah parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite ( see also table i given by horsch in ref .",

    "have been studied @xcite and it was also suggested that this coupling supports the triplet superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy between different hund s exchange elements @xmath89 may be neglected as long as one may limit oneself to the orbitals of the same symmetry , i.e. , either to @xmath5 or to @xmath6 orbitals @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ hubbard - intra ] ) as follows @xmath90 similarly , local coulomb interactions at oxygen sites ( for @xmath18 orbitals ) are given by @xmath91    where all off - diagonal elements @xmath92 are equal as they connect the orbitals of the same symmetry , i.e. , @xmath93 . up to now this latter part ( @xmath94 ) was neglected in the majority of studies , i.e. , they assume @xmath95 . as a compensation",
    "some effective and appropriate modification of the charge - transfer energy has to be performed .",
    "indeed , it has been shown for la@xmath16sr@xmath17cuo@xmath1 cuprates employing constrained local density approach that the estimation of @xmath96 is very sensitive to the assumed value of @xmath97 @xcite  the value of @xmath98 ev yields @xmath99 ev , while @xmath100 ev yields @xmath101 ev . one notes that there is a roughly linear dependence of @xmath96 on @xmath97 to reproduce a constant value of the charge - transfer gap in hartree - fock @xcite ; at the same time the estimated value of @xmath83 remains more or less constant .",
    "unfortunately , not much is known about the real value of @xmath97 ( [ delta ] ) for different compounds .",
    "estimates based on lda results for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 gave the value @xmath102 ev @xcite .",
    "this value is much lower than @xmath103 ev used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where also @xmath104 was assumed ) .",
    "all these estimations come from different fitting procedures employing numerous simplifying assumptions .",
    "one has to realize that @xmath97 ( [ delta ] ) is not an _ ab initio _ like value in the framework od @xmath2 model but rather some effective value which better should be treated as a free parameter ( the @xmath2 model itself is an effective model , and definitely not an _ ab initio _ model ) .",
    "thus in the following we will vary the value of @xmath97 from 0 to 6.0 ev .",
    "we do not consider negative values of @xmath97 as their consequence are greatly overcharged @xmath8-shells .",
    "we also remark that it has been realized nowadays that effective models with only @xmath8 orbitals are insufficient and many papers treat electronic oxygen degrees of freedom explicitly . for cuprates",

    "when only @xmath12 orbitals are used in a tight - binding ( semiempirical ) model @xcite the parameters are very different from the cases where coulomb interactions are treated in the hartree - fock approximation . here",

    "<S> motivated by the earlier experimental results and _ ab initio _ studies on the electronic structure of layered ruthenates ( sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ) we introduce and investigate the multiband @xmath2 charge transfer model describing a single ruo@xmath1 layer , similar to the charge transfer model for a single cuo@xmath0 plane including apical oxygen orbitals in high @xmath3 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the present model takes into account nearest - neighbor anisotropic ruthenium - oxygen @xmath2 and oxygen - oxygen @xmath4 hopping elements , crystal - field splittings and spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the intraorbital coulomb repulsion and hund s exchange are defined not only at ruthenium but also at oxygen ions . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the ruo@xmath1 layer can not be regarded to be a pure ruthenium @xmath5 system . </S>",
    "<S> we examine a different scenario in which ruthenium @xmath6 orbitals are partly occupied and highlight the significance of oxygen orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the predictions of an idealized model based on ionic configuration ( with @xmath7 electrons per ruo@xmath1 unit ) do not agree with the experimental facts for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 which support our finding that the electron number in the @xmath2 states is significantly smaller . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we find the electron occupation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals for a single ruo@xmath1 unit @xmath10 , being smaller by at least 11.5 electrons from that in the ionic model and corresponding to self - doping with @xmath11 . </S>"
