    "it is a long story to search for the pentaquark . in the conventional quark model , a baryon",
    "is made of three constituent quarks .",
    "however , there exist many interpretations of baryon resonance beyond the three - quark picture .",
    "for example , the hyperon resonance @xmath12 was explained as a @xmath13 bound state by many authors  @xcite . the last rise and fall of the pentaquark study happened ten years ago beginning with a claim of finding of the strange pentaquark @xmath14 with mass about 1.540  gev by the leps collaboration  @xcite .",
    "much theoretical and experimental effort was put into this field and many ideas were inspired .",
    "for example , zou @xmath15 proposed to include the pentaquark components to nucleon  @xcite . after extending to heavy flavor sector",
    "they suggested the existence of hidden charmed nucleon resonances  @xcite and the discovery potential in experiment was also discussed  @xcite .",
    "recently , the molecular state composed of a charmed meson and a nucleon was discussed in the one - boson - exchange model ( obe )  @xcite . especially , the possible hidden - charm molecular baryons with the components of an anti - charmed meson and a charmed baryon were investigated systematically in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "two hidden - charm resonances in the @xmath16 invariant mass spectrum were reported very recently by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the lower one has a mass @xmath17 mev and a wider width of @xmath18 mev , while the higher and narrower one has a mass of @xmath19 mev and a width of @xmath20 mev .",
    "the preferred @xmath21 assignments are of opposite parity , with one state having spin @xmath22 and the other @xmath23 .",
    "the high mass and observation in the @xmath16 channel suggest that these two states must have minimal quark content of @xmath24 , which can be called pentaquark - charmonium states .",
    "soon after the experimental results released , a qcd sum rule investigation was performed , by which the the @xmath0 and @xmath1 were identified as exotic hidden - charm pentaquarks composed of an anti - charmed meson and a charmed baryon @xcite .",
    "an interpretation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath25-wave @xmath6 and @xmath26 molecular states were proposed in ref .",
    "a coupled - channel calculation was performed to analyze the @xmath27 reaction and supported a @xmath7 assignment to @xmath1 as a molecular state mostly made of @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "an important feather of these two states is that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are very close to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 thresholds with mass gaps about 5 mev and 15 mev , respectively .",
    "considered the hadronic molecular stats is a loosely bound state , it is more natural to interpret the @xmath0 and @xmath1 as bound states composed of @xmath5 and @xmath6 instead of @xmath6 and @xmath30 because mass gaps between observed masses and corresponding thresholds are about 80 mev . besides , we should not be limited to s wave which provides only negative parity state .",
    "it conflicts with the lhcb experiment which suggests the opposite parities for two @xmath2 states . in this work the @xmath11 and @xmath4",
    "( numbers for mass 2520 and 2455 are omitted here and hereafter ) interactions will be studied in a bethe - salpeter equation approach  @xcite and the bound states with both positive and negative parities will be searched .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "after introduction , the detail of the dynamical study of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath31 interactions will be presented , which includes relevant effective lagrangian and a detailed derivation of effective potential .",
    "the numerical results are given in section 3 . finally , a brief summary will be given .",
    "in this work the interactions between anti - charmed meson and charmed baryon will be described by the light meson exchanges .",
    "we need to construct effective lagrangians depicting the couplings of light mesons and anti - charmed mesons or charmed baryons .    in terms of heavy quark limit and chiral symmetry , the couplings of light mesons to heavy - light charmed mesons @xmath32",
    "are constructed as @xcite , @xmath33 where constant @xmath34 mev and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the pseudoscalar and vector matrices @xmath37    the effective lagrangians depicting the charmed baryons with the light mesons with chiral symmetry , heavy quark limit and hidden local symmetry read @xcite , @xmath38 where the partial @xmath39 operates on the initial and final baryons and @xmath40 matrix is @xmath41    we list the values of the coupling constants used in the above lagrangians in table .",
    "[ coupling ] , which have been determined in literatures @xcite .",
    "the signs of the coupling constants @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not well constrained , which will be discussed later .",
    ".the parameters and coupling constants adopted in our calculation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 are in the unit of gev@xmath47 .",
    "others are in the unit of @xmath48 .",
    "[ coupling ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values in the bracket are spin - parity of the system and the cut offs in the unit of gev which produces the experimental mass within uncertainties .",
    "empirically the pole far away from the threshold provides much smaller contribution than the one near threshold .",
    "it can be also seen from the form factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffg ] ) which suppresses the contribution with two particles being off - shell .",
    "hence , the @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] are not preferred to interpret the lhcb hidden - charmed states .",
    "the lhcb collaboration stated the best fit combination finds two @xmath2 states with @xmath21 values of @xmath51 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "hence , we can identify the @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath52;\\quad p_c(4450 ) : \\bar{d}^*\\sigma_c [ 5/2^+ ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the cut off to produce the experimental mass of the @xmath0 is about 1 gev .",
    "the positive parity state @xmath53 $ ] vanishes at such cut off .",
    "the negative parity state @xmath54 may also contribute to the @xmath1 due to the similar cut off .",
    "however , the positive parity state is in @xmath55 and @xmath56 waves while the negative parity state is in @xmath57 and @xmath58 waves so that the contribution from the latter state will be suppressed .",
    "the hidden - charm states @xmath0 and @xmath1 newly observed at lhcb locate just below the @xmath11 and @xmath4 thresholds , which suggests that theses states are from the @xmath11 and @xmath4 interactions . the exchanges from pseudoscalar , vector and scalar meson exchanges are included to describe the interactions of the anti - charmed meson and charmed baryon .",
    "it is found that the vector meson plays important roles in the interactions considered in this work .",
    "a bethe - saltpeter equation approach is applied to find the bound state from the @xmath11 and @xmath4 interactions by searching the poles from the scattering amplitude .",
    "the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be identified as loosely bound states , that is , hadronic molecular states , composed of @xmath11 and @xmath4 with the spin parity @xmath7 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
