    "coulomb interactions are incorporated in a self - consistent way within the hartree approximation .",
    "the repelling electrons accumulate at the bgn edges and induce characteristic dips in the transverse potential profile .",
    "they change the band structures strongly and modify the energy gaps which thereby behave qualitatively differently compared to 2d bilayer systems , showing an unusual reduction in the sizes of the energy gaps at intermediate gate voltages .",
    "an analytical expression for the potential difference between the two layers is obtained based on the assumption of a classical capacitor and compared with self - consistent numerical calculations .",
    "they show good agreement at small gate voltages .",
    "the discrepancies found at higher voltages and small dielectric thicknesses are due to the assumption of homogeneous charge density and constant potential in the analytical model .",
    "this becomes invalid for high electron densities because the quantum mechanical effects modify the charge redistribution significantly . +",
    "a disadvantage of the single - gate structure discussed here is that due to small capacitance , the fermi energy is far above the neutrality point in the regime of the collapse of the band gap , such that this effect is not directly accessible experimentally .",
