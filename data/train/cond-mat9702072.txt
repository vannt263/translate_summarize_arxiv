    "in recent years there has been significant interest in adapting numerical ( kirkpatrick , gelatt and vecchi 1983 ) as well as analytic ( fu and anderson 1986 , mzard and pairsi 1986 ) techniques from statistical physics to provide algorithms and estimates for good approximate solutions to hard optimization problems ( yuille and kosowsky 1994 ) . in this work",
    "we formulate the problem of data clustering as that of measuring equilibrium properties of an inhomogeneous potts model .",
    "we are able to give good clustering solutions by solving the physics of this potts model .",
    "cluster analysis is an important technique in exploratory data analysis , where a priori knowledge of the distribution of the observed data is not available ( duda and hart 1973 ; jain and dubes 1988 ) .",
    "_ partitional _ clustering methods , that divide the data according to natural classes present in it , have been used in a large variety of scientific disciplines and engineering applications that include pattern recognition ( duda and hart 1973 ) , learning theory ( moody and darken 1989 ) , astrophysics ( dekel and west 1985 ) , medical image ( suzuki _ et .",
    "_ 1995 ) and data processing ( phillips _ et .",
    "1995 ) , machine translation of text ( cranias _ et .",
    "1994 ) , image compression ( karayiannis _ et .",
    "_ 1994 ) , satellite data analysis ( baraldi and parmiggiani 1995 ) , automatic target recognition ( iokibe 1994 ) , as well as speech recognition ( kosaka and sagayama 1994 ) , and analysis ( foote and silverman 1994 ) .    the goal is to find a partition of a given data set into several compact groups .",
    "each group indicates the presence of a distinct category in the measurements .",
    "the problem of partitional clustering can be formally stated as follows .",
    "determine the partition of @xmath0 given patterns @xmath1 into groups , called _",
    ", such that the patterns of a cluster are more similar to each other than to patterns in different clusters .",
    "it is assumed that either @xmath2 , the measure of dissimilarity between patterns @xmath3 and @xmath4 is provided , or that each pattern @xmath3 is represented by a point @xmath5 in a @xmath6-dimensional metric space , in which case @xmath7 .",
    "the two main approaches to partitional clustering are called _ parametric _ and _ non - parametric_. in parametric approaches some knowledge of the clusters structure is assumed and in most cases patterns can be represented by points in a @xmath6-dimensional metric space .",
    "for instance , each cluster can be parameterized by a center around which the points that belong to it are spread with a locally gaussian distribution . in many cases",
    "the assumptions are incorporated in a _ global criterion _ whose minimization yields the `` optimal '' partition of the data .",
    "the goal is to assign the data points so that the criterion is minimized .",
    "classical approaches are variance minimization , maximal likelihood and fitting gaussian mixtures . a nice example of variance minimization",
    "is the method proposed by rose , gurewitz and fox ( 1990 ) based on principles of statistical physics , which ensures an optimal solution under certain conditions .",
    "this work gave rise to other mean - field methods for clustering data ( buhmann and khnel 1993 , wong 1993 , miller and rose 1996 ) .",
    "classical examples of fitting gaussian mixtures are the isodata algorithm ( ball and hall 1967 ) or its sequential relative , the k - means algorithm ( macqueen 1967 ) in statistics , and soft competition in neural networks ( nowlan and hinton , 1991 ) .    in many cases of interest",
    ", however , there is no a priori knowledge about the data structure .",
    "then it is more natural to adopt non - parametric approaches , which make less assumptions about the model and therefore are suitable to handle a wider variety of clustering problems .",
    "usually these methods employ a _ local criterion _ , against which some attribute of the local structure of the data is tested , to construct the clusters .",
    "typical examples are hierarchical techniques such as the agglomerative and divisive methods ( see jain and dubes 1988 ) .",
    "these algorithms suffer , however , from at least one of the following limitations : ( a ) high sensitivity to initialization ; ( b ) poor performance when the data contains overlapping clusters ; ( c ) inability to handle variabilities in cluster shapes , cluster densities and cluster sizes .",
    "the most serious problem is the lack of cluster validity criteria ; in particular , none of these methods provides an index that could be used to determine the most significant partitions among those obtained in the entire hierarchy .",
    "all these algorithms tend to create clusters even when no natural clusters exist in the data .",
    "we introduced recently ( blatt , wiseman and domany 1996a 1996b 1996c ) a new approach to clustering , based on the physical properties of a magnetic system .",
    "this method has a number of rather unique advantages : it provides information about the different self organizing regimes of the data ; the number of `` macroscopic '' clusters is an _",
    "output _ of the algorithm ; hierarchical organization of the data is reflected in the manner the clusters merge or split when a control parameter ( the physical _ temperature _ ) is varied .",
    "moreover , the results are completely insensitive to the initial conditions , and the algorithm is robust against the presence of noise .",
    "the algorithm is computationally efficient ; equilibration time of the spin system scales with @xmath0 , the number of data points , and is _ independent of the embedding dimension d_.    in this paper we extend our work by providing demonstrating the efficiency and performance of the algorithm on various real - life problems .",
    "detailed comparison with other non - parametric techniques are also presented .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the magnetic model and thermodynamic definitions are introduced in section [ sec : model ] . a very efficient monte carlo method used for calculating the thermodynamic quantities",
    "is presented in section [ sec : swmethod ] .",
    "the clustering algorithm is described in section [ sec : thealgorithm ] . in section [ sec : applications ] we analyze synthetic and real data to demonstrate the main features of the method , and comparison of its performance with other techniques .",
    "[ sec : model ] we now briefly describe the physics of potts models and introduce various concepts and thermodynamic functions that will be used in our solution of the clustering problem .",
    "ferromagnetic potts models have been extensively studied for many years ( see wu 1982 for a review ) .",
    "the basic spin variable @xmath8 can take one of @xmath9 integer values : @xmath10 .",
    "in a magnetic model the potts spins are located at points @xmath3 that reside on ( or off ) the sites of some lattice .",
    "pairs of spins associated with points @xmath11 and @xmath12 are coupled by an interaction of strength @xmath13 .",
    "denote by @xmath14 a configuration of the system , @xmath15 .",
    "the energy of such a configuration is given by the hamiltonian @xmath16 where the notation @xmath17 stands for neighboring sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the contribution of a pair @xmath18 to @xmath19 is @xmath20 when @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the two spins are aligned , and is @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "if one chooses interactions that are a decreasing function of the distance @xmath23 , then the closer two points are to each other , the more they `` like '' to be in the same state . the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is very similar to other energy functions used in neural systems , where each spin variable represents a @xmath9-state neuron with an excitatory coupling to its neighbors .",
    "in fact , magnetic models have inspired many neural models ( see for example hertz , krogh and palmer 1991 ) .    in order to calculate the thermodynamic average of a physical quantity @xmath24 at a fixed temperature @xmath25",
    ", one has to calculate the sum @xmath26 where the boltzmann factor @xmath27 plays the role of the probability density which gives the statistical weight of each spin configuration @xmath28 in thermal equilibrium and @xmath29 is a normalization constant , @xmath30 .",
    "some of the most important physical quantities @xmath24 for this magnetic system are the order parameter or magnetization and the set of @xmath31 functions , because their thermal average reflect the ordering properties of the model .",
    "the order parameter of the system is @xmath32 , where the magnetization , @xmath33 , associated with a spin configuration @xmath34 is defined ( chen , ferrenberg and landau 1992 ) as @xmath35 with @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of spins with the value @xmath38 ; @xmath39 .",
    "the thermal average of @xmath31 is called the spin ",
    "spin correlation function , @xmath40 which is the probability of the two spins @xmath41 and @xmath42 being aligned .    when the spins are on a lattice and all nearest neighbor couplings are equal , @xmath43 , the potts system is _",
    "such a model exhibits two phases . at high temperatures the system is paramagnetic or disordered ; @xmath44 , indicating that @xmath45 for all statistically significant configurations . in this phase",
    "the correlation function @xmath46 decays to @xmath47 when the distance between points @xmath3 and @xmath4 is large ; this is the probability to find two completely independent potts spins in the same state . at very high temperatures",
    "even neighboring sites have @xmath48 .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the system undergoes a sharp transition to an ordered , ferromagnetic phase ; the magnetization jumps to @xmath49 .",
    "this means that in the physically relevant configurations ( at low temperatures ) _ one _ potts state `` dominates '' and @xmath50 exceeds @xmath51 by a macroscopic number of sites . at very low temperatures @xmath52 and @xmath53 for all pairs @xmath54 .",
    "the variance of the magnetization is related to a relevant thermal quantity , the susceptibility , @xmath55 which also reflects the thermodynamic phases of the system . at low temperatures fluctuations of the magnetizations",
    "are negligible , so the susceptibility @xmath56 is small in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the connection between potts spins and clusters of aligned spins was established by fortuin and kasteleyn ( 1972 ) . in the appendix we present such a relation and the probability distribution of such clusters .",
    "we turn now to _ strongly inhomogeneous _ potts models .",
    "this is the situation when the spins form magnetic `` grains '' , with very strong couplings between neighbors that belong to the same grain , and very weak interactions between all other pairs . at low temperatures such",
    "a system is also ferromagnetic , but as the temperature is raised the system may exhibit an intermediate , _ super - paramagnetic _ phase . in this phase",
    "strongly coupled grains are aligned ( _ i.e. _ are in their respective ferromagnetic phases ) , while there is no relative ordering of different grains .    at the transition temperature from the ferromagnetic to super - paramagnetic phase a pronounced peak of @xmath56",
    "is observed ( blatt , wiseman and domany 1996a ) . in the super - paramagnetic phase fluctuations of the state taken by grains acting as a whole ( _ i.e. _ as giant super - spins ) produce large fluctuations in the magnetization .",
    "as the temperature is further raised , the super - paramagnetic to paramagnetic transition is reached ; each grain disorders and @xmath56 abruptly diminishes by a factor that is roughly the size of the largest cluster .",
    "thus the temperatures where a peak of the susceptibility occurs and the temperatures at which @xmath56 decreases abruptly indicate the range of temperatures in which the system is in its super - paramagnetic phase .    in principle one can have a sequence of several transitions in the super - paramagnetic phase : as the temperature is raised the system may break first into two clusters , each of which breaks into more ( macroscopic ) sub - clusters and so on .",
    "such a hierarchical structure of the magnetic clusters reflects a hierarchical organization of the data into categories and sub - categories .    to gain some analytic insight into the behavior of inhomogeneous potts ferromagnets , we calculated the properties of such a `` granular '' system with a macroscopic number of bonds for each spin . for",
    "such `` infinite range '' models mean field is exact , and we have shown ( wiseman _ et .",
    "_ 1996 , blatt _ et .",
    "1996b ) that in the paramagnetic phase the spin state at each site is independent of any other spin ; _ i.e. _ @xmath57 . + at the paramagnetic / super - paramagnetic transition",
    "the correlation between spins belonging to the same group jumps abruptly to @xmath58 while the correlation between spins belonging to different groups is unchanged .",
    "the ferromagnetic phase is characterized by strong correlations between all spins of the system : @xmath59    there is an important lesson to remember from this : in mean field we see that in the super - paramagnetic phase two spins that belong to the same grain are strongly correlated , whereas for pairs that do not belong to the same grain @xmath46 is small .",
    "as it turns out , this double - peaked distribution of the correlations is _ not an artifact _ of mean field and will be used in our solution of the problem of data clustering .",
    "as we will show below , we use the data points of our clustering problem as sites of an inhomogeneous potts ferromagnet .",
    "presence of clusters in the data gives rise to magnetic grains of the kind described above in the corresponding potts model .",
    "working in the super - paramagnetic phase of the model we use the values of the pair correlation function of the potts spins to decide whether a pair of spins do or do not belong to the same grain and we identify these grains as the clusters of our data .",
    "this is the essence of our method ; details are given below .",
    "the aim of equilibrium statistical mechanics is to evaluate sums such as ( [ eq : taverage ] ) for models with @xmath60 spins . ]",
    "this can be done analytically only for very limited cases .",
    "one resorts therefore to various approximations ( such as mean field ) , or to computer simulations that aim at evaluating thermal averages numerically",
    ".    direct evaluation of sums like ( [ eq : taverage ] ) is impractical , since the number of configurations @xmath61 increases exponentially with the system size @xmath0 .",
    "monte carlo simulations methods ( see binder and heermann 1988 for a introduction ) overcome this problem by generating a characteristic subset of configurations which are used as a statistical sample .",
    "they are based on the notion of _ importance sampling _ , in which a set of spin configurations @xmath62 is generated according to the boltzmann probability distribution ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) .",
    "then , expression ( [ eq : taverage ] ) is reduced to a simple arithmetic average @xmath63 where the number of configurations in the sample , @xmath64 , is much smaller than @xmath65 , the total number of configurations .",
    "the set of @xmath64 states necessary for the implementation of ( [ eq : average ] ) are constructed by means of a markov process in the configuration space of the system .",
    "there are many ways to generate such a markov chain : in this work it turned out to be essential to use the swendsen ",
    "wang ( wang and swendsen 1990 , swendsen , wang and ferrenberg 1992 ) monte carlo algorithm ( sw ) .",
    "the main reason for this choice is that it is perfectly suitable for working in the super - paramagnetic phase : it overturns an aligned cluster in one monte carlo step , whereas algorithms that use standard local moves will take forever to do this .",
    "the first configuration can be chosen at random ( or by setting all @xmath66 ) .",
    "say we already generated @xmath67 configurations of the system , @xmath68 , and we start to generate configuration @xmath69 .",
    "this is the way it is done .",
    "first `` visit '' all pairs of spins @xmath17 that interact , _ i.e. _ have @xmath70 ; the two spins are `` frozen '' together with probability @xmath71 that is , if in our current configuration @xmath72 the two spins are _ in the same state _ , @xmath21 , then sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 are frozen with probability @xmath73 .",
    "having gone over all the interacting pairs , the next step of the algorithm is to identify the sw  clusters of spins . a sw ",
    "cluster contains all spins which have a path of frozen bonds connecting them .",
    "note that according to ( [ eq : swpd ] ) only spins of the same value can be frozen in the same sw  cluster . after this step our @xmath0 sites",
    "are assigned to some number of distinct sw  clusters .",
    "if we think of the @xmath0 sites as vertices of a graph whose edges are the interactions between neighbors @xmath70 , each sw  cluster is a subgraph of vertices connected by frozen bonds .    the final step of the procedure is to generate the new spin configuration @xmath74 .",
    "this is done by drawing , independently for each sw  cluster , randomly a value @xmath75 , which is assigned to all its spins .",
    "this defines one monte carlo step @xmath76 . by iterating this procedure @xmath64 times while calculating at each monte",
    "carlo step the physical quantity @xmath77 the thermodynamic average ( [ eq : average ] ) is obtained .",
    "the physical quantities that we are interested in are the magnetization ( [ eq : mag ] ) and its square value for the calculation of the susceptibility @xmath56 , and the spin  spin correlation function ( [ eq : gij ] ) .",
    "actually , in most simulations a number of the early configurations are discarded , to allow the system to `` forget '' its initial state .",
    "this is not necessary if the number of configurations @xmath64 is not too small ( increasing @xmath64 improves of course the statistical accuracy of the monte carlo measurement ) . measuring autocorrelation times ( gould and tobotchnik 1989 ) provides a way of both deciding on the number of discarded configurations and for checking that the number of configurations @xmath64 generated is sufficiently large .",
    "a less rigorous way is simply plotting the energy as a function of the number of sw steps and verifying that the energy reached a stable regime .    at temperatures where large regions of correlated spins occur , local methods ( such as metropolis ) , which flip one spin at a time ,",
    "become very slow .",
    "the sw procedure overcomes this difficulty by flipping large clusters of aligned spins simultaneously .",
    "hence the sw method exhibits much smaller autocorrelation times than local methods .",
    "the efficiency of the sw method , which is widely used in numerous applications , has been tested in various potts ( billoire 1991 ) and ising ( hennecke 1993 ) models .",
    "[ sec : thealgorithm ] so far we have defined the potts model , the various thermodynamic functions that one measures for it and the ( numerical ) method used to measure these quantities .",
    "we can now turn to the problem for which these concepts will be utilized , _",
    "i.e. _ clustering of data .",
    "for the sake of concreteness assume that our data consists of @xmath0 patterns or measurements @xmath3 , specified by @xmath0 corresponding vectors @xmath78 , embedded in a @xmath6-dimensional metric space .",
    "our method consists of three stages .",
    "the starting point is the specification of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) which governs the system .",
    "next , by measuring the susceptibility @xmath56 and magnetization as function of temperature the different phases of the model are identified .",
    "finally , the correlation of neighboring pairs of spins , @xmath46 , is measured .",
    "this correlation function is then used to partition the spins and the corresponding data points into clusters .",
    "the outline of the three stages and the sub - tasks contained in each can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "construct the physical analog potts - spin problem : 1 .",
    "associate a potts spin variable @xmath79 to each point @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   identify the neighbors of each point @xmath3 according to a selected criterion .",
    "3 .   calculate the interaction @xmath80 between neighboring points @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   locate the super - paramagnetic phase . 1 .   estimate the ( thermal ) average magnetization , @xmath32 , for different temperatures .",
    "2 .   use the susceptibility @xmath56 to identify the super - paramagnetic phase .",
    "3 .   in the super - paramagnetic regime 1 .   measure the spin ",
    "spin correlation , @xmath46 , for all neighboring points @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   construct the data - clusters .    in the following subsections we provide detailed descriptions of the manner in which each of the three stages are to be implemented .",
    "the goal is to specify the hamiltonian of the form ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , that serves as the physical analog of the data points to be clustered .",
    "one has to assign a potts spin to each data point , and introduce short - range interactions between spins that reside on neighboring points .",
    "therefore we have to choose the value of @xmath9 , the number of possible states a potts spin can take , define what is meant by `` neighbor '' points and provide the functional dependence of the interaction strength @xmath80 on the distance between neighboring spins .",
    "we discuss now the possible choices for these attributes of the hamiltonian and their influence on the algorithm s performance .",
    "the most important observation is that _ none _ of them needs fine tuning ; the algorithm performs well provided a reasonable choice is made , and the range of `` reasonable choices '' is very wide .",
    "the number of potts states , @xmath9 , determines mainly the sharpness of the transitions and the temperatures at which they occur .",
    "the higher @xmath9 , the sharper the transition . to ensure that the transition is of first order , in which case the order parameter exhibits a discontinuity ( baxter 1973 , wu 1982 ) ] on the other hand , in order to maintain a given statistical accuracy , it is necessary to perform longer simulations as the value the @xmath9 increases . > from our simulations we conclude that the influence of @xmath9 on the resulting classification is weak .",
    "we used @xmath81 in all the examples presented in this work .",
    "note that the value of @xmath9 does not imply any assumption about the number of clusters present in the data .",
    "the need for identification of the neighbors of a point @xmath78 could be eliminated by letting all pairs @xmath82 of potts spins interact with each other , via a short range interaction @xmath83 which decays sufficiently fast ( say , exponentially or faster ) with the distance between the two data points .",
    "the phases and clustering properties of the model will not be affected strongly by the choice of @xmath84 .",
    "such a model has @xmath85 interactions , which makes its simulation rather expensive for large @xmath0 . for the sake of computational convenience we decided to keep only the interactions of a spin with a limited number of neighbors , and setting all other @xmath80 to zero .",
    "since the data do not form a regular lattice , one has to supply some reasonable definition for `` neighbors '' .",
    "as it turns out , our results are quite insensitive to the particular definition used .",
    "ahuja ( 1982 ) argues for intuitively appealing characteristics of delaunay triangulation over other graphs structures in data clustering .",
    "we use this definition when the patterns are embedded in a low dimensional ( @xmath86 ) space .    for higher dimensions we use the _ mutual neighborhood value _",
    "; we say that @xmath3 and @xmath4 have a mutual neighborhood value @xmath87 , if and only if @xmath3 is one of the k - nearest neighbors of @xmath4 and @xmath4 is one of the k - nearest neighbors of @xmath3 .",
    "we chose @xmath87 such that the interactions connect all data points to one connected graph .",
    "clearly @xmath87 grows with the dimensionality .",
    "we found convenient , in cases of very high dimensionality ( @xmath88 ) , to fix @xmath89 and to superimpose to the edges obtained with this criteria the edges corresponding to the minimal spanning tree associated with the data .",
    "we use this variant only in the examples presented in sections [ sec : one.example ] and [ sec : two.gauss.example ] .      in order to have a model with the physical properties of a strongly inhomogeneous granular magnet , we want strong interaction between spins that correspond to data from a high - density region , and weak interactions between neighbors that are in low - density regions . to this end and in common with other `` local methods '' , we assume that there is a ` local length scale ' @xmath90 , which is defined by the high density regions and is smaller than the typical distance between points in the low density regions .",
    "this @xmath91 is the characteristic scale over which our short - range interactions decay .",
    "we tested various choices but report here only results that were obtained using    @xmath92    we chose the `` local length scale '' , @xmath91 , to be the average of all distances @xmath2 between neighboring pairs @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath93 is the average number of neighbors ; it is twice the number of non vanishing interactions divided by the number of points @xmath0 .",
    "this careful normalization of the interaction strength enables us to estimate the temperature corresponding to the highest super - paramagnetic transition ( see [ sec : super - paramagnetic ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that everything done so far can be easily implemented in the case when instead of providing the @xmath78 for all the data we have an @xmath94 matrix of dissimilarities @xmath2 .",
    "this was tested in experiments for clustering of images where only a measure of the dissimilarity between them was available ( gdalyahu and weinshall 1996 ) .",
    "application of other clustering methods would have necessitated embedding this data in a metric space ; the need for this was eliminated by using spc .",
    "the results obtained by applying the method on the matrix of dissimilarities of these images were excellent ; all points were classified with no error .",
    "the various temperature intervals in which the system self - organizes into different partitions to clusters are identified by measuring the susceptibility @xmath56 as a function of temperature .",
    "we start by summarizing the monte carlo procedure and conclude by providing an estimate of the highest transition temperature to the super - paramagnetic regime . starting from this estimate , one can take increasingly refined temperature scans and calculate the function @xmath95 by monte carlo simulation .",
    "we used the swendsen ",
    "wang method described in section [ sec : swmethod ] ; here we give a step by step summary of the procedure .    1 .",
    "choose the number of iterations @xmath64 to be performed .",
    "2 .   generate the initial configuration by assigning a random value to each spin .",
    "3 .   assign frozen bond between nearest neighbors points @xmath3 and @xmath4 with probability @xmath96 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : pf ] ) ) .",
    "4 .   find the connected subgraphs , the sw ",
    "assign new random values to the spins ( spins that belong to the same sw  cluster are assigned the same value ) .",
    "this is the new configuration of the system .",
    "calculate the value assumed by the physical quantities of interest in the new spin configuration .",
    "go to step 3 , unless the maximal number of iterations @xmath64 , was reached .",
    "calculate the averages ( [ eq : average ] ) .",
    "the super - paramagnetic phase can contain many different sub - phases with different ordering properties .",
    "a typical example can be generated by data with a hierarchical structure , giving rise to different acceptable partitions of the data .",
    "we measure the susceptibility @xmath56 at different temperatures in order to locate these different regimes .",
    "the aim is to identify the temperatures at which the system changes its structure .    as was discussed in section [ sec : model ] , the super - paramagnetic phase is characterized by a non - vanishing susceptibility .",
    "moreover , there are two basic features of @xmath56 in which we are interested .",
    "the first is a peak in the susceptibility , which signals a ferromagnetic to super - paramagnetic transition , at which a large cluster breaks into a few smaller ( but still macroscopic ) clusters .",
    "the second feature is an abrupt decrease of the susceptibility , corresponding to a super - paramagnetic to paramagnetic transition , in which one or more large clusters have melted ( _ i.e. _ broke up into many _ small _",
    "clusters ) .    the location of the super - paramagnetic to paramagnetic transition which occurs at the highest temperature can be roughly estimated by the following considerations .",
    "first we approximate the clusters by an ordered lattice of coordination number @xmath93 and a constant interaction @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the average over all neighbors .",
    "secondly , from the potts model on a square lattice ( wu 1982 ) , we get that this transition should occur roughly at @xmath99 an estimate based on the mean field model yields a very similar value .",
    "once the super - paramagnetic phase and its different sub - phases have been identified , we select _ one temperature _ in each region of interest .",
    "the rational is that each sub - phase characterizes a particular type of partition of the data , with new clusters merging or breaking . on the other hand , as the temperature is varied _ within _ a phase , one expects only shrinking or expansion of the existing clusters , changing only the classification of the points on the boundaries of the clusters .",
    "we use the spin ",
    "spin correlation function @xmath46 , between neighboring sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 , to build the data clusters . in principle",
    "we have to calculate the thermal average ( [ eq : average ] ) of @xmath31 in order to obtain @xmath46 . however , the swendsen ",
    "wang method provides an improved estimator ( niedermayer 1990 ) of the spin ",
    "spin correlation function .",
    "one calculates the two  point connectedness @xmath100 , the probability that sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 belong to the same sw  cluster , which is estimated by the average ( [ eq : average ] ) of the following indicator function @xmath101 @xmath102 is the probability of finding sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the same sw  cluster . then the relation ( fortuin and kasteleyn 1972 )",
    "@xmath103 is used to obtain the correlation function @xmath46 .",
    "clusters are identified in three steps .    1 .",
    "build the clusters `` core '' using a thresholding procedure ; if @xmath104 , a link is set between the neighbor data points @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "the reason is , as was pointed out in section [ sec : model ] , that the distribution of the correlations between two neighboring spins peaks strongly at these two values and is very small between them ( fig [ fig : aros_hist]@xmath106 ) .",

    "[ sec : applications ] the approach presented in this paper has been successfully tested on a variety of data sets .",
    "the six examples we discuss here were chosen with the intention of demonstrating the main features and utility of our algorithm to which we refer from now as the _ super - paramagnetic _ clustering ( spc ) method .",
    "we use both artificial and real data .",
    "comparisons with the performance of other classical ( non - parametric ) methods are also presented .",
    "we refer to different clustering methods by the nomenclature used in the books of jain and dubes ( 1988 ) and fukunaga ( 1990 ) .",
    "the non - parametric algorithms we have chosen belong to four families : @xmath107 hierarchical methods : _ single  link _ and _ complete  link _ ; @xmath108 graph theory based methods : _ zhan s minimal spanning tree _ and fukunaga s _ directed graph method _ ; @xmath109 nearest - neighbor clustering type , based on different proximity measures : the _ mutual neighborhood clustering _ algorithm and _ k - shared neighbors _ ; and @xmath110 density estimation : fukunaga s _ valley seeking method_. these algorithms are of the same kind as the super - paramagnetic method in the sense that only weak assumptions are required about the underlying data structure .",
    "the results from all these methods depend on various parameters in an uncontrolled way ; we always used the _",
    "best _ result that was obtained .",
    "a unifying view of some of these methods in the framework of the present work is presented in the appendix .",
    "the main purpose of this simple example is to illustrate the features of the method discussed in the previous sections , in particular the behavior of the susceptibility and its use for the identification of the two kinds of phase transitions .",

    "since there is a small overlap between the clusters , we consider the bayes solution as the optimal result ; _ i.e. _ points whose distance to the origin is bigger than 2.5 are considered a cluster , points whose radial coordinate lies between 1.5 and 2.5 are assigned to a second cluster and the remaining points define the third cluster .",
    "these optimal clusters consist of 2393 , 1602 and 805 points respectively .    by applying our procedure , and choosing the neighbors according to the mutual neighborhood criterion with @xmath117 we obtain the susceptibility as a function of the temperature as presented in figure [ fig : aros_temp]@xmath118 . the estimated temperature ( [ eq : t_est ] ) corresponding to the super - paramagnetic to paramagnetic transition is 0.075 , which is in a good agreement with the one inferred from figure [ fig : aros_temp]@xmath118 .",
    "figure [ fig : aros ] presents the clusters obtained at @xmath119 .",

    "the remaining 90 points are distributed among 43 clusters of size smaller than 4 .",
    "as can be noted in figure [ fig : aros ] , the small clusters ( less than 4 points ) are located at the boundaries between the main clusters .",
    "one of the most salient features of the spc method is that the spin  spin correlation function , @xmath46 reflects the existence of two categories of neighboring points : neighboring points that belong to the same cluster and those that do not .",
    "this can be observed from figure [ fig : aros_hist]@xmath106 , the two - peaked frequency distribution of the correlation function @xmath46 between neighboring points of figure [ fig : aros ] .",

    "it is instructive to observe the behavior of the size of the clusters as a function of the temperature , presented in figure [ fig : aros_temp]@xmath106 . at low temperatures , as expected , all data points form only one cluster . at the ferromagnetic to super - paramagnetic transition temperature , indicated by a peak in the susceptibility ,",
    "this cluster splits into three .",
    "these essentially remain stable in their composition until the super - paramagnetic to paramagnetic transition temperature is reached , expressed in a sudden decrease of the susceptibility @xmath56 , where the clusters melt .",
    "turning now to the effect of the parameters on the procedure , we found ( wiseman _ et .",
    "1996 ) that the number of potts states @xmath9 affects the sharpness of the transition but the obtained classification is almost the same .",
    "for instance , choosing @xmath121 we found that the three largest clusters contained 2349 , 1569 and 774 data points , while taking @xmath122 we yielded 2354 , 1578 and 782 .",
    "of all the algorithms listed at the beginning of this section , only the single  link and minimal spanning methods were able to give ( at the optimal values of their clustering parameter ) a partition that reflects the underlying distribution of the data .",
    "the best results are summarized in table [ tab : result_aros ] , together with those of the spc method .",

    "manipulation of the data .",
    "each method is characterized by a specific processing of the data .    for almost all methods , including spc , complexity is determined by the first stage because it deserves more computational effort than the data manipulation itself . finding the nearest neighbors is an expensive task , the complexity of branch and bound algorithms ( kamgar - parsi and kanal 1985 ) is of order @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) . since",
    "this operation is _",
    "common for all _ non  parametric clustering methods , any extra computational overhead our algorithm may have over some other non  parametric method must be due to the difference between the costs of the manipulations performed beyond this stage . the second stage , in the spc method , consists of equilibrating a system at each temperature . in general ,",
    "the complexity is of order @xmath0(binder and heermann 1988 , gould and tobochnik 1988 ) .",
    "* scaling with n : * the main reason for choosing an unfrustrated ferromagnetic system , versus to a spin  glass ( where negative interactions are allowed ) , is that ferromagnets reach thermal equilibrium very fast . very efficient",
    "monte carlo algorithms ( wang and swendsen 1990 , wolf 1989 , kandel and domany 1991 ) were developed for these systems , in which the number of sweeps needed for thermal equilibration is small at the temperatures of interest .",
    "the number of operations required for each swendsen  wang monte carlo sweep scales linearly with the number of edges ; _ i.e. _ it is of order @xmath147 ( hoshen and kopelman 1976 ) . in all the examples of this article we used a fixed number of sweeps ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "therefore , the fact that the spc method relies on a stochastic algorithm does not prevent it from being efficient .",
    "* scaling with d : * the equilibration stage does not depend on the dimension of the data , @xmath6 .",
    "in fact it is not necessary to know the dimensionality of the data as long as the distances between neighboring points are known .    since the complexity of the equilibration stage is of order @xmath0 and does not scale with @xmath6 , the complexity of the method is determined by the search for the nearest neighbors .",
    "therefore , we conclude that _ the complexity of our method does not exceed that of the most efficient deterministic non ",
    "parametric algorithms_.    for the sake of concreteness , we present the running times , corresponding to the second stage , on an hp9000 ( series k200 ) machine for two problems : the landsat ( sec . [",
    "sec : landsat.data ] ) and isolet data ( sec .",
    "[ sec : isolet.data ] ) .",
    "the corresponding running times were @xmath149 and @xmath150 minutes per temperature respectively ( 0.12 and 0.15 sec per sweep per temperature ) .",
    "note that there is a good agreement with the discussion presented above ; the ratio of the cpu times is close to the ratio of the corresponding total number of edges ( 18,388 in the landsat and 22,471 in the isolet data set ) , and there is no dependence on the dimensionality .",
    "typical runs involve about 20 temperatures which leads to 40 and 50 minutes of cpu .",
    "this number of temperatures can be significantly reduced by using the monte carlo histogram method ( swendsen 1993 ) where a set of simulations at small number of temperatures suffices to calculate thermodynamic averages for the complete temperature range of interest .",
    "of all the deterministic methods we used , the most efficient one is the minimal spanning tree .",
    "once the tree is built , it requires only 19 and 23 seconds of cpu respectively for each set of clustering parameters .",
    "however , the actual running time is determined by how long one spends searching for the optimal parameters in the ( 3dimensional ) parameter space of the method . the other non  parametric methods presented in this paper were not optimized and therefore comparison of their running times could be misleading .",
    "for instance , we used johnson s algorithm for implementing the single and complete linkage which requires @xmath151 operations for recovering all the hierarchy , but faster versions , based on minimal spanning trees require less operations . running friedman s projection pursuit algorithm , whose",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : landsat_pp ] , required 55 cpu minutes for landsat .",
    "for the case of the isolet data ( where @xmath152 ) the difference was dramatic ; projection pursuit required _ more than a week _ of cpu time , while spc required about one hour .",
    "the reason is that our algorithm does not scale with the dimension of the data @xmath6 , whereas the complexity of projection pursuit increases very fast with @xmath6 .",
    "this work proposes a new approach to non - parametric clustering , based on a physical , magnetic analogy .",
    "the mapping onto the magnetic problem is very simple ; a potts spin is assigned to each data point , and short - range ferromagnetic interactions between spins are introduced .",
    "the strength of these interactions decreases with distance .",
    "the thermodynamic system defined in this way presents different self organizing regimes and the parameter which determines the behavior of the system is the temperature .",
    "as the temperature is varied the system undergoes many phase transitions .",
    "the idea is that each phase reflects a particular data structure related to a particular length scale of the problem .",
    "basically , the clustering obtained at one temperature that belongs to a specific phase should not differ substantially from the partition obtained at another temperature in the same phase . on the other hand",
    "the clustering obtained at two temperatures corresponding to different phases must be significantly different , reflecting different organization of the data .",
    "these ordering properties are reflected in the susceptibility @xmath56 and the spin ",
    "spin correlation function @xmath46 .",
    "the susceptibility turns out to be very useful for signaling the transition between different phases of the system .",
    "the correlation function @xmath46 is used as a similarity index , whose value is not determined only by the distance between sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 , but also by the density of points near and between these sites .",
    "separation of the spin ",
    "spin correlations @xmath46 into strong and weak , as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : aros_hist]@xmath118 , reflects the existence of two categories of collective behavior .",
    "in contrast , as shown in figure [ fig : aros_hist]@xmath106 , the frequency distribution of distances @xmath2 between neighboring points of fig .  [",
    "fig : aros ] does not even hint that a natural cut - off distance , which separates neighboring points into two categories , exists . since the double peaked shape of the correlations distribution persists at all relevant temperatures ,",
    "the separation into strong and weak correlations is a robust property of the proposed potts model .",
    "this procedure is stochastic , since we use a monte carlo procedure to `` measure '' the different properties of the system , but it is completely insensitive to initial conditions .",
    "moreover , the cluster distribution as a function of the temperature is known .",
    "basically , there is a competition between the positive interaction which encourages the spins to be aligned ( the energy , which appears in the exponential of the boltzmann weight , is minimal when all points belong to a single cluster ) and the thermal disorder ( that assigns a `` bonus '' that grows exponentially with the number of uncorrelated spins and , hence , with the number of clusters ) .    we have shown that this method is robust in the presence of noise , and that it is able to recover hierarchical structure of the data without enforcing the presence of clusters .",
    "we have also confirmed that the super ",
    "paramagnetic method is successful in real life problems , where existing methods failed to overcome the difficulties posed by the existence of different density distributions and many characteristic lengths in the data .",
    "finally we wish to re - emphasize the aspect we view as the main advantage of our method : it s _ generic applicability_. it is likely and natural to expect that for just about any underlying distribution of data one will be able to find a particular method , tailor - made to handle the particular distribution , whose performance will be better than that of spc . if however , there is no advance knowledge of this distribution , one can not know which of the existing methods fits best and should be trusted .",
    "spc , on the other hand , will find any `` lumpiness '' ( if it exists ) of the underlying data , without any fine - tuning of its parameters .",
