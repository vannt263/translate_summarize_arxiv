    "the 2-dimensional @xmath0 non - linear @xmath3-model is defined by the action @xmath4 together with the condition @xmath5 for all spacetime points @xmath6 . in this equation @xmath7 is the inverse of the bare coupling constant .",
    "perturbation theory @xmath8 predicts that this model is asymptotically free for @xmath9 .",
    "in particular the exponential correlation length @xmath10 on the lattice must scale as @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the corrections to universal scaling . here",
    "@xmath14 is a non - perturbative constant which for the standard action equals @xcite @xmath15 we define the magnetic susceptibility @xmath16 as the two - point correlation function at zero momentum .",
    "it scales as @xmath17 where again @xmath18 is a non - perturbative constant . from equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 )",
    "we conclude that in @xmath19 the ratio @xmath20 tends to @xmath21 as we approach the continuum limit , @xmath22 .",
    "the corrections to asymptotic scaling @xmath23 depend on @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ".    in a series of papers @xcite another scenario has been put forward for the model defined in ( 1 ) . under reasonable hypothesis",
    "the authors prove that there is no mass gap and that this model must undergo a kosterlitz - thouless - like ( @xmath26 ) phase transition at finite beta , @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that the ratio @xmath28 should be constant as one approaches @xmath27 from below . here",
    "@xmath29 is a critical exponent . for the @xmath30 model",
    "this exponent is @xmath31 . in @xcite",
    "the authors show that the @xmath2 model with the standard action on the lattice and @xmath31 gives a constant for @xmath32 while the data for @xmath33 displays a clear drop .    here",
    "we will show a progress report from an extensive simulation performed on the @xmath1 model with standard action and the @xmath2 model with the tree - level improved symanzik action @xcite .",
    "if the constancy of @xmath32 for the @xmath2 model is a genuine physical effect , then also for the symanzik action we should see such a behaviour .",
    "the full account of our results with better statistics and using more corrections to asymptotic scaling can be found in @xcite .    0.3 cm    0.3 cm",
    "in our simulations we have used the wolff algorithm @xcite for the updatings as well as improved estimators to measure the correlation length and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we have performed several millions of measurements for both quantities and verified the absence of autocorrelations .    to calculate the correlation length we have measured the second moment @xmath34 .",
    "the ratio @xmath35 is less than few parts per mille , so within our statistical errors , we can use the formulae ( 2 - 3 ) .",
    "we have chosen large enough lattice sizes @xmath36 to keep finite - size effects under control .",
    "the ratio @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "we have checked that these effects are few parts per mille .",
    "the largest systematic error comes from the deviation from universal scaling of our data .",
    "these corrections are known up to 4 loops for the standard action and up to 3 loops for the symanzik action @xcite .",
    "we do not show here ( see @xcite ) the data for @xmath33 .",
    "again it is not constant although it displays better scaling than for the standard action @xcite .",
    "the fits for @xmath39 and @xmath40 agree with the prediction ( 3 ) and large-@xmath41 calculations within @xmath42 .        in figure 2",
    "we show the ratio between the non - perturbative constant @xmath44 as computed from our monte carlo data and the prediction ( 3 ) which for the @xmath1 model is @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath19 is correct and asymptotic scaling holds , this ratio should be equal to 1 ( up to @xmath460.1 per mille because we measured the second moment @xmath34 ) .",
    "we show the data as obtained from the 2 , 3 and 4-loop approximation in eq .",
    "the data in the scheme of the energy @xcite at 2 and 3-loop are also shown ( we have used the energy measurements of reference @xcite ) .",
    "all data seem to converge towards the @xmath19 prediction .",
    "a careful analysis of the next coefficients in the @xmath47 expansion suggests that further corrections should have small effects .",
    "the 4-loop data in this figure agree with ( 3 ) within 0.5% .    in figure 3",
    "the data for @xmath32 are shown .",
    "the data are far from constant .",
    "we show the results for two values of @xmath29 : @xmath48 is the upper set of data ( black circles ) and @xmath49 is the lower set ( white circles ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the @xmath19 predictions for @xmath32 assuming @xmath50 ( this is the value obtained from a best fit performed on our data for @xmath16 ; it agrees with large-@xmath41 estimates within 1% ) and the prediction ( 3 ) for @xmath14 .",
    "we see that not only the curves are not constant but also that @xmath19 explains well its non - constancy .    in figure 4",
    "we show the data for @xmath33 .",
    "the upper set of data is the lowest order prediction .",
    "further corrections stabilize the result .",
    "the result clearly converges to a constant .",
    "physical scaling is well reached at the largest correlation lengths .",
    "the corrections to universal scaling converge surprisingly well .",
    "the solid horizontal line is the @xmath19 prediction for the constant by using @xmath50 and the prediction ( 3 ) for the correlation length .",
    "we conclude that our data are in fair agreement with @xmath19 .    in conclusion our data do not support either @xmath26 or @xmath19 for the @xmath2 model but they show clear agreement with @xmath19 for the @xmath1 model . in the @xmath26 scenario one",
    "should explain why @xmath19 works so well for large @xmath41 and large ratios @xmath37 .      9 p. hasenfratz , m. maggiore and f. niedermayer , phys .",
