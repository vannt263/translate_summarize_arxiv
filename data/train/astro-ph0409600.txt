    "the agn contribution may be slightly more significant for these lbgs where the _ chandra _ exposures are only capable of detecting individual objects with luminosities @xmath65  10@xmath57  ( implying many seyfert type agn might not be individually detected at these redshifts ) . in light of these limits we therefore place constraints on the average agn content of these lbgs . the derived rest - frame luminosity upper limits ( 3@xmath4 ) for the - and  are 2.8 and 7.1 @xmath6 10@xmath7 .",
