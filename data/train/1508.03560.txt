    "<S> the realization of an all - optical transistor has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community over the past decades , and still constitutes an active area of research @xcite . however , mandatory arduous criteria have to be fulfilled for its demonstration @xcite , in particular fan - out and cascadability , which are the most difficult to meet . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been shown that such devices , with at their heart the strong light - light interaction arising at an optical event horizon , can be realized @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical analogue of an event horizon occurs when an intense pulse , propagating in a nonlinear waveguide , prevents a weak probe wave traveling at a different velocity from passing through it . </S>",
    "<S> this analogy is both interesting for fundamental science as for practical applications . </S>",

    "<S> as such it can act as a laboratory scale universe , to research effects such as the hawking radiation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , because of the inherent frequency shift that takes place during the interaction between the two waves , the phenomenon has been pointed out as a mechanism for efficiently converting the frequency of a signal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that , the cherenkov radiation , also known as dispersive wave generation in the extensively studied context of supercontinuum generation , constitutes also an efficient way for the transfer of energy far from the pump wavelength @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the first demonstrations of optical event horizons have been realized in optical fibers , by superimposing at the fiber input a weak probe wave together with an intense pulse @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , they have been studied through the collision between pulses , generated in topographic fibers designed for that purpose @xcite . in these experiments , the weak nonlinearity of silica results in the need for pulses with kilowatt peak power and long interaction lengths , clearly preventing the use of optical fibers for the aforementioned integrated low power applications . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear interactions in silicon nanophotonic waveguides , on the contrary , arise for watt - level peak power pulses and for millimeter - scale propagation lengths . </S>",
    "<S> such a platform has thus successfully been used , amongst other , for supercontinuum generation at telecommunication wavelengths in millimeter size optical chips @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , these nanophotonic structures are fully cmos - compatible making them very good candidates for the realization of integrated low power optical functionalities in a , low - cost , high volume fabrication platform . in this letter , we experimentally demonstrate , to the best of our knowledge the first optical event horizon in an integrated photonic nonlinear structure through the reflection of a weak continuous probe wave on an intense pump pulse . </S>",
