    "the concepts of light velocity and speed of information transfer have been debated by many outstanding scientists in the past @xcite .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the ultimate limitation for the speed of information transfer is imposed by the causality principle . according to it",
    ", no information can be transferred at the speed exceeding the speed of light in vacuum @xmath0 .",
    "particularly , for light pulses it means that the motion of the front of a light pulse or the energy transport can not occur at velocities greater than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the phase and group velocities of a light pulse have no such strict limitations .",
    "they may take arbitrary values depending on the material properties and be significantly different from the vacuum speed of light @xcite .",
    "group velocity defines the speed of propagation of the envelope of the pulse @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are refractive and group velocity indices , respectively .",
    "the group velocity can be managed through the dispersion control of the medium @xmath4 . under the normal dispersion conditions",
    "@xmath5 , the group velocity is always less than the phase velocity in the medium , @xmath6 .",
    "it is possible to reach extremely small values of @xmath7 ( called `` slow light '' ) in the case of electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , where steep dispersive profile over a short wavelength range is achieved @xcite . on the contrary , in the case of anomalous dispersion when @xmath8 , the group velocity becomes higher than @xmath0 if @xmath9 moreover , the group velocity changes its sign to a negative value in the case @xmath10 both these conditions correspond to superluminal ( fast ) light propagation regime . in this regime",
    "the pulse traverses the medium at the speed exceeding that in the vacuum .",
    "there have been plenty of remarkable works devoted to the topic of superluminal propagation ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the conditions of anomalous dispersion can be naturally achieved within the medium s absorption band @xcite or inside a tunnel barrier @xcite . although possible , superluminal propagation in this case is hardly observed due to significant loss @xcite or pulse deformations @xcite . to avoid that , some novel approaches have been suggested to use transparent spectral regions for superluminal light @xcite .",
    "particularly , it was demonstrated that in the case of raman gain doublet almost linear anomalous dispersion can be created and therefore distorsionless pulse propagation is possible @xcite .",
    "theoretical considerations predict rather striking and counterintuitive features of superluminal light . among",
    "the most exciting is a propagation in backward direction ( backward light ) or appearance of pulse peak at the exit of medium prior to entering ( negative transit time ) @xcite .",
    "recent experimental observations confirmed both of these predictions @xcite .",
    "although being apparently extraordinary , these phenomena arise , in fact , due to the rephasing of pulse spectral components favored by the anomalous dispersion @xcite .",
    "the associated energy transport always occurs in the forward direction @xcite and its speed is strictly limited by the vacuum speed of light @xcite .",
    "most schemes employ only a single frequency probe pulse to produce superluminal light or demonstrate simultaneous formation of slow and fast light @xcite . the propagation of a single frequency probe beam in an n - type atomic system using double raman gain process",
    "is investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we consider a different concept where superluminal light is achieved for the superposition of probe fields at different frequencies .",
    "formation of such coupled optical fields ( spinor light ) were first analyzed in @xcite . here",
    ", we demonstrate that similar spinor properties can also be achieved in the case of fast light . in the following",
    "we analyze the propagation of two probe fields amplified by raman process pumped by four strong time - independent fields .",
    "such a scheme may be viewed as consisting of two raman gain doublets each providing the amplification for the corresponding spectral components of the probe pulse .",
    "we begin with the well - known raman amplification schemes where single probe and either single or double pump beams and used . based on these results",
    "we derive the propagation equations for the two probe fields in the presence of one raman gain doublet ( two pump frequencies ) and two raman gain doublets ( four pump frequencies ) .",
    "our study demonstrates that the latter scheme supports the uncoupled and coupled states where the coupled state exhibits superluminal propagation .",
    "mathematically the coupled state is represented as a linear superposition of the probe field envelopes which has a definite group velocity ( exceeding c ) . in this scheme",
    "the superluminal propagation is possible only for specific superpositions of the field envelopes , and the individual probe fields do not have definite group velocities .",
    "this is a novel aspect of the wave mixing in raman media which may be interesting for optical signal control or interferometric applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : equations ] we derive the equations of the propagation of the two monochromatic probe fields in the presence of multiple raman resonances .",
    "we use the monochromatic solutions of the field equations further in section [ sec : propagation ] to investigate the superluminal propagation of the two - component wavepackets of light .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our findings and discusses some possible experimental implementations of the superluminal light .",
    "in this section we derive the equations describing the propagation of the probe field(s ) in the raman gain configuration . in order to present the physical situation",
    "more transparently we start with a simplest scheme containing only one probe field and one pump field . after describing the propagation of the probe field in this simplest scheme we consider more complicated schemes with additional pump and probe fields .",

    "[ fig : packet - double]a , the front tail of the wave packet , entering the atomic cloud gets amplified and develops a maximum at the other end of the atomic cloud . in addition , the second probe field is created and also gets amplified , reaching the maximum at the other end of the atomic cloud .",

    "the maximum of the wave packet of the first probe beam is seen to be located at larger value of the coordinate @xmath17 than the maximum of the wave packet propagating in the vacuum , indicating the superluminal group velocity @xmath180 . the maximum of the second probe beam after the atomic cloud is almost at the same location as the maximum of the first probe beam .",
    "we have demonstrated a possibility of producing superluminal light composed of two probe waves characterized by different frequencies and propagating in a medium with two raman gain doublets .",
    "although individual probe fields exhibit raman gain , a strong connection is established between two probe fields due to the resonance between real and virtual states in the coupling scheme .",
    "this leads to the formation of a specific combination ( superposition ) of the probe field envelopes propagating with a definite group velocity determined by the pump power and the detunings .",
    "such a regime corresponds to the pulse propagation with a superluminal velocity and mathematically is described by a particular solution of the wave equation .",
    "it is shown that a peak of the superluminal wavepacket is advanced with respect to the corresponding pulse propagating in the vacuum .",
    "additionally , it is demonstrated that if only one probe field is incident on the medium , both frequencies are produced at the end of the medium as a result of the coupling between the individual probe fields .",
