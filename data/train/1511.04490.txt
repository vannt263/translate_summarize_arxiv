    "although the initial cluster mass function ( icmf ) appears to be universal @xcite , the formation conditions of the highest - mass clusters are still subject to significant debate .",
    "proponents of one school of thought suggest that the formation of the most massive clusters in a given volume or during a specific time period is independent of environment @xcite and , consequently , that the `` size - of - sample '' effect determines the masses of the most massive clusters in a given cluster population ( e.g. , hunter et al . 2003 )",
    ". alternatively , the formation of the most massive clusters may require special physical conditions , such as high ambient pressure or enhanced gas densities , which might indeed be environment - dependent . in the context of the icmf , its possible environmental dependence within a given galaxy could be demonstrated through careful analysis of its relation to galactocentric distance , i.e. , by assessment of the `` star cluster mass  galactocentric radius relation . ''",
    "@xcite modeled the icmfs in actively star - forming spiral and starburst galaxies , adopting a single schechter function , and found that the icmf s chracteristic cut - off mass at the high - mass end is higher for starburst galaxies than for more quiescent spiral galaxies resembling the milky way .",
    "this suggests that this global difference may be owing to the high - pressure environments in starburst galaxies .",
    "pflamm - altenburg et al .",
    "( 2013 ; henceforth pa13 ) explored the apparent cluster mass  galactocentric radius relationship of young star clusters in messier 33 ( m33 , the triangulum galaxy ) based on the data set of @xcite .",
    "they claimed to have ruled out the size - of - sample effect as a mechanism driving massive cluster formation and concluded that very massive star clusters may indeed require special physical conditions to form , and thus that the formation of young star clusters is not a stochastic process .",
    "pa13 s claims appear strong , in the sense that they purport to expose deficiencies apparently perpetrated by the authors of a number of previous analyses ( see also cameron 2013 ) .",
    "however , the scientific strategy employed in these previous studies appears entirely reasonable : namely , their authors compare observational data against a null distribution model and , in the event of observing a reasonable agreement , they decided not to reject the null .",
    "indeed , the quote from past research highlighted by pa13 shows that the earlier researchers were careful to avoid the common logical fallacy of treating non - rejection as support for the null : `` our conclusion [ in support of the random drawing hypothesis ] remains provisional '' ( the text within square brackets is ours ) .",
    "unfortunately , however , the data set used by pa13 is not suitable for the purposes of their analysis ( for evidence , see section [ m33data.sec ] ) .",
    "the validity of their conclusions must thus be revisited .    in this paper , we use observations of young clusters in both messier 51 ( m51 , the whirlpool galaxy ) and messier 83 ( m83 ) to independently test pa13 s conclusions .",
    "we do not only use the ordinary least - squares ( ols ) method employed by these latter authors , but we also introduce `` quantile regression '' ( qr ) as a more suitable and highly robust statistical approach to support our conclusions .",
    "we focus predominantly on the results for m51 , since they are the strongest . in section [ data ] , we explain why we discard all currently available cluster data sets pertaining to @xmath4 myr - old clusters in m33 ( which corresponds to the age range selected by pa13 ) and select the cluster samples in m51 and m83 instead ( but see section [ lmc ] for a brief revisit of the m33 cluster population ) .",
    "we also apply our analysis approach to the lower - mass cluster sample in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . in section [ m51 ] , we apply both methods to m51 and show that any radial dependence is rather weak , a statement for which we present statistically robust evidence . in section [ parameter ] , we discuss the dependence of our results on our adoption of the maximum cluster age , minimum cluster mass , and bin size . we conclude that variation of the lower - mass limit has a significant impact on the results , whereas varying the applicable age range is less important .",
    "we follow up this analysis with similar analyses applied to the m83 as well as to the lmc and m33 cluster populations in sections [ m83 ] and [ lmc ] , respectively . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we briefly summarize the paper and restate our main conclusions .",
    "our analysis relies on having access to statistically significant numbers of young clusters with reliable age and mass estimates .",
    "in addition , we require the host galaxies to exhibit a reasonable symmetry so that radial averaging can be performed appropriately . in the local universe , the most suitable star cluster samples that are readily available for our purpose include those hosted by m33 , m51 , and m83 , as well as the lmc cluster population ( although the latter galaxy is not as symmetrical as its larger spiral counterparts ) .",
    "pa13 based their results for m33 on the @xmath5m - selected data set of @xcite . therefore , as a first step , we attempted to retrieve this database ourselves in order to check their results .",
    "however , we soon learned that @xcite s `` cleaned '' dataset of 648 objects has not been made publicly available , since it consists of an inhomogeneous mixture of object types , including genuine young clusters , but also hii regions and unidentified asymptotic giant branch stars . nevertheless , and despite these concerns ( voiced by the original authors themselves ) , @xcite proceeded to apply statistical analysis tools to both their original , highly contaminated sample of 915 sources and the cleaned data set , referring to the latter as the `` young star cluster sample . '' upon contacting these authors , we learned that the individual cluster ages and masses would be insufficiently accurate for the type of analysis we intended to embark on ( s. sharma 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "they recommended us not to use their data for exploration of the cluster mass  galactocentric radius relation , given that they were well aware of significant , persistent contamination of even their cleaned data set by spurious , non - cluster objects .",
    "however , these concerns were not well communicated in their peer - reviewed article , which led pa13 to chase after what transpired to be a poorly defined , inhomogeneous dataset .",
    "we therefore explored alternative databases containing cluster age and mass estimates for significant samples of m33 clusters .",
    "a subset of the current authors published the current most up - to - date and most carefully defined m33 cluster data set @xcite . the latter sample of star clusters was mainly selected from @xcite , whose database is , in turn , based on observations with the megacam camera mounted on the canada  france",
    " hawaii telescope .",
    "fan & de grijs ( 2014 ) derived photometric and physical parameters for 588 clusters and cluster candidates from archival @xmath6 images from the local group galaxies survey . supplemented by 120 confirmed star clusters from the updated , 2010 version of @xcite , the total number of clusters in their sample reached 708 .",
    "however , although 69% of these clusters and cluster candidates are characterized by ages younger than 2 gyr , few young clusters with ages of @xmath7 yr are included in the final database .",
    "this limitation implies that this database can not be used either to conclusively examine the formation modes of young star clusters following pa13 .",

    ", we have adopted the ages and masses for 940 star clusters and cluster candidates in m83 derived using the @xcite method .",
    "the statistically complete lmc cluster database we adopted was published by @xcite .",
    "these authors used four recent compilations of lmc star cluster parameters to derive a combined catalog of lmc clusters .",
    "their primary data set is that of @xcite , who used data from the magellanic clouds photometric surveys @xcite , combined with isochrone fitting , to derive ages and luminosities for 1193 populous star clusters in a 64 deg@xmath17 area of the lmc .",
    "their second data set is the catalog of @xcite , who used @xmath22 data from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ii ( ogle ii ) @xcite , again combined with isochrone fitting to derive ages of approximately 600 star clusters located in the central parts of the lmc , with ages younger than 1.2 gyr .",

    "many of the ages in these catalogs were derived on the basis of _ hst _ data .",

    "2003 ; mccrady & graham 2007 ; among many others ) .",
    "in addition , there is mounting evidence of the reality of a `` truncation mass '' in cluster mfs which varies among galaxies ( e.g. , gieles et al .",

    "gieles et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and gieles ( 2009 ) reported a truncation mass that is different for spiral and starburst galaxies . for milky way - type spiral galaxies , @xmath26 ( gieles et al .",

    "we focus on the importance of a possible environmental influence at different galactocentric radii _ in the same galaxy_. in this context , different truncation masses in different galaxy types do not rule out stochastic cluster formation in a given galaxy .    in previous research on the reality of truncation masses , the age of the cluster samples used for the analyses usually extended to a few @xmath1 yr .",
    "whether the high - mass end of the cluster mf is affected by a truncation can not always be confirmed convincingly because of the often small numbers of young clusters available .",
    "we can gain statistical insights based on chandar et al.s ( 2010 ) m51 dataset by conducting a monte carlo test to check for the existence , if any , of a truncation mass in the clusters mf ( e.g. , bastian et al . 2012 ) .",

    "we note that chandar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) did not find any evidence for curvature in the mf of their m51 cluster sample .",
    "we can not directly compare our results with theirs , however , since chandar et al .",

    "asuming `` standard '' disruption analysis ( see chandar et al .",
    "2011 ) , our young sample is expected to be negligibly affected by such effects .",
    "we note that the fit result strongly depends on the lower mass limit adopted .",

    "it is clear that the m51 cluster mf is not well approximated by a pure power law .",
    "instead , the dataset requires a truncation at the high - mass end .",

    "we therefore urge the use of caution when interpreting differences of this magnitude .",
    "stochastic effects may also play a role in the construction of the cumulative mfs routinely used in this field : a single deviating cluster may skew the entire distribution , as can be seen by a careful examination of a number of sudden `` jumps '' in the cumulative mfs published to date as well as in this paper .",

    "there are two peaks in the age distribution at @xmath47 myr and @xmath48 myr .",
    "we opted to impose a default maximum age of 10 myr for our initial analysis , following pa13 , which includes 57% of the cluster population .    in fig .",

    "the truncation mass was chosen in the same way as for fig .",
    "[ cf ] : @xmath50 @xmath36 and @xmath51 @xmath36 for the inner and outer regions , respectively .",
    "the masses of the most massive star clusters are well - determined , since they are not strongly affected by stochastic imf sampling effects . however , because of stochastic imf effects , the determination of star cluster masses based on integrated photometry may become highly uncertain for low - mass clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we thus also adopt a minimum cluster mass for our cluster sample selection .",
    "the choice of the lower mass limit is important , because the presence or absence of low - mass star clusters can affect the distribution of the radial bins if the latter are selected to contain constant numbers of clusters .    when fitting the data with a schechter function , we adopt a minimum mass of @xmath52 .",
    "we conclude that reducing the low - mass limit to values much below @xmath39 leads to significant instability in the fits and this thus affects the eventual robustness of the parameters returned by the fits .",
    "application of this selection limit ensures that we retain 17% of the total sample of cluster candidates ( 633 objects ) .",

    "the differently colored solid lines connect the @xmath53 ranked most massive clusters in each bin .",
    "the numbers at the bottom of each bin indicate the number of young clusters contained in the relevant bin .",
    "there is a clear general tendency that the mass of the @xmath54 ranked most massive cluster decreases with increasing galactocentric distance , at least out to @xmath558 kpc .",
    "however , the number of clusters in each bin also decreases , which signals that the observed trend may be confounded by size - of - sample effects .",
    "pa13 suggested that , at first glance , a similar result they obtained for their m33 objects may correspond to the simple , universal probability density distribution function ( pdf ) given by the icmf .",
    "however , they pointed out that they can not rule out a different model where the formation of the most massive star clusters is limited by the local physical conditions , e.g. , by the local gas density ( e.g. , pflamm - altenburg & kroupa 2008 ) .    to further examine the physical relevance of this possibility",
    ", we tried to eliminate the size - of - sample effect by adopting radial bin sizes such that each bin contained the same number of clusters .",
    "if the icmf represents a simple , universal , and environment - independent pdf , then we would not expect to find any radial dependence of the mass of the @xmath54 ranked most massive star cluster .",

    "[ mass_seq_all]b . in each bin",
    ", we identified the @xmath54 ranked most massive young star clusters .",
    "the galactocentric radii assigned to the @xmath54 ranked most massive star clusters are the averages of the radial distances of all star clusters in the relevant bin .",
    "we first used the ols method to fit straight lines to the data , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the slope and intercept , respectively .",
    "our fit results for m51 are rather different from those of pa13 for m33 .",
    "the latter authors found a maximum absolute value of the slope for all clusters of 0.158 ( for all data sets considering the second to the fifth most massive clusters in each bin ) , while for the same relative masses our maximum absolute value for the slope is merely 0.036 .",
    "this difference has important implications for our understanding of the cluster - formation mode in the host galaxy .",
    "if the icmf would be independent of its natal environment , i.e. , if cluster formation were to proceed stochastically , the expected slope for the young massive clusters would be zero , modulo the size - of - sample effect .",

    "this is so , because the approximate @xmath3 confidence intervals encompass a slope of zero for ( almost ) all quantiles .",
    "the simple frequentist @xmath59-value interpretation of the wald test then automatically recommends against rejecting the null hypothesis .",
    "we point out that for a very small number of values of @xmath78 , and depending on the age range considered , the wald test can not be applied directly . from a statistical point of view , this can be understood by realizing that the wald test is , strictly speaking , only applicable to single quantiles , while in this case we run into non - independent multiple hypothesis testing if we are to look over all possible quantiles .",
    "finally , to validate our observational results for m51 , we constructed a mock cluster population characterized by a schechter - type mf . using our simulated cluster population , we explored two conditions , one where the truncation mass does not depend on galactocentric distance and a second where the truncation in the galaxy s inner regions occurs for cluster masses that are 23 times higher than those in the galactic periphery .",
    "we randomly assigned cluster ages from 5 myr ( the youngest cluster age in our observational sample ) to 500 myr , adopting a constant cluster formation rate for the entire intervening period for simplicity .",
    "we used the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ssp models to assign @xmath8-band magnitudes to our sample clusters , a choice driven by the characteristics of the data set of chandar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , whose cluster photometry is ultimately limited by their @xmath8-band observations .",
    "we applied the observational magnitude limit from chandar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and adjusted the number of clusters to reproduce the observational data set as closely as possible given the adopted constraints .",
    "the distributions in the diagnostic age  mass plance of both the observed m51 cluster population and our mock sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ age_mass]a and b.     +    first , we considered the cluster mfs for age ranges younger and older than @xmath31 yr for a universal truncation mass , @xmath84 . for the younger clusters , we adopted a low - mass limit of @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath25 was 50% higher than expected , @xmath85 .",
    "for the older cluster sample , with ages between 100 myr and 500 myr , we adopted a low - mass limit of @xmath34 , which resulted in a derived truncation mass of @xmath86 .",
    "this difference in the derived truncation masses reflects the uncertainties pertaining to our calculations .",
    "the corresponding qr test for this mock data set is similar to what we found previously , resulting in a close - to - zero slope for all quantiles .",
    "second , we considered the case of a truncation mass that depends on galactocentric distance . observationally , a galactocentric - distance dependence has not been established for the m51 cluster population .",
    "therefore , we adopted bastian et al.s ( 2012 ) suggested radial dependence for the m83 clusters for our mock test .",
    "they reported truncation masses of @xmath87 and @xmath88 for , respectively , the inner and outer regions of the galaxy . applying our approach to the entire cluster sample ,",
    "we derive @xmath85 , since the number of clusters in the galaxy s inner regions is much larger than that at larger radii .",
    "however , considering the truncation masses for different radial ranges separately , we derived values consistent with the theoretical input values , within the method s typical uncertainties . thus , if the truncation mass varies systematically by a factor of 2 ( or more ) radially across a given galaxy , we should expect this to show up in our results .",
    "the corresponding qr test also allows us to distinguish between cluster mfs with truncation masses that differ by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "in order to explore how the results depend on the adopted icmf parameters , we varied the maximum age and minimum mass limits , as well as the radial bin size , and re - analyzed the clusters mass  galactocentric radius relationship .",
    "the maximum age limit adopted determines the number of clusters included in our sample ; varying the maximum age limit leads to significantly different sample sizes .",
    "the minimum mass limit adopted determines the distribution of the star clusters in radial bins containing constant cluster numbers . varying the minimum mass limit",
    "will thus change the mass and location of the most massive star cluster in each bin , which will affect our analysis pertaining to stochasticity in the icmf .",
    "bin - size variations also have an immediate effect on the resulting icmf .      if we adopt a maximum age for the young clusters of @xmath89 yr ( 20 myr ) , the resulting m51 cluster sample includes 689 objects . the previously noted tendency that the maximum cluster masses decrease with increasing galactocentric",
    "radius is still obvious .",
    "however , for both the ols ( adopting equal - number radial bins ) and qr analyses , the resulting slopes of the linear fits tend to values close to zero .",
    "the detailed results are included in table [ tbl_m51 ] . the maximum slope for the second or third most massive cluster in each bin ranges from 0.025 to 0.036 ; for the first - ranked cluster in each bin , which we treat separately for stochastic reasons , the maximum slope attained ranges from 0.037 to 0.046 .",

    "figure [ age_seq ] shows the qr result for clusters with maximum ages spanning the range from @xmath90 yr to @xmath91 yr . in all six test conditions ,",
    "the values of the maximum cluster masses appear to be functions of galactocentric radius . for small @xmath78 ,",
    "the slope fluctuates around 0 , while for @xmath92 , the slopes increase .",
    "no matter the extent to which we adjust the age range , the intercept remains the same and the extent to which the slope fluctuates remains stable .",
    "a zero slope is , in all cases , contained within the @xmath2 range .",
    "it is thus clear that varying the upper age limit has a negligible effect on the cluster mass  galactocentric radius relation .",
    "in addition , we point out that the uncertainty becomes rather large for @xmath93 .",

    "+    these results can be understood by considering the distribution of the lowest cluster masses as a function of distance from the center of m51 . for a radial range from the galactic center out to @xmath99 kpc , and adopting bins of equal radial ranges for simplicity ,",
    "the _ numbers _ of clusters with masses @xmath100 do not exhibit any significant radial trend , irrespective of the radial bin size adopted ( for comparison , see table 1 ; although there we included the full range in galactocentric distances covered by our sample clusters ) .",
    "however , if we adopt a lower - mass limit of @xmath101 , an overall downward radial trend becomes discernible , despite the significant fluctuations on interarm scales .",
    "our simulations involving mock clusters lead to a similar result . if the lower - mass limit adopted is sufficiently high enough so that the level of sampling completeness is @xmath102% , the artificial clusters can be fitted adequately with a schechter mf . for lower completeness fractions ,",
