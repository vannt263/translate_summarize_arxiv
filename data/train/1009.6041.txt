    "in a scale larger than several debye lengths , unmagnetized plasmas in the universe have been assumed to be quasi - neutral in charge .",
    "this is because even a small charge imbalance would result in very large electric fields which would cause the very small time scale electrostatic oscillation called plasma oscillation , and the damping or averaging of the oscillation over the mesoscopic time scale restores neutrality ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , if we assume the ideal mhd condition on a magnetized , relativistically moving plasma , the charge density becomes significant , and this charge density is called the goldreich - julian density , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is noted the goldreich - julian density is required so that the electric field induced by the charge density vanishes in the comoving frame of the plasma . in such case , it seems that we can not assume the charge quasi - neutrality .",
    "however , we point out here that the difference between the net charge density of the magnetized plasma @xmath1 and the goldreich - julian density , @xmath2 , plays the same role as the charge in the unmagnetized plasma . in this paper",
    ", we call the difference @xmath3 the  free charge density \" , which induces the electric field observed by the comoving frame of the plasma . in the scale larger than several debye lengths",
    ", the free charge density should tend to vanish because of the same reason for the charge quasi - neutrality of the unmagnetized plasma .",
    "this can be regarded as the generalization of the concept of charge quasi - neutrality to the magnetized , relativistic plasma .",
    "we call this concept  free charge quasi - neutrality \"",
    ". when the magnetic field is so strong and the thin plasma rotates so fast as assumed in a pulsar magnetosphere that the number density of the plasma particles is smaller than the goldreich - julian density divided by the elementary electric charge @xmath4 , the free charge density becomes significant and the electric field observed by the comoving frame of the plasma remains .",
    "the parallel component of this electric field to the magnetic field accelerates plasma particles directly . in the region of the remaining one - direction electric field component along the magnetic field",
    ", plasma is swept by the electric field and the vacuum called  outer gap \" appears @xcite .",
    "even in such vacuum , when plasma enters into it , the plasma is separated into positively and negatively charged fluids and the two fluids move to the opposite directions along the magnetic field to decrease the electric field component .",
    "thus , in a strongly magnetized , relativistic plasma , the free charge tends to be canceled to keep the free charge neutrality . according to the above consideration , in a scale larger than several debye lengths",
    ", it has been assumed that the charged components of plasma move so that the electric field accelerating the charged components decreases so as to restore the free charge quasi - neutrality . here , we report a charge separation instability in an unmagnetized plasma rotating around a black hole , which will induce the free charge density and electric field exponentially . to investigate the charge separation of plasmas around the black holes , we use generalized grmhd equations derived by @xcite .",
    "we present the linear analysis of the charge separation of plasmas near kerr black holes .",
    "we found the well - known plasma oscillation in the stable disk region outside of an innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around a black hole . on the other hand , in a circularly rotating plasma inside of the isco",
    ", we found an instability of the charge separation .",
    "the charge separation instability does not happen in the stable disk region outside of the isco .",
    "furthermore , even in the unstable disk inside of the isco , the growth rate of the charge separation is smaller than that of the disk instability .",
    "however , when the plasma density is much lower than the critical density ( the very low plasma density case ) , the growth rates of the two instabilities become comparable and the charge separation instability becomes apparent .",

    "however , we emphasize again that when the plasma density is much less than the critical density , @xmath149 , the charge separation instability may be apparent as the charged disk falling into the black hole .",
    "the mechanism of the charge separation instability is explained by the following schematic picture .",
    "consider that the accretion disk is composed of two disks of positively charged particles ( + disk ) and of negatively charged particles (  disk ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "both of the purely charged disks ( @xmath150 disks ) are unstable in the region @xmath151 .",
    "however , even in the unstable region , when one disk ( @xmath150 disk ) falls and the other disk ( @xmath152 disk ) shifts outward , the electric field is induced and tends to suppress the charge separation .",
    "when the electric field is strong enough , it causes plasma oscillation . on the other hand , when the electric field can not become so strong ( in the case of @xmath149 ) , the suppression is not strong ( effective ) enough and the charged disks separate each other increasingly so that the charge separation is induced exponentially . in the outer region of the isco , @xmath153 , the plasma oscillation is always induced by the charge separation because of the stability of the @xmath150 disks . using this intuitive picture of the charge separation instability , we suggest that the charge separation instability with small wave number @xmath44 is also possible in the unstable disk around the rotating black hole , when the plasma oscillation frequency @xmath154 is small enough and the plasma density is sufficiently small .",
    "this picture also suggests that in a magnetized plasma disk , the similar instability of charge separation would be caused to break the free charge quasi - neutrality when the purely charged disk is gravitationally unstable and the plasma density is low enough .",
    "this charge separation grows exponentially until the nonlinear effects begin to suppress the instability .",
    "for example , the disk charged by the charge separation instability falls into the black hole and charges the black hole .",
    "the electric field of the charged black hole will suppress the fall of the charged disk and induce the fall of the oppositely charged plasma around the black hole .",
    "the charge separation instability may also happen in the pulsar magnetosphere when the radius of the isco is larger than the central star radius .",
    "however , when the magnetic field is extremely strong , the free charge due to the charge separation instability would not be induced because the magnetic field suppresses the gravitational instability of the disk .",
    "plasma dynamics of the pulsar magnetosphere outside of the relativistic star were investigated with the schwarzschild metric by henriksen and rayburn @xcite .",
    "they discussed the net charge separation and the instability , while they did not perform the linear analysis of the charge separation in bulk plasma .",
    "they considered the large - scale net charge separation within the free charge quasi - neutrality and the charge separation instability produced by the current driven plasma turbulence which leads charge fluctuation on small scales less than the debye length .    here",

    ", we estimate the influence of the electric field of the charged black hole to the ambient plasma in the following case .",
    "we assume that the one - component charged fluid with the height @xmath178 , the inner radius @xmath179 , the outer radius @xmath180 , and the density @xmath181 falls due to the charge separation instability and is swallowed by the black hole .",

    ", we have the simple expression , @xmath189 where the ratio does not depend on the black hole mass , @xmath155 .",
    "this suggests that the small disk with the scale of the schwarzschild radius supplies so much charge to the black hole through the charge separation instability within short time scale of the instability that the charged black hole influences the plasma dynamics around it . this electric field will suppress the further charging of the black hole",
    "it is true that the charge separation instability is caused only in the unstable disk region .",
    "however , the current induced by the instability may reach the stable disk region because of the inertia of the current .",
    "the current supplies the net charge in the stable disk around the black hole .",
    "thus , the charge separation due to the instability may induce a distinctive drastic phenomena in the plasma of the stable disk regions around black holes , while the net charge may be canceled by the charge supply from the outer disk . for example , the gravitational magnetic reconnection can be induced by the charge separation @xcite .",
    "if the charge separation is significant , it also causes a strong electric field .",
