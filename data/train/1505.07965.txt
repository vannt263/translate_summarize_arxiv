    "colloidal suspensions are composed of large and often highly charged macromolecules ( macro - ions or colloids ) , immersed in an electrolyte ( `` salt '' ) solution of mobile , positively or negatively charged micro - ions .",
    "these micro - ions move in a solvent that is in a first approximation regarded as a medium of uniform dielectric permittivity .",
    "the system as a whole is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium at some inverse temperature @xmath2 .    in the 1920s ,",
    "debye and hckel ( dh ) @xcite proposed a linearized mean - field description of the bulk thermodynamics of coulomb fluids which is adequate in the high - temperature region @xmath3 .",
    "some years earlier , gouy @xcite and chapman @xcite had established the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) mean - field treatment of the electric double layer , which served as a basis for the dvlo theory of colloidal interactions @xcite .",
    "a simple framework for studying the thermodynamics of colloidal suspensions at finite density is provided by the cell model @xcite .",
    "if however the concentration of colloids in the system is very low , in the first approximation one can ignore their mutual interaction and consider the so - called infinite dilution limit .",
    "colloids can be then studied as isolated mesoscopic objects of a given shape and bare charge , situated in a charged solution",
    ". this will be the viewpoint adopted here and for simplicity , we will address the homogeneous dielectric case with the dielectric permittivity of the colloid @xmath4 equal to that of the solvent @xmath5 ( no electrostatic image charges ) .",
    "the concept of ( effective ) charge renormalization , introduced by alexander et al @xcite in the context of the pb cell model is simple to define in the infinite dilution limit : the renormalized / effective charge follows from the far - potential induced in the electrolyte @xcite . at large distances from a charged body with bare charge @xmath6 , the electrostatic potential takes the same form as that obtained within the linearized dh theory , with a modified prefactor @xmath7 which embodies the nonlinear effects of the pb theory , or of an approach which goes beyond the mean - field description . within the nonlinear pb approach , @xmath8 for low values of @xmath9 while @xmath7 saturates to a finite constant",
    "when @xmath10 .",
    "in general , one expects that @xmath11 as a consequence of the nonlinear screening effect of the electric double layer around a colloid . for a monovalent 1:1 electrolyte",
    "the effective charge is indeed always smaller than the bare one .",
    "this is no longer true for asymmetric electrolytes which exhibit an overshooting effect @xcite : there exists a ( rather small ) interval of @xmath6 where @xmath12 .",
    "although the definition of an effective charge is unambiguous within the nonlinear pb theory , it is not clear whether the far - potential behaves like the dh one in an exact description which goes beyond the mean - field assumption .",
    "the two - dimensional symmetric coulomb gas of pointlike @xmath13 charges , interacting via the logarithmic coulomb potential , is integrable in the whole interval of couplings @xmath14 where oppositely charged couples of charges do not collapse @xcite .",
    "the concept of renormalized charge has been shown to be valid for a charged conductor wall @xcite , a pointlike guest charge @xcite and for a guest charge with a small hard core @xcite which permits one to go beyond the stability threshold .",
    "it is interesting that for a guest charge with a small hard core at a finite temperature @xcite , @xmath7 turns out to be a non - monotonous function of @xmath6 ; the same phenomenon was observed also in monte - carlo @xcite and molecular - dynamics @xcite simulations of the salt - free cell model .",
    "moreover , as @xmath6 goes to infinity , the effective charge does not saturate to a value but oscillates between two extreme ( minimal and maximal ) values .    in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the definition of the effective charge within the nonlinear pb theory . for a charged infinite plane",
    ", one can obtain explicit results for the symmetric 1:1 and asymmetric 1:2 and 2:1 electrolytes @xcite .",
    "for other asymmetric two - component electrolytes , the solution can be constructed implicitly , see a short review @xcite .",
    "realistic macro - ions are usually modeled as curved objects , namely cylinders or spheres of a given radius @xmath1 . for such systems ,",
    "the functional relation between @xmath7 and @xmath6 depends , besides the salt content , also on the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the inverse debye ( correlation ) length of micro - particles .",
    "two limiting cases are studied :    * if @xmath17 , the analysis is difficult due to the counter - ion evaporation phenomenon , that may in the no salt limit be complete for spheres , or partial for cylinders , see @xcite and @xcite . yet , the cylindrical pb equation is painlev integrable for the symmetric 1:1 and asymmetric 2:1 and 1:2 electrolytes .",
    "this enables one to construct systematically the non - analytical @xmath15-expansion of the effective charge @xcite . *",
    "if @xmath18 , the colloid radius is large compared to the debye length @xmath19 and the plane geometry is a good reference for finding @xmath20 expansions of the effective charge .",
    "shkel et al @xcite constructed an asymptotic large - distance expansion of cylindrical and spherical pb equations for the symmetric 1:1 electrolyte . using the method of multiple scales",

    "@xcite is laborious and in practice does not allow to go to high orders of the @xmath20 expansions .",
    "however , inspecting the structure of these results suggests some re - summation can be performed , which in turn strongly points to a novel re - parametrization of the electric potential .",
    "pushing further this idea , it appears that the algebra is conducive to a much easier derivation of the @xmath20 expansions . for the cylindrical geometry",
    "especially , the formulation ends up with a representation of each expansion order in terms of finite polynomials , which enables one to construct expansions to arbitrary high orders . as concerns the spherical geometry",
    ", we were able to go one order beyond the results of @xcite ; as a by product of the analysis , a divergence problem for higher - order terms indicates the change of the analytic behaviour of the expansion .",
    "for both cylindrical and spherical geometries and the three types of electrolytes ( 1:1 , 1:2 and 2:1 ) , the obtained analytical results for the coefficients of the @xmath20 series expansions are tested against numerical resolutions .",
