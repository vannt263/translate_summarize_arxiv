    "we present the first exclusive observation of @xmath0 hadronic  @xmath1 + jets events . with these events ,",
    "we measure the @xmath4 production cross section in @xmath7 collisions at @xmath8 with the cdf detector @xcite at the tevatron at fermilab , as well as the first direct measurement of the top quark mass in @xmath1 + jets events .",
    "these measurements provide important tests of lepton universality and probe the top quark properties in a relatively unexplored channel which may be sensitive to new physics .",
    "additionally , they are good examples of physics measurements performed with @xmath1 leptons in high jet multiplicity environments .",
    "this analysis uses a dataset with a total integrated luminosity of 2.2 @xmath9 collected with the cdf detector between february 2002 and august 2007 .",
    "the data is selected using a multi - jet trigger which requires at least four jets each with a calorimeter cluster with transverse energy ( @xmath10 , where transverse refers to being perpendicular to the beamline ) @xmath11 and a total sum @xmath10 of all reconstructed jets @xmath12 . to these events ,",
    "we apply selection criteria which require 4 jets with @xmath13 , missing @xmath10 ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 , and a hadronically decaying @xmath1 lepton with @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , one of the 4 jets must be identified as coming from a @xmath5 quark ( @xmath5-tagging ) @xcite .",
    "since our signal process gives a single @xmath1 lepton , we veto any event with an identified electron or muon .",
    "hadronically decaying @xmath1 s appear as narrow jets with an odd number of charged tracks and low @xmath17 multiplicity .",
    "they are selected using similar requirements as described in @xcite , except we require both 1 and 3 prong @xmath1 s to have visible @xmath10 of at least @xmath18 and a visible mass less than @xmath19 .",
    "we also place no explicit requirement on the transverse energy of the @xmath17 s in the isolation region , but we do require that calorimeter energy in the isolation region be less than 10% of the @xmath1 energy .",
    "the dominant background for this analysis is high jet multiplicity qcd events with one of the jets faking the signature of a @xmath1 lepton . to further reduce the qcd multijets background , we developed an artificial neural network ( nn ) to distinguish between true @xmath20 + jets events and qcd multijets events",
    "first , we create a sample of qcd multijets from data by selecting events with a @xmath1 with no track isolation requirement .",
    "the nn is trained to distinguish between these selected qcd multijets events and @xmath4 events generated with the mc generator @xcite where the @xmath1 decay is handled by the package @xcite to properly account for the @xmath1 polarization .",
    "we use 8 variables to train the nn : @xmath14 , lead jet e@xmath21 , sum e@xmath21 of the jets and @xmath1 lepton , sum e@xmath21 of the two lowest e@xmath21 jets and the @xmath1 lepton , sum e@xmath21 of the two highest e@xmath21 jets , transverse momentum of the @xmath6 which decays to a @xmath1 lepton , average @xmath22-moment of all jets not identified as coming from a @xmath5 quark , and the lowest ratio of dijet mass to trijet mass for any possible triplet of jets . after training the nn , we find it provides good separation between qcd multijets and @xmath4 events as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnoutput ] , and we find the optimal signal significance is achieved by removing all events which return a nn output below 0.85 . before the nn requirement , we select 162 @xmath1 + jets events which are largely qcd multijets events as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tagfit ] . after",
    "the nn selection is applied , we find 41 events of which we expect roughly 18 qcd multijets events and 18 @xmath23 events . from mc studies",
    ", we estimate 76% of the selected @xmath23 events are hadronic @xmath24 decays .",
    "the majority of the remaining @xmath23 events come from all - hadronic @xmath23 decays with less than 7% contamination from @xmath25 + jets .     in red ) and background ( qcd multijets in blue ) events .",
    "the nn is trained with @xmath23 events given an output value of 1 and background events given an output value of 0 .",
    "we select events with a nn output value @xmath26.[fig : nnoutput],width=226 ]      due to the difficulty in mc modeling of qcd multijets events , @xmath5 quark tagging algorithms , and the production of heavy flavor quarks in association with @xmath6 bosons , we use a data - driven approach to estimate the background contribution similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "first , we calculate the contributions from electroweak background processes which have a minimal contribution to the final total ( diboson , single top quark production , and @xmath27 + jets events ) , as well as the @xmath23 signal contribution , by using the theoretical cross section for each process along with the acceptance from mc simulation and the total integrated luminosity .    with these contributions known",
    ", we evaluate the contributions for qcd multijets and @xmath6 + jets events by fitting the shape of the nn output distribution for each component ( including the fixed contributions already calculated ) to the data before the nn selection and @xmath5-tagging requirements are applied .",
    "we fit these distributions using a binned poisson likelihood . from this fit",
    ", we evaluate the percentage of the data events above the 0.85 nn output value which are coming from qcd multijets .",
    "any remaining events are assumed to come from @xmath6 + jets processes .",
    "we next apply @xmath5-tagging efficiencies to sources except the data - based qcd multijet events to estimate the resulting contribution from each source after the @xmath5-tagging requirement is applied .",
    "the @xmath6 + jets events are divided up into contributions from @xmath6 + light flavor and @xmath6 + heavy flavor ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) .",
    "we then fit the resulting nn output shapes along with the qcd multijet nn output shape to the data after the @xmath5-tagging requirement is applied to calculate the contribution from qcd multijet events .",
    "the fits before and after the @xmath5-tagging requirement are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tagfit ] .",

    "we expect roughly 39 events compared to the observed 41 with nearly half of the events coming from @xmath20 + jets and half from qcd multijet production .",
    "the uncertainties given are a combination of statistical uncertainties and the selection efficiency uncertainties .",
    "the qcd multijet uncertainty includes the systematic uncertainty on the fraction of qcd multijet events.[tab : tau_m2 ] [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     having evaluated all uncertainties , we measure @xmath32 to be @xmath33 which agrees with the most recent tevatron combination of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath1 + jets decay channel to identify @xmath4 events as well as measure the top quark properties with 2.2 @xmath9 of data .",
    "we find the @xmath4 pair production cross section to be @xmath35 pb .",
    "we also measure the top quark mass in this decay channel for the first time ever and find it to be @xmath36 .",
    "we find the measurements to be consistent with the current cdf combination top pair production cross section of @xmath37 pb @xcite and the summer 2011 tevatron top quark mass combination of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the values we measure with @xmath1 leptons agree with current measurements , therefore , we find no evidence against lepton universality . additionally , the success of these measurements demonstrates that we can do complicated analyses with @xmath1 leptons in high jet multiplicity environments at hadron colliders .",
