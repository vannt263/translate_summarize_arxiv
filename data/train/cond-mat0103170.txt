    "<S> we study the finite - size effects in some scaling systems , and show that the finite number of agents @xmath0 leads to a cut - off in the upper value of the pareto law for the relative individual wealth . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath1 of the pareto law obtained in stochastic multiplicative market models is crucially affected by the fact that @xmath0 is always finite in real systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that any finite value of @xmath0 leads to properties which can differ crucially from the naive theoretical results obtained by assuming an infinite @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , finite @xmath0 may cause in the absence of an appropriate social policy extreme wealth inequality @xmath2 and market instability .    </S>",
    "<S> power law ; multiplicative process ; cut - off ; finite - size effect .    </S>",
    "<S> power laws appear ubiquitously as probability distributions in a wide range of systems . </S>",
    "<S> they have been studied for a long time both theoretically and practically . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the relative number of people having a wealth between @xmath3 and @xmath4 has been found already @xmath5 years ago to fulfill the pareto power law @xcite : @xmath6 from the very beginning it turned out that especially for small values of exponents ( @xmath7 ) which imply slow decay of the distribution at infinity , this distribution form presents quite a few surprises , paradoxes and unexpected properties . in particular , the limit of an infinite number of individuals @xmath8 is not defined for many of the measurements .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we study some dynamical processes where the naive theoretical results obtained for @xmath9 fail for any arbitrarily large finite @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main sources of this non - uniform limit is the upper cut - off effect which any finite value of @xmath0 implies . </S>",
    "<S> we mean by `` the upper cut - off effect '' the following simple fact : suppose the wealth of individuals in a particular system is distributed by a power law with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> then , for any value @xmath3 , there is a finite probability that an individual @xmath10 possesses a wealth @xmath11 larger than @xmath3 . for a finite system , </S>",
    "<S> if one defines by @xmath12 the relative wealth of the individual @xmath10 , with @xmath13 the total wealth , one has obviously probability @xmath14 that any @xmath15 will take a value larger than @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , obviously , the distribution of the relative wealth @xmath15 can not be a power law and it has an upper cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , when this cut - off is taken into account the very value of the exponent @xmath1 ( in the region of @xmath15 values in which the power law does apply ) is affected .    </S>",
    "<S> this discontinuous behavior of the limit @xmath8 is important in practical applications where the samples are always finite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it means that certain theoretical results obtained within the assumption of @xmath17 are invalid . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of finite - size effects in stock market models has been investigated @xcite , especially for the price changes . here </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate mainly on the effect of finite - size cut - off on the power - law of the wealth distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we highlight the qualitative difference between the behaviors of the finite @xmath0 system and the theoretical results for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider first the example of a pure multiplicative stochastic process that leads for @xmath18 to the log - normal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the log - normal distribution implies an effective exponent which at asymptotically large values diverges to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this is compared with the actual behavior for any finite @xmath0 which converges towards @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we study the multiplicative stochastic processes with a lower bound , which lead theoretically for @xmath18 to power laws with @xmath21 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast it with the finite @xmath0 systems where values @xmath2 can take place .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular in financial systems , our results imply that in the absence of a social security policy which takes appropriately into account the effects of a finite population @xmath0 , the pareto exponent @xmath1 may fall to values @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn means the concentration of an @xmath22 fraction of the total wealth in the hands of just a few individuals even if the market size is asymptotically large . </S>",
    "<S> we show that beyond the moral and social problems which such an extreme unequal distribution of wealth implies , @xmath2 also means that the financial markets themselves become unstable as their fluctuations become macroscopic .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with a multiplicative random walk process involving @xmath0 independent variables ( or individual wealths in financial system ) @xmath11 , @xmath23 , which undergo each the updating process : @xmath24 where the random numbers @xmath25 are independent but extracted with the same time - fixed and @xmath10-independent probability distribution @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> according to the generalized central limit theorem , if the distribution @xmath26 is characterized by the mean @xmath27 and variance @xmath28 the asymptotic time dependence of the @xmath3 probability distribution is : @xmath29 in particular , it was pointed out that this log - normal distribution can be regarded as an effective power law ( [ eq - power ] ) with exponent @xmath1 changing with @xmath3 @xcite . for small @xmath3 , @xmath30 which corresponds to @xmath31 distribution , while in the large @xmath3 tail </S>",
    "<S> , this distribution ( [ eq - lognormal ] ) behaves as a power law with exponent diverging to infinity @xcite .    to see this , </S>",
    "<S> let us put the distribution in the form @xcite : @xmath32 where the effective @xmath3-dependent power exponent @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 then formally @xmath35 , i.e. , the tail of the distribution has an effective power law with exponent infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> we will show however that this tail is completely irrelevant for any finite system at large enough times : there is simply no variable @xmath3 with such large value within the system . </S>",
    "<S> as the time goes on and the distribution spreads over larger intervals , the initial number of variables @xmath0 becomes too sparse to sample the far away tail . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in reality , the behavior of the theoretical @xmath18 distribution at asymptotic times is quite different for any system containing a finite number @xmath0 of variables .    </S>",
    "<S> an upper bound for the values which the @xmath11 s can take is given by the total wealth in the system , and obviously none of the individuals can have a larger value , that is , @xmath36 with the total wealth @xmath13 defined as @xmath37 thus , from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - alpha ] ) and ( [ eq - cutoff ] ) we have @xmath38    in the limit @xmath9 , @xmath39 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - wtot ] ) is proportional to the average value @xmath40 and for the multiplicative system ( [ eq - wi ] ) it is @xcite @xmath41 however , the result is very different for finite @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> there , the observed mean wealth @xmath42 is much less than the @xmath18 average @xmath43 , since the average values ( and other statistical properties ) of the multiplicative system are determined by the extreme events and the most extreme events can appear only for large enough @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the mean @xmath39 approaches the value of @xmath43 ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - avew ] ) ) when the system size @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 a constant and decided by the details of the multiplicative process ) , which at asymptotic times is far beyond the size of simulations or real ( e.g. , financial ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for finite - size multiplicative systems the total wealth @xmath46 at large enough times mainly depends on the largest value among @xmath11 @xcite , that is , @xmath47 the value of @xmath48 can be obtained analytically for @xmath49 , ( i.e. , for finite @xmath0 and asymptotic times ) in the case in which the random numbers @xmath50 are extracted from a gaussian distribution of zero mean @xmath51 and finite variance @xmath52 @xcite : @xmath53    substituting eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - wmax ] ) and ( [ eq - wmaxg ] ) into ( [ eq - bound ] ) one obtains that @xmath54 thus , eq .  ( [ eq - alphab ] ) implies that for finite size @xmath0 and large enough time @xmath55 , the effective @xmath1 value is far from being infinite even for the large @xmath3 tail . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the exponent @xmath1 decreases as time takes larger and larger values .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulations of the system for various times and @xmath0 values confirm this prediction . </S>",
    "<S> one way to analyze the simulation data and to validate the power law is to use a zipf plot @xcite . in order to make a zipf plot one re - labels the various values of the individual wealths @xmath11 existing in the system at a given time in descending order as follows . </S>",
    "<S> one denotes by @xmath56 the wealth @xmath48 of the richest individual , @xmath57 the wealth of the wealthiest among the remaining individuals , and so on , until one reaches the poorest individual whose wealth is denoted by @xmath58 . with these notations , the power law eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - power ] ) leads to the zipf law : @xmath59 thus , in the log - log plot of @xmath60 ( the zipf plot ) the power law ( [ eq - power ] ) corresponds to a straight line with slope @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> visually , steeper slopes represent smaller exponents @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , the @xmath31 distribution ( corresponding to @xmath62 ) leads to an infinite slope in the zipf plot , and conversely , a flat and almost horizontal zipf plot corresponds to @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - lngt ] and [ fig - lngn ] exhibit the zipf plots for the multiplicative system ( [ eq - wi ] ) with @xmath50 distributed by a gaussian with @xmath63 and @xmath64 . as expected from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - alphab ] ) , all the slopes for finite @xmath0 are larger than @xmath14 , corresponding to power laws with effective exponents @xmath1 much smaller than the theoretical @xmath9 prediction @xmath65 . in fact , in contrast to the @xmath9 result , as time increases @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - lngt ] where the slope @xmath61 becomes steeper with increasing time . in accordance with the same eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - alphab ] ) the zipf plot ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - lngn ] ) gives steeper and steeper slopes ( @xmath66 ) as @xmath0 decreases from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> the same results can be obtained for different distributions of the random factor @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - ln ] shows the zipf plots for @xmath50 uniformly distributing in a range @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the above phenomena caused by the upper cut - off ( [ eq - cutoff ] ) are still present .    </S>",
    "<S> this upper cut - off effect holds for any finite value of @xmath0 for large enough times , and is not limited to the log - normal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a similar argument insures that other slow - decaying distributions have sharp truncations and/or departures from the @xmath70 results . in order to uncover these effects </S>",
    "<S> one has to use appropriate plots for each quantity . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the upper cut - off does not affect the straight line shape of the zipf plot for a system obeying the power - law distribution ( [ eq - power ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this cut - off is made explicit by first normalizing each variable ( wealth ) to the total wealth and averaging over many realizations to obtain an estimation of the probability pareto distribution @xmath71 . by plotting then @xmath72 against @xmath73 , obviously one can not expect a straight line since at least for @xmath74 one has @xmath75 . in the actual plots , indeed a dramatic bent is shown in the graph when the variable @xmath3 approaches the total capital @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we encounter an unexpected subtle effect related with the special properties of the power laws . </S>",
    "<S> the effect originates in the fact that the density of probability @xmath76 has to be @xmath14 at @xmath77 due to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - cutoff ] ) , in spite of the naive @xmath70 expectation @xcite that the distribution eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - power ] ) will continue to infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> a particular model where these observations are relevant is the multiplicative stochastic model with lower bound introduced in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the process ( [ eq - wi ] ) is supplemented by a lower bound : @xmath78 ( i.e. , whenever according to ( [ eq - wi ] ) @xmath79 becomes less than @xmath80 , the actual updated value @xmath79 is taken as @xmath80 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a lower bound represents in the model the economic effects of subsidies , securities , and services .    for infinite @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , this process leads to the precise power law with the exponent @xmath81 in reality , that is , for finite @xmath0 , one obtains a different result @xcite : for @xmath82 , the exponent is @xmath83 while for @xmath84 the relation ( [ eq - alpha1 ] ) is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> ( the large @xmath11 scaling properties of this system are representative of a larger class of systems @xcite of the form : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an arbitrary function @xcite . )    </S>",
    "<S> numerical results probing the properties of this multiplicative stochastic model with lower bound are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - zipf ] , [ fig - wi1 ] and [ fig - wi2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( we used here the realistic asynchronous dynamics , i.e. , different wealths are updated in successive random order : at each time @xmath55 only one wealth is randomly chosen for updating . </S>",
    "<S> however , similar results are obtained for the synchronous dynamics ) . in the simulations the random factor @xmath87 is distributed with uniform probability between @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    as explained above , while the zipf plots of the individual wealth configurations do not show any deviation from the precise power - law behavior ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - zipf ] ) , the pareto distribution of the normalized @xmath90 , obtained by averaging over many runs , shows a sharp bent to @xmath91 for @xmath92 ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - wi1 ] and [ fig - wi2 ] ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - wi1 ] , we have @xmath93 and then the formula ( [ eq - alpha1 ] ) holds especially for large @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when there is no significant social security policy , that is , @xmath94 in the lower bound eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - lower ] ) , one obtains the low values of exponent @xmath95 , as predicted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - alpha2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - wi2 ] .    for the power - law distribution ( [ eq - power ] ) , the ratio between the largest wealth and the total wealth is @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when @xmath95 , the richest person has an @xmath22 fraction of the total wealth even if the market size is asymptotically large . </S>",
    "<S> this extreme financial inequality is questionable from moral point of view and unacceptable from social point of view @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , here we make the observation that such an inequality is equally dangerous even from the narrower point of view of financial stability . to understand the implications of the @xmath95 on the market fluctuations , recall @xcite that the market index fluctuations are expected to also obey ( modulo the cut - off tails ) a power - law behavior with an exponent close to or larger than that of the individual wealth pareto distribution . </S>",
    "<S> telegraphically , the argument in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite consisted of the following steps :    * the market index is identified with the total wealth @xmath13 in the market , i.e. with the sum of the individual invested wealths @xmath11 ; * the market fluctuations over a certain time period are therefore the sum of the variations of the individual wealths @xmath11 , with @xmath10 randomly selected for updating during that period ; * the individual variations of the @xmath11 s are , according to eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - wi ] ) , stochastically proportional to the @xmath11 s themselves , which are distributed by a power law with exponent @xmath1 ; * thus , the market fluctuations are the sums of steps with sizes distributed by a power law with exponent @xmath1 .    therefore , a wealth distribution with @xmath95 implies market fluctuations distributed by a power law with a little larger but still small effective exponent ( modulo the truncation effects , the details of which are outside the scope of the present paper and were studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they fit well the experimentally observed cross - over to larger power - law exponents and to exponential - type behavior @xcite for extremely large fluctuations . ) in turn this small exponent implies the emergence with finite probability of macroscopically large market fluctuations , which means that the financial markets in a society with a pareto wealth distribution of @xmath2 are open to a significant risk of macroscopic market crashes . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion is that a responsible social policy which insures the smallest wealth @xmath97 is not just a humane duty but also a vital interest of the capital markets .    </S>",
    "<S> this finite - size cut - off effect also occurs in systems other than the multiplicative ones , in particular for the critical phenomena . for the two- or three - dimensional percolation system , which has been well studied and understood @xcite , the number @xmath98 of clusters containing @xmath99 sites each decays for large @xmath99 as a power law @xmath100 in an infinite lattice and at the percolation threshold @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the fisher exponent @xmath102 is @xmath103 for two dimensions ( @xmath104 ) , while for three dimensions ( @xmath105 ) it is @xmath106 . in a finite lattice , the cut - off behavior similar to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - cutoff ] ) exists , that is , no cluster can be larger than the whole lattice and then the cluster radius @xmath107 in a @xmath108-dimensional lattice of linear size @xmath109 , where at @xmath101 this radius behaves as @xmath110 , with @xmath111 for @xmath104 or @xmath112 for @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the size distributions for these largest clusters have been investigated @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , things are more complicated for the cut - off effect of the finite systems . for the critical phenomena like the percolation , little </S>",
    "<S> is known about the extremely rare clusters at @xmath101 with size @xmath99 between @xmath113 and @xmath114 which are outside the scaling region . as in the case of the multiplicative processes such as eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - wi])-([eq - lower ] ) , more work is needed in order to investigate e.g. the margin of the wealth value obeying the power - law scaling as well as its dependence on the system size .    </S>",
    "<S> returning to the financial applications , our results caution against the use of the @xmath18 limit in estimating the parameters of the distributions for wealth and market fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , while for @xmath70 some random multiplicative mean field models seem to insure @xmath21 @xcite , in reality for any finite number of individuals @xmath0 , in the absence of an appropriate social policy which insures the smallest wealth @xmath115 one is led to a very unbalanced wealth distribution @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> for such a wealth distribution , a large fraction of the total wealth remains in the hands of just a few richest individuals . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn is bound to lead not only to social unrest but also to unbearable financial markets fluctuations . </S>"
