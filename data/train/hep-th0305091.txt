    "two quantities @xmath147 and @xmath162 seem to carry the information of @xmath7 matrices ; the elements of @xmath148 agree with the expression described in @xcite in terms of @xmath7 matrices , under identification @xmath163 in the limit @xmath157 .",
    "the matrix @xmath147 also encodes the information of the mass spectra .",
    "when taking the inverse fourier transformation , the nearest zero to the real axis , @xmath164 of @xmath153 , is relevant in the  scaling \" limit as @xmath165 tends to be infinity .",
    "applying the poisson s summation formula , we found a most dominant term , @xmath166 for example , where @xmath167 .",
    "note that the relation @xmath168 is consistent with the scaling dimension @xmath169 .",
    "one similarly verifies that all other drive terms also take the form @xmath170 and their mass ratio agree with those in @xcite .",

    "once @xmath19 is fixed by tba , we can also evaluate the free energy from @xmath172 it is readily shown that a  fluctuation \" part of the free energy @xmath173 is proportional to @xmath174 , which is the desired expression .",
    "we treat another example corresponding to @xmath6 perturbation theory , the simplest and most well studied case , the ising model off critical temperature , @xmath4 .",
    "the model is described by a free fermion , thus is rather trivial in a sense . in view of functional relations , however , it is not trivial to derive the simplest @xmath19 system @xmath176 ( in the present normalization of @xmath98 ) , from @xmath99 in ( [ dvf ] ) which consists of 3 terms .",
    "this model is actually one of the first examples , which require a more fundamental object than @xmath99 , a box , which seems to correspond to a fundamental breather @xmath177 .",
    "we define @xmath178 which has a property common to @xmath99 namely , it is pole - free due to the bethe ansatz equation .",
    "more importantly , we have functional relations , @xmath179    the first equalities are directly verified by comparing both sides in forms of the ratio of @xmath180 functions . the seconds are consequences of the duality .",
    "one then reaches a desired relation ( [ yy1 ] ) after proper renormalizations . the first equation , ( [ isingt1 ] ) seems to suggest @xmath181 is related to the kink in the theory ; the bound state of kink produces a breather .    in general @xmath182",
    "even case , we find that @xmath181 plays the most fundamental role , which will be a topic of a separate publication .",
    "it is a nice exercise to recover from ( [ isingt1 ] ) and ( [ yy1 ] ) , the free fermion free energy , in the scaling limit .",
    "we shall remark the analytic property , supported by numerics , that @xmath181 being analytic and nonzero in the strip @xmath183 $ ] , for that purpose .",
    "in this report , we demonstrate explicitly that tba for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , conjectured by dorey et al , are realized in the scaling limit of lattice models .",
    "the crucial idea is to introduce fusion transfer matrices associated to skew young tableaux and to investigate the functional relations among them .",
    "the proofs of functional relations are rather combinatorial and lengthy , thus omitted due to the lack of space .",
    "they will be supplemented in the subsequent paper which discusses the tba behind the dilute @xmath2 models , @xmath23 general @xcite .",
    "there are still many open problems .",
    "the explicit identification of string solutions would be definitely one of the most important .",
