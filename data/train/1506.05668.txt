    "in 1970 , vitaly efimov considered three identical bosons with short - range two - body interactions  @xcite . in the limit that each of the three pairs is just short of supporting a two - body bound state ,",
    "efimov predicted that the three - body system would support infinitely many three - body states with geometrically spaced binding energies .",
    "moreover , as the two - body attraction is increased , the most weakly - bound three - body states become unbound .",
    "efimov s counterintuitive predictions are based on ordinary non - relativistic quantum mechanics and have stimulated concerted theoretical and experimental efforts  @xcite .",
    "the geometric spacing of the three - body bound states in the regime where the two - body system is just short of supporting a shallow two - body bound state ( i.e. , when the absolute value of the two - body @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 is infinitely large ) can be understood as a consequence of a discrete scale invariance or an infrared limit cycle  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the changes of the three - body energies with increasing and decreasing two - body attraction ( i.e. , for finite positive and finite negative @xmath0-wave scattering lengths ) are also captured by the universal theory .",
    "intriguingly , efimov s scenario is independent of the details of the underlying two - body interactions",
    ". it should apply if the @xmath0-wave scattering length is much larger than the other two - body length scales such as the effective range .",
    "provided this is the case , the three - body system is , to a good approximation , governed by just two parameters , the @xmath0-wave scattering length and a three - body parameter . over the past few years , much effort has been devoted to understanding what determines the value of the three - body parameter for three - body systems that interact through pairwise two - body van der waals potentials with long - range @xmath2 tail  @xcite .",
    "while it was long thought that the three - body parameter could take any value , it is now believed that two - body van der waals universality plays a crucial role in understanding the three - body parameter for atomic three - body systems  @xcite .",
    "the universal zero - range theory does not make predictions about the value of the three - body parameter .",
    "using @xmath3 , where @xmath3 denotes the binding momentum of the @xmath4th efimov trimer with infinitely large @xmath0-wave scattering length ( there exists an infinity of efimov states and @xmath5 increases with decreasing binding ) , to `` anchor '' the three - body spectrum , the three - body energy @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) of the @xmath5th efimov trimer is determined by the radial law  @xcite @xmath8^{n - n^ * } \\exp(\\delta(\\xi)/s_0 ) \\frac{\\hbar^2 ( \\bar{\\kappa}^{(n^*)})^2}{m},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is equal to @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a universal function whose parameterization is given in ref .",

    "the angle @xmath14 goes from @xmath15 to @xmath16 : @xmath15 corresponds to the points where the energy of the trimer is equal to that of the dimer , @xmath17 corresponds to infinitely large @xmath0-wave scattering lengths , and @xmath16 corresponds to the points where the trimer energy is equal to zero .",
    "equation  ( [ eq_zrtheory ] ) implies the following relations  @xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19 and  @xcite @xmath20 here , @xmath21 denotes the @xmath0-wave scattering length at which the @xmath5th efimov trimer becomes unbound , i.e. , the scattering length corresponding to @xmath22 . since @xmath21 and @xmath23 are related through eq .",
    "( [ eq_zrproduct ] ) , the radial law can be rewritten in terms of @xmath24 instead of @xmath3 ; in fact , the radial universal zero - range theory law can be rewritten in infinitely many ways since all three - body energies are related to each other .",
    "the efimov spectrum of three - body systems interacting through two - body van der waals potentials starts at a finite negative energy since the short - range two - body repulsion , which is a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle , provides a `` natural regularization '' or energy cutoff . labeling the most strongly - bound efimov trimer by @xmath25  @xcite ( note that there is a certain ambiguity in deciding where the ladder of efimov states starts for systems with finite - range interactions ;",

    "we believe that two - body single - channel van der waals potentials that support many two - body @xmath0-wave bound states would yield a value for @xmath32 that is close to the @xmath32 value reported in table  [ tab_shallow ] for shallow two - body van der waals potentials ; checking this explicitly is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "if this assertion is correct , then the experimentally determined value of @xmath32 for cs can not be fully explained by the single - channel van der waals theory .",
