    "however , the definition of @xmath0 is dependent on its representation space and different choices for the basis of hilbert space will cause distinct values of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because we only use the amplitude of the wavefunction to construct @xmath0 , and then all entanglements included in phase@xcite is lost .",
    "+ to obtain the `` total entanglement '' , we calculate the schmidt number@xcite and compare it with the entanglement ratio @xmath0 in the following section .",
    "mathematically , for a bipartite system in pure state , the entanglement of an unfactorable wavefunction can be completely characterized by the schmidt number , which is denoted by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 are eigenvalues of the integral equation @xcite : @xmath87 the density matrix for photon is defined as : @xmath88 where , note that we have taken away the time ",
    "dependent phase in the density matrix since it does not contribute to entanglement .",
    "although we do it with the photon , schmidt number can be equally obtained through the atomic density matrix , and the eigenfunctions of atom @xmath89 $ ] can be related to those of photon through : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xmath93 form complete orthonormal sets for the photon and atom respectively . with these discrete modes , the unfactorable wavefunction can be expanded into a sum of factored products uniquely : @xmath94 then , the schmidt number @xmath1 , which is an estimation of the number of modes that are `` important '' in making up the expansion of eq . ( 18 ) , serves as a quantitive measurement of entanglement@xcite@xcite .",
    "note @xmath1 is independent from representation since all @xmath95 keep the same in different representations , thus can be seen as a quantity of the full entanglement information ( both amplitude and phase entanglement ) kept in the collective wavefunction . +     and the amplitude entanglement degree @xmath0 in dependence on @xmath68 with @xmath57 .",
    "spots are numerical results for @xmath1 whereas solid line is plotted for @xmath0 .",
    "the inset shows them as functions of @xmath67 with @xmath68 fixed , lines from bottom to top are depicted as : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , respectively .",
    ", height=188 ]    since eq .",
    "( 15 ) is not analytically solvable , we use a discrete eigenvalue equation to approximate the integral equation .",
    "up to a reliable precision , we use @xmath102 matrices to carry out the diagonalization , and collect some of the results in fig .",
    "4 , where we also compare schmidt number @xmath1 with the amplitude entanglement ratio @xmath0 .",
    "+ from the numerical results , we find that , similar to the ratio @xmath0 , @xmath1 rises linearly with parameter @xmath67 and will increase rapidly when the linewidth of incident photon is squeezed narrower to the atomic linewidth @xmath42 , i.e , @xmath103 ; secondly , when @xmath68 is fixed , the slope of @xmath104 is always larger than that of @xmath105 , which means that more entanglement information will transfer to phase when @xmath67 becomes larger , and this phenomena will become more evident when @xmath68 is reduced , e.g. , when @xmath106 , @xmath107 whereas @xmath108 , which indicates that more than half of the entanglement information will be unavailable by momentum dispersion observation when @xmath67 goes large on this condition .",
    "+ another phenomena is notable , when @xmath56 , i.e. , the linewidth of the incident photon is not squeezed and can be prepared directly by spontaneous emission from the same atom , we find @xmath109 @xmath110 whereas in the case of spontaneous emission@xcite @xmath111 @xmath112 .",
    "this difference indicates that , although in both cases , entanglement is generated from momentum conservation in the process of photon emission with atomic recoil , the absorption of the incident photon will add some entanglement due to its coherent pumping effect . as @xmath1 is linear with @xmath3 ( or @xmath67 ) , we define the `` entanglement pumping coefficient '' as : @xmath113 since the constant term in @xmath114 plays a minor role when entanglement is large .",
    "the defined coefficient @xmath115 shows the times that entanglement is increased by the coherent pumping of an incident photon .",
    "as it is independent on the atomic parameter , it reflects the ability of entanglement of the photon separately .",
    "we collect some numerical results in fig . 5 and fit it with @xmath116 within @xmath117 ,",
    "from which , one sees that @xmath115 increases rapidly when @xmath68 diminishes , which also implies that , if the incident photon is prepared monochromatically on its limit condition , i.e. , @xmath118 , the scattered photon will be highly entangled to the recoiled atom .",
    "+ we plot the amplitude of the first three schmidt modes for the photon with @xmath57 and @xmath56 in fig .",
    "we find that their number of peaks in momentum space is proportional to the schmidt mode index , but the separations of different peaks are more distinct than in the case of spontaneous emission@xcite . +",
    "as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "the solid line is its fitted function @xmath119.,height=151 ]    to consider the transmitted photon , we make the observation angle @xmath120 , and yield the collective wavefunction from eq .",
    "( 10 ) : @xmath121 one can see that , in eq . (",
    "19 ) , the first term describes that the two particles are free of interaction and keep their initial factorable wave form ; the second term reflects the entanglement .",
    "usually , the second term is much smaller than the first one since @xmath122 , but one can enlarge it by choosing some special physical system , such as the artificial atom with low excited level and high coupling to its resonant modes . however , this improvement can add few entanglement between the transmitted photon and recoiled atom , because interference between the two terms in eq .",
    "( 19 ) will weaken the correlation of the two particles at a great deal . to make it clear , we show the contour and density plots for the probability amplitude of @xmath123 in fig .",
    "2 on an artificial condition @xmath124 , and yield @xmath125 in this situation . + the eigenfunctions of transmitted photon for the first three modes with @xmath59 and @xmath56 are collected in fig . 6 , from which one can see that , due to the interference , the corresponding modes of the transmitted photon exhibit one peak less than that of the scattered photon .",

    "we analyze the physically fundamental interaction between a single photon and a free artificial atom in vacuum . with a few physical approximations , the general solution of the photon  atom wave function is obtained , from which , it is found that the initially uncorrelated particles will evolve to be entangled due to momentum conservation in scattering .",
    "to evaluate the entanglement in the scattering , firstly , we use an experimentally accessible parameter @xmath0 , which denotes the ratio between momentum variance in single  particle and in coincidence observations , and yield its simple dependences on the two physical control parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 ; secondly , we use standard schmidt decomposition to reveal the full entanglement information and find out its varying tendency similar to that of @xmath0 , which indicates that high entanglement can be achieved by either squeezing the linewidth of the incident photon or broadening the scale of atomic wave packet . furthermore , compared with spontaneous emission , we defined a parameter @xmath115 to evaluate the entanglement enhancement due to the coherent pumping effect of the resonant incident photon . in the end",
