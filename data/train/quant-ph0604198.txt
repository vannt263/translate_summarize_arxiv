    "unlike classical cryptography which often relies on unproven assumptions on computational complexity to ensure secrecy , quantum cryptography , or more precisely , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , provides proven unconditional security against any attacks allowed by quantum mechanics . to date , most of these security proofs handle protocols on a case by case basis . in particular , two well - known qkd protocols , the bennett - brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) protocol @xcite and the scarani - acin - ribordy - gisin 2004 ( sarg04 ) protocol @xcite , have a collection of independent proofs despite sharing a variety of properties .",
    "for example , both schemes are _ prepare - and - measure _ protocols , implying that implementation does not require a quantum computer but rather is within the ability of modern optical technology .",
    "both protocols utilize qubits and use the same four quantum states to encode information .",
    "thus , the quantum transmission part is the same .",
    "they differ only in the classical discussion part ( in particular , the basis reconciliation step ) .",
    "the two protocols organize the quantum states into bases in different manners ; however , both exhibit discrete rotational symmetry among the states .",
    "the fundamental difference between them arises from the fact that the pairs of basis states in sarg04 are not orthogonal as they are in bb84 .",
    "this non - orthogonality makes the sarg04 protocol more resilient to multiple - photon attacks and thus plays a practical role .    in this letter",
    ", we wish to generalize the bb84 and sarg04 protocols to allow an arbitrary number of bases ( @xmath0 ) and arbitrary angle ( @xmath1 ) between basis pairs .",
    "our motivation is to better understand the role of discrete symmetry in qkd by studying the relation between these parameters and the resulting protocol security . the previous work of koashi @xcite has made strides in the subject .",
    "nonetheless , we improve on his results in several areas .",
    "firstly , we derive a closed form formula for the relationship between bit and phase error rates , thus allowing us to place tighter bounds on the quantum key generation rate .",
    "secondly , our results hold for any value of @xmath1 , while koashi requires @xmath1 to take on discrete values related to @xmath0 .",
    "lastly , rather surprisingly , our closed form expression is independent of the number of the bases @xmath0 for @xmath2 . note that our result does not subsume koashi s , since he studied the relations between bit and phase error rates for an arbitrary number of photons sent out by alice while we consider only the single - photon case .",
    "we now describe the generalized qkd protocol . in this protocol",
    ", alice prepares qubit states .",
    "experimentally , these may be realized by polarization states . in the sarg04 protocol",
    ", alice chooses from one of four pairs of basis states .",
    "we generalized the protocol , so that now she chooses from a set of @xmath3 pairs .",
    "hence each of the @xmath0 basis pairs has a @xmath4 chance of being selected .",
    "moreover , for each of the @xmath0 basis pairs , the two states are separated by an angle @xmath1 @xmath5 0 ( see fig .  [ fig : mbasis ] ) .",
    "thus , when @xmath6 , the collection of states is identical to bb84 ( here , we adopt a symmetrized version of bb84 with four bases instead of two ) , while @xmath7 reduces to the sarg04 protocol . note that our generalized protocol does not include the six - state protocol @xcite since the states in our generalized protocol lie on a plane in the bloch sphere whereas the six states in the six - state protocol do not .    in our notation",
    "it is convenient to introduce the rotation operator about the y - axis @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . here",
    ", the coefficient of @xmath10 as opposed to @xmath11 in the exponential arises from the fact that we are considering a spin-@xmath12 qubit , such as a photon , embedded in a 3d hilbert space .",
    "thus , the x - basis kets satisfy : @xmath13 .",
    "we now denote the set of states that alice may choose from by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are x - basis eigenkets .",
    "thus , when @xmath17 , the states @xmath18 become z - basis eigenkets .",
    "also , by construction , the set of basis states @xmath18 are simply rotated copies of each other , equally spaced at angular intervals of @xmath19 , about the upper half unit circle . due to the rigid rotation of the basis states ,",
    "each pair of states satisfies the inner product @xmath20 , for @xmath21 .",
    "we outline the generalized prepare - and - measure protocol as follows :    1 : :    alice prepares n qubits . for each qubit",
    ", she randomly chooses one of    the @xmath0 bases pairs .",
    "we denote her choice of basis by the    set of numbers : @xmath22 , where    @xmath23 . for each qubit",
    ", she also picks a random    bit @xmath24 .",
    "2 : :    for the @xmath25th state , alice chooses the @xmath26    basis and prepares either the state @xmath27    if @xmath28 or the state @xmath29    if @xmath30 . 3 : :    alice sends her states over a quantum channel to bob .",
    "4 : :    bob receives @xmath31 possibly noisy qubits . for each state",
    "@xmath25 , bob chooses a random number @xmath32    representing the @xmath33th basis . for each @xmath32",
    ",    he then randomly chooses one of two projection measurements ( one    projects onto the orthogonal states    @xmath34    and the other onto    @xmath35 )    to measure the incoming state . when the measurement outcome is    @xmath36 or    @xmath37 , he concludes    that the incoming state is @xmath38 or    @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "when either of the    other two outcomes occurs , he declares an inconclusive result for this    state . 5 : :    alice and bob discuss over classical channels their preparation and    measurement basis .",
    "they discard all @xmath25 states where    @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , the pair discard all states    where bob records an inconclusive measurement .",
    "hence , on average , alice and bob retain @xmath41 bits , where @xmath42 is the probability of bob s measurement is conclusive . when the quantum channel is perfect ( i.e. , no eve ) , @xmath43 .",
    "for some special cases such as the sarg04 protocol , the reduction by a factor of @xmath0 can be avoided ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) .",
    "this is because the two projection measurements for the different @xmath32 s are the same for sarg04 . in other words , there are only two distinct measurements and are independent of @xmath32 , but the interpretation of the measurement outcomes is dependent on @xmath32 .",
    "additionally , by the same token , the reduction by a factor of @xmath45 in @xmath42 may not be needed in some protocols such as the bb84 protocol .",
    "this is because the two projection measurements for each @xmath32 are the same for bb84 .    due to the possibility of a noisy quantum channel or the presence of eve",
    ", the sequence of @xmath46 bits shared by alice and bob will not be identical but rather have some fraction , @xmath47 , of errors .",
    "also , eve may have some knowledge of the @xmath46 bits .",
    "the remaining steps in the protocol describe the process of converting the insecure sequence of @xmath46 bits into a shorter sequence of @xmath48 secure bits .",
    "these steps are analogous to those in bb84 :    6 : :    alice and bob discuss and randomly choose a fraction @xmath49    of their @xmath46 bits .",
    "they reveal the values of their    bits and estimate the error rate . 7 : :    in a large sampling , their estimated error rate will asymptotically    approach the true error rate @xmath47 . 8",
    ": :    depending on the value of @xmath47 , the pair either abort the    protocol or perform error correction and privacy amplification to    distill a secure key of length    @xmath50 .    without loss of generality and for simplicity ,",
    "the states lost in the channel are excluded in the description above and also in the following derivations . to facilitate the study , we first convert our prepare - and - measure protocol into an equivalent entanglement - distillation - protocol ( edp)-based qkd protocol ( see @xcite ) . by the equivalence of the two protocol formulations ,",
    "any results we derive with one , such as the bound on the secret key generation rate , apply directly to the other .    to appreciate the connection between edp and qkd",
    ", we observe that if alice and bob shared @xmath31 pure epr states of the form @xmath51 , then individual measurements in the basis @xmath52 , @xmath53 will produce @xmath31 random , identical results .",
    "that is , alice and bob share an identical string of random states composed of either @xmath52 or @xmath53 . after associating logical values with the states , alice and bob",
    "will share a secure sequence of @xmath31 random digits , exactly what is required for a key .    in an edp , alice and bob share @xmath31 entangled bipartite quantum states .",
    "these states , are either mixed or pure .",
    "the task of generating an encryption key therefore reduces to the problem of converting the entangled states into pure epr pairs by using only local operations and classical communications ( loccs ) .",
    "once the couple obtains pure epr pairs , they may simply measure their states and obtain a secure key as outlined above .    to convert our generalized protocol into an edp - based protocol",
    ", we must determine a suitable mathematical representation for the bipartite quantum states , @xmath54 , shared by alice and bob .",
    "we observe that in the prepare - and - measure scheme , if alice chooses the @xmath55th basis and randomly prepares either the state @xmath56 or @xmath57 , then mathematically her preparation process is identical to the construction of the joint quantum state @xmath58 , followed by a z - eigenbasis measurement in the @xmath59 quantum subspace .",
    "the mathematical representation for @xmath54 is outlined as follows . in the subsequent notation",
    "we denote latexmath:[$\\textbf{p}\\big (     alice s preparation : :    : alice prepares her states by choosing , with equal probability , among    the different @xmath0 bases .",
    "hence in the edp she will prepare    the ensemble @xmath61 , for    @xmath62 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath55 , alice    constructs the state :    @xmath63 noisy channel : :    : alice sends the second qubit across a noisy channel to bob . to model    the noisy channel we introduce a general quantum operator    @xmath64 , which maps density matrices to density    matrices .",
    "such an operator accounts for all possible quantum processes    including , unitary evolution in an extended hilbert space and    generalized povm measurements made by an eavesdropper . in general",
    ",    @xmath65 has a representation by a finite    collection of operators @xmath66 such that each    @xmath67 is positive ,    @xmath68 , and    @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the noisy quantum channel transforms the    density matrix according to : @xmath70 bob s filtering : :    : lastly , when bob receives his quantum states , he randomly chooses    one of the @xmath0 bases to perform his measurements . for each    choice",
    ", he further selects one of two projection measurements to    measure the quantum state . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , this measurement    process can be modeled by a filtration operation    @xmath71 , followed by a regular orthogonal    measurement in the z - eigenbasis . here ,",
    "the kraus filtration operator    for the pair of states @xmath72 and    @xmath73 is :    @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding filtration operator for a general pair of states    @xmath57 and @xmath75 is    the rotated filter :    @xmath76 .",
    "the    kraus filtration operator only transforms on the right side to ensure    the invariance of    @xmath77 .    since alice and",
    "bob only retain states in which they choose the same    preparation and measurement basis , bob s operation in the edp    corresponds to simply    @xmath76 .",
    "hence we have : @xmath78    to sum over the @xmath0 bases in equation ( [ ab_densitymatrix ] ) , we expand out @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , @xmath81 and complex coefficients @xmath82 for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath87 are representations of the identity or pauli matrices .",
    "thus , @xmath88 anti - commutes with @xmath89 while @xmath90 commutes with both @xmath89 and @xmath91 .",
    "it is also simple to prove from first principles that for @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "therefore we obtain : @xmath94\\\\                  & = & \\widehat{f}_0 \\sum_{j } \\bigg[\\widehat{u}_j|\\psi_0\\rangle_{ab } \\langle\\psi_0|\\widehat{u}_j^\\dag + \\widehat{v}_j   \\phi   \\widehat{v}_j^\\dag                  \\bigg]\\widehat{f}_0^\\dag.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 . here",
    "the last equality holds only for @xmath2 while in the case of @xmath96 , @xmath97 .    what is the effect of discrete averaging on @xmath54",
    "firstly , we observe that an arbitrary continuous rotation through an angle @xmath98 by alice and bob transforms @xmath99 . moreover , a close inspection shows that for @xmath2 , @xmath100 commutes with @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the process of discrete averaging results in the invariance of @xmath100 and @xmath54 to continuous rotations .",
    "the origin of the symmetry derives from the mathematical form of @xmath100 . by construction",
    "@xmath100 commutes with bob s discrete rotations of @xmath102 and therefore has the same eigenspace as the discrete rotation operators . for @xmath2 , discrete and continuous rotations share the same eigenspace",
    ". therefore @xmath100 must commute with all continuous rotations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath96 , the rotation operators under consideration are proportional to the identity .",
    "hence , in this case , @xmath100 does not have the same eigenspace as the continuous rotation group and so the general @xmath96 protocol is not invariant under simultaneous rotations by alice and bob .",
    "we now proceed with the security analysis .",
    "the quantum bit error rate , @xmath47 , is the physical error rate experienced by alice and bob during qkd .",
    "such an error occurs when alice prepares a logical @xmath103 or @xmath10 , while bob conclusively measures @xmath10 or @xmath103 .",
    "the bit error only gives a partial indication of the properties of a quantum channel .",
    "one can imagine an eavesdropper or noisy channel altering the relative phase of a qubit without effecting bit error rate statistics . just as @xmath47 was introduced as the error obtained from alice and bob s preparation and measurement in the z - basis",
    ", we may introduce the phase error as the resulting error rate if the couple prepared and measured in the x - basis . to study bit and phase errors , we introduce the bell basis :",
    "@xmath104 the bell diagonal elements of alice and bob s bipartite density matrix represent the probabilities of a quantum channel inducing various errors on their shared entangled state .",
    "that is , we may think of alice and bob originally sharing an entangled epr pair while the effect of an eavesdropper or noisy channel is to induce bit errors @xmath105 and vice versa , or phase errors @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the diagonal elements of the bipartite density matrix have the following form : @xmath107    here , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 represent the probabilities of a bit flip , phase flip and both bit and phase flip error . from the diagonal elements , we may extract closed form expressions for the errors , since @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we may insert matrix representations and calculate the diagonal elements of @xmath54 explicitly .",
    "[ as stated earlier , we always assume that @xmath113 . ]",
    "interestingly , in the case when @xmath2 , eq .",
    "( [ ab_densitymatrix ] ) simplifies significantly because of spherical averaging , resulting in expressions that are independent of @xmath0 ; on the other hand , in the case when @xmath96 , spherical averaging does not simplify eq .",
    "( [ ab_densitymatrix ] ) .      for the @xmath114 case",
    ", we have @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a normalization constant ( see appendix  [ app - caldiagonal ] for detail ) .",
    "thus , the relation between the bit and phase error rate is @xmath117    we remark that this relation as well as the diagonal elements of the marginal density matrix , eqs .",
    "( 10)-(13 ) , hold independent of the loss in the channel , and also independent of the number of bases @xmath0 provided @xmath2 .",
    "in fact the only important value that still depends on @xmath0 is the ratio of conclusively measured bits , @xmath46 , to the total signal length @xmath31 : @xmath118 . here",
    "the ratio scales as @xmath4 , since bob has a @xmath4 probability of choosing the same basis for his measurements as the one used by alice during preparation .",
    "consequently , there is little practical advantage for increasing the number of bases in the generalized 2d protocol .      for the @xmath119 case ,",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath54 are @xmath120 and the bit and phase error rates are @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "note that a direct relation between the bit and phase error rates can not be readily observed for this case . in order to obtain this relation ,",
    "we solve the problem of maximizing the phase error rate subject to a fixed bit error rate ( see appendix  [ app - epebrelation ] for detail ) .",
    "the resulting relation between bit and phase error rates is as follows : @xmath123 note that when @xmath124 , the phase error rate @xmath125 goes to infinity .",
    "this is because the two states in the second basis of the protocol are the same ( except for the phases ) as the two states in the first basis ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mbasis ] ) .",
    "thus , the protocol consists of only two orthogonal states and qkd can not be performed .",
    "we may utilize shor - preskill s argument @xcite to obtain the secret key generation rate @xcite as ( assuming the fraction @xmath49 of test bits goes to zero ) @xmath126,\\ ] ] where @xmath127 is the binary entropy function , @xmath47 is the observed bit error rate , and @xmath125 is the inferred phase error rate from eq .",
    "( for @xmath114 ) or eq .",
    "( for @xmath119 )",
    ". for the @xmath114 case , we may increase the key generation rate by incorporating the mutual information between bit and phase errors . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we may parameterize the diagonal elements as follows : @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 .",
    "the overall secret key generation rate is @xmath131 .",
    "% 1 - h(e_b ) - h(e_p ) + i(z ; x)\\ ] ] where @xmath132 . the parameter @xmath133 represents the mutual information , and in order to prove security , one needs to find the worst - case value of @xmath133 to compute the worst - case key generation rate . when one assumes pessimistically that @xmath134 , the worst - case value can easily be shown to be @xmath135 .",
    "in this case , no mutual information , if any , is incorporated in the key generation rate in eq .   and",
    "it reduces to the rate in eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , for the case when @xmath114 , we can see from eqs .   to that the admissible range of @xmath133",
    "is actually @xmath136 . in this case ,",
    "the worst - case value of @xmath133 is @xmath137 when @xmath138 and is @xmath135 otherwise .    as an example , we consider the sarg04 protocol ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) .",
    "using eq .  , the relation between bit and phase error rates is @xmath141 .",
    "assuming that @xmath142 , the worst - case value of @xmath133 is @xmath143 .",
    "these results agree with those in ref .",
    "in summary , we have proposed and proved the security of a generalized qkd protocol that includes the bb84 and sarg04 protocols as specific cases .",
    "we have derived a closed form formula for the relationship between the bit and phase error rates of the generalized protocol .",
    "such a relation allows us to place bounds on the security of the protocol .",
    "therefore we have provided a unified security proof for protocols with discrete rotational symmetry .",
    "we observe that when the number of bases is larger than two , discrete symmetry simplifies the effect of a noisy channel or eavesdropper , thus resulting in a simple relationship between bit and phase error rates . in this paper",
    ", we have only considered abelian symmetry . in future",
    ", it may be interesting to consider the role of non - abelian discrete symmetry in qkd .",
    "a similar security analysis involving a representation theory summation ( [ newdensitymatrix ] ) may prove useful when studying higher dimensional protocols such as the six - state protocol .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the diagonal elements of @xmath54 given in eq .  .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate by example how to derive eqs .  - by explicitly deriving eq .  .",
    "the other equations can be obtained in a similar way . to proceed , we first prove the following lemma .",
    "the following are spherical averages for @xmath2 : @xmath144    the trigonometric functions decompose into exponentials as : @xmath145    in addition , we have the geometric series    @xmath146    which follows directly for @xmath147 since the denominator is finite .",
    "thus , substitution of the former ( [ lemmaproof2 ] ) into the latter ( [ lemmaproof ] ) yields the desired result . in the special case",
    "where @xmath96 , equation ( [ lemmaproof ] ) is ill defined .",
