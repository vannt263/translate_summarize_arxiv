    "classical thermodynamics was originally designed to describe steam engines .",
    "it got its theoretical foundation in classical thermostatistics . now thermodynamics and the theory of phase transitions of homogeneous and large systems are some of the oldest and best established theories in physics .",
    "it may look surprising to add anything new to it .",
    "let me recapitulate what was told us since @xmath3 years :    * thermodynamics addresses large homogeneous systems at equilibrium ( in the thermodynamic limit @xmath4 ) .",
    "* phase transitions are the positive zeros of the grand - canonical partition sum @xmath5 as function of @xmath6 ( yang - lee - singularities ) .",
    "of course these singularities indicate the break - down of the ( grand-)canonical ensemble . *",
    "micro and canonical ensembles are equivalent .",
    "* thermodynamics works with intensive variables @xmath7 .",
    "* unique legendre mapping @xmath8 .",
    "* heat only flows from hot to cold ( clausius ) . * second law only in infinite systems when the poincar recurrence time becomes infinite ( much larger than the age of the universe ( boltzmann ) ) .    under these constraint",
    "only a tiny part of the real world of equilibrium systems can be treated .",
    "the ubiquitous non - homogeneous systems : nuclei , clusters , polymers , soft matter ( biological ) systems , but also the largest , astrophysical systems are not covered .",
    "even normal systems with short - range coupling at phase separations are inhomogeneous and can only be treated within conventional homogeneous thermodynamics ( e.g. in van - der - waals theory ) by bridging the unstable region of negative compressibility by a maxwell construction .",
    "thus even the original goal , for which thermodynamics was invented some @xmath9 years ago , the description of steam engines is only artificially solved .",
    "there is no ( grand-)canonical ensemble of phase separated and , consequently , inhomogeneous , configurations .",
    "this has a deep reason as i will discuss below : here the systems have a _ negative _ heat capacity @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "susceptibility ) .",
    "this , however , is impossible in the ( grand-)canonical theory where @xmath11    as was recently remarked by pitowsky@xcite : `` there is a schizophrenic attitude in the foundations of statistical mechanics .",
    "while boltzmann s view has been promoted as conceptional superior to that of gibbs , it is the canonical and not the microcanonical probability distribution that is extensively used in calculations .",
    "the claim being that the mathematical simplifications aside , all the ensembles are thermodynamically equivalent because as long we are dealing in systems containing a large number of molecules . '' .",
    "here , i will show that this is not only schizophrenic but is merely wrong in the most interesting situations . and that not only for small systems but also for the really large ones .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is the ensemble ( manifold ) of all possible points in the @xmath12 dimensional phase space at the prescribed sharp energy @xmath13 : @xmath14 thermodynamics addresses the whole ensemble .",
    "it is ruled by the topology of the geometrical size @xmath15 , as expressed on boltzmann s epitaph : @xmath16 which is the most fundamental definition of the entropy @xmath17 .",
    "entropy and with it micro - canonical thermodynamics has a pure mechanical , geometrical foundation .",
    "no information theoretical formulation is needed . moreover ,",
    "in contrast to the canonical entropy , @xmath18 is everywhere single valued and multiple differentiable .",
    "there is no need for extensivity , for concavity , for additivity , and no need for the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is a great advantage of the geometric foundation of equilibrium statistics over the conventional definition of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) canonical theory .",
    "however , addressing entropy to finite eventually small systems we will face a new problem with zermelo s objection against the monotonic rise of entropy , the second law . here the poincar recurrence time might be small and boltzmann s excuse does not work anymore .",
    "this is discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the topology of the hessian of @xmath19 , the determinant of curvatures of @xmath19 , determines completely all kinds of phase transitions .",
    "this is evidently so , because @xmath20 is the weight of each energy in the canonical partition sum at given @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , at phase separation this has at least two maxima , the two phases . and",
    "in between two maxima there must be a minimum where the curvature of @xmath22 is positive .",
    "i.e. the positive curvature detects phase separation .",
    "this is of course true also in the case of several conserved control parameters e.g. @xmath23 , in the case of the @xmath24 potts - gas model on a two dimensional lattice of _ finite _ size of @xmath25 lattice points . here",
    "the hessian is [ @xmath26 are the eigenvalues = eigen - curvatures ] : @xmath27 the whole zoo of phase - transitions can be sharply seen and distinguished [ fig.([det ] ) ] .",
    "the curvature ( hessian ) of @xmath28 controls the phase transitions see ref.@xcite . what is the physics behind a positive curvature ? for a short - range force it is linked to the interphase surface tension c.f . in fig.[naprl0f ] and to a _ negative heat capacity_. this implys that _ heat can flow from cold to hot _ , c.f .",
    "fig[heat ] .      in fig.[clusterfragmentation ]",
    "i show the simulation of a typical fragmentation transition of a system of @xmath29 sodium atoms interacting by realistic ( many - body ) forces . to compare with usual macroscopic conditions ,",
    "the calculations were done at each energy using a volume @xmath30 such that the microcanonical pressure @xmath31atm . evidently , the convex region of @xmath32 is the most interesting region .",
    "self - gravitation leads to a non - extensive potential energy @xmath33 .",
    "no thermodynamic limit exists for @xmath34 and no canonical treatment makes sense . at negative total energies often these systems have a negative heat capacity .",
    "this was for a long time considered as an absurd situation within canonical statistical mechanics with its thermodynamic `` limit '' .",
    "however , within our geometric theory this is just a simple example of the pseudo - riemannian topology of the microcanonical entropy @xmath35 provided that high densities with their non - gravitational physics , like nuclear hydrogen burning , are excluded .",
    "we treated the various phases of a self - gravitating cloud of particles as function of the total energy and angular momentum , c.f .",
    "fig.[prl ] and the quoted prl - paper .",
    "clearly these are the most important constraint in astrophysics . in fig.[phasediagram ] the global phase diagram of a rotating , selfgravitating hydrogen cloud is given .",
    "entropy has a simple and elementary definition by the _ area _ @xmath36 of the microcanonical ensemble in the @xmath12 dim .",
    "phase space .",
    "canonical ensembles are not equivalent to the micro - ensemble in the most interesting situations :    1 .   at phase - separation ( @xmath37heat engines ! ) , one gets inhomogeneities , and a negative heat capacity or some other negative susceptibility , consequently : 2 .",
    "heat can flow from cold to hot .",
    "3 .   phase transitions can be localized sharply and unambiguously in small classical or quantum systems , there is no need for finite size scaling to identify the transition .",
    "4 .   also really large self - gravitating systems can be addressed .",
    "entropy rises during the approach to equilibrium , @xmath38 , also for small mixing systems .",
    "i.e. the second law is valid even if the poincar recurrence time is not astronomically large @xcite",
    ".    with this geometric foundation thermo - statistics applies not only to extensive systems but also to non - extensive ones which have no thermodynamic limit .",
