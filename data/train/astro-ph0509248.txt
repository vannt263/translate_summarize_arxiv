    "observations of the soft x - ray and radio continua and the @xmath3 line emission support the idea of galactic winds from starburst galaxies ( see e.g. strickland @xcite for a review ) . in these galaxies which exibit a very high and spatially localised stellar formation rate , powerful stellar winds and supernova explosions produce a large amount of very hot gas .",
    "this gas expands out of the starburst region and forms a supersonic galactic wind flow .    also in more quiescent galaxies such as the milky way",
    "galactic wind flows can arise .",
    "they are primarily driven by cosmic rays ( ipavich @xcite ; breitschwerdt et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; zirakashvili et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in such galaxies",
    "the gas heated by a spatially extended supernova activity loses its energy largely by radiative loses , whereas the nonthermal cosmic ray component , produced in the same context , can only cool adiabatically .",
    "in addition , the cosmic rays produced in the galactic disk can not freely escape from the galaxy but rather amplify alfvn waves ( e.g. wentzel @xcite ) that lead to an efficient dynamical coupling of the thermal gas to the energetic particle component ( ptuskin et al .",
    "therefore the cosmic ray pressure gradient is the dominant driver of such an extended galactic wind flow . due to the different mechanisms these two types of outflow have somewhat different characteristics .",
    "chevalier & clegg ( @xcite ) introduced an elegant analytical hydrodynamic model for the galactic wind flow from a starburst galaxy .",
    "it assumes steady - state spherical symmetry . despite its simplicity",
    "it seems qualitatively valid and is often used for estimates of the x - ray distribution and of the cosmic ray propagation .    however , the assumed spherical shape of the starburst region is a disadvantage of this model . in many cases",
    "the starburst region has an ellipsoidal shape or a disk geometry .",
    "they are more adequate for the problem considered .",
    "an analytical approach to this case is not simple because one should solve at least a two - dimensional system of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "for this reason a number of numerical calculations for galactic wind flows have been made ( e.g. habe & ikeuchi @xcite ; tomisaka & ikeuchi @xcite ; suchkov et al .",
    "@xcite ; strickland & stevens @xcite ) .",
    "they take also the temporal evolution of the flow into account .",
    "these studies evidently show that the powerful energy release in the starburst region produces forward and backward shocks propagating in the galactic halo .",
    "they move mainly perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "after 3 - 10 million years ( depending on the surrounding halo gas density ) the shocks break through into the intergalactic medium . at smaller distances",
    "the galactic wind flow becomes steady state .",
    "it is bounded by almost vertical walls of the shocked wind and halo gas ( e.g. suchkov et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations can be significantly simplified for so - called self - similar stationary flows .",
    "this means that different streamlines have the same shape but different scales .",
    "the equations then reduce to ordinary differential equations .",
    "this approach was first introduced by bardeen & berger ( @xcite ) for galactic winds .",
    "it has been successfully used in the theory of collimated rotating magnetohydrodynamic flows from accretion disks and of active galactic nuclei ( e.g. blandford & payne @xcite ; contopoulos & lovelace @xcite ) . in spite of rather stringent boundary conditions at the base of the flow in the form of a spatial power - law gas pressure dependence",
    ", it appears to us as a useful tool .",
    "* indeed * many nuclear starbursts do show power - law pressure profiles at distances of 100 to 1000 pc from the nucleus in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the major axis ( e.g. heckman et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we shall use such a self - similar approach for the description of the single - fluid hydrodynamic outflow from a starburst galaxy .",
    "we have in particular found an explicit nontrivial analytic solution for one special ( but not unreasonable ) power - law dependence of the gas pressure at the base of the wind .",
    "we apply the solution found to a calculation of the radio emission from the central 600 pc of the starburst galaxy ngc253 . the required additional transport equation for nonthermal relativistic electrons couples the synchrotron emission morphology , intensity , and spectrum with the overall outflow dynamics .",
    "this permits a determination of the flow speed @xmath4 and of the cosmic ray energy production rate @xmath5 as a measure of the total mechanical energy production @xmath6 in supernovae , through a comparison with the radio synchrotron observations .",
    "we limit ourselves to this central region because a purely advective propagation model for the cosmic ray electrons is used .",
    "such a model would not be adequate for the outer part of ngc253 since this outer region exhibits a steep radio spectrum ( hummel et al .",
    "@xcite , carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ) where diffusion dominates advection .",
    "our approach may be considered as complementary to other methods related with x - ray and optical spectroscopic observations .",
    "the basic equations are given in the next section .",
    "a one - dimensional model for a thin starburst region similar to chevalier & clegg s model is described in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains the analytic solution which we found .",
    "applications of this solution to cosmic ray propagation in the galaxy ngc 253 are given in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "the outflow parameters derived are described in section 7 .",
    "section 8 contains a discussion of the results obtained together with our conclusions .",
    "we shall assume that the starburst region lies in the galactic disk .",
    "the problem considered is mirror symmetric relative to the galactic midplane .",
    "the galactic wind flow originates in the disk and extends into the galactic halo . in this region",

    "( 9 ) and ( 13)-(15 ) one integral of the system can be found as    @xmath50    the bernoulli constant for the each streamline differs from this integral by the factor @xmath51 .    as a result",
    "the problem is reduced to the solution of two ordinary differential equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) with the additional integral ( 16 ) .",
    "if the solution is known , the function @xmath52 can be found from eq .",

    "one can expect that the hot gas expands perpendicular to the disk in that case .",

    "we can calculate the midplane gas pressure @xmath64 if the mach number @xmath70 at the boundary of the starburst disk @xmath71 is given .",
    "its value is determined by the wind solution in the halo region ( cf .",
    "next section ) .",
    "e.g. @xmath72 in the chevalier & clegg model ( @xcite ) . using eqs .",
    "( 20)-(22 ) we found the gas pressure , the gas mass density and the gas velocity at the boundary of the starburst disk    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    these quantities formally coincide with the corresponding quantities at the wind base in the thin disk approximation : @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we should underline that this solution is rather general and is not related to self - similarity of the halo outflow .",
    "it is valid for any distribution of energy and mass sources @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the galactic disk .",
    "however , the value of @xmath81 in general depends on @xmath41 and is determined by a solution in the halo region . for a starburst outflow @xmath81 is close to unity if the adiabatic index is not close to unity ( see also the next section ) .",
    "in the case @xmath82 an analytical solution of eqs . ( 14)-(16 ) can be found in the first quadrant @xmath83 :    @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87    here the value of @xmath88 fixes the asymptotic velocity at distances @xmath7 that are large compared to the radius @xmath41 for each streamline @xmath89 .",
    "the flow lines for this solution for @xmath90 and @xmath91 and the surfaces of constant mach number are shown in fig.1 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath92 and @xmath58 .",

    "we have not found the solutions for @xmath95 and for a natural boundary condition @xmath54 at @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the analytical solution with @xmath82 has the maximally opened flowlines in the framework of self - similar flows .     and @xmath96 and surfaces of constant mach number ( _ dashed lines _ ) .",
    "the units of the cylindrical coordinates @xmath92 and @xmath58 are arbitrary .",
    "the mach number values are shown near the corresponding _ dashed lines_. , width=283 ]    as was first noted by bardeen & berger ( @xcite ) the equations for self - similar flow do not contain any particular points corresponding to sonic points of the flow .",
    "the only particular point is the point where the sonic velocity equals the latitudinal component of the flow velocity ( cf .",
    "this component is always smaller than the sonic velocity in the solutions found .",
    "the wind starts at the base with subsonic velocity ( initial mach number @xmath97 for @xmath90 ) .",
    "it is accelerated and passes through the sonic point at about @xmath98 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this picture corresponds to a flow in a laval nozzle .",
    "the cross - section of the laval nozzle shrinks in the subsonic part of the flow in order to reach sonic velocities and expands after the sonic point in order to obtain an acceleration of the flow beyond .",
    "as can be seen in fig.1 this is indeed the case .",
    "it is interesting that this flow geometry is organized by the gas itself through the perpendicular force balance . at the base of the wind",
    "the gas pushes the flowlines out of the axis . at larger heights",
    "the situation is reversed .",
    "the wind originating closer to the axis expands faster .",
    "the gas pressure drops adiabatically and the gas pressure of the wind originating at larger distances pushes the flow lines to the axis .",
    "we shall neglect the diffusion of energetic electrons in the starburst outflow .",
    "this seems reasonable since the flow velocity is quite high . in addition , the cosmic ray scattering produced by self - excited alfvn waves ( ptuskin et al .",
    "@xcite ) should be very effective in starbursts .",
    "this effect reduces the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient .",
    "the estimates of this effect in our galaxy give for the diffusion coefficient the value @xmath99",
    "@xmath100 s@xmath1 for an energy of 10 gev ( cf .",
    "ptuskin et al .",
    "it is inversely proportional to the cosmic ray production power per unit area of the galactic disk and is proportional to the magnetic field strength .",
    "since starbursts have a high cosmic ray production power per unit area , typically a factor of 100 to 1000 or more larger than in our galaxy , and since the magnetic field is a factor of 10 larger , the diffusion coefficient in starbursts is smaller by at least a factor of 10 to 100 , and the diffusion is negligible in comparison with advection for 10 gev electrons which produce radio synchrotron emission ( for an application of these ideas to tev gamma - ray emitting particles , see aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient of much higher energy particles can in addition become quite small , if one takes into account that the starburst region is very turbulent , leading to additional strong magnetic field fluctuations which are produced by the turbulent velocity field .",
    "assuming azimuthal symmetry and a steady state the isotropic part of the cosmic ray energy distribution function @xmath101 obeys the following equation    @xmath102 @xmath103 here the second term on the right hand side describes the adiabatic energy losses , while @xmath104 describes all other energy losses of particles .",
    "the boundary condition at the wind base @xmath27 can be written as    @xmath105    here @xmath106 is the electron energy distribution at the wind base , @xmath107 describes non - adiabatic energy losses in the thin starburst region and @xmath108 is the differential source energy spectrum of cosmic ray electrons normalized per unit area of the galactic disk .",
    "the synchrotron emissivity @xmath109 can be written as    @xmath110    here @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the charge and the mass of an electron respectively , @xmath113 is the strength of magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight , @xmath114 is the radio - frequency , @xmath115 is the light velocity and @xmath116 is the function that describes the electron synchrotron emission ( cf . landau & lifshitz @xcite ) .",

    "we shall neglect bremsstrahlung and ionisation losses of electrons in the galactic wind flow .",
    "this is well justified , since the wind density is small .",
    "however , these losses may be non - negligible in the galactic disk which contains a large mass of gas .",
    "they are described by the second term on the left hand side of the boundary condition ( 34 ) .",
    "the estimates show that these losses can be significant in the very center of a starburst .",
    "this depends on the gas mass that is rather uncertain .",
    "in addition it is not clear , whether radio electrons can well penetrate into gas clouds or whether they are quickly transported around clouds by the hot rarefied wind .",
    "the cosmic ray penetration into the gas clouds in the starburst region is beyond the scope of this paper . for the sake of simplicity we shall neglect these energy losses in the disk also .",
    "the function @xmath116 can be expressed in terms of the mc - donald function .",
    "a so - called @xmath94-function approximation is often used for the function @xmath116 .",
    "we shall use a more accurate method and approximate @xmath116 as ( pacholczyk @xcite ) : @xmath123 where @xmath124 .    the synchrotron intensity observed in a particular direction",
    "is given by the integral of the emissivity along the line of sight :    @xmath125    the spectrum of sources of cosmic ray electrons is given by    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the total power that is transfered by galactic sources to high energy cosmic ray protons with energies between @xmath128 and @xmath129 per unit area of the galactic disk , and @xmath130 is the proton to electron ratio in the source .",
    "it is expected that such a spectrum is formed in supernova remnants by the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism ( krymsky @xcite , axford et al .",
    "@xcite , bell @xcite , blandford & ostriker @xcite ) .",
    "we shall neglect the production of secondary electrons and positrons by the nucleonic cosmic ray component in the dense gas disk .",
    "although this effect can be essential for starbursts ( cf .",
    "paglione et al .",
    "@xcite ) , its magnitude is rather uncertain because of the uncertain gas mass and the uncertain degree of penetration of the @xmath131 gev cosmic nucleons into the gas clouds .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that radiation field is distributed similar to distribution of energy production in the starburst disk .    for a calculation of the synchrotron emissivity",

    "the continuum radio emission of galaxies consists of two main components : synchrotron emission of cosmic ray electrons and a thermal emission of the ionized gas which is produced mainly in hii regions , ionized by ob stars ( see e.g. condon @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the thermal emission is closely related with thermal ( so - called free - free ) absorption which can be significant at low frequencies and can produce a flattening and even a turnover of the spectrum .",
    "it appears that this indeed the case for the spectrum of the nucleus of ngc 253 ( carilli @xcite ) .",
    "other possible reasons for the flattening are reacceleration of low - energy electrons ( pohl & schlickeiser @xcite ) , and ionisation and bremsstrahlung energy losses of electrons in the starburst disk ( hummel , @xcite ) .",
    "we give preference to free - free absorption here , since the thermal component of the radio emission is undoubtedly present in ngc 253 .    to take free - free absorption into account",
    "we shall assume that the thin galactic disk seen face - on has the following distribution of the absorption depth @xmath166 here @xmath167 is the absorption depth of the disk at 1 ghz and at @xmath168 .",
    "it was assumed that this distribution is similar to the distribution of sources of energy in the galactic disk .",

    "this is possibly not the case in the disk of ngc 253 .",
    "however it is possible in the central region , where the main part of the absorption occurs .",
    "we should take into account the synchrotron emission of supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the starburst disk .",
    "the snrs in the disk have a small volume filling factor . however , the magnetic field strength and the number density of relativistic electrons in snrs are larger in comparison with the corresponding quantities in the interstellar medium of the starburst disk and in the wind halo .",
    "we used the following expression for the brightness of the radio emission produced by the snrs from the inclined disk :    @xmath173 @xmath174 this emission from snrs is also influenced by free - free absorption .",
    "the total radio flux @xmath175 from snrs is about one tenth of the total radio flux for normal galaxies ( condon @xcite ) , but it can be larger in galaxies with a fast escape of electrons . a more quantitative estimate was obtained by ulvestad ( @xcite ) using the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter ( the @xmath176 relation , see also berezhko & vlk @xcite ) :    @xmath177 @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the supernova rate .",

    "the radio distribution was convolved with a gaussian beam with fwhm @xmath191 ( @xmath192 pc at 2.5 mpc distance ) , and an inclination angle of @xmath193 was used .",
    "the distribution is slightly asymmetric relative to the horizontal axis due to free - free absorption .",
    "the comparison with the observed distribution ( mohan et al .",

    "the value of the radio flux @xmath175 from snrs corresponds to the supernova rate @xmath200 yr@xmath1 which is intermediate between the value @xmath201 yr@xmath1 of matila & meikle ( @xcite ) and @xmath202 yr@xmath1 ( ulvestad & antonucci @xcite ) .",
    "finally , a mean number density @xmath203 @xmath204 of the interstellar medium in ngc253 ( paglione et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and a mean energy of supernova explosions @xmath205 erg were assumed in eq .",
    "the uncertainty of the velocity derived in this way is larger from the side of higher velocities .",

    "a similar shift in the opposite direction corresponds to @xmath207 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the derived value @xmath208 km s@xmath1 produces a good similarity between observed and modeled radio distribution in the southern part of the outflow .",
    "we think that the radio distribution in the northern part of the outflow should be explained by using a more complex model with slightly larger and variable wind velocities along the base ( for example , another function @xmath24 might be used ) .",
    "this can produce spur - like features in the observed radio distribution in the northern part of the outflow .",
    "another possible explanation is limb - brightening due to the superwind s lateral interaction with halo gas which is not included in our model .    the spectrum of the ngc 253 nuclear region is shown in fig.3 ( solid line ) .",

    "this is in good agreement with results for the separation of the thermal and nonthermal emission for the whole galaxy ngc 253 ( niklas et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the fit can be better if a smaller temperature of the emitting gas is used .",
    "it should be noted that israel & mahoney ( @xcite ) found that the flattening of the radio spectra of galaxies at small frequencies can be explained by free - free absorption in a hypothetical cold ionized gas .",
    "the observed synchrotron intensity mainly constrains the ratio of the cosmic ray power @xmath165 to the wind velocity . the wind velocity and cosmic ray power influence the spectral shape of the radio emission only weakly .",
    "the cosmic ray luminosity found corresponds to the cosmic ray pressure at the wind base ( at @xmath152 ) : @xmath211 this gives @xmath212 erg @xmath204 at the wind base at @xmath168 .",

    "we have modificated the chevalier & clegg model ( @xcite ) for a thin starburst region ( cf .",
    "sect.3 ) . in the particular case of the analytical solution ( 29),(30),(45),(46 ) , the eqs . ( 26 )  ( 28 ) can be rewritten as    @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216 @xmath217 @xmath218 @xmath219 here @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the total energy and mass production rates of the starburst disk at @xmath153 .",
    "the energy production rate is determined mainly by supernovae .",
    "the upper limit for the supernova rate in the nucleus of ngc 253 is 0.3 yr@xmath1 ( ulvestad & antonucci @xcite ) .",
    "it seems that the actual number is not larger than 0.1 yr@xmath1 because of the absence of a new supernova during the last years . for a supernova rate 0.06 yr@xmath1 in ngc 253 the energy production rate @xmath222 erg s@xmath1 under the assumption of negligible radiative losses of the gas .",
    "the nonthermal luminosity found in the previous section is about one quarter of this number .    since part of the supernova energy",
    "can be lost radiatively , the energy input may be smaller .",
    "the x - ray observations give an the energy input @xmath223 erg s@xmath1 ( strickland et al .",
    "@xcite ) and an average wind velocity @xmath4 between 400 and 500 km s@xmath1 that is between the velocity 300 km s@xmath1 at the wind base and the asymptotic velocity 900 km s@xmath1 found in the previous section .    for this case we found the mass - loss rate @xmath224 yr@xmath1 , and the total pressure @xmath225 erg @xmath204 at @xmath152 and a factor of 15 larger at a distance of 50 pc from the nucleus .",
    "these numbers should be compared with the cosmic ray and magnetic pressures derived in the previous section @xmath226 erg @xmath204 and @xmath227 erg @xmath204 respectively .",
    "therefore the nonthermal pressure is almost one half of the total pressure .",
    "the rest can be attributed to the thermal gas pressure , that is @xmath228 erg @xmath204 .",
    "the corresponding mass density is @xmath229 g @xmath204 .",
    "the corresponding temperature of a one - phase fully ionized gas is about @xmath230 k.    this is not surprising .",
    "if 15 procent of the supernova energy is converted into cosmic ray energy and the rest is partially radiated , then the gas pressure may be comparable with the cosmic ray pressure . in this case",
    "it is reasonable to use a smaller adiabatic index @xmath231 of the gas to include cosmic rays and magnetic fields .    in reality ,",
    "a one - phase thermal gas with a temperature of several million degrees is excluded by the x - ray observations , since it would produce too large an amount of x - rays ( strickland et al .",
    "the main fraction of the thermal energy may rather be contained in an even hotter gas component , and the main part of the mass may then be contained in gas with a temperature below one million degrees .",
    "we can even consider an extreme case by assuming that the gas radiates all its energy .",
    "the superwind flow is then driven by cosmic rays and alfvn waves ( or turbulent magnetic fields ) alone . using a nonthermal luminosity @xmath232 erg s@xmath1 ,",
    "as found in the last section , we then obtain a mass - loss rate of @xmath233 yr@xmath1 .",
    "we have presented a simple analytical model for a steady state axially symmetric gas - dynamic outflow from a starburst galaxy . in the case of a power - law radial distribution of the gas pressure at the wind base self - similar solutions can be found .",
    "for the special choice of the power - law index @xmath234 we found an explicit analytical solution .",
    "this value of the index seems reasonable , since many starbursts show a strong concentration of the energy release towards the center .",
    "the solution found has less steep pressure and density profiles in comparison with the chevalier & clegg model ( chevalier & clegg @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the chevalier & clegg solution is in agreement with the x - ray brightness of m82 at distances larger than 1 - 2 kpc from the nucleus , whereas at smaller distances the observed brightness relief is lower ( e.g. fabbiano @xcite ) .",
    "this may be understood in the framework of our model . at distances smaller than the starburst region gas collimation is possible .",
    "this results in weaker dependencies on radius . at larger distances",
    "the wind geometry is roughly spherically symmetric , perpendicular forces play no role and the chevalier & clegg model is more adequate .    in reality",
    "the power - law pressure dependence can not be valid at small radii either , i.e. there exists some minimum radius .",
    "the wind originating inside this radius is not described by the self - similar solution . however , for a small minimum radius it blows in a narrow region near the axis .",
    "therefore this restriction appears not to be essential .",
    "the solution found was applied to the modeling of the radio distribution of the central part ( @xmath235 pc ) of the starburst galaxy ngc 253 .",
    "this galaxy contains a very bright radio nucleus with a flat spectrum ( with spectral index rnaging from @xmath236 to @xmath237 at different frequencies ) and a less bright extended radio disk with a steeper spectrum of spectral index -0.7 ( hummel et al .",
    "@xcite , carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the propagation of the radio electrons can be purely advective in the central part of ngc 253 since the gas velocity is rather high ( about 1000 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "it appears that this velocity is smaller in the outer part of the galactic disk ( @xmath238 kpc ) where the spectrum is steeper .",
    "it is possible that the outer part contains a cosmic ray driven galactic wind which has small velocity at the wind base ( cf .",
    "breitschwerdt et .",
    "@xcite ; zirakashvili et al .",
    "@xcite ) and where the diffusion of particles results in the spectral steepening .",
    "our model is applicable for the central superwind region ( @xmath235 pc ) of ngc253 which contains the central starburst .",
    "ngc253 has also a comparable energy release at larger distances .",
    "however this is distributed over an area which is at least a factor 100 - 1000 larger than the central starburst .",
    "our model does not describe that region which contains a quasi - static galactic halo or a slow cosmic - ray driven galactic wind .",
    "it also does not describe the interaction of the gas in this region with the superwind flow .",
    "we have obtained a satisfactory fit for the radio brightness distribution and for the radio spectrum of the nucleus of ngc 253 .",
    "this permits us to estimate the parameters of the outflow : the wind velocity and mass loss rate of the starburst .    from a physics point of view",
    "these quantities should be determined from a theoretical model which describes how thermalised supernova ejecta and the interstellar gas heated by supernova shocks radiate some part of the energy and form an outflow from the starburst disk . in the absence of such a theory we limit ourself to the determination of these quantities from observations .",
    "we found an asymptotic velocity of 900 km s@xmath1 from this inner region .",
    "for an energy input of @xmath239 erg s@xmath1 in the starburst nucleus of ngc253 we obtain a mass loss rate of @xmath240 yr@xmath1 .",
    "this number drops down to @xmath241 yr@xmath1 for the extreme case when the gas radiates almost all its energy .",
    "even this case does not contradict the x - ray observations , since it appears that the x - rays are produced by a hot gas that is formed from the interaction between the superwind and the circumstellar medium ( halo gas , clouds etc . )",
    "strickland et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the cosmic ray production power is estimated as 15 procent of the supernova power .",
    "we found that cosmic ray and magnetic pressures are comparable with the gas pressure .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the starburst outflow in ngc 253 is collectively driven by hot gas , cosmic rays and turbulent magnetic fields ."
