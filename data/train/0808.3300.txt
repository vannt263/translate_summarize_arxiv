    "<S> furthermore , we discuss the potential of this method for the detection and spectroscopy of weakly emitting systems such as rare earth ions .    </S>",
    "<S> the progress of nanoscience and technology in the past two decades has been accompanied by a growing interest in the optical study of single nano - objects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a major thrust in this research area came from cryogenic spectroscopy  @xcite as well as room temperature detection  @xcite and microscopy  @xcite of dye molecules . although a fluorescent atom suspended in vacuum can be seen even by the naked eye , achieving a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the detection of single molecules </S>",
    "<S> is a nontrivial task in the condensed phase . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the background light and noise associated with the fluorescence or scattering from the environment can easily dominate the small signal of a single emitter . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the dark counts and noise of photodetectors put a limit on the lowest signals that one might hope to detect .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup]a , the level scheme of a fluorescent molecule consists of vibrational manifolds in the electronic ground ( @xmath0 ) and excited ( @xmath1 ) states . for an appropriate combination of an emitter and its surrounding matrix , the linewidth of the so - called zero - phonon line ( zpl ) of the 0 - 0 transition between the vibrational ground states of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can become lifetime limited at cryogenic temperatures , thus enhancing the emitter s absorption cross section @xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a very successful method for detecting a single molecule with a narrow 0 - 0 zpl has been fluorescence excitation spectroscopy  @xcite where the red - shifted incoherent fluorescence of the molecule at wavelength @xmath3 is separated from the light at the laser wavelength @xmath4 by using high quality spectral filters . the snr of this technique is determined on the one hand by the detector noise , which can be as low as 20 - 100 counts per second ( cps ) for very good avalanche photodiode single photon counters . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , saturation limits the maximum attainable signal to typical values of @xmath5  cps on the detector for a good dye molecule . </S>",
    "<S> thus , fluorescence excitation spectroscopy can enjoy a very healthy snr when applied to strongly fluorescent systems . </S>",
    "<S> detection of very weak emitters , however , remains a challenge . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , fluorescence detection of single rare earth ions has been hampered owing to their long lifetimes and therefore ultra weak fluorescence .    </S>",
    "<S> , width=321 ]    an alternative approach to the detection of single solid - state emitters is to go back to the first method that was applied in single molecule spectroscopy  @xcite , namely to detect the extinction of the laser light caused by a single molecule in its path . </S>",
    "<S> this method was successfully revived by plakhotnik and palm in 2001  @xcite where the coherent scattering of the excitation light was interfered with the residual reflections from the interfaces in the setup . </S>",
    "<S> closely related efforts followed on quantum dots , especially with the aim of acquiring access to the linewidth of the main optical transition in these systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have extended this approach to detect the extinction of a laser beam by a single molecule in transmission without the need for any noise suppression technique  @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the conventional fluorescence excitation technique with extinction measurements in terms of the snr and discuss the potential of the latter for detecting emitters with very weak optical transitions .    </S>",

    "<S> briefly , the excitation laser light was focused onto the sample consisting of dbatt molecules embedded in a _ </S>",
    "<S> n_-tetradecane matrix inside a cryostat . for this </S>",
    "<S> we used an aspheric lens with a numerical aperture of @xmath6 and a cubic zirconia hemispherical solid immersion lens ( sil ) . </S>",
    "<S> after interaction with the sample , a second aspheric lens collimates the beam and directs it to an avalanche photodiode ( pd ) . </S>",
    "<S> two different filter sets are used to either reject @xmath4 and detect @xmath3 or vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the former arrangement delivers a fluorescence excitation spectrum while the latter allows a direct resonant measurement . </S>",

    "<S> [ spectra ] shows examples of fluorescence and extinction spectra recorded from the same single molecule and on the same detector at three different incident powers . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the unit of counts per second ( cps ) for power . </S>",
    "<S> when the detected laser power reads @xmath7 cps on pd ( corresponding to an excitation regime well below saturation ) both extinction ( a ) and fluorescence ( b ) yield comparable snr of @xmath8 @xmath9 . for a detected laser power of @xmath10 cps , the fluorescence of the molecule is hardly above the detector dark count rate of 100 cps . </S>",
    "<S> however , the extinction is still easily observable at 10% visibility . </S>",

    "<S> the molecular emission @xmath19 consists of a part that originates from the 0 - 0 zpl transition and is resonant with the laser light and a red - shifted component which results from molecular and lattice vibronic transitions . the electric field associated with the coherent part of the resonance fluorescence  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ mainformula ] ) , signifying the interference between the molecular emission and the laser beam . </S>",
    "<S> this component , which is known as the  extinction \" term  @xcite is equivalent to a homodyne signal where the excitation laser beam acts as the local oscillator  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is helpful for the following discussion to write the terms of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mainformula ] ) in an explicit manner : @xmath21 the quantity @xmath22 gives the total power emitted by the molecule into the @xmath23 solid angle . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 is the population of the excited state , and the on - resonance saturation parameter s reads  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the rabi frequency defined by @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition dipole moment @xmath28 and the incident electric field @xmath29 at position of the molecule are assumed to be parallel for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath30 describes the ratio of the power emitted on the 0 - 0 zpl to the total excited state emission . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the dipole moment associated with the total spontaneous emission rate of the excited state given by @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 represents the transverse decay rate which equals @xmath35 in the absence of any dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath36 signifies the fraction of the total emitted molecular power to that collected into the detection solid angle @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in addition , one might have to account for total internal reflection and waveguiding in the substrate which influence the angular distribution of the laser light and the molecular emission  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the portions of the molecular emission into the solid angle @xmath18 that are resonant with the excitation laser and red shifted from it , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now instructive to separate the properties of the laser beam from the spectroscopic features of the emitter . using the definitions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> , one can rearrange the saturation parameter in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ saturation-1 ] ) to read @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a unitless geometrical factor that relates @xmath43 to the laser power @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , @xmath42 denotes the ratio of the total power scattered by a weakly excited two - level system and the incident power . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the spatial mode of the laser beam and the focusing optics . </S>",
    "<S> the reader is referred to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details .    </S>",
    "<S> the expressions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bunch ] ) provide us with the red shifted fluorescence @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the noise on this signal is given by the fluctuations in the detector dark counts @xmath45 if we assume that the excitation light is completely rejected by the filters . thus , the snr for a fluorescence excitation measurement becomes @xmath46 where we have introduced @xmath47 to account for losses ( e.g. cryostat windows , filters , etc . ) and the detector efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the snr maximum is given by @xmath48 and occurs in the fully saturated regime .    </S>",
    "<S> considering that the solid angle @xmath18 collects all the incident laser light , a simple energy balance argument implies that @xmath49 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mainformula ] ) must correspond to the total power @xmath50 emitted by the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> now we insert a spectral filter to select only the part of the transmitted light that is resonant with the laser light . denoting the size of the dip in the power that is detected in this case by @xmath51 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mainformula ] ) and eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bunch ] ) yield , @xmath52 the noise on a resonant extinction measurement is composed of the shot noise @xmath53 of the laser power , the laser intensity fluctuations @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a proportionality constant , and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> since these contributions are statistically independent , the total noise can be written as @xmath57 , where again , @xmath47 accounts for losses and the detection efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that intensity fluctuations have been mastered at a sufficient level and that @xmath58 , one finds @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the signal - to - noise ratio for an extinction measurement becomes @xmath60 fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ intensity - dependence ] presents @xmath61 as a function of the detected laser power @xmath62 and of the saturation parameter @xmath63 . in each case , @xmath63 was directly derived from the power broadened linewidth of the fluorescence excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our system could perform at the shot - noise limit down to the sub hertz bandwidth over the whole power range presented here . </S>",
    "<S> the green theoretical fit curve is obtained using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ snrext ] ) . with the parameters that have been independently determined for our setup ( @xmath64 , @xmath65=0.5 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , an excellent agreement with the measured data is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the deterioration of @xmath61 under very strong excitation is clearly visible and stems from the fact that for a quantum emitter , @xmath68 saturates at high incident powers . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal attainable snr in a shot - noise limited resonant detection then becomes @xmath69 and occurs at s=1 if we assume @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    to compare the snr of fluorescence and extinction measurements directly , we have recorded spectra such as those shown in fig .  [ spectra ] for low excitation powers corresponding to @xmath71 to @xmath72 as shown in fig .  [ comparison ] . </S>",
    "<S> the circles and the triangles display the snr for the extinction and fluorescence detections , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> to determine the experimental snr , we first fitted the spectra with lorentzian functions </S>",
    "<S> . then we extracted the on - resonant signal and divided it by the off - resonant rms noise . </S>",
    "<S> the data were recorded by adding 100 scans with 10  ms integration time , corresponding to a total acquisition time of 1 second per frequency pixel . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure helped to correct for possible laser drifts and spectral diffusion of the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted green and red theoretical curves depend on @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively ( see eqs .  ( [ snrfluo ] ) and ( [ snrext ] ) ) and show a very good agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in case of a weakly excited system , an extinction measurement can be superior to fluorescence detection in terms of snr . </S>",
    "<S> we point out in passing that both @xmath75 and @xmath76 scale as the square root of the integration time and thus , the comparison between the fluorescence and extinction methods holds for fast and slow measurements alike .    , width=302 ]    we remark that in the existing literature , the root - mean - square ( rms ) fluctuation of the signal itself has been often included as a noise source in fluorescence but ignored in extinction measurements  @xcite . in our comparison of the two methods , </S>",
    "<S> we have consistently chosen to define the signal as the response of the system of interest , namely a single emitter , and the noise as all fluctuations stemming from other sources . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we do not include the signal rms noise in our analysis of snr . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy is particularly convenient for the evaluation of snr from single spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> an exciting question that arises is whether extinction detection opens doors for studying weakly fluorescent nano - objects . </S>",
    "<S> conventional single molecule detection has been successful for molecules that have fluorescence lifetimes of a few nanoseconds , corresponding to @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> such a high photon flux provides a good snr even considering realistic collection plus detection efficiency of a few percent and @xmath78 cps . </S>",
    "<S> however , for weakly emitting systems such as rare earth ions with lifetimes of the order of milliseconds , @xmath79 becomes comparable or smaller than unity . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ linewidth - dependence ] displays the expected @xmath80 as a function of the detected laser power for various radiative decay rates @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> here we have assumed a laboratory value of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , but extension of the results to other situations is straightforward by following eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ snrext ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these plots indicate that single emitters with spontaneous emission times as long as a millisecond should be detectable using extinction spectroscopy even when realistic detection parameters ( e.g. @xmath85 are considered . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we emphasize that extinction measurements have the great added value that they provide direct access to the coherent interaction of the incident light and the emitter .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45=20  cps , and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 is given in units of @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> [ linewidth - dependence],width=302 ]    although the basic concepts discussed in this paper have been known in signal processing and electrical engineering  @xcite , their direct experimental investigations at the single emitter level have been made possible through advances in cryogenic spectroscopy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by this progress , very recently we have also succeeded in extinction detection of a single solid - state quantum emitter at room temperature  @xcite despite the fact that the extinction cross section is reduced by 5 - 6 orders of magnitude due to severe broadening of the transition ( @xmath87 ) . another interesting application of extinction or homodyne detection has been demonstrated almost independently for imaging small metallic and dielectric nanoparticles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conventional methods of nanoparticle detection such as dark - field  @xcite or total internal reflection  @xcite microscopy rely on the elimination of the incident light from the detection path and the detection of the power scattered by the particles . to this end , these techniques are analogous to fluorescence excitation spectroscopy where frequency spectra are replaced by spatial images , and spatial filtering substitutes spectral filtering for the discrimination of the incident laser light . however , in practice the two systems are limited in different ways because in the case of spatial imaging , the persistent source of `` noise '' is the light scattered from residual optical roughness of the medium  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent of this problem usually does not arise in extinction detection of emitters because they are typically embedded in well - behaved matrices  @xcite without any optical transitions in the spectral region of interest .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have explored the signal - to - noise ratio in the spectroscopic detection of single emitters . </S>",
    "<S> we have provided expressions for evaluating the performance of both fluorescence and extinction measurements . in particular , we have demonstrated that extinction measurements can be superior to fluorescence detection in the weak excitation regime . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that even weakly fluorescent emitters should be detectable using coherent extinction spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> this prospect is especially interesting for the optical storage and read out of quantum information in new systems such as rare earth ions . </S>"
