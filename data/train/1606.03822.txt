    "the pyrochlore oxides  @xcite show several fascinating phenomena , and the electronic states of some pyrochlore oxides are categorized into a @xmath0-orbital system with the tetrahedral sublattice structure under the trigonal - distortion potential .",
    "one of the fascinating phenomena is the formation of heavy fermions : in the paramagnetic metallic state of liv@xmath3o@xmath4 , the low - temperature coefficient of the electronic specific heat becomes about @xmath5j / mol - k@xmath6 , indicating the largest mass enhancement in transition - metal compounds  @xcite .",
    "another is the thermal - hall effect : in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) mott insulating state of lu@xmath3v@xmath3o@xmath7 , the temperature gradient leads to the heat flow perpendicular to it  @xcite . as an example of the pyrochlore oxides ,",
    "let us consider the pyrochlore vanadates .",
    "the v ions form a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra , and each v ion and six o ions form a octahedron  @xcite ; four v ions of a tetrahedron correspond to the sublattice degrees of freedom [ see fig . [ fig1](a ) ] , and the nearest - neighbor v ions are connected by an o ion . then",
    ", the @xmath0 orbitals of the v ions , i.e. , the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 orbitals , give the main contributions to the bands near the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the trigonal distortion reduces the symmetry group around a v ion , and splits the @xmath0 orbitals into the singlet @xmath11 orbital and the doublet @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbitals [ fig . [ fig1](b ) ] ; the @xmath11 orbital and the @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbitals correspond to the basis functions of the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 irreducible representations , respectively .",
    "orbitals under the trigonal - distortion potential , @xmath16.,width=317 ]    a key quantity to understand some properties of the pryrochlore oxides may be the dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction .",
    "the dm interaction  @xcite has been believed to be realized in the pyrochlore oxides because of lack of the inversion center in each nearest - neighbor v - v bond of a tetrahedron  @xcite .",
    "this realization was pointed out by the phenomenological argument  @xcite : the authors of ref . showed the possible components of the dm interaction without the inversion center .",
    "this result may be correct because the fitting of the spin - wave dispersions obtained in the inelastic neutron scattering  @xcite for lu@xmath3v@xmath3o@xmath7 suggests the finite dm interaction , although this fitting was carried out in a rough model and there is a controversy about the value of the dm interaction for lu@xmath3v@xmath3o@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the results for cdcr@xmath3o@xmath4  @xcite and sm@xmath3ir@xmath3o@xmath7  @xcite suggest the finite dm interaction in pyrochlore oxides .",
    "moreover , the emergence of the thermal - hall effect may support the existence of the dm interaction because the necessity of the dm interaction was shown in several previous theoretical studies  @xcite , although these theoretical studies neglected the sublattice degree of freedom in treating the dm interaction .",
    "it is important to clarify the microscopic origin of the dm interaction in pyrochlore oxides .",
    "this is because if we clarify the microscopic origin , we can understand the following four points .",
    "first , we can understand whether some components of the dm interaction are truly finite .",
    "that can not be analyzed by the phenomenological argument  @xcite because the phenomenological theory just determines the permissible components from a symmetrical point of view .",
    "on the other hand , the microscopic theory , such as moriya s microscopic theory  @xcite , determines the coefficients of the dm interaction , expressed in terms of the parameters of the noninteracting hamiltonians and the interacting hamiltonian .",
    "second , the microscopic theory can clarify how the electronic structure of pyrochlore oxides leads to the dm interaction and how the magnitude and sign of the dm interaction are controlled by tuning the parameters of the system .",
    "third , if we estimate the parameters of the noninteracting hamiltonians and the interacting hamiltonian by first - principles calculations such as the local - density approximation , we can determine the dm interaction appropriately including the material dependence of the electronic structure .",
    "fourth , if we proceed to study the phenomena that may be related to the dm interaction , we can more deeply understand the physics of those phenomena .    to clarify the microscopic origin of the dm interaction in pyrochlore oxides",
    ", we constructed a @xmath0-orbital model with the appropriate treatments of the orbital degrees of freedom , lack of the inversion center of each v - v bond , the trigonal - distortion potential , the multiorbital electron correlation , and the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , and derived the low - energy effective hamiltonian for a @xmath2 mott insulator in the similar way for moriya s microscopic theory  @xcite .",
    "we first show that due to lack of the inversion center , the indirect hopping integrals through the o @xmath17 orbitals not only modify the values of the direct hopping integrals , which are even - mirror , but also induce the odd - mirror hopping integrals , which are missing only in the direct hopping integrals .",
    "the appearance of the odd - mirror hopping integrals is a microscopic effect of lack of the inversion center .",
    "we next show the fm and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) superexchange interactions , derived by the second - order perturbation using two even - mirror hopping integrals or two odd - mirror hopping integrals . as the most important result",
    ", we show that the dm interaction arises from the mirror - mixing effect in the third - order perturbation using the combination of the even - mirror hopping integral , the odd - mirror hopping integral , and the @xmath1 coupling . in this mirror - mixing effect ,",
    "the role of those hopping integrals is to induce the antisymmetric kinetic exchange , and the role of the @xmath1 coupling is to activate the orbital angular momentum at one of two sites",
    ". those two roles are vital to get the dm - type antisymmetric exchange interactions in the weak soc because in the nonperturbed states , the orbital angular momenta are quenched and because the combination of the antisymmetries of the kinetic exchange and the orbital angular momenta of two sites is necessary . in addition , from the equation of the coefficient of the dm interaction , we deduce how to control its magnitude and sign by tuning the parameters of the model .",
    "then , we compare the present microscopic theory with the phenomenological theory  @xcite for the dm interaction in pyrochlore oxides , moriya s microscopic theory  @xcite , and the previous microscopic theory  @xcite in the strong soc , and reveal the similarities and differences .",
    "we also argue the applicability of our mechanism to the dm interaction in solids with the weak soc .    in the remaining part of this paper , we explain how to construct the appropriate @xmath0-orbital model for pyrochlore oxides , derive the low - energy effective hamiltonian for a @xmath2 mott insulator with the weak soc , discuss the correspondences between our theory and several previous theories about the dm interaction and the applicability of our mechanism , and give the summary of our achievements .",
    "the construction of the @xmath0-orbital model is explained in sec .",
    "the model consists of four hamiltonians , and the detail of each hamiltonian is explained in each of secs .",
    "ii a , ii b , ii c , and ii d , respectively . the low - energy effective hamiltonian is derived in sec .",

    "iii a , iii b 1 , and iii b 2 , respectively .",
    "the correspondences with the previous theories and the applicability are discussed in sec .",
    "we summarize our results and their meanings in sec .",
    "as an effective model of pyrochlore oxides , we introduce the following total hamiltonian , @xmath18 , with the chemical potential term , @xmath19 : @xmath20 here @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 represent the kinetic energy of the @xmath0-orbital electrons , the trigonal - distortion potential , the @xmath0-orbital hubbard interactions , the soc for the @xmath0-orbital electrons , respectively , and @xmath25 is @xmath26 with the site index @xmath27 , the orbital index @xmath28 , and the spin index @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are explicitly shown in secs .",
    "ii a , ii b , ii c , and ii d , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is so determined that the electron number per site is @xmath31 for lu@xmath3v@xmath3o@xmath7 or @xmath32 for liv@xmath3o@xmath4 for example .    in comparison with several previous theoretical studies  @xcite of the pyrochlore oxides , a new point of this effective model",
    "is an appropriate treatment of lack of the inversion center of each nearest - neighbor v - v bond , resulting in an appropriate treatment of orbital and sublattice degrees of freedom ( for the details see sec .",
    "it should be noted that although there is a previous study  @xcite about the effects of lack of the inversion center on the hopping integrals for v ions , its authors did not consider the hopping integrals between the @xmath0-orbital electrons arising from lack of the inversion center .        to derive the kinetic energy of the @xmath0-orbital electrons for pyrochlore oxides , we consider the nearest - neighbor hopping integrals for the v @xmath0 orbitals and derive these by adopting the slater - koster method  @xcite to not only the direct hoppings but also the indirect hoppings through the o @xmath17 orbitals . as we derive below ,",
    "@xmath21 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the summation between the nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath36 represents the even - mirror hopping integrals , @xmath37 , existing even with the inversion center of each nearest - neighbor v - v bond , and @xmath38 represents the odd - mirror hopping integrals , @xmath39 , appearing only with lack of the inversion center .",
    "the word `` even - mirror '' or `` odd - mirror '' mean that the mirror symmetry about the plane including the nearest - neighbor sites is even or odd , respectively ; e.g. , for a @xmath40 plane including sublattices 1 and 2 , the hopping integral between the @xmath10 orbitals is even about the mirror symmetry of the @xmath40 plane ( i.e. , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ) and the hopping integral between the @xmath8 and @xmath10 orbitals is odd because the former and latter behave like @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we first derive the contributions from the direct hoppings between nearest - neighbor v ions .",
    "we derive only the hopping integrals between v ions at sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath46 [ i.e. @xmath47 and @xmath46 in fig . [ fig1](a ) ] because the others can be obtained from these by permuting the coordinates @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , defined in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "for example , the direct hopping integrals between sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath51 are obtained by replacing @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 in the direct hopping integrals between sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath46 by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath48 , respectively , e.g. , @xmath52 . adopting the slater - koster method  @xcite to the direct hopping integrals between v ions at sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath46 , which are located at @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , we can express the hopping integrals for the @xmath0-orbital electrons in terms of three slater - koster parameters , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 : @xmath58 since all the finite direct hopping integrals are even about the mirror symmetry of the @xmath40 plane , the direct hoppings lead only to the even - mirror hopping integrals .",
    "we next derive the contributions from the indirect hoppings through the o @xmath17 orbitals .",
    "as we will show below , if we appropriately treat the effect of lack of the inversion center of each nearest - neighbor v - v bond , the indirect hoppings lead to the odd - mirror hopping integrals , which are missing in the direct hoppings .",
    "the position of the o ion of each v - o - v bond deviates from the center ; i.e. , each v - o - v angle deviates from @xmath59 [ compare figs . [ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "in addition , this deviation results in the four - sublattice structure of a tetrahedron because v ions at sublattices @xmath31 , @xmath46 , @xmath51 , and @xmath60 are different from each other ; for example , if we compare the lower layer of a tetrahedron including sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath46 with the upper layer including sublattices @xmath51 and @xmath60 , we see the difference between the v ions in the lower layer and the upper layer because the o ion for v ions of sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath46 ( sublattices @xmath51 and @xmath60 ) is located below the lower layer ( above the upper layer ) . to show that the indirect hoppings lead to the odd - mirror hopping integrals only with lack of the inversion center of each nearest - neighbor v - v bond",
    ", we consider the case in which each v - o - v angle slightly deviates from @xmath59 , i.e. , the angle is @xmath61 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] , and derive the indirect hopping integrals between v ions at sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath46 through the o ion . because of the same reason for the derivation of the direct hopping integrals , we derive only the hopping integrals between sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath46 .",
    "since the indirect nearest - neighbor hopping integrals , @xmath62 , are given by @xmath63 we need to derive the hybridizations between v @xmath0 orbitals and o @xmath17 orbitals , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for a v - o - v bond including sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath46 by using the slater - koster method  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : indirecthop ] ) , we have neglected the orbital and @xmath66 dependence of @xmath67 , the crystalline - electric - field energy difference between v @xmath0 orbitals and o @xmath17 orbitals , because this simplification is sufficient for our purpose , i.e. , showing the appearance of the odd - mirror hopping integrals .",
    "@xmath65 are obtained by adopting the slater - koster method to the indirect hopping processes between the v ion at @xmath53 and the o ion at @xmath68 with two slater - koster parameters , @xmath69 and @xmath70 : @xmath71 where the @xmath72 terms are neglected .",
    "similarly , we obtain @xmath64 : @xmath73 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vpd1])([eq : vdp9 ] ) with eq . ( [ eq : indirecthop ] ) , we obtain the indirect hopping integrals within the @xmath72 terms : @xmath74 those show that the deviation of the v - o - v angle from @xmath59 leads to @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 even if the deviation angle @xmath66 is very small .",
    "the most important difference between those hopping integrals and the others , existing even for @xmath79 , is the mirror symmetry about the @xmath40 plane including sublattices 1 and 2 : those are odd - mirror , while the others are even - mirror . from a symmetrical point of view , the odd - mirror hopping integrals are permissible only without the inversion center because the mirror mixing occurs only without the inversion center .",
    "although for not small @xmath66 , the deviation of the v - o - v angle affects not only @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 but also the other indirect ones , for the higher - order effects of @xmath66 the symmetry of the hopping integrals remains the same .",
    "thus , the above derivation is sufficient to show the appearance of the odd - mirror hopping integrals due to the indirect hoppings through the o @xmath17 orbitals under the deviation of the v - o - v angle from @xmath59 .    by combining the direct hopping integrals and the indirect ones , the kinetic energy of the @xmath0-orbital electrons for pyrochlore oxides",
    "can be described by three parameters of @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , and one parameter of @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "these parameters are related to the nearest - neighbor hopping integrals for the @xmath0-orbital electrons .",
    "for example , those relations for the plane including sublattices @xmath31 and @xmath46 are given by @xmath84 those relations are more easily seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . by choosing @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 appropriately , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hke ] ) can describe the kinetic energy for any pyrochlore oxides as long as the main orbitals for low - energy excitations are the @xmath0 orbitals .     and",
    "( b ) the odd - mirror hoppings of @xmath38 for the nearest - neighbor v ions between sublatices @xmath31 and @xmath46 and the corresponding values .",
    "the color differences represent the sign differences of the wave function . ,",
    "width=317 ]      the effect of the trigonal distortion on the @xmath0-orbital electrons can be described by @xmath22 , @xmath85 by diagonalizing @xmath22 , we rewrite @xmath22 as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the effect of the trigonal distortion is splitting the energy level of the @xmath0-orbital electron into the singlet @xmath11 orbital and the doublet @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbitals , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "since the @xmath11 orbital is the lower state for liv@xmath3o@xmath4 and lu@xmath3v@xmath3o@xmath7 at low temperature , @xmath91 is realized for these pyrochlore vanadates . in principle",
    ", we can switch the lower state from the @xmath11 orbital to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbitals by controlling the trigonal distortion .",
    "if we express @xmath36 and @xmath38 in terms of the creation and annihilation operators for the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 orbitals , we find the important difference between the even - mirror and the odd - mirror hopping integrals .",
    "namely , the even - mirror hopping integrals for the @xmath0 orbitals are expressed as the intraorbital and the interorbital hopping integrals for the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 orbitals , while the odd - mirror hopping integrals for the @xmath0 orbitals are expressed as the interorbital hopping integrals for the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 orbitals .",
    "those properties for the even - mirror and the odd - mirror hopping integrals are seen from , respectively , the intraorbital hopping integrals for the @xmath8 orbital between sublattice @xmath46 at @xmath92 and subltattice @xmath31 at @xmath93 , @xmath94 and the odd - mirror hopping integrals between sublattice @xmath46 at @xmath92 and subltattice @xmath31 at @xmath93 , @xmath95 understanding this difference is useful to understand the physical meaning of the finite contributions in the low - energy effective hamiltonian ( e.g. , see figs . [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "@xmath23 is given by four multiorbital hubbard interactions , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 : @xmath100 where @xmath101 represents the restricted summation , @xmath102 or @xmath103 or @xmath104 for @xmath105 or @xmath9 or @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "these four parameters reduce to two , @xmath96 and @xmath98 , if we use @xmath106 and @xmath107 .    for the derivations of the low - energy effective hamiltonian of the @xmath2 mott insulator in sec .",
    "iii , we rewrite @xmath23 in terms of the irreducible representations of the @xmath108 states , where two electrons exist per site : @xmath109 here @xmath110 represents the irreducible representations , @xmath111 represents the degeneracy , @xmath112 are given by @xmath113 and @xmath114 are @xmath115 with @xmath116      @xmath24 is given by the atomic soc , the so - called @xmath1 coupling , of the @xmath0-orbital electrons : @xmath117 with @xmath118 , the coupling constant , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 for @xmath122 , and @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath1 coupling is appropriate to take account of the soc of electrons in solid .",
    "this is because the soc of electrons arises from the relativistic effect near the nucleus , i.e. the correction to the nonrelativistic treatment is necessary only when an electron approaches the nucleus .",
    "actually , we can describe even the antisymmetric soc for an inversion - symmetry - broken quasi - two - dimensional system near a surface or an interface by using @xmath24 and the appropriate hopping - integral terms such as @xmath38  @xcite ; this successful description holds not only for the effective single - orbital system , which is sufficiently described by a rashba - type soc  @xcite , but also the @xmath0-orbital system , which is not described by the rashba - type soc .",
    "the key to the successful description is the appropriate treatment of orbital degrees of freedom of the soc and the kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath24 causes not only the interorbital excitations for the @xmath0 orbitals but also the excitations between the @xmath11 orbital and the @xmath12 or @xmath13 orbitals .",
