    "state and parameter estimation as well as model validation are frequently used in many applications with different requirements .",

    "probabilistic estimation methods take data on the moments of probability densities into account and allow the estimation of probability densities and therefore probabilistic statements on model validity .",
    "this work presents initial steps toward a combination of set- and moment - based data into a consistent framework for estimation and model validation of nonlinear ( polynomial ) , continuous - time systems . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the presented framework has not been considered in this context before .",
    "however , numerous other methods addressing similar problems exist in the literature and several of them will be reviewed briefly below . due to space limitations ,",

    "in contrast , the initial setup considered in this paper is not stochastic in the sense that the time evolution of the moments is modeled via the liouville equation .",
    "this equation reformulates nonlinear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) , with the help of occupation measures , into a linear partial differential equation to describe the time evolution of the density of the solution of the ode .",

    "are found in @xcite and in the references therein . in the subsequent subsections , prob .  1 and 2 are addressed and the results are illustrated for simple examples .      the approach can be summarized as follows .",
    "the original deterministic nonlinear dynamics , given by , is reformulated in the space of nonnegative measures .",

    "these probability measures encode the nonlinear dynamics on the time interval @xmath28 $ ] and allow the consideration of uncertainties by averaging over space and time which also eliminates the nonlinear expressions .",
    "furthermore , they are linked by pointwise - in - time probability measures @xmath66 and @xmath67 via liouville s equation : @xmath68 which allows deriving linear constraints as shown below . here , liouville s equation is written in its variational form , for all monomials @xmath69 .",
    "note that the monomials are a dense basis for the set of continuous functions on compact sets .",
    "liouville s equation is a linear partial differential equation which accounts for the time - evolution of probability measures ruled by the nonlinear continuous - time dynamics .",
    "note that if the initial conditions are certain ( i.e.points for fixed @xmath27 and hence a dirac probability distribution ) , liouville s equation describes the evolution of the test function @xmath70 along the trajectory .",
    "this reformulation in terms of occupation measures results in a system of a finite number of linear constraints in an infinite - dimensional space , which links all the moments @xmath71 of the occupation measures @xmath65 and the moments @xmath72 of the measure @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , respectively . in case of the probability measure @xmath66 ,",
    "the moments are related to the test functions @xmath70 by @xmath75 and similar for the other probability measures .",
    "let us denote the resulting infinite - dimensional linear system of equations by @xmath76 .",
    "the obtained set of equations can be extended by equations constraining the support of the probability measures ( cf.set-based uncertainties ) , and by enforcing constraints on the moments of the probability measures thereby including data on the moments ( cf.probabilistic uncertainties ) . for a measure to be supported on a semi - algebraic set",
    ", the infinite - dimensional vectors of moments @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath71 have to fulfill necessary and sufficient conditions .",
    "these are formulated by infinite - dimensional convex linear matrix inequalities ( lmi ) called moment matrices that we express by @xmath79 to guarantee positivity of the measures .",
    "furthermore , the matrices necessary to account for the support are called localizing matrices and are denoted by @xmath80 , where the @xmath81 are polynomials .",
    "the matrices @xmath82 are symmetric , square matrices whose rows and columns are indexed by the monomials @xmath70 ( cf.eq .  ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath83 are similar to @xmath82 , but their elements are additionally multiplied by the polynomial @xmath81",
    ".    the resulting infinite - dimensional decision problem can be solved by a converging hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations or sum - of - squares restrictions .",
    "this then allows determining an outer approximation of the moments and initial conditions ( cf.prob .",
    "[ prob : mom_estim ] and 2 ) .",
    "if we truncate the infinite sequence of moments to moments of degree up to @xmath15 , we obtain a finite - dimensional linear system of equations that we denote by @xmath84 , as well as truncated finite - dimensional lmi constraints @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "note that these constraints are necessary for the corresponding measures to be supported on a semi - algebraic set . by construction ,",
    "minimization ( resp .",
    "maximization ) of an entry of the vectors @xmath88 or @xmath89 on the resulting finite - dimensional convex set yields a valid lower ( resp .",
    "upper ) bound on the corresponding moment . when increasing the truncation degree @xmath15 ( also called relaxation order )",
    ", we obtain a monotonically nondecreasing ( resp .",
    "nonincreasing ) sequence of lower ( resp .",
    "upper ) bounds that converge to the exact value of the moment consistent with the uncertain set - based and moment - based measurement data .    to address prob .  1 and 2 and to recover local , non - averaged information in time and space , a discretization is needed , which still allows guaranteed outer approximations .",
    "this is explained in the following subsections .      as in @xcite",
    "we split the global occupation measure time - wise into local occupation measures @xmath90 corresponding to time intervals @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath91 . for the upper bound on a moment @xmath92 , this then gives the following moment relaxation of order @xmath15 : @xmath93 where @xmath81 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 are polynomials from and , respectively .",
    "the matrices @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the truncated moment and localizing matrices , respectively , depending linearly on moment vectors of the respective degrees .",

    "are shown .",
    "the green and red lines correspond to the lower and upper bound , respectively .",
    "the pointwise - in - time estimates were connected by lines to guide the eye .",
    "estimates for the first moment are not shown but the estimates are even tighter . ]",
    "this section addresses prob .",
    "[ prob : minv ] , which is approached similar as the pointwise - in - time estimations of the moments .",
    "however , instead of splitting the occupation measure in time , the measure of interest ( e.g.the initial measure @xmath104 ) is split in space , which gives different measures supported on the different subdomains and which are linked by liouville s equation .",
    "to estimate the lower and upper bounds on the probability masses over the subdomains , the @xmath58 moment of the corresponding measure is minimized and maximized , respectively . as above , the infinite - dimensional decision problem can be relaxed by a converging hierarchy of semidefinite programs , cf.eq .  .",
