    "[ sec1 ]    the epitaxial lateral overgrowth ( elo ) and selective area epitaxy ( sag ) are commonly used to grow micro - scale semiconductor crystals and thin films .",
    "the micrometer - scale selective growth is well - achievable by chemical vapor deposition or liquid phase epitaxy @xcite-@xcite ; the elo and sag can be used also to grow nanostructures by the molecular beam epitaxy @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , the mathematical models that allow to numerically study the elo and sag from vapor @xcite - @xcite were introduced .",
    "these continuum , geometric crystal growth models are formulated as free - boundary problems in two dimensions ( that is , normal to the substrate / mask and normal to the axis of long stripe openings etched in the mask ) and , therefore , they are capable of explicitly accounting for the mask topography and the interface anisotropy .",
    "the crystal growth is by the normal flux of particles from the vapor phase to the interface ; the surface diffusion redistributes the material along the interface during the growth .",
    "evaporation - recondensation from both the mask surface and crystal - vapor interface , and the diffusion of adatoms along the mask surface to the tri - junction crystal - mask - vapor are accounted for by the models .",
    "the details of the formulation , boundary conditions and numerical method can be found in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we only address issues related to the mask surface modeling and the crystal interaction with the edge of the mask ( mask corner point ) .",
    "note that the crystal growth out of the trench occurs relatively early in the elo process ; however , our previous modeling suggests @xcite that the perturbation introduced to the crystal - vapor interface by the edge of the mask exists for a long time after the actual interaction of the advancing edge of a crystal ( contact line ) and the mask edge took place .",
    "thus it seems important to understand the details of the contact line motion over the edge .    in @xcite",
    "the treatment of the contact line motion relies on the assumptions of ( a ) the thermodynamic equilibrium at the tri - junction ( indeed , sag and elo are equilibrium processes ) , ( b ) the mask surface as the rectangular , macroscopic step , and ( c ) the mask as the energetically homogeneous surface : the mask - vapor surface energy @xmath1 the assumptions ( b ) and ( c ) limit the ability of any model to describe the overgrowth of the crystal line from the vertical onto the horizontal part of the mask . indeed , ( a ) implies that the equilibrium contact angle @xmath2 is given by the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energies of the crystal - mask and crystal - vapor interfaces , respectively ( see appendix a ) .",
    "then , ( c ) together with the natural assumptions of constant ( at the tri - junction ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 imply that @xmath2 is a constant value at the mask .",
    "however , due to ( b ) the mask edge is a singular point in the sense that the contact angle is not well defined there . in @xcite ,",
    "this situation was dealt with by instant readjustment of the interface @xmath6 @xmath7-axis angle ( angle of the tangent , @xmath8 ) to a new value once the contact point reaches the mask edge to preserve the equilibrium constant angle @xmath2 .",
    "such instant readjustment causes the short unphysical retraction of the contact point into the vapor phase and influences the shape of the interface . ] where @xmath9 is the arc length along the curve ( crystal - vapor interface ) . ] in this paper we make an attempt to model the overgrowth event self - consistently by approximating the mask edge by a circular arc and restricting the contact point to movement along this arc .",
    "we numerically study the limit of zero arc radius .",
    "since in applications the mask is often a crystalline solid itself , we allow for the anisotropy of @xmath10 and thus , by virtue of ( [ 1.3 ] ) , for the variable @xmath2 along the mask .",
    "( quartz or tungsten masks are common @xcite .",
    "sometimes a mask is not deposited at all , but the long stripes are etched in the crystalline gaas or sapphire substrate itself @xcite .",
    "the long crystalline mesas left on a surface of a substrate in this latter case are more advantageous for the epitaxy of some semiconductor materials than the geometrically equivalent mesas of the foreign ( to the substrate ) mask material . )    apart from the interest to this problem that stems from the elo technology , there is a broad class of phenomena in which the material - defect interaction is a key component .",
    "for instance , when liquid wets the microscopically rough surface the contact line gets pinned on surface asperities and thus becomes unstable .",
    "the latter problem , both for a single asperity and for the random ensemble of asperities has been studied intensively from a physico - mechanical standpoint ; see , for instance , recent works @xcite and the review article by de gennes @xcite .",
    "the somewhat different situation where the surface defect is the macroscopic , organized structure was considered , for example , by oliver _",
    "_ in @xcite . in that work , the defect is the edge of a solid disk that supports the liquid drop on its top .",
    "the pinning effect of the edge has been examined theoretically and gibbs inequality condition for the equilibrium of a drop bound by the edge has been confirmed experimentally .",
    "also , the various conditions for drop stability at the edge have been examined .",
    "authors used a circular sapphire disk with the 90@xmath11 edge and the aluminum disks with the edges subtending a range of angles . in @xcite , the finite element stability analysis of an inclined pendant drop",
    "was performed , as well as the experiment .",
    "the latter showed that both the contact line and the contact angle can adjust _ around _ the capillary until the young - laplace equation that balances the capillary pressure with pressure forces due to gravity @xcite is satisfied . in @xcite , the asymptotic solution to the model of the contact line pinning on a single",
    ", macroscopic spherical defect was derived .",
    "however , our bibliography search for the study in which the direct numerical tracking of the contact line motion over the defect is performed was unsuccessful .",
    "obviously , the elo problem for the homoepitaxial crystal is simpler than any similar problem involving a liquid , since there is at least no need to solve the young - laplace equation .",
    "heteroepitaxial and thermal stresses , if present in a solid - on - solid system , may significantly complicate the analysis , but they usually are incapable of modifying the equilibrium contact angle determined by the interfacial energies alone @xcite ( however , as is well known , they may alter the dynamics of the free surface of a solid film ) .",
    "the latter in the case of the sag was demonstrated in @xcite , where the morphological evolution of a heteroepitaxial thin film growing on a patterned substrate was studied by the phase - field method .",
    "[ sec2 ]    the figure [ fig1 ] shows the problem geometry .",
    "as was already noted , the length of the open , unmasked stripes is assumed much larger than their widths since large aspect ratios are common in the applications ; thus , the 2d crystal growth model can be used .",

    "is used to phenomenologically explain pinning ( pages 836 - 38 ) , the total pinning force exerted by the defect on the line is such that graphs of this force and the restoring linear elastic force ( _ vs. _ position on a defect ) are not intersecting , and thus there is no equilibrium , pinning line position(s ) on a defect .",
