    "our dft results summarized in fig .  [ fig : dft - interaction_energy ] show the same behavior : for @xmath47 we obtain a stable h@xmath44-bond at a bond length comparable to the bond length of a hydrogen molecule in vacuo , but with a much smaller binding energy .",
    "this result is not sensitive with respect to the approximation applied to the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "also the more technical effect of the restricted k - point sampling can be read from the figure . comparing again to the lqhd results of shukla and eliasson , it is obvious that the interaction energy minimum found in the _ ab initio _ data is not included in their approach .",
    "thus , the se screened proton potential has , for small densities ( e.g.  @xmath50 ) , a qualitatively incorrect shape , in particular it completely misses the molecular bound state .    for larger density , i.  e.  for @xmath52 , fig .",
    "[ fig : dft - interaction_energy ] shows that the minimum in our simulations becomes very shallow or vanishes at all , within the accuracy of the numerical dft computations .",
    "similarly , we do not resolve extremely shallow ( below @xmath63mev ) binding potentials at larger distances from the proton , such as the ones related to friedel oscillations .",
    "these oscillations could be reproduced by dft using a substantial computational effort .",
    "however , there is no need for this since such extremely small features of the potential are expected to be of no relevance for all dense plasma applications since they always encounter a finite electron temperature of at least one ev .",
    "the approach by se in ref .",
    "@xcite starts from the assumption that the ions are immobile and embedded into a neutralizing background ( see eq .",
    "( 3 ) in ref .",
    "we have thus used dft , together with the lda or the pbe - gga @xcite applied to the exchange - correlation energy functional , to calculate the interaction energy of two protons immersed in a jellium background , without any further approximation applied to the quantum - mechanical problem . for the reliability of the dft as compared to quantum monte carlo simulations we refer e.g. to ref .",
    "thus the dft results can serve as a reference to evaluate the accuracy of the interaction potential as derived from the lqhd approach by se @xcite .    as shown from the comparison to ab initio dft simulations",
    ", the se potential completely misses the bound states of protons in low temperature hydrogen .",
    "when the density is increased the deviations between lqhd and dft potentials become smaller but are still noticeable .    yet even at higher densities where no molecules exist the se potential is qualitatively wrong because it does not show an attractive minimum for @xmath64 at all .",
    "dielectric theories of the electron gas and electron liquid including correlations in the frame of local field corrections , however , confirm that friedel oscillations persist up to high densities , e.g. @xcite . the present lqhd model of se also misses the friedel oscillations , as the authors themselves underline .    furthermore , we consider two limiting cases of the lqhd potential discussed by se @xcite : first , in the limit @xmath65 se recover a yukawa potential with the screening length @xmath4 .",
    "this is correct for high densities , @xmath66 , but not for low densities , @xmath67 where @xmath65 as well , cf .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "second , se recover , for @xmath68 , the exponential cosine - screened coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "this limit is questionable since @xmath21 can not exceed @xmath69 , cf .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "these failures rule out any reliable predictions such as novel potential minima . besides , the extremely low value of the associated binding energy ( cf .",
    "[ fig : phi_min ] ) would require a particularly accurate theory and careful verification .",
    "finally , let us analyze possible reasons for the failure of the linearized qhd model in application to dense two - component plasmas .",
    "i. : :    as any fluid theory , lqhd can not resolve distances below some cut - off    @xmath70 . this has been pointed out by manfredi and    co - workers @xcite who performed a test of a 1d version of nonlinear    qhd for thin metal films @xcite .",
    "ii . : :    shukla and eliasson note @xcite that qhd is valid only for    @xmath71 , i.e. for weak    coupling .",
    "this range is indicated by the shaded area in    fig .  [",
    "fig : alpha ] .",
    "since the present model of lqhd contains exchange    and correlation contributions , this range may actually be larger    @xcite .",
    "iii . : :    linearized qhd fails when the linearization conditions are violated ,    i.e. when the perturbed density is comparable with the unperturbed    density which is common in the description of strong attractive    interactions .",
    "while item ( ii ) is presently open and requires further analysis , our dft simulation results allow us to directly verify ( i. ) . in a hydrodynamic description of classical plasmas",
    "the smallest length scale that can be resolved is the debye length .",
    "similarly , in the quantum case , this cut - off is expected to be of the order of the thomas - fermi length , @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , re - examining the dft and lqhd data for the screened proton potential in fig .",
    "[ fig : dft - electrostatic_potential ] we observe that the most dramatic deviations occur on length scales smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "thus we confirm that lqhd can not , by construction , yield potentials with atomic - scale resolution in a dense quantum plasma @xcite .    yet",
    "the most severe limitation is , apparantly , related to the linearization of the qhd equations , item ( iii ) .",
    "in fact , similar linear response calculations for a proton in a degenerate electron gas have been done long ago .",
    "almbladh et al .",
    "@xcite have performed density functional calculations and compared them to a linearized version of dft ( which , by construction , is essentially more accurate than any hydrodynamic approach ) .",
    "they observed a complete failure of the linear theory in the prediction of the electron density screening the proton .",
    "not only is the electron density at the proton a factor @xmath74 to @xmath75 ( for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively ) too small , but linear theory generally predicted friedel oscillations to occur at much too high distances from the proton .",
    "thus , a possible explanation for the potential minimum observed in the present linearized qhd , cf . fig .  [ fig : pot_se ] , is that it is a trace of the friedel oscillations ( the first minimum ) that is displaced to higher distances from the proton due to the linearization , cf . also fig .  [ fig : r_min ] .",
    "it would , therefore , be interesting to test this hypothesis by comparing the lqhd results of se to full nonlinear qhd .",
    "let us assume for a moment that the attractive potential of se would be a real effect and consider its implications for proton crystallization @xcite . to this end ,",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_min ] the location of the potential minimum and compare it to the mean interparticle distance for a given density .",
    "it is obvious that there is a striking mismatch .",
    "even if the system would be at zero temperature protons could not occupy the minimum locations simply because their density is several orders of magnitude too high ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : pot_se ] where the mean interparticle distance is marked on the se potential ) , making such a state energetically impossible .",
    "we thus have to conclude , based on dft simulations and general considerations about the location and low depth of the potential minimum , that the predictions of se of novel attractive forces , novel ion lattices , atoms , molecules , critical points and phase transitions in dense hydrogen are invalid .",
