    "wolfram weise , a long - time collaborator of gerry s , came up to me after my talk at the meeting and said `` write exactly as you spoke '' .",
    "i will try to recollect what i said about gerry during the meeting .",
    "my association with gerry began in 1980 at the niels bohr institute ( nbi ) in copenhagen . through jakob bondorf",
    ", gerry had learned that i was spending most of my meagre danish international development agency s ( danida ) scholarship money calling my wife manju , who was a physics graduate student in columbia university , ny . from the front bench - during a traditional monday morning seminar at the nbi - gerry passed to me , in a rear bench , a yellow sheet of paper .",
    "the first sentence in his note offered me a post - doc position , and the second sentence instructed me to contact the administrator of the nuclear theory group at stony brook university , sydel blumberg .",
    "it was signed , gerry brown .",
    "i was astounded !",
    "i later learned that he was the supervisory editor of nuclear physics a and read everything that was submitted to the journal .",
    "i had written a paper with shalom shlomo on wigner distribution functions of nuclei , and gerry had chosen nandor balaz , an expert on the subject , as the referee of our manuscript .",
    "gerry s comment was `` if you can pass through nandor , you must be ok . ''",
    "little did i know then that he had plans for me .",
    "i came to stony brook in the summer of 1981 and was put up at the sunwood estate .",
    "i had no car , so i walked everyday to the physics department and then back to the `` golden cage '' at sunwood .",
    "gerry was at the nbi telling hans bethe what to work on ( supernovae , i later learned ) .",
    "i gave my first talk on `` phase space distributions of time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) collisons '' to experimentalists in the basement of the physics building .",
    "my talk , which aage bohr and ben mottelson had liked at the nbi , was a disaster at stony brook !",
    "i thought no one cared . the ever smiling and always kind linwood lee was my host , and made me feel that i was doing something useful and that i would be alright at stony brook .    with few people to talk to ( post - docs jochen wambach , berndt schewizinger , and rudolf fiebig being busy with their own work ) ,",
    "i started a collaboration with john alexander ( of the chemistry department ) and rich friefelder ( a physics graduate student doing experiments ) on fission fragment angular distributions ( of which i knew something from my ph.d .",
    "jochen kindly rented me a room in his house at 295 sheep pasture road , which was less far to the department than sunwood .",
    "as i was getting somewhat settled , sydel passed on a message from gerry that i was to give a talk at mit and i was to contact john negele about my visit to mit .",
    "the man was devious !",
    "nervous as i was , i went to mit , gave my talk , and was not seriously hurt - john was a kind host .",
    "gerry returned to stony brook in the fall , and was furiously at work on core - collapse supernovae , the little - bag model , skyrmions , fermi liquid theory , etc . to me , he said `` you do too much numerical work ( tdhf ) , start thinking ! '' he knew how to get under my skin .",
    "so i wrote a paper on `` effective masses in nuclei and the level density parameter '' with jochen wambach and mrs .",
    "ma ( a chinese visitor ) using only a calculator .",
    "the emphasis was on delineating the roles of the @xmath0-mass and the @xmath1-mass .",
    "i recall claude mahaux , editor of physics letters b , liking this paper .",
    "gerry just nodded .",
    "graduate students jerry cooperstein ( coop ) and eddie baron , professors jim lattimer and amos yahil , and post - doc adam burrows , and hans bethe , through his daily faxes , all working on supernova explosions , consumed gerry s time to a great extent .",
    "he had me working on sub - threshold pion production , a topical subject at the time , but we were not satisfied with the results ( not a large enough cross section for his taste ) .",
    "a little later , i worked with peter braun - munzinger and johanna stachel using a different approach .",
    "we wrote a few papers together and got to know each other very well . watching the excitement of the supernova gang , i asked him to give me a supernova - related project to work on .",
    "he said `` you re doing very well on your own ; i do nt have to worry about you .",
    "leave me alone . ''",
    "end of conversation .",
    "so i was just hanging around , helping coop , eddie , and karen kohlemainen ( lattimer s student ) when i could .",
    "things turned around for me one day , when gerry asked me to come to his house for morning coffee .",
    "the entire supernova gang was there .",
    "gerry was fussing around hans bethe trying to make him comfortable .",
    "reams of computer outputs from stan woosely were on the kitchen - cum - dining room table .",
    "bethe started writing on a stand - up black board and said something about which adam burrows from the end of the room said `` that s manifest nonsense ! '' .",
    "utter silence in the room .",
    "i distinctly recall gerry s death - stare at adam .",
    "bethe paused , said he would be right back , and went to the bath room .",
    "we could all hear the toilet flush .",
    "he came back and said to adam `` you re right '' .",
    "i was ecstatic !",
    "i thought , this is the place for me ; i could say anything i wanted . since then , adam and i have talked to each other a lot , but never wrote a paper together , although we were toying with the idea of writing a book on `` fun with fermi integrals '' , as we both had several analytical results not found easily in the literature at the time .",
    "we talked at this meeting about it and decided that time was long past for the book .      for several years",
    ", gerry invited me and my wife to thanksgiving and christmas dinners .",
    "it was only when i said that i wanted to learn how to cook these dinners myself that we were reluctantly let off . among others ,",
    "peter , johanna , and i took turns playing tennis doubles with gerry and his wife betty .",
    "playing them was no easy task as both of them towered over the net , and gerry was particularly competitive .",
    "he would call me up on new year s eve and wanted to play tennis at 9 p.m. or so . when i complained that i was having a party at my house",
    ", he would say `` never mind , come over .",
    "you ll enjoy your drinks better later . ''",
    "so , i went and played .",
    "he had given me a new tennis racquet so i could play him better .",
    "gerry often killed me with his kindness .",
    "he would come over with a problem or a new paper , and say `` you seem to know this .",
    "tell me all about it .",
    "no rush , tomorrow coffee - time will do '' , and just walk away .",
    "i knew nothing of what he was talking about .",
    "the man was devious !",
    "i would study all night , come to work and hide in a corner of the library hoping he would forget . no chance !",
    "he always found me no matter where i sat in the library , put his hands on my shoulders from the back and say , `` let s go talk '' .",
    "i havent met anyone who could put people together to attack a problem as well as gerry .",
    "he had me working with kevin bedell , jim lattimer ( who became a long - term collaborator ) , jean - paul blaizot , wolfram weise , manque rho , subal das gupta , etc . , in addition to many students and post - docs ( i got to write papers with most of them ) .",
    "the number of people in this audience is a testimony to his `` match - making '' ability , as eddie has already pointed out .",
    "kevin , who lived in the same apartment complex as i did , taught me tennis and fermi liquid theory ( we wrote a paper together on the `` incompressibility of neutron - rich matter '' ) , and even sold me his car .",
    "gerry was also open to suggestions .",
    "i mentioned to him that it would be nice to have subal das gupta visit us so we could work on the momentum - dependence of the nuclear equation of state to be used in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "subal was invited to spend his sabbatical year at stony brook , which proved very productive .",
    "later , charles gale , subal s student , also spent a part of his sabbatical at stony brook .",
    "when i told him that achim schwenk would benefit from working with bengt friman at gsi , it was a done deal .      provoking people was gerry s favorite past time .",
    "he would often startle me in my office ( you could never tell when he would be coming as he walked silently for such a big man ) with `` it s unbelievably beautiful '' .",
    "when i asked him what was beautiful , he would expound at length on something he had thought up the night before .",
    "i often thought it was outrageous , but always remembered manque s advise to me , `` gerry s starting point is always right , his conclusions are always right , for everything in between you re on your own '' .",
    "it took me quite a while to realize that gerry was deliberately goading me .",
    "i slowly learned how to deal with it .",
    "i had him write it down for me , which he always did .",
    "then , i would work out the problem his way and my way , and give him notes on both approaches .",
    "it took him time to abandon his method when wrong , but my system generally worked .",
    "knowing fully well that i had played professional cricket in india , he deliberately did not tell me that john millener at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) was an excellent cricketer ( an oxford blue ) , and that bnl had a decent cricket team .",
    "devious again !",
    "i ended up playing for a gay soft - ball team at stony brook .",
    "we even reached the finals as no other team would play us because it was a gay team .",
    "the news got published in the local newspapers .",
    "gerry s reaction was `` i did nt bring you here from copenhagen to learn americana !",
    "get to serious work . ''",
    "eventually , i met john at a nancy and ernie warburton s party , and we played many games together at bnl , oyster park , and staten island where the `` carribean cricketers '' would try to intimidate us .",
    "we won some and lost some , but were not intimidated .",
    "i once asked gerry for some guidance on the axial coupling constant @xmath2 in medium , as he had worked on it before .",
    "he said `` my dear boy , every theoretical physicist worth his salt must write a paper on @xmath2 . i ve paid my dues to @xmath2 .",
    "you re on your own '' .",
    "he altogether refused to help me .",
    "when i handed him my paper with greg carter , he said `` nice '' .",
    "that was nice !",
    "i know that i lost my temper with gerry sometimes .",
    "but , gerry was always kind to me . for reasons entirely unknown to me , he believed in me .",
    "genuine concern for all students and post - docs was always in evidence with gerry .",
    "he helped them financially when needed , often from his own pocket when things could not be arranged otherwise .",
    "he talked with them at length about their life and arranged help with his many contacts .",
    "as supervisory editor of physics letters b and nuclear physics a , he accepted many papers for publication even when he , or the referees , disapproved of their contents .",
    "his take was `` let people in the field decide '' .",
    "he gave full credit to my work with lattimer on what might have happened with sn 1987a .",
    "the so - called brown - bethe scenario that the neutron star there might have become a black hole was generously credited as the prakash - lattimer scenario in his talks on the subject .",
    "being a passionate lover of physics who never stopped doing physics , he encouraged others to be the same .",
    "the number of times he called me at home to talk physics is uncountable .",
    "he regularly called me late at night to talk physics even when i moved to ohio .",
    "he dearly wanted to write a paper with me on @xmath3 , even after his papers with jeremy holt , but unfortunately that never came to pass .",
    "not surprisingly , the research of many of us trained at the nuclear theory group in stony brook has centered around topics that were dear to gerry . here , i ll highlight the research of gerry s wards that have made news along with topics that puzzle me and others in the field of neutron stars .",
    "the discovery of well - measured neutron star masses @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite has caused quite a stir among theorists .",

    "i list below a few puzzles that bother many including me .",
    "there is no news of a neutron star in sn 1987a .",
    "how long does it take for a neutron star to be revealed after a core - collapse supernova explosion ?",
    "did sn 1987a end up as a black hole ?",
    "if so , was it upon fall - back accretion ( brown - bethe scenario @xcite ) , or , after the deleptonization stage ( prakash - lattimer scenario @xcite ) ?          in order to account for the measured cooling curves of neutron stars , the `` minimal cooling '' paradigm excludes _ a priori _ all possible fast @xmath56-emission mechanisms , thus restricting @xmath56-emission to the  standard \" mu process and the similar nucleon bremsstrahlung processes  @xcite .",
    "however , effects of nucleon pairing , i.e. , neutron superfluidity and/or proton superconductivity , are included . while successful in explaining the data for the most part , several cases @xcite fall below the `` minimal cooling '' paradigm ( see fig .",
    "[ coldies ] ) and point to enhanced cooling , if these objects correspond to neutron stars .",
    "do these objects contain neutron stars or black holes ?",
    "how fast can neutron stars spin ?",
    "general relativistic calculations of rapid rotation give an upper limit to the neutron star spin frequency @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the non - rotating maximum mass spherical configurations , and the second relation refers to a mass not too close to the maximum mass .",
    "effects of general relativity being the largest for the most compact configurations ( largest @xmath60 values ) , sub - millisecond rotation is of much interest . the observed distribution of neutron star spins in low - mass x - ray binaries is shown in fig .",
    "[ spins ] .",
    "the puzzle is , there is a sharp cutoff for spins above 730 hz well below the theoretically allowed upper limit .",
    "can gravitational radiation from rapidly rotating pulsars undergoing accretion limit their spin up ?",
    "this possibility is being explored by many in the field .",
    "the sites and the manner in which elements heavier than iron are made in our universe have been longstanding puzzles .",
    "candidate sites are the far suburbs of where core - collapse supernova explosions and neutron star mergers occur .",
    "conditions suitable for rapid neutron capture processes to occur in the aftermath of a supernova explosion are yet to be realized in simulations .",
    "the recent observations of a kilonova event @xcite in the short gamma - ray burst of grb 130603b have rejuvenated interest in binary neutron star mergers in the context of heavy element synthesis .",
    "lattimer s thesis work in the mid 1970 s @xcite laid the ground for thinking about binary star mergers as a site for synthesizing heavy elements .",
    "i hope he gets rewarded when this puzzle is solved !",
