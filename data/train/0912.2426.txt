    "axisymmetric spacetimes has been studied mainly for two reasons .",
    "the first one is that they often appear in astrophysical models like rotating stars and black holes .",
    "the second is because in the presence of any symmetry einstein equations simplify considerable and hence these spacetimes are useful as intermediate step to understand more complex problems . in particular ,",
    "axially symmetric gravitational waves in vacuum do not carry angular momentum , this represents an important simplification in the dynamics .",
    "also , axial symmetry is the only symmetry compatible with asymptotic flatness and non - trivial gravitational radiation @xcite . from this perspective , axially symmetric gravitational waves are the simplest possible waves emitted from isolated sources .",
    "and hence they represent the natural candidates to study the strong field dynamics of gravitational waves in einstein equations .",
    "however , axial symmetry presents a major difficulty . to take advantage of the symmetry",
    "an adapted coordinate system should be used in order to reduce the field equations to a lower - dimensional system ( there is a well known procedure to do this for any symmetry in a geometrical way @xcite , we review this result in sec . [",
    "sec : symmetry - reduction ] ) .",
    "the problem is that the norm of the axial killing vector vanishes at the axis , and hence the reduced equations are formally singular there .",
    "this difficulty is so severe that until recently axially symmetric spacetimes have not been studied in detail even using numerical techniques ( see chapter 10.4 in @xcite and references therein ) . in a number of recent articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite this kind of singular behavior has been successfully implemented numerically .",
    "there is however no analytical study of axial symmetry in the dynamical regime ( see the review article @xcite for results for other kind of symmetries ) .",
    "in fact , it can be argued that this singular behavior near the axis is so complicated that the axially symmetric case is as hard as the full general case from the analytical point of view .",
    "there exists however a new ingredient that makes , in our opinion , the problem worth studying . in the article @xcite",
    "it has been proved that there exists a gauge in axial symmetry such that the total mass of the spacetime can be written as a positive definite volume integral over the spacelike slices of the foliation . moreover ,",
    "this integral is conserved along the evolution . this conserved integral control the norm of the fields along the whole evolution .",
    "this is certainly a very desirable property of this gauge which is not present in the general , non - symmetric , case .",
    "also , this mass integral formula appears to be connected with stability properties of black holes in axial symmetry @xcite .",
    "the gauge mentioned above is a combination of the well known maximal condition for the lapse and the choice of isothermal coordinates ( also called quasi isotropical ) for the shift .",
    "the later condition is only possible in axial symmetry .",
    "we call it the maximal - isothermal gauge .",
    "this gauge has been known for long time ( see @xcite and @xcite ) but without noticing this property of the mass .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that this gauge is the one used in most of the recent numerical computations @xcite @xcite @xcite@xcite ( examples of other gauge choices in axial symmetry are given in @xcite @xcite ) . that is , this gauge has not only desirable analytical properties but it is also useful for numerical studies .",
    "the very basic question of well - posedness of the equations in this gauge is open .",
    "this question is rather subtle because of the singular behavior mentioned above .",
    "the standard theory in partial differential equations does not seems to apply in a direct way .",
    "this is the problem we want to study in this article . in order to do this",
    ", the first step is to study the linearization of the equation around fixed solutions .",
    "we chose minkowski as a background for simplicity .",
    "as we describe in the next section , we obtain a remarkable simple system of linear equation together with a conserved quantity which corresponds to the mass of the spacetime up to second - order corrections .",
    "this system allows us to formulate the problem of well - posedness in a simplified setting which is nevertheless relevant and physically interesting . remarkably enough , even for this linear system the well - posedness appears to be a nontrivial problem . in order to get insight into this problem we numerically evolve these equations to provide evidences that the system is in fact well - posed and that the solutions have the expected behavior .    if the local existence problem is so complicated in this gauge one can wonder what can be said about the global behavior of the evolution , which is , of course , the ultimate goal . however , many of the main complications of this gauge are already present in the well - posedness problem because they are related with the local behavior of the fields at the symmetry axis .",
    "if one can solve them at the linearized level in a satisfactory way there is a good chance that the mass integral formula can be used to control the global evolution in some way .",
    "also , the well - posedness of the linear equations are relevant by themselves for the following two reasons .",
    "first , the mass formula at the linear level can in principle be used to prove linear stability in axial symmetry of a background solution like a black hole .",
    "second , the well - posedness of the linear equations and the mass formula give insight on appropriate boundary conditions on a bounded domain .",
    "in particular , the mass formula allows us to calculate the gravitational waves that leave or enter a bounded domain .",
    "the plan of the article is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : main - results ] we summarize our mains results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : axisymm - vacu - einst ] we review the axially symmetric , vacuum , einstein equations .",
    "although this is well known , the way we process to obtain the final equations in the maximal - isothermal gauge is slightly different than the standard one used in the numerical works mentioned above . in sec .",
    "[ sec : linearized - equations ] we derive our main linear equations and in sec .",

    "[ sec : numerical - results ] we present the numerical results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : final - comments ] we conclude with a discussion of the relevant open problems .",
    "this article has two main results .",
    "the first one is to prove that the linearized einstein vacuum equations in the maximal - isothermal gauge reduce to a very simple set of equations together with a conserved quantity .",
    "this conserved quantity is the mass up to second - order corrections and it is written as a positive definite integral over a spacelike surface , which has a similar form as the energy of the wave equation .",
    "this property of the mass , which only holds in this gauge , is of course what distinguished this system of equations from any other linearization .",
    "the second result is the numerical study of these equations , together with the analysis of appropriate boundary conditions on a finite grid .",
    "let us describe the first result . in axial symmetry ,",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom of the vacuum gravitational field are prescribed by two functions , which can be chosen to be the norm and twist potential of the axial killing vector ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : axisymm - vacu - einst ] ) .",
    "we make , for simplicity , the extra assumption that the twist is zero ( although we discuss the full non - linear equations with twist in sec .",
    "[ sec : axisymm - vacu - einst ] ) .",
    "this assumption simplify the equations but it is by no means essential . in the maximal - isothermal gauge , the linearized einstein equations with respect to a minkowski background",
    "reduce to the following two equations for the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the reason for the notation for the last function is that it represents the @xmath2 component of the shift vector as we will see below ) @xmath3 these equations are deduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : linearized - equations ] .",
    "we have chosen cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 .",
    "the relevant domain for these equations is the half plane @xmath5 , @xmath6 denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "a dot denotes time derivative and @xmath8 is the flat laplacian in 2-dimensions @xmath9 the boundary condition for eqs . and arise from the regularity of the spacetime metric at the axis and the standard asymptotically flat fall - off behavior at infinity .",
    "we discuss this in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : bound - cond - axial ] and [ sec : prop - line - equat ] .",
    "let us present here a summary .",
    "is an elliptic equation for @xmath1 , we need to prescribe boundary conditions on @xmath7 . on the axis",
    "@xmath10 we require @xmath11 and at infinity we impose @xmath12 where @xmath13 . with these boundary conditions , eq .",
    "has a unique solution .",
    ". is a wave equation for @xmath0 , we need to prescribe initial conditions , which are functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that @xmath16 the axis represents a timelike boundary for the wave equation , and hence we need to prescribe also boundary conditions there .",
    "this is the delicate part , because the equations are singular at the axis and hence we are not free to chose arbitrary boundary conditions there . from the axial regularity of the spacetime metric",
    "we deduce that the initial data @xmath17 and @xmath18 should vanish at the axis , namely @xmath19 in sec .",
    "[ sec : prop - line - equat ] , using series expansions , we prove that conditions on the initial data imply that @xmath20 for all times .",
    "moreover , solutions @xmath0 and @xmath1 of equations and satisfy a parity conditions , namely @xmath0 is an even function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 is an odd function of @xmath2 .",
    "these parity conditions imply that the spacetime metric is smooth at the axis .",
    "it is important to emphasize that these conditions are consequences of equations and alone , without any extra requirement .    in the numerical implementation , eqs .",
    "are used as boundary conditions at the axis .",
    "there are various ways to re - express and in order write conditions as proper timelike boundary conditions ( e.g. dirichlet or neumann ) .",
    "for example , following @xcite , in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - techniques ] we write them in terms of the rescaled variable @xmath21 .",
    "we are interested in asymptotically flat solutions of and .",
    "we will argue in sec .",
    "[ sec : prop - line - equat ] , that the typical fall off behavior as @xmath22 for this kind of solutions is @xmath23 that is , if we chose initial data @xmath17 and @xmath18 which satisfy then @xmath0 will satisfy for all times .",
    "all the other components of the linear perturbation can be calculated in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as follows . in our gauge",
    "the four dimensional coordinates are given by @xmath24 .",
    "a general twist free linear perturbation is written as follows @xmath25 where the functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath1 and @xmath28 depends only on @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath1 is given by ( [ eq:120b ] ) , the other functions are calculated in terms of @xmath0 as follows .",
    "the functions @xmath27 is a time derivative of @xmath0 @xmath29 the function @xmath26 is determined by the following elliptic equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 this operator , which appears frequently in the rest of the article , is the flat laplace operator in 3-dimensions written in cylindrical coordinates and acting on axially symmetric functions .",
    "the boundary condition for equation ( [ eq:86 ] ) at the axis is given by @xmath33 and at infinity we impose @xmath34 eq .",
    "can be also viewed as an equation in @xmath35 . in this case",
    "we do not need to prescribe any boundary condition at the axis .",
    "condition will be automatically satisfied for any regular solution .    finally , the other component of the shift vector is determined by the following equation @xmath36 with boundary condition at the axis @xmath37 and decay condition at infinity @xmath38    the total mass of the system is given by the following integral @xmath39 note that in order to compute the mass we need the function @xmath26 , which satisfies eq . .",
    "this equation is uncoupled with equations and .",
    "the integral is conserved .",
    "that is , for every solution of and which satisfy the boundary conditions , , and decay at infinity like we have @xmath40 the conservation law is deduced from a local conservation formula which involves the integrand of the mass formula .",
    "this local conservation law can be also used to compute the gravitational waves entering or leaving a bounded domain .",
    "we discuss this in sec .",
    "[ sec : prop - line - equat ]",
    ".    the second main result of this article is the numerical study of the system and .",
    "we describe this in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - results ] .",
    "let us briefly summarize these results .",
    "the system and appears , from the numerical evidences , to be well posed and numerically stable .",
    "in particular , this imply that the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 remain bounded for all times by a constant that depends only on the initial data .",
    "this is consistent with the linear stability of minkowski spacetime .",
    "the numerical calculations are , of course , performed on a finite grid .",
    "hence , we need to prescribe boundary conditions on a bounded domain . these conditions should be compatible with asymptotically flatness in the following sense .",
    "assume we have a sequence of bounded domains such that in the limit they cover the half plane @xmath7 .",
    "if we solved the equations for this sequence of domains we should recover in the limit the asymptotically flat solution described above .",
    "there exists many different boundary conditions that have this property .",
    "in particular , homogeneous dirichlet conditions for @xmath1 and @xmath0 . for each bounded domain the mass is not conserved .",
    "however , as the size of the domain increase we expect that the mass approach a time independent constant .",
    "this is precisely what we observe in our numerical calculations .    for our present goal",
    ", this kind of asymptotically flat boundary conditions is all what we need",
    ". there is , however , an interesting extra point here . to model an isolated system on a finite grid it is important to prescribe boundary conditions such that the gravitational radiation leaves the domain . in general",
    ", this is a very difficult problem since it is not even clear what we mean by gravitational radiation at a finite distance .",
    "however , as we mention above , in our gauge the mass formula allow us to compute gravitational radiation on a bounded domain .",
    "although it appears not to be possible to prescribe boundary conditions such that the gravitational waves always leave the domain , the mass formula suggests a particular kind of boundary conditions that has this behavior in our numerical calculations .",
    "that is , under these boundary conditions , the mass on a bounded domain is monotonically decreasing with time for the particular kind of initial data used in the computations .",
    "we emphasize however that we have not been able to prove this analytically .",
    "we explore this in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : prop - line - equat ] and [ sec : numerical - results ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to write the vacuum einstein equations for axially symmetric spacetimes in the maximal - isothermal gauge .",
    "this involves three clearly distinguished steps . in the first one ,",
    "described in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmetry - reduction ] , we perform a symmetry reduction of einstein equations to obtain a set of geometrical equations in the 3-dimensional quotient manifold .",
    "these equations can be viewed as 3-dimensional einstein equations coupled with effective matter sources . in the second step ( sec .",
    "[ sec:2 + 1-decomposition ] ) we chose an arbitrary spacelike foliation in the quotient manifold and split the equations in time plus space . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gauge ] we fixes the foliation and the coordinate system .",
    "we also write the mass formula in this gauge . finally , in sec .",

    "that the definition of the metric involves a conformal rescaling with respect to the canonical metric @xmath63 defined by @xmath64 that is , we have @xmath65 this rescaling simplify considerably the field equations .",

    "there are no second derivatives of the fields @xmath66 and @xmath52 ( compare , for example , with equation ( 20 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that eq .",

    "if the killing field is timelike ( @xmath69 ) then the metric @xmath60 is riemannian and the equations  are the stationary einstein vacuum equations . on the other hand , when the killing vector is spacelike ( @xmath70 ) , the metric @xmath60 is a is a 3-dimensional lorenzian metric ( we chose the signature @xmath71 ) . in axially symmetry ,",
    "the killing vector @xmath45 is spacelike and its norm vanishes at the axis of symmetry .",
    "hence , the equations are formally singular at the axis .",

    "however , since the behavior of @xmath66 at the axis , as we will see in the next sections , is controlled a priori this singular scaling does not seems to introduce any extra difficulty in the equations .",

    "the third symmetry is scaling .",

    "for a given solution @xmath209 we define the rescaled function as @xmath210 where @xmath211 and the same for @xmath1 .",
    "then , @xmath212 define also a solution in terms of the rescaled coordinates .",
    "the mass rescales like @xmath213    in order to understand the equations in a simpler situation , let us first consider eqs . and on a bounded domain @xmath214 which does not contain the axis .",
    "on @xmath214 the coefficient of eqs . and",
    "are smooth .",
    "is an elliptic equation for @xmath1 if we consider @xmath0 as a given function .",
    "hence , in order to solve this equation we need to prescribe elliptic boundary conditions for @xmath1 on @xmath215 .",
    "for example , dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "eq . is a wave equation for @xmath0 if we consider @xmath1 as a given function . to solve this wave equation we need to prescribe initial data for @xmath0 and @xmath216 at @xmath217 together with compatible boundary conditions for @xmath0 at @xmath218 for example dirichlet , neumann or sommerfeld boundary conditions for @xmath0 at @xmath215 .",
    "the equations are of course coupled , so it is not obvious that the above procedure of fixing boundary conditions is correct since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not `` given functions '' .",
    "however , it is possible to prove that this is procedure is in fact correct . consider the following iteration scheme @xmath219 in this iteration , the equations are not coupled and hence the boundary conditions mentioned above ( which are kept fixed ) are correct .",
    "following similar arguments to the one presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) it is not difficult to see that this iteration converges for some small time interval .",
    "and hence we get well - posedness for the linear system and under these boundary conditions on the domain @xmath214 .",
    "the reason why the iteration and converges is the following . from eq . , using standard elliptic , estimates we obtain that @xmath1 is equivalent ( in number of derivatives ) to @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the term containing @xmath1 in eq . is equivalent to a first order derivative of @xmath0 and then it is not in the principal part of the wave equation .",
    "this rough argument suggests that the combination of elliptic estimates and energy estimates for the wave equations will close and hence the iteration will converge .",
    "this is basically the argument presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the domain @xmath214 is not bounded , this argument will still work if we add appropriate fall - off conditions at infinity .",
    "however , the situation change drastically when @xmath214 includes the axis .",
    "let us analyze that case .    since the axis is a singular boundary for the equations , we are not free to chose arbitrary boundary condition there .",
    "in fact @xmath1 and @xmath220 should vanishes at the axis , otherwise the equations become singular . if we use lhpital rule ,",
    "we conclude that the term with @xmath1 in contain in fact two derivatives with respect to @xmath2 at the axis .",
    "that is , due to the lhopital limit , to divide by @xmath2 is equivalent as to take a derivative with respect to @xmath2 at the axis .",
    "but then , using eq . , we conclude that this term is equivalent to second derivatives of @xmath0 and hence it is in the principal part of the wave equation .",
    "we can not conclude that the iteration scheme  converges if we include the axis in the domain .",
    "this is , roughly speaking , the main difficulty to prove the well - posedness of the linear system and .",
    "it appears to be difficult to identify the principal part of the system at the axis and to construct an appropriate iteration scheme .",
    "let us discuss in detail the boundary conditions at the axis .",
    "we are interested in solutions @xmath0 which vanish at the axis , this comes from the regularity condition .",
    "moreover , we have seen in section [ sec : bound - cond - axial ] , the smoothness of the spacetime metric at the axis implies that the functions @xmath1 and @xmath0 should satisfies the parity conditions and . let us see heuristically , how these conditions are automatically implied by the equations provided we impose the following standard boundary conditions . at the axis",
    "we impose @xmath221 for @xmath0 we prescribe initial data @xmath222 such that @xmath223 note that we are not imposing any condition on @xmath0 at the axis for @xmath224 .",
    "we make a formal series expansion , namely let as assume that our solution is smooth at the axis and has the form @xmath225 substituting these expansions in eqs .",

    "that is , the solutions @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfy the parity conditions and respectively . using that @xmath0 is an even function of @xmath2 and that @xmath240 it is straightforward to deduce that the regularity condition holds for all times .",
    "we analyze the fall off behavior of the solution @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is completely determined by the initial data @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "let us assume that the initial data has compact support . in the case of the wave equation , the signal will propagate with finite speed and hence the solution will always have compact support for any finite time . in our case , however , the coupling with the elliptic eq . produce a non - local behavior .",

    "if we take time derivatives of the equations and repeat this argument , we get that all time derivatives of @xmath0 are @xmath250 .",
