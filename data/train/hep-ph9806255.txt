    "the recent drell - yan experiment by the e866/nusea collaboration at fermilab @xcite provides the best information yet on the detailed structure of the light antiquark sea of the proton .",
    "although previous experiments by the new muon collaboration @xcite on the difference between the proton and neutron structure functions established that an asymmetry in the sea exists , they yielded direct information only on the first moment of the antiquark asymmetry .",
    "the earlier drell - yan experiment by the na51 collaboration at cern @xcite measured the up and down antiquark ratio , though at zero rapidity @xcite , but in order to improve the statistical accuracy the data were binned to a single value of bjorken-@xmath2 .",
    "the e866 experiment , on the other hand , has for the first time mapped out the shape of the @xmath7 ratio over a large range of @xmath2 , @xmath8 .",
    "the relatively large asymmetry found in these experiments implies the presence of non - trivial dynamics in the proton sea which does not have a perturbative qcd origin . from the symmetry properties of qcd , we know that one source of non - perturbative quark - antiquark pairs is the pion cloud associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the novel and unexpected feature of the e866 data is that the @xmath9 asymmetry peaks at rather small values of @xmath2 , and drops quite rapidly with increasing @xmath2 , approximately like @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "this behavior had not been anticipated in global parameterizations of data , and is softer than pion cloud models of the nucleon would generally predict .",
    "while the former is just an artifact of an extrapolation of a parametric function into an unmeasured region , with no physics implications , the reason for the latter is the rather hard valence antiquark distribution in the pion , @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "although this @xmath2 dependence is softened somewhat by the probability of finding the pion in the nucleon in the first place , the resulting convoluted distribution still does not die off as rapidly , at large @xmath2 , as the new e866 data would suggest .",
    "our analysis suggests that a quantitative description of the entire region of @xmath2 covered in the experiment requires a delicate balance between several competing mechanisms , which leads us to speculate about the possibility of a two - phase picture of the non - perturbative sea of the nucleon . at larger @xmath2 ,",
    "the dynamics of the pion cloud of the nucleon come to the fore , with deep - inelastic scattering from the @xmath5 component of the nucleon wave function providing the bulk of the @xmath14 asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the important role of the @xmath15 isobar in nuclear physics has been known for a long time , and it proves to be of some importance in this case too .",
    "if a part of the @xmath6 distribution happens to be harder than the @xmath5 , there would be cancellation of some of the @xmath4 excess at large @xmath2 .",
    "such a piece does indeed arise in the light - cone formulation of the meson - cloud model , provided the @xmath16 form factor , parameterized for example by a dipole form , is harder than the @xmath17 form factor @xcite  something which is consistent with the measured difference between the nucleon and @xmath18 transition axial form factors .    to be consistent with the measured sum , @xmath19",
    ", it is known that both the @xmath20 and @xmath16 form factors need to be relatively soft @xcite .",
    "the best fit , within the pion cloud framework , to the data on both the sum and difference of @xmath3 and @xmath4 at large @xmath2 accounts for around half of the integrated asymmetry , leaving room for possible other , non - pionic , mechanisms to provide the missing strength at smaller @xmath2 .",
    "( while the usual discussions of the pionic contribution focus on the valence quarks in the pion , there is also some theoretical argument for a @xmath21 asymmetry in the sea of the pion .",
    "we also estimate how this might affect the analysis . )",
    "it should be noted that , aside from the flavor - asymmetric @xmath5 and @xmath22 components of the nucleon , there is no _ a priori _ reason why the ` bare ' ( non  pion - dressed ) nucleon state itself can not have an intrinsic asymmetric sea associated with it .",
    "in fact , this is actually what is expected from the pauli exclusion principle , as anticipated long ago by field and feynman @xcite on the simple basis that the @xmath23 and @xmath24 valence quark sectors are unequally populated in the proton ground state . although more difficult to estimate model - independently , the contribution to the @xmath14 difference from antisymmetrization has been calculated within a non - perturbative model of the nucleon @xcite . along the lines of the model estimates ,",
    "we find that the effects of antisymmetrization are most relevant at small @xmath2 , with normalization such that they can account for most of the remaining half of the integrated asymmetry . indeed",
    ", our analysis suggests that the best fit to the e866 data is obtained when both mechanisms play a role , consistent with the conclusions of earlier analyses @xcite of the nmc data on the proton  neutron structure function difference .    in the following , we firstly outline in section ii the experimental status of the @xmath7 asymmetry , including a comparison of the drell - yan data with deep - inelastic scattering data . in section iii the question of the possible origin of the asymmetry",
    "is addressed , in the form of the chiral structure of the nucleon and the associated pion cloud , while section iv deals with the role of the pauli exclusion principle as a source of flavor asymmetry . in section",
    "v we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the e866/nusea collaboration measured @xmath25 drell - yan pairs produced in @xmath1 and @xmath0 collisions . in the parton model the drell - yan cross section is proportional to : @xmath26 where @xmath27 or @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the light - cone momentum fractions carried by partons in the projectile and target hadron , respectively .    assuming that the deuteron is composed of two bound nucleons , and utilizing isospin symmetry ( @xmath31 , etc . ) , in the limit @xmath32 ( in which @xmath33 ) the ratio of the deuteron to proton cross sections can be written : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the antiquark distribution in the bound proton .",
    "neglecting relativistic and nucleon off - shell effects , this can be approximated by a convolution of the antiquark distribution in the proton with the proton distribution function in the deuteron @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the distribution of nucleons in the deuteron with light - cone momentum fraction @xmath38 . in practice",
    "we use the function @xmath39 from ref.@xcite , where it is given in terms of a realistic deuteron wave function that has been constrained to reproduce the static deuteron properties and nucleon  nucleon phase shifts .    in the absence of nuclear effects ,",
    "@xmath40 , one would have : @xmath41 so that the ratio would be unity if @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "we know that nuclear shadowing exists in the deuteron at small @xmath2 ( see @xcite and references within ) , and at large @xmath2 nuclear binding and fermi motion effects come into prominence @xcite .",
    "since the bulk of the effect is observed outside the very small @xmath2 region , shadowing will not be important in these data .",
    "however , fermi smearing is potentially more relevant , as what enters in the parentheses in eq.([rful ] ) is the ratio of smeared to unsmeared _ sea _ quark distributions , for which smearing effects should come into play at much smaller @xmath2 than for the total structure function @xcite . in fig .  1 we show the ratio of the antiquark distributions in a proton bound in the deuteron to that in a free proton , @xmath43 .",
    "parameterizing the antiquarks for illustration purposes at large @xmath2 by a simple @xmath44 form , with @xmath45 and 10 , the ratio is seen to rise rapidly above @xmath46 , though in the measured region it only deviates from unity by a few percent . from this one can conclude that eq.([nonuc ] ) should be a reasonable approximation to eq.([rful ] ) .    in the extreme large-@xmath29 limit , where @xmath47",
    ", the cross section ratio would directly give @xmath9 : @xmath48 for the e866 data the criterion @xmath32 is not always satisfied , however , so that eq.([rapprox ] ) gives only an indication of the sensitivity of the drell - yan cross section to @xmath9 , and in practice the full parton model cross section is used together with an iterative procedure in which the valence and total sea distributions are assumed known and the extracted @xmath9 ratio adjusted to fit the data @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 ratio is shown in fig .  2 , where the asymmetry is found to peak at relatively small @xmath2 , @xmath49 , dropping rapidly to unity by @xmath50 .",
    "also shown for comparison is the na51 data point @xcite , extracted from the drell - yan @xmath1 and @xmath51 asymmetry at @xmath52 , which lies slightly above the e866 data .",
    "the two fits are from the cteq4 @xcite parameterization ( dashed line ) , which has the asymmetry extending out to larger @xmath2 , and the more recent mrs98 analysis @xcite ( dotted line ) , which included the e866 data .    from the @xmath9 ratio",
    "the e866/nusea collaboration further extract the difference , @xmath53 , assuming the sum @xmath54 from the cteq4 fit , @xmath55 the resulting points are shown in fig .  3 , again in comparison with the cteq4 and mrs98 parameterizations .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the sea quark distribution in these fits is not very well determined at large @xmath2 . in particular ,",
    "a larger total sea at @xmath56 0.20.3 would result in a larger asymmetry @xmath15 in the region just where the e866 data appear to drop rapidly to zero .",
    "further data from the e866 experiment on the total antiquark distribution at large @xmath2 should help to clarify the issue .",
    "the drell - yan data can also be compared with the proton  neutron . ]",
    "structure function difference measured previously by the new muon collaboration @xcite , if one assumes that the valence quark distributions in the proton are known . in this case the antiquark asymmetry can be written : @xmath57 the @xmath58 difference extracted from the nmc data is shown in fig .",
    "3 using both the cteq4 ( open circles ) and mrs98 ( diamonds ) fits to the valence quark distributions . the nmc values appear to lie consistently above the e866 data for @xmath2 above @xmath59 , although there is some sensitivity to the choice of valence quark parameterization .",
    "not surprisingly , the e866 integrated value ( after extrapolating down to @xmath60 and up to @xmath61 ) is found to be : @xmath62 @xcite , somewhat smaller than the nmc value , which is @xmath63 @xcite , although still consistent within errors .",
    "this difference will be further enhanced if one corrects the nmc data for shadowing in the deuteron , omission of which underestimates the violation of the gottfried sum rule @xcite .",
    "the observation of a large asymmetry between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , now both at cern and fermilab , provides theorists with a challenge to better understand the internal , non - perturbative structure of the nucleon , as the asymmetry due to perturbative effects is known to be very small @xcite . in the next section we consider the possible origin of this asymmetry , in the form of the non - perturbative chiral structure of the nucleon .",
    "the simplest and most obvious source of a non - perturbative asymmetry in the light quark sea is the chiral structure of qcd . from numerous studies in low energy physics , including chiral perturbation theory , pions are known to play a crucial role in the structure and dynamics of the nucleon .",
    "however , there is no reason why the long - range tail of the nucleon should not also play a role at higher energies .",
    "this was first alluded to by sullivan @xcite , who argued that deep - inelastic scattering from the pion cloud of the nucleon is a scaling contribution to the nucleon structure function .",
    "indeed , expectations for the ratio of nuclear to nucleon structure functions , based on arguments that nuclear scales are much smaller than typical deep - inelastic scales , and therefore irrelevant , were proved to be dramatically wrong by the observation of the nuclear emc effect @xcite .    as pointed out by thomas",
    "@xcite , if the proton s wave function contains an explicit @xmath64 fock state component , a deep - inelastic probe scattering from the virtual @xmath65 , which contains a valence @xmath4 quark , will automatically lead to a @xmath4 excess _ in the proton_. this is the essential physical idea behind these expectations , and has been used to address not only the @xmath7 asymmetry @xcite , but also su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking in the proton sea @xcite , as well as asymmetries in the strange @xcite and heavier flavor sectors @xcite . in recent years",
    "this picture has been refined and elaborated with inclusion of additional meson and baryon states @xcite , and constraints put on many of the model parameters by comparisons of the predictions of the model with other processes @xcite .",
    "the basic hypothesis of the meson cloud model is that the physical nucleon state can be expanded ( in an infinite momentum frame ( imf ) and in the one - meson approximation ) in a series involving bare nucleon and two - particle , meson  baryon states .",
    "the essential ingredients are the meson  baryon distribution functions , @xmath66 , which give the probability to find a meson , @xmath67 , in the nucleon carrying a fraction @xmath68 of the nucleon s light - cone momentum .",
    "as discussed at length in the literature , for these functions to have the correct probabilistic interpretation in the imf , they must be related to the distributions of baryons in the nucleon , @xmath69 , via : @xmath70 this constraint can be verified easily in the imf , but is not entirely clear in covariant formulations ( see refs.@xcite for further discussion on this point ) . the imf treatment has the additional advantage that the meson and baryon are on - mass - shell and so one has no ambiguities associated with the possible off - mass - shell behavior of their structure functions that are encountered in the covariant treatments .",
    "the contribution to the antiquark distribution in the proton , @xmath71 , can then be written in the imf as a convolution of the meson distribution function and the antiquark distribution in the ( on - mass - shell ) pion : @xmath72 note that this is the leading contribution to the antiquark distribution , and is independent of the model of the bare nucleon states .    in earlier studies it was found , not surprisingly , that pions are the most important mesons , and that the dominant contributions are those associated with the @xmath5 component of the proton s wave function .",
    "the distribution of pions with a recoiling nucleon is given by @xcite : @xmath73 so that @xmath74 for the respective charge states .",
    "the invariant mass squared of the @xmath5 system is given by @xmath75 , and for the functional form of the @xmath17 vertex form factor @xmath76 we take a simple dipole parameterization : @xmath77 normalized so that the coupling constant @xmath78 has its standard value (= 13.07 ) at the pole ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the symmetry relations ( [ fysym ] ) are automatically guaranteed with this type of form factor , whereas in the earlier covariant formulations @xcite , with @xmath80-dependent form factors , this could not be achieved .",
    "note that the e866 group also utilized the formulation in terms of @xmath80-dependent form factors in their recent theoretical analysis @xcite of the drell - yan data .",
    "the antiquark distribution in the pion has been measured in @xmath5 drell - yan experiments by the e615 collaboration at fermilab @xcite and by the na10 @xcite and na3 @xcite collaborations at cern .",
    "these have been parameterized in next - to - leading order analyses in refs.@xcite . unless stated otherwise , we use the valence part of the pion s antiquark distribution from ref.@xcite throughout this analysis .",
    "because the meson cloud model is a model of part of the ( non - perturbative ) sea , it can only be reliably applied to describing the non - singlet @xmath58 distribution . in fig .",
    "4 we show the calculated difference arising from the @xmath5 component of the proton s wave function for two different cut - off masses , @xmath81  gev ( dashed ) and 1.5  gev ( solid ) , giving average multiplicities @xmath82 and 26% , respectively . with the latter one",
    "has excellent agreement at intermediate @xmath2 , @xmath83 , while somewhat overestimating the data at the larger @xmath2 values .",
    "the excess at large @xmath2 is less severe for the smaller cut - off .",
    "however , the strength of the contribution in that case is too small at lower @xmath2 .    to reconstruct the ratio from the calculated difference ,",
    "we assume , following e866 , that the total @xmath54 is given by the cteq4 parameterization @xcite , and invert eq.([deltarsum ] ) .",
    "the resulting ratio is plotted in fig .",
    "5 . at small @xmath2 the agreement with the data for the larger",
    "cut - off is clearly excellent , but at larger @xmath2 the calculation does not follow the downward trend suggested by the data , similar to the cteq4 parameterization in fig .  2 .",
    "both figs .",
    "4 and 5 suggest that the excess of @xmath4 over @xmath3 is too strong for @xmath84 , and that a mechanism which suppresses or cancels this excess could be responsible for the behavior seen in the data .",
    "one way to obtain such a suppression would be if the pion structure function were softer .",
    "actually , perturbative qcd suggests that the leading twist part of @xmath85 should behave like @xmath86 @xcite at large @xmath2 ( see also ref.@xcite ) , although the drell - yan data @xcite show that it is closer to @xmath87 , even with the inclusion of higher twist contributions .    within the pion cloud model",
    "another way that some of the cancellation can be understood is through the @xmath15 isobar .",
    "although the @xmath22 component should be smaller in magnitude than the @xmath5 , if some part of the @xmath6 distribution were to be harder than the @xmath5 it would allow for some cancellation of the large-@xmath2 excess , while preserving more of the asymmetry at smaller @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , qualitatively such behavior is exactly what is seen in the model .    in the imf ,",
    "the pion distribution function with a recoil @xmath15 is given by @xcite : @xmath88    \\left [ k_t^2 + ( m_{\\delta } + ( 1-y ) m)^2 \\right]^2 \\over 6\\ m_{\\delta}^2\\ ( 1-y)^3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the @xmath22 invariant mass squared and we take the same functional form ( c.f .",
    "eq.([ff ] ) ) for the @xmath16 form factor as for @xmath20 .",
    "the different @xmath22 charge states are obtained from eq.([fypid ] ) via @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath16 coupling constant is defined by : @xmath91 with @xmath92 the rarita - schwinger spinor - vector .",
    "the value of @xmath93 can be related to the @xmath20 coupling constant via su(6 ) symmetry , @xmath94 gev@xmath95 ( with @xmath96 ) .",
    "note that in ref.@xcite ( see also @xcite ) the @xmath16 coupling was extracted from the width of the decay @xmath97 , giving a somewhat larger value @xmath98 gev@xmath95 compared with the su(6 ) value .",
    "however , from numerous studies @xcite of @xmath5 scattering in the @xmath15 resonance region , it is known that up to 50% of the @xmath15 width comes from @xmath5 rescattering ( for example , through diagrams of the chew - low type ) , so that it would be inappropriate to acribe the entire width to the tree level process in determining @xmath93 .",
    "we expect the su(6 ) value for the @xmath16 coupling to be accurate to within @xmath99 1020% .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the @xmath6 distribution function as a function of @xmath68 , compared with the @xmath5 distribution ( [ fypin ] ) .",
    "the latter is calculated with a form factor cut - off , @xmath100 , of 1  gev , while the former has @xmath101  gev , which gives @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution is somewhat broader than the @xmath5 , peaking at slightly larger @xmath68 ( 0.3 c.f .",
    "0.25 ) and having more strength at larger @xmath68 , so that relatively more of the @xmath5 contribution may be canceled at larger @xmath2 than at smaller @xmath2 .",
    "( note that in covariant approaches with a @xmath80-dependent dipole form factor the @xmath6 distribution is softer than the @xmath5 , so that there the @xmath15 plays a negligible role at large @xmath2 . )",
    "the cancellation of the @xmath4 excess with the inclusion of @xmath22 states can be seen explicitly in fig .  7 , where the ( positive ) @xmath5 and ( negative )",
    "@xmath6 contributions are shown ( dashed lines ) for @xmath103  gev and @xmath101  gev , together with the sum ( solid ) . in fig .",
    "7(a ) the @xmath6 brings the difference @xmath58 closer to the large-@xmath2 data points , while allowing for a reasonable fit at smaller @xmath2 .",
    "however , the cancellation is still not sufficient to produce a downturn in the ratio at large @xmath2 , as the e866 data appear to prefer , fig .",
    "7(b ) .    more cancellation can be achieved by either increasing the @xmath6 contribution , or decreasing the @xmath5 contribution .",
    "either is acceptable in the model , as long as the resulting distributions do not contradict other observables , such as the total @xmath54 distribution , which should serve as an absolute upper limit on the strength of the form factor @xcite . in fig .",
    "8(a ) we show the contributions to the sum @xmath104 from the @xmath5 and @xmath22 components with @xmath105  gev and @xmath106  gev , compared with the cteq4 @xcite and mrs98 @xcite parameterizations . while at small @xmath2 the calculated distributions lie safely below the parameterization ( the difference is made up by the perturbatively generated @xmath107 antiquark distributions ) , at large @xmath2 the pion cloud already saturates the total sea with these cut - offs",
    " although one should add a cautionary note that the antiquark distribution at large @xmath2 is not determined very precisely . for softer combinations of form factors , namely @xmath81  gev , @xmath106  gev and @xmath108  gev , the total non - perturbative antiquark sea in fig .",
    "8(b ) is below the empirical parameterizations in both cases .",
    "therefore the only way to obtain a smaller @xmath4 excess at large @xmath2 and still be consistent with the total antiquark distribution is to reduce the @xmath5 component , having a cut - off smaller than for the @xmath16 vertex .",
    "it was argued in ref.@xcite that the @xmath109 form factor should be softer than the @xmath20 , based on the observation that the @xmath110 transition form factor was softer for @xmath111 than for @xmath112 .",
    "however , there is no clear connection between these form factors , and hence no compelling reason why the @xmath16 form factor can not be harder than that for @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , a comparison of the axial form factors for the nucleon and for the @xmath113@xmath15 transition strongly favor an @xmath113@xmath15 axial form factor that is significantly harder than that of the nucleon .",
    "in fact , the former is best fit by a 1.3  gev dipole , while the latter by a 1.02  gev dipole parameterization @xcite . within the framework of pcac these form factors",
    "are directly related to the corresponding form factors for pion emission or absorption @xcite .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the difference and ratio of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 distributions calculated with the softer @xmath20 form factor , @xmath81  gev , and @xmath106  gev .",
    "the excess at large @xmath2 now is largely canceled by the @xmath6 .",
    "however , the smaller @xmath5 contribution means that the asymmetry is underestimated in the intermediate @xmath2 range , @xmath83 .    based on these results",
    "it would appear difficult to obtain a quantitative description , within the pion cloud model , of both the ratio _ and _ the difference of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 distributions , together with the total sea .",
    "one needs to consider , therefore , the possibility that other mechanisms may at least be partly responsible for the discrepancy .",
    "additional meson  baryon components , such as the @xmath114 , could be included in extended versions of the meson cloud model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath114 , however , has a harder @xmath68 distribution than the @xmath5 , which would lead to an enhancement of asymmetry at large @xmath2 , in contradiction with the data , even though the @xmath115 structure function may be softer than the @xmath116 . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath114 contribution is known from previous analyses @xcite to be significant only for very hard @xmath117 form factors . for a @xmath118 vertex of similar shape to that used for the @xmath17 vertex , @xmath119 , the contribution from",
    "the @xmath115 is unimportant .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath120 contribution is far too small to be featured in any subsequent cancellation @xcite , if the @xmath120 form factor is comparable to that for @xmath22 .",
    "another interesting possibility is that the pion sea itself could be asymmetric . in eq.([conv ] ) only the valence structure of the pion was included , though in principle there could even be asymmetric contributions to @xmath58 in the proton from asymmetric @xmath121 and @xmath122 distributions in a pion .",
    "one obvious source of a pion sea asymmetry involves the same physics that is responsible for the charge radius of the @xmath65 , namely the dissociation into virtual @xmath116 and @xmath115 mesons , @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "the effects of a meson cloud of a pion ( @xmath125 as well as @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) on deep - inelastic structure functions were previously investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "( of course the @xmath15-isobar again cancels some of this asymmetry through the @xmath128 , but as with the valence pion contributions , the sign of the effect remains . )",
    "unfortunately , nothing is known empirically about the pion sea , so that the shape and normalization of such an asymmetry can at present only be speculative . rather than construct a detailed model of the pion sea involving additional free parameters ( meson  meson vertex functions ) , at this stage it is more practical to ask how sensitive could the overall @xmath9 asymmetry be to a possible asymmetric sea , one that is consistent with all the known phenomenological constraints . to address this question we parameterize the non - singlet part of the sea distribution in the pion by a simple form , @xmath129 from low - energy quark models and regge",
    "theory the exponent @xmath130 is expected to be around 0 and 1/2 , respectively , while @xmath131 should be between 57 from perturbative qcd arguments and from our knowledge of the nucleon sea quark distribution .",
    "the normalization of this component is unknown and given by the parameter @xmath132 . allowing for up to a factor 2 uncertainty in the pion sea ( which is related to the uncertainty in the knowledge of the gluon distribution in the pion )",
    ", we set @xmath133 , and to be definite take @xmath134 and @xmath135 .    the resulting @xmath9 ratio is shown in fig .  10 for a ratio of pion sea distributions @xmath136 = 2:1 ( lower solid ) and 4:1 ( upper solid ) , respectively , as well as for a symmetric sea ( dashed ) for @xmath137 gev .",
    "clearly one gets appreciable enhancement in the low- and intermediate-@xmath2 range , bringing the curves to better agreement with the data , even though the ratio is somewhat overestimated at low @xmath2 for the more asymmetric sea scenario .",
    "how reasonable this choice of parameters is can only be ascertained by acquiring data on the pion structure function at values of @xmath2 smaller than currently available .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of an asymmetric pion sea for drell - yan @xmath5 and other processes will be discussed in more detail elsewhere @xcite  see also ref.@xcite for a discussion of measurements which would be sensitive to such an asymmetry",
    ".    going beyond explanations involving meson clouds , one can also investigate the possibility that the bare nucleon itself could be asymmetric with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as suggested long ago by field and feynman @xcite",
    ", the pauli exclusion principle can contribute to the asymmetry on the basis of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 valence quarks being unequally represented in the proton , thereby affecting the likelihood with which @xmath138 pairs can be created in different flavor channels .",
    "in fact , earlier analyses of the nmc data @xcite suggested that the best agreement between theory and experiment could be obtained with the combined effects of pions and antisymmetrization , and in the next section we explore this possibility further .",
    "although not directly attributable to the exclusion principle , the perturbative effects of higher - order quark exchange diagrams on the @xmath58 difference were calculated long ago by ross and sachrajda @xcite .",
    "they found that while they had the correct ( positive ) sign , their magnitude was insignificantly small , since they only arose at order @xmath139 .",
    "the flavor asymmetry of the sea associated with the pauli principle can therefore only be addressed within non - perturbative approaches to parton distributions , as concluded in @xcite .",
    "attempts to calculate the valence distribution of the proton in various quark models began in the mid-70s @xcite , when it was realized that the relationship to the qcd improved parton model is quite natural at a low scale ( below 1  gev@xmath140 ) , where most of the momentum of the nucleon resides on its valence quarks @xcite .",
    "this observation has been successfully exploited by the dortmund group @xcite , for example , in constructing phenomenological , valence dominated , parameterizations in just this region .",
    "bag model calculations of nucleon structure functions have provided some interesting insights into the non - perturbative parton distributions @xcite . for any model in which valence quarks are confined by a strong scalar field ,",
    "the vacuum inside and outside the hadron will be different . from the point of view of an external probe , such as the virtual photon in deep inelastic scattering ,",
    "the change in the vacuum structure inside the hadron will appear as an intrinsic , non - perturbative sea of @xmath141 pairs  @xcite .",
    "because of the pauli exclusion principle , the presence of two valence @xmath23 quarks , as opposed to a single valence @xmath24 quark , in the proton implies an asymmetry in this non - perturbative sea , so that there is a small excess of @xmath142 pairs over @xmath143 pairs .    for details of the quantitative calculation of this effect , which is model dependent , we refer to the original papers @xcite .",
    "it is enough for us that the shape of @xmath21 was found to be similar to that of the usual sea quark distributions and the normalization , @xmath144 , less than 0.25 . with this in mind , we parameterize the pauli contribution by : @xmath145 because the e866 data implies a softer asymmetry than typical global fits of total sea quark distributions would give , as figs .",
    "2 and 3 illustrate , phenomenologically the power @xmath146 should be @xmath147 rather than the 57 that has been common for the total @xmath148 fits @xcite .",
    "( compare also with the original feynman - field parameterization @xcite which had @xmath149 and 7 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . )",
    "the pauli effect will produce an excess of @xmath4 over @xmath3 over the whole range of @xmath2 , so that it can not lead to any cancellation of the large-@xmath2 asymmetry . to be consistent with the trend of the large-@xmath2 data , especially for the @xmath9 ratio",
    ", one needs therefore to keep the @xmath20 contribution softer than that from @xmath16 . taking the @xmath5 and @xmath6 contributions calculated with @xmath81  gev and @xmath106  gev as in fig .  9 above",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "11 the combined effects of pions and the pauli effect . for the latter the exponent @xmath150 , and the normalization is @xmath151 , which is at the lower end of the expected scale but consistent with the bag model calculations @xcite . together with the integrated asymmetry from pions , @xmath152 , the combined value @xmath153 is in quite reasonable agreement with the experimental result , 0.100 from e866 and 0.148 from nmc . while the quality of the fit in fig .",
    "11 is quite good , it would be further improved ( see fig .",
    "12 ) if one were to use the softer pion structure function , @xmath154 , as suggested by perturbative qcd @xcite .    before leaving this discussion of antisymmetrization we should also mention the calculations of donoghue and golowich @xcite , and more recently steffens and thomas @xcite , of the one - gluon - exchange corrections to the 3-quark proton wave function . considering all possible permutations of the 5-quark wave function allowed by fermi statistics ,",
    "the antisymmetrization of the @xmath138 pair split off from the emitted gluon with the quarks in the nucleon ground state , it turns out that there are in fact more diagrams for @xmath23 quarks than @xmath24 quarks .",
    "this peculiarity results in there actually being an excess of @xmath3 quarks over @xmath4 , albeit a very small one . on the other hand",
    ", one should note that this calculation considered just the perturbative contribution , while the signal - thomas effect @xcite is a totally non - perturbative phenomenon , including all possible non - perturbative interactions between the produced quark ( or antiquark ) and the confining mean field of the proton .",
    "steffens and thomas also investigated the effects of antisymmetrization between @xmath138 pairs arising from one - pion loops with the three quarks in the nucleon ground state @xcite , although here again the effects were found to be quite small compared with the antisymmetrization for the bare nucleon state , and from the pion cloud contribution discussed in section iii .",
    "we have , for the first time , at our disposal important new data which map out the @xmath2-dependence of the asymmetry of the light antiquark sea .",
    "most importantly , the e866 drell - yan results confirm the earlier observations that the @xmath4 and @xmath3 content of the proton is not symmetric .",
    "one of the more interesting new features of the data is the relatively fast downturn in the @xmath9 ratio beyond @xmath49 , which drops rapidly back to unity by @xmath50 .",
    "taken at face value , this would appear to provide a challenge to models in which the asymmetry is assumed to arise solely from the pion cloud of the nucleon , and in turn leads us to consider a richer and more complex structure of the non - perturbative sea in which several mechanisms may give competing contributions .",
    "the evidence from the large-@xmath2 data indicates that a @xmath6 component in the nucleon wave function may be necessary , one which is harder in momentum space than the @xmath5 component .",
    "such a distribution arises naturally in the infinite momentum frame formulation of the pion cloud , unlike in earlier covariant approaches using @xmath80-dependent form factors where it was softer than the @xmath5 component and hence played no role at large @xmath2 .",
    "consistency with data for the sum of @xmath4 and @xmath3 at @xmath84 requires that both the @xmath20 and @xmath16 form factors be relatively soft , making it difficult to avoid underestimating the e866 asymmetry at intermediate @xmath2 , and leaving room for other effects , such as the pauli exclusion principle , to make up the difference . along the lines of previous estimates of the pauli effect",
    ", we find the contribution to the @xmath14 difference from antisymmetrization to be significant in magnitude , and particularly important at small @xmath2 .",
    "our final results suggest that the best description of the e866 data is indeed that in which pions and antisymmetrization play roughly equal roles  consistent with the findings of the earlier analysis @xcite of the nmc data for @xmath155 .    in conclusion , we note that it would be helpful to have more data at large @xmath2 , where the error bars are largest , to verify the downward trend of @xmath58 , and to further explore the possible discrepancy between the fermilab and cern data .",
