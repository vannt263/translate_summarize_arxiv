    "one widely used solution in the combustion community is to use surrogate fuels that consist of a small number of hydrocarbons representing the major hydrocarbon classes present in real gasoline .",

    "in addition , prfs can not capture the so - called gasoline sensitivity , the difference between motor octane number ( mon ) and research octane number ( ron ) ; ron and mon are equal for any prf mixture .    in order to better match the physical and chemical properties of gasoline , a number of research groups developed surrogate formulations containing additional components used to represent other major hydrocarbon classes ( e.g. , olefins , aromatics ) .",

    "the computational cost of chemistry scales by the third power of the number of species in the worst case  @xcite . in three - dimensional , high - fidelity simulations of engines or combustion chambers where mesh sizes could range cells ,",
    "chemistry calculations must be performed at least once for each grid point or cell .",

    "produce compact skeletal and reduced mechanisms for the aforementioned rd387 gasoline surrogate capable of predicting key combustion phenomena .    while the reduced chemical models demonstrated here are specifically applicable only to the rd387 gasoline surrogate , the mechanism reduction approach will be useful in general for reduction of large detailed mechanisms for multicomponent surrogate fuels .",
    "a number of mechanism reduction methods have been developed in recent years to counter the trend of increasing mechanism sizes , as reviewed by lu and law  @xcite .",
    "most approaches focus on identifying and removing unimportant species , or performing `` skeletal '' reduction .",
    "many methods have been developed , but one class that received significant development is based on the directed relation graph ( drg )  @xcite .",
    "similar to the earlier graphical representation of reaction pathways of bendtsen et al .",
    "@xcite , drg quantifies the importance of species using normalized contributions to the overall production rates of certain ( preselected ) important target species . since the introduction of drg ,",
    "a number of variants have been developed , including drg - aided sensitivity analysis ( drgasa )  @xcite , drg with error propagation ( drgep )  @xcite , drgep with sensitivity analysis ( drgepsa )  @xcite , and path - flux analysis  @xcite .",
    "another reduction paradigm focuses on time - scale analysis , identifying and removing short times scales  induced by rapidly depleting species and/or fast reversible reactions  that cause chemical stiffness .",
    "many methods rely on the classical quasi - steady state ( qss )  @xcite and partial equilibrium approximations  @xcite , which replace differential equations with algebraic relations for some species .",
    "originally , such species and reactions were identified on the basis of experience and intuition , but systematic methods that use analysis of the jacobian matrix to identify qss species and partial equilibrium reactions , namely the computational singular perturbation ( csp )  @xcite and intrinsic low - dimensional manifold  @xcite methods , have since been developed .    finding a single skeletal reduction stage not sufficient to reduce the size of large detailed mechanisms , lu and law  @xcite presented a multi - stage reduction strategy and applied it to to a detailed mechanism for _ n_-heptane .",
    "their approach consisted of drgasa , unimportant reaction elimination , isomer lumping , and time scale reduction through the qss approximation .",
    "in addition , they grouped species with similar transport properties in the final reduced mechanism to reduce the cost of the mixture - averaged transport formulation .    in this work , we apply a multi - stage reduction strategy similar to that developed by lu and law  @xcite based on drgepsa to the large detailed mechanism for the rd387 gasoline surrogate of mehl et al .",
    "we selected drgepsa for the base skeletal reduction method following the demonstration of niemeyer et al .",
    "@xcite that drgepsa can produce more compact skeletal mechanisms for the same level of accuracy than drg , drgep , and drgasa .",
    "in the first stage , the drgepsa method is applied to remove a large number of unimportant species ( and corresponding reactions ) .",
    "second , a stage of further unimportant reaction elimination is performed to remove additional reactions ; this step does not affect the number of species , but the complexity of the mechanism is reduced .",
    "third , a final skeletal mechanism is produced after identifying and lumping isomers .",
    "finally , qss species are identified using csp analysis and an analytic solution for the qss species concentrations is generated .",
    "we then validate the resulting skeletal and reduced mechanisms over engine - relevant conditions , comparing the performance against that of the detailed mechanism in predicting global phenomena such as homogeneous , adiabatic ignition delays , perfectly stirred reactor extinction turning points , and laminar flame speeds ; in addition , comparisons between local temperature evolution profiles in autoignition provide more rigorous validation .    in the following sections",
    ", we will first describe the above multi - stage reduction methodology .",
    "a new greedy sensitivity analysis algorithm will be introduced and developed that can achieve greater reduction than the conventional algorithm for the same error limit . then",
    ", skeletal and reduced mechanisms at varying levels of complexity will be generated using our reduction approach .",
    "finally , validation of the skeletal and reduced mechanisms will be performed , followed by a discussion of these results .",
    "in the current work , we applied a multi - stage reduction procedure that consisted of a number of previously developed techniques  with a number of updates and improvements  to the detailed mechanism for the gasoline surrogate of mehl et al .",
    "the mechanism , developed to represent a four - component surrogate ( isooctane , _",
    "n_-heptane , toluene , and 2-pentene ) of rd387 gasoline , consists of 1388 species and 5933 reversible reactions . as discussed by niemeyer and",
    "sung previously  @xcite , the current version of this mechanism contains a dead - end pathway terminating with the radical ; as such , this species and the two reactions in which it participates were removed prior to mechanism reduction and later validation .",
    "the rd387 gasoline surrogate formulation consists of isooctane , _",
    "n_-heptane , toluene , and 2-pentene ( by molar percentage )  @xcite , denoted as the llnl surrogate hereafter .",
    "note that because the particular llnl surrogate formulation was chosen for the mechanism reduction , the resulting skeletal and reduced mechanisms are only guaranteed to perform well for this mixture composition . as recently discussed by niemeyer and",
    "sung  @xcite , using skeletal mechanisms outside the target mixture composition range can result in large errors . recognizing this , in the current study we checked the performance of the resulting skeletal mechanisms with varying mixture composition . while better performance can be obtained outside the target range by adding additional mixtures or the neat fuels to the set of input conditions , this comes at the cost of a ( potentially significantly ) larger skeletal mechanism .",
    "niemeyer and sung  @xcite also demonstrated that when performing mechanism reduction for multicomponent fuels , a greater extent of reduction can be achieved by using the mixture as input for a surrogate reduction rather than combining independent skeletal mechanisms produced for each neat component .",
    "another important finding of this study was that such a combination may overlook important interactions between the components  @xcite .",
    "the surrogate reduction strategy therefore forms the basis of the current work .",
    "two different ranges of conditions were used : one targeted at low - temperature homogenous charge compression ignition ( hcci ) engine conditions , and the second targeted at more traditional spark- or compression - ignition ( si or ci ) engine conditions at higher temperatures .",
    "thermochemical data for the hcci - like conditions were generated using constant - volume autoignition simulations performed using the initial conditions listed in [ t : conditions ] , based on a similar set used by mehl et al .",
    "these include a range of conditions covering initial pressures of , initial temperatures of , and equivalence ratios of .    for the si / ci engine conditions , we used autoignition initial conditions covering , , and equivalence ratios of .",
    "in addition , since the target phenomena include high - temperature flame propagation , for this range of conditions we performed the reduction including perfectly stirred reactor ( psr ) data  in addition to that from autoignition  covering the same range of pressures and equivalence ratios with an inlet temperature of .",
    "autoignition data were sampled densely during the ignition evolution , as described previously  @xcite .",
    "psr data were sampled at three points along the upper stable branch of the temperature response curve : ( 1 ) at the extinction turning point , ( 2 ) the point closest to , and ( 3 ) the logarithmic midpoint between points one and two .. ] for both the hcci and si / ci reductions , we applied an error limit of , corresponding to error in ignition delay for the autoignition simulations .",
    "we note that the original detailed mechanism for the llnl rd387 gasoline surrogate has been validated against a wide range of experimental data  @xcite , and therefore ensuring close agreement between the skeletal and reduced mechanisms and the detailed mechanism also ensures agreement with experimental data used for mechanism validation . for the psr simulations , the error corresponded to the maximum error in predictions of residence time at the extinction turning point ( point one ) and the response temperature at points two and three .",
    "for both sets of conditions , we selected isooctane , _",
    "n_-heptane , toluene , 2-pentene , oxygen , and nitrogen ( to prevent removal ) as the drgep target species .",
    "both the autoignition and psr simulations were parallelized using openmp  @xcite , such that multiple simulations may be performed simultaneously .",
    "this greatly reduced the runtime of the original sampling of the detailed mechanism in addition to that of the overall reduction process .",
    "the overall reduction procedure consists of stages in two categories : the skeletal reduction stages , including the drgepsa method , unimportant reaction elimination , and isomer lumping ; and the time - scale reduction stage , which includes csp analysis , applying the qss approximation , and generating the analytic qss solution .",
    "the details of these reduction stages are described in the following sections .",
    "first , we applied the drgepsa method , as described by niemeyer et al .",
    "@xcite , to remove a large number of species and reactions from the detailed mechanism .",
    "we describe this method briefly here ; further detail can be found in our prior work  @xcite .",
    "the drgepsa method consists of using drgep  @xcite first to quantify the importance of species to predetermined target species through a graph - based representation of species interdependence in the reaction system . after forming the graph by quantifying the interdependence of all species pairs",
    ", a graph search is performed using dijkstra s algorithm  @xcite initiating at the user - determined target species .",
    "species are then declared unimportant and removed when their importance value ( overall importance coefficient , @xmath0 ) falls below a cutoff threshold @xmath1 , which is determined iteratively based on the user - specified error limit . following the application of drgep , sensitivity analysis ( sa )",
    "is performed on certain remaining `` limbo '' species based on their @xmath0 values .",
    "species with overall importance coefficients above an upper threshold value ( @xmath2 ) are automatically retained , while the limbo species , for which @xmath3 , are considered individually for removal during the sa stage .",
    "previously used sensitivity analysis approaches removed limbo species one - by - one , arranged them in ascending order based on the error induced to the mechanism by their removal , and then removed the limbo species in this order until the global error reached a limit  @xcite .",
    "we refer to this approach in the following as the `` initially informed '' sensitivity analysis algorithm . in this work , we introduce an improved sensitivity analysis algorithm based on a novel `` greedy '' approach .",
    "greedy algorithms make locally optimal decisions with the goal of reaching global optima , using current information to make the choice that appears best  @xcite .",
    "the new greedy sensitivity analysis algorithm first evaluates the error induced by the removal of each species , given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the error of the current skeletal mechanism ( prior to temporary removal of limbo species _ s _ ) and @xmath6 the error induced by the removal of limbo species @xmath7 , by removing each one - by - one .",
    "then , using the criterion given by eq .  , the algorithm identifies the limbo species with the smallest induced error and removes it ; this procedure is repeated until the maximum error reaches the user - specified limit . by using @xmath8 rather than @xmath6 , the species whose removal affects the mechanism the least",
    "is selected for removal .",
    "admittedly , this sensitivity analysis algorithm is more computationally expensive due to the large number of error evaluations ( and associated autoignition / psr simulations ) and would likely be prohibitive for direct application to a detailed mechanism .",
    "however , the drgepsa approach makes this expense more tractable by using the drgep stage to initially eliminate a large number of species from the starting detailed mechanism .",
    "in contrast , the previous initially informed sensitivity analysis algorithm  @xcite used only the species original induced error information . in that case , following the initial species removal the ordering of species is based on outdated information , leading to potentially suboptimal decisions for removal . therefore , the algorithm could exit early , resulting in a larger - than - necessary skeletal mechanism .",
    "we will compare the results of the original initially informed and new greedy sensitivity analysis algorithms in due course .",
    "following the application of drgepsa , an additional step of further unimportant reaction elimination was performed based on the methodology of lu and law  @xcite .",
    "again , additional details on the method can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "this method uses the csp importance index to quantify the importance of reactions to all species in the drgepsa - generated mechanism . as with the drgep method , the cutoff threshold for reaction importance @xmath9 was determined iteratively based on error limit .",
    "next , we applied an isomer lumping stage to further reduce the number of species  @xcite . due to the similarity of many isomers thermodynamic and transport properties",
    ", such species can be lumped together in the chemical kinetics and transport equations . while more complex lumping strategies exist  @xcite , our procedure  following that of lu and law  @xcite  is based on the observation that many isomers mass fractions are correlated to the mass fraction of their group ( the sum of the isomers that comprise the group ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the mass fraction of isomer @xmath12 in group @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 is the total mass fraction of isomer group @xmath13 , and @xmath15 is a constant coefficient . for each group of isomers",
    "we determined the constant @xmath15 by sampling the isomer mass fractions using autoignition / psr simulations and performing a linear regression . to ensure the validity of data points , we only used reaction states where the isomer group mass fraction was non - negligible ( i.e. , where @xmath16 )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , unlike previous efforts  @xcite we automated the isomer selection by only choosing isomers for lumping when the coefficient of determination ( i.e. , @xmath17 value ) was above a certain threshold @xmath18 , determined iteratively based on error . once the isomer coefficients were determined , the skeletal mechanism was lumped by modifying the rate coefficients of reactions where each isomer is a reactant with the coefficient @xmath15 , and replacing the isomer with a notional species for the group to which it belongs .",
    "the final reduction stage involved applying the qss approximation to species identified using the csp analysis of lam and coworker  @xcite , and follows a similar approach to that of lu and law  @xcite .",
    "the reaction system can be represented with the odes @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the species concentration vector , @xmath21 is the species production rate vector , and @xmath22 is the jacobian matrix .",
    "csp analysis decomposes the source terms @xmath21 into `` modes '' using basis vectors : @xmath23 where the matrices @xmath24 and @xmath25 hold the column and row basis vectors , respectively , and @xmath26 is the vector of modes .",
    "practically , this procedure is implemented by calculating the jacobian @xmath22 using a sixth - order central finite difference , then using the lapack subroutine dgeev  @xcite to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "the jacobian is assumed to be time independent such that the basis rotation term @xmath27 , and as a result eq .",
    "becomes @xmath28 or @xmath29 where the diagonal elements of @xmath30 are the eigenvalues of @xmath22 , the columns of @xmath24 contain the right eigenvectors , and the rows of @xmath25 contain the left eigenvectors .",
    "next , the fast and slow subspaces are separated , such that @xmath31 the fast modes are those that rapidly exhaust and decay , while the slow modes remain important and control the overall behavior of the system .",
    "the eigenvalues associated with fast modes  the diagonal elements of @xmath32are negative with a much larger magnitude than the eigenvalues associated with the slow modes , contained in @xmath33 .",
    "the separation of the fast and slow subspaces is identified by a timescale analysis : @xmath34 where the time scale of the fast subspace ( @xmath35 ) is the negative inverse of the smallest magnitude eigenvalue ( @xmath36 ) in @xmath32 , @xmath37 is a characteristic time scale of the reacting system ( e.g. , autoignition delay , extinction turning point residence time ) , and @xmath38 is a safety factor ( e.g. , 100 ) .    once the fast and slow subspaces are separated , the species rates of production can be projected onto the two subspaces : @xmath39 where the fast and slow projection matrices are @xmath40 respectively .",
    "the @xmath41th species is considered qss if it satisfies the following condition over the entire parameter range of interest : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath41th diagonal element of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a small threshold value .",
    "once the set of qss species are selected , applying the qss approximation results in a set of nonlinear algebraic equations for the concentrations of each qss species , coupled with the remaining differential equations governing the non - qss species .",
    "past efforts focused on solving this system of equations through iterative schemes , but convergence difficulties can arise due to deterioration of the qss assumption when near and outside the validity range , leading to excessive computational cost  @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to linearize the relations  assuming the coupling between qss species is sparse in general  and generate an analytical solution for the concentrations of the qss species . here , we present such a methodology , adopted from the approach established by lu and law  @xcite , who also presented greater detail and explanation of this method .",
    "we summarize the necessary steps here .",
    "first , we must ensure the contribution of the nonlinear terms in the qss equations is negligible such that these terms can be eliminated from the relations . according to the qss approximation ,",
    "the net production rate of a qss species is small compared to both the production and consumption rates .",
    "this approximation results in a system of algebraic equations for the qss species : @xmath46 with the species production and consumption rates expressed as @xmath47 respectively , where @xmath48 is the number of qss species and @xmath49 the number of irreversible reactions .",
    "note that unlike the previous reduction stages , this step requires all reactions to be irreversible .",
    "the reaction rate is calculated using @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the rate coefficient , @xmath52 the total number of species ( both qss and non - qss ) , and @xmath53 the molar concentration of the @xmath12th species .",
    "equation   may be nonlinear due to the participation of multiple qss species or a stoichiometric coefficient greater than one for a particular qss species in a reaction .",
    "however , due to the typically low concentration of qss species ( after an initial transient period ) , these nonlinear terms may not be important .",
    "this importance can be quantified by calculating the normalized contribution of the nonlinear terms to the production and consumption rates of the @xmath41th qss species , expressed as @xmath54 respectively , where @xmath55    these measures of importance are similar to those used in drg / drgep as well as unimportant reaction elimination , and here  as in those methods ",
    "the terms are considered unimportant if the values fall below a cutoff threshold .",
    "the nonlinear terms may be neglected if @xmath56 where @xmath12 is a reaction state , @xmath57 the set of all reaction states of interest , and @xmath58 a small user - defined threshold ( e.g. , ) . if eqs .   and are satisfied using the criteria set by @xmath58 , all of the nonlinear contributions to qss equations are deemed negligible and removed . note that @xmath58 is used to evaluate the total contribution of all nonlinear terms rather than remove specific terms .    once the nonlinear terms are eliminated , the qss relations in eq .   can be expressed using a system of linear equations , which lu and law  @xcite termed the linearized qss approximation ( lqssa ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 note that the consumption and production coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are independent of qss species concentrations , and are either positive or zero . and @xmath53 appear in the denominators of eqs .   and , respectively , they are already present in the numerators through @xmath64 and @xmath65 and therefore cancelled out . ] as with the initial nonlinear qss relations , the system of equations given by eq",
    ".   may be solved by iterative schemes , but could suffer the same computational difficulties .",
    "in addition , the system could be solved through the typical gaussian elimination , but its algorithmic complexity is a cubic function of @xmath48 . instead , an analytic solution based on variable substitution and elimination offers an efficient approach for calculating the qss species concentrations .",
    "now , the challenge becomes finding the best order for elimination by substitution that minimizes the number of operations required .",
    "lu and law  @xcite proposed using graph theory to identify the interdependence of qss species .",
    "we detail the construction of such a qss graph ( qssg ) in the following .    the system of lqssa equations , as given by eq .",
    ", can be transformed to a form that offers a direct solution for each variable : @xmath66 where @xmath67 in this formulation , the solution for the concentration @xmath68 directly requires @xmath53 if @xmath69 .",
    "similar to the concept used in drg / drgep , the dependence of qss species concentrations on one another can be mapped to a directed graph , where each qss species is a graph node .",
    "edges between nodes exist when there is a direct dependence between species : the edge @xmath70 exists if and only if @xmath69 . in some cases , eq",
    ".   may be explicit for all qss species  meaning there is no interdependence  and the equations can be solved in the appropriate order without the need to substitute expressions and eliminate variables . in general , though , the qssg will consist of strongly coupled groups of qss species that form cycles of dependence ",
    "these are known as the strongly connected components ( sccs ) of the graph .",
    "intergroup coupling , on the other hand , is acyclic , such that an explicit elimination order of groups may be determined .    one important step is to prune the qssg of unimportant edges , again in a similar manner to the elimination of unimportant species in the drg and drgep methods . while less important when a small number of qss species exist , trimming the edges in a large graph ensures that the matrix * a * formed by the coefficients @xmath71 is sparse , resulting in multiple groups rather than one large cyclic group made up of all the qss species .",
    "the importance of qssg edges can be determined by calculating the normalized contribution of the @xmath12th qss species to the production rate of the @xmath41th qss species : @xmath72 where @xmath73 indicates taking the maximum value over the set of all reaction states of interest @xmath57 .",
    "unimportant qssg edges are then identified and removed through comparison with a small cutoff threshold @xmath74 , such that the remaining edges satisfy @xmath75    after pruning the graph edges , the next step is to identify the sccs and perform a topological sort  @xcite , which provides the order in which the sccs are to be solved .",
    "this is performed using the digraph_adj_components subroutine of burkardt s grafpack  @xcite , with the algorithm originally taken from thulasiraman and swamy  @xcite .",
    "the adjacency matrix * e * of the qssg , a necessary input , is formed by @xmath76 with the sccs identified and sorted , the only remaining task is to solve for the intra - scc species concentrations through variable elimination by substitution .",
    "lu and law  @xcite proposed a method to identify a near - optimal sequence for variable elimination , by calculating the normalized expansion cost @xmath77 of each variable @xmath68 , defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the number of qss species in the current scc .",
    "equation   is an eigenvalue problem , where the column vector * c * is the eigenvector of * l * associated with the principal eigenvalue .",
    "we solved this equation using the lapack subroutine dgeev  @xcite , and selected the resulting eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue .",
    "the values of * c * represent the relative expansion cost of each qss species in the scc , such that species with lower @xmath77 values should be eliminated from subsequent expressions first .",
    "therefore , species within the scc are sorted in ascending order of @xmath77 for elimination by substitution .",
    "finally , we note that in some cases , the lqssa  and therefore the analytic qss solution  may not be valid when the contributions from the nonlinear terms ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) are not negligible .",
    "for example , lu and law  @xcite compared the terms importance to detailed and skeletal mechanisms for ethylene , consisting of 70 and 33 species , respectively .",
    "they found that while the terms were in fact small ( between ) for the skeletal mechanism , the same was not true for the detailed mechanism , where the nonlinear contributions to the production rates ( @xmath81 ) were nearly unity in some cases .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the lqssa approximation is valid in the case of more complex skeletal mechanisms resulting from larger initial detailed mechanisms than ethylene .",
    "when non - negligible nonlinear terms exist in the skeletal mechanism , two main options exist : ( 1 ) remove offending species from the qss list , such that the nonlinear terms become negligible ; and ( 2 ) develop a hybrid analytic - iterative solution scheme , where most of variables are calculated analytically and a small number of nonlinear terms are solved iteratively . in the current study ,",
    "no selected parameter values during the time - scale reduction stage resulted in such a situation , so we did not need to pursue either option .",
    "the updated drgepsa method , the unimportant reaction elimination stage , the new isomer lumping stage , and the analytic qss reduction stage were incorporated into the latest version of the mechanism automatic reduction software ( mars ) package@xcite , as described by the flowchart in [ f : mars - flowchart ] .",
    "this software is available by request to the authors .",
    "a skeletal mechanism is generated as a collection of elementary reactions in the standard chemkin format  @xcite , which may be easily used with any chemical kinetics platform .",
    "in contrast , a reduced mechanism requires a custom subroutine for evaluating the non - qss species production rates along with the qss species concentrations .",
    "more implementation details involving reduced mechanisms may be found in , e.g. , chen  @xcite or sung et al .",
    "first , we compared the performance of the initially informed and greedy sensitivity analysis algorithms in drgepsa . for the hcci - like set of conditions , these algorithms resulted in skeletal mechanisms with 344 species and 1645 reactions , and 233 species and 1061 reactions , respectively , with maximum errors of and ( based on the set of initial conditions given in [ t : conditions ] ) .",
    "in addition , we validated the ignition delay predictions of both skeletal mechanisms over the full target range of conditions ; both mechanisms performed well , as shown in [ f : hcci - sa - mechs - phi-1.0 ] using @xmath83 = 0.5 for the llnl gasoline surrogate in air .",
    "the greater extent of reduction of the greedy sensitivity analysis  removing nearly 100 species more than the initially informed algorithm  while retaining a similar level of performance suggest the usefulness of the algorithm .    .set of initial conditions used to generate skeletal mechanisms for the llnl gasoline surrogate .",
    "adopted from that used by mehl et al .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : hightemp - results ] summarizes the results of each reduction stage .",
    "the drgep algorithm automatically selected a cutoff threshold of , and as mentioned above we set @xmath84 for the ( greedy ) sensitivity analysis upper threshold .",
    "the unimportant reaction elimination algorithm iteratively selected a cutoff threshold for reactions of .",

    "based on the mechanism reductions performed in this work , we can make several suggestions for setting these values :    * the upper threshold for sensitivity analysis can be set to a high value , such as 0.5 , when using the greedy algorithm combined with autoignition and psr data . *",
    "the csp characteristic time scale safety factor should be set to a value ( e.g. , 100 ) large enough to significantly separate the time scales of the fast modes from that of the system . *",
    "the csp cutoff threshold should be set at a lower value , such as , than indicated previously  @xcite .",
    "* the qss graph cutoff threshold should be set to a small but nonzero value such as 0.01 to sufficiently trim the graph to prevent extremely long and complex expressions in the analytic qss species concentration solution .",
    "however , additional investigation is warranted for the development of an automated , robust selection approach for the optimal csp cutoff threshold based on , e.g. , the maximum contributions of the nonlinear qss terms ; the ad hoc , manual selection method used previously may result in a poorly performing reduced mechanism under certain conditions .",
