    "the farey map is an example of so - called _ intermittent maps _ with an infinite absolutely continuous invariant measure ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a map is _ intermittent _ if roughly speaking , its orbits alternate regular and chaotic behavior . in the maps @xmath2\\to[0,1]$ ] studied in @xcite , this is caused by the existence of a non - hyperbolic fixed point of the map @xmath3 at the origin , that is @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 for all @xmath7 .",
    "many ergodic properties fail for intermittent maps , for example the decay of correlations occur at a polynomial rate instead of the exponential rate typical of expanding maps , for which @xmath8 for all @xmath9 . moreover if @xmath10 as @xmath11 for @xmath12 , then the unique invariant measure @xmath13 , which is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , is finite if and only if @xmath14 .",
    "hence for @xmath15 we have to apply infinite ergodic theory ( @xcite ) , and the analysis is more delicate .",
    "the farey map corresponds to the case @xmath16 with invariant measure @xmath17 .    for intermittent maps with infinite invariant measures ,",
    "one of the problem is the study of the transfer operators associated to the map .",
    "this is a family of linear operators depending on a parameter @xmath18 , that when defined on a suitable space of functions are useful in the study of ergodic properties .",
    "for example for @xmath19 one obtains information about the existence of invariant measures , ergodicity and mixing ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the situation is much more delicate for systems with an infinite invariant measure .    in this paper",
    "we continue the study initiated in @xcite of the transfer operators associated to the farey map .",
    "in particular we consider the family of _ signed generalized transfer operators _ @xmath20 whose action on a function @xmath21\\to { \\mathbb c}$ ] is given by a weighted sum over the values of @xmath22 on the set @xmath23 , namely letting @xmath24 @xmath25 we have @xmath26 since the operators @xmath27 are defined by multiplication and composition by real analytic maps which extend to holomorphic maps on a neighbourhood of the interval @xmath28 $ ] , it is natural to consider the action of @xmath27 on the space of holomorphic functions on the open domain @xmath29 the study of the spectral properties of the operators @xmath27 has been considered in @xcite for real values of @xmath30 and in @xcite for complex @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "in particular in @xcite , the operators @xmath20 have been used for the extension of the results in @xcite to a two - variable selberg zeta function .    here",
    "we consider the case @xmath32 and pursue the analysis of the spectral properties of @xmath20 when acting on a suitable hilbert space . in section [ sec : spectrum ]",
    "we first revisit results from @xcite , amending in proposition [ spazi ] and corollary [ new - correct ] some results from @xcite .",
    "then in section [ sec : matrix ] we introduce an infinite matrix associated to @xmath20 , and use a result from @xcite to obtain an algorithm for the determination of the leading eigenvalue of @xmath27 . compared to similar results in @xcite ,",
    "our approach is direct , in the sense that we do nt need to use an induced map , and the eigenvalue can be found with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "in @xcite the spectral properties of @xmath27 are studied on the hilbert space @xmath33 of complex functions which can be represented in terms of the integral transform @xmath34(x):= \\frac{1}{x^{2q}}\\ \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\frac{t}{x}}\\ , e^t\\ , \\phi ( t)\\ , m_q(dt)\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the absolutely continuous measure on @xmath36 defined as @xmath37 hence the operators @xmath27 are studied on the space @xmath38(x)\\ : \\",

    "in @xcite it is shown that @xmath40 is naturally continuously embedded in @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is as in and @xmath41 is the space of holomorphic functions endowed with the standard topology induced by the family of supremum norms on compact subsets of @xmath42 . a first result from @xcite states    [ lilla ] for @xmath32",
    "the space @xmath40 is invariant for @xmath20 and @xmath43 are isomorphic to self - adjoint compact perturbations of the multiplication operator @xmath44 given by @xmath45 more specifically @xmath46 = { { \\mathcal b}}_q\\ , [ p_{q}^\\pm   \\varphi]\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the symmetric integral operator given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the bessel function of order @xmath51 .",

    "the study of the spectral properties of @xmath27 on the space @xmath33 , is then reduced to study of the spectral properties of the operators @xmath66 defined in theorem [ lilla ] on the space @xmath67 . to this aim",

    "hence we now restrict to the operators @xmath179 and numerically analyze the convergence of the sum in for the eigenvector @xmath139 corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue .    by proposition [ autoval - gen ] , for any fixed value @xmath178 we find @xmath182 , which gives an approximation of the first @xmath178 components of @xmath139",
