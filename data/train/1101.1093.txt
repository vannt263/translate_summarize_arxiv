    "a more detailed discussion of the angst program can be found in @xcite .",
    "we constructed the initial list of angst galaxies based on the catalog of neighboring galaxies @xcite , consisting exclusively of galaxies located beyond the zero velocity surface of the lg @xcite .",
    "we selected potential targets with @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 to avoid observational difficulties associated with low galactic latitudes . by simulating cmds and crowding limits",
    ", we found that a maximum distance of @xmath2 3.5 mpc provides the optimal balance between observational efficiency and achieving the program science goals . because the sample of galaxies within 3.5 mpc contains predominantly field galaxies",
    ", we chose to extend the distance limits in the direction of the m81 group .",
    "this extension added to the diversity of galaxies in the sample , while maintaining the goal of observational efficiency , due to the m81 group s close proximity to the fiducial distance limit ( d@xmath10 @xmath2 3.6 mpc ) and low foreground extinction values .",
    "similarly , we also included galaxies in the direction of the ngc 253 clump ( d@xmath11 @xmath2 3.9 mpc ) in the sculptor filament @xcite , further extending the range of environments probed by the sample , while maintaining strict volume limits for galaxy selection .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a sample of 60 angst dwarf galaxies from both new and comparable quality archival imaging .",
    "the galaxies range in m@xmath5 from @xmath128.23 ( kk  230 ) to @xmath1217.77 ( ngc  55 ) and in distance from 1.3 mpc ( sex  a ) to 4.6 mpc ( ddo  165 ) .",
    "we have included most galaxies considered dwarf galaxies in the literature in our analysis , although the upper mass / luminosity cutoff for what constitutes a dwarf galaxy is somewhat ambiguous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite chose to exclude the lmc ( @xmath13 @xmath1217.93 ) and smc ( @xmath13@xmath1216.35 ) from the ` dwarfs ' category .",
    "analogous to @xcite , we have not included ngc  3077 ( @xmath13@xmath1217.44 ) , ngc  2976 ( @xmath13 @xmath1216.77 ) , and ngc  300 ( @xmath13 @xmath1217.66 ) , which would be among the brightest and most massive galaxies in the sample .",
    "detailed studies of the sfhs of ngc  2976 @xcite and ngc  300 @xcite are available in the literature . a full list of sample galaxies and their properties are listed in table [ tab1 ] with the distances and blue luminosities of the sample shown in figure [ sample ] .",
    "although the sample of angst dwarf galaxies is extensive , it is not complete within a fixed distance limit .",
    "galaxies at low galactic latitudes have been intentionally excluded from the original volume selection to avoid complications associated with high degrees of reddening . while sfhs can still be derived from cmds of such galaxies ( e.g. , ic  4662 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effects of extreme reddening can lead to larger uncertainties and can require special analysis techniques ( e.g. , individual stellar line of sight reddening corrections ) , which detracts from a uniform approach to the data reduction .",
    "in addition there have been a number of recently discovered dwarf galaxies in the m81 group @xcite , which were not discovered in time to be included in the original angst sample .",
    "the recent distance reassignment of ugc  4879 to the periphery of the lg @xcite meant this galaxy has also been excluded from the angst sample .",
    "further , the angst sample is likely to be missing any faint dsphs which might be located in close proximity to m81 , i.e. , analogs to milky way satellites such as draco and ursa minor , as such galaxies have not yet been detected due to their inherent faintness . at a distance of m81 ( 3.6 mpc )",
    "draco and ursa  minor would have apparent blue luminosities of 18.98 and 20.13 , respectively . in comparison ,",
    "sc22 ( @xmath14 @xmath15 17.72 ) has the faintest apparent magnitude in the angst sample .    in this paper",
    ", we initially divide the sample of dwarf galaxies according to morphological type , @xmath16 , @xcite resulting in 12 dwarf galaxies with @xmath16 @xmath17 0 ( dsphs ) , 5 with @xmath16 @xmath15 8 or 9 ( dwarf spirals ; dspirals ) , and 43 with @xmath16 @xmath15 10 ( dis ) .",
    "for ease of direct comparison with well studied lg dwarf galaxies , we have adopted nomenclature consistent with @xcite , in which dwarf ellipiticals ( e.g. , ngc  147 , ngc  185 ) are found to be rare , and dsphs are more common . among the dis , there could be some ambiguity between bright dis and dspirals . for consistency , we defer to the @xmath16-type morphological classification scheme , but note that the distinction between a bright di and dspiral is not always clear .",
    "morphological type @xmath16 @xmath15 10 further includes transition dwarf galaxies ( dtrans ) , galaxies with reduced recent star formation but high gas fractions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and tidal dwarf galaxy candidates ( dtidals ) , which appear to be condensing out of tidally disturbed gas .",
    "we classify subtypes , i.e. , dtidal and dtrans , as follows : the three dtidals are holmberg ix , a0952 + 069 , and bk3n , and are all located in the m81 group . for dtrans , we adopt the definition of @xcite , namely , that a galaxy has detectable gas but very little or no h@xmath18  flux .",
    "the final sample of dtrans was classified based on hi  and h@xmath18  measurements in the literature @xcite .",
    "we find 12 angst dwarf galaxies that satisfy the dtrans criteria : kk  230 , antlia , kkr  25 , kkh  98 , kdg  73 , eso294 - 10 , eso540 - 30 , eso540 - 32 , kdg  52 , eso410 - 005 , ddo  6 , and ugca  438 , leaving the final tally of true dis at 28 .",

    "prior to the failure , we observed new targets using acs with wfpc2 in parallel mode .",
    "galaxies observed post - acs failure were imaged with wfpc2 alone , as part of a ` supplemental ' hst program ( proposal ids 11307 and 11986 in table [ tab1 ] ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "new acs observations used the f475w ( sdss @xmath25 ) and f814w ( @xmath26 ) filter combination , to optimize both photometric depth and temperature ( color ) baseline .",
    "a third filter in f606w ( wide @xmath27 ) is also available for most galaxies .",
    "the low throughput in the bluer filters of wfpc2 led us to only use f606w and f814w for wfpc2 observations .",
    "as described in @xcite , both new and archival observations were processed uniformly beginning with image reduction via the standard hst pipeline . using the angst data reduction pipeline , we performed photometry on each image with hstphot @xcite , designed for wfpc2 images , and dolphot , running in its acs - optimized mode , for acs observations , providing for a uniform treatment of all data .",
    "the resultant photometry for each data set was filtered to ensure the final photometric catalogs excluded non - stellar objects such as cosmic rays , hot pixels , and extended sources .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we considered a star well measured if it met the following criteria : a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath8 4 in both filters , a sharpness value such that ( @xmath28 @xmath19 @xmath29)@xmath30 @xmath17 0.075 , and a crowding parameter such that ( @xmath31 @xmath19 @xmath32 ) @xmath17 0.1 . to characterize observational uncertainties , we performed 500,000 artificial star tests on each image .",
    "both the full and filtered ( i.e. , the ` gst ' files ) photometric catalogs , hst reference images , and cmds are publicly available on mast .",
    "definitions and detailed descriptions of the filtering criteria and the observational strategies can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    because of the variety of distances in the sample",
    ", the acs / wfpc2 field of view does not subtend the same physical area for each galaxy . for certain comparisons among the sample ( e.g. , integrated stellar masses ) ,",
    "it is important to account for these differences in coverage area . to that effect",
    ", we employ a simple areal normalization factor based on each galaxy s apparent blue surface brightness . from the measurements listed in table 4 of @xcite",
    ", we consider an effective elliptical area computed using the angular diameter and angular axial ratios at a blue surface brightness level of @xmath2 25 mag arcsec@xmath33 ( @xmath2 26.5 mag arcsec@xmath33 in the case of the faintest galaxies ) .",
    "we then calculate the normalization factor , @xmath34 , for each galaxy by taking the ratio of the angular area subtended by the acs/ wfpc2 field of view to the angular area computed from @xcite .",
    "this normalization has been specifically applied to the integrated stellar masses throughout this study .",
    "the @xmath34 normalizations are typically @xmath8 1 ( i.e. , the hst field of view exceeds the area computed by @xcite ; see table [ tab1 ] ) , and the most and least covered galaxies are bk3n ( 18.0 ) and ngc  55 ( 0.02 ) , respectively .    in most cases ,",
    "a single hst field was sufficient to cover the main optical body of a galaxy , ensuring the sfhs are representative of the whole galaxy . however , several of the sample galaxies required multiple observations to cover a reasonable fraction of the optical body ( ngc  2366 , holmberg ii , ic  2574 , ngc  55 , bk5n , f8d1 , ngc  3109 ) . to derive the sfhs for each of these galaxies",
    ", we first checked to see that the 50% completeness limits for each of the fields were similar ( i.e. , within @xmath350.2 mag ) .",
    "this condition was met for all galaxies except ic  2574 , ngc  55 , and ngc  3109 , which have large angular sizes and wide ranges of surface brightnesses within each galaxy . for galaxies with similar completeness limits , the photometry and false stars were first combined , and then the sfh code was run on the combined data . for galaxies with overlapping fields ( ngc  2366 , holmberg ii ) we carefully removed duplicate stars before merging the photometry .",
    "ic  2574 was a special case as it has three overlapping fields with significantly different completeness limits .",
    "in this instance , we first removed the duplicate stars from overlapping fields , ran the sfhs on each field , and then combined the results .",
    "ngc  55 and ngc  3109 have many new and archival hst observations taken over multiple visits . in each case",
    ", we selected representative non - overlapping fields , one in the center of the galaxy and one in the disk .",
    "the completeness functions were sufficiently different such that we did not combine photometry prior to computing the sfh . instead , we derived the sfhs for each field separately , and combined the resultant sfhs from each field .",
    "the fractional coverage listed in table [ tab1 ] takes into account the combined areas for galaxies with multiple fields .",
    "to ensure uniformity in the sfhs of the angst dwarf galaxies , we selected one sfh code @xcite and one set of stellar evolution models ( padova ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sfh code of @xcite provides the user with robust controls over critical fixed input variables , e.g. , imf , binary fraction , time and cmd bin sizes , as well as the ability to search for the combination of metallicity , distance , and extinction values that produce a model cmd that best fits the observed cmd .",
    "the models of @xcite combine updated asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) evolution tracks with the models of @xcite ( @xmath36 @xmath37 7 m@xmath38 ) and @xcite ( @xmath36 @xmath6 7 m@xmath38 ) . as with any models , there may be inevitable systematic biases associated with these particular choices ( e.g. , at some metallicities the padova model rgbs have red offsets from observations ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , these systematic effects will be shared by all galaxies in the sample , making for a robust relative comparison within the sample .",
    "we discuss systematic uncertainties due to choice of isochrones in appendix [ systematics ] .    here , we briefly summarize the technique of measuring a sfh based on the full methodology described in @xcite .",
    "the user specifies an assumed imf and binary fraction , and allowable ranges in age , metallicity , distance , and extinction .",
    "photometric errors and completeness are characterized by artificial star tests . from these inputs ,",
    "many synthetic cmds are generated to span the desired age and metallicity range .",
    "for this work , we have used synthetic cmds sampling stars with age and metallicity spreads of 0.1 and 0.1 dex , respectively .",
    "these individual synthetic cmds are then linearly combined along with a model foreground cmd to produce a composite synthetic cmd .",
    "the linear weights on the individual cmds are adjusted to obtain the best fit as measured by a poisson maximum likelihood statistic ; the weights corresponding to the best fit are the most probable sfh .",
    "this process can be repeated at a variety of distance and extinction values to solve for these parameters as well .",
    "monte carlo tests were used to estimate uncertainties due to both random and systematic sources . for",
    "each monte carlo run , a poisson random noise generator was used to create a random sampling of the best - fit cmd .",
    "this cmd was then processed identically to the original solution , with additive errors in @xmath39 and @xmath40 introduced when generating the model cmds for these solutions .",
    "single shifts in @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) are used for each monte carlo draw , and the errors themselves were drawn from normal distributions with 1-@xmath41 values of 0.41 ( @xmath39 ) and 0.03 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "these distributions were designed to mimic the scatter in sfh uncertainties obtained by using multiple isochrone sets to fit the data , though we prefer to use this technique due to the small number of isochrone sets that fully cover the range of ages , metallicities , and evolutionary states required to adequately model our cmds .",
    "we found that the uncertainties were stable after 50 monte carlo tests , and thus conducted 50 realizations for each galaxy .",
    "this technique of estimating error on sfhs is described in greater detail in @xcite .    to minimize systematic effects for comparisons among the sample , we selected consistent parameters for measuring sfhs of all galaxies .",
    "all sfhs were measured using a single slope power law imf with a spectral index of @xmath121.30 over a mass range of 0.1 to 120 m@xmath38 , a binary fraction of 0.35 with a flat secondary mass distribution , 71 equally spaced logarithmic time bins ranging from @xmath42 @xmath15 6.610.15 , color and magnitude bins of 0.05 and 0.1 mag , and the padova stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "we note that the difference between our selected imf and a kroupa imf @xcite is negligible , as the angst cmds are limited to stellar masses @xmath4 0.8 m@xmath38 .",
    "we designated the faint photometric limit to be equal to the 50% completeness limit in each filter ( see table [ tab1 ] ) as determined by @xmath2 500,000 artificial star tests run for each galaxy .",
    "the sfh program was initially allowed to search for the best fit distance and extinction values without constraints .",
    "initial values for the distances were taken from the trgb distances measured in @xcite , while foreground extinction values were taken from the galactic maps of @xcite .",
    "we found no significant discrepancies between the assumed values and the best cmd fit distance and foreground extinction values , i.e. , all were consistent within error .",
    "final solutions were computed using the trgb distances from @xcite and @xcite and foreground extinction values from @xcite .",
    "we placed an additional constraint on the cmd fitting process , namely that the mean metallicity in each time bin must monotonically increase toward the present .",
    "the deepest angst cmds do not reach the ancient ms turnoff , a requisite feature for completely breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy of the rgb only using broadband photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , sfhs derived from shallow cmds without a metallicity constraint can often have accompanying chemical evolution models that are unphysical ( e.g. , a drop in metallicity of several tenths of a dex over sub - gyr time scales ) .",
    "a more robust analysis of the chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies would need to include the ancient ms , measured gas phase abundances , and/or individual stellar spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore consider analysis of the metallicity evolution of the angst sample beyond the scope of this paper .    as an example of a typical cmd fit made by the sfh code , we compare the observed and synthetic cmds of a representative angst dtrans , ddo  6 ( figure [ fit ] ) .",
    "@xcite determined the trgb distance of ddo  6 to be 3.31@xmath350.06 mpc while the foreground extinction maps of @xcite give values of a@xmath5 @xmath15 0.07 and a@xmath43 @xmath15 0.06 . allowing the sfh code to search for the best fit cmd , we find best fit values of d @xmath15 3.31@xmath350.07 mpc and a@xmath44 @xmath15 0.05@xmath350.04 , both in excellent agreement with the independently measured values .",
    "examining the residual significance cmd , i.e. , the difference between the data and the model weighted by the variance ( panel ( d ) of figure [ fit ] ) , we see a good , although not perfect fit . notably , the area between the blue helium burning stars and young ms appears to be too cleanly separated in the model , which could be due to differential extinction affecting young stars in the observed cmd .",
    "additionally , the model red helium burning stars are too blue compared to the data , likely due to uncertainties in the massive star models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , even the most discrepant regions are fit within @xmath35 5@xmath41 , which are indicated by black or white points .",
    "overall , the model cmd appears to be in good agreement with the observed cmd , indicating that we have measured a reliable sfh .",
    "see @xcite for a full discussion of the quality measures of this cmd fitting technique .    in general , uncertainties in the absolute sfhs",
    "generally are somewhat anti - correlated between adjacent time bins , such that if the sfr is overestimated in one bin , it is underestimated in the adjacent bin . however , cumulative sfhs , i.e. , the stellar mass formed during or previous to each time bin normalized to the integrated final stellar mass , do not share this property , and thus present a more robust way of analyzing sfhs .    in",
    "the following sections , we consider sfhs plotted versus two different time binning schemes . for the individual galaxies ( figure [ sfh1 ] ) , we present the cumulative sfhs at the highest time resolution possible . errors in the cumulative sfhs presented at this time resolution indicate both the uncertainty in the fraction of total stellar mass formed prior to a given time , and the inherent time resolution for the sfh of that particular galaxy .",
    "a coarser time binning scheme is used for the absolute sfhs of the individual galaxies as well as the mean absolute and cumulative sfhs across the angst sample . in appendix",
    "[ appena ] , we determine that six broad time bins of of 0 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 2 - 3 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 10 , and 10 - 14 gyr provide an optimal balance between photometric depths and age leverage contained in the cmds of the angst dwarfs .",
    "the broader time bins allow us to securely average the best fit sfhs from individual galaxies .",

    "inspection of the hst based cmd suggests that ddo  113 resembles a prototypical dsph , with a handful of relatively faint blue stars , suggesting it is also likely a dsph or a dtrans .",

    "two of the dis ( ic  5152 and ddo  125 ) are isolated and relative massive , yet have moderate gas fractions .",

    "what follows , we consider the impact of putative gas loss mechanisms on the evolution of a typical gas - rich dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , with both @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath2 10@xmath72 m@xmath38 ) in the context of figure [ masses ] .",
    "the first mechanism for gas removal is consumption through sf .",
    "this process will increase the stellar mass and decrease the gas mass of our prototypical di , moving it to the right on figure [ masses ] . though sf can consume large amounts of a galaxy s gas reservoir",
    ", the gas densities will eventually become too low to continue to form stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that if consumption was the only mechanism , we should observe trace amount of gas in dsphs , which is not typically the case .    in the event that gas density was not a limiting factor , characteristically low sfrs and sf efficiencies in dwarf galaxies",
    "( @xmath2 1% ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply long gas consumption timescales . in this event",
    ", gas supplies would typically not be exhausted for more than a hubble time , which suggests that dsphs would be quite rare .",
    "in addition , gas consumption does not have a dependence on the environment external to a galaxy .",
    "thus , it can not account for the observed morphology ",
    "density relationship .",
    "although sf is a critical process to galaxy evolution , it can not be responsible for the complete removal of gas from dwarf galaxies .",
    "the second possible mechanism for removing gas is stellar feedback .",
    "mechanical energy due to stellar winds and supernovae provide an appealing explanation for gas removal from a galaxy via expulsion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the prototypical gas - rich di , this process removes gas with minimal effect on stellar mass , moving the galaxy straight down in figure [ masses ] .",
    "several feedback models can reproduce observed dwarf galaxy relationships between mass , luminosity , and rotational velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , these models are generally able explain the observed mass  metallicity relationship for dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although these models hold promise , there are two significant challenges to gas removal in dwarf galaxies due to feedback .",
    "first , a number of simulations have demonstrated that the energy due to stellar feedback is insufficient to completely expel cold gas ( e.g. , hi ) from the gravitational potential of a typical dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , stellar feedback alone can not explain the morphology  density relationship .",
    "similar to the rationale for gas consumption through sf , stellar feedback is not dependent on the environment surrounding a galaxy .",
    "thus , while sf and stellar feedback are primary drivers of dwarf galaxy evolution , it is unlikely that either or both are able to account for the final transition from a gas - rich to a gas - poor state .",
    "the third mechanism we consider is ram pressure stripping .",
    "@xcite first proposed that dsphs were once gas - rich dwarfs whose gas supply has been removed by ram pressure stripping from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this mechanism has negligible impact on stellar mass loss , thus moving our prototypical di straight down in figure [ masses ] .",
    "satellite galaxies in higher density environments would likely encounter a denser igm , which would lead to more efficient gas loss .",
    "this provides a feasible explanation for the observed morphology - density relationship .    despite the appeal of this mechanism",
    ", there is a distinct lack of observational evidence of systematic ram pressure stripping of lg dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite find that ram pressure stripping appears to be a localized phenomena , and only evident for a small minority of lg dwarfs .",
    "however , given that the lg is in a state of relatively passive evolution , it could be that signatures of ram pressure stripping have been erased in many satellites .",
    "an additional challenge comes from the magnitude of ram pressure stripping .",
    "@xcite demonstrate the ram pressure stripping is unlikely effective enough to completely remove the gas supply of a dwarf galaxy in the lg .",
    "it appears that ram pressure stripping is not able to account for complete gas loss in dwarf galaxies .",
    "we next consider tidal effects on gas removal from dwarf galaxies . the close passage of a dwarf galaxy to a massive companion has strong gravitational effects on the gas , stellar , and dark matter contents of the smaller galaxy . as shown in @xcite , the magnitude of the tidal force during an interaction does not appear to be enough to remove the gas content from a gas - rich di . instead",
    ", @xcite advocate a more complex approach in which a combination of ram pressure stripping and stellar mass loss due to tidal effects provide a plausible model , ` tidal stirring ' , for the transformation of gas - rich dis into gas - poor dsphs .",
    "in this scenario , the prototypical gas - rich di is able to lose both stellar and gas mass , allowing it to move down and left in figure [ masses ] , meaning a di with a high stellar mass could be transformed into a less massive dsph .",
    "predictions from tidal stirring models provide qualitative explanations for a number of trends seen in the angst sample .",
    "foremost , tidal stirring naturally produces a morphology  density relationship .",
    "galaxies in lower density environments have had few ( or no ) interactions with massive galaxies , and are able to maintain high gas fractions .",
    "this is in general agreement with the trends seen in figure [ thbary ] . of the galaxies",
    "that do interact with a massive companion , tidal stirring predicts that stellar and gas mass loss happens progressively over several gyr ( a single complete orbit in the lg is typically 1 - 2 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , these galaxies spend the majority of their life cycling between sf and stellar feedback . by extension , this implies that many dsphs and dis should not have drastically different sfhs , in general agreement with the sfhs of angst dwarf galaxies .",
    "while the general qualitative agreement between tidal stirring predictions and the angst sample is encouraging , a quantitative comparison between predictions and observed dwarf galaxy sfhs are needed to place precise constraints on the gas loss processes in dwarf galaxies .      with little evidence of recent sf , yet detectable amounts of hi , dtrans may hold clues to the transformation of gas - rich to gas - poor galaxies . synthesizing several previous studies",
    ", there are two favored scenarios for the origins of dtrans , namely that they are either in the last throes of sf or are observed during temporary lulls between episodes of massive star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dtrans in the angst sample have characteristics consistent with both scenarios . those with low gas fractions ( @xmath66/@xmath67 @xmath1 0.4 ; eso294 - 010 , es410 - 005 , and eso540 - 032 ) typically have positive tidal indices , indicating a higher likelihood of gas loss via interactions ( figure [ thbary ] ) .",
    "these three galaxies may be examples of galaxies genuinely transitioning from gas - rich to gas - poor states .",
    "in contrast , the most isolated dtrans ( kk  230 , kkh  98 , kkr  25 , and ua  438 ) typically have high gas fractions ( @xmath4 0.9 ) and stellar masses among the lowest in the angst sample ( figure [ bary ] ) . these dtrans have properties consistent with other low mass dis , and could simply be low mass dis lacking h@xmath18 , which can be attributed to a wide range of effects including temporary episodes between massive star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , a stochastically sampled or systematically varying imf ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and/or leakage of ionizing photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the remaining dtrans ( antlia , kdg  2 , ddo  6 , kdg  52 , kdg  73 ) appear to be have masses and tidal indices close to the genuinely transitioning group , but gas fractions similar to the low mass dis .",
    "it is possible that these galaxies may have had few interactions , resulting in less gas loss .",
    "detailed multi - wavelength studies of these galaxies could provide insight into gas loss mechanisms in dwarf galaxies .",
    "as the smallest and most pristine galaxies in the universe , dwarf galaxies occupy a critical , but poorly constrained role in cosmological models of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of their intrinsic faintness , dwarf galaxies have been difficult to directly detect at cosmologically significant redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as an alternate approach to observing high redshift dwarf galaxies , we present a comparison between the mean cumulative sfhs of the angst sample dwarfs and the cosmic sfh , as derived from observed uv fluxes in high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) . in the top panel of figure [ cum2 ]",
    ", we see good agreement between the cosmic sfh ( grey shaded region ) and the mean cumulative sfhs of the angst dwarf galaxies at z @xmath2 2 ( 10 gyr ago ) . at more recent times ,",
    "the cosmic sfh increases sharply , while the cumulative sfhs of dwarf galaxies increase at a slower rate .",
    "this comparison suggests that the largest differences between sfrs in dwarf galaxies and massive galaxies studied at higher redshifts are at intermediate and recent epochs .",
    "this finding is generally consistent with the expectations of galaxy ` downsizing ' , where high mass galaxies preferentially stop forming stars at higher redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". the precise role of dwarf galaxies in theories of downsizing is highly uncertain , making this result difficult to interpret in the context of current models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also caution that the physical significance of this finding is still ambiguous due to a several factors including uncertain agb star models and redshift dependent dust corrections applied to the cosmic sfh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a comparison of sfhs from the entire angst sample ( including the most massive galaxies ) and the cosmic sfh is presented in @xcite .",
    "the cumulative sfhs can also provide insight into the validity of model sfhs often used to describe the evolution of dwarf galaxies . as an illustrative example",
    ", we have selected a simple exponentially declining sf model ( sfr @xmath73 @xmath74 ; a @xmath75 model ) , and show the cumulative sfhs for a range of @xmath75 values ( grey shading ) in the lower panel of figure [ cum2 ] .",
    "visual inspection suggests that the measured sfhs show significant deviations from the predicted smooth curve of single @xmath75 valued models .",
    "a @xmath76@xmath30 test between the measured cumulative sfhs and exponentially declining sfh models ( with @xmath75 varying from 0.1 to 14.1 gyr ) confirms that any single value of @xmath75 does not accurately represent the data .",
    "similarly , the mean measured sfhs also are not well matched with a constant sfh ( i.e. , @xmath75 @xmath77 @xmath78 gyr ) or a single ancient epoch of sf followed ( @xmath75 @xmath1 0.1 gyr ) by passive galaxy evolution .",
    "instead more complex and multi - component models may better describe the lifetime sfhs of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we uniformly analyzed sfhs of 60 dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe based on observations and data processing done as part of the angst program . while the sfhs of individual galaxies are quite diverse , we find that the mean sfhs of the different morphological types are generally indistinguishable outside the most recent @xmath2 1 gyr . on average ,",
    "the typical dwarf galaxy formed @xmath2 50% of its stellar mass by z @xmath2 2 and 60% by z @xmath2 1 .    among the morphological types , the sfhs hint at divergence within the past few gyr ,",
    "although assigning a precise time to this phenomena is challenging due to uncertainties in agb star modeling and the modest time resolution afforded by the data .",
    "the clearest differences between the morphological types can been seen in the most recent 1 gyr , where the typical dsph , di , dtrans and dspiral formed @xmath2 2% , 8% , 4% , and 5% of their total stellar mass .",
    "the dwarf galaxies in the angst sample show a strong morphology  density relationship .",
    "this suggests that internal mechanisms , e.g. , stellar feedback , can not solely account for gas - loss in dwarf galaxies , as the corresponding models are unable to produce this observed relationship .",
    "instead , we find qualitative consistency with the model of ` tidal stirring ' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can broadly explain the extended sfhs as well as the observed morphology  density relationship .",
    "a comparison with the cosmic sfh reveals general good agreement between the independently derived sfhs . the slower rate of sf for dwarf galaxies at intermediate epochs may be tentative evidence of galaxy downsizing",
    ". however , broad uncertainties in extinction corrections and agb star models may be able to explain the offset .",
    "further , the mean measured sfhs are inconsistent with single valued exponential models of sf ( i.e. , @xmath75 models ) , and may require more complex or multi - component models .",
    "we also identify 12 dtrans in the sample , based on the literature definition of present day gas fraction and sf as measured by h@xmath18  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within this sample of dtrans",
    ", we find that galaxies with high gas fractions are associated with more isolated galaxies , while those with lower gas fractions are less isolated .",
    "this suggests that there are two mechanisms that can produce the observed dtrans characteristics : the isolated gas - rich galaxies are simply between episodes of sf due to the stochastic nature of sf in low mass galaxies , while the less isolated galaxies could be in the process of interacting with a more massive companion .",

    "meaningful comparison of sfhs across the angst sample requires a uniform time binning scheme .",
    "this necessitates balancing the wealth of information about the ancient and intermediate epochs from the deepest cmds ( e.g. , antlia ; 50% completeness of @xmath79 @xmath2 @xmath191.75 ) with the course leverage of the shallower cmds ( e.g. , ugc  4483 ; 50% completeness of @xmath79 @xmath2 @xmath121.7 ; see table [ tab2 ] ) . as a compromise between the two extremes",
    ", we fixed a sample - wide time binning scheme using a galaxy with a 50% completeness value near the median of the sample ( ddo  6 ; @xmath79 @xmath2 0 ) . to test for the optimal time resolution , we constructed cmds of single age stellar populations , convolved the simulated photometry with the artificial stars and photometric limits of ddo  6 , and ran the sfh recovery program on each of these simulated cmds .",
    "this process was conducted on single age cmds of 0.5 , 1.5 , 2.5 , 4.5 , 8 , and 12 gyr in age .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is to provide a simple test for the robustness of the final time bins .",
    "while coarser time bins encompass a larger fraction of the input sf , there are generally fewer of them , which provides less information about pattens of sf over time . in this test",
    ", we deemed a good recovery as one in which the input sfh was within the uncertainties of the recovered sfh . in figure",
    "[ frac_sf ] , we show the cumulative sfhs , where the input sf is indicated by the dashed magenta line and the recovered sfh by the solid black line .",
    "uncertainties were computed using 50 monte carlo realizations as described in ",
    "[ sfhs ] , including identical shifts in @xmath39 and @xmath80 .",
    "initial tests suggested that six broad time bins of 0 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 2 - 3 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 10 , 10 - 14 gyr would provide suitable time resolution across the angst sample .",
    "as shown in figure [ frac_sf ] , the general agreement between the input and recovered sfhs is good and falls within the uncertainties .",
    "clearly , the best recovery is seen in the 0 - 1 gyr bin , where the young ms and massive core and blue helium burning stars provide secure leverage on recent sf .",
    "the oldest bin also shows similarly good results .",
    "the results in the intermediate bins are generally reasonable , although not as reliable as the youngest and oldest bins .",
    "much of this can be attributed to uncertainties in agb star models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although , we used the same models to generate and recover the single age populations , photometric depth , systematic stellar model uncertainties , and blurring of distinct features due to observational effects all contribute to uncertainties in the recovered sfh ( see appendix [ systematics ] ) .",
    "agb populations of different ages often have similar colors and magnitudes on optical cmds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus it can be difficult to confidently determine the epoch of sf at intermediate ages ( 110 gyr ago ) .",
    "this limitation is clearly illustrated in figure [ frac_sf ] , which shows broad uncertainties on the recovered sfhs during intermediate times .",
    "however , we still find that the input sfhs are generally within the recovered sfh error bars .",
    "additionally , @xmath4 50% of the sf is recovered in the correct time interval . although it would be possible to combine bins at intermediate times to increase the accuracy of the recovered sfrs",
    ", we believe that this scheme will permit future comparisons with sfhs derived using improved agb star models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for this time binning scheme , we find that reported uncertainties in the sfrs typically decrease for cmds deeper than ddo  6 , and increase for shallower cmds , in agreement with expectations .",
    "we thus conclude that this scheme is adequate for comparison of sfhs across the angst sample .",
    "photometric depth is an important consideration when interpreting the accuracy of a measured sfh . varying photometric depths impact both the number of stars on a cmd and",
    "determine the presence of age sensitive cmd features ( e.g. , ancient ms turn - off , horizontal branch ) .",
    "intuitively , a cmd with a brighter photometric limit has less information available than a deeper cmd , and the derived sfh is thus more uncertain .",
    "however , quantifying the precise impact of these uncertainties , such as the amplitude and ages affected , is challenging as varying photometric depths can amplify effects of uncertainties in the stellar models used to measure sfhs . in this section",
    ", we explore the effects of photometric depth on the accuracy of sfh recovery .",
    "we demonstrate the effects in two regimes : one where the only variable is photometric depth , and the other where we vary both photometric depth and stellar evolution models .",
    "we first analyze the accuracy of recovered sfhs as a function of _ only _ photometric depth .",
    "that is , we construct synthetic cmds at select photometric depths , then attempt to recover the input sfh using identical parameters ( e.g. , imf , binary fraction , filter combination ) and , in this case , the same stellar evolution models .",
    "more concretely , we constructed cmds at six different photometric depths ( @xmath81 @xmath194 , @xmath192 , @xmath191 , 0 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , using a constant sfh ( @xmath827.4 - 10.15 , with a time resolution of @xmath2 0.1 dex ) , a fixed metallicity , and the basti stellar evolution models .",
    "each cmd was populated with @xmath2 10@xmath83 stars in order to minimize the contribution of random uncertainties due to the number of stars used to measure the sfr in each time bin ; for sfhs measured from observed cmds , the uncertainties for poisson sampling of the cmd are already well characterized by our monte carlo tests .",
    "we then recovered the sfh of each cmd using the basti stellar evolution models , to ensure that the only variable being tested is photometric depth .    in figure [ basbas_sf ] , we compare the input ( black lines ) and recovered ( colored lines ) cumulative sfhs at each photometric depth .",
    "overall , the recovered cumulative sfhs are in excellent agreement with the input sfhs at all photometric depths .",
    "the maximum deviation between the input and recovered sfhs at any photometric depth is @xmath2 4% , which is consistent with the expected poisson precision of 1/@xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the number of stars used to measure the sfr in a given time bin .",
    "this exercise demonstrates that if all the underlying stellar models are known exactly , then the accuracy of the recovered sfh only depends on the number of stars in the cmd , and not the photometric depth .",
    "the same results are found when using different stellar evolution models , e.g. , padova , dartmouth @xcite , to conduct this exercise .",
    "systematic uncertainties are introduced into sfh measurements by uncertainties in the selected stellar models .",
    "the luminosity , color , and number density of specific cmd features provide leverage on the sfr at different epochs .",
    "however , stellar models are not always self - consistent when trying to model multiple observed features ( e.g. , reproducing colors consistent with observations for both the horizontal branch and rgb ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the effect on a measured sfh is that the sfr may be systematically shifted into a particular time bin , depending on the stellar model used and photometric depth of the cmd ( i.e. , which particular age sensitive cmd features are available ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a comprehensive review on the adequacy of stellar evolution models for reproducing cmd features .    to test for systematic effects on",
    "measured sfhs , one ideally wants to test for differences between the stellar models and ` truth ' , that is , stellar population characteristics based on the exact physics governing stellar evolution in nature .",
    "however , current stellar evolution models represent the best physical descriptions we have of nature . by measuring how different stellar models impact a measured sfh",
    ", we can get a sense of the amplitude of systematic uncertainties for sfh recovery .    to examine the magnitude of systematic effects",
    ", we again construct six cmds at selected photometric depths each containing @xmath2 10@xmath83 stars , assuming a constant sfh , fixed metallicity , and the basti stellar evolution models .",
    "however , the sfhs are now recovered with the padova stellar models .",
    "thus , in this case the differences between the input and recovered sfhs are indicative of the systematic effects introduced by choice in stellar model .    in figure [ padbas_sf ]",
    ", we see the differences in the input ( black lines ) and recovered ( colored lines ) mean cumulative sfhs are more substantial than when identical models were used . for the deepest cmd considered ( @xmath86@xmath194 ) , the agreement between",
    "the input and recovered cmd is excellent . here",
    ", the ancient ms turnoff provides a reliable constraint on the ancient sfh , meaning the systematics in progressively younger time bins are also known more precisely . for shallower cmds that do not include the ancient ms turn - off , we see significant deviations between the recovered and input sfhs .",
    "these difference arise primarily in the treatment of such features of the horizontal branch , red clump , and rgb ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "we quantify the magnitude of the discrepancies between the padova and basti models by examining the absolute value of the differences in input and recovered cumulative sfhs ( figure [ diff_sf ] ) .",
    "of interest are the general order of magnitude variations , and not a specific point by point analysis . in the case of the shallowest cmds ( @xmath86@xmath122 , @xmath121 , 0 ) , the ancient sf",
    "is preferentially recovered at intermediate ages , with a typical magnitude in the difference of input and recovered sfh of @xmath2 20% .",
    "for the deeper cmds ( @xmath86@xmath191 , @xmath192 ) , sf at the oldest times tends to be over - estimated by up to @xmath2 40% . at all photometric depths , the systematic effects within the last @xmath2 2 gyr are @xmath1 10% .",
    "the exercises we have conducted demonstrate the importance of systematic uncertainties in sfh recovery . we caution that our results are actually measuring",
    "the systematic differences between the padova and basti models , and only serve a a proxy for the difference between a given model and ` truth ' , i.e. , observed cmds .",
    "that being said , the methodology of this type of analysis provides a framework for exploring the effects of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the primary limitation to this type of analysis is the number of models available that span the entire age / metallicity range needed to derive sfhs in nearby galaxies . as the number of models that sample a broader parameter space increases",
    ", it will be possible to gain more leverage on the effects of systematic uncertainties ."
