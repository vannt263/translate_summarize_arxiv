    "recent theoretical and experimental effort in quantum optics and quantum information has been focused on the engineering of highly nonclassical , non - gaussian states of the radiation field @xcite , in order to achieve either enhanced properties of entanglement or other desirable nonclassical features @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , at fixed covariance matrix , some of these properties , including entanglement and distillable secret key rate , are minimized by gaussian states @xcite . in the last two decades , increasingly sophisticated degaussification protocols have been proposed , based on photon addition or subtraction @xcite , and some of them have been recently experimentally implemented to engineer non - gaussian photon - added and photon - subtracted states starting from gaussian coherent or squeezed inputs @xcite .    progresses in the theoretical characterization and the experimental production of non - gaussian states are being paralleled by the increasing attention on the role and uses of non - gaussian entangled resources in quantum information and quantum computation with continuous - variable systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , concerning quantum teleportation with continuous variables @xcite , it has been demonstrated that the fidelity of teleportation can be improved by exploiting suitable deguassifications of gaussian resources @xcite .",
    "moreover , non - gaussian cloning of coherent states has been shown to be optimal with respect to the single - clone fidelity @xcite . determining the performance of non - gaussian entangled resources may prove useful in a number of concrete applications ranging from hybrid quantum computation @xcite to cat - state logic @xcite and , generically , in all quantum computation schemes based on communication that integrate together qubit degrees of freedom for computation with quantum continuous variables for communication and interaction @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate systematically the performance of different classes of entangled two - mode non - gaussian states used as resources for continuous - variable quantum teleportation . in our approach ,",
    "the entangled resources are taken to be non - gaussian _ ab initio _ , and their properties are characterized by the interplay between continuous - variable ( cv ) squeezing and discrete , single - photon pumping .",
    "our first aim is to determine the actual properties of non - gaussian resources that are needed to assure improved performance compared to the gaussian case . at the same time",
    ", we carry out a comparative analysis between the different non - gaussian cases in order to single out those properties that are most relevant to successful teleportation .",
    "finally , we wish to understand the role of adjustable free parameters , in addition to squeezing , in order to `` sculpture '' and achieve optimized performances within the set of non - gaussian resources .",
    "we will show that maximal non - gaussian improvement of teleportation success depends on the nontrivial relations between enhanced entanglement , suitably measured level of _ non - gaussianity _ , and the presence of a proper gaussian squeezed - vacuum contribution in the non - gaussian resources at large values of the squeezing ( squeezed - vacuum affinity ) .",
    "we limit the discussion to general issues of principle , considering the ideal situation of pure - state resources in the absence of noise and imperfections .",
    "detailed analysis of realistic situations with mixed - state resources in the presence of various sources of noise will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce and describe relevant instances of two - mode entangled non - gaussian resources , including squeezed number states and typical degaussified states currently considered in the literature , such as photon - added squeezed and photon - subtracted squeezed states .",
    "we show that all of the former , as well as the gaussian two - mode vacuum and squeezed vacuum ( twin - beam ) , can be seen as particular subcases of a properly defined class of _ squeezed bell - like states _ depending on a continuous angular parameter . in section iii , exploiting the unifying formalism of the characteristic function , we compare the relative performances of non - gaussian and gaussian resources in the braunstein - kimble cv teleportation protocol for different ( single - mode ) input states , gaussian and non - gaussian , including coherent and squeezed states , number states , photon - added coherent states , and squeezed number states . in section",
    "iv we consider the optimization of non - gaussian performance in cv teleportation with respect to the extra angular parameter of squeezed bell - like states .",
    "we show that maximal teleportation fidelity is achieved using a form of squeezed bell - like resource that differs both from squeezed number and photon - added / subtracted squeezed states . in section",
    "v we identify the properties that determine the maximization of the teleportation fidelity using non - gaussian resources .",
    "we find that optimized non - gaussian resources are those that come nearest to the simultaneous maximization of three distinct properties : the content of entanglement , the amount of ( properly quantified ) non - gaussianity , and the degree of _ `` vacuum affinity '' _ , i.e. the maximum , over all values of the squeezing parameter , of the overlap between a non - gaussian resource and the gaussian twin - beam .",
    "schemes for the experimental production of optimized squeezed bell - like resources are illustrated in section vi .",
    "finally , in section vii we present our conclusions and discuss some outlooks about the extension to other types of resources , optimized protocols , and applications to realistic situations in the presence of noise .",

    "therefore , a partial explanation of the better performance of squeezed bell - like resources lies in their higher degree of entanglement compared to other non - gaussian resources .",
    "however , from the graphs one can see that there are situations in which the entanglement of photon - added and/or subtracted resources is larger but , nevertheless , the fidelity of teleportation is still below the one associated to a squeezed bell - like resources .",
    "entanglement is thus not the only characterizing property in order to compare the performances of different non - gaussian resources .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is natural to look at a quantification of the non - gaussian character of different resources , in order to compare their performances .",
    "clearly , the subtle problem here is to define a reasonable `` measure '' of non - gaussianity , endowed with some nontrivial operative meaning .",
    "recently , inspired by the analysis of wolf , giedke , and cirac on the extremality of gaussian states @xcite at fixed covariance matrix , a measure of non - gaussianity has been introduced in terms of the hilbert - schmidt distance between a given non - gaussian state and a reference gaussian state with the same covariance matrix @xcite . given a generic state @xmath45 , its non - gaussian character can be quantified through the distance @xmath126 between @xmath45 and the reference gaussian state @xmath127 , defined according to the following relation : @xmath128}{2tr[\\rho^{2 } ] } = \\frac{tr[\\rho^{2}]+tr[\\rho_{g}^{2}]-2tr[\\rho \\rho_{g}]}{2 tr[\\rho^{2 } ] } , \\label{nongaussianity}\\ ] ] where , as already mentioned , the gaussian state @xmath127 is completely determined by fixing for it the same covariance matrix and the same first order mean values of the quadrature operators associated to state @xmath45 . using this definition , in fig .",

    "in fact , as expected , a ( squeezed ) number state must be more strongly non - gaussian than a ( squeezed ) superposition of the vacuum and of a fock state . in panel ii , we report the behavior of @xmath126 for the squeezed bell - like resources optimized for the teleportation of a coherent state input and a single - photon fock state input , i.e. , respectively with @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . for comparison ,",

    ", the squeezed photon - added and photon - subtracted squeezed states asymptotically tend to a squeezed bell state ( corresponding to @xmath134 ) , which has balanced gaussian and non - gaussian contributions .",
    "we have compared the non - gaussianity of the different resources according to a measure that is reference - dependent .",
    "one might think to define the measure according to an absolute reference . observing that the squeezed bell - like states and the photon - added / subtracted squeezed states are all obtained through a degaussification protocol from a pure squeezed state , one could modify the definition ( [ nongaussianity ] ) by taking the twin - beam @xmath135 @xmath136 as the universal reference gaussian state @xmath127 . adopting this modified definition , and observing that the non - gaussian states to be compared and the reference gaussian state are all pure , eq .",

    "however , it turns out that this modified definition provides results and information qualitatively analogous to those obtained by applying the original definition .",
    "there is still one property that plays a crucial role in the sculpturing of an optimized cv non - gaussian entangled resource . from figs .",
    "[ vonneumsbelloptcf ] and [ nongaussmeas ] we see that at sufficiently large squeezing the photon - added and photon - subtracted squeezed resources have entanglement comparable to that of the optimized squeezed bell - like states and , moreover , possess stronger non - gaussianity . yet ,",
    "even in this regime , they are not able to perform better than the optimized bell - like resources .",
    "this fact can be understood as follows , leading to the definition of the _ squeezed - vacuum affinity _ : it is well known that the gaussian twin - beam in the limit of infinite squeezing realizes exactly the cv version of the maximally entangled bell state in the case of qubits .",
    "these two ideal resources , respectively in the cv and qubit case , allow perfect quantum teleportation with maximal , unit fidelity .",
    "therefore , we argue that , even when exhibiting enhanced properties of non - gaussianity and entanglement , any efficient resource for cv quantum information tasks should enjoy a further property , i.e. to resemble the form of a two - mode squeezed vacuum , as much as possible , in the large @xmath14 limit .    the _ squeezed - vacuum affinity _ can be quantified by the following maximized overlap : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a two - mode squeezed vacuum with real squeezing parameter @xmath141 , and @xmath142 is any entangled two - mode resource that depends uniquely on the squeezing @xmath14 as the only free parameter .",
    "this definition applies straightforwardly to the photon - added and photon - subtracted squeezed resources , and as well to the squeezed bell - like resources after optimization with respect to the input state .",

    "[ overlaptwbres ] one observes that maximal affinity , and close to unity , is always and beautifully achieved , at large values of the squeezing parameter , by the optimized squeezed bell - like resources , while the lowest , constant affinity is always exhibited by the squeezed number states .    in conclusion , optimized squeezed bell - like resources are the ones that in all squeezing regimes are closest to the simultaneous maximization of entanglement , non - gaussianity , and affinity to the two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "the optimized interplay of these three properties explains the ability of squeezed bell - like states to yield better performances , when used as resources for cv quantum teleportation , in comparison both to gaussian resources at finite squeezing and to the standard degaussified resources such as the photon - added and the photon - subtracted squeezed states . in the next section",
    "we will discuss methods and schemes for the experimental production of squeezed bell - like entangled resources .",
    "while two - mode ( gaussian ) squeezed states are currently produced in the laboratory , the experimental generation of non - gaussian ( nonclassical ) states in quantum optics is still a hard task , as it requires the availability of large nonlinearities and/or the arrangement of proper apparatus for conditional measurements .",

    "a four - wave mixing process takes place in a crystal with third order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath146 .",
    "we consider two possible multiphoton interactions , in the travelling wave configuration , described by the following hamiltonians : @xmath149 where @xmath150 @xmath151 denotes three quantized modes of the radiation field .",
    "the complex parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153 are proportional to the third order nonlinearity and to the amplitude of an intense coherent pump field , treated classically in the regime of parametric approximation .",
    "the two - mode squeezed state seeds modes @xmath154 and @xmath155 ; mode @xmath156 is initially in the vacuum state @xmath157 ; mode @xmath158 is the classical pump . energy conservation and phase matching are assumed throughout .",
    "let us remark that , due to the typical orders of magnitudes of the third order susceptibilities , the parametric gains are very small @xmath159 .",
    "the propagation ( time evolution ) in the crystal yields @xmath160 @xmath161 . truncating the series expansion of the evolution operator at the first order in @xmath162 , we get @xmath163",
    "finally , a conditional measurement is performed on mode @xmath156 , consisting in a single - photon detection , i.e. a projection onto the state @xmath164 .",
    "the postselection reduces the states ( [ tevhint4wma ] ) and ( [ tevhint4wmb ] ) respectively to the states ( [ pas11 ] ) and ( [ pss11 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the low values of the parametric gains do not affect the implementation of the process .",
    "in fact , it is analogous to require low reflectivity of a beam splitter to generate photon - addition / subtraction by using linear optics .",

    "various examples of such simultaneous multiphoton processes have been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the final conditional measurement on mode @xmath156 yields the superposition state @xmath180 by applying a standard bogoliubov transformation and after a little algebra , it is straightforward to show that superposition state ( [ psisimuint ] ) reduces to the squeezed bell - like state ( [ squeezsuperpos ] ) if @xmath181 the latter conditions can be successfully implemented by observing that the complex parameters @xmath182 and @xmath183 can be controlled to a very high degree by means of the amplitudes of the external classical pumps .",
    "in this work we have presented a thorough comparison , with regard to the performance in continuous - variable quantum teleportation , between standard degaussified resources such as photon - added and photon - subtracted squeezed states and a new type of _ sculptured _ resource that interpolates between different degaussified states and can be optimized because it depends on an extra , relative - phase , independent free parameter in addition to squeezing .",

    "the squeezed bell - like states are those states that are as close as possible to the simultaneous maximization of entanglement , non - gaussianity , and affinity to the two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "the analysis performed in the case of pure - state resources can be extended to the case of mixed - state resources in the presence of noise , imperfections , and other sources of decoherence : we plan to report the results on the study of these situations in the near future .",
    "the concepts of hybridization , sculpturing , and optimization suggest that the present investigation could be extended and generalized along several directions .",
    "further optimization is in principle possible with respect to the local parts of the resource states , in analogy to the case of standard gaussian resources @xcite .",
    "one could think of extending the sculpturing to the entire basis of bell states , to generate entangled non - gaussian resources that can never be reduced to proper truncations of gaussian squeezed resources .",
    "such `` fully sculptured '' resources might allow for the further enhancement of the teleportation success due to the presence of a larger number of experimentally adjustable free parameters in addition to squeezing .",
    "fully sculptured states could be applied to hybrid schemes of teleportation combining continuous - variable inputs with discrete - variable resources and viceversa . in this framework ,",
    "a particularly appealing line of research would be to look for modified schemes of teleportation beyond the standard braunstein - kimble protocol , to be realized by generalized measurements in combination with state - control enhancing unitary operations .",
    "finally , the present discussion could be extended to other types of quantum information tasks and processes besides teleportation .",
