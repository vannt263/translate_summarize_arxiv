    "this review summarises the wide range of phenomena that occur in , or are associated with , energetic young radio pulsars .",
    "the scope is confined to rotation powered radio pulsars as accretion powered pulsars are discussed by others at this meeting .",
    "the level is introductory , providing the background for other speakers who discuss particular aspects in more detail . from here on rotation powered radio pulsars are referred to as pulsars and energetic young rotation powered radio pulsars are referred to as young pulsars . as a working definition we consider a pulsar with a characteristic age less than 100,000 years to be young .",
    "a key point to be emphasised is that many phenomena associated with young pulsars arise from the very high spin down energies that they deposit in their surroundings .",
    "the layout of this review is as follows :    @xmath0[s : prop ] basic properties of young pulsars + @xmath0[s : surv ] surveys for young radio pulsars + @xmath0[s : gli ] glitches , timing noise and braking indices + @xmath0[s : hen ] high energy observations + @xmath0[s : ism ] interstellar medium interactions + @xmath0[s : vel ] birth velocities + @xmath0[s : ass ] associations with supernova remnants",
    "the age of a pulsar with period @xmath1 and period derivative @xmath2 , is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rotation period at birth and @xmath5 is the braking index .",
    "@xmath4 can only be determined in a couple of special cases and it is generally assumed that @xmath6 . it is further assumed that magnetic dipole braking is the dominant braking force , for which @xmath7 . applying these assumptions to ( [ e : age ] ) gives the characteristic age @xmath8 .",
    "lines of constant characteristic age are shown in figure [ f : ppd ] and suggest that most pulsars are @xmath9 years old . in the middle at the top of figure",
    "[ f : ppd ] many of the young pulsars are shown with starred symbols which indicate that they are possibly associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the median values of a range of pulsar parameters are compared in table [ ypar ] for three populations of pulsars : young , normal and millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "the most noticeable unique features of young pulsars are the large spin down energies ( @xmath10 ) and their small distance ( @xmath11 ) from the galactic plane .",
    "this very low height above the galactic plane is striking ( figure [ f : gpy ] ) .",
    "they also appear to have slightly larger magnetic fields ( @xmath12 ) , dispersion measures ( dm ) ( and therefore distances , as shown in figure [ f : gfy ] ) and luminosities ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "however as can be seen in figure [ f : ledot ] , the scatter in the luminosities is large for the young pulsars , while the msps are more tightly clustered .",
    "the high spin down energies of both these population relative to the main population is also very clear in figure [ f : ledot ] .",
    "rather surprisingly the observed young population is now smaller than the observed msp population .",
    "the group of presently known young pulsars ( @xmath14 years ) are listed in table [ yng ] along with several of their important properties which are summarised in column eight .",
    "there are three very young pulsars with ages just over 1000 years , psrs b0531 + 21 ( crab ) and b150958 in the galaxy and psr b054069 which is one of the four known pulsars in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "psr j0633 + 1746 ( geminga ) is included in the list due to its similarity to radio pulsars , even though it has not been detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "most pulsars are born in or near the galactic plane where the progenitor population is located . since most young pulsars will not have had time to move very far from the galactic plane they too are found most abundantly in the galactic plane ( figure [ f : gpy ] ) .",
    "this has important implications for surveys for young pulsars , including some severe selection effects .",
    "we begin by discussing those which broaden the pulse profile .",
    "the importance of this can be seen from the fact that the sensitivity of a pulsar survey depends on the square root of the observed duty cycle of the pulsars it seeks to find ( @xcite ) .",
    "that is , a large duty cycle leads to a poorer sensitivity .",
    "dispersion smearing across individual frequency channels ( bhattacharya , these proceedings ) can be significant .",
    "for example , in the recent parkes survey ( @xcite ) the dispersion smearing of a pulsar with a dispersion measure of @xmath15 @xmath16pc would be 12.8ms .",
    "this smearing is strongly frequency dependent and is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the radio frequency at which the observations are made .",
    "if a frequency a factor of 3 higher is used , then dispersion smearing is reduced by a factor of 27 and the sensitivity potentially improved by a factor of 5 !",
    "this problem could also be overcome by using much narrower frequency channels , but the smearing caused by interstellar scattering can not ( bhattacharya , these proceedings ) . here",
    "the pulse broadening depends on @xmath19 , again suggesting that typical survey frequencies of @xmath20  mhz are not optimal for finding young pulsars . as young pulsars",
    "are relatively luminous , they may be found at large distances if the increased dispersion smearing and scattering can be countered by observing at high frequencies .    the frequency dependence of the sky background and the spectral indices of pulsars are also important to consider when designing a survey .",
    "the sky background temperature close to the galactic plane can be as high as 400k at 400mhz , completely dominating the receiver noise .",
    "however , between 400 and 1500mhz the sky background has a frequency dependence of @xmath21 , resulting in a background temperature of @xmath22k at 1400 mhz , comparable to a well optimised receiver .",
    "the flux detected from young pulsars typically depends on @xmath23 for frequencies between 400 and 1500mhz . while this means that the observed fluxes are smaller at higher frequencies , the dependence on frequency is flatter than the dependence for dispersion smearing , scattering and the sky background .",
    "a moderately high frequency search provides an optimal approach for finding young pulsars .",
    "such searches have already been undertaken ( @xcite ) and were very successful .",
    "they found a sample of 86 pulsars in a region of sky that had already been well searched at lower frequencies .",
    "the mean age of this sample is 10% of the mean age of the entire pulsar population .",
    "these two surveys are summarised together with three next generation high frequency surveys for young pulsars in table [ surv ] .",
    "the nancay survey is a collaboration between meudon , berkeley and naval research labs . and will provide excellent sensitivity to young pulsars , with vastly improved time and frequency resolution and limiting sensitivity .",
    "one of the difficulties of high frequency surveys is the slower sky coverage due to the smaller beam .",
    "for example a 1400mhz survey would take 12 times as long as a 400mhz survey to cover a given region with the same integration time and would collect substantially more data . at parkes and jodrell bank , a novel approach of using many simultaneous beams is being used to speed up the sky coverage . together with better receivers , this will improve the sensitivity by a factor of 5 - 10 for the same amount of telescope time per square degree as the clifton et al ( 1992 ) and johnston et al ( 1992 ) surveys .",
    "the corresponding longer integration time on each pointing means that acceleration searches will be necessary in order to find pulsars in fast binaries .",
    "in general , radio pulsars are excellent clocks , particularly the msps .",
    "there are however many pulsars which show substantial departures from a regular slow down , making the rotation unpredictable .",
    "these departures are manifest in two forms , sudden instantaneous spin ups called glitches and random walk wanderings called timing noise .",
    "both these effects are most prevalent in young pulsars , but do also occur in older pulsars .",
    "the unpredictability and randomness of these effects leads to considerable difficulties in determining braking indices . on the other hand they result from the dynamics of the interior of neutron stars and",
    "thereby provide a window through we can hope to peer into the interior .",
    "alpar ( these proceedings ) has discussed the nature and theories of glitches in detail .",
    "the basic properties of glitches include a step in rotation period of @xmath24 , a step in rotation period derivative @xmath25 and an exponential recovery ( @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity of @xmath26 for most glitches provides indisputable evidence both for the vortex pinning model and evidence against the crust cracking model ( alpar , these proceedings ) . long term regular monitoring of old favourites including the crab and vela has been continued and several new glitches have been observed ( @xcite ) including a giant glitch in psr  b1757@xmath2724 ( @xcite ) .",
    "some groups continue to monitor individual pulsars such as vela for up to 18 hours per day ( @xcite ) .    at the time of writing",
    ", 52 glitches have been observed in 21 pulsars .",
    "these 21 pulsars have a median age of 150,000 years , with 10 of them having ages less than the ( arbitrary ) 100,000 year boundary between young and other pulsars . of the 52 observed glitches ,",
    "40 have occurred in young pulsars , showing that young pulsars glitch more often than older pulsars .",
    "there have already been 21 glitches detected in the pulsars found in the high frequency surveys ( section [ s : surv ] ) .",
    "this large number of glitches has now allowed statistical studies which indicate that post - glitch relaxations can be separated into two exponential components for most pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "glitches are associated with high @xmath2 young pulsars and are rare .",
    "most of the pulsars that have glitched have done so only once , indicating that the time scale for glitches is long compared to the observation time scale of a few years .",
    "many of the pulsars near the top right of this plot have a negative @xmath28 which is an indication that these pulsars have glitched in the past ( @xcite ) . from an analysis of many glitches",
    "lyne ( 1996 ) also demonstrated that glitch activity peaks for pulsars with ages of @xmath29 years .",
    "timing noise is characterised by random walk phase wandering of the pulses relative to a simple slow - down model .",
    "timing noise is generally very red and the timing residuals relative to a simple slow - down model are often dominated by a cubic term .",
    "hence , the second time derivative of the period @xmath28 provides a simple way ( there are many others ) of measuring the amount of timing noise .",
    "timing noise is greatest in young pulsars with large @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "while most millisecond pulsars have very small period derivatives and are found to be very stable , psr b1937 + 21 , which has a relatively high @xmath2 for a millisecond pulsar , may have shown detectable timing noise ( @xcite ) .",
    "an enormous timing database ( equivalent to over 3500 years of data on a single pulsar ) has been collected at jodrell bank and is presently being analysed ( @xcite ) .",
    "this will allow a very complete understanding of timing noise and improve on previous studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the time span of data collected for a number of msps will soon be long enough to assess the extent to which timing noise occurs more generally in the fastest pulsars ( @xcite ) . in this respect",
    "the next few years should establish whether or not pulsars can really be used as long term standards of time .",
    "the second derivative of the period can be measured for many pulsars .",
    "the vast majority however , are corrupted by timing noise and are therefore not associated with steady spin down . as a result",
    "there are only four pulsars for which the measured braking indices ( @xmath5 ) are believed to be associated with the steady spin down ( @xcite ) : +"
