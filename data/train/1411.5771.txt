    "the cosmological principle and weyl s postulate appear to be essential ingredients in any physically realistic cosmological theory .",
    "together , they posit that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic ( at least on large , i.e. , @xmath21 mpc , spatial scales ) , and that this high degree of symmetry is maintained from one time slice to the next .",
    "the appropriate spacetime to use is conveniently and elegantly written in terms of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric though this , in and of itself , does not tell us much about the cosmic equation of state , relating the total energy density @xmath1 to its total pressure @xmath2 .    in principle ,",
    "if we knew these quantities precisely , we could then solve the dynamical equations governing the universal expansion and understand its large - scale structure and how it evolved to its current state .",
    "one could then also unambiguously interpret many of the observations , including the redshift - dependent luminosity distance to type ia sne and the spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "unfortunately , we must rely on measurements and intuition to pick @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the best we can do today is to assume that @xmath1 must contain matter @xmath5 and radiation @xmath6 , which we see directly , and an as yet poorly understand ` dark ' energy @xmath7 , whose presence is required by a broad range of data including , and especially , the aforementioned type ia sne @xcite .",
    "but instead of refining the cosmic equation of state , @xmath0 , the ever - improving measurements of the redshift - distance and redshift - age relations seem to be creating more tension between theory and observations , rather than providing us with a better indication of the dark - energy component , @xmath22 .",
    "for the other two constituents , one simply uses the prescription @xmath23 and @xmath24 , consistent with a fully relativistic fluid ( radiation ) on the one hand , and a non - relativistic fluid ( matter ) on the other .",
    "one of the most basic frw models , @xmath3cdm , assumes that dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath3 with @xmath25 , and therefore @xmath26 .",
    "this model does quite well explaining many of the observations , but growing empirical evidence suggests that it is inadequate to explain all of the nuances seen in cosmic evolution and the growth of structure .",
    "for example , @xmath3cdm can not account for the general uniformity of the cmb across the sky without invoking an early period of inflated expansion @xcite , yet the latest observations with _ planck _",
    "@xcite suggest that the inflationary model may be in trouble at a fundamental level @xcite .",
    "insofar as the cmb fluctuations measured with both wmap @xcite and _ planck _ are concerned , there appears to be unresolvable tension between the predicted and measured angular correlation function @xcite .",
    "and there is also an emerging conflict between the observed matter distribution function , which is apparently scale - free , and that expected in @xmath3cdm , which has a different form on different spatial scales .",
    "the fine tuning required to resolve this difference led watson et al .",
    "@xcite to characterize the matter distribution function as a ` cosmic coincidence . '",
    "such difficulties are compounded by @xmath3cdm s predicted redshift - age relation , which does not appear to be consistent with the growth of quasars at high redshift @xcite , nor the very early appearance of galaxies at @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to refine the basic @xmath3cdm model , or perhaps to eventually replace it if necessary , to improve the comparison between theory and observations . over the past several years",
    ", we have been developing another frw cosmology , known as the @xmath4 universe , that has much in common with @xmath3cdm , but includes an additional ingredient motivated by several theoretical and observational arguments @xcite . like @xmath3cdm , it also adopts the equation of state @xmath0 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , but is subject to the additional constraint that @xmath30 at all times .",
    "one might come away with the impression that these two prescriptions for the equation of state can not be consistent .",
    "but in fact if we ignore the constraint @xmath8 and instead proceed to optimize the parameters in @xmath3cdm by fitting the data , the resultant value of @xmath31 averaged over a hubble time is actually @xmath32 within the measurement errors @xcite . in other words , though @xmath26 in @xmath3cdm can not be equal to @xmath32 from one moment to the next , its value averaged over the age of the universe is equal to what it would have been in @xmath4 anyway .",
    "this result does not necessarily prove that @xmath3cdm is an incomplete version of @xmath4 , but it does seem to suggest that the inclusion of the additional constraint @xmath8 might render its predictions closer to the data . by now , comparative analyses of @xmath3cdm and @xmath4 have been carried out for a broad range of observations , from the cmb @xcite , high-@xmath33 quasars @xcite and the ages of high-@xmath33 objects @xcite in the early universe , to gamma - ray bursts @xcite and cosmic chronometers @xcite at intermediate redshifts and , most recently , to the relatively nearby type ia sne @xcite . in every case ,",
    "model selection tools indicate that the likelihood of @xmath4 being correct is typically @xmath9 compared with only @xmath10 for @xmath3cdm . and",
    "perhaps the most important distinguishing feature between these two cosmologies is that , whereas @xmath3cdm can not survive without inflation , the @xmath4 universe does not need it in order to avoid the well - known horizon problem @xcite .",
    "thus , an eventual abandonment of inflation should it fail to work self - consistently would completely tip the scale in favor of @xmath4 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to further develop the @xmath4 universe by addressing a rather obvious question that comes to mind . since @xmath3cdm lacks the ingredient @xmath8 that would turn it into @xmath4 , why does it in fact do quite well in accounting for many of the data ? and are there any other obvious observational consequences of the prescription @xmath34 for its equation of state ? here , we demonstrate that the inclusion of the condition @xmath8 in @xmath3cdm actually helps to explain why the fraction @xmath35 of its energy density in the form of ( visible and dark ) matter today must be @xmath36 in order for it to adequately fit the data . in other words , we will show that the inferred value of @xmath18 in @xmath3cdm is not random at all , but is instead uniquely required when one attempts to account for the observations using the equation of state @xmath34 in a universe that is in reality evolving according to the constraint @xmath37 .",
    "we will demonstrate this interesting and important connection between @xmath3cdm and @xmath4 in    2 and 3 , and discuss the results in   4 .",
    "the basic @xmath3cdm model avoids having to deal with uncertainties in the particle physics by relying on transitions , starting with an early radiation - dominated phase , followed by a universe dominated by matter after recombination , and then transitioning into a period dominated by dark energy . but",
    "in order to make testable predictions , we have to assume values for @xmath18 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and then integrate backwards to the big bang by solving the dynamics equations using the equation of state @xmath26 .",
    "if the universe is truly subject to the constraint @xmath8 at all times , however , how does this affect the observable signatures and inferred parameters of the standard model ?",
    "this is the question we will now attempt to answer .",
    "the friedmann - robertson - walker metric may be written @xmath40\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the cosmic time @xmath41 in the comoving frame , and the corresponding radial ( @xmath42 ) and angular ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) coordinates .",
    "the expansion factor @xmath45 is a function of @xmath41 only , whereas the spatial coordinates @xmath46 in this frame remain  fixed \" for all particles in the cosmos .",
    "the constant @xmath47 is @xmath48 for a closed universe , @xmath49 for a flat , open universe , or @xmath50 for an open universe .",
    "the source of spacetime curvature in a universe that satisfies the cosmological principle is a perfect fluid @xcite which , together with the metric coefficients appearing in equation  ( 1 ) , allows us to simplify einstein s equations and derive the key dynamical expressions governing the smoothed - out expansion at large scales .",
    "these include , respectively , the friedmann and energy - conservation equations , @xmath51 and @xmath52 both written in terms of the total energy density @xmath1 and total pressure @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath53 is the time - dependent hubble ` constant ' and an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to time @xmath41 .    in the @xmath4 universe , the ` active mass ' is zero , meaning that @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "therefore , from the definition of the gravitational radius @xmath55 , in terms of the misner - sharp mass @xmath56 @xcite , it is easy to show that @xmath57 , where @xmath58 @xcite , which yields @xmath4 ( the eponymous constraint of this model ) . and since the gravitational radius @xmath59 is a proper distance in this spacetime , one must also have @xmath60 ( see , e.g. , melia & shevchuk 2012 ) which , together with equation  ( 2 ) , then shows that @xmath61 .",
    "interestingly the cmb strongly constrains the total energy density to be near its critical value , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 @xcite , so the observations appear to be consistent with zero spatial curvature .",
    "though this empirical result emerges from the optimization of model parameters in @xmath3cdm , the fact that the standard model is often a good approximation to @xmath4 lends some observational support for this theoretical prediction of the @xmath4 cosmology . for these reasons",
    ", it will be sensible for us to assume a perfectly flat universe , and we will here always assume that @xmath61 .",
    "this also means that @xmath64 .",
    "our analysis in this paper will be based entirely on this premise .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to integrate equation  ( 2 ) , yielding @xmath65 to obtain this expression , we have allowed for the possibility that dark energy is not a cosmological constant ( i.e. , that @xmath19 may be different from @xmath50 , in which case we would refer to this model as wcdm , rather than @xmath3cdm ) , and we have used the derived value of the gravitational horizon to write @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this expression also assumes that @xmath67 at @xmath68 .",
    "equation  ( 4 ) must be satisfied by every flat frw cosmology , though the explicit dependence of the integrand on @xmath18 , @xmath38 , and @xmath69 shown here applies specifically to @xmath3cdm ( or wcdm if @xmath20 ) . however",
    ", if in fact the cosmological principle and weyl s postulate require the equation of state @xmath8 , then @xmath70 @xcite , so @xmath3cdm ( or wcdm ) would have no choice but to satisfy the condition @xmath71 let us now see what the consequences of this constraint are for @xmath3cdm .",
    "figure  1 shows the calculated value of this integral @xmath72 as a function of @xmath18 , for various dark - energy equations of state , @xmath19 .",
    "the radiation energy density is evaluated on the basis of the cmb s current temperature , @xmath73 k. not surprisingly , @xmath72 can have a broad range of values , but for any given @xmath19 , there is only one unique determination of @xmath18 that satisfies the condition @xmath74 . and",
    "for the special case of a cosmological constant ( @xmath17 ) , that value is @xmath75 .",
    "over the past decade , both @xmath18 and @xmath19 have been measured with relatively high precision , combining constraints from a variety of observational data sets .",
    "for example , @xcite combined data from six cmb experiments @xcite , from the power spectrum of large - scale structure in the 2df 100k galaxy redshift survey @xcite , from luminosity measurements of type ia sne @xcite , and from the hubble space telescope measurements of the hubble parameter @xmath76 .",
    "more recent analyses have refined the quantitative results from this extensive survey , though not altering the basic conclusions .",
    "it is therefore rather straightforward for us to compare our theoretical predictions directly with the observations . as we shall see shortly , the story emerging from this exercise is quite revealing .    none of the individual observations results in fits that are so precise as to produce unique values for the parameters @xmath77 .",
    "the reason for this is that , other than the sachs - wolfe effect @xcite , which is responsible for the largest angular fluctuations in the cmb , none of the other mechanisms producing structure of one kind or another depends sensitively on the expansion history of the universe . as such , some degeneracy exists among the possible choices of cosmological parameters pertaining to the cmb @xcite .    at lower redshifts ,",
    "the cosmological measurements are heavily influenced by the observation of type ia sne .",
    "but here also , both the luminosities and angular distances ( the fundamental observables ) depend on @xmath19 through multiple integrals , and are therefore not particularly sensitive to variations in @xmath19 with redshift @xcite .    0.2 in , calculated as a function of @xmath18 , according to @xmath3cdm ( or wcdm when @xmath78 ) .",
    "the label @xmath19 indicates the corresponding equation of state for dark energy , i.e. , @xmath22 , in terms of its pressure @xmath79 and density @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath70 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 must have the unique value @xmath75 ( indicated by the black dot).,title=\"fig : \" ]    nonetheless , all of the constraints derived from the various data sets do produce a well - defined region in @xmath80 phase space where the most likely values of these parameters are expected to be found .",
    "the confidence regions shown in figure  2 are adapted from a corresponding figure in @xcite .",
    "these show the @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 confidence regions corresponding to the type ia sne observations ( adapted from suzuki et al .",
    "2012 , shown as gray swaths ) , and the corresponding regions inferred from the analysis of cmb , hst , and 2df data ( indicated by the lighter - colored island regions to the upper left of this diagram ) .",
    "insofar as the values of @xmath19 and @xmath18 are concerned , the supernova data are not as constraining as the other sets , but there is clearly a satisfying consistency among all of the observations .",
    "also shown in figure  2 is one of the more interesting results of this paper , indicated here as a thick black curve to the left of this diagram .",
    "this feature shows the loci of @xmath84 points permitted by the requirement that the integral @xmath72 be equal to 1 ( see also figure  1 ) .",
    "that is , while the constraints shown in figure  2 are based on the interpretation of the data using @xmath3cdm , this theoretical curve goes one step further , by illustrating what values of @xmath19 and @xmath18 are actually permitted theoretically when we impose the additional constraint @xmath70 ( or , equivalently , the equation of state @xmath8 ) .",
    "notice , for example , where the latest measurement of @xmath18 and @xmath19 with planck fall on this diagram ( the star in figure  2 ) . whereas @xmath85 is linked to a dark - energy equation of state @xmath17 , the planck measurement of @xmath86 is associated with @xmath87 @xcite .    on its own",
    ", @xmath3cdm has no explanation for why the most preferred region of allowed values is limited to @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and why this oblong region is slanted in such a way as to couple the higher values of @xmath19 to the smaller values of @xmath18 .",
    "but in the context of @xmath90 , this is precisely the region permitted by the requirement that @xmath72 be equal to 1 , as evidenced by the fact that our theoretical curve passes directly through the middle of the observationally permitted region and , even more impressively , precisely tracks the _ orientation _ of this region .",
    "the point of this is that while the data are not sufficiently precise to tell us the exact value of @xmath18 , the range of allowed values of @xmath19 trends with @xmath18 in such a way as to always preserve the condition @xmath74 .     must have in @xmath3cdm ( or wcdm if @xmath78 ) as a function of @xmath18 , when the condition @xmath70 is imposed",
    "this curve is shown against the constraints ( adapted from figure  4 in melchiorri et al .",
    "2003 ) on the dark - energy equation - of - state , assuming a flat universe .",
    "the type ia sn limits have been updated from the more recent results in suzuki et al .",
    "these limits and confidence levels include results from cmb anisotropies , measurements of the hubble constant , and large - scale structure .",
    "the empirically derived , concordance values of @xmath19 versus @xmath18 track those imposed on @xmath3cdm by the @xmath70 condition exceptionally well .",
    "note , for example , the location ( black dot ) of the wmap measurements @xcite , versus ( star ) the latest measurements by planck @xcite , which resulted in the values @xmath86 and @xmath91 .",
    "the value @xmath85 is realized only when @xmath17 . ]",
    "these results clearly argue against any suggestion that @xmath92 ( or , more specifically , @xmath85 when @xmath17 ) could be a coincidence in @xmath3cdm .",
    "first , not only would it be highly improbable for @xmath18 to have the value required to guarantee @xmath70 which , by the way , could only happen once in the entire history of the universe , and it would have to be happening right now , when we just happen to be looking .",
    "but in addition , the region of @xmath93 phase space permitted by the data shows a clear trend exactly matching the behavior one would expect if @xmath72 must always be equal to 1 . in other words ,",
    "even if @xmath92 were somehow a coincidence , there is no reason why the allowed region of @xmath93 phase space should be slanted from upper left to bottom right , instead of from upper right to bottom left .",
    "it is therefore difficult to argue against the conclusion that @xmath3cdm is merely mimicking the expansion history we would have obtained with @xmath4 all along , and that the observed value of @xmath18 ( which happens to be @xmath75 if @xmath17 ) is required in order to make the assumed density @xmath94 comply with the equation of state @xmath95 found in the @xmath96 universe .",
    "the results we have just presented do not exist in isolation , of course . they add weight to the other one - on - one comparisons between @xmath4 and @xmath3cdm that uniformly show the superiority of the former over the latter in accounting for the data .",
    "but the analysis we have carried out in this paper is important specifically because it starts to probe the fundamental reasons why @xmath3cdm can sometimes function as an approximation to @xmath4 , and why it does reasonably well accounting for some of the data , e.g. , the type ia sne .",
    "for example , even though the empirically motivated choice of density @xmath94 is not entirely consistent with the equation of state @xmath95 , it can nonetheless lead to an expansion history that mimics @xmath4 over a hubble time ",
    "but only so long as @xmath97 .",
    "recently , we studied in detail how the type ia sne ought to be interpreted in the context of @xmath3cdm and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the best - fit distance moduli calculated from these two theories are so close to each other all the way out to @xmath98 , that it is difficult to determine on the basis of a @xmath99 comparison alone which of these two cosmologies is favored . this is due in part to the strong dependence of the data reduction itself on the pre - assumed cosmology , since at least 4 ` nuisance ' parameters defining the sn luminosity must be optimized along with the free parameters of the model .",
    "the inferred sn luminosities and their ` measured ' distance moduli are therefore strongly compliant to the pre - assumed model , greatly weakening this particular comparative test .",
    "indeed , a similar analysis of the most up - do - date gamma - ray burst hubble diagram ( hd ) @xcite reinforces this point by demonstrating that when the data are re - calibrated correctly for each individual cosmology , the @xmath4 universe fits the observed hd better than @xmath3cdm does .",
    "a quick inspection of figure  3 allows us to better appreciate why @xmath3cdm fits the type ia sne and gamma - ray burst data as well as it does .",
    "this figure shows the ratio of luminosity distances @xmath100 as a function of redshift for different values of @xmath18 , in a universe with @xmath17 .",
    "what emerges from this diagram is that the value of @xmath18 that comes closest to satisfying the condition @xmath70 in equation  ( 4 ) , also corresponds to the @xmath3cdm universe in which the luminosity distance @xmath101 most closely tracks its counterpart in @xmath4 .",
    "one should not be surprised therefore , to see that the best fit @xmath3cdm cosmology fits the type ia sne and gamma - ray burst data as well as it does .",
    "cdm over that in @xmath4 , as a function of redshift , for various values of @xmath18 , assuming @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath3cdm cosmology with @xmath85 , which comes closest to satisfying the condition @xmath70 , also best approximates the condition @xmath102 over a large range in @xmath33 . ]",
    "unfortunately , @xmath3cdm does not do as well accounting for the high-@xmath33 universe , having difficulty explaining why the cmb fluctuations show no correlation at angles greater than @xmath103 , and failing to explain how @xmath104 supermassive black holes could have formed so quickly after the big bang .",
    "the issue is that even though the differences between @xmath3cdm and @xmath90 may be smoothed out over a hubble time through the careful choice of @xmath97 , the expansion history of the universe at @xmath105 is so different between these two cosmologies that it is simply not possible to mimic the equation of state @xmath95 with @xmath94 , given that @xmath4 predicts a constant expansion , while @xmath3cdm predicts a very rapid deceleration .",
    "additional inconsistencies between the predicted age - redshift relationship in @xmath3cdm and that observed for the oldest objects in the universe have recently been pointed out by @xcite .    and",
    "lest the reader come away with the sense that @xmath3cdm and @xmath4 overlap so much that one should not worry about their differences , we close this discussion by again pointing out the most profound consequence of their disparity . as shown in @xcite , the horizon problem does not exist in @xmath4 .",
    "so whereas @xmath3cdm could not survive without inflation , the real universe may have done without it , and the cosmological data  particularly at high redshift  may be pointing in that direction .",
