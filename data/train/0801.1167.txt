    "[ sec : intro ]    the infrared spectra of protostars and obscured background stars show prominent absorption features at 3.0 , 4.25 , 4.7 , 6.0 , 6.85 , 9.7 , and 15 @xmath1  along with a suite of weaker features ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see @xcite for a complete list of features ) .",
    "these are attributed to absorption in the vibrational modes of molecules in ices , except for the 9.7 @xmath1  band which is mostly due to silicates . at the low temperatures ( @xmath920 k ) of dense clouds and circum - protostellar environments atoms and molecules",
    "freeze out rapidly on dust grains .",
    "grain surface chemistry efficiently forms new , simple species , such as h@xmath3o and h@xmath3co ( e.g. @xcite ) . complex species ( e.g. polyoxymethylene [ ` pom ' , -(ch@xmath3-o)@xmath10- ] , and hexamethylenetetramine [ hmt , c@xmath11h@xmath12n@xmath13 )",
    "can be formed through the impact of energetic photons or cosmic rays on the ices , as many laboratory studies have shown ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus far , only the simple species h@xmath3o , co , co@xmath3 , ch@xmath14 , ch@xmath4oh , nh@xmath4 and the @xmath15co and @xmath16 isotopes have been positively identified in the ices toward both low and high mass protostars as well as extincted background stars whose lines of sight trace quiescent dense cloud material .",
    "reasonable evidence exists for the presence of hcooh , ocs and the ions nh@xmath8 , ocn@xmath6 , and hcoo@xmath6 as well , although their existence is sometimes debated because of inaccurate fits with laboratory spectra or the lack of multiple bands for independent confirmation .",
    "the identification of the ions in the ices has been particularly controversial .",
    "the first ion claimed was ocn@xmath6 @xcite and was thought to be produced by heavy energetic processing of co : nh@xmath4 ices .",
    "later it was realized that acid - base chemistry in a hnco : nh@xmath4 ice could yield the same products @xcite .",
    "acid - base reactions are very efficient and occur at temperatures as low as 10 k @xcite .",
    "the created ions are less volatile than neutral species and would be able to form an interstellar salt after the other species have sublimated .",
    "the presence of complex species formed by ultraviolet ( uv ) photon and cosmic ray processing of the simple ices is at least as controversial .",
    "many claims were made @xcite , but the observational evidence is not firm .",
    "it is crucial to determine the complexity of the ices in the circumstellar environment of low mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) , as they may be delivered directly to comets and they may ultimately serve as the source of volatiles in planets . at sublimation fronts in the warm inner regions of disks they are the starting point of a complex gas phase chemistry .",
    "the relative abundances of n- , c- , and o - bearing species coming from the ices determine directly the type of chemistry in hot cores ( or ` hot corinos ' for low mass objects ; e.g. @xcite ) .    as a step toward better characterizing the molecular content of icy grain mantles",
    ", this work presents spectra of a large sample of low mass protostars and background stars obtained with the infrared spectrometer ( irs ; @xcite ) at the spitzer space telescope @xcite in the 5 - 35 @xmath1  wavelength range .",
    "these data are complemented with spectra at 2 - 4 @xmath1  obtained with ground - based facilities .",
    "such full coverage over the near and mid - infrared wavelength ranges is essential in determining the composition of the ices ; most species have several vibrational modes and more secure identifications can be made when the features are studied simultaneously .",
    "the identification process is aided by studying large samples of sight - lines facilitating correlation of band strengths and shapes with each other and , if known , with physical characteristics along the sight - lines , such as luminosity and evolutionary stage of any heating source .",
    "the great sensitivity of the irs allows for observations of objects with luminosities that are down by orders of magnitude with respect to what could be observed before in the mid - infrared ( typically 1 l@xmath17 versus @xmath18 l@xmath17 ) .",
    "most data presented in this paper were obtained from spectral surveys of nearby molecular clouds and isolated dense cores in the context of the spitzer legacy program ` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks ' ( ` c2d ' ; @xcite ) .",
    "initial results from this program emphasize the importance of thermal processing in the evolution of the ices , as the ices surrounding the low mass yso hh  46 irs are more processed compared to b5 irs1 @xcite .",
    "ices toward the edge - on disk crbr 2422.8 - 3423 were presented in @xcite and also show signs of heating .",
    "finally , mid - infrared spectra of ices toward background stars tracing quiescent cloud material were published in @xcite , showing for the first time that the ( unknown ) carrier of the 6.85 @xmath1  absorption band is abundant even at the coldest conditions away from star formation .",
    "this paper specifically addresses questions on the identification of the 6.0 and 6.85 @xmath1  bands .",
    "these prominent absorption features are still not fully identified , despite being detected nearly 30 years ago with the kuiper airborne observatory @xcite and commonly observed toward massive ysos with the infrared space observatory ( iso ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the peak position of the 6.85 @xmath1  band varies dramatically , and is thought to be a function of the ice temperature @xcite .",
    "either one carrier with a pronounced temperature dependence of its absorption bands , or two independent carriers , one much more volatile than the other , must be responsible for the 6.85 @xmath1  feature .",
    "if the former is the case , the ammonium ion ( nh@xmath8 ) is considered a promising candidate @xcite .",
    "the 6.0 @xmath1  band was initially thought to be mainly due to the bending mode of h@xmath3o ( @xcite ; however , see @xcite ) , but analysis of iso spectra indicated that this is not the case toward several massive ysos @xcite .",
    "the depth of the 6.0 @xmath1band is in some cases significantly ( factor of 2 ) deeper than that expected from the 3.0 @xmath1  h@xmath3o stretching mode .",
    "part of this ` excess ' might be due to a strong vibration of the hcooh molecule .",
    "recent observations of background stars show a small excess ( @xmath1925% ) , of which half could be due to the enhanced band strength of the h@xmath3o bending mode in co@xmath3-rich ices @xcite .",
    "finally , it was claimed that much of the 6.0 @xmath1  excess and part of the 6.85 @xmath1  band is due to highly processed ices , i.e. a mixture of complex species with c  h and o ",
    "h bonds produced after irradiation of simple ices @xcite . in this case , one would expect the 6.0 @xmath1  excess to be enhanced in high radiation environments , such as near more evolved protostars .",
    "thus , fundamental questions remain on the identification of the 6.0 and 6.85 @xmath1  bands , and with the large sample presented in this work the possible answers can be further constrained .",
    "subsequent papers will specifically address the co@xmath3 @xcite , ch@xmath14 @xcite , and nh@xmath4 ( s. bottinelli et al .",
    ", in preparation ) species .",
    "further papers in this series will investigate the ices toward background stars behind large clouds ( c. knez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and isolated cores ( a. c. a. boogert et al . , in preparation ) .",

    "this could be explained by the formation of a new species as the ices are heated and sublimate or it could be a pre - existing species that is less volatile than h@xmath3o whose absorption band ( c4 ) prevails at lower h@xmath3o abundances . in the first scenario heating must play a role , and in the second it may .",
    "the detection of the c4 component in all ysos and toward background stars favors the second scenario , in which the carrier is not formed by heating for its carrier exists already in the earliest stages of chemical evolution , i.e. in quiescent clouds .",
    "higher dust temperatures in the vicinity of ysos lead to sublimation and lower h@xmath3o and co abundances ( fig .",
    "[ f : corr685 ] ) and the abundance of the carrier of the c3 component is reduced more rapidly than that of the c4 component .    does the carrier of the c4 component survive in the diffuse interstellar medium ?",
    "a band at 6.85 @xmath1  is detected in lines of sight toward the galactic center ( gc ) , tracing a large column of diffuse dust @xcite .",
    "however , its depth relative to the 9.7 @xmath1  silicate band ( @xmath80 ) is a factor of 5 less compared to the c4 component in the ysos ( factor of 10 compared to c3 ) .",
    "the weak 6.85 @xmath1  band observed toward the gc sources is attributed to the c - h asymmetric deformation mode of aliphatic hydrocarbons @xcite .",
    "such aliphatic hydrocarbons have strong c - h stretching modes with distinct peaks at 3.38 , 3.42 , and 3.48 @xmath1 . a band at 3.47 @xmath1  is commonly detected toward ysos @xcite , but it does not show these distinct peaks and its depth relative to the 6.85 @xmath1  band is a factor of 3 weaker compared to the gc sources .",
    "thus , although the carrier of the c4 component observed in our sample is ( probably ) less volatile than ices , it does not survive in the diffuse ism .",
    "conversely , the hydrocarbons observed in the diffuse ism are not the carrier of the c4 component toward ysos .    in a scenario proposed by @xcite",
    "both the c3 and c4 components arise from an nh@xmath8-containing ice .",
    "its abundance would be typically 7% with respect to h@xmath3o ( table  [ t : colden ] and fig .",
    "[ f : abun ] ) , assuming the integrated band strength of @xmath81 cm / molecule measured in @xcite .",
    "nh@xmath8 ions can be produced either by acid - base reactions at low temperature ( e.g. from nh@xmath4:hnco at 10 k ; @xcite ) or by ultraviolet or cosmic ray irradiation of simple mixtures ( e.g. h@xmath3o : co@xmath3:nh@xmath4:o@xmath3 ) .",
    "the nh@xmath8 band that is produced shifts to longer wavelengths upon heating , i.e. from the peak wavelength of the c3 component to the peak wavelength of the c4 component .",
    "after additional energetic processing and h@xmath3o sublimation a salt is formed .",
    "salts do not sublimate until temperatures of @xmath5200 k ( e.g. @xcite ) , significantly higher than the h@xmath3o sublimation temperature of 90 k in space .",
    "the processed laboratory spectra show absorption at 6.0 @xmath1  due to anions ( no@xmath82 , no@xmath83 , and hco@xmath83 ) , some of which overlaps with the c2 components centered at @xmath56.15 @xmath1  that are observed in the ysos with strong c4 components ( fig .  [",
    "f : resid ] ;  [ sec : disc2 ] ) . while these properties are consistent with the observations of ysos , the presence of the c4 component toward all ysos and background stars is hard to explain .",
    "in the experiments of @xcite an nh@xmath8 temperature of almost 200 k is required to match the peak position of this component .",
    "such a high temperature can be excluded for many sources in the sample .",
    "perhaps the impact of cosmic rays is responsible for the shift in peak position .",
    "subsequent heating by nearby protostars leads to the observed increase in the c4/c3 ratio and eventually to the formation of a salt .",
    "[ sec : disc5 ]    the enigmatic c5 component that stretches from 5.8 to @xmath58.0 @xmath1is not due to nh@xmath4 , h@xmath3co , hcooh , hcoo@xmath6 , or ch@xmath4oh , because these species do contribute to components c1-c4 (  [ sec : carr ] ) . also , no correlation is found between the strengths of the c5 and the 6.85 @xmath1  red ( c4 ) components .",
    "therefore , these have unrelated origins .",
    "heating might be involved in the formation of the carrier(s ) of the c5 component ( fig .",
    "[ f : corrc5 ] ;  [ sec : corr ] ) .",
    "previously , three different origins were considered in the literature .",
    "first , it should be noted that the shape of the average c5 component resembles that of the spectrum of solid h@xmath3o ( fig .",
    "[ f : compex ] ) .",
    "it is particularly reminiscent of heated h@xmath3o ( @xmath84 k ) , because of the weakness of the 6.0 @xmath1  peak with respect to the long wavelength wing ( e.g. @xcite ) . while the shape of the 3 @xmath1  band indicates that heated ices are present along several lines of sight ( e.g. , rno 91 ) , its depth is , by the very definition of the c5 component , insufficient .",
    "possibly , due to the effects of light scattering at the shorter wavelengths , a more direct path to the warm inner regions of the yso is observed at 6 @xmath1  compared to 3 @xmath1 .",
    "monte carlo radiative transfer models of a circumstellar disk show that at inclination angles of @xmath85 the depth of the 6.0 @xmath1  h@xmath3o band is enhanced by a factor of 10 with respect to that at 3.0 @xmath1  @xcite . at higher inclinations ,",
    "the enhancement is a factor of 34 , while at lower inclinations the effect is negligible .",
    "thus , the c5 component may be attributed to heated h@xmath3o ice for some sources in our sample ; for example , rno 91 is known to possess an inclined disk @xcite and has one of the most prominent c5 components . at the other extreme ,",
    "the weakest c5 components are observed toward background stars ( table  [ t : tau ] ) .",
    "indeed , in these lines of sight the effect of scattering on the relative h@xmath3o band depths is expected to be small due to the uniformity of the foreground clouds . for many ysos with c5 absorption",
    ", however , independent observational evidence indicates that the scattering scenario is unlikely .",
    "for example , the ch@xmath4oh column density derived from the 3.53 @xmath1  c  h stretching mode agrees well with that derived from the 9.7 @xmath1  c  h bending mode (  [ sec : ch3oh ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "also , for high mass ysos the 4.25 and 15 @xmath1  bands provided solid co@xmath3 column densities that were in excellent agreement with each other @xcite , and in one line of sight also with the 2.7 @xmath1  co@xmath3 combination mode @xcite .",
    "thus , for these ysos other explanations are required .",
    "a second explanation of the c5 component could be the blend of negative ions suggested in @xcite .",
    "ammonium ( nh@xmath8 ) and the anions hco@xmath83 , no@xmath83 , and no@xmath82 are produced after uv photolysis or cosmic ray bombardment of h@xmath3o / co@xmath3/nh@xmath4/o@xmath3 ice mixtures .",
    "nh@xmath8 has a strong band at 6.85 @xmath1  ( i.e. components c3 and c4 in this work ) , but the bands of the anions overlap such that only one very broad feature is observed in the 5 - 8 @xmath1range . while one may expect that in this scenario the c3/c4 and c5 components correlate well with each other , the observations show they do not .",
    "notably , the background stars have strong 6.85 @xmath1components and little c5 absorption . the nh@xmath8 ion can be produced after warming up a simple ice mixture too , however , while the hco@xmath83 , no@xmath83 , no@xmath82 anions may need more energetic input @xcite .",
    "this may explain the large variation in the strength of the c5 component .",
    "third , extensive processing of simple ices by uv light or cosmic rays produces an organic refractory residue @xcite , whose blended o - h and c - h stretching and bending modes produce a feature similar to the c5 component @xcite . both this scenario and the blend of ions discussed above require a correlation of the strength of the c5 component with independent indicators of the presence of strong uv or cosmic ray fluxes , which are currently unavailable .",
    "also , both the organic residue and the salts are less volatile than the ices  they sublimate at temperatures @xmath19500 k in the laboratory ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xmath86=180 k for h@xmath3o ice ) .",
    "therefore , one may expect c5 to be the main absorption component in the 58 @xmath1  region toward some ysos where all h@xmath3o ices have evaporated .",
    "although in several sources the c5 component is the dominant contributor , it always is observed together with h@xmath3o ( except possibly toward l1448 irs1 ) .",
    "some h@xmath3o may be trapped in the salt or organic residue at high temperatures , and some may be present in unprocessed foreground material .",
    "it is also important to note that , similar to c4 (  [ sec : disc3c4 ] ) , the c5 component is not observed in the diffuse ism , confirming that their carrier(s ) are not as refractory as silicates ( @xmath871500 k ) .",
    "finally it is noted that the c5 component may have a different origin in different lines of sight .",
    "an in - depth analysis of the physical conditions in specific lines of sight is required to discriminate between the effects of disk orientation and the various ice processing mechanisms .",
    "[ sec : disc2 ]    the c2 component spans the 6.0 - 6.4 @xmath1  wavelength range and is likely due to at least three different carriers .",
    "the n - h bending mode of nh@xmath4 at 6.15 @xmath1  contributes 10 - 50% to this band (  [ sec : nh3 ] ) .",
    "another likely contributor is h@xmath3o .",
    "although the spectrum of pure , amorphous h@xmath3o was subtracted from the 5 - 8 @xmath1region before determining the various component strengths and profiles , the spectrum of interstellar h@xmath3o may deviate from that of a pure , amorphous h@xmath3o ice .",
    "the o - h bending mode of h@xmath3o shifts to longer wavelengths , becomes significantly narrower , and its peak strength increases if the hydrogen bonding network in bulk amorphous h@xmath3o ice is broken by the presence of other species @xcite .",
    "co@xmath3 is a realistic species , because it is abundant ( 15 - 40% with respect to h@xmath3o ) and a significant fraction is known to be mixed with h@xmath3o @xcite . at sufficiently high co@xmath3 concentrations , the h@xmath3o is located in small clusters , leading to monomer , dimer , and multimer bondings that produce a strong peak at 6.12 @xmath1 .",
    "the optical depth of the peak has been calculated for the yso b5 irs1 @xcite and the background star elias 16 @xcite assuming the h@xmath3o ice along these lines of sight consists of two components : pure h@xmath3o and the mixture h@xmath3o : co@xmath3=2:1 .",
    "it was found that when 25% of the h@xmath3o is present in the latter , the 3 and 6 @xmath1  bands of h@xmath3o and the 15 @xmath1  band of co@xmath3 are fitted simultaneously .",
    "comparison with the c2 component in these sources shows that 20 - 50% could be due to this effect .",
    "thus the short wavelength side of the c2 component is both due to h@xmath3o : co@xmath3 mixtures and due to nh@xmath4 . for the long - wavelength side ,",
    "the c = o stretching mode of the hcoo@xmath6 anion was previously considered , contributing @xmath1920% to the c2 strength (  [ sec : hcoom ] ) .",
    "other anions , such as no@xmath82 , no@xmath83 , and hco@xmath83 (  [ sec : disc3c4 ] ) , may contribute as well .",
    "these particular anions may be produced in the energetic processing of simple ices @xcite , along with nh@xmath8 .",
    "indeed , one of the most interesting observational aspects of the c2 component is that it becomes more pronounced for sources with stronger c4 components and lower h@xmath3o abundances ( figs .",
    "[ f : resid ] and  [ f : compcorrel ] ) .",
    "overall the two components do not correlate very well , however , which is consistent with the result that three carriers of different nature contribute to the c2 component .",
    "[ sec : dischem ]    ch@xmath4oh shows larger abundance variations with respect to h@xmath3o than other solid state species discussed in this work ( hcooh , h@xmath3co , nh@xmath4 ) .",
    "tight 3@xmath56 upper limits of a few % are reported for a number of ysos , but detections above the 10% level for others ( table  [ t : colden ] and fig .",
    "[ f : abun ] ) .",
    "the solid hcooh abundance is typically a factor of 2 - 3 lower than ch@xmath4oh and does not show such large variations .",
    "if both ch@xmath4oh and hcooh are formed from co by grain surface reactions , the lower hcooh abundances are understood by the low atomic o / h ratio in the accreted gas , and by the competition for o to react to co@xmath3 rather than with the formyl radical ( hco ) to form hcooh @xcite .",
    "indeed , large solid co@xmath3 abundances ( 15 - 40% with respect to h@xmath3o ) are observed for a wide variety of ysos @xcite .",
    "grain surface chemistry does indeed appear a more likely formation mechanism than uv processing of the ices .",
    "first , while processing of simple ices by uv photons leads to ch@xmath4oh formation , this process is not efficient enough to explain the enhanced abundances toward massive ysos @xcite , while for low mass ysos the uv flux is likely too low regardless .",
    "second , hcooh and ch@xmath4oh are detected even in the most obscured sight - lines in the sample .",
    "in fact , enhanced ch@xmath4oh abundances are detected exclusively in some of the most embedded ysos : the low mass ysos svs 4 - 5 , b1-b , and iras 15398 - 3359 and the massive ysos w33a and gl7009s @xcite .",
    "svs 4 - 5 is known to trace the envelope of the foreground class 0 object smm4 @xcite . on the other hand , toward a few background stars tracing quiescent cloud material a low upper limit to the ch@xmath4oh abundance was determined ( table  [ t : colden ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus it is suggested that , in the grain surface chemistry scenario , the ch@xmath4oh abundance is enhanced at a time during the collapse ( of some clouds ) when the atomic o needed to form h@xmath3o and co@xmath3 is exhausted , while still sufficient co and h are available to form ch@xmath4oh @xcite .    while grain surface chemistry likely forms the simple neutral species ,",
    "different mechanisms are required to produce the ions possibly responsible for several of the components in the 5 - 8 @xmath1  range .",
    "if the observed c3 and c4 components are indeed due to nh@xmath8 , its abundance is typically 7% with respect to h@xmath3o ( fig .",
    "[ f : abun ] ) .",
    "the c4 component is observed even in the coldest sight - lines .",
    "indeed , low temperature acid - base chemistry can efficiently produce nh@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the abundance of negative counter ions needs to be addressed . while the c5 component could hide the necessary negative ions @xcite ,",
    "its strength does not correlate with the c3/c4 components .",
    "further investigations on the presence of ions in the ices are crucial to understand the ice chemistry .",
    "their physical properties are different from neutral species .",
    "ions have higher sublimation temperatures , and thus the salts that are formed after the volatile species ( e.g. h@xmath3o and co@xmath3 ) have sublimated are able to survive at lower extinctions , and then are subjected to harsher conditions , forming more complex species .",
    "for example , the biologically interesting species urea ( h@xmath3nconh@xmath3 ) is formed after the uv irradiation of a nh@xmath8ocn@xmath6 salt @xcite .",
    "[ sec : concl ]    the present work extends the study of ices over the full 3 - 20 @xmath1wavelength range from the previously well studied massive ysos ( @xmath88l@xmath17 ) to low mass ysos ( @xmath51l@xmath17 ) .",
    "the following new insights were obtained :    * absorption features are detected at 6.0 and 6.85 @xmath1  in all sources , including high- and low - mass ysos and background stars tracing quiescent cloud material .",
    "an empirical decomposition shows that the 5 - 7 @xmath1  absorption complex consists , in addition to the h@xmath3o bending mode , of a combination of at least 5 independent absorption components . * in a subset of sources additional weak features are detected at 7.25 , 7.40 , and at 9.0 and 9.7 @xmath1  on top of the prominent si - o stretching band of silicates .",
    "these features are associated with ch@xmath4oh , hcooh , nh@xmath4 , and possibly hcoo@xmath6 and indicate abundances of 1 - 30% , 1 - 5% , 3 - 8% , and 0.3% with respect to h@xmath3o , respectively .",
    "the large source - to - source solid ch@xmath4oh abundance variations are likely a result of the conditions at the time of grain surface chemistry . *",
    "component c1 ( 5.7 - 6.0 @xmath1 ) is mostly explained by solid hcooh and h@xmath3co at abundances with respect to solid h@xmath3o of typically 1 - 5% and @xmath56% , respectively .",
    "* component c2 ( 6.0 - 6.4 @xmath1 ) also likely arises from a blend of several species .",
    "solid nh@xmath4 can account for 10 - 50% of the absorption .",
    "a similar amount can be attributed to absorption by monomers , dimers , and small multimers of h@xmath3o mixed with a substantial amount of co@xmath3 .",
    "the long - wavelength side of c2 is potentially due to anions produced by acid - base chemistry ( e.g. hcoo@xmath6 ) or energetic processing .",
    "indeed , a weak correlation with c4 suggests the carriers of these bands ( possibly salts ) are related . * components c3 and c4 , the 6.85 @xmath1  band ,",
    "show the same characteristics for low mass ysos and background stars as was previously found for massive ysos by @xcite .",
    "their ratio is empirically found to be dependent on dust temperature .",
    "the carrier of c4 is likely less volatile than that of c3 and than h@xmath3o , but it is not observed in the diffuse ism .",
    "these characteristics are also consistent with both components being due to nh@xmath8 ( ammonium ion ) .",
    "the detection of strong 6.85 @xmath1  bands toward deeply embedded ysos and background stars requires a production at low temperature ( acid - base chemistry or processing by cosmic rays ) , given the lack of heating sources and stellar uv fields .",
    "* the origin of the very broad component c5 ( 5 - 8 @xmath1 ) is least understood .",
    "it is quite strong in several low and high mass ysos , absent in others and so far undetected toward background stars .",
    "it is possibly related to thermal processing , as a weak correlation with the ratio of the polar / apolar co components is observed and its shape resembles that of warm h@xmath3o .",
    "a blend of absorption by ions , as proposed by @xcite , which would require both heating and energetic processing of the ices , can not be excluded .",
