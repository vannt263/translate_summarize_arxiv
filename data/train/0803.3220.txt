    "even after two decades of intensive research , the physics of the high temperature cuprate superconductors is as elusive as ever @xcite .",
    "the principal mystery surrounds the underdoped regime , which evinces a well - formed quasiparticle gap even at temperatures well above the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath1 .",
    "the recent observation of a non - zero polar kerr effect ( pke ) in the underdoped ybco @xcite , which demonstrates macroscopic time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry breaking in the pseudogap phase , is a step forward in solving the pseudogap puzzle .",
    "the pke appears roughly at the same temperature , @xmath2 , where the pseudogap develops @xcite .",
    "near optimum doping , the pke appears at a temperature _ below _",
    "@xmath1 , consistent with the existence of a zero temperature quantum phase transition under the superconducting dome .",
    "this observation suggests that the tr symmetry breaking and the pseudogap in the cuprates may have the same physical origin , which is also unrelated to the @xmath0-wave superconductivity itself .",
    "similar conclusion was also reached eariler by muon spin rotation experiments @xcite . in this work",
    "we predict the existence of an anomalous nernst effect associated with the tr symmetry breaking which should be present along with the observed pke in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "our results demonstrate that the existence of anomalous nernst effect at temperatures as high as the pseudogap temperatures ( see below ) , where the vortex excitations of the superconductor are unlikely to be present , may imply an ordered state with broken tr symmetry in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "it was proposed earlier @xcite that the @xmath3 density - wave ( ddw ) state may be responsible for the pseudogap behavior in the underdoped cuprates . in real space , the order parameter for this state consists of orbital currents along the bonds of the two dimensional square lattice of copper atoms . since the currents circulate in opposite directions in any two consecutive unit cells of the lattice , the total orbital current averages to zero , and the macroscopic tr symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "recently , it was shown that the admixture of a small @xmath4 component to the order parameter of the ddw state breaks the global tr symmetry , producing a non - zero kerr signal @xcite in conformity with the experiments @xcite .",
    "the chiral @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) density - wave state , as also the regular ddw and the spin density wave state , has hole and electron pockets as fermi surfaces in its excitation spectra .",
    "such reconstructed small fermi pockets are consistent with the recently observed quantum oscillation in high magnetic fields in underdoped ybco @xcite . in this paper , we discuss an intrinsic anomalous nernst effect induced by the @xmath7 density - wave state as a direct consequence of the macroscopic tr symmetry breaking and the presence of the fermi pockets . because of the broken tr symmetry , the ordered state acquires a berry curvature @xcite which is sizable on the fermi surfaces .",
    "it is known that the non - zero berry curvature can produce the anomalous hall @xcite and nernst lee2,xiao effects in ferromagnets .",
    "we focus here on the anomalous nernst effect for the high-@xmath1 cuprates , because the corresponding coefficient has been extensively measured @xcite .",
    "nernst signal for unconventional density waves , such as the ddw state , was studied earlier in ref .  [ ] and references therein . in these papers , however , the order parameter of the bare ddw state was used , for which the nernst effect was induced by the external magnetic field . on the other hand , in the present paper we consider the superposition of two different @xmath0-wave order parameters ( motivated by the pke measurements xia1 , tewari ) , and the spontaneous breakdown of time reversal symmetry leads to the berry curvature , which acts as a magnetic field . estimating the degree of tr symmetry breaking from the pke measurements of ref .",
    "xia1 , we calculate the expected anomalous nernst signal in the underdoped phase of ybco near @xmath2 .",
    "we stress that even though we model the pseudogap by a chiral ddw state , the basic conclusions are more robust ; the broken tr symmetry and well - defined fermi surfaces , both of which have now been experimentally verified , necessarily imply the anomalous nernst effect which should be observable .",
    "note that , recent neutron scattering experiments mock , fauque have appeared to indicate a tr breaking state without translational symmetry breaking in the pseudogap regime @xcite .",
    "we expect an anomalous nernst effect for such a state as well , if it breaks the tr symmetry globally .",
    "the order parameter of the @xmath5 density wave state nayak is a combination of two density waves with different angular patterns @xmath8where @xmath9 are the electron creation and annihilation operators on the 2d square lattice of copper atoms , @xmath10 is a 2d momentum , @xmath11 is the momentum space modulation vector @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the spin indices . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the order parameter amplitudes of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 density wave components , respectively .",
    "the imaginary part , @xmath17 , of the order parameter breaks the microscopic tr symmetry giving rise to spontaneous currents along the nearest neighbor bonds of the square lattice .",
    "the spontaneous currents produce a staggered magnetic flux , which averages to zero on the macroscopic scale .",
    "the @xmath4 component of the density wave , @xmath18 , leads to the staggered modulation of the diagonal electron tunneling between the next - nearest neighbor lattice sites .",
    "such staggered modulation breaks the symmetry between the plaquettes with positive and negative circulation and , thus , breaks the macroscopic tr symmetry .",
    "such macroscopic tr symmetry breaking may account for the nonzero pke observed in the recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the hartree - fock hamiltonian appropriate for the mean - field @xmath7 density wave is given by @xmath19where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the free electron band structure , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the chemical potential .",
    "the order parameter has been rewritten as @xmath24 with the amplitude @xmath25 and the phase @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the step function . in writing the hamiltonian ,",
    "the first brillouin zone has been folded to the magnetic or reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) to treat the @xmath28 modulation effectively .",

    "the relevant parameter space is the space of the crystal momentum @xmath10 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian are therefore @xmath10-dependent , and the overlap of two wavefunctions infinitesimally separated in the @xmath10-space defines the berry phase connection @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the periodic amplitude of the block wave function , and @xmath41 is the band index .",
    "the berry phase connection corresponds to an effective vector potential in the momentum space , and its line integration around a close path gives the berry phase .",
    "the berry curvature , the berry phase per unit area in the @xmath10 space , is given by @xmath42the berry curvature @xmath43 , thus , acts as an effective magnetic field in the momentum space and enters in the equations of motion of the wavepacket .",
    "for a system invariant under both time reversal and spatial inversion symmetries , the berry curvature @xmath44 for every @xmath10 . however , the @xmath7 density - wave state breaks the macroscopic tr symmetry , therefore the berry curvature can acquire non - zero values .    to calculate the non - zero berry curvature , we find the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , which are given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 correspond to the upper and lower bands with the energy dispersion @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the eigenstates",
