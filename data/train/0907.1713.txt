    "the concept of geometric phase ( gp ) was first introduced by panchartnam in his study of interference of classical light in distinct states of polarization @xcite .",
    "berry s work showed a quantum pure state can retain the information of its motion when it undergoes a cyclic evolution @xcite .",
    "simon @xcite subsequently recasted the mathematical formation of berry phase with the language of differential geometry and fibre bundles .",
    "he observed that the origin of berry phase is attributed to the holonomy in the parameter space .",
    "due to its robustness to imperfections , such as docoherence and the random unitary perturbations , geometric phase has many applications in the field of quantum information processing and condensed matter physics .",
    "it has been pointed out that the non - abelian holonomy may be used in the construction of universal sets of quantum gates for the purpose of achieving fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite . on the other hand , gp",
    ", being a measure of the curvature of the hilbert space , when associated with the energy crossing has a peculiar behavior near the degeneracy point .",
    "gp may be considered as a good candidate for a universal order parameter for quantum phase transitions @xcite .    in the early discussions",
    ", most researches were focused on the evolution of pure states . in realistic world , due to the effect of environment , the most states are mixed .",
    "uhlmann was probably the first to address the issue of mixed state holonomy , but as a purely mathematical problem @xcite .",
    "later sjqvist _ et al .",
    "_ discussed the geometric phase for non - degenerate mixed state under unitary evolution in ref.@xcite , basing on the mach - zender interferometer .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite gave a kinematic description of the mixed - state gp in ref.@xcite and extended it to degenerate density operators .",
    "the generalization to nonunitary evolution has also been adressed in refs.@xcite .",
    "later it was found that the above diagonal gp itself could not exhaust al information contained in phases acquired when the quantal system undergoes an adiabatic evolution .",
    "the notions of gp break down in cases where the inteference visibility between the initial and final states vanishes .",
    "this gives rise to the definition of the off - diagonal geometric phase factor @xcite .",
    "here , the concept of berry phase was extended to the the evolution of more than one state .",
    "they found a set of independent off - diagonal phase factors that exhaust the geometrical phase information carried by the basis of eigenstates along the path .",
    "later , the concept of off - diagonal gp was extended to the cases of mixed states@xcite .",

    "the off - diagonal mixed - state geometric phases contain information about the geometry of state space along the path connecting pairs of density operators , when the standard mixed - state geometric phases are undefined .",
    "the uncontained information can be shown via high - order off - diagonal geometric phase .",
    "the @xmath24 case has been discussed in terms of two - particle interferometry @xcite .    the off - diagonal geometric phase for some models has been discussed .",
    "for example , x.x .",
    "_ _ et al.__@xcite investigated the effect of the intersubsystem coupling on the off - diagonal geometric phase in a composite system , where the system undergoes an adiabatic evolution .",
    "in this paper , the thermal state of the hydrogen atom is discussed .",
    "as one knows , in the hydrogen atom , the electron spin is coupled to the nuclear spin by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the hyperfine line for the hydrogen atom has a measured magnitude of 1420 mhz in frequency .",
    "some calculation on the basis of first - order perturbation for the magnetic dipole interaction between the electron and nucleus gives contribution to the coupling strength of @xmath25 term .",
    "taking account of the effect of an external magnetic field , one can have a model hamiltonian which is @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coupling constant . here",
    "the electronic orbital angular momentum @xmath28 is assumed to be zero .",
    "as we know , for a hydrogen atom , the nucleus and electron has both spin-1/2 , @xmath29 .",
    "the hamiltonian eq.[h0 ] has @xmath1 district eigen - energies : @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the former is 3-fold degenerate with eigenvestors : @xmath32 and the latter is non - degenerate with eigenvector @xmath33 .",

    "the system is highly mixed . at the initial time @xmath39 , no magnetic field",

    "the @xmath53 factor of the electron may be put equal to 2 .",

    "assuming after a period @xmath38 , the state evolves to its initial state @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 , then one has @xmath60 here we restrict ourselves to @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath62 which is the function of magnetic field @xmath63 , so one can see the magnetic field @xmath63 and coupling constant @xmath27 can control the period @xmath38 .",
    "after a period evolution , a mixed - state geometric phase can be observed . in next section",
    ", we will discuss this mixed - state geometric phase .",
    "it is obvious that the initial mixed state @xmath64 is degenerate . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a.t . rezakhani and p. zanardi studied the gp of an open quantum system interaction with a thermal environment by using the definition given in ref.@xcite . in sect.[sect : introduction ] , the shortcoming of the definition has been discussed . to overcome the shortcoming",
    ", we will use the definition of off - diagonal gp given by eq.[off - phase ] to evaluate the gp of the state to study the information which are not exhausted by diagonal gp .",
    "the @xmath0-order off - diagonal gp is equivalent to the ordinary diagonal gp which is thought not to exhaust the information about the geometry of state along the path connecting pairs of density operators .",
    "the initial density matrix @xmath65 can be written as @xmath66 there are two eigenspaces .",
    "the first space is @xmath67-dimensional and the second one is @xmath0-dimensional . from eq.[off - phase ] , the @xmath0-order off - diagonal gp can be reduced to @xmath68 where @xmath5 is the unitary operator .",

    "fig.[1order : c ] shows the relation between gp and the external magnetic field @xmath71 .",

    "when increasing of the length of magnetic field tends to enhance gp .",
    "so that one can control gp via manipulating the magnetic field . from the figure , one can see that for a relatively large temperature interval geometric phase is varying very slowly with temperature .",
    "when @xmath72 , the geometric phase vanishes .",
    "it is trivial because in this case no magnetic field is imposed so that the state will not evolve with the time .",
    "when the temperature approaches infinity , i.e. , @xmath73 approaches zero , the matrix @xmath74 will become an identity matrix , so that the unitary matrix @xmath75 will be commutative with the initial state and the state will not evolve with the time . there is no gp can be detected .",

    "also one can see increasing temperature tends to suppress the 2-order off - diagonal gp .",
    "one can test the existence of off - diagonal geometric phase of the above model . if one would detect such a phase the system should be at low temperature , due to rapid decay of geometric phase with temperature .",
    "one can evaluate the mixedness of the state .",
    "the mixedness is defined as @xmath77 . according to @xmath78 , one",
    "can easily obtain the mixedness of the state @xmath79 as @xmath80=\\frac{6 ( 1+e^{\\frac{j}{k t}})}{(3+e^{\\frac{j}{k     t}})^2}.\\ ] ] from eq.[mixedness ] , one can see when the temperature increasing , the mixedness is increased .",
    "when the temperature approaches infinity , the mixedness approaches @xmath81 .",
    "note the mixedness is not varied with the time , but it is the function of temperature . with the increasing temperature of environment ,",
    "the thermal fluctuation of the system is enhanced and the coupling of the system and environment thermal bath is also enhanced .",
    "the enhanced thermal fluctuations suppress the gp of the system .",
    "we have demonstrated the effect of temperature upon the off - diagonal geometric phase .",
    "it shows that increasing temperature tends to suppress the off - diagonal gp . comparing ordinary diagonal gp ,",
    "off - diagonal gp can reveal more information which is not exhausted by standard diagonal gp . as the temperature is increased , the thermal fluctuation will dominate the behavior of the particles and it will suppress the gp .",
