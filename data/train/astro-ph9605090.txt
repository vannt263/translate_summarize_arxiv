    "the supersoft x - ray sources ( sss ) are a class of luminous ( @xmath6 ) objects , with a characteristic radiation temperature of @xmath7k .",
    "seven such sources are now known in the galaxy , 11 in the magellanic clouds , 15 in m31 and candidates exist also in m101 , ngc  253 and m33 ( see reviews by hasinger 1994 ; kahabka & trmper 1996 ; cowley 1996 ) .",
    "the most popular theoretical model for the sss consists of a binary system in which a white dwarf accretes mass from a subgiant companion at such a high rate that it burns hydrogen steadily at its surface ( van den heuvel 1992 ; rappaport 1994 ) .",
    "the difference between sss and ordinary cataclysmic variables is in the high accretion rates ( by a factor @xmath8 ) in the sss .",
    "more recently , yungelson ( 1995 ) have shown that three major binary subpopulations may contribute to the galactic population of sss with : ( i )  low mass main sequence donors , ( ii )  low mass subgiant donors , and ( iii )  ( super)giant donors .",
    "the transient supersoft source rx  j0513.96951 ( hereafter 051369 ) was discovered in outburst during the rosat all sky survey ( schaeidt , hasinger & trmper 1993 ) . in 1990 october",
    "/ november the source brightened in x - rays by about a factor of 20 during a period of @xmath9 days .",
    "a formal black body fit to the pspc data gave a temperature of about 40ev and a bolometric luminosity of @xmath10 , for a column density of n@xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "the source has been monitored roughly every three months between november 1992 and october 1993 and was found to be three times in an off - state and once , on 20/22 july 1993 , in an on - state , with a similar brightness to that observed in the first outburst ( schaeidt 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , a series of weekly hri pointings between 3  november 1994 and 3  march 1995 revealed a third x - ray outburst around the end of december 1994 .",
    "a typical turn - on time of @xmath13  d ( from survey data ) and turn - off time of @xmath14 week ( from the hri pointings ) were thus proposed for this source by schaeidt ( 1996 ) .",
    "this object has been identified with a @xmath15  mag emission - line star in the lmc ( pakull 1993 ; cowley 1993 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations by crampton ( 1996 ) , hereafter c96 , showed that the spectrum is dominated by he  ii emission lines and h@xmath16heii blends .",
    "their radial velocity measurements suggested a binary period of 0.76  d , but no orbital photometric variations were found .",
    "however , we have recently published a @xmath17  year light curve of 051369 , from observations made during the macho project ( alcock 1996 ) .",
    "this photometry revealed a high level of optical variability , including recurrent low states , in which the brightness drops by @xmath18  mag every @xmath19  days .",
    "the extended time - base over which these observations were made enabled us to detect an orbital modulation , although of small semi - amplitude ( @xmath20  mag ) .",
    "the photometric period thus derived , p@xmath1  d , is consistent with the independent spectroscopic result .    in the current work",
    ", we present further spectroscopic and photometric observations of 051369 , in which we see some unusual features , including evidence for high velocity outflows and optical variability on timescales as short as @xmath21  h. we then use all the available optical and x - ray data in an attempt to construct a comprehensive theoretical model for the source .",
    "the spectroscopic observations are described in   2 , and the photometry in   3 . in   4 , we present a refined spectroscopic period , and consider the implications of the derived binary parameters and mass function . a discussion and the proposed model follow .",
    "we obtained intermediate resolution spectra of 051369 on the nights 29/11/94  1/12/94 using the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope at siding spring , australia .",
    "the detector was a tek ccd attached to the rgo spectrograph , using a 1200v grating .",
    "the wavelength coverage is 43675070  in the blue and 61036857  in the red , with a resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "due to variable cloud and generally poor seeing , no standard stars were observed , hence the spectra are not flux calibrated .",
    "cu - ar arc spectra were taken at regular intervals for calibration of the wavelength scale in the reduction procedure .",
    "a series of tungsten flat fields and bias frames were also obtained . tab .",
    "1 lists the journal of observations .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the starlink figaro package and pamela routines of k.horne .",
    "removal of the bias signal was achieved through subtraction of the mean overscan level on each frame .",
    "this was acceptable since an examination of the bias frames showed no significant structure .",
    "small scale pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations were removed by multiplying by a balance frame prepared from flat fields of a tungsten lamp .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted using the optimal algorithm of horne ( 1986 ) , and calibration of the wavelength scale was achieved using the molly package of t.r .",

    "we present below the spectroscopic data and give a description of the principal features .",
    "a detailed radial velocity analysis is given later in ",
    "we show in fig .  1 the variance - weighted average of all our blue spectra .",
    "heii and h@xmath2 are seen strongly in emission , with narrow cores and broad bases .",
    "previous spectroscopic observations ( pakull 1993 ; c96 ) have shown the presence of highly ionised elements , notably ov ( 5595 ) , ovi ( 5290 ) and nv . given our limited spectral coverage ,",
    "we are unable to comment on the presence of oxygen .",
    "however , we find marginal evidence for the nv 4603/4619    emission lines reported by the latter authors .",
    "the spectral region around @xmath23 , shows evidence for the bowen niii - ciii @xmath24    complex and probable civ 4658.3 , although these lines are contaminated by the underlying heii emission .    in fig .  2 , we present the mean red spectrum , which is dominated by strong h@xmath25 emission . although the signal - to - noise ratio is poor , we are able to identify components ( marked s@xmath26 and s@xmath27 , following the nomenclature of c96 ) in emission .",
    "similar features are evident on each side of the heii 4686   and h@xmath2 lines in fig .  1 . these unusual features were first noted in the blue by pakull ( 1994 ) and cowley ( 1996 ) , and interpreted as high velocity components of heii and h@xmath2 .",
    "recently , c96 have confirmed this identification , being unable to attribute the lines to any likely ionic species , and concluding an origin in some type of bipolar outflow .",
    "all the spectra were examined for nightly variations in the strength and shape of the emission lines .",
    "however , no significant changes were apparent in the major lines over the course of the observing run . in tab .  2",
    ", we list the mean equivalent widths of the major emission features for each night , and also for the overall average red and blue spectra .",
    "we give the 1@xmath28 statistical errors , although we caution that systematic uncertainties may arise due to the difficulty of assessing the continuum level for broad based line profiles .",
    "also tabulated are the equivalent widths of the s@xmath27/s@xmath26 emission components .",
    "the wavelengths and relative velocities of the s@xmath27/s@xmath26 components , measured from the average spectra of figs .  1 and 2 , are listed in tab .  3 .",
    "our findings are consistent with the measurements of c96 , supporting the interpretation of these features as doppler - shifted components of the heii and balmer lines .",
    "we see further evidence for high velocity flows within this system in the emission line profiles of heii 4686  and h@xmath2 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the former line exhibits a pronounced blue wing , extending to @xmath3  kms@xmath4 ( see also c96 ) .",
    "furthermore , the blue side of the h@xmath2 emission appears to be absorbed .",
    "051369 lies in one of the fields surveyed by the macho project ( see alcock 1995 ) . as a result of this serendipitous photometric monitoring , a record of the optical variability of this source exists from 1992 august to the present time . for completeness",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "3 the macho light curve of 051369 for the period 1992 aug .  22  1995 nov .  27 .",
    "these observations have recently been published in alcock ( 1996 ) , to which we refer the reader for further details regarding the data acquisition and reduction , and a discussion of the variability .",
    "however , we have also marked on fig .",
    "3 arrows indicating the times at which the system was known to be definitely on and off in x - rays ; we refer to this later in   5.3 and   5.4 .",
    "the optical light curve is dominated by recurrent low states , representing @xmath29  0.8  mag reductions in intensity , which occur at quasi - regular intervals .",
    "in addition , 051369 exhibits erratic variability on shorter timescales , with fluctuations of up to @xmath30  mags occurring on timescales of days .",
    "we have also obtained white - light photometry of 051369 using the saao 1  m telescope at sutherland , south africa .",
    "these observations were made on 1995 feb .  5 ( @xmath31  jd 2449754 - marked `` saao '' on fig .",
    "3 ) , at a time when 051369 was in an optical high state .",
    "the detector was the uct ccd , operating in frame transfer mode .",
    "in this configuration , only half of the chip is exposed , and at the end of the integration , the signal is read out through the masked half . in this way , we are able to obtain consecutive integrations with virtually no ccd dead time . the effective wavelength of the instrument , in the absence of a filter , is approximately that of the johnson v passband , but with a bandwidth of @xmath32  ( fwhm ) . in fig .  4 , we show the resulting light curve , which consists of 1328 10  s exposures , obtained over a continuous 220  min period . the magnitude of 051369 and a comparison star are plotted relative to a local standard .",
    "we see a fading in the brightness of 051369 of @xmath33  mags , which is not observed in the comparison star .",
    "thus , we find evidence that 051369 can exhibit significant optical variability on timescales as short as @xmath21  h. we performed a power spectrum analysis of the data , using the method of scargle ( 1982 ) .",
    "no significant power was revealed within the range of periods to which the search was sensitive ( @xmath29 30s  @xmath34  2hr ) . by adding an artificial sinusoidal component to the data",
    ", we derive an upper limit of @xmath35  mags for the semi - amplitude of any real modulation on these short timescales .",
    "we measured the line velocities of heii  4686 by fitting triple gaussian functions to the line profiles . these fits consisted of a narrow component for the line core , an underlying broader gaussian to account for the red emission shoulder and a further wide , low - amplitude component , to fit the extended blue emission wing , which includes the @xmath24    bowen blend .",
    "we list in tab .",
    "4 the radial velocities of heii  4686 for our 10 blue spectra , obtained from the strong narrow component .",
    "the velocity centroids of the broad components were far less accurately determined , and we do not give these . a triple gaussian fit to the heii  4686 profile of the average blue spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "the periodogram for heii  4686 is shown in fig .",
    "the frequency space ranges from @xmath36  cycles per day , with a search interval of 0.001  cycles per day ( a more wide ranging search failed to reveal further significant power ) .",
    "we have applied the clean algorithm of roberts , lehr and dreher ( 1987 ) , which essentially deconvolves the spectral window from the data .",
    "the major peak is at p@xmath37  d , which is entirely consistent with the `` best '' spectroscopic value of 0.76  d obtained by c96 .",
    "the power arising at 4.54  d ( @xmath38  cycles  d@xmath4 ) is considered due to a one day@xmath4 alias .    given the extremely limited sampling of our dataset , we combined our heii  4686 radial velocities with those of c96 , which were obtained only @xmath39  weeks before our observations . in order to correct for any systematic differences between the data , we first subtracted the mean value from each set .",
    "the cleaned periodogram , shown in fig .",
    "7 , is dominated by a peak at p@xmath0  d , with one day@xmath4 aliases at @xmath40  cycles  d@xmath4 and @xmath41  cycles  d@xmath4 .",
    "we therefore confirm the spectroscopic period suggested by c96 , and find that this is consistent , within the 1@xmath28 errors , with the photometric period of p@xmath1  d ( alcock 1996 ) .",
    "we folded our heii  4686 radial velocities on p@xmath42  d ( this being the most accurate period determination available ) using the photometric ephemeris for the time of maximum optical brightness : t@xmath43 ( alcock 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting radial velocity curve is shown in fig .  8 with a sinusoidal fit .",
    "we obtain a velocity semi - amplitude , k@xmath44kms@xmath4 , a systemic velocity , @xmath45kms@xmath4 and zero crossing phase @xmath46 .",
    "the error on the latter quantity includes the uncertainty in the photometric ephemeris .",
    "we also combined our velocity data with that of c96 ( see   4.1.2 above ) and repeated this procedure , although the data were difficult to fit since c96 give no errors .",
    "this yielded a zero - crossing phase of @xmath47 and velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath48kms@xmath4 , which are not significantly different from the parameters obtained from our data alone .",
    "given the very low amplitude of the modulation and the intrinsic uncertainty in the photometric ephemeris , we are unable to obtain an accurate value for @xmath49 .",
    "thus , it is difficult to draw conclusions from the relative phasing of the light and velocity curves .",
    "however , the data do suggest that at maximum optical light , the velocities are most blue - shifted .",
    "assuming that the heii arises near the compact object , this could be explained if we are viewing the inner irradiated edge of the disk , near the impact point of the stream .",
    "the mass function for the parameters derived from our data alone is f(m ) = pk@xmath50/2@xmath51 g = 0.0002@xmath52 m@xmath53 , which is plotted in fig .  9 for various inclinations ( see also c96 ) .",
    "clearly , if the accretor is a white dwarf , the inclination of the system must be very low , seen close to pole - on .",
    "this conclusion is unaltered for the highest mass function allowed by the uncertainty on the measurement .",
    "whilst it appears statistically unlikely that we are viewing the system close to pole - on ( @xmath54 ) , the following points argue for this possibility ( see also c96 ) :    ( 1 )  if the inclination is not very small ( see above ) , the brightness of the disk would imply unreasonably high accretion rates ( in excess of the eddington limit - see   5.2 ) .",
    "( 2 )  the orbital photometric variations are extremely small ( @xmath55  mag full amplitude - see   1 ) . with a high accretion rate (   5.2 ) and",
    "steady burning at the white dwarf surface (   5.4 ) , the illuminated hemisphere of the secondary would be expected to produce larger variations at higher inclination angles .",
    "for example , the eclipsing sss , cal  87 , exhibits photometric variations of @xmath56  mag ( excluding the eclipse ) for an inclination of @xmath57 ( schmidtke 1993 ; schandl , meyer - hofmeister & meyer 1996 ) .",
    "we note that in such a low inclination system , in which the accretor is a white dwarf , the implied mass of the companion star is such that it would not fill its roche lobe if on the main sequence .",
    "an evolved donor star is therefore required .",
    "we will now discuss the implications of the observations presented here , as well as of other available data , for models of the system .",
    "the first thing we would like to establish is the nature of the compact object . to this goal",
    ", we note that observations of young stellar objects ( reipurth & heathcote 1993 ) , of agn ( blandford 1993 ) , of ss  433 ( vermeulen 1993 ) and of the galactic black hole candidates grs  1915 + 105 ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) and gro  1655 - 40 ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ) _ all _ indicate that the velocities of jets are always of the order of _ the escape velocity from the central object_. the observations presented in   2 ( see also c96 ) indicate bipolar outflows or jet speeds of @xmath58 .",
    "if interpreted as an escape velocity , the observed value of @xmath59 corresponds to a value of the mass to radius ratio of the compact object of @xmath60 , _ which is typical for a white dwarf_. indeed , outflows with velocities of this order have been observed in cataclysmic variables ( drew 1991 ; drew , hoare & woods 1991 ) .",
    "since the value of @xmath61 identifies the accreting object unambiguously as a white dwarf , we check further if the observed luminosity is consistent with a white dwarf burning hydrogen in a shell .",
    "for such an object , the luminosity is related to the white dwarf mass by ( iben & tutukov 1989 ) @xmath62 note that this relation differs somewhat from the usual paczyski - uus relation ( paczyski 1970 ; uus 1970 ) which is appropriate for agb stars which have both hydrogen and helium burning shells .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of 051369 is probably between @xmath63(obtained from an lte model atmosphere fit ; reinsch 1996 ) and @xmath64(obtained assuming a black body fit ; schaeidt , hasinger & trmper 1993 ) .",
    "using eqn .",
    "1 with these values gives a mass of @xmath65 , again consistent with a white dwarf .",
    "much of the optical luminosity of the system is probably generated in the accretion disk ( although some fraction may represent the effects of nuclear burning and of illumination of the accretion disk and the secondary star by the hot white dwarf ) . for a distance modulus of 18.5 to the lmc and @xmath66 ( panagia 1991 )",
    ", we obtain ( in the optical high states ) @xmath67 . _",
    "if _ we assume that the entire luminosity comes from a standard accretion disk then , using the fact that the luminosity of the accretion disk is given approximately by ( webbink 1987 ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the accretion rate and @xmath70 is the inclination angle , we obtain for @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( see   4.2 ) , an accretion rate of @xmath73 .",
    "this accretion rate is of the order of the eddington value , and it indicates that at least some fraction of the optical light is due to illumination ( and perhaps nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface ) .",
    "it probably remains true , however , that the accretion rate in this system is extremely high .",
    "another indication of the fact that the accretion rate in 051369 may be higher than in other similar systems ( cal  83 ) comes from the observation of the bipolar outflow (   2.2 and   5.1 ) .",
    "typically , the mass flux in jets is of the order of 130% of the disk accretion rate ( lizano 1988 ) , and while not all the objects which exhibit jets have luminosities near the eddington limit ( although ss  433 does ) , it is certainly the case that the intermittent nature of the jets in young stellar objects seems to be associated with episodes of an increased accretion rate through the disk ( reipurth & heathcote 1993 ) .    the observed drops in the optical luminosity , by @xmath74  mag (   3 ) , if interpreted as a reduction in the accretion rate , correspond to a decrease in @xmath69 by a factor @xmath29  3 .",
    "we should note , however , that if the optical luminosity is actually dominated by reprocessed radiation from the accretion disk and/or the secondary star , both being irradiated by the steady burning white dwarf , then the decrease in @xmath69 could be by a larger factor .",
    "such occasional drops in the accretion rate are observed in many nova - like variables and in particular in the group of cataclysmic variables known as vy scl stars ( shafter 1992 ; robinson 1981 ; honeycutt 1995 ) .",
    "similarly to the case of 051369 , the downward transitions in vy scl stars also occur on a timescale of tens of days ( hudec , huth & fuhrmann 1984 ; liller 1980 ; rosino , romano & marziani 1993 ; honeycutt 1995 ) .",
    "further evidence for the relation between the bipolar outflows and the accretion rate may be inferred from comparison of spectroscopic observations obtained during both high and low states .",
    "optical spectroscopy obtained during a low state in december 1993 ( c96 ; reinsch 1996 ) revealed the equivalent widths of the emission lines to be significantly weaker than in high state observations .",
    "there are four main ways in which an accreting white dwarf can exhibit transient x - ray outbursts : ( i )  the outbursts may represent some phases in thermonuclear flashes occurring when a critical mass for ignition is accumulated ( iben 1982 ; prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) , examples of this behaviour being provided by classical novae ; ( ii )  the x - ray outbursts may be the consequence of a photospheric contraction during a nuclear shell burning phase ( even if the burning was steady ; macdonald , fujimoto & truran 1985 ; gelman 1993 ; krautter 1996 ) ; again , this behaviour has been observed in some nova systems ; ( iii )  the x - ray luminosity may be generated in shocks resulting from the interaction of an ejected shell with the ism ; ( iv )  the outbursts may simply represent epochs in which the x - ray source is not shielded by intervening material ( pakull 1996 ) .",
    "examining the x - ray data _ alone _ it is difficult to rule out regular thermonuclear flashes as a possible cause for the recurrent x - ray outbursts ( this was , in fact , the model proposed by kahabka 1995 ) .",
    "however , when the x - ray data are examined _ together _ with the optical data , flashes caused by the accumulation of a critical mass become extremely unlikely .",
    "the reason is simply the fact that the second and the third x - ray outbursts observed in the system in july 1993 and in december 1994 occurred _ during optical minima _ ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , while _ no outbursts were observed during optical high states _",
    "( schaeidt 1996 ; pakull 1993 ) .",
    "if this represents the rule ( rather than being an accident ) , then it is very difficult to reconcile with a thermonuclear flash model , which is normally accompanied by radius expansion and an increased optical luminosity ( see livio 1994 for a discussion ) . even if a thermonuclear flash was able to produce a decrease in the optical luminosity ( for example , if it led only to a modest expansion , but which nevertheless managed to destroy the disk ) , this would _ follow _ the x - ray rise , contrary to what is probably observed ( see   5.4 and fig .  3 ) .",
    "we may thus rule out the thermonuclear flash model .",
    "the shock emission model ( ( iii ) above ) may also be eliminated as a possible source for the increase in the x - rays , since the ejection of a shell is normally a consequence of significant expansion ( prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) .",
    "we are therefore left with the episodic unveiling of a permanent x - ray source or contraction during a steady shell burning phase as the most probable origins for the increase in the x - ray luminosity ( see pakull 1993 ; pakull 1996 ) . in the former model",
    ", the white dwarf is burning steadily all the time , but is visible ( in x - rays ) only during phases of low mass transfer rate ( see   5.4 for a possible cause of such phases ) . at other times , the wind and bipolar outflow are optically thick to soft x - rays . it should be noted that the decrease in the optical should precede the rise in the x - rays , which is probably consistent with the available data ( see   5.4 ) .",
    "we may investigate whether the outflow can indeed shield the source using the following simplified approximation .",
    "if we assume a spherical outflow , characterised by a velocity law of the type @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the outflow velocity at a large distance , then we can calculate the optical depth in the outflow , @xmath77 here , @xmath78 is the proton mass , @xmath28 is the absorption cross - section to the soft x - rays , @xmath79 is the mass outflow rate and @xmath80 is a function of @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the sonic radius in the outflow and @xmath2 is the exponent in the velocity law . for values of @xmath2 in the range @xmath83 and @xmath84 , both typical for nova - like variables ( knigge 1995 ) , @xmath85 .",
    "if we use , for example , the photoelectric absorption cross - section at @xmath86  kev from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) , @xmath87  kms@xmath4 , and @xmath88  cm , we obtain that the source will be totally obscured ( @xmath89 ) for @xmath90  yr@xmath4 .",
    "this number should not be taken as representing the real value , since the actual obscuration depends crucially on the geometry of the real outflow from the accretion disk ( knigge , woods & drew 1995 ) , especially in a nearly pole - on system .    whilst the above discussion does indicate that a scenario of this type is , in principle , viable",
    ", we find the white dwarf photospheric contraction model more reasonable ; this is discussed fully in   5.4 below .",
    "it is important to note that the appearance of a relatively short lived x - ray phase due to contraction of the photosphere , during shell burning , has been established observationally for both gq mus ( gelman 1993 ; shanley 1995 ) and v1974  cyg ( krautter 1996 ) .",
    "this puts us now in a position where we can attempt to propose a comprehensive model for the system , taking all the available observational data into consideration .",
    "the principal features of the photospheric contraction model which emerge as a result of the discussion in the previous sections are the following .",
    "the system consists of a white dwarf which may be fairly massive ( both because of the constraints imposed by the accretion luminosity , see   5.2 , and by the inclination angle ,   4.2 ; see also below ) , which accretes from an _ evolved _ companion .",
    "the accretion rate is normally very high ( perhaps @xmath91yr@xmath4 ) , at a value which is near the top of the steady burning strip in the @xmath92 plane ( nomoto 1982 ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the white dwarf is slightly inflated ( by perhaps no more than a factor @xmath17 in radius ; kovetz & prialnik 1994 ) , and most of the shell luminosity is probably emitted in the uv .",
    "the mass transfer rate , and concomitantly the optical luminosity , suffer occasional drops by about a factor  3 or more .",
    "this is a very similar phenomenon to the one exhibited by vy scl stars and some nova - like variables ( honeycutt 1995 ; honeycutt , robertson & turner 1995 ) .",
    "the important point here is that 051369 , like the vy scl stars , experiences only _ downward _ transitions .",
    "livio & pringle ( 1994 ) suggested a model for vy scl stars , in which the reduced mass transfer rate is a consequence of a magnetic spot covering the @xmath93 region .",
    "vy scl stars are normally found in the period range 34 hrs and in the livio & pringle model , this is a consequence of the fact that when the rotation rate of the star ( which is coupled to the orbit ) increases , so does the magnetic activity and the fraction of the stellar surface covered with spots ( krster 1992 ) .",
    "one may therefore wonder why the secondary in 051369 , which has an orbital period of @xmath94  d , should exhibit a similar behaviour .",
    "however , it should be remembered that the secondary in 051369 is evolved . the physical quantity which characterizes the magnetic activity is the rossby number , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the convective overturn time in the envelope ( schrijver 1994 ) . since evolved stars have deeper convective envelopes ( longer @xmath96 ) than main sequence stars , they exhibit the same level of activity at longer @xmath97 ( see schrijver 1994 for a review ) .",
    "in fact , the orbital period of 0513 - 69 is close to the range spanned by the magnetically active rs  cvn stars .    once the accretion rate drops , the photosphere contracts slightly ( kovetz & prialnik 1994 ; kato 1985 ) , raising the effective temperature and thus producing an increase in the x - ray luminosity .",
    "it is important to note in this respect that the decrease in the optical luminosity , _ precedes _ the rise in the x - rays .",
    "3 shows the times at which the x - rays were known to be off ( arrows marked `` nx '' ) and on ( arrows marked `` x '' ) , in relation to the optical behaviour .",
    "using the fact that the x - ray rise time is of order 6  days ( schaeidt 1996 - see also   1 ) , we may be fairly confident that , at least in the x - ray outburst of december 1994 ( day number @xmath29 1715 in fig .",
    "3 ) , the optical had already started to fall before the x - rays turned on . in this respect ,",
    "the episodic unveiling model ( discussed in   5.3 above ) is also consistent with the available data .",
    "however , reinsch ( 1996 ) have shown that the optical low states of 051369 are accompanied by a reddening of @xmath33  mags , which is quantitatively consistent with the decreased disk illumination resulting from a contraction in the white dwarf radius .",
    "furthermore , the photospheric contraction model is able to provide a natural explanation of details in the light curve morphology , as described below .",
    "the increased x - ray flux irradiates the companion star and , either by inflating material above the secondary s photosphere and causing it to be transferred ( ritter 1988 ) , or by heating the magnetic spot area ( which is generally cooler , parker 1979 ) , causes the mass transfer rate to increase again .",
    "this produces the step - like behaviour of the optical light curve when the luminosity increases , or the small jump in the optical luminosity in the middle of the low state ( around day 1539 , fig .",
    "the following should also be noted : in _ all _ cases , the luminosity immediately following the end of one of these low states is slightly higher than the average between these events ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the above model , since the temporary blocking of the mass transfer ( by a magnetic spot ) , plus the effect of the irradiation of the secondary by the x - rays , is likely to result in a somewhat increased mass transfer rate , once the blocking is removed .",
    "a question which needs to be addressed is whether the contraction and expansion of the white dwarf photosphere can occur on the observed timescale ( @xmath29 1 week ) .",
    "an examination of the results of kovetz & prialnik ( 1994 ) and kato ( 1996 ) reveals that this is indeed possible , if the white dwarf is massive ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this can be easily understood if we realise that the contraction timescale can be reasonably approximated by the duration of the mass - ejection phase ( livio 1992 ) : @xmath99 ^{3/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is nearly a constant and @xmath101 is the chandrasekhar mass . using a value for @xmath102  days , which fits the observations of 84 novae in m31 and 15 novae in the lmc ( della valle & livio 1995 ) , gives a contraction timescale of less than 4 days for a @xmath103 white dwarf .",
    "assuming that the main ingredients of the model outlined above are correct , we may ask what is the cause for the difference in the x - ray behaviour of 051369 and similar sources ( such as cal  83 ) .",
    "the main difference is probably in the ratio of the mean mass transfer rate to the rate at which steady burning occurs ( for the given white dwarf mass ) .",
    "this ratio is probably higher for 051369 , a hypothesis which is supported by the greater optical luminosity of this system ( @xmath104 in the high states , compared with @xmath105 for cal  83 ; cowley 1993 ) .",
    "evidence for a high mass transfer rate is provided both by the brightness of the accretion disk , and by the fact that a bipolar outflow is not observed in cal  83 ( c96 ) .",
    "finally , we should point out that the main model discussed in the present work (   5.4 ) is based on the probable observation that the rise in x - rays came _ after _ the optical luminosity was observed to drop .",
    "thus , it can be tested directly by long - term monitoring of the system in the optical and x - ray regimes .",
    "in particular , the model predicts that increases in the x - ray luminosity should follow drops ( by @xmath29  1  mag ) in the optical luminosity . if future observations will show that this is indisputably the case , then the model of photospheric contraction will be further strengthened .",
