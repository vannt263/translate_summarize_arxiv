    "diffractive scattering of energetic electrons on various nuclei allowed hofstadter and collaborators to determine the radius and the surface thickness of electric charge distribution inside the nuclei , and also resulted in two simple phenomenological formulae : namely , that the charge radius scales with increasing mass number as ( 1.07 @xmath1 0.02)@xmath2 fm , while the surface thickness , within the errors of the observation , is a constant of ( 2.4 @xmath1 0.3 ) fm  @xcite . by increasing the momentum of the elastically scattered particle one can probe deeper and deeper details of matter , due to the de broglie duality @xmath3 between particle properties like momentum @xmath4 and wave - like properties like wavelength @xmath5 . to resolve the internal charge distribution inside atomic nuclei , hofstadter and colleagues used electrons with bombarding energies of @xmath6 mev , corresponding to spatial resolutions of @xmath7 fm .",
    "currently , elastic scattering of protons on protons has been experimentally investigated by the cern lhc experiment totem , at the colliding energies of @xmath0 tev , corresponding to a spatial resolution in the center of mass system of @xmath8 fm , which is sufficiently small to study the internal structure of protons .    in the present paper",
    "we exploit these experimental results and check how far can one progress with the qualitative as well as quantitative description of the differential cross section of elastic proton - proton scattering at isr as well as at cern lhc colliding energies , covering an impressive range from @xmath9 gev to 7 tev .",
    "our investigations were motivated not only by the first experimental results of totem on elastic proton - proton collisions  @xcite , but also by an inspiring series of theoretical papers by a. bialas and a. bzdak  @xcite , that considered pion - proton , proton - proton and nucleus - nucleus scattering using a geometrical picture .    in the present investigation , following and improving the model of bialas and bzdak  @xcite a quark - diquark based geometrical model is used to describe the isr and the recent lhc totem data",
    ". we will refer to this bialas bzdak model as the bb model or bb , for convenience .",
    "note also that a diquark or correlated quark - quark structure has to be considered , given that a similar model with three independent , uncorrelated constituent quarks was not able to describe the elastic pp scattering data , as pointed out already in ref .",
    "@xcite .    by definition",
    ", the earlier considered bb model has no real part , and consequently it is singular at the diffractive minimum .",
    "the diffractive minimum , the _ dip _ , was first seen in the data collected with the cern intersecting storage rings ( isr ) @xcite .",
    "the totem data shows that the dip is shifted towards smaller @xmath10 values at @xmath11 tev , consequently with smaller experimental errors , and these data also exclude a possible vanishing value of the differential cross - section at this dip position .    therefore to describe the data , including the dip , is a challenging task .",
    "we were able to fit the singular bb model to the isr data only in the case , when 3 data points were left out from the data at the dip , and even this did not help at lhc energies : the bb model simply failed in the dip region of totem data  @xcite . a recent study  @xcite , which extended the parton approach , using gluon cascades , from hard processes to describe high - energy soft and semihard processes , was also not able to describe the totem data .",
    "its 3-channel eikonal extension with only one pomeron missed a quantitative data description at lhc energies  @xcite just as well .",
    "however , as it was demonstrated recently in ref .  @xcite using the good - walker formalism with a single , effective pomeron , it is possible to describe the pp elastic differential cross - section and the energy dependence of the total cross - section @xmath12 , as well as proton dissociation into low mass system in a large energy range from cern - isr to lhc energies .    in another recent study ,",
    "that we become aware during the finalization phase of our manuscript , totem data on the differential cross - section of elastic pp scattering at @xmath13 tev were described by a relatively simple parametrization  @xcite that includes two exponentials and a phase , where the first exponential is suitably modified to take into account the detailed structure of forward scattering and to include the description of the electromagnetic form - factor of the protons .",
    "a multi - channel eikonal model was considered and found to describe well totem elastic scattering data @xmath14 at 7 tev and also pp scattering at 53 gev isr energies with some interesting physics conclusions : in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that elastic , diffractive and total pp scattering cross - sections at 7 tev within errors saturate the so - called miettinen - pumplin bound  @xcite , namely that @xmath15 .",
    "this result is consistent with very large parton - parton scattering cross - sections at these energies .",
    "a detailed analysis of the real and the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude was presented recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a regular dependence of the fit parameters as a function of @xmath16 was observed , and this behaviour was found to be nearly continuous even at the lower , isr energies , but pointing out the opening of a new mechanism in the energy range of @xmath17 gev as indicated by a perturbation of the otherwise smooth energy dependence of the model parameters .",
    "a qualitatively similar observation was also made in ref .",
    "@xcite , that noted that the geometrical picture of pp collisions should be modified considerably when entering the domain of ultra - high energy collisions , and pointed out that totem data at @xmath18 tev already indicate the onset of a transition to this region .    in our present study",
    ", we investigate in detail a geometrical model of proton - proton collisions , and indeed find that a qualitative change in elastic pp scattering can be observed when moving from the top isr energy of 63 gev to the lhc energy of 7 tev , which is particularly important when the study is focusing on the dip region .",
    "we perform our analysis using a generalized bialas - bzdak model .",
    "the bb model originates in glauber models , which were successfully developed to provide a geometrical as well as quantum - optical picture of nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "the cross - section is calculated by taking into account all possible combinations of individual inelastic processes  @xcite . in the present work the bb model",
    "is supplemented with real part following ref .",
    "therefore the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude at zero momentum transfer , @xmath19 is not zero .",
    "we refer to our model version as @xmath20 . in total four free model parameters",
    "are used in @xmath20 , which is rather small .",
    "the qcd - based , well - known model of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the totem data is refitted successfully with the help of hard pomeron exchange , uses 15 free parameters . another relevant qcd inspired model applies 9 free parameters , where the pomeron intercept and the interesting dynamical gluon mass are the most important  @xcite .",
    "we present two , intuitively found phenomenological relations also .",
    "the first one suggests that the total cross - section can be estimated using an effective proton radius , which is a combination of our three radius fit parameters .",
    "we tested this formula with the singular , original version of the bb model earlier  @xcite and now we present its test with the non - singular , generalized @xmath20 model . similarly to the relation of the nuclear radius to the mass number found by hofstadter , this relation is found to be only approximate , but giving a good estimate of the total cross section and also its increase with increasing energies can be related to the modification of the internal structure of protons with increasing colliding energies .",
    "the second relation shows that the position of the dip , @xmath21 , is related to the total cross - section , so given the total pp scattering cross - section the position of the dip can be predicted .",
    "proton - proton scattering is described in the bb model as a collision of two composite objects .",
    "each of them is assumed to contain a constituent quark and a diquark .",
    "the parametrization of the scattering situation is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ singlecoll ] .    in the original bb model",
    "the interaction between quarks and diquarks is assumed to be purely absorptive , therefore the forward scattering amplitude of the bb model has no real part . in the present paper their formula is supplemented with real part .",
    "this modification significantly improves the ability of the model to describe elastic @xmath22 scattering @xmath14 in the dip region .",
    "the inelastic proton - proton cross - section in the impact parameter space for a fixed impact parameter @xmath23 is given by the following integral @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the integral is taken over the two - dimensional transverse position vectors of the quarks @xmath26 , @xmath27 and diquarks @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the integral describes the convolution of the quark - diquark distributions of the two incoming protons with a @xmath30 function which in the original bb model provides the probability of inelastic interaction at given impact parameter vector @xmath23 and at given quark , diquark transverse positions . in the present work this function is generalized to complex values , indicated by the subscript @xmath31 , with the more detailed motivation given after entailing the functional form of @xmath30 .",
    "the complex valued @xmath30 function in the @xmath32 case reduces to the real valued @xmath33 function of the original bb model  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the @xmath31 parameter is motivated by the glauber - velasco model @xcite .",
    "bialas and bzdak in ref .",
    "@xcite supposed that the quark - diquark distribution of the proton follows a gaussian shape @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the variance of the quark and diquark distance inside the proton and the @xmath36 parameter is the mass ratio of the quark and diquark .",
    "the value of @xmath37 would indicate a weakly bound diquark .",
    "the center of mass in the transverse plane is preserved with the help of a two - dimensional delta function .",
    "the original bb model supposes that protons are scattered elastically if and only if all of its constituents are scattered elastically  @xcite @xmath38\\ , ,      \\label{glauber expansion }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the inelastic differential cross - sections of the constituents are parametrized with gaussian distributions as well @xmath39    a detailed study of the unmodified bb model , corresponding to the @xmath32 case of our present work and also to a probabilistic interpretation of the forward scattering amplitude , has been completed recently in ref .",
    "it was shown that this model describes the main features of the @xmath14 data well in the isr energy range of @xmath40 gev , except three data points around the dip of the @xmath14 distribution , which were omitted from the optimalization  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the original bb model neglects the real part of the forward scattering amplitude , which results in @xmath41 around the diffractive minimum , a feature that does not correspond to the shape of pp elastic scattering data .    from this point forward , a generalized version of the bb model is discussed which is able to describe the dip region of elastic scattering @xmath14 at isr energies , by modifying expression  ( [ glauber expansion ] ) .",
    "it takes into account , with a phenomenologically introduced parameter @xmath31 , that the proton is not always scattered elastically even if all of its constituents are scattered elastically .",
    "this generalized model is referred to as @xmath31bb model .",
    "the @xmath31bb model is introduced with a purely imaginary factor in the formula @xmath42    the new parameter @xmath31 is determined from the analysis of data .",
    "the @xmath32 case corresponds to a situation , when the proton always scatters elastically if its constituents scatter elastically .",
    "parameter @xmath31 is introduced in a way that is motivated by the @xmath31 parameter of the glauber - velasco model of refs .",
    "parameter @xmath31 can be considered as the @xmath19 parameter of parton - parton level scattering where @xmath19 is the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude at zero momentum transfer .    from unitarity",
    "the elastic amplitude is the following @xmath43 where the elastic amplitude @xmath44 is a complex valued function in our case ; note that an imaginary unit is suppressed in the notation of the original bb model  @xcite .",
    "important to note also that the domain of the square root in eq .",
    "( [ telastic ] ) remains @xmath45 even if @xmath32 .",
    "recently , the important role of the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude in shaping @xmath14 at the dip and in the orear region was highlighted in @xcite .    in momentum transfer representation",
    "the amplitude of elastic scattering is given with the fourier - transformation @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the zeroth bessel - function of the first kind .",
    "finally the differential cross - section is obtained as @xmath49 the real and imaginary part combine together to describe the dip region of the differential cross section @xmath14 , even if @xmath31 is only slightly different from 0 .",
    "the results , as we shall also demonstrate below , will be qualitatively different from the bb model .",
    "this subsection is devoted to describe the remaining parts of the bb model when the diquark in the proton is assumed to scatter as a single entity . in this case",
    "the two model parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be expressed with the help of @xmath53 if one supposes an idealized situation where the constituent diquark contains twice as many partons than the constituent quark without shadowing effects .",
    "this assumption may decrease the number of free parameters by two .",
    "the inelastic cross - sections @xmath54 are supposed to be proportional to the parton numbers . according to the assumption @xmath55 which corresponds to the case of no shadowing effect in the proton - proton scattering .",
    "consequently @xmath56    with these ingredients the computation of eq .  (",
    "[ elsoegyenlet ] ) reduces to perform gaussian integrals .",
    "two of the dirac delta functions simply express the transverse diquark coordinates with the corresponding quark coordinate using the mass ratio @xmath36 @xmath57    the remaining four gaussian integrals lead to the following expression for each term in the inelastic proton - proton cross - section formula ( [ elsoegyenlet ] ) @xmath58    where @xmath59+\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)^2 d_{qd , dq}\\,,\\notag\\\\          \\gamma&=c_{qd , dq}d_{qq , dd } + c_{qq , dd}d_{qd , dq }              \\label{master_formula1 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath60 where the @xmath61 parameters are abbreviations . formulas ( [ master_formula ] ) , ( [ master_formula1 ] ) and ( [ master_formula2 ] ) are equivalent with the corresponding formulas of the original bb model @xcite , although they are presented in a terser form .",
    "the collision of the protons in @xmath22 scattering is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ qqcoll ] , in case the diquark scatters as a composite object including two constituent quarks .",
    "bialas and bzdak @xcite supposed that the two quarks follow a gaussian distribution inside the diquark @xmath63 where the transverse positions of the quarks are indicated with @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "the distance @xmath66 is the rms of the separation of the quarks inside the diquark .",
    "it is defined as @xmath67 which expresses that the diquark is composed of two quarks which are separated by a distance @xmath66 . in the present case",
    "the inelastic cross - sections @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 have to be factorized using the @xmath71 inelastic cross - section using expansion ( [ glauber expansion ] ) .",
    "the formula for @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the following @xmath72 @xmath70 is more complicated , and is given in details in refs .",
    "the inelastic cross - section ( [ elsoegyenlet ] ) can be calculated using the master formula ( [ master_formula ] ) as before .",
    "bialas and bzdak originally used the total cross - section , the slope parameter @xmath73 , the position of the dip and the position of the first diffractive maximum after the dip to determine the value of the fit parameters by solving 4 equations with 4 unknowns @xcite .",
    "they found , that the resulting parameters provide a good overall description of elastic scattering data at isr energies .",
    "however , neither the errors of the parameters nor the fit quality description with a @xmath74 test were provided .    in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the errors of the original bb model parameters a different method was applied , utilizing all the information in the data set by a multiparameter fit . in the present study we improved not only the fitting method , but also the bb model itself .",
    "we introduced the real part of the forward scattering amplitude with parameter @xmath31 motivated by the glauber - velasco model of @xcite .",
    "this resulted in a new feature of the @xmath31bb model , namely the ability to describe the data also around the diffractive minimum .",
    "second , we have used the cern minuit fitting package  @xcite to determine the best values of the model parameters together with their errors . in the next section our results",
    "are presented , while we discuss the findings and compare them with earlier results in the discussion part .",
    "in this section the results of our minuit fits are presented for the isr @xcite and totem @xcite proton - proton elastic scattering data .",
    "the scenario when the diquark is assumed to scatter as a single entity is considered first , which is followed by the fit results for the case when the diquark is considered as composite object . to provide a fair comparison among the model descriptions on the different dataset at different @xmath76 ,",
    "the @xmath10 region of the fits is limited to the first totem publication . in the discussion section ,",
    "the fit quality is also studied in special fits to the totem data in the low @xmath10 region .",
    "as we shall see , even the improved bb model can not describe the totem data in the whole @xmath77 region .",
    "the results show that thanks to the new parameter @xmath31 , which generates the real part of the forward scattering amplitude , the fits improve significantly and describe the data also in the dip region , as compared to the @xmath32 case presented in refs @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be interpreted such that the proton does not necessarily scatter elastically even if all its constituents are scattered elastically .",
    "this effect is small at lower collision energies , however it becomes , as we shall detail , more and more prominent with increasing energies .",
    "in this subsection the fit results are collected in case the diquark is assumed to scatter as a single entity .",
    "this version of the model was fitted to the proton - proton elastic scattering data both at isr @xcite and at lhc @xcite energy as well .",

    "[ single_visualization ] .",
    "the confidence levels , and model parameters with their errors are summarized in table  [ tab : singleparameters ] .",
    "the figures contain two phenomenological relations below the legend .",
    "the first relation suggests that the total - cross section is proportional to the area of a disk with an effective radius @xmath78 , which is the square root of the quadratic sum of @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath35 @xmath81 @xmath82    this formula was originally proposed for the bb model in @xcite , and was found to be model independently valid in both the @xmath50 and in the @xmath83 models with a precision of @xmath84 . in the current paper",
    "we validate this formula for the @xmath85 case .",
    "numerically , we have found another phenomenological formula , which indicates that the @xmath86 position of the first diffractive minimum @xmath87 multiplied with the total - cross section @xmath12 is nearly constant @xmath88 where @xmath89 mb gev@xmath90 .",
    "the test of these relations for each energy with both the @xmath50 and @xmath83 models is given on the figures and the results are collected and described in our discussion part .",
    "gev in case the diquark is assumed to be a single entity .",
    "note that although @xmath31 is not significantly different from @xmath91 , a tiny value of @xmath31 makes the fit behavior in the dip region significantly better , than the @xmath32 case , indicated by a dashed line .",
    "the lower panel shows the deviation of the fitted theory ( solid line ) from the experimental data at that point .",
    "note that below the legend we show also the test of two phenomenological relations which are discussed in the text .",

    "note that the @xmath50 version of the @xmath20 model fails in the low-@xmath10 region , where @xmath92 of ref .",
    "@xcite is underestimated .",
    "this may be the reason why @xmath96 is only 42% close to 1 . ]",
    ".the @xmath76 dependence of the confidence levels and the fit parameters in case the diquark is assumed to be a single entity , where the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 are fixed .",
    "the diquark size , as well as the inelasticity parameter @xmath31 increase significantly with @xmath76 , indicating that the proton became larger and less elastic as @xmath76 is increased to lhc energies . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can ask the question , why and at what range of four momentum transfer @xmath86 such a simple model should work .",
    "apparently , for sufficiently large @xmath86 we start to probe a distance that becomes smaller than @xmath99 fm , the size of a constituent quark in the bialas - bzdak picture , or , the even larger diquark scale .",
    "thus , for a large enough @xmath86 the simple bialas - bzdak model , and even its generalized version presented in the current manuscript , is expected to fail .",
    "indeed , totem observed that above the dip structure the functional form of the differential cross - section changes , and can be described with a power law @xmath100 with an exponent @xmath101 for @xmath86-values between 1.5 gev@xmath90 and 2.0 gev@xmath90  @xcite .",
    "this totem result on the large @xmath86 elastic scattering is consistent with the perturbative qcd prediction , based on a spin-1 gluon exchange picture , that predicted an energy independent power - low tail of the @xmath14 distribution with @xmath102  @xcite .",
    "in this work we have generalized the geometrical bialas - bzdak model of elastic proton - proton scattering by allowing for a real part of the forward scattering amplitude using the same geometrical picture , but assuming that a proton - proton scattering may become inelastic even in the case when all scattering of the constituents of the colliding protons is elastic ( but not completely collinear ) .",
    "this generalization resulted in a successful description of the dip region of elastic proton - proton scattering in the isr energy region and resulted in a significant , qualitative improvement of the ability of this model to describe elastic proton - proton scattering at 7 tev colliding energies as measured by the totem collaboration at cern lhc .",
    "we have also found that the generalized bialas - bzdak model can describe only the small @xmath86 data set and therefore the total cross - section @xmath12 at lhc , if the fit range is limited to a relatively low @xmath86 range",
    ". however , even this generalized bialas - bzdak model fails , if the large @xmath86 region data of totem is included , more precisely we find no good quality fits in the @xmath103 gev@xmath75 region , where @xmath104 gev .",
    "this result can be interpreted as a qualitative change in elastic proton - proton scattering at the 7 tev lhc energies as compared to the top isr energies , due to the opening of a new channel in this reaction .",
    "it would be interesting to collect data at rhic and at lower lhc energies to determine the energy region where this transition happens and the new physics channel opens .",
    "based on the geometrical picture behind the bialas - bzdak model , we have identified and tested the validity of two simple phenomenological formulas .",
    "our first formula relates the total proton - proton scattering cross - section to an effective radius , that is the quadratic sum of the radii of a quark and a diquark as well as the distance between the center of mass of the diquark and the quark inside the proton .",
    "regardless of the detailed structure of the diquarks , and independently of the values of the real part of the forward scattering amplitude , this formula gives a model independent estimate for the total cross - section with a typical 10 % precision at isr energies , that becomes worse at lhc energies , but our data analysis nevertheless suggests that the increase of the total cross - section of proton - proton scattering is mainly due to the increase of the quark - diquark separation with increasing colliding energies , while the size of the constituent quarks and diquarks is approximately independent of the colliding energies .",
    "our second formula establishes a relation between the total cross - section of proton - proton scattering and the position of the dip in the differential cross - section : in particular , we find that the product of these two quantities is a model independent constant .",
    "we also demonstrated that this formula is remarkably precise , it is satisfied by the isr data within one standard deviations , while at lhc the formula is also satisfied by the data within 3 standard deviations .    given",
    "that the energy dependence of the total cross - section is very well described by linear or quadratic polynomials in @xmath105 , or by glauber monte - carlo simulations in case of proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions , our result can in principle be well used to predict the position of the dip in the differential cross section of elastic scattering at various energies and colliding systems .",
    "a detailed application of this relation to predict the dip position in p - pb elastic scattering will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",

    "<S> the bialas - bzdak model of elastic proton - proton scattering is generalized to the case when the real part of the parton - parton level forward scattering amplitude is non - vanishing . </S>",
    "<S> such a generalization enables the model to describe well the dip region of the differential cross - section of elastic scattering at the isr energies , and improves significantly the ability of the model to describe also the recent totem data at @xmath0 tev lhc energy . within this framework , both the increase of the total cross - section , as well as the decrease of the location of the dip with increasing colliding energies , </S>",
    "<S> is related to the increase of the quark - diquark distance and to the increase of the  fragility \" of the protons with increasing energies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we present and test the validity of two new phenomenological relations : one of them relates the total p+p cross - section to an effective , model - independent proton radius , while the other relates the position of the dip in the differential elastic cross - section to the measured value of the total cross - section . </S>"
