    "this can be understood by considering the transfer of information from the state of the system to the measurement results from the single observable : if we describe this transfer of information from @xmath109 elements of the density operator of the input state by a matrix @xmath78 , the rank of this matrix must be @xmath109 , i.e. its inverse must exist . in practice , it is necessary to choose a transfer matrix that is far from the singular case , to maximize the precision with which the input state can be calculated from the measurement results .",
