    "polar ring galaxies are peculiar galaxies encircled by a ring of stars , gas and dust with perpendicular spin @xcite .",
    "these distinct kinematic components are confirmed by observations of their h i distribution @xcite , which generally exhibit extended emission throughout the polar ring with a central gap .",
    "kinematically , we see that some of these structures are more disk - like than ring - like @xcite , are massive enough to be self gravitating @xcite , and have the suggestion of spiral arms @xcite .",
    "the central galaxy is generally a rotationally supported s0 or elliptical galaxy and shares a common geometric center with the polar disk , however is relatively gas poor .",
    "polar disk galaxies are relatively rare , with only a few percent of s0s that have now or have had a polar ring @xcite .",
    "they are particularly useful and interesting as their perpendicular dynamics allow a three dimensional probe of the dark matter potential .",
    "the formation mechanism for polar disks is not entirely clear , but presumably requires a second formation event to form the perpendicular spin components .",
    "originally , a major merger or close encounter was assumed necessary @xcite , however neither theory resolves the problem of the central disk retaining its rotational support in systems with significantly massive polar disks , as with ngc 4650a .",
    "the issue is also confused by indeterminate ages of observed polar disks , which are partly dependent on the stability of polar oriented structures @xcite .",
    "more recent theories and simulations suggest cold accretion along cosmological filaments may form and continue to feed these polar disks @xcite .",
    "we have found a polar disk galaxy in relatively isolated , void - like conditions , situated in a tenuous sheet - like configuration between two voids .",
    "it was found as part of an h i survey of 15 void galaxies selected using an early version of the watershed void finder ( @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , with each galaxy in a different void .",
    "it has no optical polar ring visible in the sdss imaging but a massive , extended h i polar disk .",
    "this suggests cold flow accretion as the most likely formation mechanism , and sheds a new and surprising light on the nature of galaxies populating the most desolate areas in the universe ( cf e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observations are described in  [ obs ] , shown in  [ results ] , and comparisons with theory made in  [ dis ] .",
    "sdss j102819.24 + 623502.6 is part of a pilot for a larger study of galaxy formation in underdense regions of the sdss redshift survey ( stanonik et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "our lonely galaxy is situated at a ra & dec ( j2000 ) of 10:28:19.02 + 62:35:02.0 and a redshift of z= 0.0178446 .",
    "it is fairly blue , with a g - band magnitude of 17.67 and r - band magnitude of 17.41 as reported in the sixth data release from the sdss .",
    "note that these images reach to magnitudes of g @xmath0 23 , as the drift - scan mode employed by the sdss results in an effective exposure time in each band of 54.1 s @xcite .",
    "a distance of 76 mpc is calculated assuming h@xmath1 = 70 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , which gives a scale of 1@xmath3=370 pc .",
    "the 21 cm line of our target was observed for 12 hours at westerbork synthesis radio telescope(wsrt ) in maxi - short configuration , which optimizes imaging of very extended sources in a single track observation with shortest baselines of 36 , 54 , 72 and 90 meters .",
    "we observed in 4 ifs each with 512 channels , a 10 mhz bandwidth , and 2 polarizations .",
    "the target redshift corresponds to an optical heliocentric velocity of 5302 km s@xmath2 , so channel increments of 19.5 khz give a velocity resolution of 4.27 km s@xmath2 .",
    "all calibration was done using standard aips procedures .",
    "continuum emission was subtracted from the uv data by linear interpolation from the line free channels .",
    "image cubes were created with a clean box around the h i emission that cleaned down to 2 mjy beam@xmath2 ( 4 @xmath4 ) .",
    "images were created with uniform weighting and robust 1 to give a balance of high resolution , a beam size of 22.1 x 19.5 , with low noise , a rms of 0.5 mjy beam@xmath2 .",
    "this corresponds to a 3@xmath4 detection limit in column density of @xmath5 @xmath6 and in mass of @xmath7 for a galaxy with velocity width 100 km s@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 moment maps were made , with 1.5@xmath4 clipping applied to a mask that is hanning and gaussian smoothed over 3 cells , both in velocity and spatially , respectively .",
    "the total h i image and intensity weighted velocity field are shown in fig .",
    "[ contvels ] .",
    "we calculate a total h i mass of m@xmath10 m@xmath11 .",
    "there is an angle of 90@xmath12 between the central stellar disk and the polar h i disk , which warps at a distance of 20 kpc to 77@xmath12 .    a comparison of slices through the data cube in position - velocity along the major axis of the h i disk compared to the major axis of the central stellar disk ( fig .",
    "[ posvel ] ) clearly demonstrate that the regular rotation within this misaligned gas disk is completely decoupled from the stellar component .",
    "the major axis slice ( left panel , fig . [ posvel ] ) confirms the notion from the velocity field that the h i is a disk and not a ring .",
    "the rotation curve increases non - linearly with increasing radius and appears to flatten out at a radius of about 30 , or 11 kpc .",
    "the rotation at the last measured point ( about 22 kpc ) is 100 km s@xmath2 ( assuming an inclination of 40@xmath13 derived from a best fit of the velocity field ) .",
    "this implies a dynamical mass of 5 x 10@xmath14 m@xmath11 within 22 kpc .",
    "the sdss @xmath15 value of 6.6@xmath3 gives a radius of 2.4 kpc , so the extent of the h i gas is about 9 times the extent of the perpendicular stellar disk .",
    "the inverse concentration index for sdss galaxies , taken from the ratio of @xmath16 to @xmath15 , correlates tightly with morphological type @xcite , and in our central , stellar galaxy is consistent with an exponential , rotationally supported disk .",
    "analysis of the optical spectra available from sdss allows an approximate measure of the stellar mass in the central galaxy .",
    "the parameters are calculated by yip et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) who utilizes the spectrum services provided by @xcite , and the stellar population model by @xcite to find a mass of @xmath17 for the part of our galaxy falling within the 3  fiber .",
    "this provides a lower limit for the stellar mass of the entire galaxy .",
    "since this area is roughly half the optical extent of our tiny galaxy , we expect the total stellar mass to be twice that , roughly equal to the h i mass in the polar disk .",
    "this is similar to the polar disk simulated by @xcite which had a baryonic mass in the polar ring of only a third the mass of the central s0 galaxy , and ngc 4650a which has twice the mass in gas and stars in its polar disk as in the central host galaxy @xcite .",

    ". a cursory look at 18 other polar ring galaxies taken from @xcite which are contained within the sdss redshift survey finds them in average or slightly overdense environments ( platen , private communication ) .",
    "this is consistent with a photometric statistical study by of the visible environments of 56 polar ring galaxies , which found them to be similar to normal galaxies .",
    "the two voids and their dividing wall were identified with the closely related watershed void finder ( wvf , @xcite ) and cosmic spine formalism @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the delaunay tessellation field estimator reconstructed density field inferred from the local sdss galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "the wvf identifies the voids and traces their spatial outline , the cosmic spine formalism recovers the wall forming the boundary between the two voids .    following its identification",
    ", we determine the geometry , shape and orientation of the wall .",
    "these are inferred from the principal components of the covariance matrix @xmath18 , computed on the basis of the 34 sdss galaxies within a distance of @xmath19 mpc around the void galaxy .",
    "the wall s flattening is estimated from the ratio of its smallest eigenvalue , @xmath20 , over the other two eigenvalues @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the obtained thickness of the wall , @xmath23 mpc , corresponds to a flattening of @xmath24 .",

    "these maps are created using galaxy redshifts from sdss dr6 , which is limited to galaxies with @xmath25 magnitudes and 55separation from any neighbors .",
    "the polar disk is at an angle of @xmath26 from the normal of the wall , and the central stellar disk is similarly misaligned @xmath26 away from the plane of the wall .",
    "roughly , however , the polar disk appears more perpendicular to the wall than aligned .     out to 10 mpc has been plotted , with concentric circles every 2 mpc in the plane of the wall .",
    "this demonstrates the loneliness of our galaxy and the emptiness of the bounding voids .",

    "with our data we can probe in h i an area of 650 kpc @xmath27 650 kpc on the plane of the sky surrounding sdss j102819.24 + 623502.6 , with a velocity range from 4232 km s@xmath2 to 6196 km s@xmath2 . despite the significant volume probed ,",
    "no companions are detected above the @xmath28 limit in h i. down to the sdss limits , the neighborhood surrounding our lonely galaxy is empty within 3.5 mpc .",
    "this environmental isolation makes it unlikely that the substantial @xmath29 of neutral hydrogen we detect was accreted through a merger or close encounter , and we propose cold accretion as the most likely mechanism @xcite .",
    "furthermore , satellite mergers are generally accompanied by a burst of star formation and the addition of existing stars to the system , neither of which are seen .",
    "we do see nuv emission in the stellar disk ( fig .",
    "[ galex ] ) , indicating star formation occurred there within the recent past , however the lack of uv or optical emission in the polar disk is convincing .",
    "perhaps we are observing this system in the earliest stage of its development , where the slowly accreted gas has not yet cooled sufficiently to begin forming stars .",
    "the measured column density never passes above the @xmath30 @xmath6 surface density threshold proposed by @xcite even without correcting for inclination , leading us to expect little to no star formation in our extended disk .",
    "slow accretion has been proposed as a formation mechanism for the optically discovered , h i rich polar disk galaxy ngc 4650a @xcite . while tidal accretion simulations by can reproduce massive , gas - rich and star - poor polar rings , note that such a encounters would convert the central galaxy into an elliptical remnant , and not the rotationally supported disk found in ngc 4650a and suggested in our system .",
    "cold flow accretion as a formation mechanism of polar disks has also been  observed \" serendipitously in two simulations .",
    "@xcite discovered a polar disk galaxy that formed in their simulation area through the infall of cold gas along a 1 mpc long filament .",
    "@xcite found that their cosmological simulation contained a polar disk galaxy that was stable over timescales of 3 - 5 gyr . in both cases , comparisons of the simulated galaxies with observations",
    "produce amazing optical and dynamical similarities .",
    "the orientation of the central stellar disk @xmath26 from the wall is surprising .",
    "recent observational and simulation results @xcite show that disk galaxies statistically align their spin axis to lie within the wall they are embedded in .",
    "such an alignment would then naturally lend itself to accretion of material within the plane of the wall , forming a polar disk .",
    "this , however , is not what we see , and instead the accreted material appears to be falling in out of the voids .",
    "what we may witness reflects the process of a hierarchically evolving void population @xcite .",
    "as voids expand and evacuate matter from their interior , they tend to merge with neighboring voids into ever larger underdensities .",
    "the heuristic simulation of @xcite illustrates how a group of spherical voids , embedded within a larger underdense area , expand until they meet .",
    "once they touch , matter at the sheetlike boundaries of the voids starts to stream along these interstices towards the emerging higher density boundary surrounding the entire complex of merging voids ( see fig .",
    "[ velgrad ] ) . as a result",
    "we observe the thinning and dissolution of the intervoid walls while they get gradually integrated in the emerging larger - scale void and remain visible as its tenuous interior substructure .",
    "the position of our galaxy within its wall is reminiscent of this situation , supporting the idea that the polar gas is not falling in from the wall , as that material is instead streaming away , but out of the bounding voids .",
