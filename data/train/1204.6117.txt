    "each methodology has its own advantage and disadvantage . among others ,",
    "weak lensing technique is unique in the sense that it identifies clusters by searching for high peaks in the weak lensing mass map , and thus does not rely on physical state of the baryonic component @xcite .",
    "therefore , combining weak lensing cluster sample with samples selected by another method is beneficial not only for various cosmological applications but also for better understanding of cluster physics .",
    "recently @xcite reported 301 weak lensing high peaks located from 64  deg@xmath4 data . among those peaks , they confirmed 85 groups / clusters , which is the largest weak lensing cluster samples constructed to date ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "currently the size of weak lensing selected cluster sample is mainly limited by areas of optical imaging surveys .",
    "however , the situation is changing drastically in coming decade because there are several ongoing or planned wide field deep optical surveys including dark energy survey[multiblock footnote omitted ] , the kilo - degree survey , hyper suprime - cam[multiblock footnote omitted ] , and large synoptic survey telescope[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "thus in the near future , weak lensing selected cluster catalogues containing @xmath5 clusters will be available .",
    "it is therefore important to examine the selection function of the weak lensing selected cluster samples in order to take full advantage of these unique cluster catalogues .",
    "the standard method for identifying clusters with weak lensing is to search for high peaks in the weak lensing mass map generated from weak lensing shear data with a carefully designed smoothing filter .",
    "peaks above a given threshold are selected as cluster candidates .",
    "the peak height , which plays a central role in this study , is primarily determined by the mass and redshift of the dark matter halo of clusters ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is also affected by the following three effects .",
    "the first is the noise arising from intrinsic shapes of source galaxies used for weak lensing shear measurements ( galaxy shape noise ) .",
    "the second is the projection of structures along the line - of - sight .",
    "the third is the diversity of dark matter distributions in individual haloes .",
    "these effects are important in the sense that they induce the scatter and bias in the peak heights and hence in the resulting weak lensing selected cluster sample .",
    "while these effects were examined in literature to some extent @xcite , we revisit this problem with a particular emphasis on the scatter and bias produced by the diversity of dark matter distributions , using both analytic and numerical approaches .",
    "the matter content of clusters is dominated by dark matter , which accounts for @xmath6 per cent of the mass of the universe .",
    "the dark matter distribution within dark matter haloes are investigated in detail using @xmath7-body simulations , which found that the radial profile of the dark matter halo is accurately described by an analytic form , the so - called nfw profile @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the matter distribution of haloes is characterized by two parameters , the mass and the concentration parameter . while it is known that there is a mean relationship between the mass and concentration parameter , the relation involves a large scatter among different haloes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the weak lensing peak height is sensitive to the halo concentration .",
    "another important prediction of the current standard structure formation model is that the dark matter distribution in clusters is not spherically symmetric but is highly elongated @xcite .",
    "this non - sphericity of the dark matter distribution is known to have large impact on weak lensing measurements of clusters @xcite .",
    "thus even the same mass haloes at the same redshift can produce largely different peak heights depending on the halo concentration and non - sphericity .",
    "this is exactly what we explore in this paper using a large set of mock data generated from gravitational lensing ray - tracing in @xmath7-body simulations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",

    "[ sec : results ] we investigate the scatter and bias in the weak lensing selected clusters , paying special attention to the influence of halo shape .",
    "we briefly compare the peak number count derived from the numerical mock data with our weak lensing analysis results of subaru / suprime - cam observations in section  [ sec : scam ] .",
    "finally , summary and discussion are given in section  [ sec : summary ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the cosmological model with the matter density @xmath8 , baryon density @xmath9 , cosmological constant @xmath10 , spectral index @xmath11 , the normalization of the matter fluctuation @xmath12 , and the hubble parameter @xmath13 , which are the best - fit cosmological parameters in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) third - year results @xcite .",

    "it is customary to re - characterizes it by related parameters , the halo mass and the concentration parameter , which we define below .",
    "the mass of haloes is not a uniquely defined quantity .",
    "one needs to choose proper definitions of masses depending on the purposes @xcite . in theoretical and observations studies , the virial mass @xmath17 , which is defined such that the average density within the virial radius becomes equal to the nonlinear overdensity @xmath18 computed using the spherical collapse model ( see , e.g. , *",

    ", we generate a catalogue of haloes according to the mass function as well as axis ratio distributions of @xcite , and project each halo along random direction to compute the lensing properties .",
    "this allows us to generate a mock catalogue of weak lensing selected clusters based on the triaxial halo model .",
    "here we summarize equations for weak lensing cluster finding which are directly relevant to the following analyses . for more detailed descriptions , see @xcite .",
    "let us first defined the weak lensing mass map which is the smoothed lensing convergence field ( @xmath36 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the filter function to be specified below .",

    "note that this is equivalent to set @xmath38 a finite compensated filter ; that is , @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",

    "we take @xmath67 , which is the value also adopted in @xcite , and @xmath68 .",
    "the others filters have the following functional form , consisting of the power - law with outer exponential - cutoff , @xmath69 we consider two cases : @xmath70 and @xmath71 which we call pex0 and pex1 , respectively . the former mimics the filter function proposed by @xcite designed for maximizing the @xmath2 of weak lensing peak by the nfw halo relative to noises coming from galaxy shape and cosmic structures , whereas the latter mimics the one proposed by @xcite which has a similar shape at the outer region but has less power on the inner region for suppressing the galaxy shape noise .",

    "it is seen from bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1.ps ] that the most of the contribution to @xmath79 comes from the matter within the scale radius or from shear data on scales @xmath80 .",
    "we denote the @xmath2 expected from nfw halo by @xmath81 .",
    "the expected @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2.ps ] as a function of the concentration parameter .",
    "we find that , in the cases of lower @xmath27 , the @xmath2 is sensitive to the concentration parameter ( the same argument but for the case of @xmath17 was made by @xcite ) .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the lensing @xmath2 mostly comes from the mass at the inner region of the halo as was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1.ps ] . the change in the concentration parameter results in the change in the mass of the inner region , and thus results in the change in the @xmath2 . on the other hand , in the cases of higher @xmath27",
    ", the spherical overdensity mass effectively defines the mass of inner region ; therefore , the change in the concentration parameter does not affect the @xmath2 , though it alters the virial mass .",
    "therefore we can argue that the peak @xmath2 is not a good virial mass indicator but more tightly correlates with the inner mass such as @xmath0 .",
    "the result appears to be consistent with the finding of @xcite , who argued that weak lensing mass measurement errors are smaller for larger overdensities of @xmath82 than the case for the virial overdensity .",

    ", we consider a single source redshift of @xmath59 , which is a typical mean source redshift of weak lensing analysis .",
    "note that if redshift information on the source galaxies , e.g. from photometric redshift , is available , one may employ the topographic technique which improves the capability of weak lensing cluster identification @xcite . instead of using 1000 ray - tracing realizations generated by @xcite , we regenerated 200 independent realizations so that the same halo does not appear in different realizations .",
    "weak lensing mass maps , @xmath61 , are generated from lensing shear data by applying the operation eq .",
    "( [ eq : shear2kap ] ) on grid points of @xmath86 with the grid spacing of 0.15  arcmin .",
    "we generated two types of mass maps , one is maps without the galaxy shape noise , and the other is maps with the galaxy shape noise .",
    "for galaxy shape noise , random ellipticities drawn from the truncated two - dimensional gaussian ( see below ) are added to shear data : @xmath87 with @xmath53 and assumed number density of source galaxies of 30  arcmin@xmath88 .",
    "peaks are identified as pixels that have higher values of @xmath89 than 8 surrounding pixels . here",
    "it should be noted that in the case of the noise added maps , especially for the case of the pex0 filter , crowds of high peaks caused by the galaxy shape noise tends to form at massive cluster regions .",
    "to exclude duplicated detections in each cluster , we apply friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with the linking length of 1  arcmin @xcite , and group together duplicated peaks as a single peak .",
    "this procedure generates a catalogue of lensing peaks for each map .      for each @xmath7-body output , we identify dark matter haloes using the standard fof algorithm with the linking parameter of @xmath90 and derive a halo mass @xmath91 for each halo .",
    "we define the halo position by the potential minimum of haloes where the gravitational potential is computed from only fof member particles .",
    "in addition to @xmath91 , we compute the spherical overdensity mass with average overdensities of @xmath92 and 1000 , which are denoted by @xmath93 and @xmath0 , respectively .    to evaluate the halo shape , we compute the inertia tensor of the mass distribution : @xmath94 where @xmath95 run from 1 to 3 , @xmath96 is the number of fof member particles of haloes and @xmath97 denotes the cluster centre defined by the potential minimum .",
    "we use the trace of the inertia tensor to estimate the concentration of the halo mass distribution , @xmath98 this is compared with the expected value for the uniform overdens sphere : @xmath99 to evaluate the triaxility of halo shape , we compute the eigenvectors from the inertia tensor and convert them to the axial ratios @xmath34 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .",

    "we also find that @xmath104-@xmath108 relationships not only have larger scatters but also show some offset in the mean relationship .",
    "one of the reasons may be the mismatch between @xmath91 computed in @xmath7-body simulations and @xmath17 defined by overdensity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presumably caused by the presence of outer substructures that contribute to the fof mass . in the analysis above , the mass maps generated from the gaussian filter are used though the results are found not to be affected by choice of the filter .     and @xmath108 as a function of @xmath106 .",

    "[ fig4.ps],width=309 ]    next we examine the influence of the following three effects on the peak @xmath2 ; ( 1 ) the galaxy shape noise , i.e. , the noise due to the intrinsic shapes of source galaxies used for weak lensing analysis , ( 2 ) the projection of structures along the line of sight of clusters , which we call _ the cosmic noise _ , and ( 3 ) the diversity of dark matter distributions of haloes , which we call _ the halo shape effect_. to do so , the mass maps generated from the gaussian filter are used though the results are found not to be strongly dependent on the choice of the filter . with our choice of parameters for the galaxy shape noise ( e.g. , @xmath53 and @xmath125  arcmin@xmath88 ) , the rms of the galaxy shape noise is @xmath126 , which should act as the additive noise in @xmath108 . the analytic way to estimate the cosmic noise was developed by @xcite under the assumption that the halo and the large - scale structures are uncorrelated , and for the cosmological model adopted in this paper and the gaussian window function , its rms is estimated to be @xmath127 , which should again act as the additive noise .",

    "we evaluate scatters in @xmath131 relations as a function of @xmath106 , and results are plotted in fig .",

    "the result for the noise - free @xmath89 map case shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4.ps ] indicates that the rms increase with @xmath106 . since only the cosmic noise and halo shape effect are playing in this shape noise free case , and the cosmic noise should be independent of the @xmath2 , the dependence of the rms on @xmath106 is most likely originated from the halo shape effect .",
    "we estimate from the rms measured from @xmath131 relationship and the expectation value of @xmath132 ( thus @xmath133 ) that the rms of the halo shape effect scales approximately @xmath134 ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) .",
    "thus for very massive haloes the halo shape effects can be larger than the other noises ( the qualitatively same argument was made by @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig7.ps],width=309 ]    given the strong dependence of the peak heights on the halo orientation , we shall now investigate its impact on weak lensing selected cluster catalogues . in fig .",
    "[ fig6.ps ] , we show the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the halo orientation with respect to the line - of - sight direction , @xmath141 , for haloes with peak heights above the threshold value @xmath144 . here",
    "we include only haloes at @xmath110 for simplicity .",
    "different histograms are for different causes ; nfw - corresponding peaks ( dashed ) , peak heights measured from the noise - free @xmath89 map ( long - dashed ) , and the noise added map ( solid ) . in addition , the same pdf computed with analytic triaxial halo model ( see section  [ sec : halo - theory ] ) is also plotted by the dotted line , which should be compared with the noise - free case because the galaxy shape noise is not added in the triaxial model calculation .",
    "the pdf for the nfw - corresponding peaks ( @xmath106 ) is flat .",
    "this is exactly expected because the nfw - corresponding peak heights are computed from @xmath0 assuming the spherical nfw profile , and hence they should not depend on the orientations of haloes . on the other hand , the pdfs for the measured peaks",
    "are significantly skewed such that the major axes of haloes are preferentially aligned with the line - of - sight direction . to quantify the bias",
    ", we introduce an estimator defined by the ratio between the numbers of haloes with the major axis aligned to the line - of - sight direction ( @xmath145 ) and anti - aligned ( @xmath147 ) , i.e. , @xmath148 and 1.4 for the noise - free and noise added cases , respectively . for the case of the nfw - corresponding peaks we have @xmath149 , suggesting that the error in the above estimation is less than 10 per cent .",
    "in addition , we examine the bias as a function of the peak heights using the estimator , @xmath150 .",
    "while the statistic is not very good especially for higher @xmath2 bins because of a limited number of peaks , one can clearly see a trend that the orientation bias is larger for higher @xmath2 .",
    "this is presumably because the halo shape effect is multiplicative to the @xmath2 .",
    "although the results are not accurate enough to make precise predictions , we find that the bias is @xmath151 for high @xmath2 peaks of @xmath152 . and @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "therefore the orientation bias is one of the most significant selection bias in weak lensing selected cluster catalogues .",
    "its impact on cluster related sciences should be taken into consideration .",
    "the results shown in figs .  [ fig5.ps ] , [ fig6.ps ] , and [ fig7.ps ] indicates that the analytic triaxial model predictions are in very good agreement with the trends found in ray - tracing simulations .",
    "this confirms that the orientation bias comes from the intrinsic triaxial shapes of haloes , rather than the effect of surrounding matter around clusters , because such correlated matter is not included in our analytic triaxial model calculations .",
    "we note that the strong halo orientation bias was also found in previous strong lensing studies as well .",
    "@xcite used a large set of ray - tracing simulations to show that major axes of clusters producing giant arcs are preferentially aligned with the line - of - sight direction , with the level of the bias similar to what found in this paper .",
    "@xcite reported that clusters having larger einstein radii have larger orientation bias , based on the triaixl halo model .",
    "similar result for strong lensing clusters was obtained also by @xcite .",
    "our result indicates that similar orientation bias exists for weak lensing selected clusters as well .        to see the impact of the halo orientation bias",
    ", we examine the _ completeness _ which we define by the fraction of haloes identified as high peaks above a given threshold ( @xmath155 ) in the @xmath89 map relative to all the haloes , namely , @xmath156 .",
    "the choice of the threshold is arbitrary , usually it is chosen considering the trade - off between the sample size and the fraction of the false positives ( see section  [ sec : peakcounts ] ) .",
    "here we adopt @xmath157 .",
    "the completeness for different filters are shown in left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig8.ps ] .",
    "we find that the pex0 filter is the best in terms of the completeness , although the difference between filters is small , 10 per cent at most .",
    "right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig8.ps ] compares the completeness for haloes with @xmath145 ( red histogram ) with the others ( blue ) , where the @xmath89 maps with pex0 filter are used .",
    "we find that the effect of the halo orientation bias is visible for the intermediate mass haloes for which @xmath158 .",
    "the reason is that for the very massive / small haloes , the @xmath2 differs very much from @xmath159 , meaning that the spread of @xmath160 produced by the halo shape effect does not affect the detectability of those haloes .",
    "thus the completeness of haloes with @xmath161 are mostly affected by the halo orientation bias .",
    "the difference of the amplitude for the completeness is about 20 per cent for those haloes .",
    "weak lensing @xmath89 are computed from galaxy ellipticity ( after the psf correction ) data with three filters under consideration on regular grid points with a grid spacing of 0.15  arcmin .",
    "we then identify high peaks from the @xmath89 maps .",
    "peaks located within 1  arcmin from the field boundary were discarded because such regions are likely affected by the partial lack of data .",
    "the total area used for the peak finding is 4  deg@xmath4 .",
    "we detect 14 , 9 and 7 peaks with @xmath162 for the pex0 , pex1 and gaussian filter , respectively .",
    "high peaks with @xmath162 are summarized in table [ table : peaks ] , and peak counts are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig11.ps ] , in which a good agreement with mock simulation data is found . in figs .",
    "[ fig : a1]-[fig : a4 ] , @xmath89 maps generated with the pex0 filter are shown in which high peaks are marked with circles .",
    "we also mark known clusters taken from a compilation by nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) by the plus symbols .",
    "it is seen that many but not all high peaks are associated with known clusters .",
    "it should be noted that the known cluster sample plotted in the figures is just a compilation of many individual cluster catalogues identified by many different techniques , and thus is not homogeneous even over a single field ."
