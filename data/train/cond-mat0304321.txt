    "<S> recent progress in the large scale mapping of social networks is opening new quantitative windows into the structure of human societies . </S>",
    "<S> these networks are largely the result of how we access and utilize information . here </S>",
    "<S> i show that a universal decision mechanism , where we base our choices on the actions of others , can explain much of their structure . </S>",
    "<S> such collective social arrangements emerge from successful strategies to handle information flow at the individual level . </S>",
    "<S> they include the formation of closely - knit communities and the emergence of well - connected individuals . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can command the following of others while only exercising ordinary judgment .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.1 cm    in recent years there has been growing interest in the quantitative structure of human societies . it has emerged that we are part of heterogeneous networks or graphs @xcite , sets of links that connect each one of us to all our acquaintances . </S>",
    "<S> not all people are alike : some live almost isolated , most belong to distinguishable communities @xcite and a small fraction of the population is made up of exceptionally well connected individuals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> social networks have the remarkable property that one can reach anyone else through a very small number of connections - the famous six degrees of separation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these findings beg important questions : why are social networks invariably clustered in communities ? why are there individuals with such different connectivity </S>",
    "<S> ? answering these puzzles requires tying the morphology of social networks to their function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar problems occur in the study of other complex networks , for example , dealing with gene and protein - protein interactions @xcite , metabolism @xcite , ecosystems @xcite ( foodwebs ) and neural activity . </S>",
    "<S> thus understanding the simultaneous robustness and adaptability of these complex systems in the light of their function is a general problem at the forefront of the current scientific agenda across many disciplines @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty of this approach consists in defining the function of each of these complex networks in a way that captures their essence and simultaneously permits quantitative progress . </S>",
    "<S> clearly many details of social behavior , in particular , appear too rich and our understanding of them remains too qualitative to fall in this class . </S>",
    "<S> there are however important well documented exceptions .    </S>",
    "<S> a familiar situation is having to choose between seemingly equivalent options , at least given the amount of information and time at our disposal @xcite . in practice many of our decisions fall in this class . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a degeneracy of choice , typical also of situations when relevant information is difficult to discriminate from too much noise , or when it can not be trusted . in these situations we often rely on the observation of the actions of others we know as the basis for our decisions @xcite </S>",
    "<S> this strategy has two important advantages : we can be sure not to do worse than most of the people we know and , in addition , we may actually join a winning trend early and profit from it .    </S>",
    "<S> recently this type of discriminating imitation has become the focus of an extensive empirical literature in economy @xcite and the social sciences . </S>",
    "<S> bikhchandani , hirshleifer and welch @xcite collected a vast amount of empirical evidence that establishes the universal importance of the choices of others in influencing our own and were able to model this phenomenon in simple terms . </S>",
    "<S> they dubbed the formation of the trend or fad that often results an information cascade ; a process whereby sequential individual choices propagate a piece of information through the entire population @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is also often liked ( qualitatively ) to the spread of an epidemic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , information cascades lead to the spontaneous formation of large consensus where there are a priori no individual preferences .    </S>",
    "<S> here i use an implementation of these ideas @xcite consisting of a population of @xmath0 agents , facing a choice among @xmath1 labels . at each time </S>",
    "<S> step individuals compare the relative growth rate of their label to that of one of their immediate acquaintances , chosen at random . </S>",
    "<S> if the latter s growth rate ( the trend s relative momentum ) is greater the agent switches to his neighbor s trend ; otherwise he keeps his . </S>",
    "<S> the model has one additional ingredient : if a trend slows down individuals may decide to take a risk in something new ( an empty label ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is modeled by @xmath2 , the relative growth rate below which non - conformism sets in . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath3 , which results in population wide trends or cascades @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> references to other related dynamical implementations @xcite ( including models of herding ) and additional discussion are given elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> typical dynamics @xcite are characterized by cycles alternating population disorder , when many different trends coexist , and order , when most of the population falls into the same label . </S>",
    "<S> both collective states of order and disorder are dynamically unstable making the evolution very sensitive to chance events @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> it becomes very difficult in practice for an external observer to profit from the reckoning that agents are following trends , especially when the number of choices becomes large .    to explore the effects of the underlying network morphology on the dynamics </S>",
    "<S> i generate ( binary ) artificial social networks as small world graphs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are random graphs with clustering : @xmath0 individuals are represented as nodes , each with an average number of connections @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> clustering is produced by dividing the population into communities , each characterized by an average higher degree of internal connections per node @xmath5 than external @xmath6 connections ( @xmath7 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to measure correlations between parts of the population it is useful to define a label state vector @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the number of individuals in label @xmath10 belonging to group @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the natural inner product @xmath12 is a ( positive definite ) measure of the correlation between different groups , see fig.[fig1 ] </S>",
    "<S> .    0.5 cm    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the correlation between several subsets of the population , within a community , between two distinct communities and for a control set of individuals with random connections . </S>",
    "<S> it is now clear why it is a good defensive strategy to belong to a tightly knit collective : communities are _ islands of information coherence_. thanks to the large redundancy of personal connections inside the community the coherence of local information is preserved over time and personal deviations inside the group are small compared to those to the outside . </S>",
    "<S> this remains true even if a few individuals or connections are lost .    </S>",
    "<S> comforting as it may be to keep up with our neighbors it may actually be better to be a step ahead . as we discussed above this </S>",
    "<S> is a tall order , even if one is fully informed of the state of the whole population . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ] shows the success rate of several criteria attempting to predict the emerging new trend at the particularly important time when a former dominant movement collapses , i.e. when it becomes as large as the largest secondary trend . </S>",
    "<S> all criteria based on the full knowledge of the state of population at this particular time ( the largest secondary trend , the fastest growing one or the trend with the largest product of momentum and size ) are far from good and become very poor for large number of competing choices l.    0.5 cm    interestingly there is a simple alternative solution - it relies on connections , not reasoning or information . </S>",
    "<S> i examine this scenario by introducing a new well - connected individual into the population , a network hub , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the hub bases his decisions , like any other agent , on the state of an average number of other individuals @xmath4 , but his choices can be seen by everybody else . </S>",
    "<S> what is particular about the evolution is illustrated in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] : the hub is exceptionally good at picking the next winning trend early , before it becomes dominant - the perfect winning strategy .    1 cm    however the hub is , by construction , neither better informed nor animated by superior decision making . </S>",
    "<S> this apparent paradox is easily dispelled : the hub s actions are very visible to others . </S>",
    "<S> any reasonable decision on his part ( the adoption of any growing label ) has a large probability of being immediately followed by many ( @xmath13 , at the next iteration ) and thus to _ make _ the winning trend . </S>",
    "<S> this property is independent of the underlying community structure and is enhanced for larger populations ( larger @xmath0 ) , as long as @xmath14 is such that @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is popularity , not knowledge or reasoning , that leads to the most successful strategy in an environment characterized by strong choice degeneracy .    given some memory the hub s successes reinforce his position and ( apparent ) foresight . </S>",
    "<S> each correct prediction encourages others to heed his choices and follow at the next opportunity . </S>",
    "<S> this reinforces the hub s popularity , allowing him to pick the next winning trend with greater certainty and so on : the process is self - reinforcing . </S>",
    "<S> it also naturally leads to a specific form of preferential attachment @xcite , where the most connected node - the best trend predictor - is preferred . </S>",
    "<S> thus , under choice degeneracy , one should expect the appearance of well - connected , very visible individuals as a social network evolves .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm    nodes with an exceptionally large connectivity are a common property of other complex networks , including scale - free graphs @xcite describing e.g. www , power - grids and the large scale features of protein - protein interactions _ in vivo_. it has been pointed @xcite out that such networks utmost fragility is due to the loss of these key nodes . </S>",
    "<S> trend dynamics shows how this fragility may only be apparent in social networks . </S>",
    "<S> the hub is a common node , only its degree of outgoing connections is exceptionally large . </S>",
    "<S> i argued above that there is a fundamental instability for a common individual to be promoted to this position . </S>",
    "<S> because social connections are rearranged on much faster time scales than nodes @xcite , upon loss of a hub a new one can quickly develop from another node and the structural integrity of the network will be preserved after a short transient . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the addition of a second well - connected node dealing with the same information reduces the predictability of emerging trends , unless the two hubs work in tandem ( as would happen under specific assortative mixing @xcite ) and so forth . </S>",
    "<S> it is however perfectly natural for separate hubs to coexist if they relate to different social dimensions @xcite , i.e. if they deal with different types of information . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the large scale structure of human societies , when averaged over time and social dimensions may be characterized by many hubs with varying reaches and interdependencies . </S>",
    "<S> these properties may lead to the emergence of interesting scale - invariances in large social networks associated with decision making and information flow .    observing the actions of others </S>",
    "<S> is a universal simple mechanism that allows us to handle imperfect information in our complex social environment to make difficult decisions . </S>",
    "<S> we can protect ourselves from the tyranny of fashions by associating into tightly knit communities or we may try to set trends by influencing the choices of others through our social connections . here </S>",
    "<S> i showed that these successful individual strategies lead to stable social arrangements , which coincide with some of the most notable observed structures of social networks . </S>",
    "<S> trend dynamics breaks the degeneracy of our individual choices and leads to the spontaneous formation of collective movements . </S>",
    "<S> whenever concerted social action is more productive than the sum of individual efforts social hubs may become the social mechanism that facilitates the creation of consensus most promptly and predictably . </S>"
