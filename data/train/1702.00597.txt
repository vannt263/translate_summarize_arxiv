    "extreme mass ratio inspiral ( emri ) gravitational wave ( gw ) emission events , where a stellar mass black hole ( bh ) of mass @xmath0 gradually inspirals into a massive bh ( mbh ) of mass @xmath1 , are one of the main classes of anticipated extra - galactic low - frequency gw sources .",
    "since @xmath2 , such bhs probe spacetime near the mbh almost as test particles , and thereby offer an opportunity to test general relativity ( gr ) under theoretically favorable conditions .",
    "however , the inspiral process is not simply a 2-body problem in the strong gravity regime .",
    "the mbh is surrounded by @xmath3 background stars inside its radius of dynamical influence @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy s spheroidal .",
    "the complex dynamics of the stellar cluster around the mbh , that supplies stars that fall into the mbh , whether directly on plunging orbits , or indirectly on inspiraling ones , also interferes with the idealized 2-body motion of the light bh relative to the mbh , and can even suppress inspiral altogether .",
    "i show here that emris are in fact possible by virtue of a three - way fortunate coincidence between the magnitude and timescale of collective newtonian effects due to the background stars , which give rise to strong resonant gravitational torques , and those of the leading - order precessional and radiative post - newtonian ( pn ) terms of gr @xcite .",
    "this curious coincidence raises several questions : how fine - tuned is it ? is this a specific feature of einstein s gr , or is it generic to a larger class of theories of strong gravity ?",
    "do still - viable alternatives to gr predict substantially different plunge / inspiral branching ratios ? could the very detection of an emri in the future rule out some of them ?",
    "these questions remain open at this time .",
    "another consequence of the fortunate coincidence is that rapid relaxation by resonant torques in the symmetric potential near a mbh @xcite , which can dominate slow 2-body relaxation in some regions of phase space @xcite , is ultimately not very important in determining the steady - state loss - rates ( e.g. by tidal disruption or gw inspiral ) . by a coincidence that can only be understood in the context of the relativistic loss - cone dynamics , early naive estimates that included only a partial treatment of newtonian dynamics (",
    "2-body relaxation , but not resonant torques ) and of gr dynamics ( gw dissipation but not in - plane schwarzschild precession ) , yielded correct order of magnitude loss - rates estimates @xcite .",
    "here i briefly review the recent developments in the understanding and modeling of the relativistic loss - cone that lead to these insights , focusing on the relevance for emri rates , and on the prospects of probing these dynamical mechanisms locally , near the milky way s mbh @xmath6 .",
    "orbits whose periapse lies inside the tidal radius @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the stellar radius ) or inside the last stable orbit @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 are classified as plunges . in terms of the normalized angular momentum @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the orbital semimajor axis ( sma ) and @xmath13 the eccentricity ) , the corresponding plunge conditions are @xmath14 or @xmath15 . since the set of velocity vectors that take a star from position @xmath16 to the mbh span a cone , the set of such orbits are called the loss - cone .",
    "stars in the loss - cone are destroyed in less than an orbital period . in steady state",
    ", new stars have to be deflected to loss - cone orbits , and therefore the loss - cone problem is the problem of how a stellar system around a mbh randomizes . in a spherical potential , where the angular momentum of individual orbits is conserved in collisionless motion",
    ", randomization is achieved by dynamical relaxation .",
    "the classical treatments of the loss - cone problem considered only slow 2-body relaxation ( denoted here also non - resonant relaxation , nr ) , which is inherent to any system composed of discrete interacting particles @xcite .",
    "a relaxed stellar system around a mbh settles into a high density powerlaw stellar cusp , @xmath17 . for a single mass population , which we consider here for simplicity , @xmath18 @xcite . near a mbh",
    ", the 2-body relaxation timescale can be expressed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the orbital period , @xmath21 is the number of stars with sma @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the coulomb factor @xcite .",
    "generally , the 2-body relaxation timescale for changing the angular momentum @xmath24 by order of itself , @xmath25 , is related to the relaxation timescale for changing the energy @xmath26 by order of itself , @xmath27 , by @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore faster to reach the mbh by relaxation of angular momentum than by relaxation of energy ( equivalently , relaxation of the sma , since @xmath29 , using the stellar dynamical convention @xmath30 for bound orbits ) .    in the presence of orbital dissipation ( e.g. by the emission of gws , by tidal deformations of the star close to the mbh , or by hydrodynamical interactions with a massive accretion disk )",
    ", the star can also fall into the mbh by gradually loosing orbital energy .",
    "such orbits are classified as inspirals . because inspiral , unlike a plunge , requires many consecutive periapse passages , such orbits are much more susceptible to perturbations by the stellar background , unless the inspiral already starts from a tight orbit around the mbh .",
    "phase space is therefore separated into two regimes ( fig .",
    "[ f : ej ] ) .",
    "close to the mbh , below some critical sma @xmath31 ( here we consider only dissipation by gws ) , stars are statistically much more likely to reach the mbh by inspiral , whereas above @xmath31 and up to @xmath32 , plunges are much more likely .",
    "the transition is sharp @xcite .",
    "the plunge rate is @xmath33 , while the inspiral rate is @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "since the relaxation timescale is typically not a strong function of distance , the branching ratio @xmath35 reflects the relative number of sources in the small phase space volume interior to @xmath31 and the much larger one inside @xmath36 .",
    "for that reason inspiral events are generally much rarer than plunges , @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the relativistic loss cone in @xmath38 phase space for a simplified model of the milky way ( mw ) nucleus with a @xmath39 mbh surrounded by a relaxed cluster of @xmath40 stellar bhs @xcite .",
    "the gray region to the left , below the last stable orbit ( lso ) line demarcates the region of unstable orbits .",
    "stars diffuse from the galaxy beyond the radius of influence at the top ( @xmath41 ) and either wander back to the galaxy , plunge directly into the mbh across the lso ( the light red track is a monte carlo generated track of a plunge event ) , or diffuse deeper into the cusp until the cross the gw separatrix ( magenta curve ) , where the streamlines of the probability density flux turn over to the region where gw dissipation is faster than 2-body relaxation ( blue curve ) .",
    "the critical sma @xmath31 ( black horizontal lines , at two possible extreme values ) approximately separates phase space into a region @xmath42 where the stellar bhs plunge directly into the mbh , and a small phase space volume at @xmath43 where the bhs inspiral into the mbh .",
    "rr is quenched by fast precession below the ai line ( gray line ) , and the trajectories appear to `` bounce '' against it due to the strong gradient in the effective rr diffusion coefficient ( fig . [",
    "f : aisb ] ) .",
    "rr is faster than nr only in a restricted region of phase space ( yellow region ) , where motion along the @xmath44-direction is much faster than in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "since the rr - dominated region is well - separated from the plunge and emri loss - lines , rr has a only a small effect on the steady state loss - rates ( cf fig .",
    "[ f : rates ] ) .",
    "however , it has a strong effect on the orbits of the observed s - stars , which happen to lie in this phase space region ( sec .",
    "[ ss : sstars ] ) . ]",
    "resonant relaxation @xcite is a form of rapid relaxation of angular momentum that occurs in potentials with a high degree of symmetry , which restrict orbital evolution ( e.g. fixed keplerian ellipses in the newtonian potential of a point mass ; fixed orbital planes in a spherical potential ) .",
    "the approximately spherical , point mass - dominated potential around a mbh is such a potential .",
    "far enough from the mbh where gr effects are small , but close enough to it , where deviations from keplerian motion due to the distributed stellar mass are also small , the orbits are nearly - keplerian ellipses ( for @xmath6 this distance scale corresponds to @xmath45 pc @xcite ) , which persist over a long coherence time @xmath46 . on that timescale , the @xmath47 background stars can be viewed as fixed elliptical mass `` wires '' .",
    "a test star orbiting the mbh with sma @xmath12 in the potential generated by the background , will conserve its energy ( since the wires are stationary ) , but will be subject to a non - zero residual force of order @xmath48 , which translates to a coherent torque @xmath49 .",
    "this torque persists in magnitude and direction over time @xmath50 , until the small deviations from perfect symmetry accumulate and randomize the background .",
    "the change in angular momentum over the coherence time , @xmath51 then becomes the mean free path in @xmath24-space for a random walk on timescale @xmath52 : @xmath53 , where the rr relaxation timescale is @xmath54p^{2}(a)/t_{c}(a)$ ] .    the ratio between the rr and nr relaxation times , @xmath55 reflects the fact that nr occurs by point - point interactions , and is boosted by the closest strong interactions , whereas rr occurs by orbit - orbit interactions , which as extended objects can not approach each other arbitrarily close , but are boosted by the long coherence time .",
    "the relevance of rr to the loss - cone problem is due to the fact that near a mbh , it is possible to have @xmath56 .",
    "this implies very rapid angular momentum evolution , and specifically @xmath57 , which allows strong interactions with the mbh .",
    "the strong rr torques inside @xmath58 , if unquenched , would drive all stars directly into the mbh on plunge orbits and the emri rate would drop to zero .",
    "hopman & alexander conjectured in 2006 @xcite that emris will in fact occur because the pn1 @xmath59 gr precession becomes significant enough to quench rr before the pn2.5 @xmath60 gw dissipation rate becomes fast ( here @xmath61 ) .",
    "this was later confirmed in @xmath62-body simulations @xcite ( but see sec .",
    "[ ss : sb ] ) , and was also demonstrated by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of diffusion in the relativistic loss - cone @xcite ( sec . [",
    "s : etaformalism ] ) . fig .",
    "( [ f : fc ] ) shows that gr schwarzschild precession has a drastic effect on the steady state phase space densities and rates .",
    "emris exist because of a fortunate coincidence in the ranking and phase space dependence of the magnitude of the rr torques , which are a collective newtonian effect , and the magnitudes of gr s leading order precessional and radiative terms , which are post - newtonian 2-body effects .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the complex dynamics that ultimately lead stars and compact remnants to fall into the mbh can be modeled by mc simulations that introduce rr by effective diffusion coefficients that are derived from the @xmath63-formalism .",
    "phase space is clearly separated into a restricted region where rr dominates the dynamics , and a region where ai strongly suppresses rr due to fast precession .",
    "elsewhere , rr exists , but nr is faster .",
    "importantly , both the the loss - lines for plunges ( lso ) and for gw emris lie below the ai locus , and so rr has only a small effect on the loss - rates .",
    "this situation appears to be a fortunate coincidence for the prospects of detecting emris .",
    "it is a result of a three - way competition between rr torques that tend to push stars to plunge orbits , gr schwarzschild precession , which suppresses rr , and gr gw dissipation , which when fast enough , can be completed before the stellar background interferes .",
    "this coincidence appears robust in the context of einstein s gr .",
    "it is however still unclear how general it is in the wider context of theories of strong gravity .",
    "the dynamical processes that play part in emri dynamics can be probed by the puzzling s - stars observed near the mbh of the galactic center , which are at the rr - dominated region of the phase space around @xmath6 .",
