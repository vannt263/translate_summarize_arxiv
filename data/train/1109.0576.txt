    "the mechanism for the breaking of the @xmath9 electroweak gauge symmetry  @xcite of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite has thus far evaded experimental verification even though the sm accommodates current collider data and it has been tested with remarkable precision .",
    "searches for the sm higgs boson at lep  @xcite , the tevatron  @xcite , and the lhc  @xcite have yet to confirm its existence .",
    "the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking may offer a richer phenomenology than expected in the minimal version of the sm .",
    "several higgs bosons may exist , or the higgs boson(s ) may have couplings that are different from those expected in the minimal model . here",
    "we explore the possibility that the lightest higgs scalar does not couple to fermions at tree level , but is in all other ways sm - like . in order to provide masses to the fermions",
    ", additional degrees of freedom must exist in the higgs sector , and models with higgs doublets and triplets are possible  @xcite .",
    "we consider here a model in which all particles and interactions beyond those of the sm have no phenomenological impact for observables at the tevatron aside from suppressing the fermion couplings to the higgs boson .",
    "we call this model the fermiophobic higgs model ( fhm ) . in the following",
    ", we denote the fermiophobic higgs boson @xmath0 , the sm higgs boson @xmath10 , and use the symbol @xmath11 in a context which is valid for both .    in the fhm , the production of higgs bosons at hadron colliders via the process @xmath12",
    "is suppressed to a negligible rate . in the sm , this process proceeds through one - loop intermediaries via fermion couplings to the higgs boson , and at two or more loops via fermion and boson couplings to the higgs boson .",
    "two - loop electroweak processes contribute to @xmath12 production in the fermiophobic higgs model ( fhm ) , but at a vanishingly small rate , as their main contribution in the sm are through interference with one - loop processes  @xcite .",
    "the associated production mechanisms @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as well as the vector - boson - fusion ( vbf ) processes @xmath15 remain nearly unchanged relative to the corresponding processes in the sm .",
    "table  [ tab : fpxsbr ] lists the production rates we use for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and vbf modes .",
    "we neglect the cross section for @xmath12 in this model .",
    "we use the @xmath16 and @xmath17 cross sections from ref .",
    "@xcite , which are based on the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation of v2hv  @xcite and include next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) qcd contributions  @xcite , as well as one - loop electroweak corrections  @xcite .",
    "we use the vbf cross section computed in the sm at nnlo in qcd in ref .",
    "electroweak corrections to the vbf production cross section are computed with the hawk program  @xcite , and are small and negative ( 2 - 3% ) in the higgs boson mass range considered here .",
    "we include these corrections in the vbf cross sections used in this combination of results from the tevatron .",
    "we use the systematic uncertainties on the production cross section predictions from their respective publications , treating the @xmath1 and @xmath2 production cross section uncertainties as fully correlated with each other , and uncorrelated with the vbf production cross section uncertainty .",
    "another consequence of the fhm is to modify the decay branching ratios of the higgs boson with respect to the sm predictions .",
    "direct decays to fermions are forbidden ; decays to fermions can proceed only via loops involving weak gauge bosons , and these are highly suppressed due to a spin flip required in the loop .",
    "the partial width of the higgs boson decay to a pair of gluons , which in the sm is comparable to that of the decay to a pair of charm quarks , is negligibly small in the fhm .",
    "the remaining decays , to @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , account for nearly the entire decay width . for higgs boson masses",
    "below twice the @xmath20 boson mass , @xmath21 , the favored direct decay to @xmath5 is reduced because one or both of the @xmath20 bosons is far from resonance . nonetheless , because the competing decay modes have small partial widths , the branching to @xmath5 is still dominant , particularly for a heavier higgs boson with @xmath22  gev/@xmath8 . the branching fraction @xmath23 )",
    "is greatly enhanced over @xmath24 ) for all @xmath25 , and its clean signature and excellent mass resolution provide most of the search sensitivity for @xmath26  gev/@xmath8 .",
    "table  [ tab : fpxsbr ] lists the decay branching fractions we assume in the searches described below , all of which were computed with hdecay  @xcite .",
    "the dominant uncertainties on the sm higgs branching fractions in the range 100  gev@xmath27  200  gev@xmath28 arise from uncertainties on the @xmath29 quark mass @xmath30 , the charm quark mass @xmath31 , and the strong coupling constant @xmath32  @xcite . because these uncertainties affect only the decay modes in which a fermion ( specifically , a quark ) couples to the higgs boson , they do not affect the higgs boson s branching ratios in the fhm , and therefore they do not contribute to this analysis .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations have searched for the sm higgs boson in @xmath33 decays  @xcite .",
    "these searches can not be directly reinterpreted as constraints on the fhm by simply scaling the cross sections and branching ratios , because the kinematic distributions of the higgs bosons , their decay products , and the particles produced in association with the higgs boson differ between the fhm and the sm .",
    "these differences arise from the absence of @xmath12 production in the fhm , and the increased fraction of the presence of an associated vector boson @xmath20 or @xmath34 , or recoiling quark jets in the case of vbf .",
    "the transverse momentum ( @xmath35 ) spectrum of the higgs boson in the fhm is thus much harder than it is in the sm , affecting the signal acceptance and the ability to separate the signal from the backgrounds .",
    "the @xmath36 analyses have therefore been reoptimized for the fhm , taking advantage of the higher @xmath35 of the higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "these analyses are updates of previous searches for the higgs boson in the fhm using 3.0  fb@xmath7 of data at cdf  @xcite and 2.7  fb@xmath7 of data at d0  @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration has also sought higgs bosons decaying to photon pairs , and sets a lower limit on @xmath37 in the fhm of 112  gev/@xmath8 at the 95% cl  @xcite .",
    "atlas has sought the sm higgs boson in the decay @xmath33 in 1.1 fb@xmath7 of data  @xcite .",
    "the four lep collaborations , aleph , delphi , l3 , and opal , have searched for @xmath38 , and from their combined results report a lower limit on @xmath37 of 108.2  gev/@xmath8 in the fhm at the 95% cl  @xcite .    .",
    "the production cross sections for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and vbf at nnlo also listed are decay branching fractions @xmath39 of the higgs boson in the fermiophobic higgs model computed with hdecay  . [",

    "the shaded bands indicate the @xmath40  standard deviation ( s.d . ) and @xmath41  s.d .",
    "intervals on the distribution of the limits that are expected in the absence of a contribution from the higgs boson .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in summary , we present a combination of cdf and d0 searches for the higgs boson in a model in which the tree - level couplings of the higgs boson to fermions vanish , while retaining standard model couplings to bosons .",
