    "resilience of the real interconnected systems ( such as infrastructural , ecological , and financial systems ) against external perturbations is among the fundamental themes in the understanding of complex systems , especially the phenomena of sharp transitions or tipping points in their structural and also dynamical regimes @xcite .",
    "when it s adopted as a representation of nodes as constituents and edges as interactions among them , the complex network theory @xcite in many cases offers an analytical framework for the resilience problem as a percolation transition @xcite which usually involves an emergence of macroscopic residual subgraph structure against a removal procedure of nodes and edges . typical methods to explore the resilience of networks with undirected interactions",
    "are the shrinkage of the giant connected component against a random node removal @xcite , the @xmath4-core percolation based on a degree - constrained pruning process @xcite , the @xmath4-core percolation with an inducing effect on the intact ( not failed ) nodes exerted by the collapsed ones @xcite , the core percolation with a greedy leaf - removal procedure @xcite , and a node removal process based on articulation points each of which can disintegrate a network into multiple components after its removal @xcite .",
    "when we consider the networks with directional interactions , we have examples as the emergence of giant strongly connected components against random node removals @xcite , the core percolation in specific contexts of defining leaves and node removals @xcite . with the notion of multilayer networks @xcite ,",
    "the effect of the coupling between nodes or node copies on the network resilience are studied through the stability of connected components under a random node removal @xcite and a @xmath4-core - like pruning process @xcite .",
    "the interaction direction is further incorporated into the multilayer networks to explore their resilience based on the size of the strongly connected components against a random node removal @xcite . besides the above research line of the network resilience in various contexts , there is another one on the implication of interaction directions on networks from the perspectives of the structural organization @xcite and the dynamical processes on them @xcite . yet",
    "the intersection of the two research lines , the effect of interaction directions on the network resilience , is still far from being fully discussed from an analytical perspective except for the above few cases , on which we lay our focus in this paper .    here",
    "we analytically study the transition behaviors in the resilience of directed networks through a node failure model .",
    "one of the obvious structural signatures from the interaction directions in directed networks is the existence of in- and out - degrees for a node ( respectively the numbers of in - coming and out - going interactions ) rather than simply the degree for a node ( the number of adjacent undirected interactions ) in undirected networks .",
    "then it is convenient to study the resilience of directed networks with a node failure model which is based separately on the in- and out - degrees of nodes .",
    "we consider a failure scheme here : a node is in failure once it has too small an in - degree or an out - degree .",
    "the motivation of the failure model is that , in systems with directed or asymmetrical interactions such as those involving information flows or purely with a principle of redundancy design , the proper functioning of each constituent can be assumed to be based on sufficient sizes of both its neighbors from which it receives interactions and to which it delivers influences . formulating the above idea into a pruning process on a directed network ,",
    "we randomly and iteratively remove any node with an in - degree smaller than an integer @xmath5 or with an out - degree smaller than an integer @xmath6 along with all its adjacent arcs , and we study the relative size of the macroscopic residual subgraph . as we can see , the above process is basically an extension of @xmath4-core pruning process on undirected networks into the case with directed interactions .",
    "this pruning process is initially discussed in @xcite , which lists the sizes of all the non - trivial residual structures after the above pruning process on a real network as a tool for data analysis .",
    "yet a detailed theoretical analysis of the percolation problem resulted from the process on directed networks , or the @xmath7-core percolation as we can simply put , is still missing . in this paper , we consider the @xmath7-core percolation problem as a solvable model for the resilience study of the directed networks , and we mainly work on the derivation of an analytical framework and the analysis of its transition behaviors .",
    "there are two parts of our main results . @xmath8",
    "the @xmath7-core percolation problem with @xmath2 or @xmath3 shows abrupt transitions on infinitely large directed random networks , which can be proved with our analytical framework .",
    "@xmath9 we compare the relative size of the @xmath7-core on a directed random graph with that of the @xmath4-core on its undirected counterpart when the arc directions are totally ignored , which is equivalent to the residual structure after a pruning process on the same directed graph as any node with a total degree ( the sum of in - degree and out - degree ) @xmath10 is removed iteratively . based on the transition points of the @xmath7-core percolation of a directed random graph and the @xmath4-core percolation on its undirected graph counterpart",
    ", we can see from an analytical perspective that when a macroscopic @xmath7-core is permitted in some case , a @xmath4-core with a much larger @xmath4 than @xmath11 and @xmath12 is possible , indicating that the introduction of unidirectional interactions between nodes can drive the connected systems more vulnerable against external perturbations based on in - degrees and/or out - degrees of nodes .    here",
    "is the structure of the paper . in sec.[sec : model ] , we explain the pruning process and the percolation problem in a general setup in networks with both undirected and directed interactions . in sec.[sec : theory ] , we present an analytical theory for the problem on random networks with only unidirectional interactions . in sec.[sec : results ] , we test the theory on model directed random networks and also real network data sets , in which we also examine the discontinuity and the scaling property of the hybrid transitions . in sec.[sec : conclusion ] , we conclude the paper with a discussion .",
    "first we explain some notions for directed networks . we consider a directed network instance @xmath13 with a node set v ( @xmath14 ) and an arc set a ( @xmath15 ) , correspondingly its arc density @xmath16 .",
    "( as we mainly consider directed networks in this paper , there is no need to confuse the arc density @xmath17 here with the usually adopted notation @xmath17 for the mean connectivity of undirected networks . )",
    "a directional arc between two nodes in the network , say @xmath18 and @xmath19 , is denoted as an ordered pair @xmath20 as an interaction or relation pointing from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . for an arc @xmath20",

    "we further define two excess degree distributions . for a randomly chosen arc @xmath20 , from node @xmath18 following the arc direction to node @xmath19 , the probability of node @xmath19",
    "having @xmath27 in - neighbors and @xmath28 out - neighbors is @xmath30 ; from node @xmath19 following the opposite arc direction to node @xmath18 , the probability of node @xmath18 having @xmath27 in - neighbors and @xmath28 out - neighbors is @xmath31 .",
    "we simply have @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    on a directed graph @xmath13 ,",
    "an initial fraction @xmath34 $ ] is defined in a starting step , and a fraction @xmath35 of nodes are randomly chosen and further removed along with all their adjacent arcs .",
    "an iterative pruning process is then carried out as any node @xmath18 with an in - degree @xmath36 or an out - degree @xmath37 is removed , along with all its adjacent arcs .",
    "we can see that if there are some nodes remained after the removal process , any node @xmath18 in this subgraph has both an in - degree @xmath38 and an out - degree @xmath39 .",
    "we simply call the collection of the residual nodes and arcs as the @xmath7-core or the core structure , and the emergence of a macroscopic residual subgraph as the @xmath7-core percolation",
    ". the corresponding pruning process can be named as the @xmath7-core pruning process .",
    "see figure [ fig : model ] for some examples of the elementary pruning steps in the @xmath7-core percolation .",
    "the above model is considered on networks with only directed arcs , yet it can be also defined in a generalized case on networks with both undirected edges and directed arcs @xcite . in a mapping procedure , each undirected edge is considered as a degenerate connection , and is further split into two directed arcs in opposite directions . for example , an undirected edge as an unordered pair @xmath40 between nodes @xmath18 and @xmath19 is split into two directed arcs @xmath20 and @xmath41 . after this mapping procedure , the @xmath7-core percolation can be well - defined on the new graph with only directed arcs . as a special example",
    ", the @xmath4-core percolation on an undirected network can be considered as the @xmath42-core percolation on its directed network counterpart after the above mapping . in such a general setting",

    "on directed er random graphs is that a @xmath86-core emerges around an arc density where a @xmath101-core suddenly shows up on the undirected counterparts , which means for a directed er random graph which permits a certain @xmath7-core , a macroscopic @xmath4-core with a much larger parameter @xmath4 than @xmath11 and @xmath12 is possible when the arc directions are ignored .",

    "<S> how the interaction directions affect the network resilience still lacks thorough exploration . here , we study the resilience of directed networks with a simple failure procedure based on both the in- and out - degrees of nodes , in which any node with an in - degree @xmath0 or an out - degree @xmath1 is removed iteratively . with an explicit analytical framework </S>",

    "<S> we show that the discontinuous transitions rise for cases with @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and the unidirectional interactions among nodes drive the networks more vulnerable against perturbations based on in- and out - degrees separately . </S>"
