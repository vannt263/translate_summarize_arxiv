    "inflation @xcite is widely regarded as the mechanism behind the generation of the density fluctuations that eventually led to the formation of large scale structure in the universe . in its simplest version ,",
    "inflation is driven by a scalar field , the inflaton , which slowly rolls down its potential . while the total energy density is dominated by the inflaton s potential energy , the universe grows exponentially fast .",
    "eventually , the inflaton decays and reheats the universe @xcite , giving rise to a radiation - dominated era of expansion consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "given that we do not have a compelling candidate for the inflaton or for the fields it decays into during reheating , most of the work in inflationary cosmology focuses on the properties of different models and how they can be constrained by current data @xcite .    a particular class of slow - roll inflation models that is still viable by present constraints is provided by hybrid inflation @xcite , where in addition to the inflaton @xmath2 , there is another field @xmath3 , called the `` waterfall '' field .",
    "while the inflaton has a zero vev , the waterfall field has a nonzero vev . during inflation , the waterfall field is trapped at the minimum of its potential . after the inflaton crosses below a critical value @xmath4 during its slow roll , the curvature at the origin becomes negative and the waterfall field undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking : both fields are quickly driven towards their vevs , effectively terminating inflation and setting the initial conditions for reheating @xcite .    the dynamics of reheating after hybrid inflation has been studied both analytically and numerically @xcite . in this paper , we report results of 3d numerical simulations of the coupled scalar field equations just after the end of hybrid inflation , as the waterfall field @xmath3 relaxes spinodally towards its vev and the inflaton starts to oscillate about its minimum . because of the quadratic coupling between the two fields , nonlinear effects are prevalent .",
    "indeed , inflaton `` hot spots '' were reported in @xcite , while `` condensate lumps '' were found for a class of supersymmetric models in @xcite . here",
    ", we observe the emergence of long - lived , time - dependent field configurations , which we identify as a new class of two - field oscillons @xcite .",
    "if oscillons are sufficiently long - lived , that is , if their lifetime is at least of order of @xmath5 , they can have important consequences for the cosmological dynamics . the potential role of oscillons in cosmology has been investigated in 1d simulations @xcite , while 3d simulations have been carried out in the case of a single real field in a double - well potential @xcite and in the case of a @xmath6 potential @xcite where the emergence of flat - top oscillons @xcite was studied .",
    "we find that these two - field , `` hybrid oscillons '' are indeed very long - lived , and emerge for a wide range of model parameters . given that the inflaton must couple to other fields , and that oscillons have been found in a wide variety of models , from abelian - higgs models @xcite to the standard model @xcite , we should expect oscillonlike structures to emerge during preheating , considerably enriching the post - inflationary dynamics and the reheating of the universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the model with two coupled scalar fields , in the absence of cosmological expansion , and show that it admits spherically - symmetric oscillonlike solutions .",
    "these solutions are attractors in field configuration space : different initial conditions lead to long - lived , localized configurations with the same total energy .",
    "we also show that our model admits two different types of these oscillon solutions : the `` ground state , '' where oscillons have similar lifetimes and energies to the well - known single - field models @xcite , and a newly found `` excited state , '' where oscillon lifetimes can be three to four times as large as those for the ground state .",
    "we may think of the excited state as a metastable state with two possible decay channels : either it decays by directly radiating its energy to spatial infinity or , quite interestingly , it decays to the ground state configuration , where it remains for a while before radiating its energy to spatial infinity .",
    "this two - step decay inspires us to associate these higher - energy configurations with excited oscillon states . in sec .",

    "[ sec : results ] we report results from numerical simulations in an expanding universe , calculating the fraction of energy in oscillons for a range of values of the ratio of coupling constants @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the quadratic coupling between the two scalar fields and @xmath9 is the quartic coupling of the waterfall field .",
    "moreover , we show that for @xmath10 , oscillon production is particularly efficient , with the fraction of energy in oscillons reaching approximately 20% .",
    "we show that this effect is due to parametric resonance of a band of low @xmath11 modes of the waterfall field , arising from the resonant oscillation of its zero mode and of the inflaton about its minimum .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results and directions for future work .",
    "in @xcite , spherically - symmetric oscillons were found in a single scalar field model with a symmetric ( and also with asymmetric ) double - well potential , starting from an initial gaussian field profile that interpolated between the two minima of the potential . we perform a similar analysis in @xmath12 dimensions , now working with two scalar fields",

    "we have verified that any further reduction of @xmath29 and @xmath30 does not affect our results .",
    "we add a damping term near the lattice boundary to absorb any radiation that may be reflected back and interfere with the oscillon evolution @xcite .",
    "we ensure that no energy comes back into the oscillon region by computing the flow of energy through the `` energy shell '' and verifying that no energy goes back in .",
    "the equations of motion contain two free parameters , as of yet unconstrained : the ratio of the square of the two mass scales @xmath31 , and the ratio of couplings @xmath7 . since the main goal of this paper is not to explore in detail the properties of two - field oscillons ( a worthy task left for a future publication ) but to show that they exist and explore their cosmological implications , in this section we fix the parameters as @xmath32 and @xmath33 , even though oscillons can be found for a wide range of these two parameters .",
    "the reason for this choice will become apparent in the next section . we note that with these values , the fundamental frequencies of oscillation near the minimum of the potential ( at @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) are almost equal , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    we have solved the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations eqs .

    "few modes are amplified and only weakly , explaining the left part of fig .",
    "[ rho_osc ] . on the other hand , for @xmath203 , modes with @xmath204 are significantly amplified , giving rise to a considerable number of oscillons .",
    "note also the near - constant bands of the amplified modes for these values of @xmath7 , which clearly correlates with the flat plateau in energy in fig .",
    "[ rho_osc ] .",
    "( as we remarked above , for values of @xmath205 , @xmath2 oscillates with small and eventually negligible amplitude , while @xmath3 reaches a maximum amplitude of oscillation . )",
    "most importantly , near @xmath206 , modes with @xmath207 undergo large amplification leading to copious production of oscillons .",
    "this explains the resonant peak in fig .",

    "we have investigated the nonlinear dynamics of hybrid inflation cosmological models featuring two coupled scalar fields : the inflaton @xmath2 , with a quadratic potential , and a waterfall field @xmath3 , with a double - well potential . the fields couple quadratically with strength @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "exploring the model first in static minkowski space , we have found that even without cosmic expansion , the model has very rich dynamical features .",
    "we have shown that it supports the existence of long - lived , spherically - symmetric , coherent time - dependent structures , which we described as a new class of oscillons @xcite .",
    "these objects appear in two possible states , which we have called ground and excited . in some cases ,",
    "the excited state was seen to relax into the ground state , where it persisted before finally decaying .",
    "the lifetimes of this new class of two - field oscillons were measured to be five times longer than their single - field counterparts . given that our main focus in this work is the cosmological relevance of oscillonlike structures , we have not provided a detailed analysis of their properties , although their enhanced lifetime is likely a consequence of resonant behavior .",
    "we believe they are an excellent laboratory in which to investigate the effects of resonances in coupled - field models able to support localized , coherent ( solitonlike ) time - dependent field configurations , a topic worthy of further study in its own right .",
    "coupling the two - field model to the cosmological expansion , we have solved the friedmann - klein - gordon system of three coupled equations in three spatial dimensions .",
    "we started the simulation near the end of inflation , as the inflaton field @xmath2 breaks the symmetry of the @xmath3 field , which relaxes to its global minimum .",
    "we note that the fields were initialized as gaussian random variables , but remarkably self - organized to generate a network of long - lived oscillons as the fields oscillate about their minima . for certain choices of the couplings",
    ", we have shown that the long - lived structures persist for at least four cosmological expansion times .",
    "there were three regimes , determined by the value of the ratio of couplings , @xmath7 .",
    "the most interesting results were found for @xmath209 , when oscillons were formed .",
    "their contribution to the energy density of the universe can be as much as @xmath210 , in a renormalizable model with realistic couplings that is consistent with wmap 7-year data . finally , we explained the formation of oscillons and their substantial contribution to the total energy of the universe as a consequence of parametric resonance .",
    "there are many interesting open questions to explore .",
    "apart from studying the dynamics of the two - field model in static space in more detail than in sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] , it would be interesting to examine how our results would vary if we included couplings to other fields in both minkowski and expanding spacetimes .",
    "in particular , even though the oscillations of @xmath2 are supposed to generate the reheating of the universe and its transition to a radiation - dominated expansion , we have not incorporated the couplings to other fields that would initiate a radiation - dominated era .",
    "hence , we found a transition to a matter - dominated cosmos instead",
    ". what will be the role of oscillons during reheating ? if previous results are an indication , oscillons will act as bottlenecks for energy equipartition , delaying the approach to equilibrium @xcite . in this case , they or other possible time - dependent coherent structures will strongly influence the value of the reheating temperature , providing a key constraint to our understanding of the physics of the early universe . the fact that oscillons may contribute a sizable fraction of the total energy in the universe suggests that they could have played a role in baryogenesis .",
    "while baryons produced before inflation are inflated away or , if produced after , are wiped out as the universe equilibrates , oscillons remain out of equilibrium .",
    "it would interesting to examine if the time - scale associated with the oscillations of the scalar fields in oscillons , or even their lifetime itself , may be used as a mechanism to generate a baryon asymmetry . work along these lines is currently in progress .",
