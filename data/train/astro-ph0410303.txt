    "hot star winds are accelerated mainly by absorption of radiation in resonance lines .",
    "this process can be divided into two steps :    1 .",
    "transfer of light momentum to c , n , o , fe , etc .",
    ", by absorption of radiation , and by thomson scattering to free electrons , 2 .",
    "transfer of obtained momentum to predominant wind component ( h , he ) .",
    "since the acceleration of different wind species may be different , their wind velocities may differ and so hot star winds have a multicomponent nature . for _ high density _ winds ( e.g. of galactic o stars ) this multicomponent nature does not influence the wind structure , however for _ low density _ winds multicomponent effects occur , for example frictional heating , decoupling of wind components , etc .",
    "( see krtika & kubt 2001 ) . to estimate the importance of multicomponent effects for the winds of central stars of planetary nebulae we calculate multicomponent wind models for these stars .",
    "basic assumptions of our models are the following :    * we assume a stationary spherically - symmetric flow , * we solve the continuity , momentum and energy equations for each component of the flow , namely for absorbing ions , nonabsorbing ions ( hydrogen and helium ) , and electrons ( see krtika & kubt 2001 ) , * we assume solar chemical composition , * line radiative force is calculated in the cak approximation ( castor , abbott & klein 1975 ) , we neglect wind instabilities and magnetic fields .",
    "for each component @xmath0 of the flow ( i.e. accelerated ions , passive component ( hydrogen and helium ) and electrons ) we solve continuity , momentum and energy equations in the form of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density of a component @xmath0 , @xmath3 is radial velocity , @xmath4 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath5 is the radiative acceleration either due to the line - transitions or due to the electron scattering , @xmath6 is the electric polarisation field , @xmath7 is the frictional acceleration , @xmath8 is the temperature , @xmath9 is the radiative heating / cooling term ( calculated using electron thermal balance method , kubt et al .",
    "1999 ) , @xmath10 is the heat exchange and @xmath11 is the frictional heating .",
    "the frictional acceleration @xmath7 depends on the velocity difference via the chandrasekhar function ( @xmath12 ) ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the error - function and the relative velocity difference between wind components @xmath0 and @xmath15 is @xmath16    for small relative velocity differences , @xmath17 , the chandrasekhar function @xmath18 is increasing , the flow is stable in this case , however for larger velocity differences , @xmath19 , @xmath18 is decreasing ( see fig.[chandra ] ) .",
    "the latter behaviour enables _ decoupling _ of wind components , the flow is unstable for larger velocity differences ( owocki & puls 2002 , krtika & kub ' at 2002 ) .",
    "_ frictional heating _ is important if the velocity difference is comparable with averaged thermal speed , @xmath17 .",
    "an example of frictionally heated wind model is given in fig.[ohrev ] .",
    "if the relative velocity difference between wind components is higher than the averaged thermal speed , @xmath19 , _ the wind components may decouple_. an example of model with hydrogen decoupling is given in fig.[hoddel ] .",
    "using our wind models , for stars with @xmath21 we have derived regions in the @xmath22 diagram with different types of stellar winds ( see fig.[trpaslici ] ) . corresponding evolutionary track by blcker ( 1995 ) of a post - agb stage",
    "is also plotted in this figure .",
    "apparently , in the course of the post - agb evolution also the stellar wind evolves . at the initial stages",
    "the stellar wind can be regarded as a one - component . during the subsequent stellar cooling the stellar wind becomes frictionally heated and",
    "subsequently either hydrogen falls back onto the stellar surface or pure metallic wind exists .",
    "the coolest stars do not have any wind .",
