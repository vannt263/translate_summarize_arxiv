    "the recent progresses of experimental studies of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices ( ols )  @xcite and in particular , the direct observation of a gap soliton  @xcite have stimulated many studies of the dynamics of matter waves in periodic media ( see e.g. the reviews @xcite and references therein ) . in relation with nonlinear matter waves ,",
    "ols provide a tool for changing the effective properties of the atomic medium allowing the existence of solitary waves in condensates with positive scattering length .",
    "moreover , deformed ols offer additional possibilities for manipulating the soliton dynamics .",
    "in particular , smoothly modulated lattices are effective in controlling the quasi - one - dimensional dynamics of small amplitude gap solitons  @xcite .",
    "the study of various types of localized defects and their interaction with matter waves has been considered in different contexts , ranging from experimental studies  @xcite and different theoretical works studying the emission of vortices in the superfluid flow of a bec around a defect  @xcite , the generation of gray solitons and sound waves by a moving defect  @xcite , the drag force appearing at large velocities of a moving defect in a bec  @xcite , and the combined effect of a static defect and trapping potential  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have explored theoretically some features of the stationary configurations of a bec under the simultaneous effect of an ol and of a strongly localized defect .",
    "this leads to the existence of localized states , termed _ nonlinear defect modes _ , which can be driven through hundreds of periods of an ol . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , addressing the problems of existence , stability , and generation of stationary modes localized in the vicinity of the defect , and consider the possibility of the dynamical interactions between defect modes . we provide details of an approximate analytical description of defect modes , outlined in  @xcite and",

    ", we will exploit the fact that in the presence of an ol , the wave function of the bec can be expanded on a set of wannier functions ( wfs )  @xcite localized on each potential well @xcite and modulated by an envelope .    before going into details , we would like to mention that the theory of nonlinear defect modes in one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic media , is an issue of high relevance also for the theory of photonic crystals .",
    "the case of lattices with shallow grating was recently addressed in  @xcite within the framework of the coupled - mode equations for the counter - propagating waves . in the same approximation , light propagation in nonlinear fibers with slowly modulated bragg gratings",
    "was considered in ref .",
    "the research reported in the present paper , as well as in earlier publications  @xcite , differs not only by the physical model , but also by the fact that the grating is considered to be deep and the dynamics is studied numerically within the full 1d equation .    in this context",
    "it is also relevant to mention studies of impurity modes in the framework of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation  @xcite , since in the tight - binding approximation , i.e. in the limit opposite to shallow lattices , the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with a periodic potential can be mapped into the discrete nls equation  @xcite .",

    "[ ii ] we expand the wave function in terms of the wf s and derive coupled equations governing the evolution of the envelope .",
    "then , in sec",
    ". [ iii ] we provide the simplest analytical solutions corresponding to stationary defect modes .",
    "we also study the dynamics and stability of these modes by direct numerical simulations of the 1d gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "another interesting question is the possibility of moving these defect modes , which we consider in sec .",

    "[ v ] we propose several ideas for the generation of defect modes in realistic experiments . finally , in sec .  [ vi ] we summarize the outcomes .",
    "we consider a bec trapped in a quasi-1d configuration , i.e. tightly confined by a trap potential in the transverse direction , providing a cigar - shaped geometry .",
    "we also suppose that the system is subject to a 1d periodic potential , which is created by laser beams and whose axis is directed along the longitudinal direction of the trap . provided",
    "the density of atoms is small , such a system is governed by the 1d gp equation ( see e.g.  @xcite for the details of derivation ) , which in dimensionless variables reads @xmath0 here @xmath1 stands for repulsive and @xmath2 for attractive atom - atom interactions , @xmath3 is an ol potential and @xmath4 is a defect potential .",
    "the dimensionless variables are chosen so that the energy is measured in the units of the recoil energy @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the lattice constant .",
    "then the temporal and spatial coordinates are measured in the units of @xmath8 and of @xmath9 , respectively , and the period of an ol potential is @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "the dimensionless macroscopic wave function is normalized as follows @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scattering length .    in order to provide a formal derivation of the approximate equations we will assume that the defect potential is localized in space on a distance smaller than one lattice period , what mathematically can be expressed as @xmath14  @xmath15 ( the numerical studies presented bellow show that this region can be significantly enlarged ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will restrict our analysis to symmetric ol potentials @xmath16 and represent the defect potential in the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are symmetric , @xmath19 , and antisymmetric , @xmath20 , parts , respectively .    in the absence of nonlinearity , eq .",

    "we introduce an expansion of the macroscopic wave function @xmath21 over the orthonormal set of the bloch functions @xmath22 of the linear eigenvalue problem @xmath23 hereafter @xmath24 stands for the number of the zone , subject to convention that the lowest allowed band has zero number , @xmath25 is the wavevector considered in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) , @xmath26 $ ] .",

    "then the respective characteristic scale @xmath48 of @xmath49 in the momentum space is much smaller than the vector of the reciprocal lattice ( since @xmath50 ) @xmath51 meantime the scale of the variation of @xmath52 with respect to either of the arguments exceeds one .",
    "in other words , we assume that @xmath49 is a strongly localized function , compared with @xmath52 , the latter being weakly dependent on both @xmath25 and @xmath53 .",

    "subject to these conditions and taking into account the inequality ( [ cond ] ) and the fact that @xmath57 is localized about @xmath54 we conclude that the exponential factors @xmath58 in ( [ nl1 ] ) can be substituted by @xmath59 ( with exponential accuracy ) , what allows us to introduce @xmath60 and rewrite eq .",

    "the nonlinearity ( [ w1 ] ) is another cause for inter - band tunneling .",
    "therefore one can expect that a one - band approximation , successfully reproducing gap solitons in some homogeneous lattices @xcite , may not work properly when the combined effect of the defect and the nonlinearity are considered .",
    "below we will see , however , that this is not always so .",
    "we will also require that the potential @xmath3 is such that the lowest even ( including zero ) and odd bands to have even and odd wfs , what , in particular , means that @xmath65 this is the case of a symmetric ol potential , @xmath66 having a local minimum at @xmath67 : @xmath68 .",

    "this means that the lattice originates an effective coupling of the bands with the same parity ( i.e. for example atom transfer between band @xmath72 and @xmath73 or between bands @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) .",
    "this fact leads us to the next simplification of the problem , considering the _ two - band approximation _ assuming that initially all atoms possess energies in the two lowest bands , and thus only the bands ( with @xmath72 and @xmath74 ) will contribute to the bec dynamics .",

    "[ fig_shift ] ( a ) , ( b ) ( for cosh - mode ) and fig .  [ fig_shift ]",
    "( e ) , ( f ) ( for sinh - mode ) , in this situation , the defect modes follow the position of the center of the defect potential , i.e. after some relaxation time the defect mode follows the defect position .",
    "however , when the defect is shifted by a half - period , both modes become unstable and spread out as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ] ( c ) , ( d ) ( for cosh - mode ) and fig .  [ fig_shift ] ( g ) , ( h ) ( for sinh - mode ) .",
    "the observed behavior can be understood by realizing that a positive defect corresponds to local repulsion of the atoms having real , and thus positive , mass .",
    "then , being placed on top of the maximum of the lattice potential the defect results in strong local repulsion of the atoms , what leads to decay of the defect mode .",
    "this does not happen when the shift of the defect mode is @xmath10 since in that case the local repulsion induced by the defect is compensated by the local attraction of the lattice potential , and for the whole excitation the effective mass approximation is applied .    in the case of a two - hump cosh",
    "- mode the picture changes drastically . by shifting the defect to the next adjacent minimum ( in our case to the right )",
    "we observe that the mode breaks into two parts : a one - hump mode , which after a relaxation time stabilizes around the new potential minimum where the defect is centered , and a mode moving outwards the defect with a constant velocity [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ] ( i)-(j ) ] .",
    "if , however , the defect is shifted to the nearest potential maximum ( i.e. to @xmath188 ) the two - hump cosh - mode evolves into a one - hump mode stabilized at the position of the defect [ fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ]  ( k ) , ( l ) ] .",
    "while this behavior may seem contradictory to what we observed in the case of the one - hump cosh - mode , it can be understood by taking into account that now the defect is negative : @xmath189 , and thus acts as repulsive impurity for the wavepackets having negative effective mass and as attractive impurity for real atoms .",
    "let us now think of the two - hump solutions as two wavepackets whose attraction is balanced by the repulsive defect placed between them .",
    "then , a shift of the defect to the right by one lattice period destabilizes this balance and pushes the right - placed wavepacket in the positive direction , what leads to its motion [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ]  ( i),(j ) ] . also , the attraction between the two wavepackets results in a small shift of the left - placed wavepacket toward the defect .",
    "when the defect is shifted by @xmath190 and is placed on top of the nearest local maximum of the ol [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ] ( k),(l ) ] , its effect is dramatically reduced by the lattice maximum , which acts in the opposite sense .",
    "therefore , the repulsion between the left and right waves is reduced what leads to their motion toward each other and collapsing in one localized wavepacket .",
    "the proposed interpretation of the phenomenon was supported by further studies of the dynamics of two - hump cosh - modes .",
    "first , after a sudden switch off of the defect without any dislocation , we observed a merging of the two wavepackets very similar to one shown in fig .  [ fig_shift ]  ( l ) .",
    "next , we have observed continuing motion of the wavepacket ( after separation with the defect , it can be more appropriately called envelope soliton ) as it would be reflected by the defect , although weakened by the lattice potential . the first stages of such dynamics are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ]  ( l ) . finally , by increasing the strength of the defect we succeeded to create a more localized wavepacket moving faster .",
    "the response of the tanh - modes , given by the formula ( [ tanh ] ) , under a shift of the defect is shown in fig.[fig_shift ]  ( m)-(t ) .",
    "the one - hole tanh - mode follows the defect shift to the nearest potential minimum accompanied by excitation of oscillating dynamics of the mode amplitude .",
    "when the defect is shifted to the nearest maxima the one - hole tanh - mode breaks into two modes which move outwards in opposite directions [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ]  ( o ) ,  ( p ) ] . in order to understand the dynamics of a dark mode , in the same spirit as this",
    "was done above for the bright modes , we interpret the mode as a dark soliton interacting with a delta - impurity and recall the results on such interaction  @xcite . in the case at hand @xmath189 and @xmath132 ,",
    "what in terms of the equation ( [ nls - del - sinlge ] ) means that the impurity attracts the soliton having initially zero velocity : as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite [ see the formula ( 16 ) there ] the initial acceleration of the soliton due to attraction is proportional to @xmath191 .",
    "this explains the dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ]  ( m ) ,  ( n ) .",
    "when the defect has a @xmath190 shift , as it was explained above , its strength in the final position is significantly weakened ( it is now placed on the top of a lattice maximum ) . since the shift of the defect acts as a perturbation of the initials conditions which leads to the decay of a static soliton into two solitons with finite velocities [ moving outwards the defect according to the momentum conservation law , as it is shown in fig .  [ fig_shift ]  ( o ) ,  ( p ) ] .",
    "the decay of defect modes into two solitons is more evident in the case of a two - hole initial condition and with a repulsive impurity which is repulsive for the static soliton ( see eq . ( 16 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) shown in fig.[fig_shift ] ( s ) , ( t ) for the @xmath190 shift of the defect position . at the same time , the two - hole tanh - mode displays more sophisticated evolution , shown in the panel ( q ) , ( r ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ] . after the shift of the defect to the nearest lattice minimum ,",
    "the two holes start to behave as two dark solitons , one of them ( the one closer to the new position of the impurity ) being trapped while the other one moves far from the impurity .      in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the robustness of the cosh - mode described in the preceding subsection allows one to drive the defect mode along the lattice .",
    "since the defect mode is destroyed when it stays close to the local maxima of the potential , in order to provide stable motion of the mode , the defect motion can not be uniform , but described by a step - like function which consists of two characteristic time intervals : a fast enough one , @xmath192 , in which the defect is shifted by one lattice period , and another larger one , @xmath193 , allowing for the defect - mode to recover its shape on the next lattice site .",
    "the physical reasons for the existence of these two characteristic times , @xmath192 and @xmath193 are rather simple .",
    "indeed , the respective microscopic dynamics can be interpreted as a tunneling of part of atoms , attracted by the shifted defect , from the potential well @xmath67 to the neighbor potential well @xmath194 .",
    "let the characteristic tunneling time be @xmath195 .",
    "taking into account that all intermediate states ( i.e. those with center different from @xmath196 , where @xmath34 is an integer ) are unstable , one finds that the requirement @xmath197 must be satisfied .",
    "this last constrain evidently limits the speed with which the mode can be driven along the lattice .    in order to find a numerical estimate for the tunneling time @xmath195 we take into account that we are working in the framework of the effective mass approximation which implies relatively small differences in populations of neighbor potential wells .",
    "also we are dealing with the modes bordering the boundary of the bz , what means that the phase difference between atoms in adjacent cells is @xmath10 .",
    "thus we can use the results for the half - period of oscillations of the linear tunneling of condensate in a double - well potential @xcite : @xmath198 with @xmath199dx,\\ ] ] for a particular potential given by ( [ perpot ] ) ( here we have taken into account that the wfs make up an orthonormal basis ) . in particular , for @xmath158 , the mobility conditions are that the defect must be shifted with a velocity much bigger than @xmath200 and then leave the system to relax for a time @xmath201    in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig.4 ) we have presented an example of how the defect cosh - mode can be driven along the lattice by moving the position of the defect . according to the properties shown fig .",
    "[ fig_shift ] ( e ) , ( f ) , the sinh - mode also can be moved through the lattice .",
    "an example is shown in fig.[figmove ] , where we present the dynamics of the mode as well as the trajectory of the center of the wavepacket @xmath202 @xmath203 and of its dispersion @xmath204 here as usually @xmath205 is a number of particles .    due to the higher scattering on the potential barriers after each defect , shifting the dynamics of this mode",
    "is less robust than for the cosh - mode what leads to its faster dissipation as shown in fig.[figmove ] . also , due to",
    "significant reflection on each period of reconstruction one observes larger deviation of the center of mass of the mode @xmath206 from the defect trajectory @xmath207 as well as significant growth of the width of the wavepacket @xmath208 [ see fig.[figmove ] ( a ) , ( b ) ] . therefore in the following analysis of the motion of defect modes through the lattice we will use cosh - mode .",
    "if the motion of the defect satisfies the conditions and , more sophisticated dynamics can be generated by moving defects .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ figmove_zz ] we show a zigzag trajectory of the cosh - mode induced by the corresponding zigzag motion of the defect .",
    "the defect mode experiences some changes when driven through the lattice . for instance , when driven over ten lattice periods the amplitudes of the initial and final maxima differ by about 10% .",
    "we have also carried out numerical experiments on collisions of defect modes driven by counter - propagating defects . in fig .",
    "[ figmove_coll ] we show an example with two cosh - modes each of them shifted by ten periods from the center in opposite directions .",
    "by moving the defects towards each other we induce a head - on collision at @xmath209 . when the defects continue to be driven after the collision [ fig .",
    "[ figmove_coll](a)-(c ) ] they pass through each other and emerge with substantial shape modifications but still being identifiable [ fig .",
    "[ figmove_coll](c ) ] .",
    "when the defects are stopped at the collision time @xmath210 a single defect mode with larger amplitude and stronger localization appears [ fig .",
    "[ figmove_coll ] ( e ) , ( f ) ] .",
    "a relevant question for experimental studies of defect modes is their generation in real situations .",
    "one of the possibilities consists in generating , first , a gap soliton with energy near a gap edge in an homogeneous ol and subsequently adiabatically switching on the defect by changing the defect amplitude from zero to some value .",
    "this will lead to the transformation of a gap soliton into a defect mode .",
    "a numerical implementation of this scheme is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figexcit_ch ] and [ figexcit_sh ] , where we have presented the dependence of the number of particles @xmath211 _ vs _ the energy of the mode @xmath125 for the original gap soliton ( thin solid lines ) and the emerging defect modes ( thick dashed and dotted lines ) , found by searching stationary modes of eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) .",
    "more specifically , in order to generate cosh- and two - hump cosh - modes we start with the envelope soliton ( as an example consider , say , the point i in fig.[figexcit_ch ] ) with energy @xmath212 .",
    "next , by increasing @xmath150 [ the defect shape is chosen to be ( [ defect ] ) ] we generate one - hump cosh - mode , shown as i@xmath213c transition [ in fig . [ figexcit_ch ] ( b ) and [ figexcit_sh ] ( b ) ] , and by decreasing @xmath150 ( i.e. increasing @xmath214 ) we generate a two- hump cosh - mode , shown as ( i@xmath213b ) transition . in both cases",
    "we used the stationary 1d gp equation with a periodic potential to compute numerically the stationary solutions and then solving the time - dependent equation ( [ nls ] ) with adiabatic growth of the defect amplitude according to the law @xmath215 . it",
    "worth pointing out that in the described transitions the numbers of particles was preserved .",
    "we have followed the same procedure for the generation of a sinh - mode as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ figexcit_sh ] .",
    "however , the difference from the previous case is that to generate a sinh - mode from the gap soliton not only the defect amplitude must be increased adiabatically but also the sign of the interparticle interactions , @xmath216 , must be changed from repulsive to attractive . due to the fact that gap soliton does not exists for attractive",
    "interaction it starts to spread and the only small number of particles transforms into the sinh - mode [ see the process i@xmath213b in fig .",
    "[ figexcit_sh ] ] .",
    "the resulting number of particles and corresponding profile of the sinh - mode slightly depends on the velocity of growth of the defect amplitude [ in the present example we used @xmath217 .",
    "in this paper we have investigated localized defect modes of the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation in the presence of an optical lattice and a localized defect .    using the expansion of the condensate wave function over wannier functions it was shown that the problem can be reduced to the study of the dynamics of the envelope which is governed by the nonlinear schrdinger equation with a delta - impurity ( in the one - band approximation ) , or in a general case by a system of coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations with delta - impurities ( in the two - band approximation ) .",
    "the symmetric analytical solutions the obtained equation in the stationary case describe envelopes of the stationary defect modes of @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220types .",
    "our approximate analytical formulas for impurity modes are in good agreement with results obtained by direct numerical calculations .",
    "we have also verified the stability of the impurity modes by direct numerical simulations of the underlying one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation with a periodic potential and a localized defect showing that the defect modes are indeed stable under small perturbations ( i.e. linearly stable ) .    using the same ideas developed in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that impurity cosh - modes can be made to follow complex trajectories of the defect position while sinh - modes can not be driven so easily .",
    "an example is shown where a zigzag motion of a cosh - mode is induced .",
    "we have also used this control to induce collisions of two mutually displaced defect modes .",
    "the outcome depends on the defect trajectory after the collision being either a pair of driven defect modes or a single defect mode with stronger localization .",
    "finally we have discussed in detail how to excite different types of these defect modes in realistic scenarios .",
