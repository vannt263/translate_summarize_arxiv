    "<S> introduction. _ the aim of quantum tomography is to reconstruct the unknown state of a quantum system by performing suitable measurements on it . </S>",
    "<S> tomography is a vital routine in quantum information , where it is used to characterize output states and test processing devices . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum tomography is a consuming task : in order to obtain enough information for state reconstruction of a @xmath0-level system , it is necessary to perform measurements of @xmath1 different orthonormal bases , or a generalized measurement with at least @xmath2 outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> this poor scaling has led to the search for more efficient methods which allow for a reduction of resources in specific cases .    </S>",
    "<S> recent focus has been on the identification of unknown pure ( or more generally low rank ) states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any two pure states can be distinguished with a measurement having just @xmath3 outcomes @xcite or , when restricting to projective measurements , with only four orthonormal bases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the drawback of these approaches is that the measurements they provide can not distinguish pure states from _ all _ states , implying that one needs to know that the state is pure prior to the measurement in order not to confuse it with mixed states having the same measurement outcome distributions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , none of the approaches allows an efficient recovery algorithm , mainly since the non - convex nature of the problem renders usual techniques from convex optimization useless .    in @xcite , a scheme involving five orthonormal bases along with a reconstruction algorithm </S>",
    "<S> was proposed and experimentally demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , such a scheme allows to certify the purity assumption on the state directly from the measurement outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> however , this method is adaptive in the sense that the outcome distribution of the first measurement affects the choice of the subsequent ones . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if one requires the procedure to work for all pure states the overall number of required measurement settings is considerably larger than five .    at the cost of a slightly higher number @xmath4 of measurement outcomes , tomographic procedures based on compressed sensing allowing for the stable recovery of pure quantum states were proposed in @xcite . rather than providing a functioning measurement setup , these results guarantee that , with high probability , any state can be reconstructed by using sufficiently many randomly drawn measurement settings . from a practical point of view , however , a deterministic approach which provides an explicit measurement set - up may be favourable .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we overcome these drawbacks by constructing five orthonormal bases such that every pure state can be efficiently reconstructed from the corresponding measurements . for any dimension @xmath0 , our set of measurements </S>",
    "<S> is fixed and therefore there is no need for data processing in between the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these measurements distinguish pure states from all states , and this therefore shows that the scaling @xmath5 in the total number of outcomes is the same as without the constraint of having projective measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we prove that the presented set - up is robust with respect to noise . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide reconstruction algorithms for the practical retrieval of the unknown state from the measurement data . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that , as compared to the compressed sensing results of @xcite , our result comes with fewer measurement outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> however , the stability guarantees that we can derive are weaker .    </S>",
    "<S> _ construction of the bases. _ we begin by constructing , for any dimension @xmath0 , five orthonormal bases @xmath6 which determine any pure state among all states . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for any pure state represented by a unit vector @xmath7 , and any density matrix @xmath8 , the equalities @xmath9 imply that @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the construction is an extension of @xcite where , based on the properties of hermite polynomials , four orthonormal bases @xmath11 capable of distinguishing any two pure states were presented . </S>",
    "<S> that construction generalizes easily to any sequence of orthogonal polynomials as explained in @xcite . remarkably , by adding the canonical basis @xmath12 to this set , we obtain the five bases with the desired property .    to begin with , </S>",
    "<S> let us fix a _ sequence of orthogonal polynomials _ </S>",
    "<S> , that is , a sequence @xmath13 of real polynomials such that @xmath14 is of degree @xmath15 and @xmath16 for some positive weight function @xmath17 . for a @xmath0-dimensional system </S>",
    "<S> we will only need the first @xmath1 polynomials . to construct the first two bases , </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath18 be the zeros of @xmath19 , which are real and distinct numbers satisfying @xmath20 for all @xmath21 ( * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> now for @xmath25 , set @xmath26 and denote @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that these are actually orthonormal bases can be readily checked using the christoffel - darboux formula ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.2.2 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the leading coefficient of @xmath14 ( see @xcite for more details ) . </S>",

    "<S> . as the polynomials @xmath19 and @xmath35 have no common zeros , the @xmath36:s are distinct from the @xmath37:s . by a similar reason , @xmath38 for all @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath39 define the non zero vectors @xmath40 and by setting @xmath41 as well as @xmath42 we have arrived at the two orthonormal bases @xmath43 and @xmath44 . </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath46 be a unit vector and let @xmath8 be an arbitrary state such that @xmath47 for all @xmath48 . from the standard basis @xmath49 we get @xmath50 for all @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath15 denote the largest number such that @xmath52 so that by the positivity of @xmath8 , @xmath53 for all @xmath54 . by the definition of the bases and the equalities of the probabilities </S>",
    "<S> we then have @xmath55 for all @xmath56 and @xmath57 , but since the polynomials have degree at most @xmath58 and they vanish on @xmath59 distinct points , they must be identically zero . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the above equalities must hold for all @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote @xmath61 so that @xmath62 and @xmath63 . by looking at the highest degree terms in </S>",
    "<S> and we get @xmath64 , which imply that @xmath65 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements of the two states coincide on the diagonal and the bottom right @xmath66-block . </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed by induction .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , whenever the two states coincide on some bottom right @xmath67-block , with @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> but then the highest degree terms in and give @xmath72 , which yield @xmath73 , that is @xmath74 . secondly , using this and the positivity of @xmath8 we can calculate for all @xmath75 @xmath76 which , since @xmath77 , gives us @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the two states therefore coincide on a larger bottom right block . by induction </S>",
    "<S> , the states must be equal .    </S>",
    "<S> to give an example of the previously explained construction of five bases , we take the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> these are the unique polynomials such that @xcite @xmath80 holds for all @xmath81 and @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 roots of @xmath83 are given by @xmath84 and its leading coefficient is @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the normalized vectors of the first basis are given by @xmath86 and the other bases have similar and equally simple forms .    </S>",
    "<S> _ more general measurements and stability. _ a realistic measurement is affected by noise and therefore can not be described simply by an orthonormal basis . </S>",
    "<S> even more , an optimal measurement for a given task might not even be related to an orthonormal basis . </S>",
    "<S> for these reasons , one needs to have a wider mathematical framework for measurements </S>",
    "<S> . a general measurement in quantum mechanics can be modelled by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xcite , which is a function @xmath87 from a finite set of measurement outcomes @xmath88 to the linear space of @xmath89 hermitian matrices @xmath90 such that @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in practice </S>",
    "<S> one might want to measure more than one povm . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a noisy measurement of each orthonormal basis can be described by a separate povm . by a _ </S>",
    "<S> measurement scheme _ we mean a set @xmath93 of povms . </S>",
    "<S> it is not restrictive to assume that all povms in a given measurement scheme have the same set of outcomes @xmath88 . a measurement scheme @xmath94 therefore induces a linear map @xmath95 from the real vector space @xmath90 to the set of real @xmath96 matrices @xmath97 via @xmath98}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the image of a state @xmath8 is the real matrix whose @xmath99-th row contains the outcome probabilities corresponding to @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> analogously to the case of projective measurements , we say that the measurement scheme @xmath94 determines any pure state among all states if for any pure state @xmath101 and any state @xmath8 , the equality @xmath102 implies @xmath103 . by adapting the argument of ( </S>",
    "<S> * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 1 ) , it is easy to see that a measurement scheme @xmath94 has this property if and only if every non - zero element of @xmath104 ( the kernel of the map @xmath95 ) has at least two positive eigenvalues ( see the supplemental material for the detailed proof ) .    with this framework of measurement schemes we are now prepared to discuss the noise robustness of the result stated in theorem [ thmpca ] . </S>",
    "<S> first , we will need to have a notion of closeness of two measurement schemes , and for this reason we fix norms on the real vector spaces @xmath90 and @xmath97 . since these are finite dimensional vector spaces , all norms are equivalent and the choice is not important for our purposes . </S>",

    "<S> the most notable practical feature of measurement schemes that determine pure states among all states is that they allow for a computationally efficient tomography of pure quantum states ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
