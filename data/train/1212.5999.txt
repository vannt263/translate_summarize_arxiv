    "a symplectic realization of a poisson manifold @xmath1 is a poisson map from a symplectic manifold @xmath2 to @xmath1 , which is also a surjective submersion .",
    "symplectic realizations are very natural objects in poisson geometry from the point of view of integration and quantization theory of poisson manifolds .",
    "namely , following the standard `` quantization dictionary '' that associates a quantum algebra @xmath3 of observables with a poisson manifold @xmath1 ( deformation quantization ) and a hilbert space @xmath4 of states with a symplectic manifold @xmath2 ( geometric quantization ) , a symplectic realization should quantize to a representation of @xmath3 on @xmath4 , which is the object encoding the symmetries at the quantum level ( see @xcite ) .    from the perspective of global integration of poisson manifolds ,",
    "symplectic realizations naturally arise as source maps of symplectic groupoids @xmath5 , which are the objects that integrate poisson manifolds .",
    "symplectic realizations contain a lot of information about integrability .",
    "for instance , crainic and fernandes showed in @xcite that a poisson manifold is globally integrable if and only if it admits a complete symplectic realization .",
    "however , in the global integration case , the symplectic realization do not carry all the information about the integrating symplectic groupoid ( some extra data is needed to define a global inverse map for instance ) .",
    "the situation is different for the local / formal integration of poisson manifolds by local / formal symplectic groupoids .",
    "recall that a local symplectic groupoid is , roughly , the structure obtained by restricting a global symplectic groupoid to a neighborhood of its unit space , while a formal symplectic groupoid is the structure obtained by taking @xmath6-jets of the symplectic groupoid structure maps ( or their pullbacks as in @xcite ) at the unit space .    in the local / formal case , all the structure maps of the local / formal symplectic groupoid , including the inverse map , can be recovered from the source map alone ( @xcite ) , i.e. , from a local / formal symplectic realization .",
    "another simplification in this case is that the domain of the symplectic realization can always be taken to be the cotangent bundle of the poisson manifold , or , more precisely , a local / formal neighborhood of its zero section .    given a poisson manifold @xmath1 , the problem of constructing a local / formal symplectic realization can essentially be tackled in two ways , both of which start by considering a deformation @xmath7 of the zero poisson structure on @xmath8 by a parameter @xmath9 . for the zero poisson structure ,",
    "the canonical bundle projection @xmath10 is a symplectic realization , where the symplectic form on the cotangent bundle is the canonical one @xmath11 .",
    "the first way is to try to deform @xmath11 into another symplectic form @xmath12 such that the bundle projection @xmath13 remains a symplectic realization from @xmath14 ( or from a neighborhood of its zero section ) to @xmath15 .",
    "this approach was the original one of weinstein in @xcite , who gave an integral formula for @xmath12 and proved the result in the case @xmath16 .",
    "the result for a general manifold has been proven recently by crainic and marcut in @xcite .    the second way is the approach of karasev in @xcite that keeps the canonical symplectic form @xmath11 fixed and deforms the bundle projection into a symplectic realization @xmath17 . the formal expansion of @xmath18 in the case @xmath16 has been shown in @xcite to coincide with the formal symplectic realization that one can extract ( see @xcite ) from the tree - level part of the kontsevich star - product given in @xcite .    in this paper , we show , in the case @xmath16 , the explicit relationship between these two constructions ( proposition [ prop : we - kar ] and theorem [ thm : realizations ] ) , and we give a very explicit formula for the formal symplectic realization in terms of topological rooted trees ( theorem [ thm : formula ] and proposition [ prop : weights ] ) .",
    "in section [ sec : general - results ] , we review the construction of @xmath12 as considered in @xcite , and we give a canonical way to obtain a karasev - like realization @xmath18 of any poisson manifold out of the deformed symplectic form @xmath12 by putting it in global darboux form .    in section [ sec : comparison ] ,",
    "we review the formal symplectic realization @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the generating function ( extracted from the kontsevich star - product ) of the formal symplectic groupoid constructed in @xcite that integrates the poisson manifold @xmath21 .",
    "we prove that it coincides with the weinstein realization for @xmath22 when suitably put in darboux form and that the coefficients admit a recursive definition ( theorem [ thm : realizations ] ) .    in section [ sec : formula ] , we show ( theorem [ thm : formula ] ) that @xmath23 is given by the formula @xmath24}\\e^{|t|}\\left(\\frac{w_{t}}{|\\sym(t)|}\\right)d_{t}^{i}l_{v},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 $ ] is the set of topological rooted trees , @xmath26 is the kontsevich weight of the kontsevich graph associated to the topological rooted tree @xmath27 as in figure [ fig : konttree ] , and @xmath28 is the elementary differential ( see definition [ def : elemdiff ] ) associated with @xmath27 and the vector field @xmath29 .",
    "building on kathotia s results in @xcite , we show in proposition [ prop : weights ] that these weights are easily computable : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a recursive formula @xmath32 associated with the rooted tree @xmath33_{\\bullet}$ ] made out of the subtrees @xmath34 by grafting their root to a new additional root , and where @xmath35 when @xmath27 is the rooted tree with only one vertex .",

    "thus , the kontsevich trees that have a non - vanishing contribution to the generating function are of the form              since , for two of these graphs @xmath162 and @xmath292 with @xmath228 arial vertices , we have that @xmath293 , and since there are @xmath294 of these graphs , we obtain the following explicit formula for the corresponding formal symplectic realization in the case of linear poisson structures : @xmath295 where @xmath296 for @xmath297 and @xmath298 is identified with a linear function on @xmath299 , and where we used a well - known result of kathotia in @xcite about the kontsevich weights of these types of kontsevich s graphs .    in this section , we generalize formula in the case of non - linear poisson structures and we express the realization in terms of a sum over topological rooted trees . we show that the only kontsevich trees satisfying in the non - linear case are exactly the ones that kathotia in @xcite calls `` w - computable .

    "the fact that both @xmath162 and @xmath292 have the same underlying topological rooted tree as interior means that they differ by ( 1 ) a relabeling of their aerial vertices , ( 2 ) by a flip of their edge order ( since all of the edges land on @xmath197 except for the second edge of the root ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the first operation leaves both the weights and the bidifferential operators unchanged .",

    "we can prove this by induction using the graphical representation for the kontsevich graphs .",
    "graphically , @xmath369 can be represented as a graph in the following way : start with @xmath162 , detach its single edge landing on @xmath198 from its target , let it point to nothing as illustrated in figure [ fig : deriv ] below ( we will say that this edge points `` in the air '' ) , and label it with @xmath370 ; this procedure implements the differentiation by @xmath371 .",

    "what we need to show now is that @xmath374 with @xmath363 $ ] can be also described as a graph in @xmath372 ( up to a relabeling of the aerial vertices and a number of flips of the edge order ) .",
    "more precisely , we need to show that , in terms of the graphical representation , @xmath374 is obtained from the kontsevich tree @xmath375 with @xmath376 ( up to a relabeling of the aerial vertices ) by removing @xmath198 and letting the single edge landing on @xmath198 pointing in the air with label @xmath370 .",
