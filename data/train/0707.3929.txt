    "many years ago , it was shown that the @xmath1 partial waves of the @xmath2 channel cm scattering amplitude of the current - hadron reaction at @xmath3 exactly correspond to the nachtmann moments.@xcite this fact makes clear that the nachtmann moment@xcite can be used even in the small @xmath4 region where the operator product expansion can not be applied .",
    "now the nachtmann moments at @xmath0 for the spin dependent structure functions take a very simple form and its form is the same as the one which appears in the fixed - mass sum rules from the current algebra based on the canonical quantization on the null - plane .",
    "thus we can treat these sum rules without worrying about the kinematical target mass correction .",
    "the sum rules for the spin dependent structure functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the small @xmath4 region derived in refs.@xcite belong to this category .",
    "these sum rules show that there is a connection among the resonances , the elastic , and the nonresonant continuum in the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 independently . since the born term changes rapidly in the small @xmath4 region , the sum of the resonance and the nonresonant continuum also changes rapidly . in case of the @xmath5 , this explains why the gerasimov - drell - hearn(gdh ) sum changes a sign in the very small @xmath4 region . in case of the @xmath6",
    ", we find that the born term divided by @xmath7 in the sum rule has a very similar behavior with that in the sum rule for the @xmath5 .",
    "this divided born term is nothing but the born term in the schwinger sum rule for the @xmath6,@xcite which was derived also by the fixed - mass sum rule approach.@xcite these analysis show that , when we consider the duality like bloom - gilman,@xcite the proper inclusion of the elastic contribution is indispensable . in this paper , we give a brief review of these sum rules .",

    "the spin dependent part of the fixed - mass sum rule from the current algebra based on the canonical quantization on the null - plane @xcite can be obtained as follows .",

    "the modification which appears on the right hand side of the sum rule ( 10 ) in the null - plane method circumvented the defect . the sum rule ( 12 ) in case of the virtual photon was derived by schwinger@xcite and also by burkhart and cottingham.@xcite at large @xmath4 , since the born term can be neglected , the sum rule ( 12 ) holds for the inelastic reaction . and",

    "the double logarithmic @xmath56 resummation or the total resummation of @xmath57 gives the regge like behavior but the sum rule is also divergent.@xcite in such a situation , it is desirable to discuss the regularization of the sum rule and gives it a physical meaning even when the sum rule is divergent .",
    "now , the regularization of the divergent sum rule has been known to be done by the analytical continuation from the nonforward direction by assuming regge type behavior.@xcite we first derive the finite sum rule in the small but sufficiently large @xmath58 region by assuming the moving pole or cut .",
    "then we subtract the singular pieces which we meet as we go to the smaller @xmath58 from both hand sides of the sum rule by obtaining the condition for the coefficient of the singular piece . after taking out all singular pieces",
    "we take the limit @xmath59 . because of the kinematical structure in the course to derive the sum rule",
    ", we can mimic this procedure in the forward direction by introducing the parameter which reflects the @xmath2 in the non - forward direction . the sum rule obtained in this way",
    "can be transformed to the form where the high energy behavior from both hand sides of the sum rule is subtracted away .",
    "practically , if the cancellation at high energy is effective , since the condition is needed only in the high energy limit , we consider that the sum rule holds irrespective of the condition . in this way",
    ", we subtract the high energy behavior from both hand sides of the sum rule as in the following way .",

    "similarly , since the second term is constrained as @xmath96 we obtain @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the lowest mass in the @xmath99 channel continuum . hence if @xmath100 , the first term and the second term are disconnected .",
    "+        now , in the dgs representation ( 31 ) , the support of the weight function @xmath101 lies in the shaded region in the figure .",
    "an integration path is @xmath102 , where @xmath103 . at the rest frame @xmath104 , hence we obtain @xmath105 . since for the point @xmath106 where",
    "@xmath107 and @xmath108 , the inequality @xmath109 holds , the sign change always occurs in the causality forbidden region @xmath110 as in the figure . in the @xmath95 channel , since @xmath111 , the slope is positive , hence only the region @xmath112 contributes .",
    "therefore @xmath95 channel and @xmath99 channel are disconnected .",
    "thus combined with the discussion after eq.(32 ) , we obtain    @xmath113    and @xmath114 eqs.(33 ) and ( 34 ) give us the dgs representation of the current anti - commutator of the current as @xmath115 the application of this extension for the spin averaged quantity was given in @xcite . for the spin",
    "dependent part , it was given in @xcite but the regularization of the sum rule was not discussed .",
    "now , using the dgs representation for the current anti - commutator , the ( + i ) component of the anti - commutation relation of the current on the null - plane was derived as @xmath116|p , s>_c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 and @xmath118 by the same method as in section 3 , from eq.(36 ) we can get sum rules for the symmetric combination under the interchange @xmath48 , hence for the electroproduction .",
    "the sum rule of the @xmath5 for the proton target is @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 in case of the @xmath6 , we obtain @xmath122 @xmath123 then , we obtain @xmath124 where @xmath125 @xmath126 in the sum rule ( 39 ) can be estimated with use of parameters in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , as far as we consider the small @xmath4 region below @xmath129[gev@xmath130 , this correction term is very small and the sum rule should be satisfied by the contribution below the energy @xmath131[gev ] . the contribution in this region are the resonances , the nonresonant continuum , and the born term .",
    "further , since the born term changes very rapidly in this region , the sum of the resonances and the nonresonant continuum must also change rapidly .",
    "it is just in this region where the sign change of the gdh sum was studied experimentally.@xcite a similar relation with the sum rule ( 39 ) , but the quantity corresponding to the moment at @xmath132 was given in ref.@xcite , because the gdh sum rule@xcite and the ellis - jaffe@xcite sum rule correspond to the sum rule at @xmath132 .",
    "the sum rule ( 39 ) is the exact relation corresponding to the moment at @xmath0 , and the same kind of the sign change occur due to the same physical origin as in the case of the moment at @xmath132 , and hence can be checked experimentally . in such an analysis ,",
    "if combined with the analysis of the moment at @xmath132 , the extraction of the @xmath5 from the experimental data of the assymetry in the resonance region at small @xmath4 will become very important .",
    "now , let us consider another model of the @xmath5 in ref.@xcite from our sum rules ( 39 ) , ( 42),(44 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the born term contributions in the moment at @xmath0 for the @xmath133 and the @xmath134 are very similar , but that of the @xmath135 is very small compared with these since it is proportional to @xmath4 . however",
    ", if this born term is divided by @xmath7 , it has a finite limit as @xmath80 , and has an interesting behavior .",
    "this quantity is the one which appears in the schwinger sum rule for the @xmath135 given as@xcite @xmath136 where we separate the born term in this sum rule .",
    "it should be noted that this sum rule is nothing but the sum rule ( 12 ) derived from the @xmath137 component in the current commutation relation . at large @xmath4 , because the born term becomes negligible , we have the relation for the inelastic part .",
    "@xmath138 thus we can consider the main contribution in the continuum part in the schwinger sum rule comes from a relatively low energy region .",
    "therefore , in the sum rule given as @xmath139 where @xmath140 the main contribution on the left hand side comes from the low @xmath4 region .",
    "since the born term contribution @xmath141 changes rapidly in this region , the left hand side of the sum rule also changes rapidly .",
    "since we have the relation @xmath142 at the elastic point , @xmath143 is related to @xmath144 as @xmath145 now the contribution to the quantity @xmath146 in the sum rule for the @xmath135 corresponding to the moment at @xmath0 comes from the low energy region and we can expect it roughly given by @xmath144 .",
    "thus this sum rule and the schwinger sum rule gives us the same picture that the rapid behavior of the elastic is compensated by the rapid behavior of the resonance and the nonresonant continuum .",
    "now if we plot the born term contributions @xmath147 and @xmath148 , at small @xmath4 below 1[gev@xmath130 we find that these three functions behave very similarly .",
    "the difference between @xmath149 and @xmath148 is very small and moreover the difference is almost constant .",
    "+ though the moments which give @xmath143 and @xmath149 are different , we see that the behavior of the integral of @xmath150 and that of @xmath151 in the small @xmath4 region is very similar .",
    "since the latter is related to the sign change of the gdh sum , this fact may suggest that the @xmath135 is related to this phenomena .",
    "however , in our approach , we have no direct relation between the @xmath133 and the @xmath135 .",
    "sum rules of the spin dependent structure functions based on the canonical quantization on the null - plane corresponding to the moment at @xmath0 are regularized . by taking the regularization point at @xmath152 and relating to the photoproduction , spin dependent structure functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 at small @xmath4 in the low and the intermediate energy region",
    "are shown to be severely constrained .",
    "for example , we find , in the small @xmath4 region near @xmath153(gev / c)@xmath154 , that the integral @xmath155 becomes zero and that it changes the sign from the negative to the positive .",
    "this behavior is caused by the rapid change of the resonances to compensate the rapid change of the elastic to satisfy the sum rule .",
    "it is this rapid change of the resonances which gives the sign change of the gdh sum .",
    "in addition to this tight connection among the resonances , the elastic and the nonresonant continuum , we also find that this behavior is very similar between the @xmath133 and the @xmath135 as pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
