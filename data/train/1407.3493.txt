    "an 1879 text written by thomson ( lord kelvin ) and tait @xcite included the following :     the recent discoveries due to the kinetic theory of gases and to spectrum analysis ( especially when it is applied to the light of the heavenly bodies ) indicate to us _ natural standard _ pieces of matter such as atoms of hydrogen or sodium , ready made in infinite numbers , all absolutely alike in every physical property .",
    "the time of vibration of a sodium particle corresponding to any one of its modes of vibration is known to be absolutely independent of its position in the universe , and it will probably remain the same so long as the particle itself exists . \"    although it took a while to realize , this idea attributed to maxwell @xcite , is the basic idea behind atomic frequency standards and clocks . in this review ,",
    "we focus on frequency standards that are based on _ optical _ transitions , which seems to be implicit in the text above .",
    "optical frequency references have certain advantages over their predecessors at microwave frequencies ; these advantages are now starting to be realized .",
    "the need for more accurate and precise frequency standards and clocks has continued unabated for centuries .",
    "whenever improvements are made , the performance of existing applications is enhanced , or new applications are developed .",
    "historically , the prime application for clocks has been in navigation @xcite , and today we take for granted the benefits of global navigation satellite systems ( gnss ) , such as the global positioning system ( gps ) @xcite . with gps , we can easily navigate well enough to safely find our way from one location to another .",
    "we look forward to navigation systems that will be precise enough to , for example , measure small strains of the earth s crust for use in such applications as earthquake prediction . in addition",
    ", frequency standards provide the base unit of time , the second , which is by definition derived from the electronic ground state hyperfine transition frequency in caesium .",
    "eventually the definition of the second might be based on an optical transition @xcite , but even now , accurate optical frequency standards are becoming de facto secondary standards @xcite .    aside from the benefits of these practical applications , for scientists there is the additional attraction of being able to precisely control a simple quantum system so that its dynamics evolve in its most elemental form .",
    "one exciting possibility is that the evolution may not be as originally expected .",
    "for example , an area of current interest explores the idea that the relative strengths of the fundamental forces may change in time ; this would indicate new physics  @xcite . comparing clocks based on different atoms or molecules",
    "may someday make such effects observable .",
    "another example is the application of clock precision to the study of many - body quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "all precise clocks work on the same basic principle .",
    "first , we require a system that exhibits a regular periodic event ; that is , its cycles occur at a constant frequency , thereby providing a stable frequency reference and a basic unit of time .",
    "counting cycles of this frequency generator produces time intervals ; if we can agree on an origin of time then the device subsequently generates a corresponding time scale . for centuries",
    ", frequency standards were based on celestial observations , for example , the earth s rotation rate or the duration of one orbit of the earth about the sun @xcite . for shorter time",
    "scales other frequency standards are desirable ; classic examples include macroscopic mechanical resonators such as pendulum clocks , john harrison s famous spring based clocks for maritime navigation , and starting in the early 20th century , quartz crystal resonators @xcite .",
    "however , each of these frequency standards had its limitations ; for example , the earth s rotation frequency varies in time , and the frequency stability of macroscopic mechanical resonators are limited by environmental effects such as changes in temperature .",
    "as maxwell realized , an atom can be an ideal frequency standard because , as far as we know , one atom is exactly identical to another atom of the same species . therefore , if we build a device that registers the frequency of a natural oscillation of an atom , say the mechanical oscillations of an electron about the atom s core , all such devices will run at exactly the same frequency ( except for relativistic effects discussed below ) , independent of comparison . therefore",
    ", the requirement for making an atomic frequency standard is relatively easy to state : we take a sample of atoms ( or molecules ) and build an apparatus that produces an oscillatory signal that is in resonance with the atoms natural oscillations . then , to make a clock , we simply count cycles of the oscillatory signal .",
    "frequency standards have been realized from masers or lasers ; in the context of clocks perhaps the most important example is the atomic hydrogen maser @xcite which is still a workhorse device in many standards laboratories .",
    "however , the more common method for achieving synchronization , and the primary one discussed here , is based on observing the atoms absorption . typically , we first prepare the atom in one of the two quantum states ( @xmath0 = lower - energy state , @xmath1 = upper state ) associated with one of its natural oscillations",
    ". we then use a  local oscillator \" that produces radiation around this oscillation frequency and direct the radiation towards the atoms .",
    "the device will be constructed so that we can detect when the atoms change state ; when these state changes occur with maximum probability , then we know that the oscillator frequency is synchronous with the atoms natural oscillation .",
    "the details of this process are discussed below .      the degree to which we can synchronize a local oscillator s frequency to the atoms natural oscillations",
    "is always limited by noise in the measurement protocol we use to establish this synchronization .",
    "in addition , although isolated atoms are in a sense perfect , their natural frequencies can be shifted from their unperturbed values by external environmental effects , typically electric and magnetic fields . therefore , we must find a way to calibrate and correct for these  systematic \" frequency shifts .",
    "even then , there will always be errors in this correction process that we must characterize .",
    "it is therefore convenient to divide the errors into two types : statistical errors that arise from measurement fluctuations and errors in the systematic - effect corrections that are applied to the measured frequencies .",
    "we typically characterize these errors in terms of the fractional frequency errors , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the reference transition frequency and @xmath4 is the frequency error .    for statistical errors ,",
    "let us first suppose we have a perfect local oscillator whose frequency @xmath5 is near @xmath6 , the frequency of the clock atoms under test ( @xmath6 may be shifted from @xmath3 due to systematic effects ) .",
    "we assume we can measure the fractional frequency difference @xmath7 and average this quantity over various probe durations @xmath8 .",
    "a commonly used measure of the noise performance of clocks is the allan variance @xcite @xmath9 ^ 2,\\label{allan_variance}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the @xmath11th measurement of the average fractional frequency difference over duration @xmath8 and where we ideally assume there is no dead time between successive measurements @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the quantity @xmath13",
    "is commonly called the stability ( but is really proportional to the instability ) . more efficient use of data",
    "uses overlapping samples of shorter - duration measurements resulting in the  overlapping \" allan variance .",
    "this and more sophisticated measures , which can reveal the spectrum of the noise are discussed in @xcite , but the essence of the measure is contained in eq .",
    "( [ allan_variance ] ) .",
    "many sources of noise are well - behaved ( stationary ) in the sense that if we average the output frequency of our standard for longer times , our precision on the measured frequency also improves ( @xmath13 decreases ) .",
    "however , other sources of noise , such as systematic shifts that drift over long durations , will cause @xmath13 to level off or increase with increased @xmath8 .",
    "of course , we do nt have perfect standards to compare to , so we always observe @xmath13 for comparison between two imperfect clocks .",
    "nevertheless , if we can compare three or more clocks it is possible to extract the noise performance of each separately @xcite .",
    "systematic errors are more challenging to document , in part because we may not always know their orgin , or even be aware of them !",
    "if the measured frequency stability does not improve or becomes worse as @xmath8 increases , this indicates some systematic effect that we are not properly controlling .",
    "even worse is that stability may improve with @xmath8 but we have not accounted for a ( constant ) systematic offset .",
    "eventually such effects will likely show up when comparing different versions of the same clock ; in the meantime , we must be as careful as possible to account for systematic shifts .",
    "in this paper we will be primarily interested in the physics of optical clocks , the performance and limitations of existing devices , and prospects for improvements .",
    "the status of the field has been summarized in various reviews and conference proceedings @xcite , so that we will not discuss the details of all experiments .",
    "rather , we will focus on aspects of a few high - performance clocks to illustrate the problems and issues that must be faced , as well as prospects for further advances in the state - of - the - art .",
    "our review covers optical atomic clocks based on both trapped single ions and many atoms .",
    "for simplicity , we will use the term  atomic \" clocks but of course a molecular or even a nuclear transition might be an equally viable candidate for a frequency reference .",
    "following the basic idea outlined above , to stabilize the frequency of a local oscillator to an atomic transition , we need to extract a sensitive discriminator signal @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the signal obtained from the atoms and @xmath16 is the frequency of applied radiation .",
    "this signal can then be used to feed back and stabilize the oscillator s frequency .",
    "there will be fluctuations @xmath17 on the measured signal @xmath15 so that assuming no additional noise is injected during the protocol , the corresponding fractional frequency errors of the stabilized local oscillator during one feedback cycle can be expressed as @xmath18 from this expression we see that we want @xmath3 and @xmath14 as large as possible and @xmath17 as small as possible .",
    "if we denote the frequency width of the atomic absorption feature by @xmath4 and the signal strength on resonance as @xmath19 , we can re - express eq .",
    "( [ delta_y_1 ] ) as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-factor of the transition and @xmath23 is a parameter on the order of 1 that depends on the line shape . from this expression for @xmath24 , it appears that the key parameters are signal - to - noise ratio and @xmath22 .",
    "however , we must remember that this is for a single feedback cycle , which , for a given @xmath22 , requires a measurement duration @xmath25 proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath17 is dominated by white frequency noise we then have for repeated measurements @xmath27 where @xmath8 is the total measurement duration and @xmath28 is the number of successive measurements .    to stabilize the local oscillator to the atomic transition",
    ", we will typically first prepare the atoms in one of the two clock states , here the lower - energy state @xmath0 .",
    "we will then excite the clock transition resonance at a frequency near that which gives the maximum value of @xmath29 , which is usually near or at the half - intensity points of the absorption feature . in the absence of relaxation",
    "this leaves the atom in a superposition state @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in most cases discussed in this review ,",
    "the observed signal is derived by use of what hans dehmelt termed the  electron - shelving \" technique @xcite . here",
    ", one of the two states of the clock transition , say the lower - energy state @xmath0 , is excited to a third level by a strongly - allowed electric - dipole  cycling \" transition where this third level can only decay back to @xmath0 .",
    "( we assume @xmath1 is not excited by the cycling transition radiation ) . by collecting even a relatively small number of fluorescent photons from this cycling transition ,",
    "we can discriminate which clock state the atom is projected into upon measurement : if the atom is found in the state @xmath0 it scatters many photons , if its optically - active electron is  shelved \" into the upper clock state @xmath1 , fluorescence is negligible . with this method",
    ", we can detect the projected clock state with nearly 100 @xmath33 efficiency . when applied to @xmath34 atoms simultaneously , the atomic signal and its derivative will increase by a factor of @xmath34 . upon repeated measurements of the state @xmath30 , there will be quantum fluctuations in which state the atom is projected into for each atom .",
    "these quantum fluctuations contribute noise @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the transition probability @xcite .",
    "this  projection \" noise is the standard quantum noise limit in the measurements . added noise , for example phase noise from the probe local oscillator , will increase @xmath13 .    in principle , to stabilize the oscillator to the atomic reference we would only need to probe one side of the absorption line , but in practice it is often necessary to alternately probe both sides of the line and derive an error signal based on the two different values of @xmath37 .",
    "doing so reduces influence of technical noise to the signal .",
    "the feed - back servo is arranged to drive this difference to zero , in which case the mean of the two probe frequencies is equal to the atomic resonance frequency .",
    "equation  ( [ sigma_y_2 ] ) still holds , but since the absorption feature will be symmetric to a high degree , probing on both sides of the line makes the stabilization insensitive to slow variations in probe intensity , resonance linewidth , and detection efficiency .",
    "a particularly simple expression for @xmath13 holds if we probe the resonance using the ramsey method of separated fields @xcite with free - precession time @xmath38 and assume ( 1 ) @xmath39 pulse durations are short compared to @xmath25 , ( 2 ) unity state - detection efficiency , ( 3 ) relaxation rates are negligible compared to @xmath40 , ( 4 ) the duration required for state preparation and measurement ( dead time ) is negligible compared to @xmath25 , and ( 5 ) noise is dominated by quantum projection noise . in this case",
    "@xcite , @xmath41 this expression clearly shows the desirability of high frequency , large atom numbers , long probe times ( with corresponding narrow line - widths ) , and of course long averaging times @xmath8 . if @xmath34 , @xmath25 , and @xmath8 can somehow be preserved , we see that the improvement in @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "stated another way , if @xmath34 and @xmath25 are preserved , the time it takes to reach a certain measurement precision is proportional to @xmath42 , emphasizing the importance of high - frequency transitions .",
    "the advantage of high - frequency transitions had been appreciated for decades during which clock transitions based on microwave transitions ( typically hyperfine transitions ) prevailed .",
    "given the importance of high @xmath3 and narrow linewidths , one can ask why we do nt make the jump to very high frequencies such as those observed in mssbauer spectroscopy . for example , a mssbauer transition in @xmath43ag has @xmath44 hz and a radiative decay time @xmath45 s corresponding to a natural @xmath22 value @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "even with practical limitations , the performance of actual mssbauer systems is still quite impressive .",
    "for example , consider the 93 kev mssbauer transition in @xmath47zn @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath22 s of @xmath48 were observed ( @xcite , fig .",
    "5 ) and a statistical precision of @xmath49 was obtained in 5 days . as is typical in mssbauer spectroscopy , a convenient local oscillator is obtained by using a mssbauer emitter of the same species",
    "whose frequency is swept via the first - order doppler shift when this source is moved at fixed velocity relative to the absorber .",
    "however , systematic effects in @xcite were at a level of around @xmath50 due primarily to pressure effects in the host material and dispersive lineshape effects . more importantly in the context of clocks , there is not a way to observe coherence of the local oscillator ; that is , there is currently no means to count cycles of the local oscillator or compare clocks based on different transitions .",
    "moreover , comparison of mssbauer sources over large distances ( @xmath51 m ) is intractable due to the lack of collimation of the local oscillator radiation . on the other hand ,",
    "if further development of extreme ultraviolet frequency combs  @xcite does produce spectrally narrow radiation sources in the kev region , it will be attractive to revisit the idea of mssbauer spectroscopy for clock applications .",
    "in the optical region of the spectrum , suitable narrow - linewidth transitions were known to exist in many atoms ; however , the missing ingredients until relatively recently were ( 1 ) the availability of lasers with sufficiently narrow spectra that could take advantage of these narrow transitions and ( 2 ) a convenient method to count cycles of the stabilized ( laser ) local oscillators .",
    "these requirements have now been met with improved methods to lock lasers to stable reference cavities @xcite and the development of optical combs that provide the counters and convenient means for optical frequency comparisons @xcite .",
    "these advances mark the beginning of high - precision clocks based on optical transitions .      to a high degree ,",
    "the systematic frequency shifts encountered in optical atomic clocks are the same as for all atomic clocks .",
    "we can divide the shifts into those caused by environmental perturbations ( e.g. , electric or magnetic fields ) and those which we might call observational shifts .",
    "the latter include instrumental effects such as servo offsets and frequency chirping in optical switches ; these are apparatus - specific and best examined in each experimental realization .",
    "more fundamental and universal observational shifts are those due to relativity , which we discuss below .      in simple terms , we need to examine all the forces of nature and consider how each might affect the atomic transition frequencies .",
    "as far as we know , we can rule out the effects of _ external _ strong and weak forces primarily because of their short range .",
    "gravitational effects are important but we include them below when discussing relativistic shifts .",
    "the most important effects are due to electromagnetic fields ; it is useful to break these into various categories , illustrated by some simple examples .",
    "details will follow in the discussions of the various clocks .",
    "[ [ magnetic - fields ] ] magnetic fields + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    static magnetic fields @xmath52 are often applied purposely to define a quantization axis for the atoms . here",
    "we implicitly assume the field is uniform , but inhomogeneties must be accounted for in the case of spread atomic samples .",
    "shifts from these fields often cause the largest shifts that must be corrected for but these corrections can often be implemented with high accuracy .",
    "we write @xmath53 where , for small @xmath54,the first two terms are usually sufficient .",
    "the energies of clock states will depend on the atom s magnetic moment ; for example , the electron spin zeeman effect in the @xmath55 transitions of @xmath56sr@xmath57 gives a relatively large @xmath58 coefficient on the order of @xmath59 hz / t where @xmath60 is the bohr magneton and @xmath61 is planck s constant .",
    "nevertheless , if the quantizing magnetic field is sufficiently stable , by measuring pairs of transitions that occur symmetrically around the unshifted resonance we can compensate for this shift @xcite . as another example , @xmath62 transitions in @xmath63sr and have a much smaller value of @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the nuclear magneton , thereby reducing the shifts substantially .    for atoms with non - zero nuclear and electron spin , hyperfine structure will be present and both @xmath58 and @xmath66 can be significant . in this case",
    "we can often use the traditional  clock \" transitions between lower states @xmath67 and upper states @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the total angular momenta and the projections of the angular momenta on the ( magnetic field ) quantization axis . for these transitions , @xmath71 and for",
    "@xmath72 can be very small .",
    "we can usually determine @xmath54 to sufficient accuracy by measuring a suitable field - dependent zeeman transition .",
    "departures of @xmath54 from its nominal value @xmath73 might also vary in time .",
    "if these variations are slow enough it might be feasible to intermittantly measure field sensitive transitions , or even the clock transition itself , to correct for or servo - compensate the slow variations  @xcite .",
    "some isotopes of interest do not possess @xmath74 zeeman sublevels because of their half - integer total angular momentum .",
    "an example are alkali - like ions without nuclear spin , where the absence of hyperfine structure facilitates laser cooling",
    ". in this case the linear zeeman shift of the reference transition can be compensated by interrogating two zeeman components that are symmetrically shifted like @xmath75 and @xmath76 and determining the average of both transition frequencies .",
    "consequently , the number of interrogations required for a frequency determination is doubled . however , this does not compromise the stability of the standard if magnetic field fluctuations are negligible during the time between interrogations . for the operation of @xmath63sr lattice clock , alternately interrogating opposite",
    "nuclear spin stretched states of @xmath779/2 and taking their averages greatly suppresses the first order zeeman shift .",
    "the second - order zeeman shifts can be determined by fast modulation of the bias magnetic field between high and low values . by using clock transition to directly sample and stabilize the magnetic field , the combined magnetic field",
    "related frequency shift can be measured below 1 @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "[ [ electric - fields ] ] electric fields + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    static electric fields at the site of the atoms can arise from potential differences in surrounding surfaces caused by , for example , differences in applied potentials on surrounding conductors , surface contact potential variations , or charge build up on surrounding insulators . typically , clock states have well defined parity so that first - order perturbations vanish and shifts can often be calculated with sufficient precision in second - order perturbation theory . for the case of trapped ions ,",
    "the static component of the electric field and corresponding stark shifts vanish at the equilibrium position of the ions ; since they do nt move , the static field at their location must be zero .",
    "for neutral atom clocks the static electric field effects are usually small , however at the highest levels of accuracy they must be characterized  @xcite or even stabilized  @xcite .    treating the quadratic stark shift as a small perturbation of the linear zeeman splitting , the shift of the state @xmath79 is given by  @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the angle between the electric field vector and the orientation of the static magnetic field defining the quantization axis . in general , the stark shift is composed of a scalar contribution described by polarizability @xmath82 and , for levels with @xmath83 and @xmath84 , by a tensor part that is proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "in addition to a static electric field , ac electric fields can be present from several sources .",
    "important shifts for both neutrals and ions can arise from laser beams and background blackbody radiation .",
    "for neutral atoms trapped by laser fields , the frequency and polarization of light can be chosen  @xcite so that the ac stark shifts are the same for both clock levels to a high degree and the clock frequency is nearly unshifted ( see sec .",
    "[ section : magic ] ) .",
    "for sympathetically cooled ions as in the @xmath86al@xmath57  logic clock \" , the cooling light can impinge on the clock ion(s ) causing stark shifts that must be accounted for @xcite .",
    "ambient blackbody radiation shifts can be important for both neutrals and ions .",
    "the uncertainty in the shift can be caused by uncertainty in the effective temperature @xmath87 at the position of the atoms and by uncertainties in the atomic polarizabilities . in most cases",
    "the wavelengths of electric dipole transitions originating from one of the levels of the reference transition are significantly shorter than the peak wavelength of the blackbody radiation spectrum of @xmath88 m at room temperature .",
    "consequently , a static approximation can be used and the shift is proportional to the differential static scalar polarizability @xmath89 of the two levels constituting the reference transition and to the fourth power in temperature .",

    "the danger for both neutral atoms and ions is that ac electric fields may be present at the site of the atoms that otherwise go undetected .",
    "if one or both of the clock states has a quadrupole moment , shifts can arise due to ambient electric fields gradients which can be strong in ion traps .",
    "in several cases of interest , one of the clock states is an atomic d level which will have such an atomic quadrupole moment that can give rise to significant shifts . in the case of atomic ions",

    "shifts from collisions are typically dominated by electric field effects . since",
    "a precise theoretical description of these shifts is extremely complicated , experimentalists must typically calibrate them through measurements .",
    "this can be particularly important in neutral atom clocks where multiple atoms might be held in a common location and the shift is dominated by collisions between clock atoms .",
    "in this situation scattering cross sections will strongly differ between fermionic and bosonic clock atom species .",
    "this is not an issue for ions , which are well separated in the trap .",

    "[ sec : clocksinspace ] .",
    "as we have seen in the previous sections , a key ingredient of the optical atomic clock is an optical resonance with a high quality factor .",
    "since the resonance results from light - atom interaction , both the light used to drive the atomic transition and the atomic states being driven must be highly coherent to achieve a high-@xmath22 transition .",
    "lasers are traditionally viewed as exceptionally coherent sources of optical radiation . however , relative to the optical coherence afforded by the exceedingly narrow electronic transitions between metastable states of an optical clock , most lasers are far too incoherent .",
    "for this reason , a critical component of optical clock development is laser stabilization for generating highly phase coherent and frequency stable optical sources .",
    "a simple laser consists merely of an optical gain medium located inside a resonant optical cavity .",
    "the frequency of the laser is derived from the cavity resonance frequency where the laser gain is high .",
    "the output frequency is susceptible to a variety of noise processes involving the gain medium , optical path length changes , other intracavity elements , and amplified spontaneous emission .",
    "such noise processes limit the temporal coherence of the laser , typically well below the needed coherence time required for high resolution spectroscopy of the optical clock transition . in practice ,",
    "a much more well - defined resonant frequency can be realized with a properly designed passive optical cavity , typically a simple two - mirror fabry - prot interferometer .",
    "a laser s frequency can be stabilized to such an optical resonance , yielding highly coherent optical radiation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "to do so successfully , two important criteria must be met .",
    "first , the laser output must be tightly stabilized to the cavity resonance .",
    "this requires the ability to detect the cavity resonance with a large signal - to - noise ratio , together with the ability to adjust the laser frequency sufficiently fast to cancel the laser noise processes as they are detected with the optical cavity .",
    "high bandwidth phase and frequency actuation is achieved using electro- and acousto - optic devices , intra - laser piezoelectric - transducers , diode laser current control , and more .",
    "many detection schemes exist , but the most widely utilized for high performance laser stabilization is the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) technique .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the literature @xcite for details on this popular scheme .",
    "here we simply point out that pdh stabilization utilizes the laser field reflected from the optical reference cavity to detect resonance .",
    "the detection is performed at rf frequencies , by frequency modulating the incident laser field , and detecting the heterodyne beat between the optical carrier , in resonance with the cavity , and the fm sidebands , which are off - resonance and reflected by the cavity .",
    "this rf signal can then be demodulated to yield a signal well - suited for feedback control of the laser frequency to track the cavity resonance .",
    "the modulation frequency can be chosen at sufficiently high frequencies where technical laser amplitude noise is below the photon shot noise .",
    "the modulation scheme , frequently employing an electro - optic phase modulator , can be designed to minimize unwanted residual amplitude modulation that contaminates the cavity resonance signal @xcite .",
    "intuitively , an optical cavity with a narrower resonance can more sensitively detect laser frequency excursions .",
    "for this reason , high performance laser stabilization typically employs mirrors with very high reflectivity , achieving a cavity finesse approaching @xmath117 .",
    "since pdh stabilization can be used to tightly lock a laser s frequency to the resonant frequency of an optical cavity , the second important criterium for achieving a highly coherent laser source is to ensure that the cavity resonant frequency is stable and immune or isolated from noise sources which cause resonance frequency changes .",
    "since cavity resonance is achieved for mirror spacing at half - integer multiples of the laser wavelength , the essential detail is to maintain exceptionally stable mirror spacing .",
    "the mirrors are optically contacted to a mechanically - rigid spacer , whose primary function is to hold the mirror spacing constant .",
    "highly rigid spacer materials and mechanical isolation from ambient vibration sources help limit changes in the cavity length . properly chosen design of mechanical support of the cavity spacer and its shape",
    "can limit the effect of cavity length changes due to acceleration - driven deformation of the cavity spacer and mirrors @xcite .",
    "the spacer and mirrors are typically fabricated with materials ( such as ultra - low - expansion ( ule ) glass or low expansion glass - ceramics ) to limit thermal drifts of the cavity length , and sometimes employ special design or material selection to further reduce thermally - driven drifts @xcite .",
    "the cavity is held in a temperature - stabilized , shielded vacuum system , to thermally isolate the cavity from its environment and to reduce index of refraction fluctuations inside the cavity @xcite .",
    "laser power incident on the cavity is typically limited and stabilized , in order to reduce heating noise from residual absorption by the mirrors @xcite .",
    "the most fundamental noise source stems from thermo - mechanical noise of the cavity spacer , the mirror substrates , and the optical coating  @xcite . to reduce its influence",
    ", cavities sometimes employ special design considerations , including long spacers @xcite , mirror substrates made from high mechanical @xmath22 materials @xcite , or cryogenic cooling @xcite .",
    "the more recent work has emphasized on the use of crystal materials to construct the cavity spacer and substrates  @xcite , and even the optical coating @xcite .",
    "an all - crystalline optical cavity has the prospect of stabilizing laser frequency to a small fraction of @xmath118 , allowing further advances in clock stability and accuracy .",
    "spectral analysis for these advanced stable lasers can be directly accomplished with clock atoms  @xcite .",
    "laser stabilization to optical cavities exploit narrow optical resonances detected with a high signal - to - noise ratio . while cavities have historically been the most successful choice of optical resonance used for high - bandwidth laser stabilization , other systems can be used , including spectral hole burning in @xcite , some atomic or molecular resonances ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and optical - fiber delay lines @xcite .",
    "once a coherent optical wave is generated , it must be transmitted to the atomic system for spectroscopy , to an optical frequency comb for counting or linking to other optical or microwave frequency standards , or to other destinations in or outside the laboratory .",
    "this can be done through free space or through optical fiber . in either case ,",
    "a variety of perturbing effects ( e.g. thermal , acoustic , vibrational ) can re - introduce frequency noise with deleterious effects on the laser coherence that has been so carefully realized .",
    "for this reason , techniques for the transfer of coherent optical ( or microwave ) signals without the addition of noise are vital  @xcite .",
    "@xcite highlight optical techniques for the distribution of coherent signals , including microwave signals modulated on an optical carrier , coherent optical carrier transfer , and low - jitter transfer of the fs - pulses of an optical frequency comb",
    ". a basic feature of these techniques is measurement of the additional noise introduced via transfer , followed by noise cancelation by writing the anti - noise onto the transmitted signal . a popular technique for coherent optical carrier phase transfer exploits a heterodyne michelson interferometer to measure the added noise and a fast - actuating acousto - optic modulator to cancel it  @xcite .",
    "noise - canceled transfer of a cw - laser plays a prominent role in optical clock measurements and comparisons .",
    "first realized within the laboratory at the ten meter scale @xcite , it has now been extended to much longer distances , from many kilometers to hundreds of kilometers and beyond  @xcite .",
    "while transfer of an optical frequency signal through one kilometer of fiber would typically limit the transferred signal instability to worse than @xmath119 at one second , proper implementation of noise cancelation techniques can preserve signal stability to below @xmath120 at one second  @xcite .",
    "transfer is conveniently achieved over fiber networks , although free - space propagation has been investigated  @xcite with promising potential .",
    "fiber network transfer has been used for high performance comparisons of optical frequency standards @xcite , low - noise distribution of microwave signals or for high accuracy absolute frequency measurements @xcite , and high performance remote timing synchronization @xcite .      for many years",
    ", the benefits of atomic frequency standards operating at optical frequencies were outweighed by the difficulty of measuring the very high optical frequencies . except for measurements between optical standards operating at very similar frequencies , comparison among and",
    "measurement of optical standards was difficult , as evidenced by the complexity of optical frequency chains ( e.g.  @xcite ) . within the past 15 years",
    ", the development of the optical frequency comb has made optical frequency measurement relatively straightforward @xcite . with the pioneers of this technique rewarded by the 2005 nobel prize in physics @xcite , these optical measurements",
    "are now made regularly with amazing precision in laboratories around the world .",
    "furthermore , these optical combs have demonstrated the ability to phase coherently distribute an optical frequency throughout the optical spectrum , and even to the microwave domain .",
    "( a ) in the time domain , the laser output generates fs pulse - width envelopes separated in time by @xmath121 .",
    "another important degree of freedom is the phase difference between the envelope maximum and the underlying electric field oscillating at the carrier optical frequency .",
    "( b ) by fourier transformation to the frequency domain , the corresponding frequency comb spectrum is revealed .",
    "each tooth in the comb , a particular single frequency mode , is separated from its neighbor by @xmath122 .",
    "the relative carrier - envelope phase in the time domain is related to the offset frequency @xmath123 in the frequency domain .",
    "@xmath123 is given by the frequency of one mode of the comb ( e.  g.  @xmath124 ) modulo @xmath122 , and can be measured and stabilized with a f-2f interferometer . in this interferometer ,",
    "one comb mode , @xmath124 , is frequency doubled and heterodyne beat with the comb mode at twice the frequency , @xmath125 .",
    "thus , by stabilizing @xmath123 and @xmath122 to a well known frequency reference , each comb mode frequency is well known .",
    "measurement of the frequency of a poorly known optical frequency source ( e.  g.  previously measured at the resolution of a wavemeter ) can be determined by measuring the heterodyne beat between the frequency source and the frequency comb.,width=336 ]    the optical frequency comb outputs laser pulses with temporal widths at the fs timescale and with a repetition rate of millions or billions of pulses per second .",
    "the advent of few - cycle lasers with a few femtosecond pulse width , where ultrafast kerr - lens mode - locking mechanism ensures phase locking of all modes in the spectrum , along with the spectral broadening via microstructured fibers , have greatly facilitated the development of wide bandwidth optical frequency combs and their phase stabilization .",
    "as in fig .",
    "[ figcomb ] , the frequency and phase properties of this pulse train are given by two degrees of freedom : the relative phase between the carrier wave and the pulse envelope ( known as the carrier envelope offset ) , and the pulse repetition rate . applying a fourier transform to this pulse train , the laser output consists of a comb of many single frequency modes .",
    "the mode spacing is given by the laser repetition rate , and the spectral range covered by the frequency comb is related to the temporal width of each pulse . the frequency of each comb mode is given as a multiple of the mode spacing ( @xmath122 ) plus a frequency offset ( @xmath123 ) which is related to the carrier envelope phase offset  @xcite .",
    "control of these two rf frequencies yields control over the frequency of every comb mode @xcite . if these frequencies are stabilized to an accurate reference ( caesium ) , the optical frequency of a cw - laser or optical frequency standard can be determined by measuring the heteroydne beat between the comb and optical standard .",
    "a coarse , independent measurement of the unknown laser frequency using a commercially available wavelength meter allows one to determine which comb mode , @xmath34 , makes the heterodyne beat with the laser . the laser frequency",
    "is then determined straightforwardly by @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the measured heterodyne beat frequency and the @xmath77 is determined by whether the comb mode or the unknown laser is at higher frequency . in this way",
    ", optical standards can be measured against caesium microwave standards .",
    "furthermore , by stabilizing the comb frequency directly to an optical standard , the comb allows direct comparison of optical standards at different frequencies within the spectral coverage of the comb  @xcite .",
    "these measurements can be made at the stability of the optical standards themselves , without being limited by the lower stability of most microwave standards .",
    "the fs comb , using now standard laboratory techniques , thus enables microwave - to - optical , optical - to - microwave , and optical - to - optical phase - coherent measurement and distribution at the precision level slightly better than the current best atomic clocks  @xcite .",
    "all optical frequency standards that have been realized with cooled and trapped atoms are of the passive type , i.e. the oscillator of the standard is not the atomic reference itself , but a laser source whose output frequency is stabilized to the atomic signal .",
    "a further common feature of these standards is that the requirements of initial cooling and state preparation of the atoms lead to an operation in a cyclic sequence of interrogations and measurements .",
    "this is in contrast to established atomic clocks like caesium clocks with a thermal atomic beam and hydrogen masers , that provide a continuous signal . in the optical frequency standard",
    ", the laser has to serve as a flywheel that bridges the intervals when no frequency or phase comparison with the atoms is possible .",
    "its intrinsic frequency stability , the method for interrogating the atoms , and the use of the atomic signal for the frequency stabilization need to be considered together in the overall system design of the frequency standard . in this section",
    "we will discuss generic features of the methods and techniques that are applied for these purposes .",
    "the repetitive operation cycle of an optical frequency standard with cooled and trapped atoms consists of three distinct stages during which the following operations are performed : ( i ) cooling and state preparation , ( ii ) interrogation , ( iii ) detection and signal processing .    for a clock with neutral atoms , the first phase comprises loading of a magneto optical trap or of an optical dipole trap from an atomic vapor or from a slow atomic beam . in the case of trapped ions ,",
    "the same particles are used for many cycles , but some doppler or sideband laser cooling is necessary to counteract heating from the interaction of the ion with fluctuating electric fields .",
    "the conditions that are applied during this trapping and cooling phase include inhomogenous magnetic fields and resonant laser radiation on dipole - allowed transitions .",
    "this leads to frequency shifts of the reference transition that can not be tolerated during the subsequent interrogation phase .",
    "the first phase of the clock cycle is concluded with preparation of the initial lower - energy state of the clock transition by means of optical pumping into the selected hyperfine and magnetic sublevel .",
    "depending on the loading and cooling mechanism , this phase takes a time ranging from a few ms to a few hundred ms .    before starting the interrogation ,",
    "all auxiliary fields that would lead to a frequency shift of the reference transition need to be extinguished .",
    "resonant lasers that are used for cooling or optical pumping are usually blocked by mechanical shutters because the use of acousto - optic or electro - optic modulators alone does not provide the necessary extinction ratio .",
    "a time interval of a few ms is typically required to ensure the reliable closing of these shutters .    during the interrogation phase , radiation from the reference laser",
    "is applied to the atom . in an optimized system",
    ", the duration of this phase determines the fourier - limited spectral resolution or line @xmath22 of the frequency standard .",
    "provided that the duration of the interrogation is not limited by properties of the atomic system , i.e. decay of the atomic population or coherence or heating of the atomic motion , it is set to the maximum value that is possible before frequency or phase fluctuations of the reference laser start to broaden the detected line shape . for a reference laser that is stabilized to a cavity with an instability @xmath128 limited by thermal noise to about @xmath129 around 1  s , a suitable duration of the interrogation interval is several 100  ms up to 1  s , resulting in a fourier - limited linewidth of about 1  hz .    referring to pioneering work on molecular beams in the 1950s @xcite",
    ", one distinguishes between rabi excitation with a single laser pulse and ramsey excitation with two pulses that are separated by a dark interval . in ramsey spectroscopy",
    ", the two levels connected by the reference transition are brought into a coherent superposition by the first excitation pulse and the atomic coherence is then allowed to evolve freely . after the second excitation pulse the population in one of the levels is detected , which shows the effect of the interference of the second pulse with the time - evolved superposition state .",
    "assuming that the total pulse area is set to @xmath130 on resonance , rabi excitation possesses the advantage of working with lower laser intensity , leading to less light shift during the excitation .",
    "ramsey excitation , on the other hand , provides a narrower fourier - limited linewidth for the same interrogation time .",
    "if the duration of the excitation pulses is much shorter than the dark interval , ramsey excitation keeps the atoms in a coherent superposition of ground and excited states that is most sensitive to laser phase fluctuations  with the bloch vector precessing in the equatorial plane  for a longer fraction of the interrogation time than rabi excitation .",
    "generalizations of the ramsey scheme with additional pulses permit one to reduce shifts and broadening due to inhomogeneous excitation conditions or shifts that are a result of the excitation itself .",
    "an  echo ",
    "@xmath130-pulse during the dark period may be used to rephase an ensemble of atoms that undergoes inhomogoenous dephasing @xcite .",
    "an example of such an excitation - related shift is the light shift and its influence may readily be observed in the spectrum obtained with ramsey excitation  @xcite : the position and shape of the envelope reflects the excitation spectrum resulting from one of the pulses , whereas the ramsey fringes result from coherent excitation with both pulses and the intermediate dark period .",
    "the fringes are less shifted than the envelope , because their shift is determined by the time average of the intensity .",
    "a sequence of three excitation pulses with suitably selected frequency- and phase steps can be used to cancel the light shift and to efficiently suppress the sensitivity of the spectroscopic signal to variations of the probe light intensity  @xcite . while rabi excitation",
    "is often used in optical frequency standards because of its experimental simplicity , these examples show that the greater flexibility of ramsey excitation may provide specific benefits .",
    "after the application of the reference laser pulses , the clock cycle is concluded by the detection phase . in most cases , the atomic population after an excitation attempt is determined by applying laser radiation to induce resonance fluorescence on a transition that shares the lower state with the reference transition .",
    "this scheme was proposed by dehmelt and is sometimes called electron shelving @xcite . in the single - ion case , the absence of fluorescence indicates population of the upper state and the presence of fluorescence population of the lower state .",
    "the method implies an efficient quantum amplification mechanism , where the absorption of a single photon can be read out as an absence of many fluorescence photons .",
    "it is therefore also advantageously used for large atomic ensembles .",
    "if the number of photons detected from each atom is significantly greater than @xmath131 , photon shot - noise becomes negligible in comparison to the atomic projection noise .",
    "a disadvantage of the scattering of multiple fluorescence photons is that it destroys the induced coherence on the reference transition and that it even expels trapped neutral atoms from an optical lattice . in a lattice clock",
    "this makes it necessary to reload the trap with atoms for each cycle . since the loading and cooling phase takes a significant fraction of the total cycle time , reusing the same cold atoms would permit a faster sequence of interrogations , thereby improving the frequency stability .",
    "this can be realized in a non - destructive measurement that detects the atomic state not via absorption but via dispersion as a phase shift induced on a weak off - resonant laser beam  @xcite .",
    "if in addition to observing the same atoms , as it is the case with trapped ions , the internal coherence could also be maintained from one interrogation cycle to the next , a gain in stability can be obtained .",
    "if the atomic phase can be monitored over many cycles without destroying it , the frequency instability would average with @xmath132 like for white phase noise , instead of @xmath133 as for white frequency noise in a conventional atomic clock .",
    "such an atomic phase lock has been analyzed and an experimental realization proposed based on a measurement of faraday rotation with trapped ions  @xcite and for a dispersive interaction in a generic clock  @xcite .      in the atomic population measurement described above",
    ", noise may arise from fluctuations in the absolute atom number @xmath34 and in the atomic population distribution .",
    "for the frequency standards with cold trapped ions , @xmath34 is unity or a small number that is controlled in the beginning of each cycle , so that fluctuations are eliminated .",
    "if new atoms are loaded for each cycle from a reservoir , one may expect relative variations in the atom number @xmath134 . since fluorescence detection permits to measure the atom number in each cycle , however , signals may be normalized to the atom number , so that the contribution from atom number fluctuations to the instability of the frequency standard scales as @xmath135 , where the first term accounts for shot noise during detection of @xmath136 photons and the second term accounts for fluctuations in the atom number between cycles @xcite .",
    "sometimes the most severe noise contribution comes from quantum noise in the state measurement : physical measurement of a quantum system can be modeled by a hermitian operator acting on the wave function of the system being measured , and the result of that measurement is an eigenvalue of the operator .",
    "thus , measurement of a superposition of eigenstates yields one of the corresponding eigenvalues , a statistical outcome given by the superposed weighting of the eigenstates .",
    "this implies measurement fluctuation as the wavefunction collapses into a projection along a particular eigen - basis .",
    "let us consider the simple case of a single ion .",
    "the two levels that are connected by the reference transition are denoted as @xmath0 and @xmath1 and it is assumed that the ion is initially prepared in the lower state @xmath0 . after an excitation attempt the ion generally will be in a superposition state @xmath30 and the measurement with the electron shelving scheme is equivalent to determining the eigenvalue @xmath137 of the projection operator @xmath138 . if no fluorescence is observed ( the probability for this outcome being @xmath139 ) the previous excitation attempt is regarded successful ( @xmath140 ) , whereas the observation of fluorescence indicates that the excited state was not populated ( @xmath141 ) . in one measurement cycle only one binary unit of spectroscopic information is obtained . under conditions where the average excitation probability @xmath37 is @xmath142 ,",
    "the result of a sequence of cycles is a random sequence of zeros and ones and the uncertainty in a prediction on the outcome of the next cycle is always maximal .",
    "these population fluctuations and their relevance in atomic frequency standards were first discussed by itano et al . , who named the phenomenon quantum projection noise ( qpn ) @xcite .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the variance of the projection operator is given by @xcite @xmath143 for @xmath34 uncorrelated atoms , the variance is @xmath34-times bigger . for atoms with correlated state vectors , so - called spin squeezed states @xcite , the variance can be smaller than this value , allowing for frequency measurements with improved stability @xcite ( see sec .

    "the frequency of the reference laser needs to be stabilized to the atomic reference transition .",
    "in most cases , the error signal for the frequency lock is derived by modulating the laser frequency around the atomic resonance and by measuring the resulting modulation of the frequency - dependent excitation probability @xmath37 to the upper atomic level . with a cyclic operation imposed already by the requirements of laser cooling and state preparation ,",
    "the frequency modulation may be realized conveniently by interrogating the atoms with alternating detuning below and above resonance in subsequent cycles .",
    "the value of the detuning will be chosen in order to obtain the maximum slope of the excitation spectrum , and is typically close to the half linewidth of the atomic resonance .",
    "suppose the laser oscillates at a frequency @xmath16 , close to the center of the reference line .",
    "a sequence of @xmath144 cycles is performed in which the atoms are interrogated alternately at the frequency @xmath145 and at @xmath146 .",

    "laser frequency drift rates @xmath164 in the range from mhz / s up to hz / s are typically observed . for a first - order integrating servo with time constant @xmath165 , an average drift - induced error @xmath166 is expected as the result of a constant linear drift .",

    "we emphasize the excellent agreement between various measurements made in different laboratories around the world , indicating the ability of the lattice clock to serve as an accurate optical frequency standard .",
    "in fact , as we will see in the next section , the agreement in these measurements has allowed the international comparison to provide a useful constraint on variation of fundamental constants .",
    "both the sr and yb standards have now been recommended as secondary representations of the si second .",
    "with the rapid progress and high performance levels of optical clocks , two natural questions arise . what will the primary impacts of these advanced timekeepers be , and can they get even better ?",
    "we explore these questions , beginning with the definition of time and frequency itself .",
    "we consider the role of atomic clocks in the measurement of fundamental physics as an important field that these clocks have benefitted and will continue to benefit .",
    "we also look at quantum control techniques which may ultimately benefit the optical clock , and how these clocks continue to benefit our study of quantum systems .",
    "finally , we conclude by considering atomic clocks which operate at the very highest optical frequencies and beyond .      international atomic time ( tai ) and coordinated universal time ( utc )",
    "are maintained and disseminated by the time , frequency and gravimetry section of the bureau international des poids et mesures ( bipm ) in paris @xcite .",
    "they are the result of worldwide cooperation of about 70 national metrology laboratories and astronomical observatories that operate atomic clocks of different kinds .",
    "each participating laboratory k realizes an approximation to utc , denoted utc(k ) , which is used as the reference for local clock comparisons and frequency distribution .",
    "time transfer between the laboratories is performed by comparing local clocks to the time information received from the satellites of global navigation systems and via dedicated two - way links on geostationary telecommunication satellites . in this way",
    ", the differences between the utc(k ) time scales can be established with a transfer uncertainty that reaches less than 1  ns for well calibrated links .    a large ensemble of about 400 clocks , mainly commercial caesium clocks and hydrogen masers ,",
    "are reported to bipm and are averaged to obtain the time scale echelle atomique libre ( eal ) .",
    "the used algorithm is designed to provide a reliable scale with optimized frequency stability for a selected averaging time , assigning statistical weights to individual clocks based on their performance during the last 12 months .",
    "the frequency instability of eal reaches about @xmath281 over 30 to 40 days . in a second step ,",
    "measurements of primary caesium clocks made over the previous one year period are introduced to calculate the relative departure of the second of the free atomic time scale from the si second as realized by the primary clocks . by application of a gentle frequency steering which should not compromise the intrinsic stability of eal",
    ", the free scale is transformed into an accurate atomic time scale tai ( temps atomique international ) .",
    "presently , 11 atomic fountains in 8 laboratories contribute regularly to the calibration of tai and a frequency uncertainty of about @xmath282 is obtained .",
    "several more primary caesium clocks are under development worldwide .",
    "utc is finally derived from tai after the addition of leap seconds .",
    "these are introduced at irregular intervals , following the convention to maintain utc in agreement to within 0.9  s with an astronomical time scale defined by earth s rotation @xcite the dissemination of utc by the bipm takes the form of a time series of [ utc - utc(k ) ] for selected dates in the past month .    with the rapid improvement in the development of optical frequency standards , it has been demonstrated that the accuracies of a number of systems now surpass those of primary caesium standards .",
    "the direct comparison of two optical frequency standards can be performed with lower uncertainty than the si second is realized .",
    "this calls in the long term for a redefinition of the second in terms of an atomic transition frequency in the optical range .",
    "in order to approach this change and to introduce novel frequency standards into metrological use , the concept of  secondary representations of the second  has been defined @xcite .",
    "a formal procedure has been established of taking note of measurements of transition frequencies in atoms and ions relative to the caesium frequency standard and of the pertinent uncertainty evaluations . as the result of an evaluation in 2012 , seven values for optical transition frequencies in the atoms @xmath63sr and @xmath258yb and in the ions @xmath86al@xmath57 , @xmath56sr@xmath57 , @xmath258yb@xmath57 ( two transitions ) , and @xmath259hg@xmath57",
    "have been recommended with uncertainties in the range @xmath283 .",
    "obviously , the uncertainty of the recommended si frequency value can never be lower than those of the best available primary frequency standard . in the microwave range ,",
    "the ground - state hyperfine transition frequency of @xmath63rb has been recommended with an uncertainty of @xmath284 .",
    "measurements with a rubidium fountain @xcite are now reported in comparison to tai regularly , and in principle data from optical frequency measurements could also be used , as has been demonstrated in a retrospective exercise already @xcite . from such comparisons",
    "one can assess whether the reproducibilities of the new standards between successive periods of operation are in agreement with their stated uncertainties .",
    "if this is verified , they could constitute very valuable sources for the monitoring and steering of tai , even if their full intrinsic uncertainty can not be immediately used since they realize only secondary representations .",
    "to benefit fully from performance of optical frequency standards for the realization of time scales requires significant improvements in time transfer and in technology for flywheel frequency standards that are needed to handle dead time @xcite .",
    "continuous operations of optical atomic clocks for periods of several days have been established in several laboratories . however , since these systems involve a number of lasers including optical frequency combs , and laser cooled and trapped atoms and ions , the reliability of their operations is still being gradually improved .",
    "advances in timekeeping impact a variety of applications .",
    "atomic clocks are a critical component in global navigation satellite systems ( gnss ) , mature advanced atomic clocks based on optical transitions and/or laser cooled atomic / ionic samples could be used to improve navigation and timekeeping capabilities . at short timescales gnss",
    "are not currently limited by the atomic clock stability , but by atmospheric disturbances which would need to be mitigated to take full advantage of the performance discussed here . however",
    ", gnss systems could already benefit from the superb long term stability provided by high performance clocks as the ultra - low drift would allow significantly extended operation between updates or re - synchronization , compared to currently deployed rb vapor cell clocks .",
    "the improved stability would translate to improved gnss system integrity , enabling autonomous operation within given acceptable position ranging errors for timescales of days or weeks , instead of hours .",
    "applications which can benefit from improved system integrity include precision airplane approaches at airports  @xcite .",
    "advanced clocks will also be needed onboard deep space missions to aid in navigation and timekeeping .",
    "deep space navigation is usually implemented by doppler velocimetry and ranging in a two - way configuration .",
    "stable clocks on board of spacecrafts would allow a down - link - only operation with significantly better accuracy and coverage of spacecraft observation @xcite .",
    "other applications which are poised to benefit from next generation clocks include radar , where the improved short term stability results in ultra - low phase noise microwaves for high resolution and extended dwell times , similarly radio - astronomy using synthetic aperture techniques , and communication networks . optical frequency synthesis using optical clock and",
    "comb architecture will enable on - demand coherent frequency generation for academic and industry applications .",
    "in addition , the optical clock technology platform parallels that of emerging inertial sensor technology based on atom interferometry , and advances in one field can be incorporated into and benefit the other .",
    "common tools for these systems include frequency stabilized lasers , ultra high vacuum systems , and low noise electronics .",
    "atomic sensors using this toolbox include absolute gravimeters and gravity gradiometers , which have applications in geophysical monitoring and research , as well as oil and mineral exploration and gravity aided navigation .",
    "gyroscope configurations show promise for inertial navigation systems , and may enable high performance navigation in sea and space environments where gnss is not available .      according to general relativity , a clock ticks slower in a gravitational potential compared to a clock outside of it . the corresponding fractional frequency difference between the clocks",
    "is given by @xmath285 , where @xmath286 is the gravitational potential difference between the positions of the clocks and @xmath287 their frequency difference . on earth , the gradient of the gravitational potential results in a fractional frequency change of approximately @xmath288 per meter height difference for a clock at rest . by combining the gravity potential provided by optical clocks and its derivative ( the gravity field ) as measured by gravimeters",
    ", one can estimate the size and location of a density anomaly  @xcite , an important application in earth exploration .",
    "when comparing two clocks at different locations , relativistic time dilation from the rotation of the earth and higher - order general relativistic corrections need to be taken into account @xcite and for contributions to international time scales by referencing the clocks to a well - defined reference geopotential @xcite . the equipotential surface of this geopotential ( gravitational plus centrifugal components ) closest to mean sea level is called the geoid and corresponds to a water surface at rest .",
    "the height above the geoid defines an orthometric height system in geodesy , closely approximating equipotential surfaces .",
    "geopotential differences tell us in which direction water flows .",
    "this has important applications in coastal protection , engineering , and water resource management .",
    "currently , heights within a country are determined through geometric leveling with theodolites supported by local gravimetry along leveling lines .",
    "this is performed in loops with a total length of more than 30,000  km for a country such as germany with an area of 360,000  km@xmath243 .",
    "establishing such a leveling network with typical single - setup distances of around 50  m is a time - consuming and costly task .",
    "most importantly , errors in single measurements accumulate , compromising the overall height system to an accuracy of a few centimeters within a country .",
    "an alternative approach uses accurate gnss ( global navigation satellite system ) data together with gravity field modelling from satellite gravimetry supported by terrestrial gravimetry , which in principle is capable to extend height systems across continents @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that gnss only provides geometrical heights above an ellipsoid .",
    "different approaches to obtain the height above the geoid produce height deviations of several tens of centimeters and disagree with purely terrestrial measurements @xcite . a conceptually new and independent method to overcome these limitations and simplify the connection between height systems",
    "is `` relativistic geodesy '' or `` chronometric leveling '' , which allows long - distance potential difference measurements @xcite .",
    "it is based on a frequency comparison between two remote optical clocks via optical fibers ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : distribution ] or free - space microwave @xcite or optical @xcite satellite links to provide a direct height difference measurement between two remote locations .",
    "alternatively , a mobile clock ( operating during transport ) together with careful modeling of its speed and geopotential trajectory can be used .",
    "geodesy and frequency metrology are inextricably linked : a remote frequency comparison probes the accuracy of clocks _ and _ the geodetic model simultaneously , since the height difference between the clocks enters the systematic uncertainty evaluation of the frequency standard @xcite .",
    "therefore , relativistic geodesy should be performed using high performance transportable optical clocks .",
    "these can be calibrated through side - by - side measurements with the reference clock before being transported to a remote site for a geopotential comparison .",
    "furthermore , this approach would relax the requirements of the uncertainty evaluation of the involved frequency standards and thus improve the height resolution . instead of performing an evaluation of the _ accuracy _ of the clock , one would evaluate its _",
    "reproducibility_. it allows the clock to have a less precisely known but constant shift from its unperturbed transition frequency .",
    "the frequency uncertainty in terms of reproducibility is the uncertainty in keeping the shifts constant , without knowing their exact magnitude .",
    "an example is the black - body radiation shift discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ionbbr ] .",
    "the uncertainty of the shift has two contributions : i ) the uncertainty in the differential atomic polarizability and ii ) the uncertainty in the radiation field experienced by the atoms , usually characterized by an effective temperature .",
    "if we assume the polarizability ( as an atomic parameter ) to have a well - defined and constant value , we can neglect its uncertainty in the uncertainty evaluation for a reproducible clock .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the uncertainty in the electric field determination which may fluctuate between frequency comparisons .",
    "the same argument relaxes the requirements on the evaluation of many other uncertainty contributions .",
    "a world - encompassing network of optical clocks operating at a level of @xmath49 with a suitable infrastructure for high - level frequency comparison would not only provide a more accurate time standard , but also form the basis for a unified , long - term stable geodetic height reference frame @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the accuracy of clocks on earth will be limited by the knowledge of the local gravity potential . a master clock in space on a sufficiently well - known orbit",
    "@xcite would eliminated this issue and provide a gravitationally unperturbed signal . at the same time , such a `` master clock '' in space @xcite would enable high - stability time and frequency transfer between earth - bound clocks using microwave @xcite or optical links @xcite to establish a unified world height system .      optical clocks in space hold the promise of boosting the significance of tests of fundamental physics , in particular tests of einstein s theory of relativity and applications such as positioning , time and frequency transfer , and directly related to the latter , accurate geoid determination and monitoring  @xcite . most of these applications have been discussed in previous reviews  @xcite and in two space mission proposals involving optical clocks , namely the sagas ( search for anomalous gravitation using atomic sensors ) @xcite and the ege ( einstein gravity explorer ) @xcite projects .",
    "unfortunately , both missions have not been selected for implementation .",
    "however , they provide concrete mission scenarios and thus serve as baselines for space - borne tests with optical clocks .",
    "most importantly , for such missions to be successful in the future , a continued effort into the development of space - qualified ( trans)portable optical clocks is essential .",
    "the unification of all fundamental forces including gravity is a formidable task .",
    "such a quantum field theory of gravity should at some scale differ in its predictions from general and special relativity as developed by einstein .",
    "it is therefore important to devise experiments which probe relativity at different scales .",
    "the foundation of general relativity lies in the equivalence principle , comprising the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) , related to the universality of free fall , local lorentz invariance ( lli ) , related to velocity - dependent effects , and local position invariance ( lpi ) , related to the universality of the gravitational red shift . except for the universality of free fall , optical clocks on satellites in space can outperform terrestrial tests of these principles with only modest requirements on the clock performance , owing to the long unperturbed integration time in a space environment and the strong modulation in gravitational potential and velocity achievable on an appropriately chosen orbit .",
    "lpi tests come in two flavours : i ) absolute redshift measurements in which a terrestrial clock is compared to a clock in a spacecraft , and ii ) null redshift measurements or tests of the universality of the redshift in which two different types of clocks on board of the same spacecraft are compared . in both experiments the clock(s ) in the spacecraft are subject to a strongly varying gravity potential .",
    "any deviation from einstein s theory of relativity should manifest itself in a modulation of the frequency ratio between the clocks .",
    "the sagas project proposes to use an optical clock on board of a spacecraft on a solar system escape trajectory which is compared to a ground clock using an optical carrier link together with appropriate infrastructure to independently measure the spacecraft s velocity and acceleration @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the much larger variation in gravitational potential and the long mission duration results in an improvement by 4 orders of magnitude over the previous best test by gravity probe a @xcite .",
    "a similar improvement is expected from the ege project in which a satellite hosting an optical and a microwave clock revolves around the earth on a highly elliptical orbit @xcite .",
    "frequency comparisons between the onboard clocks and between the onboard and ground clocks using a microwave link provide null and absolute redshift measurements , respectively .",
    "these measurements can also be interpreted as a coupling of the fine - structure constant to the gravitational potential ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : constants ] ) .",
    "lli tests using clocks can be implemented by measuring the special relativistic time dilation effect scaling as @xmath289 ( ives - stilwell test ) for large velocities in the absence of strong gravitational potentials .",
    "such a test could be performed within the sagas mission scenario when the spacecraft will leave the solar system at high speed .",
    "the expected uncertainty of this test is at @xmath290 almost a factor of 30 smaller than the best terrestrial test to date @xcite . assuming a violation of lli in the form of a preferred frame of reference ( the cosmic microwave background ) through which the solar system races with a speed @xmath291 , the time dilation effect gets amplified to @xmath292 @xcite , which can be measured by sagas to a level of @xmath293 relative uncertainty , an improvement by almost two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "another test of lli is performed through kennedy - thorndike type experiments , in which the independence of the outcome of an experiment to the velocity with respect to a preferred frame is probed . such experiments probe the relation between time dilation and spatial lorentz contraction by comparing the frequency of an atomic standard with the resonance frequency of an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "the ege mission scenario predicts an improvement by a factor of 20 over the best terrestrial measurements owing to the large velocity changes during the highly elliptical orbit @xcite .",
    "parametrized post - newtonian gravity ( ppn ) describes metric theories of gravitation in the weak field limit using a set of parameters , which are zero for the case of newtonian gravity .",
    "one of the most important parameters is @xmath294 and describes the amount of curvature produced by a unit rest mass",
    ". a non - zero @xmath294 changes the delay suffered by light traversing a strong gravitational potential ( shapiro time delay ) compared to newtonian gravity and results in gravito - magnetic effects @xcite .",
    "this effect can be measured by spacecraft laser ranging during occultation . within the sagas mission proposal a measurement uncertainty of @xmath295",
    "is expected , limited by the onboard clock uncertainty .",
    "this corresponds to a two to four orders of magnitude improvement over previous results @xcite .    besides these fundamental physics applications , optical clocks in space could act as stable time and frequency servers and provide links for time and frequency transfer between continents to establish improved time scales and a well - defined height system using relativistic geodesy ( see sec .

    "sec : geodesy ] ) .      understanding how systems evolve in time is a key goal of many scientific theories or models , whether that system be a single atom or the entire universe .",
    "the ticking rate of an atomic clock is determined by the basic properties of sub - atomic particles and how they interact to form an atom .",
    "it depends on the most basic parameters , the fundamental constants of nature .",
    "as their name suggests , these fundamental constants are typically assumed to be fixed in value throughout space and time .",
    "however , if they varied , as some theories which seek to unify the fundamental forces predict , then so too does the ticking rate of an atomic clock . as such",
    ", atomic clocks serve as one of several vital tools to explore this possible variation through time , space , or through coupling to gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "atomic clocks complement astronomical and other measurements which instead sample possible variation over a large fraction of the history of the universe @xcite .",
    "atomic frequency standards , on the other hand , are locally operated on earth and are only useful for exploring fundamental constant variation during the time that they are operated for such measurements .",
    "presently , this is only on the timescale of years .",
    "however , meaningful measurements can be made due to the unmatched measurement precision and accuracy of atomic clocks .",
    "the atomic and molecular transitions at the heart of these standards can depend on fundamental constants such as the fine structure constant ( @xmath296 ) , the electron - proton mass ratio ( @xmath96 ) , and the light quark mass .",
    "as these clocks advance in measurement precision , their ability to constrain the fluctuations of these constants improves .",
    "optical clock transitions exhibit dependence on the fine structure constant through relativistic corrections to the transition frequency @xcite .",

    "thus , absolute frequency measurements of different species can be used to explore possible temporal variations of @xmath296 and @xmath96 .",
    "for example , the fractional frequency drift rate of the sr clock frequency measured against cs constrains a linear combination of the variations @xmath298 and @xmath299 in atomic units as @xmath300 sensitivity coefficients ( @xmath301 ) for various species have been calculated ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "notable among these are ion standards based on mercury or the octupole transition of ytterbium , @xmath307 and @xmath308 ( octupole ) .",
    "measurements of the transition frequencies of these clocks can be measured at different times , ideally over an interval of many years , and require comparisons among different clock species , ideally between clocks with varying sensitivity to fundamental constant variation ( e.g.  a clock with high sensitivity measured against one with low sensitivity , or two clocks with high sensitivity of opposite signs ) .",
    "observed drift rates can be extracted by linear fits to such data . from eq .",

    "they can be generated by implementing a nonlinear ramsey interferometer using generalized @xmath34-atom @xmath39 ramsey pulses , implementing a nonlinear rotation of the collective spin .",
    "the atoms in these states are quantum mechanically correlated in such a way that they act as a single , macroscopic quantum system with a phase evolution between the two components which is @xmath34 times faster compared to uncorrelated atoms , allowing heisenberg - limited resolution .",
    "the largest ghz states with high fidelity have been created in trapped ions systems using quantum phase gates @xcite .",
    "this way , two @xcite , three @xcite , six @xcite and 14 @xcite entangled atoms and improved phase estimation have been demonstrated .",
    "the latest experiment by the innsbruck group is particularly relevant here , since it is implemented on the optical clock transition of the ion .",
    "scaling the system to hundreds of ions in a penning trap has been proposed @xcite .",
    "implementation of ghz ramsey spectroscopy has also been proposed for a neutral atom optical lattice clock , where the ghz state is created through the on - site interaction of an atom movable across the lattice @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of the larger signal slope using ghz states is the concomitant increased sensitivity to laser phase noise @xcite , eliminating any stability enhancement of these maximally entangled states . by engineering more symmetric states with reduced @xmath335 , such as gaussian states",
    ", @xcite could show that a stability improvement by a factor of @xmath336 is achieved .",
    "@xcite analytically optimized measurement basis and input states to obtain heisenberg - limited scaling in the limit of large @xmath34 for similarly symmetric correlated states . in a numerical optimization approach",
    ", @xcite has shown that for realistic @xmath337 local oscillator noise with a flat allan deviation of 1  hz , for up to 15 ions the protocol by @xcite and for more ions the @xcite approach provides the best improvement over the sql , whereas ghz states perform even slightly worse than a standard ramsey experiment .",
    "short of better clock lasers , improved clock interrogation schemes can realize sub - sql instability .",
    "recently , such optimized measurement strategies based on a hierarchy of ensembles of clock atoms with increasing interrogation time have been proposed @xcite . in these schemes",
    "the phase noise of the laser is tracked and stabilized on time scales approaching the excited state lifetime of the clock atom through interrogation of several ensembles with successively longer probe times .",
    "this ensures a well - defined laser phase for the ensemble with the longest interrogation time and results in an exponential scaling of the instability with the number of atoms .",
    "quantum correlated spin states can either be used to reduce the required number of atoms in each ensemble or to further improve the instability , approaching heisenberg - limited scaling for an infinite number of atoms @xcite .",
    "current implementations of single ion clocks with their limited instability would benefit the most from these new schemes , requiring multi - ion traps tailored for metrological purposes @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "heisenberg scaling for improved clock stability remains an experimental challenge .",
    "phase noise of the lo prevents the clock stability from scaling as the hl .",
    "however , in scenarios with realistic noise models and taking into account the reduced performance of uncorrelated states in the presence of noise , partially entangled states can still lead to a significant improvement in stability @xcite .",
    "the full potential of entanglement - enhanced metrology can only be realized if analytical models for identifying the optimum states and measurement basis for complex noise models are developed .",
    "this goes hand in hand with the development of efficient protocols for creating these metrologically relevant states . from an experimental point of view",
    "entanglement - enhanced metrology is only worth the effort if either a simple scaling of the number of ( uncorrelated ) particles is technologically challenging as is the case for trapped ion systems @xcite , compromises the accuracy of the clock as is the case for density - related shifts in neutral atom lattice clocks , or where entanglement offers other added values , such as reduced systematic shifts .",
    "entanglement as a resource for spectroscopy and optical clocks is not limited to improved stability as outlined in the previous section .",
    "efficient schemes for creating entangled atomic states and protect them against environmental decoherence have been developed in the context of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "these techniques allow the creation of `` designer atoms '' consisting of two or more entangled atoms with engineered properties for spectroscopy @xcite . in a ground - breaking experiment ,",
    "@xcite have entangled two ions ( wavefunction indices @xmath131 and @xmath338 ) in a linear paul trap in first - order magnetic field insensitive states of the form @xmath339 with @xmath340 , where @xmath341 indicates the magnetic quantum number of the @xmath342 state .",
    "this construction ensures that each part of the wavefunction shifts the same way in a magnetic field .",
    "this idea can be further extended to engineer first - order magnetic - field- and electric - quadrupole - insensitive entangled states relevant for ion clocks .",
    "currently this goal is achieved by averaging six transitions to obtain a virtual clock transition free of these shifts .",
    "however , changes in the magnetic or electric fields between the interrogation of the different transitions would cause imperfect cancellation . using six entangled ions , the equivalent to averaging over these six transitions",
    "could be achieved in a single experiment .",
    "in addition to the insensitivity against external fields , the differential phase shift between the two parts of the wavefunction exhibits ghz - type scaling with an energy difference of @xmath343 .",
    "however , efficient schemes to produce such complex maximally entangled states are yet to be developed .      the lasers with best frequency stability currently have linewidths of @xmath344100 mhz  @xcite , and are limited by the thermal noise in the optical cavities that provide frequency stabilization .",
    "an alternative solution is to make a narrow laser using the same high-@xmath22 transitions used in optical lattice clocks .",
    "the atoms become spontaneously correlated , creating a collective atomic dipole that emits light whose phase stability directly reflects the phase stability of the atomic dipole  @xcite .",
    "we note also that passive schemes using ultranarrow atomic resonances enhanced with an optical cavity can take a similar advantage of atom correlations to realize excellent laser frequency stabilization @xcite",
    ". the continuous superradiant light source has never been demonstrated , and has the potential to produce laser - like light with linewidths approaching 1 mhz .",
    "the impact of mhz linewidth frequency references has the same potential to revolutionize the precision of clocks as has the development of optical frequency standards during the past decade .",
    "recently , a proof - of - principle experiment has been carried out using a raman transition in rb @xcite .    instead of relying on the coherence of the photons ,",
    "the continuous superradiant sources relies on the atomic coherence . in this approach",
    ", @xmath34 atoms trapped in an optical cavity spontaneously form a collective 1d polarization grating leading to collective and directional emission of photons into the cavity mode .",
    "the superradiant emission grows as @xmath345 , and occurs without the macroscopic buildup of photons within the cavity  @xcite .",
    "a key insight is that the system can be continuously repumped , an advance akin to moving from pulsed to continuous lasing .",
    "the second key insight is that the emitted light reflects the phase stability of the atomic polarization grating and that the coherence of the grating surpasses the single particle decoherence rate .",
    "the predicted linewidth of the light can be even less than the atomic linewidth , and the scaling is fundamentally different from the schawlow - townes laser linewidth .",
    "lastly , the requirements on the optical cavity are relaxed since the key parameter that must be made large is again the cavity - qed collective cooperativity parameter @xmath3461 , while the cooperativity parameter is preferably small @xmath3471 .",
    "the effort using @xmath63sr atoms has the potential to produce unprecedentedly narrow light approaching 1 mhz .",
    "the atoms would be trapped in a magic - wavelength optical lattice inside of a high finesse optical cavity ( finesse @xmath348 ) resonant with the clock transition @xmath108p@xmath349 to @xmath350s@xmath349 . for a 1 mm cavity length , and @xmath34 = @xmath351 ,",
    "the collective cooperativity is very large @xmath352 so that the superradiance threshold can be easily achieved .",
    "however , the small cooperativity @xmath353 , yields a predicted linewidth of the emitted light smaller than the 1 mhz transition linewidth .",
    "following superradiant decay to @xmath279 the atoms would be continuously repumped back to @xmath280 via the intermediate states @xmath354 and @xmath355 that also serves to provide raman sideband cooling .",
    "the continuous nature of the light emitted from the cavity would last for several seconds and would be limited only by losses from the optical lattice .",
    "emission could be made truly continuous by continuously reloading atoms into the optical lattice from the side .",
    "the 0.1 pw of generated optical power would be sufficient to stabilize the current 1 hz linewidth laser with a precision of 1mhz in a feedback bandwidth of @xmath3561 hz .",
    "the stability of current sr optical lattice clocks would be improved by a factor @xmath35710 should this proposed scheme succeed .",
    "one of the most exciting research directions for ultracold matter lies in the exploration of strongly correlated quantum many - body systems .",
    "optical lattice clocks have emerged as an surprising new platform for this endeavor .",
    "motivated by the desire to reduce the clock systematic uncertainty arising from atomic interactions , high resolution spectroscopy performed in optical lattice clocks has provided new insights and understandings of these effects .",
    "this effort in turn makes the lattice clocks well - suited for the study of many - body spin interactions . when the spectral resolving power of the clock laser advances to be better than atomic interactions in the clock , the seemingly weakly interacting spin system actually demonstrates strong correlations with complex excitation spectra  @xcite , and even su(n ) symmetry  @xcite",
    "can now be directly explored to study complex quantum systems with high degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "this is an exciting new research direction that builds on the advanced optical clock and will provide important guidelines for future advances of optical lattice clocks  @xcite .",
    "endowed with a number of attractive properties , ultracold group ii atoms provide new opportunities for quantum simulation and quantum information science  @xcite , leveraging on the efforts on optical manipulation , quantum engineering , clock - type precision measurement , and optical control of interactions  @xcite .",
    "the clean separation of internal and external degrees of freedom in an optical lattice clock system rivals that of ion - trap systems and is ideal for retaining quantum coherence for many trapped atoms , and for precise quantum measurement and manipulations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , even at the early stage of the lattice clock development , laser - atom interaction coherence time has been extended to hundreds of milliseconds  @xcite , and has been further improved with more stable lasers  @xcite .",
    "this high spectral resolution allows us to precisely control the electronic and nuclear spin configurations and to probe their interactions .",
    "specifically , we can use both the nuclear spin and long - lived electronic states ( @xmath279 and @xmath280 states ) to represent spins and orbitals in a quantum system .",
    "the two key features are the presence of a metastable excited state @xmath280 and the almost perfectly decoupled nuclear spin @xmath358 from the electronic angular momentum @xmath359 in these two states , because @xmath359 = 0 .",
    "the advantage of using pure nuclear spin states is that their coherence is largely insensitive to _ stray _ magnetic or electric fields in the laboratory , and yet they can still be effectively manipulated via strong and deliberately applied laser fields so that state - specific resonances can be controlled , even in a spatially resolved manner . in addition , by using the metastable electronic states to represent orbitals , one gains exceptional spectral selectivity to impose state - dependent optical forces on atoms in the lattice . as such , schemes for generating spin - dependent interactions , similar to those relevant for trapped ions or in the bilayer lattice , can be implemented  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it should also be possible to develop individual quantum bit addressability and readout using tomographic and site - resolved imaging techniques under applied inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "this spatial addressability and control are useful in several ways : 1 ) characteristics of the lattice may only be uniform in a small portion of the system , and this spatial addressing would allow the simulation to take place specifically and exclusively in that portion ; 2 ) the non - uniform lattice parameters can be compensated for with the spatial addressing ; 3 ) we can simulate non - uniform material systems , a capability of clear technological importance if aim to simulate materials for real world devices and that are thus deliberately shaped and crafted to specific tasks .",
    "a major advantage of the optical lattice clock with many atoms is the enhanced signal to noise ratio for spectroscopy and hence the improved clock stability .",
    "however , with atom  light coherence times reaching beyond one second , even very weak atomic interactions can give rise to undesired clock frequency shifts .",
    "this systematic uncertainty connects to many - body physics and is thus different from all other single - atom based effects .",
    "an interesting discovery in our push for ever increasing accuracy of the sr and yb lattice clocks is the interaction - induced frequency shift on the clock transition even with spin - polarized fermionic atoms prepared under ultralow temperatures , where atoms collide with a single or very few partial waves . for identical fermionic atoms , antisymmetrization of the two - particle wave function forbids the @xmath360-wave interaction , and the @xmath37-wave is suppressed owing to the centrifugal potential arising from an angular momentum of @xmath361 . after intensive research efforts focusing on the atomic density - related frequency shifts in both sr and yb systems , we have come to very good understandings of these effects and have since suppressed the density - dependent frequency shift below 1@xmath78 . the theory model developed by rey .",
    "has also become capable of describing full many - body spin - spin interaction dynamics well beyond a simple mean - field treatment  @xcite .",
    "the powerful spectroscopy resolution allows us to very effectively remove single - particle dephasing effects and reveal the underlying correlated spin dynamics .",
    "the decoupling between the electronic and nuclear spins implies that atomic scattering lengths involving states @xmath279 and @xmath280 are independent of the nuclear spin to very high precision .",
    "of course the nuclear spin wavefunction can be engineered to dictate how the two atoms interact electronically via antisymmetrization of the overall wavefunction for fermions .",
    "the resulting su(@xmath34 ) spin symmetry ( where @xmath34 = 2@xmath358 + 1 can be as large as 10 ) together with the possibility of combining ( nuclear ) spin physics with ( electronic ) orbital physics opens up an exciting research direction for rich many - body systems with alkaline - earth atoms  @xcite .      going to higher and higher operating frequencies has been a recurrent trend in the development of precise clocks and the present status of optical clocks clearly shows the benefits in terms of stability and accuracy that can be obtained in comparison to atomic clocks operating in the microwave range .",
    "it is therefore evident to consider to carry this development forward and to enter the domain of vacuum ultraviolet and soft x - ray radiation .",
    "candidates for suitable reference transitions may be sought in highly charged ions where the remaining electrons are tightly bound , and potentially in heavy nuclei where a few @xmath294-transitions are known at energies of 1  kev and below , that are untypically low on the nuclear energy scale .",
    "it has been pointed out that both types of transitions may offer considerable advantages in terms of field - induced systematic frequency shifts .",
    "comprehensive proposals have been developed for clocks based on nuclear transitions @xcite and on electronic transitions in highly charged ions @xcite .",
    "nuclear transition frequencies are generally several orders of magnitude higher than those of transitions in the electron shell and are also less sensitive to shifts induced by external electric or magnetic fields because the characteristic nuclear dimensions and nuclear moments are small compared to those of the shell .",
    "if the interrogation is not performed with a bare nucleus , one has to consider the coupling of the nuclear and electronic energy level systems through the hyperfine interactions .",
    "since the primary interest is in the nuclear transition , the choice of a suitable electronic configuration can be adapted to the experimental requirements . from general considerations",
    "it can be seen that for every radiative nuclear transition , an electronic state can be selected based on angular momentum quantum numbers such that the hyperfine coupled nuclear transition frequency becomes immune against field - induced shift to a degree that can not be obtained for an electronic transition .    in an @xmath362 coupling scheme",
    "the eigenstates of the coupled electronic and nuclear system are characterised by sets of quantum numbers @xmath363 , where @xmath358 denotes the nuclear spin , @xmath364 the orbital , spin and total electronic angular momenta , @xmath263 and @xmath261 the total atomic angular momentum and its orientation . @xmath296 and",
    "@xmath81 label the involved nuclear and electronic configurations .",
    "the choice of an integer total angular momentum @xmath263 ( so that a zeeman sublevel @xmath365 is available ) together with @xmath267 leads to vanishing of the linear zeeman effect , quadratic stark effect and quadrupole shift @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the optimal electronic states for the interrogation of the nuclear transition are those with @xmath366 in the case of a half integer nuclear spin , and @xmath367 if the nuclear spin is integer . alternatively , and more generally applicable also for higher values of @xmath359 , a pair of transitions between stretched hyperfine states @xmath368 can be used to realize a nuclear transition that is largely uncoupled from shifts in the electron shell @xcite .",
    "because of its favorably low transition energy of about 7.8  ev , the transition between the nuclear gound state and an isomeric state in @xmath369th @xcite is considered as the experimentally most accessible system for a nuclear clock and a number of experimental projects have been started to investigate this potential . for a high - precision nuclear clock ,",
    "the case of trapped @xmath369th@xmath370-ions seems to be especially promising because its electronic level structure is suitable for laser cooling @xcite .",
    "the sensitive detection of excitation to the isomeric state will be possible using a double resonance scheme that probes the hyperfine structure of a resonance transition in the electron shell , in analogy to electron shelving as applied in single - ion optical clocks on electronic transitions .    an alternative option for a nuclear optical optical clock with @xmath369th",
    "is based on the idea of performing laser mbauer spectroscopy with @xmath369th embedded in a crystal @xcite .",
    "while the systematic uncertainty of such a solid - state nuclear clock may not reach that of a realization with trapped and laser cooled ions , the potentially much larger number of nuclei may provide a frequency reference of high stability .",
    "the crystal field shifts of the nuclear resonance frequency will be dominantly due to electric fields and field gradients .",
    "a diamagnetic host with a lattice of high symmetry should be used .",
    "thermal motion will lead to a temperature - dependent broadening and shift of the nuclear line , where the line shape will depend on phonon frequencies and correlation times . for a solid state nuclear clock of high accuracy ( beyond @xmath371 )",
    "the temperature dependence may be eliminated if the crystal is cryogenically cooled to well below the debye temperature , so that the influence of phonons is effectively frozen out .    at higher nuclear transition energies",
    ", the methods envisaged here for @xmath369th will not be viable if radiative nuclear decay competes with the emission of conversion electrons , leading to changes of the charge state of the ion . in the case of trapped ions ,",
    "internal conversion can be suppressed by using a sufficiently high charge state with an ionization potential that lies above the nuclear excitation energy .",
    "laser cooling and state detection will then be performed using the methods developed for the trapped ion quantum logic clock .",
    "electronic transitions in highly charged ions also possess favorable properties as a reference for a highly accurate clock . in a positive ion of net charge",
    "@xmath372 the binding energy of a valence electron is proportional to @xmath373 . within an isoelectronic sequence , transition energies between bound states can be expected to follow a similar scaling , modified by contributions from qed and finite nuclear size . since the size of the electron cloud contracts with @xmath374 , size - dependent quantities like polarisabilities or electric quadrupole moments , that determine the sensitivities to external perturbations from electric fields , scale down rapidly with increasing @xmath375 . from this point of view",
    ", it may be advantageous to study highly - charged ions that show the same types of forbidden transitions like the neutral atoms or singly - charged ions that are used in optical clocks today . for @xmath376",
    ", the hyperfine - induced @xmath377 transition in be - like ions appears at a transition energy of about 30  ev with a natural linewidth on the order of 1  hz @xcite . at still higher @xmath375 , the ratio of transition frequency to the natural linewidth decreases for this type of transition .",
    "so far , proposals for clocks with highly charged ions have identified suitable transitions within the ground state configuration that provide a low sensitivity to field - induced frequency shifts at a transition frequency in the infrared or visible spectral range : hyperfine transitions in the electronic ground state of hydrogen - like ions @xcite and electric quadrupole transitions within the @xmath378 configuration of the re@xmath379 sequence @xcite .",
    "given the wide choice of positive charge states in different isoelectronic sequences , it is foreseeable that more opportunities may be discovered .",
    "an important consideration in the pursuit of higher frequencies is that the development of low - noise coherent sources of radiation and of the required clockwork for the counting of periods seems to pose major challenges because materials for amplifiers or mixers that provide a similar efficiency as it is now available in the visible spectral range are not known .",
    "promising results have been obtained with harmonic generation from near - infrared femtosecond frequency combs in gas jets @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the frequency of the comb modes can be stabilized , controlled and measured in the infrared spectral region , while the conversion of the original frequency comb into a sequence of odd harmonics makes the ensuing measurement precision available in the vacuum - ultraviolet .",
    "this method has now permitted to perfom precision spectroscopy and frequency measurements of transitions in rare gases at xuv wavelengths around 50 nm @xcite .",
