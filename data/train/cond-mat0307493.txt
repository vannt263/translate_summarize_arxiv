    "<S> static effective interactions are constructed from the density and spin structure functions using sumrules . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both spin and density fluctuations contribute about equally to the effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> our results show , in agreement with recent experiments , a flattening of the single  particle self  energy with increasing density , which eventually leads to a divergent effective mass .    </S>",
    "<S> two  dimensional liquid 3 is particularly interesting because it is , even at zero temperature , not self  bound and can , therefore , be studied in a wide density range . although governed by one of the simplest hamiltonians for realistic many  body systems , </S>",
    "<S> 3 exhibits a wide range of delicate and complex phenomena which have , by  and  large , been resilient to a understanding from the underlying hamiltonian . only recently , </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo techniques have moved to a point where structural properties have been understood from first principles @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> low  energy dynamical properties of 3 at low temperatures are phenomenologically described by landau s fermi  liquid theory , which establishes relationships between observable quantities such as the specific heat , the compressibility , and the magnetic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the so  called fermi  liquid parameters in 3 has therefore been a recurring issue in theoretical low  temperature research . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of fermi  liquid parameters in terms of feynman diagrams is operationally well defined , but the execution of the theory from an underlying microscopic hamiltonian is far too complicated to be practical . </S>",
    "<S> hence , many attempts have been made to explain the features of fermi  liquid parameters within semi  phenomenological models @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> technically , our calculations correspond to those of ref . , but we will use as much information as possible from accurate ground state monte carlo simulations .    the relevant quantity for the effective mass is the single  particle propagator @xmath0 in the vicinity of the fermi surface . it is expressed in terms of the proper self  </S>",

    "<S> the structure function can be written as @xmath5 where the components are constructed from the structure functions for parallel and antiparallel spins . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities are obtained by either directly evaluating the expectation value of @xmath6 or by fourier transforming the corresponding pair distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> the first procedure is more accurate for long wavelength up to the size of the simulation box , whereas the latter is appropriate for medium and short wave lengths . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can determine the long  wavelength limit of @xmath7 from the bulk compressibility ; we will comment on this below . </S>",
    "<S> we have taken the fourier transform of the pair distribution function for wave numbers @xmath8 , and direct simulation data for long wavelength , and have smoothly interpolated these data towards @xmath9 . </S>",

    "<S> the fluctuations of our results are due to the statistical uncertainties of the monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these are most pronounced in the spin  dependent correlations since the spin  structure function , @xmath46 , is the difference of two quantities obtained from dmc simulations , but these fluctuations do not affect our general result .    </S>",
    "<S> the overall theoretical picture is practically the same as the experimental one , although our theory overestimates the correlation effect somewhat and the instability occurs around 0.048  @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental ratio @xmath45 is , to reasonable accuracy , a linear function of the density which goes through zero between @xmath47@xmath12 and @xmath48@xmath12 , causing a singular @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical calculations reproduce the experimental values within about 10 - 20 percent when compared with the spectrum of the non  interacting fermi gas . </S>",

    "<S> both effects are individually insufficient to reproduce the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case in both two and three dimensions @xcite , but the relative importance of spin  </S>",

    "<S> three and two dimensions , one observes a divergence of the effective mass at some high density . extrapolating the data of ref . </S>",
    "<S> , one observes that the divergence of the effective mass would appear in 3d at a density 0.03 @xmath51 , whereas the liquid  </S>",
    "<S> solid phase transition occurs at 0.023 @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d situation is somewhat different : ref . </S>",
    "<S> implies a divergence of @xmath49 at about 0.051  @xmath12 ; earlier data @xcite suggest a somewhat higher density . </S>",
    "<S> the film freezes between 0.052  @xmath12 @xcite and 0.063  @xmath12 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it seems unlikely that freezing and the singularity of the effective mass have the same cause . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence in @xmath49 is due to the increasing importance of spin fluctuations with density . </S>",
    "<S> this is manifested very clearly in 2d and also visible in 3d . </S>",
    "<S> the theory used here reproduces those features , in both 3d and 2d , at a semi  quantitative level without the need for phenomenological input . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we obtain a negative slope of the single particle spectrum is clearly a consequence of the g0w approximation ; a self  consistent theory should not have solutions for unstable situations . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , relatively simple approximations have often shown the same physics as more sophisticated theories in the stable regime , who then simply cease to have solutions beyond the point of an instability . </S>",
    "<S> we are presently not prepared to speculate on `` what s beyond '' the singularity .    </S>",
    "<S> a second interesting question is why the 2d theory apparently overestimates the effective mass , whereas it underestimates @xmath49 in 3d . </S>",
    "<S> one can only speculate that a 2d model is an obvious simplification of the real physical situation of an adsorbed film , and little is known about the severity of such an approximation for 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that understanding the value of the effective mass in two  dimensional 3 is  in analogy to the more common three  </S>",
    "<S> dimensional case  not a simple problem , and simple paradigms that try to attribute the effect to a single cause are genuinely inadequate . </S>",
    "<S> both spin and density  fluctuations have profound effects , although spin  </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations are stronger in 2d and we are more inclined to associate the effect of density fluctuations to feynman - cohen backflow instead of `` localization '' . we hesitate to identify the flattening of the single  particle spectrum with a mott transition , it may well indicate either a transition to `` anomalous occupation numbers '' or indicate simply a lack of self  consistency of the calculation of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative improvement will first be sought in a more accurate description of the response functions @xcite . </S>"
