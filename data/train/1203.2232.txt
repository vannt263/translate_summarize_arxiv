    "up to a certain energy level standard model(sm ) has an impressive success explaining experimental data so far .",
    "nowadays lhc is running with one of the main motivation of discovering sm higgs boson and if sm higgs boson to be discovered , the leading problem to focus will be stabilizing its mass against quadratically divergent radiative corrections , namely the hierarchy problem .",
    "eventually the hierarchy problem is not the only problem that sm faces .",
    "sm also does not correctly account for neutrino oscillations , thus nonzero masses of neutrinos , it can not explain dark matter phenomena , it has no explanation to strong cp problem , and many more .",
    "so it is obligatory to go beyond sm .",
    "so far with this purpose many theories and models have been introduced such as grand unified thories(gut)@xcite , supersymmetric models(susy)@xcite , models with extra dimensions@xcite , @xmath3 models@xcite , left - right symmetric models@xcite , ( b - l ) extended sm models@xcite , doublet and triplet higgs models@xcite , little higgs(lh ) models@xcite and many more .",
    "each of these models have motivations to solve one or more of the problems that sm encounters .    among these approaches",
    "little higgs models deserve attention due to their elegant solution to hierarchy problem .",
    "little higgs model was first proposed by arkani - hamed@xcite , and following the original idea several variations of lh models were introduced .",
    "little higgs models solve hierarchy problem by first enlarging the symmetry group of sm , and then by using collective symmetry mechanism to cancel out divergences of higgs mass .",
    "the lh models differ in their assumed symmetry group and in the representation of scalar multiplets and they can be classified into two groups as simple group and product group lh models@xcite . among product group lh models ,",
    "the most economical one is the littlest higgs model@xcite which has a global @xmath4 symmetry containing weakly gauged @xmath5 subgroup .",
    "littlest higgs model as a consequence of its enlarged symmetry contains new heavy gauge bosons and a new heavy scalar sector arising from a complex @xmath6 group containing two neutral scalars , a charged scalar and a double charged scalar .",
    "the importance of this scalar sector is that especially charged scalars have very distinct collider signatures@xcite .",
    "the main problem the original littlest higgs model faced was satisfying electroweak precision data(ewpd ) and to be consistent with the recent bounds on the lightest heavy scalar mass arising from searchs at tevatron@xcite .",
    "the free parameters of the model were strictly constrained meaning a severe fine tunning has to be done . in order to overcome this problem t parity",
    "were introduced which like r parity of susy introduces a discrete @xmath7 symmetry to the model@xcite . as a consequence of implementing t parity interactions between sm particles and new particles",
    "are restricted , thus parameters were relaxed .",
    "another consequence of this restriction is that the lightest new heavy gauge boson become a perfect candidate for dark matter@xcite .",
    "but in order to account for non zero neutrino masses t parity is broken .",
    "introducing t parity is not the only way of saving littlest higgs model from strict constraints .",
    "another method , which is also used in this work , is to charge fermions under both @xmath6 gauge groups@xcite .",
    "as mentioned , one of the problems of sm is that it can not account for nonzero masses of neutrinos .",
    "the existence of complex @xmath6 scalar group in the littlest higgs model allows neutrinos to gain their masses by implementing majorana like mass term in the yukawa lagrangian without need of right handed neutrinos .",
    "the interactions of lepton doublets and complex @xmath6 scalars in yukawa lagrangian predicts lepton flavor and number violation by unit two , directly from decays of charged scalars , and this is an interesting and distinguishing feature of littlest higgs model@xcite .",
    "search for lepton flavor violating signals is one of the most interesting topics in collider physics , and in these searches one channel under investigation is the lepton flavor violation resulting from decays of charged and double charged scalars .",
    "thus the models containing scalar , with hypercharge two are expected to give the most promising results . in litarature",
    "there are several models containing a scalar triplet and lepton flavor violating signals in most of these models have been examined@xcite",
    ". thus it will also be interesting to know the possible productions of charged scalars in littlest higgs model and their lepton flavor violating signals at lhc .    in this work , we study the main production channels of heavy charged scalars and their lepton flavor violating collider signatures at lhc . in literature",
    "there are several works estimating sizable production rates of heavy charged scalars which are either model independent or arising from other models rather than littlest higgs via @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 at hadron colliders@xcite . in these searches",
    "they are basically investigating the possibility of a charged scalar satisfying the experimental bounds such as @xmath8@xcite . in the littlest higgs model due to the restrictions on the symmetry breaking scale",
    ", the heavy scalars can not have a mass lower than @xmath9 .",
    "thus these production channels including their lepton flavor and number violating final states need more investigation in the context of the littlest higgs model . in proton collisions",
    "the charged scalars of the littlest higgs model can be produced exculisively or in pairs .",
    "the exculisive production of the single charged scalar with a gauge boson mainly come from exchange of gauge bosons or neutral heavy scalars in s - channel . in the model couplings of the boson exchanges",
    "are dependent on @xmath10(vacuum expectation value of the scalar triplet ) , thus when @xmath10 is small enough to allow lepton flavor violation they are not observable . for the production of double charged scalars the exculisive channels @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the pair production process @xmath14 are analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as also mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first three production processes are supressed by a factor of @xmath15 , hence only the process @xmath14 can have significant production rates at lhc .",
    "in addition to these production processes , heavy charged scalars of the littlest higgs model can be produced in pairs at lhc .    in this work ,",
    "the pair production processes : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 via proton collisions at lhc are examined . in section two ,",
    "we beriefly reviewed littlest higgs model mostly following ref .",
    "@xcite , and we present the necessary formulation used in this work . in section three",
    "we present the production cross sections of production channels investigated in this work .",
    "we also present the final state analysis considering possible lepton flavor and number violating signals with our numerical estmates for lhc in section three .",
    "finally at section four we concluded that through the all possible final states , three of them can be observed as lepton flavor or number violation at lhc .",
    "the littlest higgs model , as the most economical of the product group little higgs models , have a global symmetry @xmath4 with a locally gauged subgroup @xmath16 . at a scale @xmath17 , the global symmetry @xmath4 is broken spontaneously to @xmath18 with a chosen vacuum condensate . at low energies the dynamics of the symmetry breaking mechanism can be described by nambu goldstone boson ( ngb ) degrees of freedom , to each broken generator there exist a ngb .",
    "it is possible to represent the group structure as @xmath19 , where subscribes denote the hypercharge of the group . in the collective symmetry",
    "breaking mechanism , breaking of a global symmetry also triggers the symmetry breaking of the gauged subgroup of @xmath16 to @xmath20 of the standard model . during this symmetry",
    "breaking four of the ngbs are eaten by gauge bosons acquiring them their masses , while in the representationps a doublet @xmath21 and a triplet @xmath22 remain physical .",
    "for these ngbs a coleman weinberg potential can be generated at one loop level .",
    "the generated scalar potential triggers usual electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) at chosen vacua of @xmath23 and @xmath10 respectively for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "after ewsb , there are four new heavy scalars , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 which remain in the scalar sector in addition to a light scalar @xmath21 which is identified as the sm higgs boson .",
    "all scalars excluding @xmath21 are degenerate in mass :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the mass of the higgs boson , @xmath30 is the higher symmetry breaking scale of the littlest higgs model , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the higgs field and the scalar triplet respectively which are bounded by electroweak precision data .",

    "<S> in this work productions of charged and doubly charged scalars and their lepton flavor violating collider signals in the framework of littlest higgs model at lhc are studied . in the allowed parameter region of the littlest higgs model , the production rates of the scalars of littlest higgs model via @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained that charged and doubly charged scalar pairs can be produced at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> considering the possible lepton flavor violating decays of charged scalars found in literature , final state analysis is done . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis show that depending on the model parameters , lepton number and lepton flavor violations resulting from single and double charged heavy scalars of the littlest higgs model can be observed at lhc . </S>"
