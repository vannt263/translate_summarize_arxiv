    "dynamical studies of nearby elliptical galaxies have shown that there is a correlation between the galaxy luminosity and the mass m@xmath2 of the central black hole ( magorrian et al .",

    "it is therefore possible to estimate the bh mass in agn from the integrated host luminosity and/or the velocity dispersion ( which is much more difficult to measure ) .",
    "+ in figure 2 , adapted from kormendy and gebhard 2001 , the m@xmath2 ",
    "m@xmath13 is reproduced together with the regions covered by the estimated bh masses for our two samples of bl lacs and rlqs .",
    "it turns out that bh masses are in the range 5@xmath1410@xmath15 to 5@xmath1410@xmath16 and cover the region of most massive objects .",
    "it also turns out that on average bh masses of rlq are a factor @xmath1 2 greater than those of bl lacs as a direct consequence of the different average luminosity of their hosts ( @xmath17=1.5@xmath14 10@xmath18 for bl lacs and @xmath17=2.4@xmath14 10@xmath18 for rlqs ) .",
    "the estimated bh masses can be used to derive the eddington luminosity l@xmath19 and can be compared with the total luminosity l deduced by the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , yielding the eddington ratio @xmath20 . + for rlqs we assume an average total luminosity of l@xmath21 10@xmath22 ( elvis et al . 1994 ) . in the case of the bl lacs , in order to evaluate the intrinsic emitted total luminosity one has to take into account the beaming .",
    "we took l@xmath23f@xmath24 , where f is the observed flux and @xmath25 is the doppler factor .",
