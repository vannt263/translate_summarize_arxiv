    "in the collective rotation of a deformed nucleus , the rotation axis is perpendicular to the symmetry axis , and the coriolis force , which breaks the cooper pairs , increases with the total angular momentum so that at a certain critical angular momentum all cooper pairs are broken .",
    "the nucleus undergoes then a phase transition from the superfluid phase to the normal one ( the sn phase transition ) .",
    "this is called the mottelson - valatin effect  @xcite .",
    "a similar effect is expected in spherical nuclei , although the rotation is no longer collective .",
    "the total angular momentum is made up by those of the nucleons from the broken pairs , which occupy the single - particle levels around the fermi surface and block them against the scattered pairs .",
    "the pairing correlations decrease until a sufficiently large total angular momentum @xmath3 , where the pairing gap @xmath4 completely vanishes . at finite temperature ( @xmath5 0 )",
    ", the increase of @xmath6 relaxes the tight packing of quasiparticles around the fermi surface , which is caused by a large angular momentum @xmath7 , and spreads them farther away from the fermi level .",
    "this makes some levels become partially unoccupied , therefore , available for scattered pairs . as the result ,",
    "when @xmath6 increases up to some critical value @xmath8 , the pairing correlations are energetically favored , and the pairing gap reappears .",
    "as @xmath6 goes higher , the increase of a large number of quasiparticles eventually breaks down the pairing gap at @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "this phenomenon , predicted by kamuri  @xcite and moretto  @xcite , is called thermally assisted pairing or anomalous pairing , and later as pairing reentrance by balian , flocard and v@xmath11n@xmath11roni  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown already in the 1960s that the sharp sn - phase transition at @xmath12 in the mottelson - valatin effect is an artifact of the bcs method . as a matter of fact , a proper particle - number projection before variation has removed the discontinuity in the pairing gap as a decreasing function of the angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "similarly , by taking the effect of thermal fluctuations in the pairing field into account , the sn phase transition predicted by the bcs theory is smoothed out .",
    "the gap @xmath13 of a non - rotating nucleus does not collapse at @xmath14 , but monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath6 , remaining finite even at @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this result is reconfirmed by shell - model calculations of pairing energy as a function of excitation energy  @xcite , and by embedding the exact eigenvalues of the pairing problem into the canonical ensemble  @xcite . by considering an exactly solvable cranked deformed shell model hamiltonian",
    "it has also been shown that the pairing gap , quenched at @xmath16 0 and high rotational frequency , reappears at @xmath8 ( @xmath17 ) at @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "however , different from the prediction by the bcs theory , the pairing gap does not vanish at @xmath18 .    the behavior of hot rotating nuclei can be put in correspondence with superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field , where the magnetic field plays the role as that of the nuclear rotation .",
    "the reentrance of superconducting correlations , which is also known as the unconventional superconductivity , has been the subject of recent theoretical and experimental studies in condensed matter .",
    "the grenoble high magnetic field laboratory has recently discovered that urhge becomes superconducting at low temperature in the presence of a strong magnetic field ( between 8 and 13 t ) , well above the field value of 2 t , at which superconductivity is first destroyed  @xcite .",
    "the reentrance of superconductivity under the magnetic field is interpreted as to be caused by spin reorientation  @xcite , which bears some similarity with the reappearance of the scattered pairs in rotating hot nuclei discussed above .",
    "recently , we have developed an approach based on the finite - temperature bcs ( ftbcs ) that includes the effects due to quasiparticle - number fluctuations in the pairing field and the @xmath0 projection of angular momentum at @xmath5 0 , which we call as the ftbcs1 ( with `` 1 '' denoting the effect due to quasiparticle - number fluctuations )  @xcite .",
    "this approach reproduces well the effect of smoothing out the sn phase transition at @xmath5 0 as well as the pairing reentrance in hot ( noncollectively ) rotating nuclei . in the latter case , for @xmath7 the pairing gap also reappears at @xmath8 and remains finite at @xmath18 .",
    "it has also been pointed out that the microscopic mechanism of the nonvanishing gap at high @xmath6 is the quasiparticle - number fluctuations , which are ignored in the conventional bcs theory .",
    "a refined version of the ftbcs1 also includes the contribution of coupling to pair vibrations within the self - consistent quasiparticle random - phase approximation  @xcite .",
    "that the pairing reentrance is not an artifact of the mean field analysis , but a robust physical effect , has been obtained by exact diagonalization of the 2d attractive hubbard model , where a nonmonotonic filed dependence of the pair susceptibility in the presence of the external magnetic field was found for various cluster sizes both in the weak and strong coupling limit  @xcite . nonetheless , the experimental extraction of the pairing gap in hot nuclei is not simple because one has to properly exclude the admixture with the contribution of uncorrelated single - particle configurations from the odd - even mass difference  @xcite .",
    "therefore the detection of the pairing reentrance effect by using the experimentally extracted pairing gaps seems to be elusive , especially when the formally derived pairing gap has a value smaller than the average spacing between the single - particle levels .",
    "meanwhile , the heat capacity has been extracted from the experimental level densities  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a bump or an @xmath19 shape on the curve of the heat capacity at @xmath20 allows one to discuss about the smoothing of the sn phase transition in finite nuclei . in a recent calculation of the heat capacity in @xmath2ge within the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) approach , by reconfirming the pairing reentrance effect , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claimed that they found a local dip in the heat capacity at rotation frequency of 0.5 mev at @xmath21 0.45 mev , and a corresponding local maximum on the temperature dependence of the logarithm of level density .",
    "they associated such irregularities in the heat capacity and level density as the signatures of the pairing reentrance .",
    "there are , however , two concerns regarding these results .",
    "the first one is that , as well - known , at such low temperature the smmc approach produces quite large error bars . as a consequence , instead of approaching zero as it should be to fulfill the third law of thermodynamics , the smmc heat capacity at @xmath22 0.5 mev jumps to 25 @xmath23 30 ( fig .",
    "4 of @xcite ) , which makes the statement on the signature of the pairing reentrance ambiguous .",
    "the second one is that the smmc in ref .",
    "@xcite used the same fock - space single - particle energies of the shells ( @xmath24 ) for both neutron and proton spectra .",
    "hence , the difference between neutron and proton spectra came solely from the difference in the valence particle numbers outside the closed - shell core of @xmath25ca , which ignored altogether the coulomb barrier in the proton spectrum .",
    "our ftbcs1 theory is free from such deficiency at low @xmath6 , and it works well with the schematic as well as single - particle spectra , which are obtained from the realistic woods - saxon potential .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we will calculate the heat capacity as well as the level density within the ftbcs1 theory to see if these quantities can be used to identify the pairing reentrance phenomenon in realistic nuclei at finite temperature and angular momentum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "therefore the nuclear temperature can only be extracted from the level density by using the clausius definition of thermodynamic entropy .",
    "this task is not easy because of the discrete and finite nuclear spectra ( see , e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nonetheless , instead of using temperature , it would be interesting to see if the pairing reentrance takes place in the pair correlator as a function of excitation energy at various values of angular momentum within the method of ref .",
    "the present paper studies the temperature dependences of the heat capacity and level density in hot medium - mass nuclei , which undergo a noncollective rotation about the symmetry axis .",
    "the numerical calculations , carried out by using the realistic woods - saxon single - particle energies for @xmath1ni and @xmath2ge within the ftbcs and ftbcs1 theories , have shown the pairing reentrance in the pairing gap at finite angular momentum @xmath46 and temperature @xmath6 .",
    "instead of decreasing with increasing @xmath6 , the gap first increases with @xmath6 then decreases at higher @xmath6 .",
    "it is demonstrated that the heat capacity @xmath57 , or rather @xmath102 , and level density @xmath129 can be used to experimentally identify the pairing reentrance effect .",
    "the pairing reentrance , when it occurs , leads to a clear depletion in the temperature dependence of the heat capacity , whereas the level density weakly changes from a convex function of @xmath6 to a concave one .    regarding the appearance of the local minimum in the heat capacity because of the pairing reentrance",
    ", the results of the present paper agree with that of the smmc calculations in ref .",
    "however , the present results show no pronounced local maximum in the temperature dependence of the level density . the pairing reentrance is seen in the proton pairing gap of @xmath2ge at low @xmath46 , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite reported this effect in the neutron pairing energy .",
    "the test calculations by using the same single - particle configuration as that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but obtained within the woods - saxon potential , reveals that the neutron pairing reentrance in @xmath2ge is an artifact , which is caused by the use of the same single - particle spectrum for both protons and neutrons , whereas the irregularity on the curve for the logarithm of level density , reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , is caused by unphysically large values of the heat capacity at low @xmath6 in the smmc approach .",
    "the numerical calculations were carried out using the fortran imsl library by visual numerics on the riken integrated cluster of clusters ( ricc ) system .",
