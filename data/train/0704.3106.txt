    "born with masses between the least massive stars ( @xmath0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the most massive planets ( @xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , brown dwarfs at once extend our understanding of the formation and evolution of both stars and planets .",
    "in the decade since the discovery of the first brown dwarfs @xcite , the study of star- and planet - formation has increasingly trained its attention on these objects that , while being neither star nor planet , may provide key insights to understanding the origins of both @xcite .",
    "such an understanding must be founded on accurate measurements of fundamental physical properties ",
    "masses , radii , and luminosities .",
    "unfortunately , the number of objects for which these properties can be measured directly is extremely small .",
    "though rare , eclipsing binaries have long been employed as ideal laboratories for directly measuring fundamental stellar parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the power of eclipsing binaries lies in their provision of masses and radii with only the most basic of theoretical assumptions . with the addition of atmosphere models",
    "the ratio of effective temperatures can also be derived , and luminosities can then be determined directly through the stefan - boltzmann law without knowledge of distance . finally , considering the two objects properties together permits study of the binary as twins at birth whose evolutionary histories differ because of their different masses .",
    "thus the recent discovery of a brown - dwarf eclipsing binary system in the orion nebula cluster , ( hereafter 2m053505 ) , offers a unique laboratory with which to directly and accurately test the predictions of theoretical models of brown - dwarf formation and evolution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) . in paper",
    "i , we presented a preliminary analysis of the orbit and of the mutual eclipses in 2m053505  to directly measure the masses and radii of both components , as well as the ratio of their effective temperatures .",
    "our mass measurements reveal both objects in this young binary system to be substellar , with masses of @xmath2 m@xmath3 and @xmath4 m@xmath3 , accurate to @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , from the observed eclipse durations and orbital velocities we directly measured the radii of the brown dwarfs to be @xmath6 r@xmath7 and @xmath8 r@xmath7 , accurate to @xmath9 , and representing the first direct measurements of brown - dwarf radii .",
    "such large radii are generally consistent with theoretical predictions of young brown dwarfs in the earliest stages of gravitational contraction .    surprisingly , however , we reported in paper  i that the lower - mass brown dwarf has an effective temperature that is slightly  but significantly ",
    "warmer than its higher - mass companion .",
    "such a reversal of temperatures with mass is not predicted by any theoretical model for coeval brown dwarfs .",
    "this finding has potentially important ramifications for theoretical brown - dwarf evolutionary tracks , and thus for our understanding of brown - dwarf formation more generally .    in this paper , we present supplementary light - curve and radial - velocity measurements (  [ data ] ) which we use to refine our determination of the basic physical properties of 2m053505  (  [ results ] ) .",
    "we verify the finding of a temperature reversal with mass in this system , and quantitatively compare the empirically determined physical parameters with those predicted by theoretical evolutionary tracks .",
    "we then briefly explore the implications of the temperature reversal in 2m053505  for theoretical models of brown - dwarf formation and evolution (  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "specifically , we consider whether the temperature reversal can be explained by dynamical brown - dwarf formation scenarios and/or by the physical effects of strong surface fields on young brown dwarfs .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we observed 2m053505  with the _ phoenix _ spectrograph on gemini south on eight separate nights from december 2002 to january 2003 ( first reported in paper  i ) and again on 03 march 2005 ( newly reported here ) .",
    "all nine observations were obtained with the same instrument setup .",
    "following @xcite , we observed the wavelength range 1.55151.5585 @xmath10 m ( central wavelength 1.555 @xmath10 m ; @xmath11 band ) at a resolving power of @xmath12 ( slit size of @xmath13 ) .",
    "exposure times were varied between 1.0 and 3.3 hr by the queue observers based on sky conditions .",
    "the typical exposure time was 2.6 hr ( i.e.  @xmath14 orbital phase ; see  [ lightcurve ] ) , divided into 6 telescope nods in an abbaab pattern for the purposes of sky subtraction and cosmic - ray rejection .",
    "an observation of the coravel - elodie high - precision radial - velocity standard ( k4 iii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was obtained immediately before or after each observation of 2m053505  to monitor the instrument wavelength zero point .",
    "in addition , observations were obtained of a grid of late - type spectral standards , with spectral types of m0 to m9 , selected from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the standard - star observations are summarized in table  [ standards ] .",
    "the observations were processed using interactive data language procedures developed specifically for optimal extraction of _ phoenix _ spectra .",
    "the background subtraction step includes logic to compensate for variations in the night sky lines due to grating motion or brightness variations between nods .",
    "a bootstrap procedure is used to determine a wavelength solution from thnear calibration spectra obtained immediately before and after the science exposures .",
    "first an _ a priori _ wavelength dispersion is determined by matching a _ phoenix _ spectrum of a k giant with the kpno fts atlas of arcturus @xcite .",
    "next , a small wavelength shift ( less than 1 km s@xmath15 ) is applied to match the mean wavelengths of the three strongest thnear lines as a function of position along the slit .",
    "finally , a multi - gaussian fit is used to empirically determine the wavelengths of the remaining thnear lines .",
    "the individual exposures from the different slit positions are combined and interpolated onto a uniform dispersion and then continuum normalized using sixth - order polynomial fits to the high points in the spectra .",
    "typical signal - to - noise ratios of the extracted spectra were @xmath16 per resolution element for the nine observations of 2m053505  and @xmath17 per resolution element for the standard stars .",
    "absolute heliocentric radial velocities of the late - type standards were determined relative to the coravel - elodie standard star hd  50778 ( see above ) . to minimize the possibility of introducing systematic velocity offsets due to large differences in spectral type between this k4 standard and the late - m standards , we applied velocity corrections in a step - wise fashion , determining the velocity shift of each sequentially later type standard by cross - correlating it with the standard from the previous step ( e.g. , m0 relative to k4 , m1 relative to m0 , and so on ) .",
    "the radial velocities reported below are thus formally on the coravel - elodie system @xcite .",
    "radial velocities of the two components of 2m053505  were determined via the technique of broadening functions ( bfs ) described by @xcite . as discussed in that study ,",
    "bfs are less prone than simple cross - correlation techniques to ",
    "peak pulling , \" in which closely spaced correlation features in double - lined binaries can alter the positions of the correlation peak centroids , particularly when the velocity separation of the components is on the order of the spectral resolution .",
    "the bf analysis requires a radial - velocity template spectrum that is well matched in spectral type to the target ; we determined that the m6.5 star lhs  292 from our grid of standards was the best template for this purpose ( see below ) .    in seven of the nine _ phoenix _ spectra of 2m053505",
    "the bfs show two clear peaks , an example of which is shown in fig.[bf - fig ] .",
    "for these seven observations , radial velocities and their uncertainties were determined using two - gaussian fits to the bfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we designate the component producing the stronger peak in the bfs as the ` primary ' and the component producing the weaker peak in the bfs the ` secondary ' ( as we show below , the primary component so defined is also the more massive of the pair ) .",
    "one of the remaining two observations was by chance taken during eclipse of the primary ( orbital phase 0.75 ; see fig.[ilc - fig ] ) and thus appears as a single - lined spectrum ; the bf peak was fit with a single gaussian and its velocity assigned to the secondary .",
    "the other observation occurs shortly after eclipse of the secondary ( orbital phase 0.12 ) and thus appears as a blended spectrum producing a single , broadened bf peak ; in this case two gaussians were fit , their initial centroids estimated from the preliminary orbit solution of paper  i and their widths fixed based on the widths of the well - separated bf peaks from the other spectra .",
    "radial velocities and their uncertainties so measured are summarized in table  [ rv - data ] and displayed in fig .",
    "[ rv - fig ] .",
    "we found that the bf peaks of both components appeared strongest when we used lhs  292 , an old m6.5 dwarf ( see table  [ standards ] ) , as the radial - velocity template in the bf analysis .",
    "the bf peaks were @xmath18 weaker when we used the m6 or m7 dwarfs as templates , and weaker still when we used earlier or later templates .",
    "this suggests that the spectral types of both components of 2m053505  are also @xmath19m6.5 .",
    "indeed , we found in paper  i ( cf .  fig .  3 in that paper )",
    "that the isolated spectrum of the primary component of 2m053505  very closely matches that of lhs  292 , and that the @xmath20 colors of 2m053505  imply a spectral type in combined light of m6.5@xmath21 with negligible reddening . taken together , the available evidence suggests that the components of 2m053505  have very similar spectral types of @xmath19m6.5@xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath22  k @xcite .",
    "while our light - curve analysis below (  [ analysis ] ) yields a @xmath23 ratio of @xmath24 , reinforcing the conclusion that the components of 2m053505  are very similar in spectral type , we caution that our assignment of absolute spectral types is preliminary and subject to systematic uncertainty .",
    "the differences in spectral features seen in late - m standard stars are extremely subtle for dwarfs with spectral types m4m8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the low s / n of our 2m053505  spectra prohibits a detailed analysis of spectral features .",
    "moreover , the low surface gravities and strong magnetic fields of young , low - mass objects can bias classification of their spectra , in the sense that the true spectral types may be 12 subtypes later than inferred from comparison to old , high - gravity dwarfs @xcite .",
    "thus , for our purposes here , we emphasize that the spectral match between 2m053505  and the adopted radial - velocity template is sufficiently good to permit precise radial velocity measurements , and that the spectral types of the components of 2m053505are evidently very similar to one another .    because the components of 2m053505  have such similar spectral types , the relative bf peak areas reflect the two components relative contributions to the total light of the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in particular",
    ", the primary component apparently contributes approximately 50% more flux than the secondary at 1.555 @xmath10 m ( see fig .",
    "[ bf - fig ] ) .",
    "this flux ratio provides an important additional constraint for removing degeneracies in the determination of physical parameters , as we discuss in  [ analysis ] .",
    "the component masses that we determine in  [ analysis ] follow directly from an orbit solution fit to the observed radial velocities , and thus the uncertainties in the derived masses ( and in other properties that in turn depend on those masses ) depend sensitively on uncertainties in the radial velocity measurements .",
    "the mean precisions of the radial - velocity measurements from the bf analysis are formally 1.7 and 1.9 km  s@xmath15 for the 2m053505primary and secondary , respectively ( see @xmath25 column of table  [ rv - data ] ) .",
    "however , the accuracy of these measurements can potentially be degraded by various systematic effects . at the instrument level ,",
    "the stability of the wavelength zero - point is of particular concern .",
    "to assess this , we cross - correlated the first observation of the coravel - elodie standard star hd  50778 against each subsequent observation of this star , providing a measure of the instrument stability over the course of our _ phoenix _ observations .",
    "the resulting radial velocities of hd  50778 exhibit an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.45 km  s@xmath15 on the nights that 2m053505was observed , which is much smaller than the random errors in the individual measurements of 2m053505 .",
    "another possible source of systematic error is spectral - type mismatch between 2m053505  and the radial - velocity template .",
    "however , as discussed above , the radial - velocity template that we used in the bf analysis appears to match the spectral types of the 2m053505  components very well .",
    "moreover , the components of 2m053505have very similar spectral types to one another , so that any systematic effects due to spectral mismatch with the template should affect both components similarly , in which case only the center - of - mass velocity will be affected .",
    "finally , the observed radial velocities can be affected by spots on the surfaces of the brown dwarfs that cause phase - dependent distortions in the shapes of the spectral lines , and in fact we show in  [ spots ] that spots are clearly present on one or both of the components in 2m053505 .",
    "while the data suggest that this effect is small , we have not yet incorporated a physical spot model into our analysis and thus any spot signatures remain as potential systematics in the radial velocities . in v1174 ori , for example ,",
    "a young eclipsing binary with photometric spot amplitudes similar to those observed in 2m053505 , we found that the resulting radial - velocity distortions were as large as @xmath24 km  s@xmath15 at certain orbital phases @xcite .",
    "analyses of other spotted , low - mass eclipsing systems find similar effects ; for example , gu boo shows distortions of @xmath26 km  s@xmath15 @xcite and yy gem shows distortions of @xmath24 km  s@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "any spot - induced radial - velocity distortions in 2m053505  would need to be 23 times larger than in these systems to be comparable to the random measurement errors of @xmath272 km  s@xmath15 ( for an example of such a system , see * ? ? ?",
    "encouragingly , the residuals of the radial - velocity measurements with respect to the final orbit solution of  [ analysis ] ( @xmath28 and 1.2 for the primary and secondary velocities , respectively ; see table  [ rv - data ] ) do not indicate that systematic effects dominate the radial - velocity measurement errors .",
    "we have continued to photometrically monitor 2m053505  intensively with the 1.0-m and 1.3-m telescopes at ctio and , as of this writing , possess a total of 2404 @xmath29-band measurements spanning the time period 1994 december to 2006 april . the observing campaign to date",
    "is summarized in table  [ obs - table ] , and the individual measurements are provided in table  [ lc - data ] .",
    "we have excluded a small number of observations with photometric errors larger than 0.1 mag .",
    "thus , photometric errors on the individual measurements have a range of 0.010.1 mag , with a mean error of 0.024 mag and a median error of 0.020 mag .",
    "a period search based on the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) technique of @xcite reveals an unambiguous period of @xmath30 d. the pdm technique is well suited to periodic variability that is highly non - sinusoidal in nature , as is the case for most detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "this updated period is slightly shorter than , but not inconsistent with , the period reported in paper  i ( see table  [ properties - table ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ ilc - fig ] we show the @xmath29-band light curve of 2m053505folded on this period .",
    "two distinct eclipses are clearly evident and cleanly separated in phase , as is typical of fully detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "one eclipse  the ` primary eclipse ' at orbital phase @xmath31is notably deeper than the other ; this marks the time in the orbit when the hotter component is eclipsed which , as discussed in paper  i and below in  [ reversal ] , in this system is the lower - mass component .    in addition , the time from primary to secondary eclipse is longer than that from secondary to primary eclipse , indicating an eccentric orbit .",
    "more quantitatively , the two parameters that determine the shape and orientation of the orbit  the eccentricity , @xmath32 , and the argument of periastron , @xmath33can be estimated from geometrical considerations relating the orbital period , the durations of the eclipses ( 6.8 hr and 10.1 hr , respectively ) , and their 6.5-day separation in time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from which we estimate @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these initial estimates of @xmath32 and @xmath33 agree well with the more precise values that we obtain from detailed light - curve modeling and analysis below (  [ analysis ] ; table [ properties - table ] ) .",
    "in addition to the extensive @xmath29-band light curve measurements , we have also now obtained a set of near - infrared ( @xmath20 ) light curves . these are presented and analyzed in a subsequent paper @xcite , but we note here that the same features observed in the @xmath29-band light curve are also seen at these other wavelengths .      as in paper",
    "i , we have performed a simultaneous analysis of the _ phoenix _ radial velocities and the @xmath29-band light curve using the eclipsing - binary algorithms of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* updated 2005 ; hereafter wd ) as implemented in the phoebe code of @xcite .",
    "wd  has become standard in the modeling and analysis of all manner of eclipsing binary systems , having grown in sophistication over the past 35 years to include , e.g. , phase - dependent projection effects in eccentric orbits , radial - velocity perturbations arising from proximity and eclipse effects , apsidal motion , and reflection and limb - darkening effects . in",
    "its most advanced implementation , the code can also treat the effects of surface spots , model atmospheres , and asynchronous rotation , including any attendant gravity brightening and radial - velocity perturbations arising from non - sphericity and from phase - dependent variations in the shapes of the components .",
    "for the present study , we add information from the out - of - eclipse variations in the light curve to model asynchronous rotation of the components and as a first step toward accounting for the presence of surface spots (  [ spots ] ) . as part of our ongoing study of 2m053505",
    ", we plan to incorporate progressively more advanced treatments , including a full investigation of surface spots and inclusion of state - of - the - art brown - dwarf model atmospheres . here , as in paper  i , we use simple blackbody spectra in our light curve models .",
    "while brown - dwarf spectra are known to exhibit strong departures from simple blackbodies , we show below that this effect is unlikely to significantly alter our principal findings ; in particular , the reversal of temperatures with mass that we find in 2m053505  is probably not the result of improperly modeled spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "understanding the temperature reversal may ultimately require a proper treatment of surface spots and their influence on the time- and aspect - dependent emergent flux from the system .",
    "to begin , we ran an initial wd  fit to the light - curve and radial - velocity data ( tables [ rv - data ] and [ lc - data ] ) using as initial values the system s orbital and physical parameters from paper  i , together with the updated orbital period from this study (  [ lightcurve ] ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters and their formal uncertainties are summarized in table  [ properties - table ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath36 of this fit is large ( @xmath37 ) , and the r.m.s",
    ".  of the residuals relative to this fit ( 0.033 mag ) is accordingly larger than expected given the typical error on the photometric measurements (  [ lightcurve ] ) .",
    "this suggests an additional source of variability in the light curve  spots , for example  not included in the model .",
    "surface spots are most commonly manifested as low - amplitude , periodic , roughly sinusoidal variations superposed on the eclipse light curve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we searched for such low - amplitude , periodic variations in the light curve of 2m053505  by applying a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite analysis to those portions of the light - curve data obtained outside of eclipse .",
    "we performed this periodogram analysis separately on each epoch of light - curve data ( see table  [ obs - table ] ) , as spot - related variations often show evolution in amplitude and phase with time @xcite .",
    "we find statistically significant periodic signals in all but the first two epochs , these earlier epochs possessing relatively few measurements .",
    "while the amplitudes of these periodic signals vary slightly from epoch to epoch , they are always small ( @xmath38 mag , peak - to - peak ) .",
    "importantly , the periods of these signals are consistent across epochs , with a value of @xmath39  d. spot - related variability observed in other eclipsing binaries is similarly characterized by photometric amplitudes of a few percent and periods that are constant over many epochs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , most likely reflecting the rotation period of one or both binary components .",
    "the implication here is that at least one of the brown dwarfs in 2m053505  is nearly always spotted , and rotates with @xmath40  d.    with a rotation period that is shorter than the orbital period by a factor of ( almost exactly ) 3 , the rotational and orbital angular velocities of 2m053505  have evidently not yet become pseudo - synchronized with one another ( where the rotational angular velocity is synchronized to the orbital angular velocity at periastron ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which for the eccentricity of 2m053505  would give @xmath41 . instead , the rotation of at least one component in 2m053505  is super - synchronous .",
    "such super - synchronicity is probably not surprising given the extreme youth of 2m053505  ( see below ) and that young brown dwarfs tend to be rapid rotators @xcite ; tidal effects have likely not yet had sufficient time to synchronize the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a more detailed discussion of rotation in 2m053505  is beyond the scope of this paper . for our present purposes ,",
    "we proceed to adopt the observed @xmath42  d in our final wd  fit as a constraint on the oblateness of both 2m053505  components .",
    "in addition , we rectify the @xmath29-band light curve by subtracting a sinusoid of @xmath43  d , with the amplitude and phase determined separately for each epoch of data , as described above .",
    "the aim of this rectification procedure is to  remove \" the spot signal from the light curve and to thereby allow the wd  model to achieve goodness of fit without introducing additional spot - fitting parameters that are poorly constrained at present .",
    "we caution , however , that this procedure is _ not _ equivalent to modeling the spots physically .",
    "the inclusion of additional light curves at multiple wavelengths into our analyses @xcite will ultimately be required to constrain the physical properties of the spots and to permit full modeling of their effects on the observed light curves and radial velocities .",
    "bearing these caveats in mind , we proceed with our analysis below using the rectified @xmath29-band light curve , and revisit the possible influence of spots in  [ reversal ] .",
    "the final wd  solution was determined by simultaneously fitting the _ phoenix _ radial velocities and the @xmath29-band light curve , rectified as described above .",
    "the resulting orbital and physical parameters of 2m053505  are summarized in table  [ properties - table ] , the fit to the radial velocities shown in fig .",
    "[ rv - fig ] , the fit to the light curve displayed in fig .  [ ilc - fig ] , and the system geometry illustrated in fig .",
    "[ orbit - fig ] . with",
    "the light curve rectified , the wd  fit is now excellent ; the r.m.s .  of the residuals",
    "is 0.021 mag , comparable to the typical error on the photometric measurements (  [ lightcurve ] ) , and the goodness - of - fit is correspondingly very good , @xmath44 .    a comparison of the orbital and physical properties of 2m053505  derived from the rectified and unrectified light curves ( table  [ properties - table ] ) reveals mostly minor , statistically insignificant , differences in the fit parameters .",
    "however , a few parameters do show differences that are larger than their formal uncertainties .",
    "for example , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 differ by @xmath45 ( although these parameters are strongly correlated with one another , so their uncertainties are not independent ) , suggesting that the rectification procedure is not entirely free of small , systematic couplings to some parameters .",
    "thus , while a physical treatment of spots in the wd  model will ultimately be required to achieve full accuracy in the determination of some parmaters , the effects of spots on the most fundamental physical parameters that we derive for 2m053505the orbital parameters , in particular , and thus the component masses and radii  are probably insignificant . moreover , if other parameters remain susceptible to spot - modeling effects , these effects are evidently very subtle .",
    "we note that there exists an alternative wd  solution to the one presented in table  [ properties - table ] , with nearly identical best - fit parameters except that the component radii are reversed .",
    "formally , the goodness - of - fit of this alternative solution is inferior , with @xmath46 , but it is nonetheless acceptable .",
    "this particular type of degeneracy is a general feature of eclipsing - binary solutions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since only the component radii are significantly different in the two solutions , the degeneracy can be broken by adding the additional constraint of the luminosity ratio , which is generally very different in the two solutions . in this case , the preferred solution from table  [ properties - table ] gives an @xmath11-band luminosity ratio of @xmath47 , whereas the alternative solution gives @xmath48 . the luminosity ratio predicted by the alternative solution  in which the secondary is both warmer and larger , and thus more luminous , than the primary  is clearly inconsistent with the ratio inferred from the observed spectra , which imply @xmath49 in the @xmath11 band ( see fig .",
    "[ bf - fig ] ) .",
    "with masses of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the components of 2m053505  are proven to be _ bona fide _ brown dwarfs",
    ". moreover , with radii of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , these brown dwarfs are more comparable in their physical dimensions to young , low - mass stars than to old brown dwarfs , consistent with their being very young ( see below ) .",
    "importantly , these mass and radius measurements are distance independent . moreover",
    ", systematic errors do not appear to dominate over random measurement uncertainties (  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "thus the masses and radii of 2m053505  reported here are accurate to 8% and 3% , respectively . in",
    " [ tracks ] we make use of these measurements for an initial examination of the predictions of theoretical brown - dwarf evolutionary models .",
    "the physical properties that we have determined for the brown dwarfs in 2m053505  are surprising in at least one important respect : the less - massive secondary is hotter than the primary . specifically , we find @xmath54 ( table  [ properties - table ] ) , which follows from the relative depths of the eclipses and bolometric corrections from the model atmospheres ( blackbodies in this case ) , with small corrections for differences in occulted areas that occur due to the mildly eccentric orbit ( fig .",
    "[ orbit - fig ] ) .",
    "this finding is highly statistically significant .",
    "such a reversal of temperatures with mass is not predicted by any theoretical model for coeval brown dwarfs  in which temperature increases monotonically with mass  and thus merits closer scrutiny .",
    "here we consider the possible effects of non - blackbody atmospheres and surface spots .",
    "brown dwarf spectra deviate significantly from an ideal blackbody , due primarily to the strong wavelength dependence of molecular opacity .",
    "the corresponding redistribution of flux into or out of any specific wavelength depends on temperature , potentially affecting the ratio of eclipse depths .",
    "however , the primary and secondary of 2m053505have very similar effective temperatures (  [ spectra ] ) , so both components should have similar deviations from a blackbody .    to check this quantitatively ,",
    "we have examined up - to - date synthetic models of brown - dwarf spectra for temperatures appropriate to the components of 2m053505 . in particular",
    ", we use the solar - metallicity cond atmosphere models of @xcite . as the masses and radii of 2m053505",
    "imply @xmath55 for both components , we use the cond models with this @xmath56 value also .",
    "the cond models incorporate recent opacities , including @xmath57 million molecular lines , as well as dust formation and condensation at very low temperatures .",

    "[ speccomp - fig ] .",
    "we find that , while dramatic departures from simple blackbodies are clearly present in the model spectra , the ratio of surface brightnesses in the @xmath58 band is consistent with that predicted from simple blackbodies to within 2% , which implies a @xmath23 ratio that is consistent with the blackbody value to within 0.5% .    as an additional check , we calculated the @xmath23 s of the components of 2m053505  independently at 1.25 , 1.65 , and 2.2 @xmath10 m .",
    "we use the ratio of surface fluxes at 0.8 @xmath10 m ( measured directly from the ratio of eclipse depths in the @xmath29-band light curve ;  [ analysis ] ) and the radii ( measured directly from the eclipse durations and the orbital velocities ; table  [ properties - table ] ) , together with an assumed distance to the orion nebula cluster of 450 pc , empirical bolometric corrections from the literature @xcite , and the observed @xmath20 magnitudes at these wavelengths from @xcite : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",

    "the derived @xmath23 s are consistent with a spectral type of @xmath19m6.5 , and in all cases the reversal of temperatures persists .",
    "another potential contributor to non - blackbody spectra is the presence of hot or cold spots ( akin to solar plage or sunspots ) on the brown dwarfs , leading to spectra that derive from a combination of temperatures .",
    "cool spots have now been found to be present on many brown dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may thus be expected on one or both brown dwarfs in 2m053505  as well .",
    "indeed , we find a clear periodic signal in the out - of - eclipse portions of the @xmath29-band light curve , with a period of @xmath39 d and a semi - amplitude of @xmath68 mag (  [ spots ] ) ; almost certainly this is a rotationally modulated spot signal .",
    "such spot signals are commonly observed in the light curves of close eclipsing binaries , though modeling these effects is often a largely cosmetic exercise with little effect on the resulting stellar properties .",
    "for example , in our analysis of the young eclipsing binary @xcite , we successfully reproduced the observed out - of - eclipse light - curve variations by including spots in the light - curve model , but the derived system parameters were altered only negligibly as a result ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "on the other hand , accurate modeling of spot effects can be crucially important for the proper interpretation of certain systems .",
    "w  uma stars of the so - called  w type \" are a particularly good case in point .",
    "a defining characteristic of these systems is that the deeper eclipse corresponds to the occultation of the physically smaller and lower - mass secondary , similar to what is observed in 2m053505 .",
    "one interpretation advanced early on by @xcite is that the secondary is hotter than the primary ( typically by @xmath9 ) , perhaps due to thermal effects arising from mass- and energy - transfer in these contact systems .",
    "however , an alternate interpretation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) is that cool spots on the primary , if preferentially located along the the eclipsed latitude and more - or - less uniformly distributed in longitude , can have the effect of lowering the surface brightness of the eclipsed regions on the primary during transit by the secondary , thus making the eclipse of the primary shallower .",
    "such a model is generally very delicate in the details , and requires careful arrangement of the putative spots in order that they produce only mild ( @xmath69 mag ) out - of - eclipse variations in the light curve ; the inferred spot configurations can resemble a  leopard print \" pattern in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we are now experimenting with more sophisticated light - curve models that include the effects of spots . in the meantime , we emphasize here that the ratio of eclipsed surface brightnesses implied by our current light - curve model is robust ; the higher - mass primary really does radiate less per unit area than the secondary , at least at those surface elements that are eclipsed by the secondary .",
    "thus , in what follows , we continue to explore the implications of a temperature reversal in 2m053505 .",
    "strong evidence for the physical association of 2m053505  with the orion nebula cluster , and hence of its youth , is provided by its center - of - mass velocity .",
    "the observed value of @xmath70 km s@xmath15 ( table  [ properties - table ] ) is within 1 km s@xmath15 of the systemic radial velocity ( @xmath71 km s@xmath15 ) of kinematic members of this active star - forming region @xcite .",
    "in addition , we can derive a distance to 2m053505  by comparing the total system luminosity to its observed flux . to calculate the luminosity",
    ", we use the directly measured radii ( table  [ properties - table ] ) together with the effective temperatures and apply the stefan - boltzmann relation , @xmath72 .",
    "the adopted spectral type of m6.5@xmath730.5 for the 2m053505  primary (  [ spectra ] ) implies @xmath74  k based on recent calibrations of the @xmath23 scale for brown dwarfs @xcite , though as mentioned earlier , systematic uncertainties in the @xmath75 scale may be as large as @xmath76  k. from the measured temperature ratio of @xmath77 ( table  [ properties - table ] ) , we obtain @xmath78  k. this then gives component luminosities of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and a total system luminosity of @xmath81 . adopting an apparent magnitude of @xmath82 @xcite and bolometric corrections appropriate for the observed @xmath23 s @xcite yields a derived distance to 2m053505  of @xmath83 pc , assuming no extinction .",
    "this distance determination is consistent with the distance to the orion nebula of @xmath84 pc @xcite .",
    "the orion nebula cluster is extremely young , with an age that has been estimated to be just @xmath85 myr @xcite . with a center - of - mass velocity and distance that are both consistent with membership in this cluster ,",
    "2m053505  is probably also very young , likely having formed within the past few myr . in addition , as discussed in paper  i , the @xmath20 colors of 2m053505  place an upper limit on the extinction of @xmath86 , and thus limit the amount of remnant material available to the brown dwarfs for ongoing accretion . given",
    "the eclipsing nature of the system , any disk material would necessarily be seen edge - on and would thus produce a large amount of extinction and reddening .",
    "thus , while the colors of 2m053505  are formally consistent with a small amount of interstellar extinction and/or a small amount of remnant disk material , the currently observed masses are unlikely to change significantly over time .",
    "these brown dwarfs will likely forever remain brown dwarfs .",
    "while we expect that our ongoing analysis of 2m053505  will further improve the accuracy of the measured system parameters , the present accuracy is sufficient to permit an initial examination of theoretical brown - dwarf evolutionary models .",
    "here we consider two of the more widely used sets of tracks : those of @xcite , as recent analyses of young , low - mass stars and brown dwarfs suggest that such low - efficiency convection best matches the observed physical properties of these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "] and those of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* updated 1998 ) .",
    "these models differ in their treatment of brown - dwarf atmospheres and of energy transport ( convection ) in brown - dwarf interiors , as well as in the choice of initial conditions ( for a more in - depth discussion of differences in these models , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ models - fig ] compares the observed radii , effective temperatures , and luminosities of 2m053505  with the values theoretically predicted by these models for brown dwarfs with masses of @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( table  [ properties - table ] ) .",
    "we note first that , generally speaking , the agreement between the observed and theoretically predicted properties of 2m053505  is quite good .",
    "the models predict that these very young brown dwarfs should , at an age of @xmath24 myr , be significantly larger , warmer , and more luminous than their older counterparts  and that is in fact what we see .",
    "indeed , between 1 and 100 myr , a brown dwarf with a mass of 0.057 @xmath89 ( the mass of the 2m053505  primary ) is predicted to shrink by 500% , cool by several hundred k ( or , equivalently , go from an m spectral class to an l spectral class ) , and dim by 1.5 orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ models - fig ] ) . the recently measured radius ( @xmath90 ) of the old and low - mass ( @xmath91 ) star in the eclipsing binary system ogle - tr-122 @xcite confirms that stars with near - brown - dwarf masses have very small radii ( @xmath24 r@xmath3 ) when they are old .",
    "thus , the fact that 2m053505  comprises young brown dwarfs that are both large and luminous  and even simply that they are of m spectral class , as predicted  is a testament to the generally good predictive power of current theoretical models of brown dwarfs .    at a more detailed level ,",
    "the models of @xcite predict radii and luminosities that are more consistent with the observed values .",
    "the difference is most pronounced in the radii ; the @xcite models under - predict both radii by @xmath5 .",
    "this finding of under - predicted model radii is similar in sense and magnitude to that found from recent efforts to derive the physical properties of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs through detailed modeling of their spectra @xcite .",
    "in addition , while both sets of models perform reasonably well with respect to the observed luminosities , the agreement is somewhat better for the @xcite models ; it appears possible that more accurate measurements will reveal an under - prediction of luminosity by the @xcite models for the lower - mass secondary .",
    "but perhaps more importantly , the reversal of temperatures in 2m053505remains puzzling ; the relationship between effective temperature and mass is predicted by both sets of models to be monotonic for brown dwarfs of the same age .",
    "however , this expectation disappears for two brown dwarfs of differing age .",
    "the observed effective temperatures can be seen as consistent with the @xcite models if the primary is taken as being modestly younger than the secondary ( @xmath92 myr ) .",
    "indeed , the temperatures , radii , and luminosities of 2m053505  all remain in marginally good agreement with these models for such an age difference , at a mean age of 1 myr ( fig .  [ models2-fig ] ) , if we also adjust the observed @xmath23 scale cooler by 70 k. such a shift is well within the current systematic uncertainty of the brown - dwarf @xmath23 scale (  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "thus , a question raised by our findings is whether current brown - dwarf formation theory can accommodate a scenario in which two brown dwarfs  that are part of the same , very young , binary system  can have sufficiently different ages to allow for reversed temperatures as we have observed in 2m053505 .",
    "in truth , we have very little understanding about how binaries with components as close as those in 2m053505  are formed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( 2m053505  is , after ppl  15 in the pleiades @xcite , the shortest - period brown - dwarf binary system yet discovered ) . with a few exceptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fission seems to be ruled out . _ in situ _ mechanisms involving dynamic cloud fragmentation and disk fragmentation have not yet proven successful in creating such close binaries , but remain to be fully developed . in particular , the role of orbital migration in the presence of a massive circumbinary disk needs to be considered . certainly , if the two brown dwarfs formed together as a close binary , we have essentially no _ a priori _ expectations for whether they should be observed to be coeval to within 0.5 myr .",
    "alternatively , recent theoretical work @xcite , as well as detailed numerical simulations @xcite , suggest that dynamical interactions may be integral to the formation of brown dwarfs .",
    "the argument is essentially that strong gravitational interactions in multiple - body encounters provide a feasible mechanism for disrupting the accretion process , and thereby preventing the accumulation of mass by objects that would otherwise have become stars .",
    "this hypothesis remains under debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "still , it is tempting to speculate that the components of 2m053505  did not form together as a binary , but rather formed separately  with the primary forming later  and then were later married through a dynamical interaction . in such a scenario , it is possible that the resulting binary system  comprising two objects that were not originally formed together  may exhibit seemingly peculiar characteristics , such as the observed reversal of effective temperatures , that in fact reveal the non - coeval nature of the system .",
    "there are at least two specific scenarios involving multiple - body interactions that might pertain to the origin of 2m053505 .",
    "one involves a low - mass binary pair that interacts with a more massive third body from elsewhere in the cluster .",
    "simulations show that , if the binary is not simply broken apart by the encounter , the lower - mass member of the binary is ejected and replaced by the massive incoming object @xcite .",
    "the resulting binary would then likely consist of non - coeval members .",
    "a serious concern with this scenario in the context of 2m053505  is that it is unlikely in three - body encounters within clusters that the most massive object would have a mass of only 0.06 m@xmath7 .",
    "thus , a second scenario is that several objects formed in the fragmentation of a small molecular core , forming an unstable multiple system .",
    "the consequent rapid dynamical evolution of the system may have both terminated accretion and formed a hard binary @xcite . in such a fragmentation scenario the relative core - collapse times and evolutionary zero points might easily vary by 0.5 myr , of order the age difference needed to explain the temperature reversal of 2m053505 in the context of some evolutionary models ( fig .",
    "[ models2-fig ] ) .",
    "the position of 2m053505  might be taken as further evidence that dynamics have been important in its history . with a projected separation of 2.8 pc from the center of the orion nebula ,",
    "2m053505is situated more than 10 core radii from the center of the orion nebula cluster @xcite ; perhaps the pair was ejected from the cluster center during a dynamical encounter .",
    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion in the cluster is @xmath93 km s@xmath15 @xcite , so to reach its current position in 1 myr , if ejected from the cluster core , 2m053505  would need a somewhat higher - than - usual velocity of @xmath94 km s@xmath15 in the plane of the sky . however , the measured center - of - mass radial velocity of 2m053505does not deviate significantly from the cluster velocity .",
    "an alternative interpretation for the position of 2m053505  at the outskirts of the cluster may be that it is not a member of the cluster proper , but rather a member of the more widely distributed population of young stars in the region surrounding the orion nebula @xcite .",
    "the binary s proper motion is the critical measurement needed to establish whether 2m053505  was ejected from the cluster center .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the evolutionary tracks are deficient with respect to some critical physical ingredient(s ) .",
    "for example , the presence of strong magnetic fields on one or both brown dwarfs in 2m053505  could be affecting energy transport and thereby altering their physical structure .    indeed , recent analyses of several young , low - mass eclipsing binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate systematic discrepancies in the models . in particular , the observed effective temperatures are cooler than expected , and the observed radii larger than expected .",
    "these discrepancies are especially pronounced among the most magnetically active stars ( as traced by x - ray emission and other proxies ) .",
    "one possible interpretation is that strong magnetic fields inhibit energy transport in these otherwise fully convective stars , resulting in a decrease of the surface temperature and a corresponding increase in radius so as to radiate the same total flux @xcite .",
    "such an interpretation would be consistent with , and would help explain , the emerging observational evidence for suppressed convection in young , low - mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in this context",
    ", the temperature reversal in 2m053505  might be taken as evidence for a strong magnetic field on the higher - mass primary that is causing a sufficient decrease in its surface temperature to make it effectively cooler than the lower - mass secondary . by inference , the secondary would be interpreted as being less magnetically active .",
    "the observational evidence is strong for magnetic activity in young , low - mass stars and brown dwarfs of early- and mid - m type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , the evidence in fact shows a marked decline in magnetic activity at very late m types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that brown dwarfs with roughly the mass of the 2m053505  secondary and below are not capable of generating strong fields .",
    "the idea of a magnetically active primary would also be consistent with the primary being heavily spotted ( see  [ reversal ] ) .",
    "if we are to explain the anomalously low effective temperature of the 2m053505  primary in this way , we should then also expect its radius to be larger than theoretically predicted , as the one effect goes hand in hand with the other @xcite . as discussed above",
    "(  [ tracks ] ) , whether the 2m053505  radii agree with theoretical predictions depends on one s choice of model .",
    "the @xcite tracks do indeed suggest over - sized radii in 2m053505  ( for _ both _",
    "components ) , though this may simply reflect the truncation of those tracks at 1 myr . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xcite tracks agree with the observed radii very well ( fig .",
    "[ models - fig ] ) , with no need to invoke missing physics .",
    "2m053505  is the first known eclipsing binary system comprising two brown dwarfs . satisfying both kinematic and distance requirements for physical association with the young ( @xmath24 myr ) orion nebula cluster , 2m053505  provides the only direct , accurate measurements of the fundamental physical properties of newly formed sub - stellar objects .",
    "the masses that we measure are accurate to @xmath5 , the radii accurate to @xmath9 , the ratio of effective temperatures accurate to @xmath95 , and all are distance independent . as such",
    ", 2m053505  represents an important benchmark for theoretical models of brown - dwarf formation and evolution .",
    "encouragingly , we find that current brown - dwarf evolutionary tracks are , broadly speaking , successful in predicting the fundamental physical properties of these young brown dwarfs .",
    "more quantitatively , of the two sets of theoretical models considered here , we find that the models of @xcite yield mass - radius and mass - luminosity relationships that best agree with the empirically determined ones .",
    "the models of @xcite predict radii and luminosities that are 1.52@xmath96 smaller than the observed values .",
    "however , the reversal of component effective temperatures with mass in 2m053505  is unexpected and unexplained .",
    "we have considered here two possible interpretations of this intriguing result .",
    "the first is that the components of 2m053505  are mildly non - coeval , with the higher - mass primary being @xmath26 myr younger than the secondary .",
    "the models of @xcite are in fact consistent with the observed temperature reversal for such an age difference .",
    "a second hypothesis is that strong magnetic activity on the primary is inhibiting convection , and thereby lowering its surface temperature .",
    "neither of these interpretations is wholly satisfying , and neither is obviously discreditable .",
    "binary formation theory is largely silent on the subject of coevality at the level of @xmath26 myr , and theorists have long warned the star - formation community about the limited applicability of evolutionary track chronometry at such early ages ( the model zero - points being arbitrary in most cases ) .",
    "in addition , while the observational evidence is strong that young brown dwarfs can be magnetically active , the effects of magnetic fields on brown - dwarf structure and evolution have yet to be consistently modeled or fully understood .",
