    "in the attempt to pave the way to the realization of scalable schemes for quantum computation , much theoretical work has been recently aimed at developing suitable strategies for the efficient processing and the coherent transfer of quantum information @xcite .",
    "besides these two fundamental aspects , a further crucial requirement for the realization of scalable quantum computers is the possibility to store quantum data on time scales at least comparable to those needed for the computational process . in particular , it is very important to introduce systems acting as stable and robust quantum memories that recover and conserve large sets of quantum states that would be otherwise usually lost in very short times , due to quantum diffusion and decoherence @xcite .    to ensure stable information storage in a quantum register ,",
    "many different noise - evading schemes have been proposed @xcite .",
    "all these works can be roughly classified in two different groups : the first includes schemes based on some error correction technique .",
    "the remaining proposals exploit some intrinsic property of the quantum register that leaves some specific subsets of quantum states unaffected along the temporal evolution ( decoherence - free subspace schemes ) .",
    "these latter approaches provide , in principle , the complete solution to the problem of quantum information storage , but , unfortunately , they are extremely sensitive to almost any source of imperfection . on the contrary ,",
    "the schemes based on quantum error correction techniques are characterized by a dynamics that allows at any time the unambiguous reconstruction of the initial information .",
    "the main trouble with error correction techniques lies in the fact that usually only very few states can be effectively accessed to store information and , hence , relatively large arrays of qubits are needed to memorize relatively small amounts of information .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce a new approach to quantum state storage based on the idea of time - controlled periodic dynamics that allows a perfect , periodic reconstruction of a generic initial state . to demonstrate and describe it , let us first recall that an ideal quantum register can be considered as a set of isolated identical qubits subject to a local hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the half gap between the two energy levels of each spin@xcite .",
    "however , in realistic situations , the register is subject to noise caused by disorder in the local gap and by interactions both with the substrate environment and between the qubits .",
    "typically , at least at sufficiently low temperatures or sufficiently weak coupling with the background substrate , the interaction with the external environment takes place on time scales much slower than those associated to the computational process .",
    "for instance , in the case of quantum gate operations with hyperfine levels in trapped ions , the ratio @xmath3 can be as small as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "then , the corrupting effects that take place on the same time scales of the computational processes , and thus need to be addressed first , are those due to the unavoidable presence of the residual , deterministic and/or random inter - qubit interactions @xcite .",
    "these interactions cause , in general , fast quantum diffusion and , as a consequence , the complete corruption of the information one wishes to store and process . therefore ,",
    "even before considering the effects of thermal and environmental decoherence , realistic quantum registers in the presence of irreducible noise and imperfections must be described by hamiltonians of the form @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the residual inter - qubit hamiltonian . in several physical situations",
    ", it can be described by @xmath0 interaction terms : @xmath7 where the random variables of vanishing mean @xmath8 are the local imperfections in the global , averaged nearest - neighbor coupling amplitude @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "such a site - dependent @xmath0 model applies immediately to spin-@xmath11 based quantum registers ( such as in nmr devices ) , but gives as well an effective description of a register based on hopping and/or interacting particles on a lattice , in the presence of an energy gap such that only two local states on each lattice site can be considered @xcite , so that the material particles are mapped in spin-@xmath11 systems .",
    "the storing scheme that we shall describe in the present work holds in general for many classes of inter - qubit interaction hamiltonians , for instance @xmath12 interactions , but in a more limited range of validity when dealing with imperfections @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will restrict our analysis to physical systems and regimes such that the residual inter - qubit couplings can be well described by @xmath0 interaction hamiltonians , including local imperfections .    as already mentioned , the presence of @xmath6 , even if @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 , rapidly destroys the storing capacity of the register : immediately after having stored an _ initial state _",
    "@xmath16 , such state starts to evolve and diffuse indefinitely .",
    "to illustrate and measure this effect , we can follow the behaviour of the time - dependent two - dimensional overlap @xmath17 for different stored initial states and physical situations @xcite .",
    "let us then consider a closed ( periodic boundary conditions ) , unmodulated chain with @xmath0 nearest neighbour residual interactions between the spins , and let us introduce the set of one - magnon , locally excited states @xmath18 where the product involves all the qubits of the register except the one at site @xmath19 . in fig .",
    "1 we take the initial state @xmath20 to be @xmath21 , i.e. the one - magnon excitation placed on site @xmath22 , while in fig .",
    "2 the initial state is taken to be the linear combination with equal weights of one - magnon excitations placed on sites @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    , starting from the initial state @xmath21 , as a function of the distance @xmath19 from site @xmath25 ( @xmath26-axis ) and of the dimensionless time @xmath27 in atomic units @xmath28 ( @xmath29-axis ) . here",

    "the value of the overlap increases from white ( @xmath34 ) to black ( @xmath35).,width=283 ]    by looking both at fig .",
    "( [ figura1a ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ figura1b ] ) , we see that , irrespective of the different set of physical parameter and stored states one considers , the quantum state diffusion grows indefinitely in time and the initial state is never recovered at any site of the lattice .",
    "consequently , the one - dimensional fidelity of the initially stored state at a fixed position @xmath19 in the lattice quickly decrease , undergoing partial revivals , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ figura1c ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that in a non modulated register the fidelity of an initial superposition is more robust against quantum diffusion .",
    "this intrinsic property is helpful in the case of modulated ( controlled ) registers .     at fixed lattice site @xmath22 , as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath27 for different initially stored states .",
    "the solid line represents the evolution of the fidelity with initial state taken to be the single - magnon excitation @xmath21 localized at site @xmath22 .",
    "the dashed line represents the evolution of the one - dimensional fidelity for the initial superposition state @xmath33 .",
    "notice that superpositions are more robust against quantum diffusion than non - superpositional , localized excitations.,width=283 ]",
    "to overcome this major obstacle in the construction of _ prima facie _ working models of a quantum register we will introduce a _ global _ ( that is , site - independent ) control of the total hamiltonian @xmath36 able to force a periodic time reconstruction of the initial state . in the presence of a generic time - dependent hamiltonian , evolution of a quantum state can be determined in the most general terms by resorting to the dyson series representation .",
    "obviously , the structural complexity of the dyson evolution integral does not allow to identify all the possible hamiltonian dynamical evolutions yielding perfect , time - periodic quantum state reconstruction .",
    "however , the dyson series can be easily resummed when the hamiltonian enjoys the property to self - commute at different times : @xmath37=0 $ ] for all @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , our first prescription concerns a quantum register described by a time - periodic modulated hamiltonian , commuting at all times , either when applied to all possible states , or for a subspace of the whole hilbert space of states .    under the time - commutation hypothesis , we can determine a complete set of states @xmath40 that are eigenstates of the time - dependent hamiltonian at all times even if the corresponding energy eigenvalues are time - dependent functions @xmath41 .",
    "because the energy eigenstates form a complete basis set , the initial state @xmath20 can be written as a linear combination : @xmath42 , with @xmath43=@xmath44 , and the sum runs over the complete set of eigenstates .",
    "it is then simple to write the evolution of the initial state after a time @xmath45 , @xmath46 from eq .",
    "( [ evoluzione ] ) it is immediate to see that if at a certain time @xmath47 all the integrals in the sum are equal or differ from each other by integer multiples of @xmath48 , then the initial state @xmath20 is perfectly reconstructed , but for an irrelevant global phase factor .",
    "this is then the second requirement that one needs to impose on the time - modulated dynamics in order to realize perfect time - periodic quantum state storage .",
    "these two basic requirements can be implemented successfully for spin systems with @xmath0 interactions by a scheme of quantum control based on time - inverted dynamical evolutions realized by suitably engineered time - dependent global phase factors .",
    "we then consider the following situation . in the presence of a simple geometry realized by placing a tiny solenoid in the center of a circular ring ( periodic boundary conditions ) of spins sitting at regularly spaced lattice sites , all the nearest - neighbor interaction amplitudes become complex by acquiring the same site - independent , global phase @xmath49 proportional to the magnetic flux @xmath50 linked to the ring : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the total number of qubits in the ring . the solenoid field",
    "can then be modulated in time to achieve the control needed for perfect quantum state storage . in the presence of a time - variable linked flux , the total hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ generichamiltonian ] ) becomes time - dependent and reads : @xmath53 incidentally , we note that this scheme can apply as well to more general systems of hopping material particles , thanks to the `` peierls '' effect , i.e. the fact that if charged particles are in the presence of a linked magnetic flux , the real - valued hopping amplitude between particles ( in spin language , the nearest - neighbor coupling ) , is transformed in a complex - valued quantity @xcite .",
    "clearly , not all time modulations of the phase factor can realize the desired perfect state storage . the first constraint to be imposed is commutativity at different times :",
    "@xmath54=0 $ ] .",
    "this property is verified if and only if @xmath55 , with @xmath56 integer .",
    "this implies that during the entire time evolution the phase must be modulated in regular periodic jumps ( steps ) between two constant values @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( step - phase modulation ) .    concerning the property that at a certain given time @xmath59 , all the time integrals appearing in the expression eq .",
    "( [ evoluzione ] ) must be equal ( or differ by a trivial phase factor integer multiple of @xmath60 ) , let us observe that , independently of the values of @xmath49 , the local term @xmath61 ( ideal register ) commutes with the @xmath0 residual interaction terms in the time - dependent hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ controlledhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "hence , there exists a complete set of eigenstates of @xmath62 that are as well simultaneous eigenstates of both the local and the interaction terms .",
    "then , for all eigenvalues @xmath63 associated to the eigenstates @xmath64 , we have that : @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are , respectively , the interaction and the local contributions to the energy . on the other hand , when @xmath49 passes from the value @xmath57 to @xmath58 , the coupling contribution to the energy changes sign while the local one remains unchanged , so that @xmath68 . therefore , any two energy eigenvalues @xmath69 and @xmath70 corresponding to the same eigenstate @xmath64 , differ only in the sign of the interaction component .",
    "then , selecting a regular step time modulation of the phase of the form @xmath71 periodically repeated for any @xmath72 , we obtain that the contribution of the residual interaction hamiltonian to the quantum state time evolution vanishes at any time @xmath73 with @xmath74 arbitrary integer .",
    "consequently , the effects of the undesired , residual interqubit @xmath0 interactions on the quantum register are completely eliminated , _ even in the presence of local , static imperfections in the couplings_. moreover , the result is valid for _ any kind _ of distribution of the noise on the couplings , be it gaussian , or uniform , or any other probability distributution .",
