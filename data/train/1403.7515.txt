    "utiyama showed @xcite that important general relativistic aspects of the interaction of gravity with matter could be arrived at by generalizing the space - time independent coordinate transformations of special relativity to local ones .",
    "these results were later extended by kibble @xcite using the complete poincar group .",
    "more recently capozziello and de laurentis @xcite have shown that general gauge theories of gravity can be derived from local poincar symmetry . unlike the approach followed in @xcite , the present work derives a theory of the interaction of gravity with particles described by covariant wave equations by taking advantage of a restriction to global phase invariance suggested by the covariant wave equations themselves .",
    "the solution discussed in this section does in fact contain gravity in a space - time dependent phase which is the fundamental ingredient of any gauge theory .",
    "the case of a particle described by a klein - gordon equation is considered in detail , but similar conclusions can be reached starting from other known wave equations .",
    "covariant wave equations that apply to particles with , or without spin , have solutions @xcite that are exact to first order in the metric deviation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the minkowski metric , and have been applied to problems like geometrical optics @xcite , interferometry and gyroscopy @xcite , the spin - flip of particles in gravitational and inertial fields @xcite , radiative processes @xcite and spin currents @xcite .",
    "it is useful to re - derive here the solution of the klein - gordon equation that , neglecting curvature dependent terms and applying the lanczos - de donder condition @xmath2 becomes to @xmath3 @xmath4\\phi(x)=0\\,.\\ ] ] the notations and units ( @xmath5 ) are as in @xcite .",
    "the solution of ( [ kg ] ) is obtained by solving the volterra equation @xmath6 along the particle world - line , where @xmath7 is a fixed reference point , @xmath8 a generic point in the physical future along the world - line , @xmath9 is the causal green function with @xmath10 .",
    "the free klein - gordon equation is @xmath11 in first approximation @xmath12 can be substituted for @xmath13 in ( [ v ] ) and the integrations can then be carried out using the equations @xmath14 from which @xmath15 can be obtained , and @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) can be proven by straightforward differentiation .",
    "the latter is the four - dimensional extension of a known formula @xcite .",
    "to @xmath19 the solution of ( [ kg ] ) is @xmath20 where the operator @xmath21 is defined as @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the momentum of the plane wave solution @xmath26 of ( [ kg0 ] ) satisfying @xmath27 .",
    "the solution _ is independent of any field equations for @xmath28_. equations ( [ so ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) are the byproduct of covariance ( minimal coupling ) and , ultimately , of lorentz invariance and can therefore be applied to general relativity , in particular to theories in which acceleration has an upper limit @xcite and that therefore allow the resolution of astrophysical @xcite and cosmological singularities in quantum theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "they also are relevant to those theories of asymptotically safe gravity that can be expressed as einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath13 can be extended to any order in @xmath28 , but the results can not be summed up in closed form .",
    "in fact , the solution can be written in the form @xmath29 where @xcite @xmath30 @xmath31\\phi_{(h-1)}(x)\\,.\\ ] ] any possible non - linearities present in the wave equation can be treated as perturbations , where applicable @xcite .",
    "the results also apply , with appropriate changes , to all known covariant wave equations @xcite .",
    "by substituting ( [ so ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) in ( [ kg ] ) one finds that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 it follows that the particle momentum is @xmath34 . by using ( [ pm ] ) , one can also write @xmath35k^{\\beta}\\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38k^{\\beta}\\,.\\ ] ] in the form ( [ nabla ] ) of the covariant derivative , the two - point vector @xmath39 plays the role of the vector potential in electromagnetism .",
    "the definition of @xmath40 given by ( [ k ] ) contains a reference to matter through the momentum @xmath41 of @xmath26 .",
    "the inclusion of the coupling to matter in @xmath40 does not however create problems in a theory of particle - gravity interactions and offers the benefits of dealing with completely gauge invariant quantities ( section 4 ) .",
    "the equations satisfied by @xmath40 relative to the base point @xmath42 can now be obtained by differentiating ( [ k ] ) with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "one finds @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the linearized riemann tensor satisfying the identity @xmath46 and @xmath47 $ ] is the angular momentum about the base point @xmath42 .",
    "the physical origin of the base event in the two - point tensors ( [ k ] ) and ( [ f ] ) is closely linked to @xmath48 .",
    "the latter tensor would of course contain also the intrinsic angular momentum when referring to particles with spin .",
    "maxwell - type equations @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be obtained from ( [ f ] ) using the bianchi identities @xmath51 .",
    "the current @xmath52 satisfies the conservation law @xmath53 .",
    "one finds in particular that the `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' components of @xmath54 are @xmath55 equations ( [ me1 ] ) and ( [ me2 ] ) are identities and do not represent additional constraints on @xmath28 .",
    "the recombination of ten @xmath28 into four @xmath56 may be regarded as an example of hidden symmetry made manifest by the covariance of the wave equation , hence the interaction of the particle with @xmath28 .",
    "knowledge of @xmath28 is still needed in order to calculate @xmath40 and that requires the solution of ten equations .",
    "one needs in fact the fifteen components @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 to determine @xmath64 and the six components @xmath65 to calculate @xmath66 .",
    "the sum must be decreased by one because @xmath67 and the total , twenty , corresponds to the number of independent components of the riemann tensor . in general , therefore , all @xmath28 are required in order to determine @xmath54 .",
    "the somewhat inverse approach , whereby gravitons are constructed as photon bound states , is discussed in @xcite .",
    "conservation laws are better expressed geometrically in integral form .",
    "several of them are derived in a purely classical context in @xcite using world function and two - point tensor formalisms .",
    "it is shown in particular that for any skew - symmetric tensor @xmath68 and any closed two - space @xmath69 in space - time spanned by an open @xmath70 one has @xmath71 on substituting @xmath54 for @xmath68 and taking ( [ me1 ] ) into account , ( [ sy ] ) gives @xmath72 which states that the flux of @xmath48 relative to a base point @xmath42 out of a closed surface vanishes .",
    "the same result can be obtained by integrating @xmath56 over a closed @xmath73 spanned by an open @xmath74 and letting @xmath73 shrink to a point .",
    "it also follows that , when the wave function is nodal , the flux of @xmath56 @xmath75 is quantized .",
    "finally , the same procedure applied to @xmath76 gives @xmath77 and , by contracting @xmath78 to a point and using bianchi identities , @xmath79j^{\\alpha\\beta } + 2r_{\\mu\\beta,\\nu}k^{\\beta}\\right]d\\tau^{\\mu\\nu}=0\\,,\\ ] ] that again states that the total flux of angular momentum and momentum out of a closed @xmath74 vanishes .",
    "since @xmath74 can be chosen arbitrarily small and @xmath52 is conserved , one concludes that the total flux of momentum and angular momentum is conserved locally .",
    "this is shown in @xcite to be a necessary ingredient of gauge theories of gravity .",
    "it appears here in a context still independent of any choice of gravitational field equations .",
    "local conservation requires the introduction of the field @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding force field is represented by ( [ f ] ) that contains curvature in an essential way .",
    "there are two types of `` gauge '' transformations at play in what follows .",
    "first are those that follow from ( [ f ] ) and leave @xmath54 invariant under the changes @xmath80 it also follows from ( [ nabla ] ) and ( [ gt ] ) that @xmath81 .",
    "these are the usual gauge transformations one must expect in a theory formally analogous to electromagnetism with symmetry group @xmath82 .",
    "they can also be used to eliminate redundant terms from the equations , as follows . differentiating ( [ k ] ) twice with respect to @xmath83 one finds @xmath84k^{\\beta}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the last term can be eliminated from ( [ x ] ) by using ( [ gt ] ) with @xmath87 . the corresponding equation for @xmath88 can be obtained by differentiating ( [ f ] ) and using ( [ l ] ) @xmath89\\left(x^{\\alpha}-z^{\\alpha}\\right)k^{\\beta}\\ ] ] @xmath90 and is invariant under ( [ gt ] ) .",
    "the second instance in which the term `` gauge transformation '' is traditionally used is related to the fact that ( [ l ] ) does not determine the coordinates completely .",
    "the additional , allowable transformations @xmath91 , where @xmath92 are first order quantities , induce the changes @xmath93 because @xmath40 contains @xmath28 explicitly , one must ascertain that @xmath40 and the equations it satisfies behave in a way that is consistent with ( [ gg ] ) and ( [ gt ] ) .",
    "one finds that ( [ gg ] ) still leaves ( [ x ] ) invariant provided @xmath94 and affects @xmath40 in a way consistent with ( [ gt ] ) .",
    "in fact , by applying ( [ gg ] ) to @xmath40 one obtains @xmath95 as required by ( [ f ] ) .",
    "bel suggested @xcite an alternative way to strengthen the analogy between electromagnetism and linearized gravity by introducing the tensor @xmath96 that also satisfies maxwell - type equations .",
    "however @xmath97 transforms under ( [ gg ] ) as @xmath98 and is not therefore a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "interesting results can nonetheless be obtained by restricting ( [ gg ] ) to the special functions @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "this additional restriction is , of course , unnecessary when dealing with @xmath40 and @xmath100 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath101 and that the wave propagates in the direction characterized by the wave vector @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "then ( [ l ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) provide , among the surviving components , the relations @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "one finds @xmath105 -k^3\\left[\\left(ip_3 + ip_0\\right)\\left(x^0 -z^0\\right)-1\\right]\\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath106 -k^3\\left[\\left(ip_3 + ip_0\\right)\\left(x^0 -z^0\\right)-1\\right]\\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] it then follows from @xmath107 that the helicity is @xmath108 . on the contrary @xmath109",
    "depend only on @xmath110 and @xmath111 with helicity zero .",
    "pursuing the `` electromagnetic '' analogy , one can also derive the equations of motion of a classical particle . on account of ( [ f ] ) and writing @xmath112 , one finds @xmath113 which is the equation of geodesic deviation .",
    "similarly , the equation that relates the torque to the change in angular momentum is @xmath114",
    "the main results are summarized below .",
    "any linear theory of gravity whose interaction with quantum particles is described by a covariant wave equation leads to a vector theory in which angular momentum and momentum are conserved locally .",
    "the ten components of @xmath115 regroup to form a two - point vector @xmath116 that satisfies maxwell - type equations identically . _",
    "the result is independent of the choice of any particular set of field equations for the metric tensor _ and therefore applies to a variety of theories of gravity , in particular to general relativity and to caianiello s theory of maximal acceleration . in general , knowledge of @xmath116",
    "still requires knowledge of all components of @xmath115 .",
    "the construction of @xmath117 can be extended to all orders of approximation in the metric deviation .",
    "the field @xmath40 renders the local conservation of angular momentum and momentum possible .",
    "this is borne out of the integral laws ( [ con1 ] ) and ( [ j1 ] ) that state that the flux of @xmath118 across a closed @xmath74 is conserved .",
    "this is a general feature of gauge theories of gravity that follows @xcite from local poincar symmetry . if , in particular , the particle wave function is nodal , then the flux of @xmath56 out of an open @xmath69 is quantized .",
    "all results are invariant under the transformations ( [ gt ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) and can not therefore be an artifact of the choice of coordinates . in the case",
    "@xmath115 represents a gravitational wave , the helicity of @xmath116 is that expected of a ( not necessarily free ) vector field .",
    "the `` electromagnetic '' analogy can also be pursued at the level of the particle equations of motion .",
    "it yields in this instance the equation of geodesic deviation and a generalized torque - change of angular momentum relation .",
