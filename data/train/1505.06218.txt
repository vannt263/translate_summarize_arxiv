    "in beam - driven techniques , a high - charge `` drive '' bunch passes through a high - impedance medium and experiences a decelerating field  @xcite . the resulting energy loss can be transferred to a properly delayed `` witness '' bunch trailing the drive bunch .",
    "a critical parameter associated to this class of acceleration method is the transformer ratio @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the maximum accelerating field behind the drive bunch , and @xmath4 is the maximum decelerating field within the drive bunch .    generally the transformer ratio is limited to values @xmath5 due to the fundamental beam - loading theorem  @xcite .",
    "however larger values can be produced using drive bunches with tailored ( asymmetric ) current profiles .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that both @xmath6 and @xmath3 for a given charge are maximized when the decelerating field over the drive bunch is constant  @xcite .",
    "additionally , bunch current profiles that minimize the accumulated energy spread within the drive bunch are desirable as they enable transport of the drive bunch over longer distances .",
    "+ to date , several current profiles capable of generating transformer ratios @xmath7 have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "these include linearly ramped profiles combined with a door - step or exponential initial distribution  @xcite .",
    "more recently a piecewise  double - triangle \" current profile was suggested as an alternative with the advantage of being experimentally realizable  @xcite . a main limitation common to all these shapes resides in their discontinuous character which make their experimental realization either challenging or relying on complicated beam - manipulation techniques  @xcite . in addition these shapes",
    "are often foreseen to be formed in combination with an interceptive mask  @xcite which add further challenges when combined with high - repetition - rate linacs  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we introduce several smooth current profiles which support large transformer ratios and lead to quasi - constant decelerating fields across the drive bunch .",
    "we describe a simple scheme for realizing one of these shapes in a photoemission radiofrequecy ( rf ) electron source employing a shaped photocathode - laser pulse .",
    "finally , we discuss a possible injector configuration that could form drive bunches consistent with the multi - user free - electron laser ( fel ) studied in ref .",
    "for simplicity we consider a wakefield - assisting medium ( e.g. a plasma or a dielectric - lined waveguide ) that supports an axial wakefield described by the green s function  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the loss factor and @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the wavelength of the considered mode . here",
    "@xmath12 ( in our convention ) is the distance behind the source particle responsible for the wakefield . in this section",
    "we do not specialize to any wakefield mechanism and recognize that , depending on the assisting medium used to excite the wakefield , many modes might be excited so that the green s function would consequently consist of a summation over these modes .    given the green s function , the voltage along and behind a bunch with axial charge distribution @xmath13 can be obtained from the convolution  @xcite @xmath14 we take @xmath13 to be non vanishing on two intervals @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] and zero elsewhere . in our convention the bunch head starts at @xmath17 and the tail population lies at @xmath18 .",
    "we also constrain our search to functions such that @xmath13 and @xmath19 are continuous at @xmath20 . introducing the function @xmath21 ( to be specified later )",
    ", we write the charge distribution as @xmath22      based on our previous work  @xcite we first consider the following function @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are positive constants , @xmath26 is again the spatial frequency seen above , and @xmath27 is an integer . consequently , using eq .",
    "[ eq : genramp ] , the axial bunch profile is written as @xmath28 in this section we report only on solutions pertaining to @xmath29 .",
    "additional , albeit more complicated , solutions also exist for larger @xmath30 ; however , these solutions lead to additional oscillations which ultimately lowers the transformer ratio .",
    "+ from eq .",
    "[ eq : wakepot ] , the decelerating field then takes the form    @xmath31    the oscillatory part in the tail ( @xmath32 ) can be eliminated under the condition @xmath33    which leads to the following decelerating and accelerating fields respectively @xmath34    @xmath35    finally , the transformer ratio can be calculated by taking the ratio of the maximum accelerating field ( see appendix  [ app : a ] ) over the maximum decelerating field which yields    @xmath36    two sets of solutions occur for even and odd @xmath37 which can be interpreted as a phase shift in the oscillatory part . additionally ,",
    "larger multiples of even and odd @xmath37 lead to more oscillations in the head which ultimately reduce the transformer ratio . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinramp ] we illustrate the simplest even ( a ) and odd ( b ) solutions corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",

    "[ fig : quadratic ] we illustrate an example of the quadratic shape ( green trace ) as well as its corresponding longitudinal electric field ( blue trace ) for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we now turn to compare the smooth longitudinal shapes from the previous section with the doorstep  @xcite and double - triangle  @xcite which also provide constant decelerating fields over the bunch - tail ( see appendix  [ app : b ] for our formulation of these distributions ) . for a fair comparison ,",
    "we stress the importance of comparing the various current profiles with equal charge .",
    "consequently , we normalize each of the current profile to the same bunch charge @xmath55 where @xmath24 is the scaling parameter associated with each bunch shape ( see section  [ sec : theory ] and appendix  [ app : b ] ) , and @xmath56 is the total bunch length which is assumed to be larger than the given shape s bunch - head length ( @xmath57 ) . for each distribution , the charge normalization generates a relationship between @xmath24 and @xmath58 which enables us to rexpress @xmath6 in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath24 . in tab .",

    "we also added the linear - ramp and gaussian distributions .",
    "the results indicate that all of the distributions with constant decelerating fields over the bunch - tail ` live ' on the same curve ; additionally , by varying the scaling parameter @xmath24 for a distribution , you can shift a distribution to have a larger ( resp .",

    "@xmath3 ) and vice - versa .",
    "ultimately , this suggests that the distribution which is simplest to make is as useful as any other and it can be scaled accordingly ( @xmath6 , @xmath3 ) for a specific application .",

    "a simple estimate indicates that our drive bunch would require a dwfa linac of @xmath63  m in order to accelerate an incoming 350-mev witness bunch to a final energy of @xmath64  gev .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a set of smooth current profiles for beam - driven acceleration which display comparable performances with more complex discontinuous shapes discussed in previous work .",
    "we find that all proposed current profiles which lead to uniform decelerating fields `` live '' on the same performance curve and that a given profile can be scaled to a particular accelerating field or transformer ratio .",
