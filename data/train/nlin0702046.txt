    "the out - degrees @xmath64 of all the vertices of the randomized directed graph on which is defined the new dynamical system are all equal , that is , for all @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 do not take into account the links @xmath69 . on the other hand ,",
    "the in - degree of a given vertex is a random variable @xmath70 that can be written as the sum @xmath71 of two independent binomial random variables .",
    "@xmath72 corresponds to the number of original incoming links that have not been reconnected to another vertex during the randomization process , and @xmath73 to the number of new incoming links .",
    "the generating function @xmath74 of @xmath70 is , therefore , given by @xmath75 as mentioned above , @xmath13 is the size of the original one - dimensional ca ( i.e. , the number of vertices of the graph ) supposed to be large .",
    "hence , the average value and the variance of @xmath70 are @xmath76 if @xmath13 is large and @xmath58 is not too small ,",
    "i.e. , if @xmath77 is large , then @xmath73 is well - approximated by a poisson random variable of parameter @xmath78 .    if , after randomization , the neighborhood @xmath79 , the state @xmath80 of vertex @xmath8 at time @xmath26 is given by @xmath81 translational invariance , which a characteristic property of regular cas , is lost .",
    "for a given value of the randomizing probability @xmath58 , statistical averages over many different randomized graphs evolving according to a given rule @xmath16 should tend , as @xmath58 increases , towards values predicted by the mean - field approximation applied to the corresponding regular ca .",
    "we shall see in the next section that this not always the case . in this section",
    "we first present a few ca families that exhibit this mean - field behavior .",
    "a global ca rule @xmath37 is surjective if any configuration @xmath82 has a preimage .",
    "this implies @xmath83 .",
    "for a two - state ca , it can be shown  @xcite that all blocks of zeros and ones of a given length have exactly the same number of preimages . as a consequence ,",
    "the average value of the density of ones is equal to @xmath84 . since this result",
    "is correctly predicted by the mean - field approximation , the randomization process should have no effect on the value of the average density of ones which should be equal to @xmath84 for all values of @xmath58 .",
    "there exist 30 elementary surjective ca rules .",
    "six of them ( rules 15 , 51 , 85 , 170 , 204 , and 240 ) are trivial in the sense that their ca rules @xmath85 are functions of one variable only . for the remaining 24 rules ( rules 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 86 , 89 , 90 , 101 , 102 , 105 , 106 , 120 , 135 , 149 , 150 , 153 , 154 , 165 , 166 , 169 , 180 , 195 , 210 , and 225 ) we verify that the randomization process , while it destroys the structure of the spatiotemporal pattern , does not change the value of the density of ones , equal to @xmath84 for all values of @xmath58 .",
    "it can also be verified that , for not very large ca size ( 1000 ) , even the statistics of blocks of various lengths also appears to be independent of @xmath58 .",
    "ca rule 54 is defined by the following map @xmath86 rule 54 is one of the most complex elementary ca .",
    "its temporal evolution is very slow .",
    "it is found that the density of ones tends towards its asymptotic value ( exactly @xmath84 ) as @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "its spatiotemporal pattern may be viewed as particlelike structures ( defects ) of 4 different types evolving in a regular background ( figure  [ fig : ca54defects ] ) .",
    "these particles present a rich variety of interactions  @xcite which has received a very nice group - theoretical interpretation due to b. martin  @xcite .",
    "these particles move in a periodic background whose space and time periods are both equal to 4 .",
    "this background can be viewed as a square lattice whose elementary cell is the @xmath88 tile : @xmath89    _ the four different particles found in the spatiotemporal pattern of ca54 . _ ]    _ pairs of @xmath90-particles radiating @xmath91-particles .",
    "_ ]    the definition of the @xmath88 tile is not unique .",
    "there are actually 8 different @xmath88 tiles according to the 8 possible choices of the first row that are  @xcite : @xmath92 tile  [ b11tile ] corresponds to background @xmath93 . as shown by martin , the different particles appear as frontiers between different backgrounds , and can be labeled by the elements of the translation group of the regular background .",
    "if , starting from a configuration belonging to the limit set , we rewire one edge ( replacing @xmath94 by @xmath95 with @xmath96 ) , after a few iterations ( whose number depends upon the states of the vertices located in the vicinity of vertex @xmath97 ) we may obtain very different results .",
    "in particular , as shown in figure  [ fig : radwalls ] , we may observe rather complicated structures associated to @xmath90-particles continuously radiating pairs of @xmath91-particles ( on particles nomenclature refer to  @xcite ) .",
    "note , on the right figure , the existence of a pair of new defects appearing after one iteration .",
    "increasing the randomizing probability @xmath58 eventually destroys the regular spatiotemporal pattern of ca 54 . starting from a random configuration",
    ", the structure of the spatiotemporal pattern in the infinite time limit clearly shows that the asymptotic value of the density of ones is equal @xmath84 . this result",
    "is correctly predicted by the mean - field approximation but , since the evolution of ca 54 is extremely slow , it takes a very large number of iterations to approach this limit . increasing the probability @xmath58 , notably increases the convergence towards this limit .      for a given value of the randomizing probability @xmath58 , statistical averages over many different randomized graphs evolving according to a given rule @xmath16 should tend , as @xmath58 increases , towards values predicted by the mean - field approximation applied to the corresponding regular ca .",
    "this is the case of rca 18 .",
    "rule 18 is defined by the following map @xmath98 the temporal evolution of ca 18 is well understood and rather simple .",
    "configurations belonging to the limit set consist of sequences of zeros of odd lengths separated by isolated ones .",
    "the average number of sequences of length @xmath99 per vertex is equal to @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "this implies that , in the limit of large @xmath13 , the fraction of ones of a configuration belonging to the limit set is exactly equal to @xmath101 . in the spatiotemporal pattern a sequence of two ones or",
    "a sequence of zeros of even length is a _",
    "defect_. since two sequences of zeros of odd lengths separated by two neighboring ones generate , at the next time step , a sequence of zeros of even length , configurations generated by rule 18 contain defects of one type only . during the evolution",
    "these defects behave as moving particles .",
    "they perform pseudo random walks and annihilate pairwise when they meet .",
    "this process has been studied by grassberger  @xcite who found that , starting from a random initial configuration , the density of defects decreases as @xmath102 .",
    "if , following  @xcite , we view these defects as particlelike structures evolving in the background represented by the spatiotemporal pattern generated by configurations belonging to the limit set , the pairwise annihilation may be viewed as the annihilation of a particle - antiparticle pair , the antiparticle , in this case , being identical to the particle .    if , starting from a configuration belonging to the limit set , we rewire only one edge , that is , we replace , for instance , the edge @xmath94 by the edge @xmath95 , where @xmath103 , after a few iterations ( whose number depends upon the states of the vertices located in the vicinity of vertex @xmath97 ) , a pair of defects is created close to site @xmath8 . as a consequence of the structure of the limit set of ca rule 18 , it is not possible to create a single defect , only pairs of defects may be created .",
    "rewiring randomly more vertices creates more defects , some being of a type not found in the spatiotemporal pattern of ca 18 , and eventually the structure of this pattern is completely destroyed .",
    "the asymptotic value of the fraction of ones varies as a function of the randomizing probability @xmath58 ( figure  [ fig : rca18densities ] ) . for @xmath104 , which corresponds to maximum disorder ,",

    "this result , which is valid for all number - conserving rules , could suggest that the density of ones should not be affected by the randomization process , i.e. , the density of ones should , at least in the steady state , remain constant .",
    "our numerical simulations show that this is not the case : the steady state behavior is extremely dependent upon the graph structure .    for a given value of the randomizing probability @xmath58 ,",
