    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) paradigm of quark mixing in the standard model ( sm ) is yet to be accurately tested in the @xmath2 sector , and it is quite possible that the np can affect the @xmath2 system while keeping the @xmath9 system untouched . indeed , for most of the flavor - dependent np models , the couplings relevant for the second and third generations of sm fermions are much less constrained than those for the first generation fermions , allowing the np to play a significant role in the @xmath2 mixing , in principle .",
    "over the last few years , the tevatron experiments cdf and d  , and to a smaller extent the b factories belle and babar , have provided a lot of data on the @xmath10 meson , most of which are consistent with the sm .",
    "there are some measurements , though , which show a significant deviation from the sm expectations , and hence point towards new physics ( np ) .",
    "the major ones among these are the following .",
    "( i ) measurements in the decay mode @xmath0 yield a large cp - violating phase @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in addition , though the difference @xmath12 between the decay widths of the mass eigenstates measured in this decay is consistent with the sm , it allows @xmath6 values that are almost twice the sm prediction , and also opposite in sign @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the like - sign dimuon asymmetry @xmath1 in the combined @xmath13 data at d   @xcite is almost @xmath14 away from the sm expectation .",
    "the resolutions of the above anomalies , separately or simultaneously , have been discussed in the context of specific np models : a scalar leptoquark model @xcite , models with an extra flavor - changing neutral gauge boson @xmath15 or r - parity violating supersymmetry @xcite , two - higgs doublet model @xcite , models with a fourth generation of fermions @xcite , supersymmetric grand unified models @xcite , supersymmetric models with split sfermion generations @xcite or models with a very light spin-1 particle @xcite .",
    "possible four - fermion effective interactions that are consistent with the data have been analyzed by @xcite and the results are consistent with @xcite .",
    "similar studies , based on the minimal flavor violating ( mfv ) models @xcite , and the randall - sundrum model @xcite , have been carried out .    in this paper",
    ", we try to determine , in a model - independent way , which kind of np would be able to account for both the above anomalies simultaneously .",
    "we take a somewhat different approach than the references cited above . rather than confining ourselves to specific models , we assume that the np responsible for the anomalies contributes entirely through the @xmath2 mixing , and parameterize it in a model independent manner through the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath2 mixing .",
    "this effective hamiltonian @xmath16 is a @xmath17 matrix in the flavor basis , and the relevant np contribution appears in its off - diagonal elements .",
    "the np can then be parameterized by using four parameters : the magnitudes and phases of the dispersive part and the absorptive part of the np contribution to @xmath16 .",
    "a `` scatter - plot '' analysis that constrained these four new parameters using only @xmath1 has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "we perform a @xmath18 fit to the @xmath2 mixing observables and obtain a quantitative measure for which kind of np is preferred by the data .",
    "this would lead us to shortlist specific np models that have the desired properties , which can give testable predictions for other experiments .",
    "it is found that the np needs to contribute to both the dispersive as well as absorptive part of the hamiltonian in order to avoid any tension with the data .",
    "we also extend our framework to include possible cpt violation in the @xmath2 mixing , parameterized through the difference in diagonal elements of @xmath16 .",
    "the motivation is to check if this can obviate the need for an absorptive contribution from the np .",
    "such an analysis to constrain cpt and lorentz violating parameters was carried out in @xcite .",
    "however they have used only @xmath1 and not @xmath7 in their analysis , and their parameters are only indirectly connected to the elements of @xmath16 .",
    "we try to account for the two anomalies above with only cpt violation as the source of np , and with a combination of cpt violation and the np contribution to the off - diagonal elements of @xmath16 .",
    "as we will show , nothing improves the fit significantly from the sm unless there is a nonzero absorptive part in the @xmath2 mixing amplitude .",

    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that such a nonzero absorptive part that arises naturally in these class of models can enhance @xmath6 significantly above its sm value , contrary to the popular expectations based on @xcite .",
    "one notes that a new absorptive part in the mixing amplitude necessarily means new final states that can be accessed by both @xmath10 and @xmath35 .",
    "the data from the direct measurements of branching ratios is extremely restrictive @xcite , apart from that for a few final states like @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "as we shall see later in this paper , such models are favored by the @xmath2 mixing data .",

    "one may question the optimistic sm uncertainty for @xmath114 as quoted in eq .",
    "( [ dgs - sm ] ) .",

    "[ fig120 ] has a @xmath18 minimum of 20.58 instead of 20.75 .",

    "from the results and discussion in the previous section , it appears that : + ( i ) the sm by itself is strongly disfavored . either @xmath95 or @xmath83 should be nonzero .",

    "+ ( iii ) the hypothetical case where @xmath116 but @xmath84 is also disfavored to more than @xmath42 .",

    "non - mfv models like a fourth chiral generation , supersymmetry with r - parity violation , two - higgs doublet models , models with extra @xmath15 , etc .  can also contribute significantly to @xmath95 .",
    "the np models that can contribute significantly to @xmath83 , however , are rather rare .",
    "this is because the np contribution to the absorptive part needs light particles in the final state , and there are strong limits on the decays of @xmath10 to most of the possible light final state particles .",
    "one of the few exceptions is the mode @xmath117 , on which there is no available bound at this moment .",
    "thus , the np that contributes to @xmath83 has to do so via the interaction @xmath118 , but without affecting related decays like @xmath119 or @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved only in a limited subset of models , for example those with second and third generation scalar leptoquarks , r - parity violating supersymmetry @xcite , or extra @xmath15 bosons @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the former can provide enough contribution to @xmath83 to increase @xmath6 up to its current experimental upper bound @xcite .",
    "the amount of np required for this is consistent with the difference between the decay widths of @xmath40 and @xmath10 mesons ( @xmath121 @xcite ) , and the recent measurement of the branching ratio of @xmath122 , which is less than @xmath123 at 90% c.l .",

    "one should note here that if the d  results on the dimuon charge asymmetry survive the test of time , it will be a clear indication of the presence of a nonzero @xmath124 .",
    "such models are also favoured from the cdf and d  combined result on the allowed contours for @xmath7 and @xmath125 , but we need to wait for the final tevatron average .",
    "the analysis till now is valid only if we assume cpt - invariance .",

    "indeed for local field theories , cpt violation requires lorentz violation @xcite .",
    "( this need not be true for nonlocal field theories as well as for theories with noncommutative space - time geometry , see @xcite . ) in general , cpt violation should result in differences in masses and decay widths between particle - antiparticles pairs",
    ". however it may be easier to identify even through oscillation experiments , which typically are sensitive to an interference between the cpt - conserving and cpt - violating interactions .",
    "while cpt violation in the @xmath126 system is severely constrained through the mass difference between the neutral kaons @xcite , the bounds on the cpt violating parameters in the @xmath40 and @xmath10 systems are rather weak .",
    "in fact , the bounds for the @xmath40 sector are about three orders of magnitude weaker than those for the @xmath126 sector @xcite .",
    "the bounds on lorentz - violating parameters using the data on b mesons can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "here we use a model - independent parameterization , like the one earlier followed in @xcite and recently used by two of us @xcite , and determine the preferred parameter space using the data on @xmath2 oscillations . unlike @xcite , we take both @xmath48 and @xmath103 data into account .    one should note that as a new physics option , cpt violation is not exactly at the same footing as the models mentioned before . however in the language of the effective hamiltonian @xmath16 , the cpt violation manifests itself naturally through in a difference between the diagonal elements of @xmath16 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see if the constraints on the np coming from @xmath127 and @xmath114 can be relaxed at all with these additional degrees of freedom .",
    "a posteriori , we will justify the discussion on cpt violation by showing that if the new physics indeed turns out to be without an absorptive part , cpt violation might help to explain the @xmath2 mixing data , albeit only marginally .",

    ", the cpt violation can not affect the dimuon asymmetry , and it can make the fit to the @xmath2 mixing data only marginally better . in combination with a cpt conserving np , it can enhance the allowed parameter space for that np , however it does not seem to be able to obviate the need of an absorptive contribution from np .    the data on all the observables considered in this paper is still relatively preliminary , the deviations from the sm are only at about 2 - 3@xmath180 level , and future data may either confirm these deviations or expose them as statistical fluctuations . if the errors and uncertainties shrink keeping the central values more or less intact , this will mean :    * the sm is strongly disfavored . moreover , the relevant np should be flavor - dependent , as we do not see much deviation in the @xmath9 sector .",
    "* the np models that do not contribute to the absorptive amplitude of the @xmath2 mixing are also strongly disfavored if cpt is conserved .",
    "the best bets are those np models that provide both dispersive and absorptive amplitudes in the @xmath2 mixing .",

    "for example , one might find the branching ratio of @xmath38 enhanced significantly from its sm expectation .",
    "* without any cpt - conserving np , only cpt violation is only of marginal help , as it can not enhance the semileptonic asymmetry . even in combination with the cpt - conserving dispersive np",
    ", it can not allow regions in the parameter space to better than @xmath47 .    to summarize , the np models that contribute an absorptive part to @xmath2 mixing seem to be essential if one wants to explain the data on @xmath181 and @xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "there is only a limited set of such models , and they will be severely tested in near future . in the scenario that such an absorptive np contribution is ruled out ,",
    "one may have to resort to cpt violation in order to explain the data .",
