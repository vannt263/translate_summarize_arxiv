    "extragalactic background light ( ebl ) is the cumulative light emitted by any radiation process between the reionization era and the present epoch .",
    "sources include nucleosynthesis , emission from heated dust , and exotic particle decay .",
    "in particular , near - infrared ( ir ) ebl is thought to contain the redshifted ultraviolet radiation , which may have contributed to the reionization of the universe .",
    "therefore , near - ir ebl can serve as an indicator in investigations of galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe .    in the absolute measurement of near - ir ebl , foreground emissions , such as zodiacal light ( zl ) , integrated starlight ( isl ) , and",
    "diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) , must be removed from the sky brightness .",
    "previously , near - ir ebl has been investigated using data obtained from space telescopes , such as the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) aboard the cosmic background explorer ( _ cobe _ ) satellite ( e.g. , hauser et al .",
    "1998 ; gorjian et al .",
    "2000 ; cambrsy et al . 2001 ; levenson et al . 2007 ; levenson & wright 2008 ) , the infrared telescope in space ( _ irts _ ) ( matsumoto et al . 2005 ; matsumoto et al . 2015 ) , and _ akari _ ( tsumura et al .",
    "the literature has shown that particularly at 1@xmath10 , the residual intensity was @xmath115 times higher than the intensity of the integrated galaxy light ( igl ) derived from deep galaxy counts ( madau & pozzetti 2000 ; totani et al .",
    "in addition , sano et al . (",
    "2015 ) , hereafter paper i , reanalyzed the dirbe data and revealed that deviations of the residual emission from isotropy are less than 10% at @xmath8 and @xmath12 in the entire sky .",
    "another indirect estimation of ebl intensity has been derived by observation of the spectra of blazars emitting high - energy @xmath7-rays . since",
    "such @xmath7-rays are attenuated by interacting with ebl photons in the propagation of the intergalactic space , upper limits of ebl intensity can be derived by assuming the intrinsic spectra of blazars ( e.g. , guy et al . 2000 ; dwek & krennrich 2005 ; schroedter 2005 ; aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ; albert et al . 2008 ; mazin & raue 2007 ; orr et al . 2011 ; meyer et al .",
    "in addition , the recent result of the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) experiment has offered direct constraints on ebl , rather than estimated upper limits ( abramowski et al .",
    "most of the @xmath7-ray constraints on ebl at 1@xmath10 are a few to several times lower than the derived residual emissions , indicating that not all of the excess brightness originates from extragalactic sources .",
    "several studies have estimated the contributions of exotic extragalactic sources other than igl to ebl , including population iii ( pop - iii ) stars ( e.g. , inoue et al .",
    "2013 ; fernandez et al .",
    "2013 ) , intrahalo light ( ihl ) ( cooray et al . 2012 ; zemcov et al .",
    "2014 ) , direct collapse black holes ( yue et al . 2013 ) , and dark stars ( maurer et al .",
    "as suggested by paper i , the total contribution of all of these sources can not account for the observed excesses at @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "this fact also supports the idea that a portion of the excess emission may originate from the local universe : the milky way and/or the solar system .    at around @xmath4 ,",
    "the previously derived residual emissions are smaller than those at 1@xmath10 , approaching igl and @xmath7-ray upper limits ( gorjian et al .",
    "2000 ; wright & reese 2000 ; levenson et al . 2007 ; levenson & wright 2008 ) .",
    "since the zl contribution is much more dominant in wavelengths longer than @xmath13 , residual intensity has only been derived as upper limits ( hauser et al .",
    "1998 ; tsumura et al .",
    "2013c ) , consistent with the derived igl level ( fazio et al . 2004 ) .",
    "dgl , one of the foregrounds of optical to near - ir ebl , is thought to consist of starlight scattered by interstellar dust grains and thermal emission from the grains heated by this starlight .",
    "dgl can be used to measure the properties of the interstellar environment , including the intensity of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , the size distribution of the dust grains , and the mass ratio of the total grains to the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "in the current interstellar dust models ( e.g. , li & draine 2001 ; draine & li 2007 ; compigne et al .",
    "2011 ) , interstellar dust is assumed to be a mixture of silicate and graphitic grains , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) .    at optical wavelengths",
    ", dgl has been quantitatively investigated as a component that linearly correlates with diffuse interstellar @xmath14 emission ( e.g. , matsuoka et al .",
    "2011 ; brandt & draine 2012 ; ienaka et al .",
    "in contrast , the dgl in the near - ir has been difficult to measure because the optical depth is too low to enhance the dgl emission ( leinert et al .",
    "it was only recently that an analysis of the data obtained by the cosmic infrared background experiment ( ciber ) ( arai et al .",
    "2015 ) and dirbe ( paper i ) found the dgl component in high galactic latitudes at 1@xmath10 .    in the previous analysis of the dirbe data , arendt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used only a faint source model based on wainscoat et al.s ( 1992 ) star - counts model for the isl evaluation and did not find the dgl components at @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast , paper i reanalyzed the dirbe data with an improved isl evaluation using the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog ( psc ) data ( cutri et al .",
    "2003 ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) and found the high - latitude dgl component at @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that precise isl evaluation is required for the dgl measurement because the brightnesses of both components are expressed as similar functions of the galactic latitude in principle . combining the results with those in the optical wavelengths ( matsuoka et al .",
    "2011 ; ienaka et al .",
    "2013 ) , arai et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and paper i reported a bluer dgl spectrum from the optical to @xmath15 wavelengths , which is close to the expected scattered spectrum of an interstellar dust model in which the smaller dust grains are dominant .",
    "typical intensities of the high - latitude dgl at these bands were found to be less than 10% of that of the residual emission ( paper i ) .    in the longer near - ir wavelengths ,",
    "arendt et al . ( 1998 ) derived the dgl results at @xmath0 and @xmath16 from the dirbe data only at low - galactic ( @xmath17 ) and high - ecliptic latitudes ( @xmath18 ) to enhance the dust emission and avoid strong zl emission .",
    "because of its low precision in the isl evaluation , their results were derived not by direct correlation against diffuse @xmath14 emission but by the color - color method , which makes use of the color difference between isl and dgl .",
    "more importantly , they assumed that the dgl results in the low galactic latitudes , including the region close to the galactic plane , are the same as those in the high - latitude region of greater interest for dgl and ebl measurements .",
    "naturally , it is questionable whether the dgl results at low latitudes are applicable at high latitudes because dust properties , such as size distribution and composition of the grains , could be different between these regions .",
    "thereafter , the obtained dgl results have been used for the high - latitudes dgl contribution to the ebl measurements ( dwek & arendt 1998 ; gorjian et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "interstellar dust grains heated by the isrf for the solar neighborhood , which is estimated by mathis et al . ( 1983 ) , are expected to radiate thermal emission at the @xmath0 and @xmath16 wavelength range ( e.g. , dwek et al .",
    "1997 ; li & draine 2001 ; draine & li 2007 ; compigne et al .",
    "in contrast , tsumura et al . ( 2013b ) and matsumoto et al .",
    "( 2015 ) recently reported no detection of dgl at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath19 ) in their analysis of the diffuse sky spectrum obtained with _",
    "akari _ and _ irts _ , because of the low signal - to - noise ratio in their analyses of limited regions of the sky . if the isl estimation is improved from the previous dirbe analysis ( arendt et al .",
    "1998 ) , we expect dirbe to be the most appropriate data to confirm the high - latitude dgl component since they provide us with all - sky maps of higher signal - to - noise ratio .      as described in paper i , it is beneficial to use a combination of all - sky maps obtained from dirbe and the deep point source catalog ( 2mass psc ) for isl evaluation , in order to analyze the diffuse sky emission components at @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "to apply this strategy to the dirbe data in the @xmath0 and @xmath16 bands , we use the allwise source catalog based on the wide - field infrared survey explorer mission ( wise ; wright et al .",
    "the allwise source catalog provides accurate photometries and positions of over 747 million objects in the @xmath20 ( w1 ) , @xmath21 ( w2 ) , @xmath22 ( w3 ) , and @xmath23 ( w4 ) bandpasses . in the w1 and w2 bands ,",
    "the allwise achieved @xmath24 sensitivities of @xmath25 and @xmath26mag in the vega magnitude , respectively .",
    "these are comparable to those of the 2mass psc  15.8 and @xmath27mag in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 bands , respectively .",
    "since no star - count catalog has been available at @xmath30 , previous studies have used the @xmath12 dirbe or 2mass data to estimate the isl contribution at @xmath30 ( dwek & arendt 1998 ; wright & reese 2000 ; levenson et al .",
    "in contrast , the present study directly derives the isl intensity at @xmath0 and @xmath16 using the allwise source catalog .",
    "using the dirbe data , the present study mainly describes reanalysis of dgl and the residual emission components at @xmath0 and @xmath16 at high galactic latitudes . as our results",
    ", we first found a direct linear correlation between the diffuse near - ir and interstellar @xmath31 emission at high latitudes ( @xmath3 ) , which allows us to compare our results with those predicted by dust models in the high - latitude region . at @xmath30 ,",
    "the intensity of the residual emission was the same level as in the other studies within the uncertainty , marginally consistent with the igl level and @xmath7-ray constraints on ebl .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we provide an overview of the dirbe data used in this paper and describe the analysis , including the decomposition of each diffuse emission . in section 3",
    ", we present the results of each emission component at @xmath0 and @xmath16 in the high - latitude region .",
    "we compare the dgl results with the predictions of interstellar dust models composed of silicate and carbonaceous grains including pahs .",
    "we also compare the derived residual emission components with other studies .",
    "a summary of this paper appears in section 4 .    in this paper ,",
    "the intensities of the sky emissions are expressed in units of @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",

    "dirbe was one of the instruments onboard the _ cobe _ spacecraft and was designed to investigate the near to far - ir ebl .",
    "its cryogenic operation was implemented from 1989 november 24 to 1990",
    "september 21 . during these 10 months , almost the entire sky was observed in 10 photometric bands with effective wavelengths of @xmath8 , @xmath35 , @xmath0 , @xmath36 , @xmath22 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the dirbe instrument was designed to conduct accurate absolute measurements of the sky brightness , with a stray light rejection of less than @xmath42 ( magner 1987 ) and an absolute gain calibration uncertainty of @xmath43 and @xmath44 at @xmath0 and @xmath16 , respectively ( hauser et al .",
    "1998 ) . consequently",
    ", the all - sky maps at ir wavelengths were created with a beam size of @xmath45 .",
    "dirbe observed every line of sight of the sky with a solar elongation angle @xmath46 of @xmath47 once every 6 months ; once or twice during the 10-month observation . from the @xmath48 maps , the sky brightness at each pixel",
    "can be obtained by interpolating the observations made at various times at @xmath49 close to @xmath47 .",
    "as described in subsection 2.2.1 , the present analysis includes the evaluation of the scaling factor of the dirbe zl model ( kelsall et al .",
    "1998 ; hereafter the `` kelsall model '' ) against the dirbe data themselves .",
    "we then use the @xmath48 maps from which the zl contribution is not subtracted .",
    "the @xmath48 maps provide both the sky coordinates and the observation date for each pixel , which are necessary for running the code of the kelsall model .",
    "in contrast , zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma ) maps used in the previous studies ( arendt et al . 1998 ; cambrsy et al . 2001 )",
    "provided only the sky coordinates .",
    "the kelsall model therefore can not be used in the analysis of the zsma maps . for this reason",
    ", we use the @xmath48 maps created by 6 month observations , starting from 1990 january 1 .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( a ) of figure 1 depict the @xmath50 maps at @xmath0 and @xmath16 , respectively , on a mollweide projection that is reprojected from the original `` _ cobe _ quadrilateralized spherical cube '' ( csc ) projection adopted in dirbe products .",
    "the csc projection is an approximately equal - area projection of the celestial sphere onto an inscribed cube .",
    "each cube face is divided into @xmath51 pixels ; thus , all - sky maps have @xmath52 pixels , whose scales are approximately @xmath53 .",
    "the following analysis is performed on the csc projection maps .",

    "the intensity of the dirbe @xmath48 map , @xmath54 , is modeled as @xmath55 , where the subscript `` @xmath56 '' refers to one of the two bands ( @xmath0 or @xmath16 ) .",
    "the sky brightness is assumed to be a linear combination of four emission components , i.e. , the zl , dgl , isl , and residual emissions including ebl . the @xmath57 is therefore described as @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 indicate the intensities of the zl , dgl , isl , and residual emission , respectively .",
    "these four components are modeled as described below .",
    "the zl term @xmath63 is defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a free parameter and @xmath66 is the zl intensity estimated by the kelsall model with a default set of parameters ( kelsall et al .",
    "the kelsall model is a parameterized physical model of interplanetary dust emission fitted to the seasonal variation in the sky brightness observed by dirbe . to evaluate the typical scaling factor of the kelsall model against the dirbe data , we introduce the free parameter @xmath65 . if the kelsall model completely reproduces the seasonal variation observed by dirbe , the parameter @xmath65 is determined to be 1.0 .",
    "diffuse @xmath2 emission from interstellar dust has been suggested as a physically appropriate tracer of dgl ( brandt & draine 2012 ) .",
    "in fact , several studies have reported a good linear correlation between the intensities of diffuse optical to near - ir light and @xmath2 emission ( e.g. , matsuoka et al . 2011 ; ienaka et al . 2013 ; arai et al . 2015 ; paper i ) . in their analysis of the translucent cloud mbm32 in the optical wavelengths , ienaka et al .",
    "( 2013 ) suggested that the linear correlation may break in the optically thick region where dgl itself suffers extinction by interstellar dust .",
    "in contrast , at 1@xmath67 , arai et al . ( 2015 ) and paper i reported a linear correlation in the wide range of the @xmath2 emission intensity , @xmath68@xmath69 , because optically thin fields are dominant in the high galactic latitudes in the near - ir bands .",
    "we therefore expect the diffuse sky brightness at @xmath0 and @xmath1 to show linear correlation against diffuse @xmath2 emission .    in the present analysis ,",
    "we use the diffuse @xmath2 emission map created by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , hereafter referred to as the `` sfd map '' .",

    "the different pixel scales between the sfd map ( @xmath70 ) and the @xmath50 dirbe maps ( @xmath71 ) cause photometric bias in the correlation analysis .",
    "we therefore apply an @xmath72 pixel binning to the sfd map to obtain the same spatial resolution as that of the dirbe @xmath50 maps .",
    "the dgl term @xmath73 is then defined as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a free parameter and @xmath76 is the interstellar @xmath2 emission intensity , defined as @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the diffuse @xmath2 emission intensity of the binned sfd map .",

    "( 2000 ) derived the @xmath2 ebl intensity of @xmath79 .",

    "( 2011 ) showed the intensity relation of the sfd map and the diffuse optical light observed by _",
    "pioneer 10/11 _ , and found a correlation break below @xmath80 on the sfd map .",
    "based on these results , we assume the isotropic ebl at @xmath2 to be @xmath81 , and subtract this from the intensity of the sfd map to obtain the @xmath2 intensity associated with interstellar dust .      to estimate the isl contribution in the @xmath50 maps , we use the allwise source catalog created by the wise mission ( wright et al .",
    "2010 ) because the w1 ( @xmath82 ) and w2 ( @xmath83 ) bands are close to the dirbe bands that interest us .",

    "the intensity of the dirbe @xmath48 map is derived as the average of dozens of observations .",
    "therefore , we should use an averaged beam of the daily map created in the manner described in section 3.1.3 and figure 2 of paper i. the shape of the averaged beam at @xmath0 and @xmath16 is similar to that at @xmath8 and @xmath12 , with a full width at half maximum of @xmath84 .    because the spectral response function of wise is different from that of dirbe",

    "a vast majority of the galactic sources exhibit the rayleigh - jeans spectrum ; @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the flux density per unit frequency .",
    "then , the conversion formula between the weighted - mean flux density in the wise band ( @xmath87 ) and that in the dirbe band ( @xmath88 ) is described as @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the spectral response functions of dirbe and wise in the @xmath93 band , respectively , taken from the cobe / dirbe explanatory supplement ( 1998 ) and wright et al .",
    "equation ( 7 ) adopts the formula of flux density at the isophotal wavelength , which was defined in tokunaga & vacca ( 2005 ) .",

    "kelsall et al . (",
    "1998 ) pointed out that the intensity differences between the different zl models are largest in the ngp region .",

    "the residual emission is relatively constant at @xmath149 , but is systematically larger toward the lower - ecliptic latitudes at @xmath151 ( panels ( b ) and ( b ) of figure 6 ) .",
    "this indicates the difficulty of modeling of zl at @xmath151 , where the zl intensity is much stronger than that at @xmath149 .",
    "in addition to the high intensity of the zl at @xmath151 , the incompleteness of the zl model in the band may contribute to the large scatter of the other components  dgl , isl , and the residual emission ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "in this situation , there seems to be room for improvement on the zl model , though it is generally difficult .    though the residual emissions show some amount of scatter as functions of @xmath196 and @xmath197 , they are within the typical scatter derived by the regional variation in the parameters @xmath190 ( see table 1 and subsection 3.1 ) , because such regional variation naturally includes the dependence of @xmath196 and @xmath197 . such scatter as functions of @xmath196 and @xmath197 is also comparable to the estimated systematic uncertainty of the kelsall model ( table 1 ) . for the isotropy measurement of the residual emissions ,",
    "we therefore use the `` scatter '' value ( table 1 ) as the conservative values . in our analysis ,",
    "the deviation of the residual emission from the isotropy is then less than @xmath204 of the residual intensity at @xmath149 .",
    "this deviation from the isotropy is larger than that of @xmath205 at @xmath8 and @xmath199 ( paper i ) , partly because the residual emission intensity at @xmath149 is more than two times smaller than those at @xmath8 and @xmath199 .",

    "<S> the derived residual emission of @xmath6 at @xmath4 is marginally consistent with the level of integrated galaxy light and the ebl constraints from the @xmath7-ray observations . </S>",
    "<S> the residual emission at @xmath1 is not significantly detected due to the large uncertainty in the zl subtraction , same as previous studies . </S>",
