    "the behavior of mesoscopic superconductors is different from the behavior of bulk samples . in mesoscopic superconductors",
    "surface effects@xcite are very important since the interaction of vortices with the surface currents is large.@xcite the magnetic properties strongly depend on the sample sizes and geometry.@xcite the most studied geometries are the the mesoscopic disk the mesoscopic slab@xcite and the mesoscopic square .",

    "one interesting characteristic of the magnetic properties of mesoscopic superconductors is the behavior of the dc magnetization curves . in a mesoscopic scale , the vortices that are inside the sample",
    "induce a reinforcement of the surface barrier at fields greater than the first penetration field @xmath12.@xcite these new barriers allow for the existence of metastable states of constant vorticity as a function of magnetic field .",
    "each metastable state becomes unstable at the @xmath13-th penetration field @xmath14 in which vortices enter the sample and the magnetization has a discontinuous jump .",
    "these jumps have been observed numerically @xcite and experimentally in mesoscopic al disks.@xcite    in the last years numerical simulations of the time dependent ginzburg landau ( tdgl ) equations have been an important tool in the study of the static and dynamic properties of superconductors .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we review the known results for the ac magnetic response of macroscopic superconductors , in order to later compare them with our results in mesoscopic samples .",
    "in particular , the two fluid model for the meissner state and the coffey and clem model for the mixed state are reviewed . in sec.iii",
    "we describe the tdgl equations used in the simulations . in sec.iv we present our numerical results for the ac magnetic response of mesoscopic square samples .",

    "these behavior , characterized by the presence of two dissipation maxima is also observed in the mixed state . at the same time , for increasing frequency @xmath26 changes from london screening to a perfect diamagnetic state at high frequency .",
    "this transition is due to a decrease of the ac penetration length . in sec.iv.b",
    "we study the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath27 and @xmath22 at a fixed frequency .",

    "here we use the phenomenological tdgl equation in its s - wave form .",

    "from the results of the previous section , it is clear now that the ac magnetic response of a mesoscopic superconductor is different from the macroscopic behavior and it can not be explained with the known models .",
    "an interesting result is the significant decrease of dissipation each time the number of vortices increases . to understand this effect",
    "we have analyzed in detail the time variation of the order parameter and the magnetization within the sample .     at different applied magnetic fields and for @xmath270 .",

    "each curve represents the amplitude of the order parameter along the @xmath296 direction , perpendicular to a face of the square sample , obtained at a given time . to simplify the analysis",
    "the cut was done just at the center of the face at @xmath297 ( which is the preferred point for vortex penetration in a square sample ) .",
    "the order parameter is obtained at different times within a single period of the ac magnetic field . in particular",
    ", we show the behavior of the order parameter just before and after the two first values of the penetration fields , @xmath298 and @xmath299 . at @xmath3",
    "the order parameter @xmath300 is equal to unity in the entire sample and the dissipation is small . in the meissner state but for @xmath301 , fig .",
    "9 ( a ) shows that the magnitude of the order parameter near the boundary , and at the center of the face , has large oscillations around a small value .",
    "( b ) shows the time evolution of order parameter just after the first vortex entrance event , @xmath302 .",
    "we see that the entrance of vortices increases the order parameter at the boundary , where now @xmath300 oscillates around a value much higher than before .",
    "one can also see that the positions of the vortices are fixed inside the sample and do not oscilllate in the presence of the ac signal .",
    "recently , in an extension of the idea of the bean livingston barrier to mesoscopic superconductos , we have shown that the vortex entrance produces a reinforcement of the surface barrier , due to the interaction between the vortices that are trying to enter the sample and the vortices already inside the sample.@xcite the presence of this interaction decreases the surface currents .",
    "thus , the main effect after the entrance of vortices inside a mesoscopic superconductor is that the meissner currents decrease and the order parameter increases at the boundary .",
    "therefore the normal state electrons decrease and then the dissipation decreases .    figs .",
    "9(c ) and 9(d ) show similar behavior for @xmath303 and @xmath304 . after increasing @xmath1 at a constant number of vortices , the order parameter at the boundary has decreased , as seen in fig .",
    "the decrease of the order parameter increases the dissipation as was observed before .",
    "if new vortices enter again into the sample , the order parameter increases at the boundary , see fig .",
    "9(d ) and therefore the dissipation decreases again .",
    "this process is repeated in the other penetration fields @xmath14 .",
    "on the contrary , the entrance of vortices in a large sample do not produce an appreciable change in the amplitude of the order parameter at the boundary before and after the penetration event , and therefore the dissipation shows a continuous behavior [ as seen in fig .",
    "6(c ) ] .    a careful analysis of the entire profile of the order parameter for",
    "magnetic fields below but near to @xmath12 suggest that the depletion of the order parameter near the boundary may be attributed to `` vortices '' that are about to enter into the sample .",
    "these `` nascent vortices '' are located outside of the sample but near the surface .",
    "even more , for higher values of @xmath305 ( beyond linear response ) we find that these `` nascent vortices '' oscillate near the surface ( _ i.e. _ that the profile of the depletion of @xmath300 near the surface oscillates with @xmath306 ) . according to this scenario ,",
    "the length scale @xmath227 observed in fig .",
    "3(b ) for low frequencies may correspond to a characteristic length scale for the nucleation of vortices from the boundary .",
    "( for large fields @xmath307 , the length @xmath227 could be related to the size of the vortex free region @xmath113 of macroscopic samples ) .",
    "years ago , walton and rosemblum@xcite suggested the idea of nascent vortices as a possible source of the high - frequency losses in superconductors .",
    "this idea had further support from the analytical work of kramer @xcite who found static solutions of the ginzburg - landau equations which corresponded to vortices nucleated near the sample .",
    "the nascent vortices can oscillate under an ac field .",
    "this source of dissipation is not generally taken into account in macroscopic samples because in this case is small compared with the dissipation due to the motion of vortices inside the sample .",
    "however in a mesoscopic superconductor , with a few vortices confined inside the sample , this source of dissipation can be a significative part of the dissipation observed , as we have found here .",
    "we have studied the response of mesoscopic superconductors to an ac magnetic field . in mesoscopic superconductors",
    "vortices are confined inside the sample by the surface barrier and their dynamics play a secondary role in the dissipation . when increasing @xmath1 , discontinuities in @xmath15 and @xmath17 appear at each vortex penetration event .",
    "the dissipation is maximum before the penetration of vortices due to the effect of `` nascent vortices '' , which lead to large oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter at the boundary .",
    "after the penetration of vortices , the normal currents decreases and therefore the dissipation decreases , leading to a sudden suppression of the ac losses induced by the vortex entrance .    a.d.h . acknowledges oscar ars and c. hart for useful comments and help and the centro latino - americano de fsica ( claf ) for financial support .",
