    "the announced detection of a galaxy in cma @xcite centred at galactic coordinates l = 240@xmath0 , b = -8@xmath0 and at a distance of around 8 kpc from the sun @xcite , has produced considerable excitement reaching well beyond the astrophysical community .",
    "independently of how fascinating the idea , the cma galaxy scenario can be used to address several important astrophysical questions : it is the closest galaxy detected so far , it can be used for a detailed study of the merging process . in having an orbit that is nearly co - planar with the galactic disc",
    ", it can contribute to build up the thick disc thus favouring models of galaxy accretion as the origin of this still poorly understood component .",
    "finally , it would bring the number of observed nearby low mass satellites of the milky way closer to that expected from cosmological simulations @xcite of galaxy assembly .",
    "if the presence of a galaxy so close to the sun offers these unique opportunities , it also requires a detailed knowledge of the structure of the milky way to disentangle and understand the complex interplay between both systems .",
    "unfortunately , little attention has been paid to the 3gq in the past and apart from the presence of the galactic warp , little is known about its structure . in particular , spiral structure has not been clearly mapped @xcite .",
    "apart from the ring and the overdensity , deep colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) have been considered to provide additional evidence supporting the reality of the cma galaxy . by comparing cmds with stellar evolution models ,",
    "studies have found the cma galaxy to be at distance of 8 kpc and to have an age of 4 - 10 gyr @xcite .",
    "although the cmds do not exhibit clear post main - sequence signatures expected for a 4 - 10 gyr population @xcite ( red clump or red giant branch , horizontal branch , rr - lyrae ) , a distinctive feature , popularised as the blue plume ( bp ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] ) has been taken as strong evidence for the existence of the cma galaxy @xcite .",
    "the bp has been modelled and interpreted as the last burst of star formation in that galaxy 1 - 2 gyr ago ( which , given that it is a 1 - 2 gyr population , should also have a red clump ) .",
    "this piece of evidence has been taken to be an unambiguous indicator of the reality of cma given that it does not correspond to any known galactic component .",
    "additionally , the narrowness of the bp , which is indicative of a small distance spread , has been taken as evidence for a compact , possibly bound system @xcite .",
    "the absence of a clear post main - sequence is ascribed to heavy contamination by the galactic field population .",
    "we have recently found @xcite that the bp is actually composed of a young population less than 100 myr old . except for the cluster sequence which is well detached from the rest of the stars , the cmd of the field around the open cluster ngc  2362 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] is identical to the one obtained in another study @xcite at l=240@xmath0 , b=-8@xmath0 , not far from ngc  2362 , and used as proof for the existence of the cma galaxy . in particular , the bps have the same position , shape and extension , but we find the bp in fig .  [ fig : phot ] to be much younger and farther away , at 10.8 kpc .",
    "the enormous discrepancy between our study and the others deserves a closer look .",
    "the photometric analysis presented in other studies were exclusively limited to cmds .",
    "it is well known that the determination of fundamental parameters - reddening , distance , age and metallicity - is affected by a number of degeneracies ( that are readily admitted by the authors ) when using a single cmd : different sets of solutions are equally acceptable within observational errors .",
    "those studies have relied on complex modelling of the observed cmds including the expected galactic field in that direction .",
    "trial and error changes to the galaxy s fundamental parameters , number of stars and star formation history are made until the synthetic and observed diagrams are considered to match .",
    "but even given the rigour of the modelling , the degeneracies persist",
    ". furthermore , the descriptions of the expected galactic field are also synthetic .",
    "because in these models the contributions from the halo , thick and thin discs do not reproduce the bp , it has been argued that the bp does not correspond to any known galactic component .",
    "these models do not include spiral arms in the region of the 3gq under analysis .",
    "our results are based on ubvri five band photometry which _ does _ allow the determination of unique solutions .",
    "the reason is that , apart from cmds , two - colour diagrams ( tcds ) , which are distance independent , are also used in the analysis .",
    "moreover , when tcds are built using u band data ( not used in the other studies ) , reddening and spectral types of early type stars can be uniquely derived .",
    "furthermore , metallicity does not affect the colours of these stars significantly .",
    "hence the only unknowns that remain in the cmd analysis are distance and age , which can also be uniquely derived provided that the photometry is deep enough so that a population sequence appears with a well defined morphology .",
    "briefly , multi - band photometry including u measurements provides direct determinations of reddening and spectral type whereas single cmd analysis does not .",
    "young open clusters have long been recognised as privileged spiral tracers @xcite .",
    "their distances can be better determined than those of individual stars and their youth keeps them close to the spiral arms where they were born . over the last 10 years",
    "we have collected observations resulting in a unique data set of stellar photometry in the fields of many open star clusters @xcite .",
    "a sample of 61 open clusters has been obtained with the goal of tracing the detailed structure of the galactic disk in the 3gq , which we present and discuss in this letter .",
    "the clusters basic parameters ( reddening , distance and age ) have been derived via zero age main sequence ( zams ) and isochrone fits to the cluster sequences in different photometric diagrams .",
    "this is a standard and solid method that has been used in open cluster studies for several decades .    from the 61 clusters in our sample ,",
    "25 were determined to be younger than 100 million years .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : pars ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyz ] which represents the third quadrant of the galactic plane seen from above .",
    "also plotted , are the bps detected in the backgrounds of several clusters .",
    "a strip about 1.5 kpc wide , extending from l=210@xmath1 to l=260@xmath1 , spanning distances between 6 and 11 kpc depending on the line of sight , can be seen at the position expected for the outer ( norma - cygnus ) arm .",
    "this strip is mainly composed of bp detections , but also contains a few clusters . on the x - z projection , the putative outer arm members remain close to the formal galactic plane ( b=0@xmath1 ) up to l=220@xmath1 where the spiral arm starts descending , reaching around 1 kpc below the plane at l=240 - 250@xmath1 .",
    "the bending of the arm is a clear signature of the galactic stellar warp .",
    "this new optical detection of the norma - cygnus arm , extending from l=210@xmath1 to l=260@xmath1 , confirms our previous interpretation of the bp as a spiral tracer and our optical detection of the outer arm based on fewer points @xcite .",
    "that the bp appears so tight in the cmds is then a natural consequence of the arm s limited depth along each line of sight and is not , in this case , a signature of a compact and possibly bound system as previously used as an argument in favour of the cma galaxy @xcite .",
    "the youth of the bp also explains why no 1 - 2 gyr red clump is evident at 8 kpc .",
    "[ fig : xyz ] also reveals the presence of a few other bps .",
    "these would also be considered a non - galactic population , but in this case they are much closer than the proposed distance to the cma galaxy .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,>,>,^,^,^ , > , < \" , ]     ): lighter tones are closer to the plane and darker tones are deeper below .",
    "the tone scale is linear and each tone corresponds to the average z in the cell . a clear picture of the galactic warp is easily seen .",
    "the two curves that cross the panel are model @xcite extrapolations of the outer and perseus arms and the solid straight line sketches the local arm .",
    "the position and extent of the canis major overdensity are indicated by a large ellipse .",
    "the dashed line is the line of sight mostly dominated by the local arm and the dotted lines mark the range where the contribution of the local arm appears to be significant .",
    "lower panel : x - z projection .",
    "the signature of the warp is again prominent .",
    "it is also readily visible how the the molecular clouds closely follow the stellar distribution . ]",
    "we now focus on the stellar groups marked with a lighter tone .",
    "these groups are distributed between l=190@xmath1 and l=270@xmath1 , but seem to form an elongated structure between l = 230@xmath1 and l = 250@xmath1 stretching toward the outer galaxy .",
    "we interpret this structure as the probable extension of the local ( orion ) arm in the third quadrant .",
    "it appears that the orion arm stretches outward reaching and crossing the perseus arm . despite the small number of objects , a few clusters at l@xmath2245@xmath1 , and one at l@xmath2185@xmath1 , appear to be tracing perseus , although less evidently at the intersection with the local arm .    to further assess this tentative picture ,",
    "we have plotted the distribution of co molecular clouds ( kindly provided by j. may and l. bronfman ahead of publication and also from their previous survey ; @xcite ) . only clouds more massive then 0.5@xmath310@xmath4m@xmath5 are shown .",
    "the remarkable coincidence of stars and clouds in the outer arm , already stressed by us @xcite , lends further support to the interpretation of this structure as being a spiral arm and not a tidal tail composed of an old population .",
    "the distribution of clouds shows how between l=180@xmath1 and l=210@xmath1 the arm becomes very distant from the sun , which is likely the reason why very distant young clusters have not been optically identified .",
    "a good correspondence between the stellar positions and the co clouds is again found for the region between the sun and the outer arm ( only data from the older survey is available here ) , although not as good as the one found with the newer co data in the outer arm . in particular ,",
    "the perseus arm is traced by concentrations of co clouds around l@xmath2220 , 235 and 260@xmath1 .",
    "the lower panel shows that the gas also follows the vertical trend found for the stars in the outer arm .",
    "it is interesting to note that a picture in some aspects not very different from the one we have just established has been suggested more than 25 years ago @xcite . in particular , that the local arm starts tangent to the carina - sagittarius arm in the first quadrant at @xmath6 , and then probably crosses the perseus arm at @xmath7 , although not as clearly as in this work ( likely due to the limited depth of the older photoelectric photometry ) .    with these results in mind , we can address the cma overdensity .",
    "although there is no consensus about the exact centre of the overdensity , it is generally accepted that it is around @xmath8 , @xmath9 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : xyz ] it is readily seen , both in the gas and in the clusters , that this is the approximate direction of the proposed extension of the orion arm into the 3gq .",
    "it is therefore quite probable that we should find an overdensity of stars along this line of sight .",
    "indeed , looking along the local arm right through the middle leads us to predict @xmath10 as the maximum density longitude .",
    "interestingly , the latest estimate of the centre using red clump stars @xcite is similarly at @xmath10 .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the angle comprised by most of the local arm extension roughly corresponds to the area claimed to contain the overdensity .",
    "we further notice that this area should be neither much smaller , due to the presence of the local arm , nor much larger , due to the presence of the co cloud complexes around @xmath10 and @xmath11 which will limit visibility and introduce a border effect on the observed overdensity . in this context",
    ", we find that the cma overdensity is not the core of a galaxy , but simply the result of looking along the extension of the local arm in the third quadrant .",
    "a previous alternative explanation for the overdensity has been proposed in which the overdensity is a signature of the galactic warp @xcite , although it does not fully explain the monoceros ring .",
    "this has induced a lively debate where the warp explanation has been partially rebated @xcite .",
    "but that counter attack , although favouring the cma galaxy , also pointed out that its kinematics was compatible with the velocities of a distant arm detected in the fourth quadrant @xcite .",
    "since this distant arm is quite likely the continuation of the norma arm according to model predictions @xcite , the kinematic result then further supports our picture .",
    "given the evidence we have presented here , our scenario is the only one that presently accounts for , and explains , all the observational results . as a final remark , we note that no ad - hoc new spiral arms had to be introduced .",
    "all the spiral features we evoke are simply previously unclear extensions of well known arms whose existence has been repeatedly established during the last few decades . in this context , the presence of spiral arms in a region of a spiral galaxy where they are are supposed to be , but have not been detected before , is a more natural explanation of the cma phenomena than a cannibalised galaxy in a nearly co - planar orbit , how exciting it might be .",
