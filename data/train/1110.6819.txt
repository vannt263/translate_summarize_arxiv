    "geometrical percolation transition has been a long studied subject @xcite .",
    "it is characterised by a set of universal critical exponents , which describe the fractal properties of the percolating medium at large scales and sufficiently close to the transition .",
    "the exponents only depend on the type of percolation model and on the spatial dimension .",
    "the occupancy of the sites or bonds of a percolating system is controlled by a parameter and at a critical value of that parameter the cluster sizes ( defined by the number of adjacent sites posessing a pre - defined common feature ) goes to infinity which we call percolation transition .",
    "this phenomenon has been extensively studied for the thermal excitation of the two dimensional ising model and in this case the system undergoes percolation transition @xcite at the same critical temperature as the magnetization @xcite . in case of ising model , the geometrical cluster is defined by the adjacent sites consisting of parallel spins .",
    "the transition point differs in case of higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the percolation exponents of the geometrical clusters are identical for the models belonging to the same universality class ( ising and z(3 ) symmetric models @xcite ) .",
    "recently the dynamical percolation transition has been studied for 2d ising model by applying pulsed magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents were different from that of the static percolation transition associated with the thermal transition of the ising model indicating a different universality class .",
    "the distinct crossing point of the binder cumulant of the order parameter for different system sizes at the transition point also characterizes the being of the dynamical pecolation transition in a different universality class .",
    "study of social dynamics has been very popular in recent times and to capture the basic idea of consensus formation concepts of statistical physics has been applied largely @xcite .",
    "a large number of models has been studied ( voter model @xcite , sznajd model @xcite etc ) so far . in some models opinions",
    "have been considered as a continuous variable @xcite .",
    "the spreading of an opinion through the society may be compared with the percolation problem in physics and has been studied for nonconsensus opinion model earlier @xcite and was found to belong to the same universality class as the invasion percolation . in this paper",
    "we have studied the percolation transition of geometrical clusters in a recently proposed opinion model called the lccc model @xcite in which individuals exchange opinions controlled by an influencing parameter and a conviction parameter , the values of which are equal .",
    "the opinion of an individual is taken uniformly between @xmath1 and @xmath2 which changes by binary interactions , where an individual stays with his own opinion upto a certain fraction @xmath3 and takes a random fraction of a part of another agent s opinion determined by the same parameter ( detailed discussion has been given in the next section ) . by monte carlo simulation",
    "it was found that below a critical value ( @xmath4 ) of the conviction parameter the average opinion value remains zero , whereas above the critical value the average opinion value becomes non - zero .",
    "some critical exponents characterising the transition in lccc model and some variants of the lccc model were studied numerically @xcite .",
    "a generalised version of this model was introduced by sen @xcite in which the influencing parameter and the conviction parameter were different .",
    "a discrete version of the lccc model has also been studied @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have investigated the percolation transition of the geometrical clusters of the lccc model assuming individuals are located on the sites of a square lattice .",
    "we have defined @xmath5 as a group of adjacent sites with opinion value equal to or above a preassigned threshold value ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the cluster sizes are controlled by the influencing parameter @xmath3 and for a fixed @xmath0 , at a critical value of the influencing parameter @xmath6 , the percolation transition occurs .",
    "we determine the critical exponents by finite size scaling analysis of the maximum cluster size .",
    "the value of the critical point decreases with decrease of @xmath0 and coincides with that for the transition point of @xmath7 ( at which the average opinion diverges ) as @xmath8 .",
    "but the critical exponents remain unaltered with change in @xmath0 and also differ with the exponents known for the previously known models indicating the square lattice lccc to belong to a separate university class .",
    "we have also investigated this percolation transition in case of generalised lccc model @xcite , where the conviction parameter ( @xmath3 ) is different from the influencing parameter ( @xmath9 ) and once again found that although the critical point shifts depending on the values of @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 , the critical exponents remain same .",
    "the paper has been organised in the following manner : in sec ii we give a brief description of both the lccc model and the generalised lccc model . in sec iii",
    "we present the description of clusters and measure the critical exponents for the square lattice lccc model . in section",
    "iv we measure the exponents for the generalised lccc model and finally in sec v we have some discussions regarding this transition and some conclusions .",
    "the origin of this model is a multi - agent statistical model of closed economy @xcite where @xmath10 agents exchange a fixed wealth through pair - wise interaction controlled by a  saving \" parameter .",
    "lallouache et .",
    "@xcite proposed a similar multiagent model to describe the dynamics of opinion formation .",
    "the basic difference in this model is that there is no constraint regarding the conservation of opinion .",
    "let there are @xmath10 agents and each agent @xmath11 begins with an individual opinion @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "they exchange opinions between each other by binary interactions as follows : @xmath13 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "o_j(t+1 ) & = & \\lambda[o_j(t ) + \\epsilon^\\prime o_i(t)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are drawn randomly from uniform distributions in @xmath16 $ ] . in this model",
    "the opinions are bounded i.e. , @xmath17 for all @xmath11 . here",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is interpreted as  conviction \" i.e. , the power to retain someones own opinion .",
    "the second term signifies the extent to which somebody get influenced by another . here",
    "both the conviction parameter and the influencing parameters are same and moreover they are identical for every individual . the opinion exchange for the generalised lccc model was as follows @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath3 is the conviction parameter and @xmath9 is the influencing parameter with @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the special case of @xmath19 is the lccc model .",
    "the order parameter is the average opinion @xmath20 .",
    "numerical simulations show that the system stabilises into two possible phases : for any @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath23 , while for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27 . in lccc model",
    "@xmath4 is the critical point . in case of the generalised model @xmath28 depends on the value of @xmath9 and the mean field phase boundary",
    "is given by @xmath29 .",
    "if we study these models on a square lattice , then also the critical points do not change .",
    "some critical exponents characterising the transition in lccc model and some variants of the lccc model were also studied numerically @xcite .",
    "in this section we will discuss about the percolation behaviour of the geometrical clusters formed on a square lattice lccc model .",
    "here we assume that the agents are placed on the sites of a square lattice and follow the lccc dynamics .",
    "we define a geometrical cluster as consisting of the adjacent sites having opinion value more than or equal to a prefixed threshold opinion value ( @xmath0 ) . in our numerical simulation",
    "we have used random sequential updating rule . for each value of @xmath3 and @xmath0 ,",
    "when the system reaches a steady state we measure the percolation order parameter @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the size of the largest cluster and @xmath32 is the linear size of the system ) . the value of @xmath33 increases with @xmath3 and at some @xmath6 the system undergoes a percolation transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fg1 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath6 decreases with decrease in @xmath0 , approaching the value @xmath28 as @xmath8 ( figs .",
    "[ comp ] and  [ crit ] )",
    ". moreover it is also evident from fig .",
    "[ comp ] that the finite size effect diminishes with decrease in @xmath0 .",
    "the percolation transition is characterised by power - law variation of different quantities .",
    "the order parameter which means the relative size ( @xmath33 ) of the largest cluster varies as @xmath34    and the correlation length diverges near the percolation transition point as @xmath35 where , @xmath6 is the critical conviction parameter .",
    "the values of the critical exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 specify the universality class of the transition .",
    "however , the exponents are not determined from these definitions due to finite size effects .",

    "if we plot @xmath40 against @xmath3 for different system sizes but fixed @xmath0 , then by tuning @xmath41 , all the curves can be made to cross at a single point .",
    "the value of @xmath3 for which this happens is the critical conviction parameter ( @xmath6 ) . to estimate @xmath37",
    ", @xmath40 is to be plotted against @xmath42 and by tuning @xmath43 , the curves are made to collapse , giving an accurate estimate of the exponent @xmath37 .",

    "we plot @xmath40 against @xmath3 ( fig .",

    "now to determine @xmath37 , we plot @xmath40 against @xmath42 and by tuning the value of @xmath43 all the three plots are made to collapse on a single curve ( inset of fig .",

[ clsize ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath64 remains same for other values of @xmath0 ( at corresponding critical values of @xmath3 ) .    for further verification of the critical point and the universality class ,",

    "the crossing point of the different curves ( @xmath68 ) for different system sizes gives the critical point ( @xmath48 ) for @xmath44 , which is in good agreement with the previous estimation from finite size scaling of the corresponding @xmath0 ( fig .",

    "this implies that the percolation transition is much more robust than the average opinion transition . the plots for the binder cumulant also satisfy the crossing point and the critical exponents as obtained previously ( figs .",
