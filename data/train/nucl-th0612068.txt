    "energy loss of a high transverse momentum parton travelling in the hot and dense medium created in ultrarelativistic collisions has been the subject in recent years of intense investigation , reviewed in @xcite . with the aim of being able in particular to assert the existence of the qgp phase of matter @xcite .",
    "it has become clear however , that an important issue is the influence of the medium evolution on the radiative energy loss , when following the bdmps @xcite - zakharov @xcite - wiedemann @xcite approach .",
    "the medium can not be described as being static @xcite  : longitudinal and transverse flow have to be considered @xcite .",
    "they may alter substantially the distribution of matter before freeze out .",
    "the crucial parameter for energy loss is the local transport coefficient @xmath1 , related to the squared average transverse momentum transfer  from the medium to the hard parton  per unit length .",
    "for an ideal qgp , and in a comoving coordinate system , one may relate locally @xmath2 with the energy density of the medium @xmath3  : @xmath4 with @xmath5 @xcite .    recently from various authors @xcite came the determination of @xmath6 from data , taking into account bjorken longitudinal expansion @xcite but neglecting transverse flow . in @xcite @xmath6 is found to be much larger than 2 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , leading to speculations about a strongly coupled qgp @xcite .",
    "a recent endeavour @xcite implementing a strong non - bjorken expansion including radial flow @xcite , with a small value of primordial transverse velocity @xmath9 has led to a `` moderately optimistic '' scenario reducing @xmath10 to @xmath11 compatible with perturbative estimates .    in the present note",
    ", we try to reformulate the problem .",
    "we show first how to determine @xmath12 in the presence of transverse flow by applying a proper lorentz boost .",
    "we assume a realistic ( ideal ) hydrodynamical description for heavy - ion collisions , based on longitudinal bjorken expansion @xcite and a radial flow with vanishing initial velocity .",
    "we are led to the conclusion that the transverse flow is a small effect and does not provide the solution to the perturbative / non - perturbative dilemma .",
    "the problem is to find the relationship between @xmath2 for a moving medium and @xmath13 ( medium at rest ) , locally in space and time .",
    "we focus on central collisions .",
    "we consider  in the transverse plane @xmath14 of a collision a medium moving with velocity @xmath15 along the @xmath16 axis towards a parton which enters into it at the origin of our coordinate system at time @xmath17 , at point @xmath18 , leaving it at point @xmath19 with @xmath20 where we denote by @xmath21 the time spent by the parton in the medium .",
    "the dimension of the medium in the velocity direction being @xmath22 , one finds [ 1e ] t = l v +  .",
    "the medium at rest has length @xmath23 defining @xmath24 such that @xmath25 .",
    "entering at point @xmath26 , the parton leaves the medium at rest , at point @xmath27 such that as a result of the lorentz boost , we find [ 2e ] b_0^ = t ( ch  ( 1 +  ) , ,  ch  ( +   th  ) , 0 )    with [ 3e ] a_0b_0 = l  ch  _ 0 t  ch  ( 1 +  th  )    the angle @xmath28 corresponds to the angle @xmath29 , but evaluated in the rest system of the medium , implying [ 4e ] _ 0 = th  + 1 +  th     and [ 5e ] _ 0 =   ( 1 +  th  )  .",
    "let us define in the rest frame the initial momentum of the parton  :    [ 6e ] p_0^ = p_0 ( 1 , _ 0 , _ 0 , 0 )  .",
    "after travelling on a small distance @xmath30  we want to extract a * local * information  and experiencing @xmath31-broadening and energy loss , the parton has a momentum @xmath32  : [ 7e ] _",
    "0^ = ( p_0 - _ 0 ) ( 1 , ( _ 0 + _ 0 ) _ 0 , ( _ 0 + _ 0 ) , ( _ 0 + _ 0 ) _ 0 )    where @xmath33 is the azimuthal angle in the @xmath34 plane . in the moving frame , the corresponding momenta are  : [ 8e ] & & p^ = p ( 1 , , , 0 ) + & & ^ = ( p - ) ( 1 , ( + ) , ( + ) , ( + ) )  .",
    "[ 9e ]    the momenta in both frames are related via a lorentz boost , which leaves the @xmath35 component unchanged , leading to [ 11e ] p = p_0 _ 0  .    on the other hand @xmath36 ,",
    "since the lorentz boost does not affect the projection on the @xmath34 plane . using eqs .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) and ( [ 5e ] ) , we also find  : [ 12e ] = _ 0 _ 0  .",
    "the corresponding transverse momentum broadening is easily obtained in both frames  : we sum the squares of the momentum increase in the @xmath37 axis direction and in the direction orthogonal to the parton momentum  : [ 13e ] p_0 ^ 2 = p_0z^2 + p^2_0 p_0 ^ 2  .",
    "similarly [ 14e ] p_^2 = p^2  .    using eqs .",
    "( [ 11e ] ) and ( [ 12e ] ) , we find that @xmath38 and may immediately infer the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath2  : indeed we get [ 15e ] p_^2 & = &   + p_0 ^ 2 & = & _ 0  _ 0 = _ 0  , [ 16e ]    leading to ( locally )  : [ 17e ] _",
    "0  ch  ( 1 +  th )  .",
    "recently this transformation property has been independently derived in @xcite , and already used in @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 may be parametrized as discussed in the introduction .",
    "writing the transverse flow velocity as @xmath39 and with the parton momentum written as @xmath40 , we get [ 18e ] = _ 0  u^ p^ p_0  .    a way to understand this relation is to write the transport coefficient as the rate of interaction  the number of interactions per unit time  multiplied by the typical invariant scale @xmath41 characterizing the momentum transfer to the parton in a parton - medium collision  : for a medium at rest @xmath42 and for a moving medium @xmath43 .",
    "the rate of interaction varies indeed like the inverse of the time spent in the medium  : [ 18ea ] r r_0 = ch  ( 1 +  th  )  ,    so that eq .",
    "( [ 17e ] ) is recovered .",
    "using @xmath44 we may now calculate the transverse broadening @xcite obtained when taking into account the transverse flow for a parton travelling in a thermalized medium at temperature @xmath45 .",
    "this last condition allowing us to determine the @xmath46 dependence of @xmath45 and the transverse velocity @xmath47 by using hydrodynamical model codes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : n0 ] we have schematized the situation in the transverse plane @xcite  : the vector @xmath48 defines the point in the plane where the hard parton enters the medium . the parton then follows a path along the unit vector @xmath49 and along its way , encounters the radial flow along the direction @xmath50 which depends on time @xmath46 .",
    "we write @xmath51 and defining @xmath29 ( according to the definition given in sect .  2 ) and @xmath52 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : n0 ] , we find that [ 19e ] = s -  .",
    "writing @xmath53 as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath47 depends on @xmath56 and @xmath46 .",
    "we may now get the following expression for the transverse broadening of the parton for a cylindrical medium at central rapidity  : [ 20e ] ( p_^2)_bj + flow & = & 1 r_a^2 _ 0^r_a sds _ 0 ^ 2 d__0^_max d  _ 0 ( t ( r , ) ) ( v ) ( 1 + v )    where @xmath57 is defined as the maximum in - medium path length compatible with geometry and taking into account the life - time of the thermalized medium @xmath58  : [ 21ea ] _ max =  min \\ { _ max^geom , _ qgp }  ,    with [ 21e ] _",
    "max^geom = s +  ,    and @xmath59 is the initial time . in the integral ( [ 20e ] ) the boundaries are simplified by neglecting the flow beyond the nucleus radius @xmath60 ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : n2 ] ) .",
    "the life - time @xmath58 is estimated in the framework of bjorken expansion @xcite , after having fixed the initial temperature and taking the final temperature as @xmath61  mev .",
    "( in the following we take @xmath62fm ) .",
    "we actually calculate the ratio [ 200e ] r_flow = ( p_^2)_bj + flow /(p_^2)_bj in order to quantify the importance of the radial flow in addition to bjorken ( @xmath63 ) longitudinal expansion @xcite , for which [ bje ] ( t ) = ( t_0 ) ( ) ^3 = ( _ 0 ) ( ) ^3c_s^2  , where @xmath64 denotes the sound velocity ( taken to be @xmath65 ) .    the calculation is done in the framework of ideal hydrodynamics , assuming initial conditions relevant for heavy - ion collisions , e.g. a vanishing flow velocity at initial time @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the result is shown as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1 ] for a cylindrical medium of radius @xmath66  fm ( @xmath67 nucleus ) , fixing the initial time @xmath68  fm , as a function of the initial temperature @xmath69 .",
    "the curves are actually calculated using the approximate analytic expressions derived in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the ratio @xmath70 the dependence on the initial temperature",
    "@xmath69 cancels . ignoring the limit given by @xmath58 results in the dotted curve .",
    "we note that @xmath70 is smaller than 1 .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : the flow has a non negligible effect for large enough values of @xmath56 , where @xmath47 differs significantly from 0 .",
    "but this is only realized ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : n0 ] ) when the jet is moving with the flow , since then @xmath71 , and therefore @xmath72 .",
    "this effect is even larger for the dotted curve .",
    "we note that the angular dependence of eq .",
    "( [ 17e ] ) , which is responsible for the reduction of broadening , and also quenching , is not present in the ansatz for @xmath2 given in @xcite and used in @xcite .    as an exercise we calculated @xmath70 with",
    "the following set - up : we assume that @xmath73 follows bjorken s @xmath46 dependence ( [ bje ] ) , keeping the hydro velocity @xmath74 in @xmath75 , but without the @xmath56-dependence in the temperature , and dropping the @xmath76 term .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 becomes larger than one , which can be seen from the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1 ] , because in this case the factor @xmath75 wins .",
    "two conclusions emerge  :    \\a ) the effect of the transverse flow is small and of the order @xmath77 .",
    "\\b ) the ratio @xmath78 is smaller than 1 which goes against the possibility that the transverse flow would allow us to solve the perturbative / non - perturbative dilemma discussed in the introduction .",
    "the smallness of the effect is due to the fact that the transverse velocity takes a long time to reach an appreciable value , starting from @xmath79 and can not provide the possibility of compensating the cooling effect .",
    "this can be visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2 ] where we have plotted the quantity @xmath80  which is essentially the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ 20e ] )  for different values of @xmath46 , as a function of @xmath56 , using ideal hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the effects due to a non - vanishing shear viscosity compared to the ideal hydrodynamical description for the quantity @xmath80 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : n3 ] . the details of this calculation may be found in @xcite .",
    "no significant effects due to the transverse flow in the presence of shear viscosity are found , as maybe expected , when comparing the solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : n3 ] , although cooling is slowed down at least for times @xmath46 presented in this figure : @xmath70 stays of @xmath81 .",
    "the medium - induced radiative jet energy loss is determined by the transport coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "while the energy loss formalism has been previously developed only for a medium without flow it is apparent from the discussion at the end of section 3.b that if one uses @xmath2 , as given in eq .",
    "( [ 17e ] ) , to determine the interaction of qcd partons with the medium then there is no modification of the fundamental energy loss formulas . thus eqs .",
    "( 25 ) and ( 26 ) of @xcite remain valid in the presence of flow .",
    "the basic quantity is the radiation spectrum of gluons emitted from the high energy parton . in the soft gluon energy limit",
    ", @xmath82 much smaller than the parton energy , the dominant mechanism consists in multiple scatterings of the radiated gluon off the `` centers '' describing the medium @xcite . for static centers , as well as for a dense ( thermal ) medium which undergoes longitudinal bjorken - type expansion @xcite the gluon spectrum obeys the following scaling law in terms of a characteristic gluon energy @xmath83 @xcite ,              however , when transverse flow is present in the medium this nice scaling property does not hold , since @xmath12 appears at different times , corresponding to the interference product of the emission amplitude and the complex conjugate one ( see eg .",
    "( 25 ) in @xcite ) . as for the case of @xmath85-broadening",
    ", we do not expect large effects due to transverse flow .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we calculate the ratio        as we expect from fig .",
    "[ fig : n1 ] the ratio @xmath87 does not differ significantly from @xmath88 , when calculated within ( ideal ) hydrodynamics and realistic initial conditions for the flow field @xmath89 : a typical value is @xmath90 for @xmath91 . from this estimate",
    ", we expect small effects of radial flow on the quenching of large transverse momentum hadrons produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "this conclusion on @xmath92 is confirmed in the recent analysis in @xcite using eq .",
    "( [ 17e ] ) .",
    "our study seems to rule out the possibility of reducing the large value of @xmath2 from model comparisons with data @xcite by including radial flow with initial conditions , which we assume to be realistic and causal in heavy - ion collisions .",
