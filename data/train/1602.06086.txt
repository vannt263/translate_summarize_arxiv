    "understanding the mechanism underlying quark confinement from the first principle of qcd is still a challenging problem in theoretical particle physics @xcite . as a possible step towards this goal",
    ", it will be efficient to extract the dominant field mode @xmath2 responsible for confinement from the yang - mills field @xmath3 to clarify the physics behind the phenomena of confinement .",
    "the well - known mathematical identity called the cartan decomposition @xcite is used to decompose the field variable @xmath3 valued in the lie algebra @xmath4 of a gauge group @xmath5 into the simultaneously diagonalizable part in the cartan subalgebra @xmath6 and the remaining off - diagonal part in the orthogonal complement of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the cartan decomposition is not suited for studying the non - perturbative features of the gauge field theory with local gauge invariance , since the cartan decomposition can not retain the original form after the gauge transformation , namely , the local rotation of the cartan - weyl basis for the lie algebra .    in view of these , the novel decomposition called the cho - duan - ge - faddeev - niemi ( cdgfn ) decomposition @xcite is quite attractive , since the cdgfn decomposition given in the form @xmath8 is gauge covariant , namely , it keeps its form under the gauge transformation or the local color rotation . in the cdgfn decomposition",
    ", the unit lie algebra valued field @xmath9 called the color direction field or the color field for short plays the crucial role for retaining the local gauge covariance of the decomposition . for @xmath10 , the color field @xmath11",
    "is constructed from the maximally commuting generators @xmath12 @xmath13 in the cartan subalgebra @xmath6 according to the local adjoint rotation by a group element @xmath14 of the gauge group @xmath5 at every point @xmath15 of spacetime : @xmath16 the color direction field belongs to the subset of @xmath17 which is topologically equivalent to @xmath18 , where a subgroup @xmath19 called the maximal stability subgroup of @xmath5 is specified from the degeneracy among the eigenvalues of a representation matrix of @xmath12 .",
    "in other words , the color field @xmath9 is regarded as the local embedding of the cartan direction @xmath12 in the internal space of the non - abelian group @xmath5 . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the cartan decomposition is identified with a global limit of the cdgfn decomposition , which urges us to consider that the abelian projection method @xcite is nothing but a gauge - fixed version of the gauge - covariant cdgfn decomposition .",
    "the application of the novel decomposition to the yang - mills non - abelian gauge field paves the way for understanding quark confinement in a gauge - independent manner .",
    "in fact , this method has been extensively used to investigate quark confinement in the @xmath1 yang - mills theory in the last decade , see e.g. , @xcite for a review .    a promising mechanism for understanding quark confinement is well known as the dual superconductivity @xcite .",
    "it is a hypothesis based on the electro - magnetic dual analog of the type ii superconductor in which the magnetic field applied to the bulk of the superconductor is squeezed to form the magnetic vortex due to the meissner effect of excluding the magnetic field from the superconductor @xcite .",
    "the color electric field created by a pair of a quark and an antiquark would be squeezed to form an electric flux - tube or a hadron string with its ends on a quark and an antiquark .",
    "for the dual superconductivity to work , therefore , one needs magnetic objects , say magnetic monopoles to be condensed in the vacuum of the yang - mills theory , which is supposed to be dual to the ordinary superconductivity caused by condensation of electric objects , a pair of electrons called the cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the magnetic monopole in the pure yang - mills theory has been mostly constructed by the abelian projection method , which @xcite breaks explicitly the original non - abelian gauge group @xmath5 to the maximal torus subgroup @xmath20 . however , this is not the only way to define magnetic monopoles in pure yang - mills theory without the higgs field .",
    "in fact , one can define gauge - invariant magnetic monopoles in the pure yang - mills theory without breaking the original gauge symmetry by using the non - abelian stokes theorem @xcite for the wilson loop operator which is in itself gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "the gauge - invariant magnetic monopole is specified by the maximal stability subgroup @xmath21 which is uniquely determined for the highest - weight state of a given representation for a quark source . for quarks in the fundamental representation of @xmath1 , especially , the maximal stability subgroup @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , which is distinct from the maximal torus group @xmath23 for @xmath24 .    the contribution of magnetic monopoles to the wilson loop average can be calculated by using the path - integral framework using the reformulation of the yang - mills theory based on change of variables in accord with the field decomposition .",
    "we find that there are some options for reformulating the @xmath1 yang - mills theory ( @xmath24 ) corresponding to the different choice of the color direction field compatible with the maximal stability group , although there is only one way to reformulate the @xmath25 yang - mills theory .",
    "whichever options we use , we need the field decomposition formula , which allows us to decompose an arbitrary element @xmath26 of a lie algebra @xmath27 to the part @xmath28 in the lie algebra of @xmath19 and the remaining part @xmath29 .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite and also @xcite for a review .",
    "another popular object of topological nature which is believed to be responsible for confinement is the center vortex @xcite , which is associated to the center subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the confinement / deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature in the @xmath1 yang - mills theory is associated with the restoration / spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry @xmath30 , which is signaled by vanishing / nonvanishing of the polyakov loop average .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite for reviews .",
    "we suppose , however , that magnetic monopoles and magnetic vortices can not be independent topological objects .",
    "they could be different views of a single physical object , just like two sides of a coin , to be simultaneously defined in a self - consistent way @xcite .",
    "however , this statement remains still a conjecture to be proved .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the gauge - covariant field decomposition of the yang - mills field and the non - abelian stokes theorem for the wilson loop operator developed so far for @xmath1 to the exceptional group @xmath0 , which is a preliminary step toward reformulating the @xmath0 yang - mills theory @xcite to discuss the mechanism for confinement / deconfinement .",
    "our interests of the exceptional group @xmath0 lie in a fact that the @xmath0 yang - mills theory has the linear potential @xcite and that the center vortex confinement mechanism is argued to work for @xmath0 in @xcite , although @xmath0 has a trivial center subgroup , consisting only of the identity element @xcite .",
    "we want to define the gauge - invariant magnetic monopole in the @xmath0 yang - mills theory and then examine whether the magnetic monopole defined in our framework can be a universal topological object responsible for confinement , irrespective of the gauge group .",
    "this investigation will help us to prove or disprove the above conjecture on the interrelation between magnetic monopoles and magnetic vortices .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first determine the maximal stability subgroup for a given representation of @xmath0 , after presenting some basic properties of @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "iii , we subsequently derive the gauge - covariant decomposition formula for the @xmath0 yang - mills field corresponding to each maximal stability subgroup .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 yang - mills field has different gauge - covariant decompositions depending on the maximal stability subgroup , which are more complicated than those obtained for the @xmath1 yang - mills field .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the decomposition formula for @xmath0 can not be obtained as a simple extension of that for @xmath1 .",
    "this is because the fact that all roots of @xmath1 have the same norm was used in deriving the decomposition formula for @xmath1 .",
    "however , some roots of @xmath0 have different norm from the other roots .",
    "consequently , the relevant decomposition for @xmath0 can not be obtained by using the double commutators , in sharp contrast to @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , the multiple commutators with the cartan generators enable us to obtain the desired decomposition .",
    "remarkably , we have found that the decomposition formula for @xmath0 can be obtained using sextuple commutators with the cartan generators or the color fields .",
    "moreover , the method presented in this paper for obtaining the decomposition formula for @xmath0 can be applied to any semi - simple lie algebra , and therefore the reformulation of the yang - mills theory would be possible for an arbitrary semi - simple gauge group . in sec .",
    "iv , we derive a non - abelian stokes theorem for the wilson loop operator of the @xmath0 yang - mills field , which is written using the sextuple commutators with the color direction fields , as an application of the decomposition formula .",
    "this enables us to define gauge - invariant magnetic monopoles in the @xmath0 yang - mills theory in sec .",
    "v. we find that which kind of magnetic monopoles can be defined is determined by the stability subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "we show that the magnetic charge derived from the gauge - invariant magnetic monopole is subject to a novel quantization condition , which is similar to , but different from the quantization condition for the dirac magnetic monopole and thooft - polyakov magnetic monopole .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "some technical derivations are collected in appendices a , b and c.",
    "in this section , we give some basic properties of an exceptional group g(2 ) .",
    "we begin with the dynkin diagram of @xmath0 given by fig .  [",
