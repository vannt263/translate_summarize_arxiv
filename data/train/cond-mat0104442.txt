    "the discovery of quasicrystals in 1984 @xcite has attracted a great amount of experimental and theoretical attention to quasiperiodic systems@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a 1d quasiperiodic array of electric barriers is characterized by its self - similar energy spectrum and critical ( neither extended nor localized ) states .",
    "recent advances in semiconductor and nano - technologies have permitted the realization of a uniform magnetic field at nanometer scales , by creating magnetic dots or depositing ferromagnetic or superconducting material patterns on heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum and transport properties of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) modulated by a regular array of nanoscale magnetic field inhomogeneities have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss electron motion in a 2deg subject to the field of a nearby quasiperiodic array of parallel magnetic stripes .",
    "this case differs from electric or dielectric modulation in that 2deg electron tunneling through magnetic barriers is inherently a two - dimensional process @xcite .",
    "the effective potential experienced by the electron is dependent on the wave vector perpendicular to the tunneling direction .",
    "as we show below , since for a quasiperiodic magnetic pattern this potential is still quasiperiodic for any given transverse wavevector , both the transmission and conductance display quasiperiodic properties .",
    "our main finding , however , is that the presence of extended states somewhere in the spectrum produces a residual conductivity at infinite length , which is lost as the incident energy decreases , much in the manner of a metal - insulator transition .",
    "we consider a @xmath0 under an inhomogeneous perpendicular magnetic field produced by two types of magnetic blocks @xmath1 and @xmath2 arranged in a fibonacci sequence ( fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be uniform along the @xmath3 direction and to vary along the @xmath4 direction . throughout this work we use the landau gauge @xmath5 .",
    "for magnetic block @xmath6 of width @xmath7 , we assume for simplicity a magnetic profile @xmath8 $ ] ( fig . 1 ( b ) ) .",
    "its corresponding vector potential can be chosen as @xmath9 $ ] ( fig . 1 ( c ) ) , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the heaviside step function . by introducing in addition the cyclotron frequency @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the effective mass of electrons ) , all quantities below are transformed into dimensionless units . for @xmath14 and an estimated @xmath15 , then @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . writing the wavefunction in the form @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the wavenumber associated with the spatial degree of freedom in the direction of the stripes ) , one obtains the following @xmath21 schrdinger equation governing the motion of @xmath0 electrons in the presence of the magnetic modulation , @xmath22\\ } \\psi ( x)=2(q^2/2-e)\\psi(x).\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is an oscillating function arising from the fibonacci sequence @xmath24 constructed from the vector potentials @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27/2 $ ] can be considered as an effective q - dependent potential for motion along the tunneling direction .",
    "the dependence on @xmath20 of the quantity @xmath28 implies that this problem is inherently two dimensional . here and",
    "in what follows , we assume @xmath29 .",
    "then , in the units chosen , the function @xmath23 is a sequence of barriers of height @xmath30 . for a given @xmath20 , electron tunneling through the magnetic structure will be equivalent to electron motion in a @xmath21 fibonacci electric potential with square barriers ( @xmath31 ) , square barriers and wells ( @xmath32 ) , or square wells ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "matching wave functions at the edges of the magnetic block @xmath2 yields the following transfer matrix @xmath34 for an electron propagating through such block , @xmath35e^{-i k_0 l_q } & -i \\mu^-_q \\sin(k_q",

    "then @xmath46 @xmath47 , with initial condition @xmath48 , @xmath49 , which yields a trace map @xmath50 and a constant of motion @xmath51 @xcite , where @xmath52 . the constant of motion",
    "@xmath53 characterizes the extent of quasiperiodicity of the fibonacci system .",
    "now we consider a simple case , i.e. , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , which is likely to be the easiest to realize experimentally .",
    "then one has @xmath56 and the constant of motion @xmath57/2kk_0\\}^2.\\ ] ] for the case @xmath58 , @xmath59 , which corresponds to a purely periodic magnetic superlattice . according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath53 is also dependent on the normal wavevector @xmath20 through @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is in general positive definite for most incident energies @xmath62 if @xmath63 .",
    "one thus expects the quasiperiodic self - similarity to appear in the energy spectra , transmission and , possibly , the conductance . in terms of the matrix",
    "@xmath64 the transmission coefficient becomes @xmath65,\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath66 denotes the transpose of a matrix .",
    "the conductance @xmath67 is calculated from the landauer - bttiker formula @xcite by averaging the electron flow over half the fermi surface , @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the angle between the velocity of incidence and the tunneling axis @xmath4 , @xmath62 is the incident energy , and the conductance is expressed in units of the quantity @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the velocity of the incident electrons and @xmath72 the width of the sample .",
    "we show in figure 2 typical transmission spectra for different transverse wavenumbers and fibonacci sequences @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the magnetic structure parameters are chosen as @xmath75 . from the left to the right column , @xmath20 is @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which corresponds to the equivalent fibonacci electric superlattices constructed from two square - well , two low square - barrier and two high square - barrier blocks , respectively . from the top",
    "to bottom row the transmission spectra are for @xmath73 and @xmath74 . respectively .",
    "as clearly shown in figure 2 , the transmission spectra for @xmath73 and @xmath74 are self - similar , i.e. , the transmission peak clusters and the transmission gaps for different fibonacci sequences are arranged in a very similar way , regardless of the value of the transverse wave - number @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the self - similar transmission spectra are the refection of the self - similarity in the corresponding energy spectra ( not shown ) .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the self - similarity of the transmission spectra more clearly .",
    "the first and second rows show that , regardless of the value of @xmath20 , the transmission bands are tribranching hierarchically in a self - similar way .",
    "it is the self - similarity between the whole and the local spectra .",
    "also one can readily observe the similarity between the transmission spectra of @xmath79 and @xmath74 at quite different scales .",
    "the third column shows in more detail this scaling property at @xmath80 as the length is increased .",
    "we notice in this data that the evolving structure has a six - circle symmetry , arising from the property @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , the scale change of the incident energy @xmath62 between the spectra for @xmath82 , @xmath79 and @xmath74 is given by the scaling index of the renormalization group transformation of the six - circle map @xmath83^{1/2}+2(1+i)$ ] @xcite .",
    "the self - similarities of the transmission spectra arise from the self - similar energy spectra ( not shown ) of this special structure .",
    "close inspection of the data in the third column shows in addition that there are states with transmission coefficient equal to unity , that persist as the length is increased ( arrows in the figure ) @xcite .",
    "these exotic extended states play a crucial role in the unusual length dependence of the conductance described below .",
    "numerical results for the conductance for structures @xmath84 , @xmath79 and @xmath74 are shown in fig .",
    "4 . the first column shows the development of further fine structure each time the fibonacci number increases , keeping the position of the main dips at each step roughly unchanged .",
    "although according to ( 5 ) the conductance is an average of transmission coefficients over half the fermi surface , self - similarity is still present , as made evident in the next two columns . in the center column",
    "we repeat the central panel of the first column in order to show how a change of scale produces a similar spectra in @xmath79 , while an increase in length ( @xmath74 ) gives more detailed structure , also similar to the whole pattern .",
    "the column in the right illustrates the six - circle scaling property of the conductance .",
    "close inspection of fig .",
    "4 also shows that as the length of the sample increases , the conductance decreases . to find out what governs this behavior we have calculated the conductance at incident energies @xmath85 and @xmath86 for different sample lengths @xmath87 , and plotted them in the upper ( @xmath88 ) and bottom panels ( @xmath89 ) of fig . 5 .",
    "we find that in all cases the conductance dependence in @xmath87 is bounded from below by a power law decrease @xcite . in order to investigate the possibility of a residual conductivity at infinite length , we include in the figures a fit using the function @xmath90 .",
    "we notice that in the upper panels the residual conductivity @xmath91 rises abruptly by four orders of magnitude when increasing the energy from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "closer study of this range shows that the rise occurs between @xmath94 and @xmath93 .",
    "we interpret the change as the capturing of one or more conducting channels by the convolution ( 5 ) , arising possibly from exotic extended states .",
    "the bottom panels , showing the special case @xmath54 , permit a check of this ansatz .",
    "since the conductance is a convolution over a range of wavenumbers @xmath20 , if at a particular value of this quantity an extended state is present , it will contribute to transport at infinite length . as may be easily checked , when @xmath54 the effective potential in eq .",
    "2 vanishes everywhere at wavenumber @xmath95 , a state captured by the convolution ( 2 ) at energies @xmath96 .",
    "the bottom panels show that a drop by several orders of magnitude occurs when this energy is approached from above , confirming that the loss of an extended state is indeed reflected in a large change in the conductance .",
    "this novel behavior is different from either the usual @xmath21 @xcite or the @xmath97 @xcite fibonaci systems .",
    "we attribute it as a manifestation of the presence of exotic extended states within the spectrum of a fibonacci structure . since the conductance is a convolution over a range of wavenumbers @xmath20 ,",
    "if at a particular value of this quantity an extended state is present , it will contribute to transport at infinite length .",
    "when such conducting channels are present , one may write @xmath98 , exhibiting the contributions from the critical and the extended states . since @xmath91 has no dependence on @xmath87 and @xmath99 @xcite , the conductance @xmath67",
    "may be approximated by the function @xmath100 , where @xmath101 .",
    "it can be expected @xmath102 due to the predominant weight of the critical channels .",
    "the self - similarities and the length - dependence of the transmission and conductance of a fibonacci magnetic superlattice reported above are robust with regard to changes in the particular shape of the magnetic barriers , and the choice of vector potential @xcite .",
    "this makes an experimental verification of the properties found very plausible .",
    "as our results suggest , a 2deg subject to the inhomogeneous magnetic field of a fibonacci or other quasiperiodic sequence of magnetic stripes deposited on a nearby parallel surface should exhibit self - similarity and an unusual length - dependence in the conductance perpendicular to the stripes .",
    "extended states along the direction perpendicular to the stripes may contribute or not to the bulk conductance depending on the energy of the incoming electrons .",
    "a possible experimental test of this finding is to measure the conductance as the fermi energy is varied by means of a gate voltage .",
    "the loss of extended states within the energy range available for transport would reveal a drop akin to a metal - insulator transition .",
    "in summary , we have discussed the quasiperiodic behavior of electrons in a fibonaci lateral magnetic superlattice . we have shown that its transmission and conductance possess both the self - similarity and six - circle properties found in other kinds of quasiperiodic systems .",
    "moreover , novel scaling properties of conductance with respect to the sample size in the tunneling direction have been found , exhibiting the presence of exotic extended states .",
