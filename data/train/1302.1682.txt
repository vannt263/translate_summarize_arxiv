    "it is of fundamental importance to study macroscopic behavior of open quantum systems under the influence of dissipative baths that they are inevitably in contact with @xcite .",
    "as an open quantum system and its thermal bath with a finite number of modes together form an isolated system which conserves the energy , according to the poincar recurrence theorem @xcite , the quantum system will eventually return to a state very close to its initial state . to circumvent this recurrence",
    ", the bath has to be expanded to contain an infinite number of phonon modes .",
    "the simplest model of a quantum system is a two - level system @xmath4 , and caldeira and leggett@xcite have shown that a bath of harmonic oscillator , @xmath5 , provides a very good approximation to real dissipative systems . here",
    "@xmath6 is a pauli matrix , and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the boson creation ( annihilation ) operator . in general , it is assumed that the two - level system is linearly coupled to the bath , @xmath9 . in the absence of the bath",
    ", the quantum two - level system will oscillate between the states @xmath10 and @xmath11 with frequency @xmath12 ( @xmath13 are the two eigenstates of @xmath14 ) , a quantum phenomenon which has no classical analog .",
    "putting together all three hamiltonian terms , @xmath15 the combined hamiltonian described by eq .",
    "( [ hami ] ) is called the spin - boson model .    despite its simplicity",
    ", the spin - boson model has been widely discussed in condensed phase physics and chemistry , ranging from the process of electron transfer @xcite to quantum entanglement @xcite between a qubit @xcite and its bath .",
    "the coupling between the two - level system and the harmonic bath is completely specified by the spectral function @xmath16 with a cutoff frequency @xmath17 and a dimensionless constant @xmath18 measuring the strength of the coupling .",
    "a bath described by a spectral function with @xmath19 is referred to as an ohmic bath .",
    "both static and dynamical properties of the spin - boson model with an ohmic bath are well understood @xcite .",
    "it is found that there exists a quantum phase transition from a non - degenerate delocalized phase to a doubly degenerate localized phase and a turnover from a coherent phase to an incoherent one .",
    "the critical coupling for the quantum phase transition is @xmath20 , and the critical coupling for the turnover to occur is @xmath21 . in the ohmic regime",
    ", the spin - boson model can be readily mapped onto the anisotropic kondo model using bosonization techniques@xcite , and known results can be borrowed from the kondo model . however , success still eludes us in arriving at a correct description of the spin - boson physics in the sub - ohmic regime ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "several sophisticated numerical methods have been used to study the sub - ohmic spin - boson model .",
    "an incomplete list includes : the numerical renormalization group method developed by wilson @xcite which reveals a continuous quantum phase transition for all @xmath22 and weakly damped coherent oscillations on short time scales in the localized phase @xcite ; numerically exact real - time path integral method with quasiadiabatic propagator revealing effective dynamic asymmetry in the presence of a sub - ohmic bath @xcite ; quantum monte carlo method which determines the critical exponents for @xmath23 @xcite ; the sparse polynomial space representation method which is based on the exact diagonalization to obtain numerical results@xcite ; the real - time path integral monte carlo techniques which show that the coherent phase exists even in strong dissipation for @xmath23 @xcite ; the numerically exact multilayer multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree method ( ml - mctdh ) which shows that the transition of the dynamics from weakly damped coherent motion to localization upon increase of the system - bath coupling strength @xcite .    unlike in the ohmic regime ,",
    "dynamics of sub - ohmic spin - boson model is very sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "there are two initial conditions of interest : one is the factorized initial condition with the bath in its vacuum state initially ; the other is the polarized initial condition consistent with typical experimental scenarios @xcite , under which the system is prepared in the ground state of @xmath24 .",
    "many recent studies use the polarized initial condition @xcite .",
    "the typical time scale of the spin dynamics is @xmath25 , the time it takes to hop from a spin state to another . on the other hand ,",
    "the reorganization energy @xcite , which describes the change in population disparity between the two states @xmath10 and @xmath11 as one goes from one initial condition to the other , is given as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the gamma function of @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite shows that the difference in spin dynamics under the two initial conditions is negligible for the ohmic bath in the scaling limit @xmath29 . however , reorganization energies in the sub - ohmic regime are larger than those in the ohmic regime .",
    "it implies that much more time is needed for a sub - ohmic bath to return to thermal equilibrium , and therefore the spin dynamics corresponding to the two initial conditions will display sizeable differences for certain parameter space ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "@xcite has confirmed such a physical picture .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the increasing of the spin - bath coupling will eventually turn quantum coherent oscillations into classical - like damping , a picture supported by the aforementioned numerical approaches for @xmath31 . however , ref .",
    "@xcite has recently claimed that such a picture may not always hold .",
    "numerical data in the strong coupling regime , for example , with @xmath32 , show that the coherent phase exists for exponents up to @xmath33 .",
    "such an  anomalous \" result warrants further investigations .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt a variational framework to study the zero temperature dynamical properties of the sub - ohmic spin - boson model .",
    "this is motivated by two facts : ( i ) the spin - bath interactions are formally identical to the exciton - phonon coupling in a quasiparticle named a polaron , which is generally described by the holstein model @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the exciton creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath37 is the hopping integral , and @xmath38 labels the exciton - phonon coupling strength ; ( ii ) a time - dependent variational approach based on the davydov anstze has been widely used for describing the dynamics of holstein systems . as a semi - classical approach for studying energy transport in deformable molecular chains ,",
    "those anstze @xcite were put forward by davydov and coworkers as two trial wave functions , namely , the davydov @xmath0 and @xmath39 anstze .",
    "the first of davydov s anstze has the form @xmath40|0\\rangle_{\\rm ph},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the variational parameters representing the exciton amplitude and the phonon displacements at the @xmath43th site , respectively , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the exciton and the phonon vacuum states , respectively .",

    "the davydov anstze and their variants have also been applied successfully to study the one - dimensional holstein polaron by zhao and coworkers @xcite . to probe polaron dynamics of the holstein system using davydov s anstze @xcite ,",
    "we have employed the dirac - frenkel time - dependent variational principle , a powerful technique to obtain approximate dynamics for quantum systems for which exact solutions are elusive @xcite .    by exploiting the analogy between the spin - boson model and the holstein molecular crystal model ,",
    "we propose a time - dependent trial wave function very similar to the davydov @xmath0 ansatz , and seek to develop an accurate description for dynamical properties of the sub - ohmic spin - boson model with @xmath49 under both the polarized and factorized initial conditions .",
    "it was pointed earlier @xcite that the davydov anstze bear close resemblance to a multiconfigurational ansatz which contains more than one slater determinant .",
    "we note that the ansatz employed in this work shares many characteristics with the multi - configurational gaussian wave packets @xcite , used in a variant of the powerful multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree technique ( mctdh ) @xcite , also known as the g - mctdh method .",
    "proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and developed further in refs .",
    "@xcite , the g - mctdh method extends mctdh to higher - dimensional systems by including a moving basis of gaussian functions while restricted to an optimally chosen subset of the bath modes .",
    "it has been successfully applied to describe dynamics of the henon - heiles potential model @xcite and the oscillator - bath model @xcite .    in the holstein molecular crystal model",
    ", a similar reorganization energy @xcite can be calculated from the phonon spectral density function using @xmath50 , and is known to be proportional to the huang - rhys factor @xcite , which measures the exciton - phonon coupling strength .",
    "for the factorized initial conditions , our previous studies on the holstein model reveal that the davydov anstz are especially accurate in the strong exciton - phonon coupling regime@xcite , a fact that will also be confirmed by calculating the relative deviation for the sub - ohmic spin - boson model studied here @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for a given spin - bath coupling strength , a smaller @xmath28 yields a smaller relative deviation , inferring the highest accuracy of our ansatz in the deep sub - ohmic regime @xmath51 .",
    "a similar trend is believed for the polarized initial conditions .",

    "iv , conclusions are drawn .",
