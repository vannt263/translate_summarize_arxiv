    "vlbi observations of high redshift quasars at centimeter wavelengths allow to address two connected topics :    _ ( 1 ) frequency - dependent properties of the milliarcsecond structures in quasars . _",
    "an image obtained at a received frequency @xmath6 represents the source structure at a higher emitted frequency @xmath7 thus facilitating a direct comparison between radio structures at a given frequency in high redshift quasars and their low redshift counterparts observed at a higher frequency @xmath8 .",
    "_ ( 2 ) cosmological tests using the milliarcsecond structure of qsos as a `` standard '' object . _ as shown in several recent studies , the `` apparent angular size ",
    "redshift '' ( @xmath9 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and `` proper motion ",
    "redshift '' ( @xmath10 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) relation on milliarcsecond scales have a potential to provide meaningful cosmological information . in this respect ,",
    "sources at extremely high redshifts are of special interest .",
    "in this paper we present a vsop ( vlbi space observatory programme , @xcite ) observation of the high - redshift quasar pks2215 + 020 .",
    "the observations have been conducted as part of a vsop study of extremely high redshift quasars .",
    "the complete results of this project will be presented elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the vsop is a space vlbi ( svlbi ) mission utilizing an orbiting 8meter antenna deployed on the japanese satellite halca ( @xcite ) and the worldwide array of radio telescopes .",
    "the satellite has an elliptical orbit , with the apogee and perigee heights at @xmath11  21000 km and @xmath11  560 km , respectively , and orbiting period of roughly 6 hours . in each observation ,",
    "data from the satellite are recorded by a network of up to 5 tracking stations , and subsequently correlated with the data from participating ground radio telescopes .",
    "regular vsop observations started in september 1997 at 1.6 and 5ghz .",
    "a 1.6ghz vsop observation of pks2215 + 020 described here was made on september 14 - 15 , 1997 .",
    "pks2215 + 020 is an optically faint ( @xmath12 ) , radio - loud quasar ( @xmath13 - 0.6jy ; @xcite , @xcite ) included in the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has an emission redshift , @xmath14 ( @xcite ) ; a corresponding linear scale of 3.38@xmath2pcmas@xmath4 ( for the hubble constant @xmath15kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 and deceleration parameter @xmath16 ) .",
    "the radio spectral index of 2215 + 020 is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "siebert & brinkmann ( 1998 ) have observed x - ray emission from 2215 + 020 with the rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) , and found only marginal evidence for possible elongation along the @xmath19-@xmath20 .",
    "we observed the quasar pks2215 + 020 at 1.6ghz , using the halca satellite and a global vlbi array of 15 ground - based radio telescopes ( table  [ tb : observation ] ) .",
    "the observation lasted for 10 hours , with halca data recorded for 7 hours .",
    "the data were recorded in the vlba format ( @xcite ) , with a total observing bandwidth of 32mhz divided in two intermediate frequency ( if ) bands , each having 256 spectral channels .",
    "the tracking stations in green bank and goldstone ( usa ) were used for the halca data acquisition .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro ( @xcite ) , with a pre  averaging time of 1.966 and 0.524sec for the ground  ground and space  ground baselines respectively .",
    "fringe visibilities were detected in the halca data recorded at both tracking stations .",
    "the resulting sampling function ( _ uv_-coverage ) of the final correlated dataset is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , indicating an improvement of resolution by a factor of @xmath12.5 compared to ground  based vlbi observations at the same frequency , owing to the ground ",
    "space baselines .",
    "we used aips and the difmap program ( @xcite ) for post - processing of the correlated dataset .",
    "the a priori amplitude calibration was determined from the antenna gain and system temperature measurements , including that of the halca radio telescope ( @xcite ) . after inspecting the if bandpasses , the last 46 channels in each if were deleted , owing to a cutoff in the filter bandpass .",
    "this has reduced the effective observing bandwidth to 26.2mhz .",
    "we corrected the residual delays and rates , using single - band ( sb ) and multi - band ( mb ) fringe fitting ( @xcite ) with solution intervals of 5 minutes , and accepted all solutions with @xmath21 . to improve the snr on the space  ground baseline solutions , we fringe",
    "fitted the halca data , using the source model obtained by imaging the ground  ground vlbi data .",
    "after the fringe fitting , the residual phase variations on the ground  ground baselines were within 3@xmath22 , and within @xmath23 , on the space  ground baselines .",
    "we then averaged over all frequency channels , and calibrated the phases with a point source model ( to enable time averaging ) .",
    "finally , the data were exported into difmap and further time  averaged into 60second bins .",
    "the amplitude and phase errors were re - calculated in difmap , from the scatter in the unaveraged data .",
    "the estimated rms noise on the halca baselines was about 4 times higher than on the ground ",
    "ground baselines , consistent with the smaller antenna size and higher system temperature of the halca radio telescope . the amplitude visibility distribution obtained after the amplitude calibration and fringe  fitting is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "from the final fringe  fitted dataset , we produced two images : a )  an image with all data included ( vsop image , hereafter ) , and b )  an image using only the ground  ground baseline data included ( gvlbi image , hereafter ) . in both cases , uniform weighting is used , and gridding weights are scaled inversely with the amplitude errors .",
    "the resulting images are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , and their basic characteristics are presented in table  [ tb : images ] .",
    "the images in figure  [ fig3 ] show a clear core  jet type morphology .",
    "we note that the general milliarcsecond - scale morphology of pks2215 + 020 described here is consistent with the vlba 15 ghz image ( @xcite ) . in the gvlbi image",
    ", we identify the core , c , and 7 enhanced emission regions ( jet components j1j7 , hereafter ) which we will discuss below .",
    "the jet extends up to almost 80mas from the core , and shows a particularly wide , bright section between 45 and 60mas ( 150200@xmath2pc projected distance ) , suggesting a possible working surface of a young jet propagating in a dense ambient medium .",
    "the basic structures appear to be similar , in both images shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , taking into account the larger noise and scatter of the data on the space  ground baselines , which results in the increased rms noise and stronger deconvolution effects in the vsop image .",
    "these effects can be countered by using the natural weighting for the vsop dataset .",
    "we find that the resolution and sensitivity of an image of 2215 + 020 obtained from the naturally weighted vsop data are practically identical to those of the uniformly weighted ground vlbi data from our observation ( which is commonly expected for vsop observations ; @xcite ) .",
    "since our goal is to study the jet at highest resolution , we will discuss exclusively the uniformly weighted data represented by the images in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the most interesting difference between the two images shown in figure  [ fig3 ] is the absence of the component j4 in the vsop image .",
    "the adjacent features j3 and j5 can be identified in both images , even though , in the gvlbi image , they appear to be weaker than j4 .",
    "it is not immediately clear whether this effect results from unidentified imaging problems , or reflects in fact the true nature of j4 ( which may be completely resolved in the vsop image ) .",
    "deconvolution effects are visible elsewhere in the two images ( for instance , in the vsop image , j6 appears being split into two features ) . on the other hand ,",
    "deconvolution alone is not likely to completely eliminate a feature . in order to provide quantitative criteria for deciding upon this issue , we turn now to modeling the source structure using the interferometric visibility data ( @xcite ) .",
    "to model the jet structure in 2215 + 020 , we first use difmap to fit the ground baseline data by 8 circular gaussian components ( marked in figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we shall call this model `` the gvlbi model '' .",
    "the gvlbi model is then used as a starting guess for modeling the visibilities in the entire vsop dataset .",
    "the resulting model ( `` the vsop model , '' hereafter ) contains only 7 of the original 8 components .",
    "the component corresponding to feature j4 is indeed completely resolved in the vsop data . in the vsop model ,",
    "the formal size of j4 exceeds 20mas , with the flux of the feature being similar to that in the vlbi model .",
    "we take this as evidence in favor of our suggestion that j4 is completely resolved in the vsop data .",
    "the derived component parameters are listed in table  [ tb : modelfit ] , for both the gvlbi and vsop models . to estimate the uncertainties of the fitted component parameters , we measure , for each feature , the peak flux density , @xmath24 and its rms , in the respective image .",
    "we then calculate the uncertainties using approximations given by fomalont ( 1989 ) .    in several features ,",
    "both in the gvlbi and vsop data , the fitted sizes appear to be smaller than the resolution limit . in order to determine which of the fitted values should be considered only as upper limit",
    ", we derive , for each feature , its smallest detectable size of a circular gaussian component in an image with rms noise @xmath25 : @xmath26^{1/2}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the flux density of the feature , and @xmath28 are the major and minor axes of the restoring beam , respectively . for those features in which @xmath29 , we take @xmath30 as the upper limit estimate of the size .    using the calculated flux densities and sizes , we calculate brightness temperatures , @xmath31 , for all jet features . for most of the calculated @xmath31 ,",
    "formal errors are of the order of 100% ( perhaps indicating that the measured rms errors of @xmath24 are too conservative ) .",
    "we therefore regard the derived values of @xmath31 as first order estimates .",
    "the component sizes and calculated brightness temperatures are plotted in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the vsop observation shows several very interesting properties of the jet in 2215 + 020 .",
    "the observed extent of the jet ( @xmath32pc ) is remarkable .",
    "the structures observed in 2215 + 020 are almost ten times larger than in any other quasars at @xmath33 observed with vlbi ( c.f . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the morphology of the source suggests that the component j1 may be a working surface of the jet . from the jet expansion presented in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    ", we estimate that the jet opening angle should vary between 2^@xmath34and 7^@xmath34(with the smaller value obtained not taking into account the two most peculiar features : j4 , and j1 ) .",
    "these values must also be corrected by a deprojection factor , @xmath35 . however , considering the unusually large extent of the jet , the effect of deprojection is not likely to be strong .",
    "the observed brightness temperatures plotted in figure  [ fig4 ] can be used to probe the physics of the jet .",
    "following marscher ( 1990 ) , we assume that each of the jet components is an independent plane shock in which the radio emission is dominated by adiabatic energy losses .",
    "the jet plasma has a power law energy distribution , @xmath36 , and the magnetic field is assumed to vary as @xmath37 .",
    "the doppler factor is assumed to be constant or varying weakly throughout the jet . under these assumptions",
    ", one can relate the brightness temperature , @xmath38 , of each jet component to the brightness temperature of the core , @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the respective measured sizes of the core and jet feature , and @xmath42 .",
    "we take @xmath43 ( corresponding to synchrotron emission with a spectral index @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( which corresponds to the transverse orientation of magnetic field in the jet ) .",
    "the measured value , @xmath46 , is used for the core .",
    "we use the sizes and upper limits measured in the vsop image , and add the gvlbi measurement for j4 .",
    "the resulting brightness temperatures are indicated in figure  [ fig4 ] by thick dashed line .",
    "the measured and model values of brightness temperatures agree rather well , suggesting that the jet components may indeed be a collection of relativistic shocks .",
    "the discrepancy between the model and observed brightness temperatures is significant only in the outermost jet feature , j1 , for which we find a ratio @xmath47 .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that j1 is a region of the jet where physical conditions may have become substantially different .",
    "if j1 interacts with the ambient medium , its material may be going through additional compression and reacceleration , which could lead to a localized increase of the brightness temperature .",
    "the observed discrepancy between our model and the measured brightness temperature of j1 may also be explained by variations of the jet doppler factor , resulting from changes of the speed or orientation of the jet . for this case , one can derive for the doppler factor of j1 , @xmath48 ( here @xmath49 is the doppler factor in the rest of jet ) .",
    "this condition implies a jet bulk lorentz factor @xmath50 and viewing angle @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "we find then that the lorentz factor in j1 must be 4050% lower than in the rest of the jet ( @xmath52 is lower than @xmath53 because @xmath54 , so the jet has to be doppler  deboosted , and its viewing angle must be @xmath55 , even for @xmath53 as high as 15 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the bulk lorentz factor is constant throughout the entire jet , the direction of the flow entering the region of j1 must change by 2030@xmath56 with respect to the line of sight .      for the feature j4 , which is resolved out in the vsop image , the linear size derived from the gvlbi data is @xmath57 mas ( @xmath58 pc ) .",
    "if this size is related to the physical transverse dimension of the jet , the mass of the central object can be estimated , assuming that the jet is collimated by the ambient magnetic field of the host galaxy ( e.g. appl & camenzind 1992 , 1993 , @xcite ) .",
    "on parsec scales , the width of a jet can often be underestimated , owing to limited resolution and dynamic range of vlbi observations . in 2215 + 020 ,",
    "the jet feature j4 is arguably the best measure of the width of the jet , as this feature is the only one resolved out in the vsop image , and its size ( 6.2mas ) measured in the gvlbi image is significantly larger than the respective limiting resolution ( 2.3mas ) .",
    "the measured sizes of other jet features ( except j1 ) are most likely affected by the limited resolution and dynamic range of the data , and therefore are likely to be smaller than the true jet width . finally , j1 is unsuitable for estimating the central black hole mass because it is most likely a strongly perturbed region , actively interacting with the external medium .    for a jet collimated by the ambient magnetic field , @xmath59 , of the host galaxy ,",
    "the mass of the central object , @xmath60 , can be related to the width of the jet , @xmath61 , so that ( @xcite ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the gravitational constant , @xmath64 is the schwarzschild radius of the the central black hole , and @xmath65 is the magnetic field measured at @xmath64 . equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) refers to the transverse dimension of the jet measured at distances comparable to the collimation scale ( typically expected to be located at 1001000@xmath64 ) .",
    "a typical galactic magnetic field is @xmath66 g ( @xcite ) , and one can expect to have @xmath67 g ( @xcite ) . with these estimates , we obtain @xmath68 . since j4 is located at about 80 pc distance from the jet core , its size is most likely affected by the expansion of the jet",
    ". this effect may result in overestimating the mass of the central black hole by @xmath69% ( assuming a jet opening angle of @xmath70 ) .",
    "for the mass of the central black hole in m87 , based on images from ground vlbi observations made at 1.6 ghz ( @xcite ) .",
    "this estimate is comparable with the value of @xmath71 deduced from hst observations of m87 ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "the jet direction observed in our vlbi images is consistent with the extension seen in a vla observation ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) on a scale of 7 arcseconds ( 23@xmath2kpc ) .",
    "most interestingly , a similar extension is suggested by the rosat hri image ( rosat archive directory 701900h ) .",
    "siebert & brinkmann ( 1998 ) argued that the extension of the emission in the rosat image may result from the asymmetrical point ",
    "spread function of the hri . in figure",
    "[ fig6 ] , we overlay the rosat and vla images of 2215 + 020 .",
    "given the remarkable morphological similarity of the x  ray and radio emission , we tend to conclude that the extension seen in the rosat may be real .",
    "this would imply that 2215 + 020 contains an x  ray emitting gas extending out to about 50@xmath2kpc .",
    "the x - ray emission may then arise from interaction between the relativistic outflow and a dense circumgalactic gas .",
    "it is however not possible to say at present whether the emission on this scales is directly related to the outflow observed on parsec scales .",
    "recent observations with chandra x  ray satellite ( marshall et al .",
    "2000 ) have indicated similar coincidence of radio and x  ray emission distributions in several extragalactic radio sources , most notably in ngc1275 , allowing to speculate that radio lobes may be pushing the x  ray emitting gas outwards .",
    "a similar scenario may be at work in 2215 + 020 .",
    "the main results from the observations reported in this paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the radio source pks2215 + 020 has a rich core ",
    "jet morphology and unusually large size of the jet which can be traced up to 300@xmath2 parsecs .",
    "this is by far the longest jet observed at redshifts above 3 .",
    "the arcsecond  scale structure detected in pks2215 + 020 with the vla coincides with the extension observed in the rosat x  ray image , implying a possible presence of an x  ray emitting gas extending out to about 50@xmath2 kiloparsecs .",
