    "modulation instability ( mi ) is a nonlinear process in which a weak perturbation is exponentially amplified by an intense field .",
    "mi has been investigated in many sub - fields of physics , especially in optics for the relative simplicity to perform experiments , in both homogeneous and periodical media  @xcite .",
    "the additional degree of freedom brought by the periodicity has catched the attention of many research groups and has led to many theoretical and experimental works , in spatial  @xcite and temporal kerr media such as optical fibers  @xcite .",
    "this physical flexibility is of particular interest since the modulation period can be varied from the meter range up to tens of kilometers , leading to a large window of investigation . in the early nineties ,",
    "the rise of optical telecommunication networks has led to the deployment of `` natural '' periodic optical fiber systems due to the alternation of all - optical regeneration devices and/or dispersion managed lines  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fundamental interest brought by these systems , it was then necessary to understand in depth the origin of the characteristic spurious mi sidebands  @xcite which are highly detrimental for telecommunications since they are generated in the ghz range  @xcite due to their period in the range of kilometers .",
    "a lot of theoretical studies have therefore been initiated in this context  @xcite .",
    "very recently , dispersion management was pushed one step further with the experimental demonstration of mi in continuously modulated waveguides  @xcite . from these results ,",
    "the spurious consequence of the mi sidebands due to the periodicity can be turned into benefits since these works show the possibility to obtain multiple parametric gain bands in the thz range .",
    "it should then provide another degree of freedom for designing optical systems requiring broad bandwidths such as in all optical signal processing systems where there is a growing demand .",
    "while a deep theoretical study of mi in periodically tapered fibers has been reported very recently  @xcite , we propose in the present work a simplified analytical treatment allowing to accurately describe the mi dynamics and to tailor the overall shape of its multi - peak spectrum . besides providing insight into the underlying physics ,",
    "our analytical treatment allows to derive an expression for the local linear parametric gain for the first time .",
    "finally , in order to illustrate the practical interest of this simple analysis , we report experiments in which the multi - peak mi spectrum has been tailored to suppress one mi sideband or to favor a single strong one , in good agreement with our analytical predictions .",
    "we recently reported the first striking experimental demonstration of mi in a dispersion oscillating fiber ( dof )  @xcite .",
    "although details can be found in  @xcite , the aim of this section is to briefly summarize our previous results in order to facilitate the reading of the present paper .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a measurement of the evolution of the fiber diameter along its length .",
    "the outer diameter follows a sine shape with a modulation amplitude of @xmath0 and a period @xmath1 of 10  m , which results in a dispersion modulation over the fiber length @xmath2 with a quasi - sinusoidal shape over the wavelength range of interest here , written as @xmath3 where @xmath4  s@xmath5/m is the average second order dispersion and @xmath6  s@xmath5/m is the amplitude modulation at our pump wavelength of 1072  nm .    ) versus fiber length obtained from experiments ( circles ) and numerical simulations ( solid line ) .",

    "the solid line represents the spectrum resulting from the numerical integration of the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation ( gnlse ) seeded by noise to accurately reproduce experimental random initial conditions ( all details and parameters are given in  @xcite ) .",
    "both spectra are in good agreement ( except for the higher experimental noise floor ) and show the generation of multiple mi sidebands pairs  @xcite spanning over more than 10  thz .",
    "the frequency of these parametric sidebands can be roughly estimated from a quasi - phase - matching relation developed in the case of an infinitely long grating  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an integer , @xmath11 is the pulsation detuning from the pump and @xmath12 is the average nonlinear coefficient of the dof .",
    "the dynamics of the mi process with fiber length was investigated by cutting back the dof and recording output spectra . as an illustration ,",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows the evolution of the power of the first sideband ( @xmath13 ) versus fiber length obtained from experiments ( circles ) and numerical simulations ( solid line ) .",
    "the dynamics observed both in experiments and simulations exhibits periodic regions of deamplification , which makes the side lobe power oscillate along the fiber around the exponential growth ( expected for a perfectly phase - matched process ) .",
    "such a dynamics is expected from quasi - phase - matched processes , but it differs from the one observed in second - order nonlinear crystals in which there are no regions of deamplification .",
    "this particular and unusual feature will now be studied in detail with help of a simple and intuitive analytical model , in order to provide further insight into the underlying physics .",
    "it is well established that the mi process can be interpreted in the spectral domain as a four - wave mixing ( fwm ) process  @xcite . in this frame , the parametric fwm gain spectrum can be obtained by studying the stability of the steady state solution against weak perturbations through a so - called linear stability analysis . in dispersion",
    "managed optical systems , this tool has allowed to analytically predict the complex multi - peak gain spectrum  @xcite , but such an analysis does not provide any clear insight into the dynamics of the process nor any details about the fine evolution of the field over a single modulation period of the fiber . to this aim ,",
    "we propose here a more intuitive explanation of the results from ref .",
    "@xcite by revisiting a simplified truncated three - wave model usually aimed at describing fermi - pasta - ulam recurrence and fiber - optic parametric amplification  @xcite .",
    "this model allows to account for the relative phase variations between pump , signal and idler waves during propagation . in our work",
    ", it will be induced by the longitudinal variations of dispersion rather than pump depletion .",
    "our starting point is the four coupled differential equations given by eqs .  3 in ref .",
    "we neglect fiber loss , we assume that the pump remains undepleted and that signal and idler powers , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are much less than the pump power @xmath7 over the whole dof length .",

    "[ eqpm ] and experimental / numerical values mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite can now be understood from eq .",
    "[ eq2c ] . indeed , eq .  [ eqpm ] assumes that the nonlinear phase mismatch can be approximated by @xmath19  @xcite , while eq .",

    "this does not impact the validity of the present results since this additional term remain low for the pump powers involved in the present study . in order to obtain a simple analytic solution of the set of eqs .",
    "[ eq2 ] , we thus neglect the last term @xmath21 $ ] in eq .",
    "it physically means that we assume that the longitudinal evolution of the nonlinear phase mismatch term is weak as compared to the linear and uniform nonlinear phase mismatch terms , which is valid for low pump powers . by integrating the set of eqs .",
    "[ eq2 ] , we find that the total accumulated gain of the signal in power writes as @xmath22+\\frac{1}{4 } [ 1+\\rho + 2\\sqrt{\\rho } ] \\mathrm{exp } \\left[\\int_0^z g(\\omega , z')dz'\\right ] \\label{eqgain}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 . in the following",

    "thus , eq .  [ eqg ] indicates that the linear gain @xmath30 at a fixed pulsation detuning @xmath17 can be interpreted as the sum of sine functions in @xmath2 .",
    "these sine functions all have a zero average value except when their argument becomes independent of @xmath2 .",
    "it only occurs at specific spectral components @xmath17 ( equal to the pulsation @xmath11 in eq .",

    "this last term therefore prevails over the other ones on the gain @xmath32 for long enough propagation distances .",
    "thus the linear gain of the @xmath33 spectral component mainly depends on this uniform term as long as the fiber exceeds a few modulation periods .",

    "[ eq2 ] ( black lines ) and our analytical result ( red lines ) is here excellent both for the evolution of the gain and of the phase .",

    "indeed , this relative phase @xmath18 would grow linearly in the absence of the modulation term ( @xmath57 ) in eq .",
    "[ eq2c ]  @xcite .",
    "this linear growth would lead to amplification and deamplification phases of same length and consequently the total accumulated gain would be negligible .    from a more practical point of view , the frequency of the spectral component @xmath11 can be widely modified simply by changing the periodicity of the grating ( as in a diffraction grating for the position of its different orders ) , while the gain ( analogous to the diffraction efficiency in a specific order ) can be modulated independently through the ratio @xmath58 .",

    "these two processes are by nature different  @xcite since kelly sidebands originate from the destabilization of solitons and subsequent emission of resonant dispersive waves in active fiber cavities  @xcite , while the mi process investigated here is a four - photon mixing process and therefore has a parametric origin .",
