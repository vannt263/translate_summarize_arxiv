    "the photo - assisted electric current through an insulating barrier is the topic of a large number of studies both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite in a wide range of systems , such as for example : quantum dots , normal or superconducting tunnel junctions , and luttinger liquids . in the presence of a voltage modulation",
    ", the electrons can emit or absorb photons when they travel across the barrier and the resulting current is thus a superposition of dc currents .",
    "when the current - voltage characteristic is non - linear , it leads to a specific behavior for the current.@xcite    this is only recently that the study of photo - assisted heat current has emerged . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the heat flow generated by an adiabatic quantum pump through a mesoscopic sample has been studied@xcite , as well as the photo - assisted heat flow in a normal metal / superconductor junction@xcite .",
    "non - adiabatic pumping heat in an asymmetric double quantum dot has also been considered@xcite .",
    "even more recently , the chiral heat transport in driven quantum hall edges states@xcite and the microwave - mediated heat transport and thermoelectric effect in a quantum dot in the presence of coulomb interaction@xcite have been calculated . on the experimental side ,",
    "measurements of seebeck voltage has been performed in magnetic tunnel junctions in the presence of a frequency modulated laser used to heat up the device@xcite .",
    "the formalism that has been developed@xcite to calculate the time - dependent heat current with the help of out - of - equilibrium green s functions allows to treat any type of time - dependent voltages , in particular a modulated one .",
    "it is therefore the appropriate formalism that has to be used when one considers time - dependent excitation in the quantum regime .",
    "it enables not only to calculate the photo - assisted electric and heat currents but also , as done here for the first time , the photo - assisted peltier coefficient since this last quantity is defined as the ratio between the heat current and the electric current in the absence of temperature gradient .",
    "however , this formalism does not make possible the calculation of the photo - assisted seebeck coefficient .",
    "indeed , whereas this quantity is generally measured in an open circuit , it is not straightforward in such a calculation to ensure the cancellation of the electric current , except in the linear regime@xcite which is not the one we consider here .",
    "even if several theoretical works are devoted to the photo - assisted heat current in quantum dots@xcite , they are restricted to the calculation of its time average value which corresponds to the zero - order harmonic . a detailed study of higher order harmonics is still missing .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to fill this lack .",
    "this will allow us to know if the heat current through the junction will follow the time evolution of the modulated gate voltage , i.e. , if it is sinusoidal , or if it has a more complicated profile .",
    "a careful study of the heat current and peltier coefficient according to the amplitude and the frequency of the modulation , as done here , is thus needed .",

    "the energy level of the quantum dot can be modulated in time by tuning the gate voltage , we denote it @xmath4 .",
    "we use the following hamiltonian to describe this system : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy band of the reservoir l or r. the notations @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) refer to the creation and annihilation operators associated to the reservoirs ( dot ) .",

    "the quantities @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond respectively to the heat , the energy and the number of particles in the left  ( l ) or right  ( r ) reservoirs .",
