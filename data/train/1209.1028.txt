    "as a backbone of many complex systems , complex networks have been intensively studied in the past decade .",
    "examples range from social relationships among individuals , to interactions of proteins in biological systems , to the interdependence of function calls in large software projects .",
    "the network analysis has greatly helped us understand the structure and function of real - world systems  @xcite .",
    "bipartite network is an important kind of complex network , which is composed of two types of nodes with no links connecting nodes of the same type .",
    "for example , the e - commercial systems consisting of online users and products  @xcite , the scientific collaboration system consisting of authors and papers  @xcite , and family name inheritance system consisting of babies and names  @xcite are naturally described by such networks .",
    "recently , some topological properties such as clustering coefficient and modularity of bipartite networks have been studied  @xcite . however , one of the most difficult hurdles in analyzing and visualizing bipartite network is the size of the real - world systems .",
    "the online commercial systems , for instance , can have thousands of products and even millions of users . given that most of the algorithms which are used to extract the properties of the bipartite network run in times that grow polynomially with the system size @xmath0 , systems with huge sizes become a challenge .    in order to deal with the problem mentioned above , a promising way is to consider some units of the system as almost indistinguishable and to merge them into one , i.e. , to reduce the number of nodes and edges by means of a mapping of the network with @xmath0 nodes and @xmath1 edges into a smaller one with @xmath2 nodes and @xmath3 edges . based on this concept ,",
    "several coarse graining schemes for binary networks including @xmath4-core decomposition  @xcite , box - covering process  @xcite , geographical coarse graining  @xcite , spectral coarse graining  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "specifically , the @xmath4-core decomposition intends to classify nodes into different shells which represent their importance .",
    "this technique can be used to isolate the central core of a network , and was also shown to be extremely effective for visualization purposes .",
    "the box - covering technique yields a new network which can preserve some of the topological features of the original ones .",
    "the geographical coarse graining uses a renormalization - group like numerical analysis to reduce the size of the networks while preserving the degree distribution , clustering coefficient and assortativity correlation .",
    "the spectral coarse graining methods , on the other hand , focus on the dynamic processes taking place on networks .",
    "they merge nodes based on the eigenvectors of different matrices , so that some dynamic properties such as random walk and synchronization of the original network are kept unchanged .",
    "mathematically , the spectral - based methods are expressed as preserving some eigenvalues of the stochastic matrix or the graph laplacian .",
    "furthermore , some works have been further dedicated to coarse grain networks for dynamics of heterogeneous oscillators  @xcite and other critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "actually , a very close related problem is the community detection which groups nodes based on link density . because of the importance and the complexity of finding meaningful communities , it is a fact that recent years have witnessed an explosion of research on community structure in graphs , and a huge number of methods or techniques have been designed  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , there is often no clear statement on which properties of the initial network are preserved in the network of clusters .",
    "though the coarse graining methods mentioned above are effective in binary networks , they usually have some limitations when extended to directed and bipartite networks . in directed networks , the role of nodes in dynamics can not be well characterized by the eigenvectors since imaginary value emerges when the adjacency and laplacian matrix are asymmetric .",
    "this problem can be solved by directly using the paths to determine the similarity between nodes and finally preserve the dynamics properties ( synchronization ) when merging nodes  @xcite .",
    "for bipartite networks , the situation can be even more complicated .",
    "there are two types of nodes in bipartite networks and the dynamics on both types of nodes should be preserved .",
    "more importantly , the coarse graining method should preserve the intrinsic bipartite feature of the networks ( i.e. no link exists between nodes in each same type ) .",
    "however , if we regard the bipartite networks as binary ones and apply previous coarse graining methods , it will end up with merging nodes from different types into one .",
    "furthermore , using the existing community detection methods to coarse grain bipartite networks may significantly change the network function  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "it is still a challenge to preserve both the network function and the bipartite property .    in this paper , employing random walks to be the main characteristic  @xcite",
    ", we introduce a new spectral - based approach to coarse grain bipartite networks . unlike the coarse graining methods for binary networks , our goal is to obtain a reduced bipartite network that preserves both the original random walk properties and the bipartite feature . in order to preserve the random walk properties of both types of nodes , two matrices ( denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) based on the stochastic matrix of the bipartite network are introduced , and a new coarse grain scheme relied on @xmath5 and @xmath6 is designed .",
    "the obtained network remains bipartite and have very similar spectral properties to the original bipartite network .",
    "moreover , we validate our method by performing a direct test of the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) to artificial and real - world bipartite networks .",
    "the new method is robust in various kinds of bipartite networks and the choices of sinks .",
    "finally , we remark that this method can be easily extend to preserve many other of spectral - determined dynamical properties in bipartite networks .",
    "random walks play a central role in dynamical properties taking place on complex networks . starting at some specified initial vertices , the walker jumps with equal probability from its current location to one of its nearest neighbors at each time step . considering a binary network @xmath7 with @xmath0 nodes .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath8 is the matrix with elements @xmath9 if there is an edge connecting vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 , otherwise @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the probability that the walker is at vertex @xmath10 at time step @xmath14 .",
    "if the walker is at vertex @xmath11 at time step @xmath15 , the probability of taking a jump along any of its neighbors is @xmath16 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath13 on an undirected binary network is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the degree of vertex @xmath11 .",
    "as a matrix form , eq .",
    "[ equation1 ] can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vector with elements @xmath21 and * d * is the diagonal matrix with the degrees of the vertices down its diagonal @xmath22 . defining a stochastic matrix @xmath23 , random walk in binary network",
    "can be characterized by the stochastic matrix * w * , and the element @xmath24 describes the probability that a walker starts from node @xmath10 to node @xmath11 .    in the context of transport phenomena or",
    "search on a network , mfpt ( mean first passage time ) is an important characteristic of random walks  @xcite . to compute it exactly , one usually considers some nodes as traps .",
    "the normalized laplacian matrix of the network is defined as @xmath25 , where * i * is the identity matrix .",
    "we use @xmath26 to denote the set of traps and @xmath27 to represent the number of traps . for simplicity , we distinguish all nodes in the network by assigning each of them a unique number .",
    "we label consecutively all nodes , excluding those in @xmath26 , from 1 to @xmath28 and sinks are labeled from @xmath29 to @xmath0 . by suppressing the last @xmath27 rows and columns of the normalized laplacian matrix , we obtain a submatrix of the normalized laplacian matrix * l * as @xmath30 .    it is shown in  @xcite that the trapping time or the first passage time @xmath31 , which is defined as a particle first arriving at any one of the traps , given that it starts from node @xmath10 , can be expressed as follows , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the elements of matrix @xmath30 .",
    "then the mfpt @xmath34 , which is defined as the average of @xmath31 over all initial nodes distributed uniformly over nodes including the traps , is given by @xmath35 eq . [ equation3 ] can also be found in the literature in several equivalent forms@xcite .",
    "thus the exact solution of the mfpt of the unbiased random walk is given , independently from the number and the location of the sinks .",
    "[ equation2 ] and eq .",
    "[ equation3 ] are very necessary since they can reduce the problem of computing the mfpt to calculating the inverse matrix @xmath30 and also can be used to check the mfpt of different networks in the following sections , at least for networks with relatively small size .      in bipartite networks ,",
    "connection between vertices is also described by the adjacency matrix . however , since a bipartite network consists of two non - overlapping kinds of nodes and the links can only exist between two nodes from distinct sets .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath8 of a bipartite network is defined as a matrix with order @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath0 are the number of vertices of these two distinct sets . in this paper , we call two types of nodes as top and bottom nodes , respectively . if there is a link between vertices @xmath10 in the top sets and @xmath11 in the bottom sets , the element @xmath38 , otherwise @xmath39 . in bipartite networks ,",
    "the random walk process is closely related to the information filtering algorithms  @xcite . unlike binary networks",
    ", the stochastic matrix of a bipartite network is divided into two matrices .",
    "if a walker goes from the top set to the bottom set , the stochastic matrix @xmath40 is with order @xmath36 with elements @xmath41 which describe the probability from node @xmath10 in the top set to node @xmath11 in the bottom set .",
    "if the walker is from the bottom set to the top set , then @xmath42 is with order @xmath43 in which @xmath44 . @xmath40 and @xmath42 contained all the information of random walk in bipartite network .",
    "now we define two new matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 as follows : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "just like the stochastic matrix in binary networks , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are square matrices .",
    "@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) describes the random walkers going from top ( bottom ) nodes to top ( bottom ) nodes .",
    "these two matrices have some interesting properties . in particular ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue of these two matrices is equal to @xmath47 and the corresponding eigenvector is constant .",
    "moreover , there are several largest eigenvalues of these two matrices with the same value .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues close to @xmath47 of the stochastic matrix * w * capture the large - scale behavior of the random walk in binary network .",
    "the fact is also true in @xmath5 and @xmath6 in bipartite network since they are square matrices just like * w*. as a result , our goal is to preserve the largest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this way , we can preserve the properties of random walk in bipartite network .",
    "first of all , two nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 with exactly the same neighbors should be merged since they can not be distinguished from the point of view of random walk . in terms of a eigenvector @xmath48 for any @xmath49 of @xmath5 or @xmath6 which",
    "is implied that @xmath50 . here",
    ", we denote the eigenvalues of a matrix @xmath5 or @xmath6 as @xmath51 and their corresponding eigenvectors @xmath48 . after merging",
    ", the new node will carry the sum of the edges of nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the resulting adjacency matrix of a bipartite network @xmath52 will have order @xmath53 or @xmath54 , with the corresponding line or column of the new node being the sum of the line ( column ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the properties of random walk in the new bipartite network is exactly the same as those in the original network .",
    "moreover , if @xmath55 we could also group them in order to obtain an even smaller bipartite network . by definition , if @xmath56 we could group node @xmath10 and @xmath11 together . like ref .",
    "@xcite , the condition @xmath56 can be implemented by defining a parameter @xmath57 as equally distributed intervals between the minimize and the maximum components of each eigenvector @xmath20 .",
    "the nodes whose eigenvector components in @xmath20 fall in the same interval should be grouped .",
    "we summarize the bipartite network spectral coarse graining ( bscg ) method in the following procedures :    1 .",
    "for any given bipartite network * a * , we can get two stochastic matrices @xmath40 and @xmath42 which gives the transition probability from the top nodes to bottom nodes and bottoms nodes to top nodes in bipartite network , respectively ; 2 .   using @xmath40 and @xmath42",
    ", we can obtain two square stochastic matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "3 .   calculating the eigenvalues @xmath51 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath48 of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; 4 .   merging nodes with similar components in the @xmath48 as one node .",
    "in the new adjacency matrix @xmath52 , this node will carry the sum of the edges of original nodes .",
    "the nodes in the top set should be merged based on the eigenvectors of @xmath5 and the nodes in the bottom set should be merged based on the eigenvectors of @xmath6 .",
    "the obtained adjacency matrix @xmath58 is a weighted matrix .",
    "the new stochastic matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be calculated as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this method can be further extended to more than one eigenvector . in this case , groups are defined as nodes with almost the same component over the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest nontrivial eigenvalues .",
    "actually , choosing several largest nontrivial eigenvalues could better preserve the properties of random walk in bipartite network .",
    "to validate the new method , we apply it to both artificial and real - world bipartite networks .      to begin with ,",
    "let us consider an artificial bipartite networks with 1200 vertices , which are divided into 2 sets .",
    "the top set has 300 vertices and the bottom set has 900 vertices , and nodes in each set are divided into 10 groups with equal size . in other words ,",
    "each group in the top set has 30 vertices while there are 90 vertices in each group of the bottom set .",
    "the probability for existing a link between each pair of nodes in the same group is @xmath63 while @xmath64 is the corresponding probability outside the group . in this section , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "since this kind of artificial networks have significant community structure , we call them community networks . using the clustering method in original bipartite network  @xcite ,",
    "10 communities are correctly detected from the network .    to coarse grain this bipartite network",
    ", we used the largest three nontrivial eigenvectors @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we set @xmath70 , which means that 12 intervals with equal size are divided between the largest and the lowest component of each eigenvector . using the bscg method",
    ", we get a rather small network with 391 vertices . clearly , since the bscg method and community detection method focus on different properties in the bipartite network , the nodes grouping results are different .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the three largest nontrivial eigenvalues of @xmath5 and @xmath6 before and after the coarse graining .",
    "though the largest nontrivial eigenvalues of these two matrices are the same , note that the matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 contain different information .",
    "specifically , @xmath5 is with order @xmath71 and describes the probability that the walker is from the top set to the top set , while @xmath6 considers the information that the walker is from the bottom set to the bottom set .",
    "moreover , the eigenvectors of the largest nontrivial eigenvalues of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively corresponding to the nodes in the top set and bottom set .",
    "thus , the eigenvectors of both matrices should be considered and the nontrivial eigenvalues of both matrices should be preserved .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the reduced network can be calculated from the reduced adjacency matrix @xmath58 , using the same way described in the previous section .",
    "as expected from our perturbative derivation , the largest three eigenvalues are effectively preserved in the coarse - grained network .",
    "moreover , we also apply the bscg method to er random bipartite networks and obtain similar results ( see also table  [ table1 ] ) . in the er random bipartite networks ,",
    "the probability of having a link between two vertices of different sets is @xmath74 and the top set contains 1000 vertices while bottom set has 800 vertices . in the er bipartite network , we also focus on the three largest nontrivial eigenvectors and set @xmath75 .",
    "the results in table  [ table1 ] indicates that our new method is robust in various kinds of artificial networks .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        +       in this subsection , we apply our method to some real - world networks .",
    "first , we apply the method to a social network of terrorists and the data was collected from 430 websites .",
    "the network was sampled from the data collected over a period from oct .",
    "1st , 1949 to may 1st , 2012 , and it was based on the relationship between terrorists and their organizations . in this small social network ,",
    "we focus on the giant component which are composed of 73 nodes in total , including 20 organizations and 53 people .",
    "the structure of the original network can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , where the blue square accounts for the people and the red circle represents the organizations .",
    "the links between a person and an organization indicates that the person belongs to the organization . to coarse grain this network",
    ", we set @xmath77 and obtain a reduced network with 23 nodes , which is shown in the bottom figure in fig .",
    "the three largest nontrivial eigenvalues before and after coarse graining are shown in table [ table2 ] .",
    "clearly , all these eigenvalues are well preserved .",
    "using our new method , the resulting network is also a bipartite network .",
    "furthermore , we also try the method introduced in  @xcite on this real - world network , the resulting network is a binary one and the original two different kinds of nodes are indistinguishable .    as a further step ,",
    "we apply our method to two online commercial networks : movielens and netflix .",
    "the movielens network was sampled from the data collected over a seven - month period from september 19th , 1997 through april 22nd , 1998 .",
    "the data consisted of 100,000 movie ratings from 943 users on 1,682 items .",
    "each user sampled had rated at least 20 items .",
    "users can vote for movies with five level ratings from 1 ( i.e. , worst ) to 5 ( i.e. , best ) . here",
    "we only consider the ratings higher than 2 , so the data contains 82,520 user - object pairs .",
    "this sampled data is freely available at  @xcite .",
    "the netflix network was randomly sampled from the huge data set provided for the netflix prize .",
    "the original data is freely available at  @xcite .",

    ", we only consider a subset of this huge data set .",
    "the subset consists of 3,000 users , 2,779 movies , and 824,802 links .",
    "similar to the movielens data , only the links with ratings no less than 3 are considered .",
    "after data filtering , there are 197,428 links left in the netflix network .",

    "finally , we remark that the results in fig . 3 is consistent in different choices of sinks .",
    "no matter the walker starts and ends at nodes in the same or different set of nodes , the mfpt of the reduced network from bscg method well overlaps with that of the original network . taken together ,",
    "the bscg method is very robust in its performance .",
    "one of the most difficult hurdles in the analysis of complex network is the huge size of the real - world systems .",

    "are proposed , which mainly focus on the one - mode network in which only one type of nodes exist .    in this paper , we proposed a new coarse grain method for bipartite network with respect to random walk . after introducing two square stochastic matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we find that their three largest nontrivial eigenvalues can effectively represent the properties of random walk .",
    "to merge node with similar components of these eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues , the reduced network with well preserved eigenvalues of stochastic matrix is obtained . moreover , a straight test based on the mean first passage time is carried out in two real - world bipartite networks , and this property is well preserved in the reduced bipartite network .",
    "we believe that this method can be easily extend to preserve many other of spectral - determined dynamical properties in bipartite networks .",
    "moreover , we have shown that for a bipartite network that the coarse graining provides a highly representative approximation of the initial network , giving rise to a way to circumvent the large size of complex networks for their analysis and visualization .    finally , from a computational point of view",
    ", the first eigenvectors are fast to calculate with the existing optimized methods for sparse matrices , including the lanczos and ql algorithms .",

    "<S> indicates that our coarse graining scheme could obtain much smaller networks from large ones , keeping most of the relevant spectral properties . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we further validate the coarse graining method by directly comparing the mean first passage time between the original network and the reduced one . </S>"
