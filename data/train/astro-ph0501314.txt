    "( 1999 ) lf measurements at bright magnitudes , @xmath9@xmath1225.5 . as in steidel",
    "( 1999 ) , our lf calculation uses the effective volume technique , calculating @xmath13 using recovery tests of artificial high-@xmath3 galaxies implanted into the imaging data .",
    "we do not present the results for @xmath3@xmath41.7 here because that analysis is still ongoing as the narrow selection window in the @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 color makes it necessary to carry out a more sophisticated treatment of completeness and effective volume at @xmath3@xmath41.7 than in the higher redshift bins .",
    "our data reach down to very faint luminosities which correspond to star formation rates ( not adjusted for dust ) of only 12  @xmath17/yr ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "as fig .  2 shows , we find a factor of @xmath43 evolution in the number counts ( or , alternatively , 2 mag in luminosity ) of _ faint _ lyman break galaxies from @xmath3@xmath44 to @xmath3@xmath43 while at the same time , there is no evidence for evolution from @xmath3@xmath44 to @xmath3@xmath43 at the _ bright _ end ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; and fig .  2 ) .",
    "thus , it seems that the luminosity function of high-@xmath3 galaxies evolves in a _ differential _ way , suggesting that different mechanisms drive the evolution of the faint and of the luminous galaxies .",
    "it is unlikely that the observed evolution is due to a selection bias because ( 1 ) if it were , we would expect the deficit to be present at bright _ and _ faint magnitudes , and ( 2 ) to make up the deficit would require an unreasonably enormous expansion of the @xmath3@xmath44 color selection box ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the the evolution from @xmath3@xmath44 to @xmath3@xmath43 is likely a reflection of a true differential , luminosity - dependent evolutionary effect . at the same time , we see no evidence for evolution at the the faint end from @xmath3@xmath43 to @xmath3@xmath42.2 ( the bright end remains unconstrained at present ) suggesting that the mechanism responsible for the evolution at earlier epochs saturates at lower redshifts .",
    "at present , it is not clear what is responsible for the observed differential evolution of the lf .",
    "one straightforward possibility is that the number of faint ( but not bright ) lbgs simply increases over the 500  myr from @xmath3@xmath44 to @xmath3@xmath43 ( but not beyond ) .",
    "another possibility is that dust properties  its amount or covering fraction  may be decreasing in faint lbgs thus making them brighter . alternatively ,",
    "if star formation in individual faint lbgs is time - variable , then they may brighten and fade ( and thus move in and out of a given magnitude bin in the lf ) with duty cycle properties that change with redshift . however , whichever mechanism is responsible , it appears to saturate by @xmath3@xmath42.2 .",
    "the fact that the lf evolution appears to be differential suggests that different evolutionary mechanisms are at play as a function of uv luminosity .",
    "studies that _ differentially _ compare key galaxy properties as a function of luminosity and redshift should help us isolate the mechanisms that are responsible for this evolution .",
    "for example : ( 1 ) the kdf is designed to measure galaxy clustering as a function of both luminosity and redshift and doing so will let us relate the potentially time - varying uv luminosity to the more stable dark matter halo mass . ( 2 ) we will also use a high - quality @xmath41000-hour 80-object _ composite _ spectrum of a faint @xmath3@xmath43 lbg ( gemini gmos observations are underway ) to compare key diagnostics of dust , superwinds , and stellar populations in a faint and a luminous ( e.g. , shapley et al .  2003 ) composite lbg .",
    "( 3 ) broadband rest - frame uv - optical colors constrain the stellar population age and the amount of dust in lbgs ( e.g. , sawicki et al .  1998 ; papovich et al .",
    "2001 ) and we can use this approach to look for systematic differences in age and dust content .",
    "significantly , all such studies will be making _ differential _",
    "comparisons , thereby reducing our exposure to systematic biases in models or low-@xmath3 analogs .",
    "a key point is that we have identified luminosity and redshift as important variables in galaxy evolution at high @xmath3 .",
    "while lbg follow - up studies to date have primarily focused on luminous galaxies at @xmath3@xmath43 , extending such studies as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath6 should yield valuable insights into how galaxies form and evolve : studying how key diagnostic properties of high-@xmath3 galaxies vary with @xmath6 and @xmath3 will help us constrain what mechanisms drive galaxy evolution in the early universe ."
