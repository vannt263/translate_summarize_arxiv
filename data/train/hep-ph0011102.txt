    "in recent times brans - dicke(bd ) gravity with matter in the einstein frame attracted much attention .",
    "especially , such theories have been realized as einstein gravity with dilaton coupled to matter ( for a review of the renewed interest in scalar ",
    "tensor gravity see ref .",
    "obviously , brans - dicke theory @xcite represents one of the simplest examples of scalar  tensor ( or dilatonic ) gravities where the background is described by the metric and the dilaton .",
    "the reason for the consideration of such models is the following : + first of all , the dilaton is an essential element of string theories , and the low ",
    "energy string effective action may be considered as some kind of bd theory with higher order terms ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "second , dimensional reduction of kaluza - klein theories naturally may lead to bd gravity .",
    "third , dilatonic gravity is expected to have such important cosmological applications as , e.g. , in the case of ( hyper)extended inflation @xcite .",
    "in addition , there was some activity on the study of bd cosmologies with varying speed of light @xcite .",
    "recently , the anomaly - induced action for dilaton coupled scalars , vectors and spinors in four dimensional curved spacetime has been calculated in ref .",
    "thereafter , in @xcite , the effective action formalism has been applied for a study of quantum cosmology in bd gravity with dilaton coupled spinors . there , the one - loop anomaly  induced effective action ( ea ) due to @xmath0 massless fermions on a time - dependent conformally flat background coupled to the dilaton has been computed and the ( fourth - order ) quantum  corrected equations of motion have been derived . however , because of the complicated structure of that coupled set of ( ordinary ) differential equations only one special solution , representing an inflationary universe with slowly expanding bd dilaton , could be presented .    here , we study the equations of motion , for conformal as well as physical time , more extensively . we were able to show additional particular , physically relevant solutions .",
    "making use of the symmetry group analysis we showed that the former solution is a special case of the `` stationary solution '' of the set of five first - order differential equations being equivalent to the equations of motion . by a numerical analysis the asymptotic behaviour of various solutions will be shown ; some of them approximate the stationary solution .",
    "for the non - stationary solutions a perturbative analysis has been done and some new solutions corresponding to terminating series are presented . finally , a stability analysis of the equations of motion is given .",

    "this will be presented in the next section .",
    "also the condition of structural stability is of great importance ; it will be considered in detail in the last section .",
    "in the input equations one can exchange the independent variable @xmath67 and any of the dependent variables .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath128 as new independent variable we can rewrite equations ( [ input ] ) in the following form @xmath129    instead of choosing @xmath128 as new independent variable we can also choose any other dependent variable , for example @xmath108 .",
    "this case is of particular interest because , for @xmath130 , there exists the stationary solution ( [ stationary1 ] ) of the basic equations ( [ input ] ) .",
    "therefore when @xmath131 we will get the time - dependent solution according with the first of the following equations @xmath132    in view of the polynomial dependencies of ( [ inputu ] ) and ( [ inputq ] ) upon @xmath128 and @xmath108 it is possible to look for solutions in form of an infinite series in these variables .      * ( a ) * let us start with the particular case @xmath43 .",

    "below we present two examples of such solutions .    *",
    "( a1 ) *  the first example is valid for @xmath140 and @xmath141 and is given by the formulas @xmath142 this solution confirms that different types of behavior of solutions are possible depending upon the initial conditions .",
    "for @xmath143 we have transition to the stationary state with zero asymptotic values of @xmath128 and @xmath107 at @xmath144 , while for @xmath145 we have an explosion  type behavior whose singularity lies at @xmath146 .",
    "the scalar curvature is positive and , in the limit @xmath101 , approaches @xmath147 .",
    "the solution described by formulas ( [ out1a ] ) is valid for @xmath148 and corresponds to @xmath149 .",
    "however , in this case a more general form of the behavior of functions @xmath108 and @xmath67 upon @xmath128 ( as compared to ( [ out1a ] ) ) can be obtained that is given as follows ( @xmath150 ) : @xmath151 the result of the previous case ( [ out1a ] ) arises if we impose the restriction @xmath152 that leads to constant values of @xmath153 .    obviously , as long as @xmath149 these solutions are quite special since they correspond to a constant dilaton .",
    "furthermore , because of @xmath149 the solution does not depend on @xmath154 ( and @xmath4 ) !    * ( a2 ) *  the second example is valid for @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and is given by the formulas @xmath157    this solution may be obtained also directly from eqs .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) where we used the conformal time @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , putting @xmath43 in ( [ b1 ] ) and substituting into ( [ conftime ] ) we get @xmath158 which is easily integrated as @xmath159 making use of the definition of @xmath160 we get , after differentiation of ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) , the following relation between @xmath128 and @xmath161 : @xmath162 eliminating @xmath108 with the help of the last formula from the expression for @xmath67 we get @xmath163 which coincides with ( [ out1b ] ) if we take into account @xmath164 . the rest of eqs .  ( [ out1b ] ) may be checked immediately .    in the limit",
    "@xmath165 the last formula gives @xmath166 ; in the opposite limit @xmath167 we have @xmath168 .    even in the case of @xmath169 , when we can hardly find the analytical dependence of @xmath67 upon @xmath9 , the use of the formula ( [ conftime ] ) can help to find the dependence of @xmath67 upon @xmath9 by quadratures : @xmath170 and formulas ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) have the form @xmath171    the behavior of @xmath161 and @xmath28 upon @xmath67 , resulting from eqs .",
