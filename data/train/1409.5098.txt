    "quantum mechanics , our standard model of the physical world at the smallest scales of energy and size , has built - in retrocausal aspects .",
    "for example , wheeler s delayed choice _ _",
    "gedankenexperiment__@xcite describes a scheme in which the experimenter s later choice of measurement retroactively determines whether a light photon that had previously encountered a two - slit aperture had passed through both slits or through only one slit .    in the present work",
    "we describe a new quantum - mechanical paradox in which the presence or absence of an interference pattern in a path - entangled two photon system with variable entanglement , controlled by measurement choice , would seem to permit retrocausal signaling from one observer to another .",
    "we also present an analysis of this scheme , showing how the subtleties of the quantum formalism block the potential signal .",
    "in particular , even when interference patterns can be switched off and on , there is always a  signal \" interference pattern and an  anti - signal \" interference pattern that mask any observable interference when they are added , even when entanglement and coherence are simultaneously present .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to what in the literature has been called  the complementarity of one- and two - particle interference\"@xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics differs from the classical mechanics of newton that preceded it in one very important way .",
    "newtonian systems are always _",
    "local_. if a newtonian system breaks up , each of its parts receives a definite and well - defined energy , momentum , and angular momentum , parceled out at breakup by the system while respecting the conservation laws .",
    "after the component subsystems are separated , the properties of each subsystem are completely independent and do not depend on those of the other subsystems .",
    "on the other hand , quantum mechanics is _ nonlocal _ , meaning that the component parts of a quantum system may continue to influence each other , even when they are well separated in space and out of speed - of - light contact .",
    "this unexpected characteristic of standard quantum theory was first pointed out by albert einstein and his colleagues boris podolsky and nathan rosen ( epr ) in 1935 , in a critical paper@xcite in which they held up the discovered nonlocality as a devastating flaw that , it was claimed , demonstrated that the standard quantum formalism must be incomplete or wrong .",
    "einstein called nonlocality ",
    "spooky actions at a distance \" .",
    "schrdinger followed on the discovery of quantum nonlocality by showing in detail how the components of a multi - part quantum system must depend on each other , even when they are well separated@xcite .",
    "beginning in 1972 with the work of stuart freedman and john clauser@xcite , a series of quantum - optics epr experiments testing bell - inequality violations@xcite and other aspects of linked quantum systems were performed .",
    "these experimental results can be taken as demonstrating that , like it or not , both quantum mechanics and the reality it describes are intrinsically nonlocal .",
    "einstein s spooky actions - at - a - distance are really out there in the physical world , whether we understand and accept them or not .",
    "how and why is quantum mechanics nonlocal ?",
    "nonlocality comes from two seemingly conflicting aspects of the quantum formalism : ( 1 ) energy , momentum , and angular momentum , important properties of light and matter , are conserved in all quantum systems , in the sense that , in the absence of external forces and torques , their net values must remain unchanged as the system evolves , while ( 2 ) in the wave functions describing quantum systems , as required by the uncertainty principle , the conserved quantities are often indefinite and unspecified and typically can span a large range of possible values .",
    "this non - specificity persists until a measurement is made that  collapses \" the wave function and fixes the measured quantities with specific values",
    ". these seemingly inconsistent requirements of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) raise an important question : how can the wave functions describing the separated members of a system of particles , which may be light - years apart , have arbitrary and unspecified values for the conserved quantities and yet respect the conservation laws when the wave functions are collapsed ?",
    "this paradox is accommodated in the formalism of quantum mechanics because the quantum wave functions of particles are _ entangled _ , the term coined by schrdinger to mean that even when the wave functions describe system parts that are spatially separated and out of light - speed contact , the separate wave functions continue to depend on each other and can not be separately specified . in particular , the conserved quantities in the system s parts ( even though individually indefinite ) must always add up to the values possessed by the overall quantum system before it separated into parts",
    ".    how could this entanglement and preservation of conservation laws possibly be arranged by nature ?",
    "the mathematics of quantum mechanics gives us no answers to this question , it only insists that the wave functions of separated parts of a quantum system do depend on each other .",
    "theorists prone to abstraction have found it convenient to abandon the three - dimensional universe and describe such quantum systems as residing in a many - dimensional hilbert hyper - space in which the conserved variables form extra dimensions and in which the interconnections between particle wave functions are represented as allowed sub - regions of the overall hyper - space .",
    "that has led to elegant mathematics , but it provides little assistance in visualizing what is really going on in the physical world .",
    "in this paper , for reasons of space and focus , we will not attempt to account for nonlocality by considering any interpretation of quantum mechanics . we will simply note that the transactional interpretation@xcite of quantum mechanics , introduced by one of the authors in 1986 , seems to be unique among the plethora of interpretations of the quantum formalism in providing a definite mechanism that accounts for nonlocality and facilitates visualization of nonlocal processes . here",
    "we will take the existence of quantum nonlocality and entanglement as established facts and consider their implications .",
    "given that a measurement on one part of an extended quantum system can affect the outcomes of measurements performed in other distant parts of the system , the question that naturally arises is : _ can this phenomenon be used for nonlocal communication between one observer and another ?",
    "_ demonstration of such nonlocal quantum communication would be a truly  game - changing \" discovery , because it would break all the rules of normal communication .",
    "no energy would pass between the send and receive stations ; the acts of sending and receiving could occur in either time order and would depend only on the chosen instants at which the measurements were made ; there would be no definite signal - propagation speed , and messages could effectively be sent faster than light - speed , or  instantaneously \" in any chosen reference frame , or even , in principle , backwards in time .",
    "the average member of the physics community , if he or she has any opinion about nonlocal communication at all , believes it to be impossible , in part because of its superluminal and retrocausal implications . over the years a number of authors have presented proofs , based on the standard quantum formalism , showing that nonlocal observer - to - observer communication is impossible@xcite .",
    "they employ details of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory and show that in separated measurements involving entangled quantum systems , the quantum correlations will be preserved but there will be no effect apparent to an observer in one sub - system if the character of the measurement is changed in the other sub - system .",
    "thus , the standard quantum formalism implies that nonlocal signaling is impossible , and any hypothetical observation of nonlocal signaling would require some change in that formalism .    nevertheless , it is interesting to observe in specific seemingly paradoxical cases ( see below ) exactly how the nonlocal signal is blocked .",
    "we note that one plausible mechanism for blocking nonlocal signals is the known  complementary \" or see - saw relation between entanglement and coherence@xcite .",
    "since some degree of _ both _ coherence and entanglement would be required for any potential nonlocal signal@xcite , it is particularly interesting to study systems in which the entanglement / coherence ratio is a parameter that can be varied so that both are simultaneously present ( see below ) , as would be reqired for an interference  signal \" .",
    "+ we note that it is also sometimes asserted that nonlocal communication is not possible because it would conflict with special relativity .",
    "this assertion is incorrect .",
    "the prohibition of signals with superluminal speeds by einstein s theory of special relativity is related to the fact that a condition of definite simultaneity between two separated space - time points is not lorenz invariant . assuming that some hypothetical superluminal signal could be used to establish a fixed simultaneity relation between two such points , e.g. , by clock synchronization",
    ", this would imply a preferred inertial frame and would be inconsistent with lorenz invariance and special relativity .",
    "in other words , superluminal signaling would be inconsistent with the even - handed treatment of all inertial reference frames that is the basis of special relativity .",
    "however , if a nonlocal signal could be transmitted through measurements at separated locations performed on two entangled photons , the signal would be  sent \" at the time of the arrival of one photon at one location and  received \" at the time of arrival of the other photon at the other location , both along lorenz - invariant light - like world lines . by varying path lengths to the two locations",
    ", these events could be made to occur in any order and time separation in any reference frame .",
    "therefore , nonlocal signals ( even superluminal and retrocausal ones ) could not be used to establish a fixed simultaneity relation between two separated space - time points , because the sending and receiving of such signals do not have fixed time relations .",
    "nonlocal quantum signaling , if it were to exist , would be completely compatible with special relativity .",
    "( however , it would probably _ not _ be compatible with macroscopic causality . )",
    "first , let us examine a fairly simple epr experiment exhibiting nonlocality .",
    "following bell@xcite , a number of experimental epr tests@xcite have exploited the correlations of polarization - entangled systems that arise from angular momentum conservation .",
    "their results , to accuracies of many standard deviations , are consistent with the predictions of standard quantum mechanics and can be interpreted as falsifying many local hidden - variable alternatives to quantum mechanics .        a modern version of this type of epr experiment , one in which the entanglement / coherence ratio is an adjustable parameter , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we note that while there are many analyses of such experiments in the literature , there is no previous analysis for a system with variable entanglement .",
    "two observers , alice and bob , operate polarimeters measuring the linear polarization ( h or v ) of individual photons and record photon detections .",
    "the h - v plane of alice s polarimeter can be rotated through an angle @xmath0 with respect to the plane of bob s polarimeter , so that the basis of her polarization measurements can be changed relative to bob s .    here",
    "the source of photons is taken to be a sagnac entangled two - photon source of the type developed by the zeilinger group@xcite , in which the degree of entanglement can be varied by rotating a half - wave plate in the system , as characterized by the variable @xmath1 , producing a two - particle wave function of the general form : + @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "the degree of photon - pair entanglement from this source is adjustable .",
    "when @xmath4 , the two - photon polarization entanglement is 100% in a pure bell state with the wave function @xmath5 ; when @xmath6 the entanglement is 0 in a non - entangled product state with @xmath7/2 $ ] ; when @xmath8 the source will produce photon pairs with 71% entanglement and 71% coherence .",
    "for the four detector combinations with : @xmath4 ( red / solid , 100% entangled ) , @xmath8 ( green / dashed , 71% entangled ) , and @xmath6 ( blue / dot - dashed , 0% entangled),width=15 ]    let us assume that we initially set @xmath4 for 100% entanglement .",
    "when @xmath0 is zero and the polarimeters are aligned , there will be a perfect anti - correlation between the polarizations measured by alice and by bob . the random polarization ( h or v ) that alice measures will always be the opposite of that measured by bob ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , when @xmath0 is increased , the perfect @xmath9 and @xmath10 anti - correlations are degraded and correlated detections @xmath11 and @xmath12 , previously not present , will begin to appear .",
    "local theories require that for small @xmath0 rotations this correlation degradation should increase linearly with @xmath0 , while quantum mechanics predicts that it should increase as @xmath13 , i.e. , quadratically@xcite .",
    "this is the basis of bell s inequalities@xcite , counting ratio inequalities that are valid for linear behavior in @xmath0 but are dramatically violated for the quadratic behavior characteristic of quantum mechanics .",
    "the quantum mechanical analysis of this system is fairly simple because , assuming that the entangled photons have a single spatial mode , their transport through the system can be described by considering only the phase shifts and polarization selections that the system elements create in the waves .",
    "we have used the formalism of horne , shimony and zeilinger@xcite to perform such an analysis and to calculate the joint wave functions for simultaneous detections at both detectors@xcite .",
    "these are : @xmath14/\\sqrt{2}\\\\      \\psi_{hv}(\\alpha,\\theta ) = [ -\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\theta)+i\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\theta)]/\\sqrt{2}\\\\      \\psi_{vh}(\\alpha,\\theta ) = [ \\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\theta)-i\\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\theta)]/\\sqrt{2}\\\\      \\psi_{vv}(\\alpha,\\theta ) = [ \\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\theta)-i\\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\theta)]/\\sqrt{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding joint detection probabilities are : @xmath15/4\\\\          p_{hv}(\\alpha,\\theta ) = [ 1 + \\cos(2\\alpha)\\cos(2\\theta)]/4\\\\      p_{vh}(\\alpha,\\theta ) = [ 1 + \\cos(2\\alpha)\\cos(2\\theta)]/4\\\\      p_{vv}(\\alpha,\\theta ) = [ 1 - \\cos(2\\alpha)\\cos(2\\theta)]/4.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows plots of these joint detection probabilities vs. @xmath0 for the four detector combinations with : @xmath4 ( 100% entangled ) , @xmath8 ( 71% entangled ) , and @xmath6 ( 0% entangled ) .",
    "now consider the question of whether , at any setting of @xmath1 , observer alice by operating the left system and varying @xmath0 can send a nonlocal signal to observer bob operating the right system .",
    "some overall observer who is monitoring the coincidence counting rates @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 could reproduce fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and would have a clear indication of when @xmath0 was varied by alice , in that the relative rates would change dramatically .",
    "however , observer bob is isolated at the system on the right and is monitoring only the two singles counting rates @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    bob would observe the probabilities @xmath18 and @xmath19 , both independent of the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , bob would see only counts detected at random in one or the other of his detectors with a 50% chance of each polarization , and his observed rates would not be affected by the setting of @xmath0 .",
    "alice s choice of her @xmath0 setting will alter the wave functions that arrive at bob s detectors , but not in a way that permits signaling .",
    "schrdinger called this effect  steering \" the wave functions@xcite .",
    "the late heinz pagels , in his book _ _ the cosmic code__@xcite , examined in great detail the way in which the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanics blocks any potential nonlocal signal in this type of polarization - based epr experiment .",
    "we emphasize the point that linear polarization is an interference effect of the photon s intrinsic circularly - polarized spin angular momentum @xmath20 , @xmath21 helicity eigenstates .",
    "as we will see below , the interference blocking observed here is an example of a  signal \" interference pattern and an  anti - signal \" interference pattern that mask any observable interference when they are added , even when entanglement and coherence are simultaneously present .",
    "this behavior is attributed to what has been called the complementarity of one - particle and two - particle interference@xcite .",
    "although the entanglement of linear polarization is a very convenient medium for epr experiments and bell - inequality tests , in many ways the alternative offered by path - entangled epr experiments provides a richer venue .",
    "perhaps the earliest example of a path - entangled epr experiment is the 1995  ghost interference \" experiment of the shih group at university of maryland baltimore county@xcite .",
    "their experiment demonstrated that an interference pattern observed for one member of a pair of entangled photons could be  switched \" off or on depending on whether the other photon of the pair went through one slit or both slits of a two - slit aperture .",
    "another path - entangled epr experiment was the 1999 phd thesis of dr .",
    "birgit dopfer at the university of innsbruck@xcite , performed under the direction of prof .",
    "anton zeilinger .",
    "this experiment demonstrated that one could can make the interference pattern observed for one of a pair of entangled photons appear or disappear , depending on whether the location of the detector that detected the other member of the entangled pair was at or away from the focal point of a lens .",
    "examination of the ghost - interference and dopfer experiments raises a very interesting question : can the requirement of a coincidence between the entangled photons , used in both experiments , be removed ?",
    "the answer to this question is subtle . in principle , the two entangled photons are connected by nonlocality whether they are detected in coincidence or not , so the coincidence may perhaps be removable .",
    "however , in both experiments the authors reported that no two - slit interference distribution was observed when the coincidence requirement was removed .",
    "these considerations lead to a new quantum mechanical paradox : they suggest@xcite that if the coincidence requirement could be relaxed , nonlocal observer - to - observer signals might be transmitted by controlling the presence or absence of an interference pattern , essentially by forcing wave - like or particle - like behavior on both members of an entangled photon pair .    from the point of view of moving to a path - entanglement situation in which the coincidence requirement could be relaxed ,",
    "the problem with both of the experiments discussed above is their use of a two - slit system that blocks and absorbs most of the photons from the nonlinear crystal that illuminate the slit system .",
    "the down - conversion process is intrinsically very inefficient ( @xmath221 photon pair per @xmath23 pump photons ) , so there are no photons to waste .",
    "an additional complication is that most detectors capable of detecting individual photons are intrinsically noisy and somewhat inefficient . for these reasons ,",
    "there is a large advantage in using _ all _ of the available entangled - photon pairs in any contemplated path - interference test of nonlocal communication .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows a path - entangled experimental epr test using two mach - zehnder interferometers@xcite that have been modified to convert polarization entanglement to path entanglement@xcite .",
    "this type of system was originally developed by the zeilinger group at the institute for quantum optics and quantum information , vienna@xcite . here , the interferometers are a variant of the basic mach - zehnder design that uses an initial polarizing beam splitter ( @xmath24 ) that directs the vertical ( @xmath25 ) and horizontal ( @xmath26 ) linear polarizations to different paths and then converts horizontal to vertical polarization on the upper path with a half - wave plate ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this has the effect of converting polarization entanglement from the source to path entanglement and then placing waves on both paths in the same polarization state , so that they can interfere .",
    "again observers alice and bob operate the interferometers and count and record individual photon detections . a phase shift element ( @xmath28 )",
    "allows the observers to alter the phase of waves on the upper paths .    as in the polarization - entangled epr example",
    ", the source of photons is taken to be the sagnac entangled two - photon source developed by the zeilinger group@xcite , in which the degree of entanglement depends on the value of @xmath1 in this setup . following the path separation",
    "the extended two - particle wave function has the general form : + @xmath29 where @xmath3 . when @xmath30 , the two - photon wave function is a fully path - entangled bell state of the form @xmath31 , and when @xmath6 the path entanglement is 0 and the wave function is a product state of the form @xmath32 .",
    "alice s last beam - splitter ( @xmath33 ) is removable .",
    "when @xmath33 is in place , the two left paths are remixed , the left - going photons exhibit the wave - like behavior of being on both paths , and two - path overlap and mach - zehnder interference will be present .",
    "when @xmath34 is removed , path detection occurs , the left - going photons exhibit the particle - like behavior of being on a path uniquely ending at detector @xmath35 or at detector @xmath36 , so that alice s measurements provide which - way information about both photons .",
    "bob s last beam splitter ( @xmath37 ) remains in place and , in the absence of which - way information , should exhibit mach - zehnder interference .",
    "this experiment is thus the equivalent of the ghost - interference experiment and the dopfer experiment described above , in that it embodies entangled paths and two - path interference .",
    "however , it improves on those experiments by using all of the available entangled photons and by employing a source that has a variable entanglement that depends on @xmath1 .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that this situation presents a nonlocal signaling paradox , in that alice . by choosing whether @xmath33 is in or out ,",
    "can cause the mach - zehnder interference effect to be present or absent in bob s detectors .",

    "with @xmath33 in we expect wave - like behavior , and bob , for the proper choice of @xmath40 , should observe all counts in @xmath38 and no counts in @xmath39 due to mach - zehnder interference .",
    "it was further argued@xcite that possibly the nonlocal signal might be suppressed by the complementarity of entanglement and coherence@xcite , and that by arranging for 71% entanglement and 71% coherence ( i.e. , @xmath8 for the sagnac source ) , a nonlocal signal might be permitted .",

    "unitarity ( or equivalently , energy conservation ) requires that any wave - mixing device that produces destructive interference in some locations must produce a precisely equal amount of constructive interference in other locations .",
    "the @xmath50 wedge beam - combiner is no exception .",
    "the flaw in such cancellation arguments is that in the previous examples we have always dealt with configurations in which only a single spatial mode of the photon is present . in such cases",
    ", superposition can be used without considering wave trajectories , since the wave front for any given path arrives at a detector with a constant overall phase . in the present configuration ,",
    "the spatial profiles of the waves on alice s two paths are truncated at the apex of the wedge mirror , producing non - gaussian spatial modes , and also must propagate in slightly different directions in order to overlap at the detector so they are definitely in different spatial modes .",
    "therefore , the phase of arriving waves is not constant and will depend on the location on the detector face .",
    "consequently , simple one - mode position - independent superposition can not be used .    instead ,",
    "in order to calculate the differential probability of detection at a specific location on the face of detector @xmath57 , one must propagate the waves from the wedge to the detector by doing a path integral of huygens wavelets originating across the effective aperture of the wedge . to get the overall detection probability , one must then integrate over locations on the detector face . and since there are two quantum - distinguishable amplitudes arriving at the detector face , these must be converted to probabilities separately and then added .",
    "the analysis of the wedge system is therefore much more challenging that those of the previous examples .",
    "while analytic expressions can be obtained for the differential probability of two - particle detection with one of bob s detectors and at some specific lateral position on @xmath57 , the integration of that differential probability , a highly oscillatory function , over the face of @xmath57 can not be done analytically .",
    "thus the analysis can not produce equations predicting bob s singles counts that can be directly compared with eqns .",
    "[ eq : b1 ] and [ eq : b0 ] for the signal test .",
    "instead one must subtract the results of numerical integration from evaluations of eqns .",
    "[ eq : b1 ] and [ eq : b0 ] using the same values for @xmath1 , @xmath44 , and @xmath58 used in the numerical integration , and observe how close to zero is the calculated difference ( which represents the potential nonlocal signal ) .",
    "we have performed this analysis@xcite of the experiment shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , tweaking the mirror angles for maximum overlap of the waves on the two paths to detector @xmath54 .",
    "the calculation gives large analytical expressions for joint detection probability as a function of position on detector @xmath54 , but these must be integrated numerically to obtain the position - independent probabilities .",
    "[ fig:6 ] shows the overlap of the magnitudes of the wave functions for paths @xmath59 and @xmath60 vs. position .",
    "the wave functions have a basic gaussian profile with oscillations arising from the truncation of one gaussian tail by @xmath55 .",
    "( red / solid ) and @xmath61 ( blue / dotted ) as functions of position @xmath62 on the face of detector @xmath54 .",
    "oscillations are the result of gaussian tail truncation by the apex of wedge mirror @xmath55 .",
    ", width=15 ]     and @xmath63 ( red / solid ) and at @xmath54 and @xmath39 ( blue / dotted ) with @xmath4 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    ", width=15 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows the corresponding probabilities for @xmath4 ( e.g. , fully entangled ) of coincident photon pairs at alice s detector @xmath57 and at bob s detectors @xmath63 and @xmath66 .",
    "the probabilities are highly oscillatory because of the interference of the two waves and the phase walk of the wave functions with angle , analogous to two - slit interference .    to test the possibility of a nonlocal signal",
    ", we must integrate these probabilities over the extent of the detector face and calculate difference functions from these results and similar evaluations of eqns .",
    "[ eq : b1 ] and [ eq : b0 ] .",
    "we can expect some errors in numerical integration due to the oscillation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "the difference functions as 2-d contour plots in @xmath58 vs. @xmath1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .     and [ eq : b0 ] . here",
    "the regions labeled  * a * \" reach minima of @xmath67 , the regions labeled  * b * \" reach maxima of @xmath68 , and the regions labeled  * c * \" reach maxima of @xmath69 . small blotches indicate regions in which numerical integration has produced errors .",
    ", width=15 ]    thus , the differences between the probabilities predicted by of eqns .",
    "[ eq : b1 ] and [ eq : b0 ] and the numerically - integrated probabilities of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] are on the order of a few parts per million .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that they are the same , and that no nonlocal signal is possible using the wedge - modified configuration of fig . [ fig:5 ] .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of nonlocal quantum signaling by analyzing polarization - entangled and path - entangled systems .",
    "the conjecture@xcite that nonlocal signaling might be possible by adjusting the entanglement to 71% to permit coherence has proved to be incorrect .",
    "instead , we find that in all cases investigated the interference is blocked by a  signal \" interference pattern and an  anti - signal \" interference pattern that mask any observable interference when they are added , even when entanglement and coherence are simultaneously present . this behavior is again attributed to what has been called the complementarity of one - particle and two - particle interference@xcite .",
    "our conclusion , based on the standard formalism of quantum mechanics as applied to these _ gedankenexperiments _ , is that no nonlocal signal can be transmitted from alice to bob by varying alice s configuration in any of the ways discussed here . in all of the cases",
    "studied , there are two quantum - distinguishable modes of entangled photon - pair behavior that each contain aswitch - able \" interference pattern , but when these modes are superimposed , the two interference patterns always complement each other and together become invisible .",
    "this is the mechanism by which the formalism of quantum mechanics blocks nonlocal signaling . in the context of the standard quantum formalism",
