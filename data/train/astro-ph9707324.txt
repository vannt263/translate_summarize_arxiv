    "with the announcement of a supernova in the large magellanic cloud ( shelton 1987 ) , many astronomers in the southern hemisphere stopped the projects they were working on , and began programs of the long - term monitoring of this unique object .",
    "a tremendous literature has developed on the observation and theory of the supernova . at the time of this conference , there are more than 1000 refereed papers listed under `` sn 1987a '' by the astrophysics data system of nasa . in this short contribution , i would like to summarize the observational work on the photometry and spectrophotometry of sn 1987a , and discuss the stellar population surrounding the supernova .",
    "in the years following the explosion of sanduleak 69202 on ut 7:36 23 feb 1987 or jd 2446849.8165 ( bratton _ et al . _ 1988 , hirata _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) , all major southern hemisphere observatories followed the photometric evolution sn 1987a in optical and infrared colors .",
    "in addition , iue and later hst measured photometric indices . for ground - based observatories , it was not always easy finding a telescope _ small _ enough to follow the supernova .",
    "the ground - based observations were also complicated by the fact that the only detector generally available was a single channel device such as a photoelectric photometer .",
    "a measurement therefore required photometric weather ( not a problem today with ccd detectors and fainter sne ) or at least scattered clouds so that quick differential photometry could be done relative to a nearby standard like @xmath6 doradus . at maximum light on day 84.5 , the supernova was @xmath7 ( hamuy & suntzeff 1990 ) . at this brightness",
    ", we had to reduce the aperture of the 0.4 m telescope at ctio by using the hartmann mask , and masking off all but 5 holes , leaving a collecting area of only 26 @xmath8 !",
    "future bright events may leave observatories unprepared as small telescopes are closed in the face of financial pressures .",
    "each observatory published the photometric data in a number of different papers .",
    "generally the last paper in the series contains references to the earlier papers . here",
    "i will list only the latest paper from the series of publications of a particular observatory group .",

    "we can not directly measure the `` uvoir '' bolometric luminosity at these late times because we do not have 10 - 30 micron fluxes .",
    "however , we can use the bolometric corrections to the optical colors @xmath20 to estimate a bolometric magnitude on the assumption that the flux distribution is indeed frozen . under this assumption ,",
    "the uvoir luminosity on day 3600 is log@xmath1(l ) @xmath2 in units of ergs s@xmath3 .    from the re - analysis of the early photographic and photoelectric data ,",
    "the early - time light curve has been improved ( west & mcnaught 1992 , shelton 1993a , shelton & lapasset 1993 ) . in figure [ f2 ] i plot the data from these papers along with the early ctio , saao , and lco photoelectric photometry .",

    "the jones limit happened 1.8 hours after the neutrino detections .",
    "the first optical detection was made by mcnaught at 3.1 hours after outburst .      as summarized by melnick in this conference , sk 69202",
    "was located about 4  from the center of the loose cluster ngc 2044 ( lh90 ) near ngc 2070 ( 30 doradus ) .",
    "the whole region is enveloped in emission associated with the star formation in the 30 dor complex . at the position of sk",
    "69202 there is no large - scale star formation activity as in ngc 2044 or ngc 2050 to the south .",
    "walker & suntzeff ( 1990 ) however noted a small young association within 30  of the supernova , which is called kmk80 in the catalog of kontizas _ et al . _",
    "efrevmov ( 1991 ) and walborn _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) have estimated the age of this association at @xmath21myrs using the ctio photometry .",
    "( 1996 ) have estimated an upper limit ( dependent on mass loss ) to the age of star 2 at 13myrs .",
    "this , of course , is similar to the age estimate for sk 69202 of 11myrs by arnett _",
    "( 1989 ) .    the field population near sn 1987a can be seen in more detail in figure [ f3 ] . here",

    "( 1994 ) and the photometry of sk 69202 from walborn _ et al . _",
    "i have used a reddening of @xmath23 and a true distance modulus of 18.50 .",
    "these data were taken in january and march 1996 at the ctio 4 m telescope cfccd system by mark phillips .",
    "a total of seven frames in each color were used to calculate the magnitudes .",
    "the large scatter about the main sequence down to @xmath24 is not due to photometric errors , but due to variable reddening ( walborn _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows that the young field population within 25  of the supernova is consistent with a population of @xmath25myr , although this value critically depends on the accuracy of the theoretical @xmath26 to @xmath27 conversion , the reddening , and the small number of hot stars .",
    "there is also a dominant older field population with a prominent turnoff at @xmath28 which corresponds to a 1.5gyr population .",
    "these two populations are not well mixed however .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows that _ the young field population is strongly concentrated towards the position of sn 1987a_. this can be shown with simple statistics .",
    "divide the field by a circle with radius of 25(projected distance of @xmath29pc ) around sn 1987a and count the number of hot stars , defined here simply as any star with @xmath30 .",
    "form the ratio of the number of stars with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the ratios for inside and outside the circle are 14/23 and 20/178 or 61% versus 17% .",
    "furthermore , of the eight brightest hot stars in this region ( @xmath33 ) , four are inside the circle ( stars 2,3,10,30 ) , and two are inside 3 ! given such statistics , it is extremely likely that sk 69202 was part of a loose association including khk80 with an age of @xmath25myr , and that stars 2 and 3 , which are less than 3away , are physically associated with progenitor of the supernova .",
    "however , because there is no obvious interaction of the outer rings of the supernova with stars 2 and 3 , it is unlikely that the supernova lies in precisely the same plane on the sky as the two crowding stars .",
    "this paper is the summary of the work of many astronomers who have collaborated to bring this photometry to the astronomical community .",
