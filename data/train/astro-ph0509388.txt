    "lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) form the main galaxy population observed in the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) at high redshift .",
    "lbgs are similar to local starbursts and it was suggested that these objects are forming stars at a high rate ( pettini et al .",
    "2000 ; teplitz et al .",
    "2000 ) . observed colors of lbgs are redder than dust - free star - forming objects .",
    "however , the actual amount of dust in lbgs and the total star formation rate ( sfr ) is still insecure because high redshift lbgs are mainly undetected in the fir / sub - mm range and only small lbg samples are available ( chapman et al . 2000 ;",
    "huang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the morphology of lbgs is also a matter of debate ( see giavalisco 2002 ) .",
    "early works suggested that lbgs could be ellipsoidal and perhaps the progenitor of ellipticals or bulges of today galaxies .",
    "the problem is that we can hardly detect low surface brightness areas above @xmath0 ( burgarella et al .",
    ". however , papovich et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the morphology of a nir - selected sample of galaxies at @xmath7 have regular and symmetric morphologies while a @xmath8 sample present irregular and/or compact morphologies .",
    "observations in the sub - mm range introduced fir - bright galaxies which might be similar to ( ultra ) luminous ir galaxies ( ( u)lirgs ) ( blain et al . 1999 ) with @xmath9 for lirgs and @xmath10 for ulirgs that are likely to dominate the cosmic infrared background ( elbaz & cesarsky 2003 ) at high redshift .",
    "the link between lbgs and lirgs is still an open question .",
    "are they two different classes of objects ?",
    "are they two facets of the same population ?",
    "could we correct uv fluxes for the dust attenuation to recover the full star formation density ?    in this paper , we combine the detection of true ( i.e. with a detected break ) lbgs at @xmath0 thanks to @xmath1 ( e.g. morrissey et al . 2005 ) with 24 @xmath4 @xmath11 ( rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) data to estimate the total dust emission and the dust - to - uv flux ratio .",
    "we also use goods images to analyse the morphology . a cosmology with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "is assumed .",
    "to build the sample , we use @xmath1 data that are cross - correlated with combo-17 to get redshifts and @xmath11 to get @xmath15 fluxes .",
    "we down - select objects that combo-17 ( wolf et al .",
    "2004 ) clearly puts in the `` galaxy '' class .",
    "we extract sources with redshifts @xmath16 .",
    "we keep only objects down to galex nuv = 24.5 corresponding to galex 80 % completeness level ( 456 objects ) .",
    "then , we select 344 fuv - dropout objects with @xmath17 .",
    "the observed fuv and nuv filters are in the same rest - frame wavelength ranges than @xmath18 and @xmath19 and this selection is consistent with high redshift works ( e.g. giavalisco et al .",
    "2002 for a review ) . of this list , 90 objects ( 23.3 % )",
    "have a measured flux above the 80 % completeness limit of spitzer 24 @xmath4 data ( e.g. prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2005 ) and 264 ( 76.7 % ) only have upper limits .",
    "this sample of 344 lbgs in the redshift range @xmath16 constitutes the database that we will study in this work .",
    "this is the first lbg sample in this redshift range that can be used as a basis to which higher redshift lbgs can be compared .",
    "1 shows two lbgs at several wavelengths including the two @xmath1 bands , the b and r eis bands and the @xmath20 @xmath11 band .",
    "we find a large range of observed ( i.e. uncorrected for dust attenuations ) fuv luminosities with @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 . the luminosity range ( assuming @xmath23 ) is wider than either the @xmath0 or the @xmath24 one in adelberger & steidel ( 2000 ; a&s00 ) .",
    "our lbgs reach luminosities as faint as a&s00 balmer break sample at @xmath0 but as bright as their lbg sample at @xmath24 .",
    "total ir luminosities @xmath25 are estimated from @xmath26 ( i.e. @xmath27 a t @xmath7 from takeuchi et al .",
    "2005 ) . in our lbg sample ,",
    "20 - 30 % are uv luminous galaxies ( uvlgs ; heckman et al .",
    "the ir luminosity range of the sample is about @xmath28 , which means that essentially all lbgs are compatible with a classification into lirgs .",
    "an association between uvlgs and lirgs was already proposed by burgarella et al .",
    "we confirm here that uv - luminous galaxies are also ir - luminous objects and extend it to lbgs .",
    "the cdfs was observed by goods and we can deduce a morphological information in the rest - frame b band .",
    "the advantage of observing lbgs at low redshift is obviously to have a better indication of their true morphology and not only the high surface brightness regions .",
    "we used asymmetries and concentrations from lauger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to build fig .  2 . from @xmath29 observations",
    ", it was found that lbgs at @xmath30 can have a wide dispersion of morphology but they generally appear to be smaller , irregular - like and compact ( papovich et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , we must be careful in the interpretation because of the cosmological dimming ( e.g. burgarella et al .",
    "2001 but see papovich et al .",
    "note , however , that in some rare deep spectroscopic observations ( mooorwood et al . 2000 ; pettini et al .",
    "2001 ) , the profile of optical nebular lines suggests the presence of disks in some high - z lbgs .",
    "3 leads us to the three following conclusions : i ) all but one lbgs are disk - dominated galaxies , ii ) one of them might be associated to bulge - dominated galaxies within the uncertainties and iii ) part of them ( 21 % ) are in the top part of the diagram , i.e. with an asymmetry larger than 0.25 and could be interpreted as mergers .",
    "a number of studies have been devoted to the morphology of galaxy in the redshift range @xmath31 ( e.g. wolf et al .",
    "2005 ; lauger et al .",
    "2005 ; zheng et al .",
    "2004 ; papovich et al .",
    "the figure emerging from these papers is that most of the star formation at @xmath32 resides in disks and about half in spirals .",
    "we find that @xmath33 % of the lbgs are likely mergers ( e.g. fig .",
    "1b ) , @xmath34 % are disks ( e.g. fig .",
    "1a ) and only @xmath35 % ( i.e. 1 galaxy ) is a spheroid .",
    "given that almost all our lbgs can also be classified as lirgs from their ir luminosity , our classification is also consistent with the lirg morphology carried out by zheng et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "[ [ ultraviolet - dust - attenuations - and - implications - on - the - cosmic - star - formation - density ] ] ultraviolet dust attenuations and implications on the cosmic star formation density ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    so far , it was difficult to estimate the validity of dust attenuations of lbgs , because we had no clear idea of @xmath25 .",
    "a&s00 tried to estimate the @xmath36 fluxes of their lbg sample from the @xmath37 method ( e.g. calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ) and compared them to observations .",
    "but , only the most extreme ones can be detected and used to safely estimate a calibration . in this paper",
    ", we use total ir luminosities @xmath25 , and @xmath38 to compute the fir / uv ratio which is calibrated into fuv dust attenuation @xmath39 ( e.g. burgarella et al .",
    "this method has been shown to provide better dust attenuations than the uv slope @xmath37 .",
    "4a shows that the total ir luminosity correlates with the uv dust attenuation ( e.g. a&s00 ) .",
    "on the other hand , we observe an apparent anti - correlation of @xmath39 with the uv luminosity which might be an observational bias .",
    "it is very interesting to note that we do not detect lbgs with both a high uv luminosity and a high uv dust attenuation , and this can not be caused by observational limits .",
    "in other words , we seem to observe a population of high-@xmath38 lbgs ( which qualify as uvlgs ) with dust attenuations similar to uv - selected galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. buat et al . 2005 ) .    using a&s00 equations we estimate the ir luminosity ( fig .",
    "globally , points estimated from the @xmath37 method are in the same region but shifted towards the top - right part of the diagram .",
    "this method seems to overestimate @xmath25 ( i.e. the dust attenuation ) as compared to observed fir luminosities .",
    "the @xmath37-based average dust attenuation estimated for our sample at @xmath0 is @xmath40 while the fir - to - uv average dust attenuation amounts to @xmath41 ( which is is fully consistent with takeuchi , buat & burgarella 2005 ) .",
    "both of them are marginally consistent but the net effect is that total @xmath37-based luminosities , are larger than the actual values by a factor of about 2 in average and therefore provide higher sfrs .",
    "this means that the influence of lbgs in the evolution of the star formation density might be overestimated , at least at @xmath0 and the cosmic star formation density estimated from lbgs should be decreased by a factor of 2 .",
