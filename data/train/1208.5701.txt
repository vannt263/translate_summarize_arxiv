    "the common view of charge density wave ( cdw ) formation was originally posed in the work by kohn @xcite .",
    "using kohn s reasoning @xcite , the tendency towards ordering is particularly strong in low dimensions , because the fermi surface has parallel parts , referred to as nesting .",
    "this nesting leads to a divergence in the lindhard susceptibility , determining the magnitude and direction of the ordering vector * q*@xcite .",
    "this divergence in the electronic susceptibility is conveyed to the lattice via the electron - phonon coupling , so that a phonon softens to zero frequency at * q * and a static lattice distortion develops when the system enters the cdw state ; a behavior known as the kohn anomaly .",
    "however , several publications raise the question as to whether nesting alone is sufficient to explain the observed ordering direction * q *  @xcite , particularly in dimensions higher than one .",
    "a central question is whether the selection of the cdw ordering vector is always driven by an electronic instability , or if the ordering vector could instead be determined by a lattice distortion driven by some other mechanism exploiting the role of the electron - phonon coupling . in the latter case",
    ", the selected ordering vector would not necessarily nest the fermi surface .",
    "the importance of strongly momentum dependent electron - phonon coupling on cdw formation was pointed out in refs . and , where the relevance of the fermi surface for determining the ordering vector was indeed found to decrease as the coupling strength increases . in a recent paper on inelastic x - ray scattering measurements on 2@xmath1-nbse@xmath2 , acoustic phonons",
    "were observed to soften to zero frequency over an extended region around the cdw ordering vector @xcite .",
    "the authors argue that this behavior is not consistent with a kohn anomaly picture , where sharp dips are expected .",
    "therefore , the phonon softening must be driven by another mechanism , which they identify as a wavevector - dependent electron - phonon coupling .",
    "in addition , previous studies on chromium  @xcite and ruthenium  @xcite have also shown dips in phonon dispersions arising from such anisotropic electron - phonon matrix elements .",

    "the electron - phonon matrix element is proportional to the electron - photon matrix element from raman spectroscopy . as a result ,",
    "raman spectroscopy , which efficiently projects out different regions of the brillouin zone with different photon polarizations , can provide an indirect method for investigating the momentum - dependence of the electron - phonon coupling in a system .    to set the stage for our discussion",
    ", we introduce the two - dimensional rare - earth tri - tellurides ( @xmath20te@xmath0 ) , as shown in fig.[fig : structure]_a_. among them the prototypical erte@xmath0 ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) undergoes a first cdw transition at  @xmath21k , followed by a second one at  @xmath22k and allows a robust access to its intrinsic cdw properties .",
    "the ordering vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 are parallel to but incommensurate with the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively  @xcite",
    ". the electronic properties of these layered cdw compounds can be modeled by considering a single te plane [ fig.[fig : structure]_b _ and appendix  [ appendixc]:supporting information  ( si ) ] .",
    "the two dominant hopping terms are @xmath27 and @xmath28 along and perpendicular to the overlapping @xmath5 or @xmath6 orbitals , respectively , leading to slightly warped fermi surface planes ( fig.[fig : structure]_c _ ) .",
    "for this band structure , yao and coworkers @xcite studied the influence of band - filling and electron - phonon coupling strength on the charge ordering and established a strong coupling limit for the experimentally observed stripe - like cdw state .",
    "additionally , johannes and mazin @xcite found that the lindhard susceptibility has peaks of comparable size at the nesting vector @xmath13 predicted from the band structure , and at the cdw ordering vector @xmath12 , determined experimentally in @xmath20te@xmath0 @xcite ( fig.[fig : structure]_c _ ) .",
    "this is quite similar to a recent observation in nbse@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a small but non - zero hopping term between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath29 , lifts the degeneracy at the intersection points of the two quasi 1d fermi surfaces , as emphasized in fig.[fig : structure]_d _ , and improves the agreement with the experimental fermi surface , even though @xmath30 remains the best nesting vector @xcite .",
    "therefore , mechanisms beyond purely electronic ones have been conjectured to play an important role in selecting the ordering vector and in density wave formation .",
    "these include orthorhombicity , the tendency towards phase separation and nematicity via the coulomb interaction , strongly momentum dependent electron - phonon interaction due to peculiarities of the band structure , breakdown of the coulomb screening and other competing instabilities , such as magnetism @xcite .    in this research report",
    ", we analyze data from raman experiments and the related selection rules for erte@xmath31 and demonstrate that the lifting of band degeneracies enhances the light - scattering sensitivity and , concomitantly , the electron - phonon coupling at ordering vectors that do not coincide with those vectors predicted by nesting alone .",

    "the am appears in both polarizations , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with an intensity ratio of @xmath452:1 . upon further cooling the am moves to higher energies , couples to phonons @xcite , and gains more than one order of magnitude in intensity @xcite . at the lowest temperature it saturates at @xmath46 ( fig.[fig : am]_c _ , peak@xmath44 ) .",

    "for the system studied here , the electron - phonon coupling vertex , like the raman vertex , is highly anisotropic in momentum space .",

    "it is the focusing effect of the stress tensor which selects the experimentally observed ordering wave vector @xmath12 . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the huge modulation of the raman vertex indicates strong fluctuations of the charge density in the vicinity of the degeneracy points .",
    "these fluctuations manifest themselves in the raman response above @xmath82 ( fig.[fig : fluctuations ] ) where the lattice still has the full c@xmath42 symmetry .",
    "yao and coworkers showed in the framework of a landau expansion of the free energy @xcite that both charge fluctuations and electron - phonon coupling cooperate to drive the system towards the experimental ordering vector . the substantial charge fluctuations couple",
    "to and soften the phonon relevant for the cdw ordering . taking into account the large electron - phonon coupling near the band degeneracy points ( fig.[fig : theory ] )",
    ", the charge fluctuations actually renormalize the phonon frequency at the momenta @xmath83 rather than * q*@xmath84 ( and the equivalent orthogonal vector ) .",
    "below , the weak orthorhombicity along with the relatively large electron - phonon coupling @xcite then tips the balance , and * q*@xmath15 aligns along @xmath56 rather than @xmath57 .",
    "finally , upon further lowering the temperature below @xmath19 @xmath85 aligns along @xmath57 since the fermi surface along the @xmath56 direction is already fully gapped by the first transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , we identify two cooperating effects determining the overall selection of the ordering vector : ( i ) the system gains energy by gapping the band degeneracy points on the fermi surface where the raman selection rules indicate substantial fluctuations with fourfold symmetry above .",
    "( ii ) since the electron - phonon coupling vertex is proportional to the raman vertex for stress phonons @xcite , both quantities are enhanced near band degeneracies . for small hybridization and an electron - phonon coupling strength of @xmath86 the focussing effect",
    "may even be the most relevant contribution to the phonon renormalization , and thus the cdw formation , while it is only a correction for larger @xmath11 .",
    "hence , while electron - phonon coupling is known to be important in cdw systems @xcite , we identify on a microscopic basis the focussing effect to be a more generic paradigm for multiband materials . as a future outlook",
    ", it seems particularly interesting to explore this novel scenario in the proximity of superconductivity , eventually competing or coexisting with cdw order .",
    "in fact , superconductivity at approximately @xmath87 appears in some of the rare earth tri - tellurides if the cdw is suppressed by applied pressure @xcite .",
    "moreover , it would be intriguing to address in a wider context the effects of band hybridization in materials such as the iron - based superconductors @xcite , in which density - wave order and superconductivity interplay on a microscopic scale .",
