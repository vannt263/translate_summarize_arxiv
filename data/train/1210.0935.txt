    "similar terms appear when a system is driven by a broadband squeezed light reservoir  @xcite and are sometimes referred to as `` anomalous correlations '' . as might be expected , the excitation - dependent rates depend upon the phonon correlation function , the coherent pump rate , and the laser - exciton detuning .",

    "@xmath71ev the relevant rates can be assumed to be constant .",
    "therefore , these values will be treated as constant in the following to compute the analytical mollow triplets .      to get better insight into the underlying physics , it is desirable to derive an analytical form for the mollow triplet spectrum , which we derive from the effective phonon me",

    "[ thfig2 ] , a direct comparison between the numerically calculated mollow triplet based on the full polaron and the effective phonon me is shown , revealing excellent agreement even for large detunings @xmath72ev and high field strengths of @xmath73ev . the main reason that one can neglect the pump - dependence of the phase terms in eq .",
    "( [ me1 ] ) is that  for the pump values we consider  one ps timescale , phonon correlation times are much faster than the inverse rabi oscillation .",
    "we highlight that a cw rabi field of @xmath74ev is already close to the highest achievable experiments to date , and thus for our purposes can be considered the high - field regime .",

    "3(d ) of their paper ) on a qd embedded in a micropillar cavity structure , grown by molecular beam epitaxy .",

    "previous numerical studies were performed in this regime  @xcite , but did not obtain this behaviour , suggesting that further work is required to explain the significant narrowing effects that are observed in the experiment .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a combined theoretical - experimental study on the impact of pure dephasing and phonon - induced scattering on the excitation detuning - dependence of mollow triplet sidebands .",
    "based on a polaron master equation approach , supplemented by an analytical solution for the mollow triplet spectra , it is possible to clearly distinguish different regimes of spectral broadening or narrowing , defined by the ratio of different dephasing contributions . for the case of",
