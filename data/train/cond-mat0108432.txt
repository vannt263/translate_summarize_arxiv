    "it appears that for spin systems with constant isotropic antiferromagnetic next - neighbour heisenberg exchange the minimal energy @xmath0 for given total spin quantum number @xmath1 is typically a strictly convex function of @xmath1 . for many spin topologies like rings , cubes , icosahedra etc",
    "this function is very close to a parabola @xcite . for certain systems",
    "this behaviour has been explained with the help of the underlying sublattice structure @xcite .",
    "experimentally this property has been described as  following the land interval rule \" @xcite . in the classical limit , where the single - spin quantum number @xmath2 goes to infinity ,",
    "the function @xmath0 is even an exact parabola if the system possesses co - planar ground states @xcite .",
    "however , we find that for certain coupling topologies , including the cuboctahedron and the icosidodecadron @xcite , this rule is violated for high total spins .",
    "more precisely , for the icosidodecadron the last four points of the graph of @xmath3 versus @xmath1 , i.  e.  the points with @xmath4 to @xmath5 , lie on a straight line @xmath6 an analogous statement holds for the last three points of the corresponding graph for the cuboctahedron .",
    "these findings are based on numerical calculations of the minimal energies for several @xmath2 both for the icosidodecahedron as well as for the cuboctahedron . for both systems ,",
    "additionally , we have a rigorous proof of the high spin anomaly for the case of @xmath7 .",
    "this proof rests on an inequality which says that all points of the graph of @xmath3 versus @xmath1 lie above or on the line connecting the last two points (  bounding line \" ) .",
    "the proof can be easily applied to a wide class of spin systems , e.g. to two - dimensional spin arrays .    the observed anomaly  linear instead of parabolic dependence  results in a corresponding jump of the magnetisation curve @xmath8 versus @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , for systems which obey the land interval rule the magnetisation curve at very low temperatures is a staircase with equal steps up to the highest magnetisation .",
    "the anomaly could indeed be observed in magnetisation measurements of the so - called keplerate structure \\{mo@xmath10fe@xmath11 } which is a recently synthezised magnetic molecule where 30 fe@xmath12 paramagnetic ions ( spins @xmath13 ) occupy the sites of a perfect icosidodecahedron and interact via isotropic , next - neighbour antiferromagnetic exchange @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the magnetisation measurements @xcite performed so far suffer from too high temperatures which smear out the anomaly .    nevertheless , it may be possible to observe truely giant magnetisation jumps in certain two - dimensional spin systems which possess a suitable coupling topology . in such systems",
    "the magnetisation jump can be of the same order as the number of spins , i.e. the jump remains finite  or is macroscopic  in the thermodynamic limit @xmath14 .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ s-2 ]",
    "we introduce basic definitions and explain how the results have been obtained . in section [ s-3 ] the high spin anomaly is discussed and proven for the case of @xmath7 .",
    "we provide an outlook in section [ s-4 ] .",
    "the heisenberg hamilton operator of the investigated spin systems is @xmath15 where the exchange parameters @xmath16 are considered as the components of a symmetric matrix @xmath17 , i.e. every bond is taken into account twice . in particular , we assume @xmath18 and @xmath19 which corresponds to antiferromagnetic coupling . in equation ( [ e-1 ] ) , @xmath20 is the spectroscopic splitting factor and @xmath21 the bohr magneton .",
    "the vector operators @xmath22 are the spin operators ( in units of @xmath23 ) of the individual @xmath24 paramagnetic ions with constant spin quantum number @xmath2 . because the matrix @xmath17 couples only next - neighbours ( see fig .  [ f-1 ] ) the second sum in runs over the set @xmath25 of all next - neighbour pairs @xmath26 of spins of a single molecule at sites @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath25 can be regarded as the set of  edges \" of the corresponding undirected graph describing the coupling scheme of the molecule .",
    "the  vertices \" of the graph correspond to the spin sites @xmath29 . for each spin site @xmath27",
    "let @xmath30 denote the set of neighbours of @xmath27 . throughout this article",
    "we will assume that the number of neighbours per site is constant , say @xmath31 .",
    "the  distance \" between two spin sites @xmath27 and @xmath28 will be the minimal number of edges connecting @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( similar to the manhattan distance ) .",
    "@xmath32    as mentioned already in the introduction the anomaly was found numerically .",
    "for this purpose the hamilton matrix had to be diagonalized .",
    "the total matrix is a huge object of dimension @xmath33 which must be block - diagonalized in advance . using that the hamilton operator commutes with @xmath34 ,",
    "the ising product states which are a natural basis can be grouped according to the quantum numbers @xmath35 , thereby dividing the hilbert space into orthogonal subspaces @xmath36 .",
    "a further reduction of dimension is achieved if the symmetries of the spin array are exploited .",
    "the icosidodecahedron for instance shows a tenfold shift symmetry leading to hilbert subspaces @xmath37 with @xmath38 . within these subspaces",
    "a lanczos procedure was applied in order to obtain the respective minimal energies .",
    "the resulting minimal energies @xmath0 are shown by dashes on the l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ f-3 ] for the isosidodecahedron and on the l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ f-4 ] for the cuboctahedron .",
    "the straight lines denote the bounding lines , which connect the highest four levels in the case of the isosidodecahedron and the highest three in the case of the cuboctahedron . at @xmath39",
    "this behavior leads to jumps of the magnetisation @xmath8 @xmath40 due to the effect that the states lie exactly on the bounding line in the graph of @xmath3 versus @xmath1 they  take over \" for the new total ground state at the same value of the magnetic field , therefore the magnetisation immediately jumps to the highest value .",
    "the jumps are marked by arrows in the magnetisation curves of the isosidodecahedron ( r.h.s .",
    "[ f-3 ] ) and the cubeoctahedron ( r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ f-4 ] ) .    for systems which follow the land interval rule , i.e. where @xmath0 is a parabolic function of @xmath1 , the corresponding magnetisation curve would consist of equal steps .",
    "a necessary condition for the anomaly is certainly that the minimal energy in the one - magnon space is degenerate .",
    "therefore , localized one - magnon states can be constructed which are also of minimal energy .",
    "when placing a second localized one - magnon eigenstate on the spin array there will be a chance that it does not interact with the first one if a large enough separation can be achieved .",
    "this new two - magnon state is likely the state of minimal energy in the two - magnon hilbert space because for antiferromagnetic interaction two - magnon bound states do not exist ( at least for @xmath7 ) .",
    "this procedure can be continued until no further independent magnon can be placed on the spin array . in a sense",
    "the system behaves as if it consists of non - interacting bosons which , up to a limiting number , can condense into a single - particle ground state .    in more mathematical terms : in order to prove the high - spin anomaly we first show an inequality which says that all points @xmath41 lie above or on the line connecting the last two points .",
    "this inequality holds for @xmath7 and all systems with constant antiferromagnetic exchange parameter and a constant number of neighbours for each spin site . for specific systems as those mentioned above what remains to be done",
    "is to construct particular states which exactly assume the values of @xmath3 corresponding to the points lying on the bounding line , then these states are automatically states of minimal energy .",
    "note that the high spin anomaly does not contradict the strict convexity of the graph of @xmath3 versus @xmath1 in the classical limit , since in the limit @xmath42 the interval where the anomaly occurs , e.  g.  @xmath5 to @xmath4 , becomes an infinitesimally small fraction of the total spin range .",
