    "we would like to thank marc genton and william kleiber ( hereafter , gk ) for their informative review of cross - covariance functions in multivariate spatial statistics and the editor for the opportunity to contribute to the discussion .",
    "physical processes rarely occur in isolation , rather they influence and interact with one another . thus , there is great benefit in modeling potential dependence between both spatial locations and different processes .",
    "it is the interaction between these two dependencies that is the focus of gk .",
    "we see the problem of ensuring that the matrix given in gk-(2 ) is nonnegative definite ( n.n.d . ) as important , but we also see it as a means to an end . that `` end '' is solving the scientific problem of predicting a multivariate field of , say , temperature and rainfall , based on noisy and spatially incomplete data from weather stations in a region of interest . there is also scientific interest in the behavior of the measures of cross - spatial dependence ( e.g. , cross - covariance functions ) , but usually spatial prediction is the ultimate goal .    of course , an interim goal is estimation of the means , covariances and cross - covariances , but not a lot of gk s review was devoted to this .",
    "the nonparametric estimators given by gk-(6 ) and gk-(11 ) are useful for recognizing which parametric _ class _ of valid cross - covariance functions might represent the multivariate spatial dependence in the data .",
    "estimation of the parameters in this class is usually obtained by weighted least squares or maximum likelihood .",
    "optimal spatial prediction in practice proceeds by substituting these parameter estimates into the model and computing the optimal data weights as if the parameters were known .",
    "because of this , predictors and their standard errors are biased .",
    "these and other issues ( e.g. , change - of - support ) are well known in the univariate spatial setting , and they clearly also arise in the multivariate spatial setting .    one problem that arises in multivariate spatial statistics , but that is not discussed very much by gk , is collocation ( or not ) of spatial data from the different variables . this might be viewed as a missing - data problem , for which a hierarchical multivariate spatial statistical model offers a path forward .",
    "being hierarchical does not necessarily mean being bayesian , as the next section on latent modeling demonstrates .",
    "the multivariate spatial models in gk do not account for the measurement error that exists for all physical observations .",
    "their multivariate spatial processes are written as @xmath0 , and valid spatial - covariance models @xmath1 are constructed for them .",
    "gk s models are almost all `` smooth , '' in the sense that @xmath2    however , an observation or potential observation is observed with error , since no measuring instrument is perfect .",
    "therefore , if the observations are @xmath3 , then there is a hidden ( or latent ) process @xmath4 such that @xmath5 where @xmath6 has mean zero and covariance matrix @xmath7 .",
    "further , the measurement process is independent of the latent process , and it is usually reasonable to assume that it is independent from one observation to another , that is , @xmath8 , for @xmath9 .",
    "it appears that gk build multivariate spatial covariance models for the latent process , yet the definition of @xmath10 in gk-(6 ) is based on observations that always come with measurement error .",
    "hence , @xmath10 is estimating a @xmath11 that satisfies @xmath12    the difference of the two matrices above is in fact the measurement - error covariance matrix , which we denote as @xmath13 in the stationary case [ i.e. , where @xmath14 depends only on @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "this mismatch between ( [ eq:3 ] ) and the stationary version of ( [ eq:1 ] ) , namely , @xmath18 , can be resolved once one realizes that gk are really building models for a latent @xmath19-process , and that a full multivariate spatial covariance function for the @xmath20-process ( i.e. , the observations ) is obtained by additionally modeling the measurement - error covariance , @xmath21 . in their second example ( gk - section  6.2 ) , gk recognize the need for @xmath13 : `` due to the fact that the data are observational , we augment each process covariance with a nugget effect . ''",
    "however , there are potentially nonzero off - diagonal terms in @xmath13 .",
    "notice that the two variables in gk - section  6.2 are observed maximum and minimum temperatures obtained from the _ same _ instrument at location @xmath22 , say , and , hence , the measurement error for the maximum , @xmath23 , and the measurement error for the minimum , @xmath24 , should be correlated .",
    "gk s choice of a diagonal matrix for @xmath25 does not reflect this .",
    "while it may not be obvious , there are also circumstances where a `` measurement error '' component is needed when modeling deterministic spatio - temporal output from computer experiments , such as those used in gk - section  6.1 .",
    "this component is actually a spatio - temporal interaction that `` hides '' the latent spatial process ( @xcite ) .    finally , it is possible that a latent @xmath19-process is itself not `` smooth . '' in this case",
    ", we can write the latent process as @xmath26 where the @xmath27-process is smooth [ i.e. , satisfies ( [ eq:1 ] ) ] and where the @xmath28-process is independent of the @xmath29-process and has mean zero .",
    "often , it is assumed that @xmath30 is independent of @xmath31 for any @xmath32 and , when @xmath33 .",
    "when modeling univariate spatial data , there has been considerable inconsistency in the literature regarding how to handle the @xmath34-process ( micro - scale variation ) and the @xmath35-process ( measurement - error process ) . that confusion should also be avoided in the multivariate spatial setting .",
    "we need both @xmath36 and @xmath13 for different purposes , and these different roles should be accounted for : we wish to filter out the @xmath37-process ( since it is extraneous to the true , hidden @xmath19-process ) , but we wish to predict the @xmath28-process ( since it represents the scientific process at micro - scales ) .",
    "the presence of both processes is manifested in @xmath10 , for @xmath38 near @xmath39 , but without more information than that supplied by the multivariate spatial data , the @xmath40-process and the @xmath41-process are confounded .",
    "a small amount of gk s review of cross - covariances discusses cross - variograms and generalized covariance functions , since they are stationary when the process @xmath42 is differenced . before differencing",
    ", the process is nonstationary .",
    "there are a number of ways to do the differencing in a multivariate context , leading to a lack of agreement among researchers of how to capture the cross - dependence between the processes @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for many scientific purposes ,",
    "the key goal is optimal multivariate spatial prediction .",
    "therefore , the key measure of multivariate spatial dependence should be one that can be used , without fail , in kriging and co - kriging ( i.e. , spatial prediction ) equations .",
    "that is , the optimal weights in the linear combination of the spatial data , @xmath45 , should depend on this measure .",
    "if a measure sometimes yields nonoptimal weights , we suggest that it is not as interesting as one that does .",
    "while gk-(1 ) and gk-(4 ) yield optimal weights , the ( covariance - based ) cross - variograms given by gk-(3 ) do not always .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) give an example where use of gk-(3 ) in spatial multivariate prediction yields nonoptimal weights .",
    "indeed , it is gk-(3 ) that should have been tagged `` pseudo '' in the literature , not gk-(4 ) .",
    "the article that gives the most general multivariate spatial dependence measure that is a function of @xmath46 is @xcite , who define the generalized cross - covariance functions .",
    "certainly , researchers familiarity with these more general forms of stationary cross - dependence is not high , but the interpretation of the appropriate cross - variograms given by gk-(4 ) is not difficult ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have found that for _ univariate _ spatial processes , the estimation of spatial - dependence parameters is achieved more stably through the variogram than the covariance function ( @xcite , section  2.4.1 ) . on the other hand , because optimal spatial prediction using a valid covariance function can be used without fail ( @xcite , section  4.1.2 ) , we recommend the following inferential strategy for _ multivariate _ spatial processes : put the cross - variogram at the core of parameter estimation and the cross - covariance function at the core of optimal multivariate spatial prediction .",
    "we conclude that , for multivariate spatial processes , the appropriate cross - variograms given by gk-(4 ) have great potential for the purpose of estimation , and there is a need for a research program to pursue the interpretation and robust estimation of gk-(4 ) , but _ not _ of the inappropriate gk-(3 ) .",
    "let @xmath47 $ ] denote the probability distribution of the argument within square brackets .",
    "gk tackle cross - covariance construction from the perspective of the _ joint _ distribution , @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "conditional _ approach to constructing cross - covariance functions writes the joint distribution as the product , @xmath49[z_1(\\cdot)]$ ] .",
    "consider the space @xmath50 discretized onto a fine - resolution grid , @xmath51 , such that the processes @xmath52 and @xmath53 are represented as @xmath54-dimensional vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . in practice , this is how a continuously indexed process is represented in a computer program .",
    "then , from @xcite ( @xcite , page 160 ) , the conditional approach yields the bivariate spatial model , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are n.n.d .",
    "matrices obtained from univariate spatial processes , and the @xmath60 matrix @xmath61 of real - valued entries is unrestricted . critically ,",
    "the joint matrix , @xmath62 , is always n.n.d .    equations ( [ eq:6 - 1])([eq:6 - 3 ] ) are obtained from @xmath63 which only involve univariate spatial processes .",
    "it should be emphasized that the conditioning in ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:8 ] ) is on the whole process @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast to what has been stated elsewhere ( @xcite , page 273 ) , there is no attempt in the conditional approach to build a joint distribution solely from @xmath64 , for @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , @xmath66=\\int\\cdots\\int \\frac { [ z_{2}(\\mathbf { s}_{i})|\\mathbf { z}_{1 }   ] [ \\mathbf { z}_{1}]}{[z_{1}(\\mathbf { s}_{i})]}\\,d\\mathbf { z}_{1,-i},\\ ] ] where @xmath67    the order of the variables @xmath55 and @xmath68 in the conditional approach is a choice that is generally driven by the underlying science ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when more variables are involved , the order may not always be obvious , but , if the goal is to construct valid covariance and cross - covariance functions , the different orderings can be viewed as enlarging the space of valid models .",
    "any univariate covariance function , @xmath69 , that satisfies mild integrability conditions has a karhunen  love representation ( @xcite ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are orthogonal eigenvectors obtained by solving a fredholm integral equation .",
    "after truncation , the function , @xmath73 is still n.n.d .",
    "indeed , an equivalent way to write ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) is in terms of a spatial process , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a mean - zero random vector with @xmath76 .    because the original covariance has been truncated , one way to capture the lost covariation is to add back a simple random process : @xmath77    it is common to choose @xmath78 to be a white - noise process , but it is also straightforward to maintain some spatial structure in @xmath78 ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , the expression ( [ eq:3 - 3 ] ) could be thought of as a spatial - factor - analysis model ( @xcite ) , although there are important differences in what is assumed known and what is estimated .    the definition ( [ eq:3 - 3 ] )",
    "is directly expressed in terms of the random components of the model , and it is a very fertile way of constructing covariance functions : specifically , replace @xmath79 with any set of known basis functions @xmath80 , orthogonal or not ; replace @xmath81 with any @xmath82 positive definite ( p.d . ) matrix @xmath83 ; and write @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath85 is a valid nonstationary univariate covariance model , where @xmath86 .",
    "@xcite call this a spatial random effects ( sre ) model .",
    "the generalization of ( [ eq:3 - 4 ] ) to multivariate spatial processes is easiest to obtain from its expression in terms of random components . here , the bivariate case shows its potential : @xmath87 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber z_{2}(\\mathbf { s})&=&\\mathbf { s}^{(2)}(\\mathbf { s})^{\\prime}{\\bolds\\eta } _ { 2}+\\xi_{2}(\\mathbf { s}),\\quad \\mathbf { s}\\in d,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are given spatial basis functions that are quite likely to be different for @xmath52 and for @xmath90 , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 may have nonzero @xmath93 ; see @xcite . note that ( [ eq:3 - 5 ] ) could be viewed as an errors - in - variables parameterization ( christensenand amemiya , @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , the implied covariance and cross - covariance functions are nonstationary , but their parameters can still be estimated from the multivariate spatial data .",
    "representations using `` factor '' processes , such as in  ( [ eq:3 - 5 ] ) , generalize many of the constructions outlined in gk - section  2 .",
    "let @xmath94 be a set of independent univariate processes with mean @xmath95 , variance @xmath96 and stationary correlation functions @xmath97 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath98 are integrable kernels ; then a very general factor representation is @xmath99    the cross - covariances implied by ( [ eq:3 - 6 ] ) are @xmath100    clearly , asymmetry is present in all but the simplest cases , and the linear model of coregionalization in gk - section  2.1 is recovered by setting @xmath101 in ( [ eq:3 - 6 ] ) , where @xmath102 is the dirac delta function . the cross - covariance function given at the beginning of gk - section  2.2 is also recovered by setting @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "there are many familiar special cases , and the `` factor '' processes @xmath106 in ( [ eq:3 - 6 ] ) do not even need to be independent .",
    "in gk - section  6 , several bivariate spatial models are implemented on data describing pressure and temperature .",
    "gk compare these models and assess which ones are best able to capture the dependence within and between the processes .",
    "this may be the first time such an exercise has been carried out ; nevertheless , there are aspects of the analyses we would modify .",
    "first , the various models under consideration contain different numbers of free parameters .",
    "for example , the parsimonious matrn has six free parameters , while the nonstationary parsimonious matrn has several hundred . in this context",
    ", the log - likelihood does not provide a useful comparison of model fit .",
    "we suggest that the akaike information criterion ( aic ) and its corrected version ( aicc ) are preferable when the number of free parameters differ across models ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , the other summaries ( rmse and crps ) may not be indicative of model performance , since parameters estimated from the entire dataset were used . in our view , the flexibility , adaptabilityand utility of a model can only be assessed ( in the context of cross - validation ) using data that have not been used for parameter estimation .",
    "finally , as we mentioned earlier ( section  [ sec : s1 ] ) , the so - called nugget - effect matrix that consists of both measurement - error and micro - scale matrices needs to be modeled in both examples , and in the second example ( gk - section  6.2 ) the possibility of nondiagonal contributions should be considered .",
    "it is a big task to review multivariate geostatistics , and we appreciate that gk had limits on what they could cover .",
    "they selected a few topics that went beyond their core goal of reviewing cross - covariance functions and to some of these topics we add the following bibliographic notes .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) : recall from section  [ sec : s4 ] that , in the univariate setting , reduced - rank covariance functions are very useful for big spatial data : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a given @xmath109-dimensional @xmath110 vector of spatial basis functions , @xmath111 is an unknown @xmath82 p.d .",
    "matrix , and @xmath112 . in wikle",
    "s review of these rank-@xmath109 covariance models , he points out their computational advantages for spatial prediction .",
    "a generalization to multivariate covariance functions is straightforward ; see section  [ sec : s4 ] . when considering global , such as in remote sensing applications , the nonstationarity of these models is an advantage .",
    "the asymmetry in multivariate spatial processes may come from , say , preferable mineralization of metals in an ore body or deposition of lighter particulate matter in the environment .",
    "cross - covariance models should be able to detect such phenomena .",
    "the `` shifted - lag model '' is a natural way to capture sources of asymmetry and has a longer history than that indicated by the reference to @xcite in gk - section  5.1 , as illustrated by the following articles .            from the point of view of building covariance functions ,",
    "the temporal dimension could be viewed simply as an extra `` spatial '' dimension .",
    "however , an alternative approach , based on the dynamical evolution of spatial processes in time , often allows optimal prediction to be carried out without explicitly constructing covariance models .",
    "@xcite : this article uses conditional - probability modeling ( in space and time ) and reduced - rank models to achieve optimal spatio - temporal prediction .",
    "it bypasses the need for constructing spatio - temporal cross - covariance functions .",
    "@xcite : in much of this book , cross - covariance functions are considered as derivative measures , from scientifically interpretable dynamical ( multivariate ) spatial models ; see their pages 418425 .",
    "a hierarchical dynamical approach is taken that yields optimal spatio - temporal prediction directly , without having to pass through multivariate covariance - function modeling ."
