    "<S> for the two dimensional kinetic ising model at finite temperature , the local mean magnetisation @xmath0 , simply related to the fraction of time spent by a given spin in the positive direction , has a limiting distribution , singular at @xmath1 , the onsager spontaneous magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent of this singularity defines the persistence exponent @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also study first passage exponents associated to persistent large deviations of @xmath3 , and their temperature dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    _ submitted for publication to _    in this work we present a new approach to the study of persistence for systems undergoing phase ordering @xcite at finite temperature , which we shall illustrate on the case of the two dimensional ising model . in this approach persistence appears as a stationary property of the coarsening system , and the role of the onsager spontaneous magnetization at equilibrium @xmath4 is made apparent , thus revealing new fundamental features of phase ordering . </S>",
    "<S> it departs from previous approaches to finite temperature persistence @xcite , where these features did not appear .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a system of ising spins @xmath5 located at sites @xmath6 , started from a random initial condition , and evolving under the heat bath dynamics at fixed temperature below the critical temperature . at each time </S>",
    "<S> step a spin is picked at random , and updated with the probability @xmath7 where the sum runs over the neighbours of site @xmath8 . under this dynamics spins thermalize in their local environment . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the system coarsens , i.e. domains of opposite signs grow and , in the scaling regime , the system is statistically self similar , with only one single characteristic length scale , which is the size of a typical domain @xcite .    the question of persistence is to determine the fraction of space @xmath9 which remained in the same phase up to time @xmath10 @xcite ( or from time @xmath11 to time @xmath12 ) . for the two dimensional ising model at zero temperature , </S>",
    "<S> two phases coexist , corresponding to all spins equal to @xmath13 or all spins equal to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath9 is equivalently defined as the fraction of spins which did not flip up to time @xmath10 @xcite , i.e. which were not swept by an interface between domains of all spins @xmath13 or all spins @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical measurements indicate an algebraic decay @xmath15 , with @xmath16 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the definition of persistence at finite temperature below @xmath17 is more subtle to implement because one has to make clear what is meant by ` phase ' . </S>",
    "<S> by essence , in the coarsening process there is phase separation , each phase wanting to develop at the expense of the other . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore intuitive that the system , though perpetually out of equilibrium , tries to reach locally one of the two equilibrium phases , corresponding to @xmath1 , where @xmath18 is the onsager spontaneous magnetization at equilibrium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence in the scaling regime the average magnetization inside a domain measured on a scale of time small compared to the flipping time of the domain , should be close to the equilibrium magnetization at this temperature . </S>",
    "<S> coming back to persistence , the definition of @xmath9 should reflect , in one way or the other , the fact that a given point in space remained in a phase of average magnetization equal to @xmath1 up to time @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this intuitive analysis is confirmed by what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> the central point of our approach is to consider the statistics of the local mean magnetization simply related to the fraction of time spent by a spin in the positive direction in the limit of large times . </S>",
    "<S> this line of thought was already used in @xcite in the study of domain coarsening for the one dimensional ising model at zero temperature , or for the simple diffusion equation evolved from a random initial condition ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is that since persistence probes the past history of the system , a natural quantity to consider is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the spin at site @xmath8 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the length of time spent by the spin pointing upward ( downward ) , with @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the local mean magnetization is defined as @xmath24 for instance at zero temperature , the persistence probability @xmath9 is equal to @xmath25 since the event @xmath26 is identical to the event @xmath27 . since @xmath3 is a local quantity varying from site to site , one is naturally led to investigate the distribution of @xmath3 , @xmath28 for the one dimensional ising model at @xmath29 is was shown in @xcite by analytical arguments and numerical measurements that , when @xmath30 , @xmath31 converges to a limit distribution @xmath32 with density @xmath33 singular at @xmath34 with singularity exponent equal to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> it is for instance easy to show that , when @xmath30 , the limit of @xmath36 is a constant equal to @xmath37 , the laplace transform of the two - time correlation with respect to the variable @xmath38 , at argument equal to 1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result therefore provides a _ stationary _ definition of persistence at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for the diffusion equation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now address the same questions at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we first report on numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> =    figure 1 depicts the histogram of the density of @xmath3 at time @xmath39 for values of @xmath40 ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> already for such a short time , and for every temperature @xmath43 , the density is maximum around @xmath1 , the equilibrium magnetization ( [ eqons ] ) . at larger times and for @xmath44 , </S>",
    "<S> the density of @xmath3 becomes peaked around zero , i.e. the mean magnetization converges toward the average magnetization per spin @xmath45 , reflecting the fact that the system reaches equilibrium . at @xmath17 the peaking of the density of @xmath3 is observed to be very slow . </S>",
    "<S> finally at @xmath43 , @xmath31 converges , when @xmath30 , to a limit distribution @xmath32 with density @xmath46 given as in ( [ eqfm ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a limit law at finite temperature @xmath47 relies on the same arguments as for the zero temperature case . </S>",
    "<S> for instance the convergence of @xmath48 to a constant equal to @xmath37 still holds since it only relies on the existence of a scaling regime @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> =    the striking fact is that now the density concentrates on @xmath49 $ ] with an exponential decay with time of @xmath50 to @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the limit density is singular at @xmath1 , with a singularity exponent @xmath35 which defines the persistence exponent at temperature @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the question of the temperature dependence of persistence for @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest assumption is that , during the coarsening process , the scales of time between a short time regime and the scaling regime decouple , yielding the following relation between the moments of the limit distributions at @xmath40 and at zero temperature , @xmath51 implying the identity of the limit distributions , if @xmath3 is rescaled by @xmath4 , and as a consequence , the temperature independence of @xmath2 . this would be in agreement with the usual view that zero temperature is an attracting fixed point for the dynamics of phase ordering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eqm2 t ] ) is hard to check by numerical measurements because the convergence of the data is observed to be slow . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty is illustrated by figure 2 which depicts a plot of @xmath52 against the rescaled variable @xmath53 , at @xmath29 and @xmath54 , for @xmath55 , and at @xmath56 , for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> though one can not be conclusive on the sole basis of numerical measurements , data collapse seems nevertheless plausible . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that the limit distribution @xmath59 at @xmath29 is well approximated by a beta distribution , as was observed for the @xmath60 ising model @xcite , or for the diffusion equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the singularity exponent of the beta distribution is found to be around @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> a more precise numerical determination of the exponent @xmath2 from the limit distribution of @xmath3 needs further work and will be presented elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> let us summarize at this point . for @xmath43 , the local mean magnetization @xmath3 has a limit probability density when @xmath30 , defined on the interval @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath4 is the equilibrium magnetization , and singular at both ends . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a _ stationary _ definition of persistence , which is a natural extension of the zero temperature case , where the singularity exponent defines the persistence exponent . </S>",
    "<S> these are the central results of the present work .    </S>",
    "<S> =    another new aspect of persistence introduced in @xcite is concerned with _ persistent large deviations_. the probability of persistent large deviations above the level @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , denoted by @xmath64 , is defined as the probability that the mean magnetization was , for all previous times , greater than @xmath62 @xcite , @xmath65 in other words one is interested in the persistence probability of the stochastic process @xmath66 @xcite . if one views the stochastic process @xmath20 as the successive steps of a fictitious random walker , then @xmath3 is the mean speed of the walker between 0 and @xmath10 , and @xmath64 is the probability that this mean speed remained larger than @xmath62 between 0 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this probability is a natural generalization of the persistence probability @xmath67 , which corresponds for the walker to always stepping to the right .    for the one dimensional ising model at zero temperature , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 was observed to decay algebraically at large times with an exponent @xmath68 continuously varying with @xmath62 @xcite . for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , the usual persistence exponent . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 depicts a log - log plot of @xmath64 for the two dimensional ising model at zero temperature , @xmath62 varying from @xmath14 to @xmath71 , while figure 4 depicts the corresponding exponents @xmath68 , extracted from figure [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> let us mention that algebraic decay of @xmath64 was also observed for the diffusion equation @xcite , and that this quantity and the corresponding exponents @xmath68 can be exactly computed for the simple model considered in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> =    we now address the role of temperature for persistent large deviations . as is obvious from the first part of this work , if @xmath72 , then @xmath64 decays to zero exponentially rapidly . on the other hand , for @xmath73 one observes algebraic decay of @xmath64 , as at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise stated , @xmath74 separates two regimes of persistent large deviations , between exponential and algebraic . as a consequence , and by analogy with the zero temperature case , one could think of extracting the persistence exponent at finite temperature from the decay at large times of @xmath64 when @xmath75 , which leads to the formal definition @xmath76 however this definition is not easy to implement in practice .    </S>",
    "<S> =    we did not investigate the temperature dependence of @xmath68 in all generality . </S>",
    "<S> we restricted our study to the case @xmath77 which corresponds to @xmath78 we find that @xmath79 with @xmath80 for @xmath81 , after a crossover , @xmath82 takes the high temperature value @xmath83 while for @xmath43 it takes the low temperature value @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see figure 5 . ) </S>",
    "<S> the explanation of the value of @xmath82 for @xmath85 is simple . </S>",
    "<S> since spins are independent , identifying as above @xmath20 , the spin at site @xmath8 , to the steps of a fictitious one dimensional symmetric random walker , @xmath86 represents the probability that the walker did not cross the origin up to time @xmath10 , which is , as is well known , decaying as @xmath87 @xcite . for decreasing temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> spins become more correlated , hence the exponent @xmath82 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> note that the first passage exponent @xmath82 is defined for @xmath88 , i.e. even in absence of coarsening .    </S>",
    "<S> this work raises a number of questions . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , what is the temperature dependence of the two time correlation in the scaling regime , for @xmath43 ? is the hypothesis ( [ eqm2 t ] ) valid ? </S>",
    "<S> what is the behaviour of the distribution of @xmath3 at @xmath17 when @xmath30 ? at @xmath17 , is @xmath82 a new independent critical exponent , or is it related ( equal ? ) to the persistence exponent @xmath89 for the global magnetization @xcite ? </S>",
    "<S> let us mention that for the @xmath90 ising model the quantities studied here have similar behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in our view , an important point of the analysis presented here is that it may be applied to any coarsening system , since it relies mainly on scaling .    </S>",
    "<S> we wish to thank j - p bouchaud , i dornic and j - m luck for interesting discussions . </S>"
