    "the search for solar - like oscillations in other stars has been long and difficult .",
    "observers have mostly concentrated on three stars : procyon ( @xmath0  cmi ) , @xmath1  boo and @xmath0  cen  a. reviews of those efforts have been given by @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kb95 ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite measured balmer - line equivalent widths in @xmath0  cen  a and set an upper limit on oscillation amplitudes of only 1.4 times solar , with tentative evidence for p - mode structure . more recently still , measurements of velocity variations in procyon by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , showed very good evidence for oscillations with peak amplitudes of about 0.5and frequencies centred at about 1mhz .    here",
    ", we report the clear detection of excess power , providing evidence for oscillations in the g2 subgiant @xmath2  hydri ( hr  98 , @xmath3 , g2  iv ) .",
    "this star is the closest g - type subgiant , with luminosity 3.5@xmath4 , mass 1.1@xmath5 and age about 6.7gy @xcite .",
    "it has received less attention than the three stars mentioned above , presumably due to its extreme southerly declination ( @xmath6 ) . an attempt to measure oscillations in in radial velocity",
    "was made by @xcite and gave upper limits on the strongest modes of 1.5 to 2.0 , consistent with our detection .",
    "the observations were made over five nights ( 2000 june 1115 ) .",
    "we used the university college london echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) at the coud focus of the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) at siding spring observatory , australia . to produce high - precision velocity measurements ,",
    "the star was observed through an iodine absorption cell mounted directly in the telescope beam , immediately behind the spectrograph entrance slit .",
    "the cell is temperature - stabilized at 55@xmath70.1@xmath8c and imprints a rich forest of molecular iodine absorption lines from 500 nm to 600 nm directly on the incident starlight .",
    "echelle spectra were recorded with the mitll 2k@xmath94k 15@xmath10 m pixel ccd , denoted mitll2a , which covered the wavelength range 470880 nm .",
    "exposure times were typically 60s , with a dead - time of 55s between exposures ( using `` fast '' readout ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for most spectra was in the range 200 to 400 , depending on the seeing and extinction . in total , 1196 spectra were collected , with the following distribution over the five nights : 59 , 166 , 301 , 325 and 345 .",
    "the first two nights were affected by poor weather and technical problems .",
    "extraction of radial velocities from the echelle spectra followed the method described by @xcite .",
    "this involved using the embedded iodine lines both as a wavelength reference and also to recover the spectrograph point - spread - function .",
    "essential to this process were template spectra taken of with the iodine cell removed from the beam , and of the iodine cell itself superimposed on a rapidly rotating b - type star .",
    "the resulting velocity measurements for are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.ucles-time ] .",
    "they have been corrected to the solar system barycentre , as described by @xcite .",
    "no other corrections , decorrelation or high - pass filtering have been applied : the measurements are exactly as they emerged from the pipeline processing .",
    "note that the velocity measurements are relative to the velocity of the star when the template was taken .",
    "the slow variations in velocity within and between nights are due to uncorrected instrumental drifts .",
    "the rms scatter of these measurements is 3.30 .",
    "uncertainties for the velocity measurements were estimated from residuals in the fitting procedure and are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.ucles-time ] .",
    "most lie in the range 2.54 , and fall gradually during each night as the target rises in the sky .",
    "observations of were also made using the coralie spectrograph on the 1.2-m leonard euler swiss telescope at la silla observatory in chile @xcite .",
    "the precision of those measurements was poorer than those from ucles , presumably due  at least in part  to the smaller telescope aperture .",
    "the coralie data are not included in this letter ; their analysis is postponed to a future paper .",
    "the amplitude spectrum of the velocity time series was calculated as a weighted least - squares fit of sinusoids @xcite , with a weight being assigned to each point according its uncertainty estimate .",
    "figure  [ fig.ucles-power ] shows the resulting power spectrum . there is a striking excess of power around 1mhz which is the clear signature of solar - like oscillations .",
    "as discussed below , the frequency and amplitude of this excess power are in excellent agreement with expectations .",
    "we also note that the excess is apparent in the power spectra of individual nights .",
    "typically for such a power spectrum , the noise has two components :    1 .   at high frequencies it is flat ( i.e. , white ) , indicative of the poisson statistics of photon noise .",
    "the mean noise level in the amplitude spectrum in the range 35mhz is 0.11 .",
    "since this is based on 1196 measurements , we can calculate ( e.g. , kb95 ) that the velocity precision on the corresponding timescales is 2.2 . 2 .   towards the lowest frequencies ,",
    "we see rising power that arises from the slow drifts mentioned above .",
    "a logarithmic plot shows that , as expected for instrumental drift , this noise goes inversely with frequency in the amplitude spectrum ( and inversely with frequency squared in power ) .",
    "it has a value at 0.1mhz of 0.3 .    the white line in fig .",
    "[ fig.ucles-power ] shows the combined noise level , and we see that the contribution from @xmath11 noise is neglible above about 0.5mhz .",
    "mode frequencies for low - degree oscillations in the sun are reasonably well approximated by the asymptotic relation : @xmath12 here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are integers which define the radial order and angular degree of the mode , respectively ; @xmath15 ( the so - called large separation ) reflects the average stellar density , @xmath16 is sensitive to the sound speed near the core and @xmath17 is sensitive to the surface layers .",
    "note that @xmath16 is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the so - called small frequency separation between adjacent modes with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a similar relation to equation  ( [ eq.asymptotic ] ) is expected for other solar - like stars , although there may be significant deviations in more evolved stars .",
    "models of the g  subgiant suggest that modes with @xmath22 undergo ` avoided crossings , ' in which their frequencies are shifted from their usual regular spacing by effects of gravity modes in the stellar core @xcite .",
    "some evidence for this effect was seen in the proposed detection of oscillations in by @xcite .    in attempting to find peaks in our power spectrum matching the asymptotic relation , we were severely hampered by the single - site window function .",
    "as is well known , daily gaps in a time series produce aliases in the power spectrum at spacings @xmath23 which are difficult to disentangle from the genuine peaks .",
    "various methods have been discussed in the literature for searching for a regular series of peaks , such as autocorrelation , comb response and histograms of frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we use a type of comb analysis , in which we calculated a response function for all sensible values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "since we are searching for mode structure in the region of excess power , it is convenient to rewrite equation  ( [ eq.asymptotic ] ) as @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the frequency of a radial ( @xmath20 ) mode in the region of maximum power , for which @xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 replaces @xmath17 as the parameter for the absolute position of the comb .",
    "the comb response function was obtained as follows .",
    "we first thresholded the power spectrum at the noise level .",
    "in other words , any points less than the noise level were set at this level . for each triplet",
    "( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath25 ) we then measured the ( modified ) power spectrum at each of the frequencies predicted by equation  ( [ eq.asymptotic-mod ] ) .",
    "we summed these numbers to produce a response value which is a measure of the goodness - of - fit of that triplet .",
    "we limited the sum to @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , with @xmath25 centred at 1000 .",
    "the restriction on @xmath29 was made for two reasons : as in the sun , we only see modes excited to observable amplitudes over a restricted range of frequencies and , also as in the sun , we expect deviations from equation  ( [ eq.asymptotic-mod ] ) over large ranges in frequency .    from this analysis we identified the parameters that maximised the comb response , searching over the ranges @xmath15 = 4580 and @xmath16 = 0.52.0 .",
    "these ranges encompass the values that would be expected for this star . for @xmath25",
    ", we examined a range of width @xmath15 centred on 1000 .",
    "the following two triplets of ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath25 ) gave the best responses : ( 56.2 , 0.83 , 1030.1 ) ( solution  a ) and ( 60.3 , 0.75 , 1005.3 ) ( solution  b ) .",
    "the frequencies corresponding to these solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.ucles-freq ] , overlaid on the measured power spectrum .",
    "the distribution as a function of frequency of matches between calculated and observed peaks is not the same for the two solutions .",
    "the matches in solution  b occur mostly at the lower frequencies , while those for solution  a cover the full range of excess power .",
    "this suggests that solution  a is more likely to be the correct one .",
    "how do these two solutions agree with expectations for ?",
    "the large separation @xmath15 of a star scales approximately as the square root of density . extrapolating from the solar case ( @xmath30 ) using parameters for of @xmath31 , @xmath32k and @xmath33 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) gives @xmath34 .",
    "given that we searched over the entire range 4580 , the excellent agreement between observation and theory is very encouraging , especially for solution  a.    there is no simple way to estimate @xmath16 for a star as evolved as , since this parameter is very sensitive to evolution .",
    "extrapolating the grid calculated by @xcite leads us to expect @xmath16 in the range 0.5 to 1.0 , which is consistent with both solutions .",
    "the value of @xmath25 ( or , equivalently ,  @xmath17 ) depends on details of the surface layers , which also requires construction of models specifically for .",
    "we note that simulations in which input frequencies obeyed the asymptotic relation precisely showed a more definite ( and unambiguous ) peak in the comb response than did the real data .",
    "we conclude that the oscillation frequencies in have significant departures from the asymptotic relation .",
    "this is of great astrophysical interest and not unexpected , but it does make it very difficult to extract the correct frequencies from our single - site data .    at the suggestion of the referee , we examined the comb response of random power spectra that were generated by multiplying white noise by an envelope similar to the observed power excess . for these spectra",
    ", the comb response sometimes showed peaks similar to those from the real data , at various values of  @xmath35 .",
    "the comb analysis therefore does not prove that the excess power is due to individual modes .",
    "however , given ( i )  the agreement between observations and expectations in all respects  position and amplitude of excess power ( see below ) , and the best - fit value for  @xmath35  and ( ii )  the absence of any theoretical or observational reason to attribute the power excess to other sources , we consider that solar - like oscillations are the most likely explanation for the observed power excess .",
    "the strongest peaks in the amplitude spectrum of ( square root of power ) reach about 0.6 .",
    "however , these are likely to have been strengthened significantly by constructive interference with noise peaks .",
    "as stressed by kb95 ( appendix a.2 ) , the effects of the noise must be taken into account when estimating the amplitude of the underlying signal . to do this ,",
    "we have generated simulated time series consisting of artificial signal plus noise .",
    "we conclude that the underlying oscillations have peaks of about 0.5 .",
    "solar - like oscillations are excited by convection and the expected amplitudes have been estimated using theoretical models . based on models by @xcite",
    ", kb95 suggested that amplitudes in velocity should scale as @xmath36 .",
    "more recent calculations by @xcite confirm this scaling relation , at least for stars with near - solar effective temperatures . for , the implied amplitude is about 3.2 times solar , which is 0.7 to 0.8 ( based on the strongest few peaks  see kb95 ) .",
    "the observed amplitudes are therefore consistent with expectations .",
    "we also note that the frequency of excess power ( 1mhz ) is in excellent agreement with the value expected from scaling the acoustic cutoff from the solar case ( * ? ? ?",
    "our observations of show an obvious excess of power , clearly separated from the @xmath11 noise , and with a position and amplitude that are in agreement with expectations .",
    "although hampered by the single - site window , a comb analysis shows evidence for approximate regularity in the peaks at the spacing expected from asymptotic theory .",
    "there seem to be significant departures from regularity , perhaps indicating mode shifts from avoided crossings .",
    "we hope that further analysis along one or more of the following lines will allow us to explore further the oscillation spectrum of : including the coralie observations which , despite their lower precision , could usefully improve the spectral window ; reducing the noise of the velocity measurements ( ucles and coralie ) by decorrelating against external parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; combining these results with an analysis of equivalent - width variations of strong lines in the spectral region uncontaminated by iodine lines ( e.g. , h@xmath0 ) ; and using theoretical models to calculate expected shifts due to avoided crossings , to help identify the affected modes .",
    "the clear strength of the technique used in these observations is its ability to precisely calibrate spectrograph variations at the timescales of primary interest .",
    "although the best radial velocity precisions achieved in the _ long term _ from this technique are 34 , our data clearly demonstrate that the precision at frequencies around 1mhz is significantly better ( 2.2 ) .",
    "our results provide valuable confirmation that oscillations in solar - like stars really do have the amplitudes that we have been led to expect by extrapolating from the sun .",
    "this bodes extremely well for success of space missions such as most @xcite , mons @xcite and corot @xcite , which will provide photometric data of high quality for a wide sample of stars .",
