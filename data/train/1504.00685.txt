    ", it was appreciated that the superconducting state and the cdw state are both results of electron - phonon coupling often with the cdw state competing with and ultimately replacing the superconducting state as electron - phonon coupling is increased . in some , relatively rare , compounds both transitions can be found upon cooling ; more often , though , a cdw or some other type of structural phase transition removes density of states at the fermi surface and thus suppresses or even precludes the formation of a superconducting state .",
