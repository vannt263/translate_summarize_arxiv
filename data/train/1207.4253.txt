    "quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of black - hole spacetimes are the characteristic modes of linear perturbations of black holes that satisfy an outgoing boundary condition at infinity and an ingoing boundary condition at the horizon ( they are the natural , resonant modes of black - hole perturbations ) .",
    "these oscillatory and decaying modes are represented by complex characteristic frequencies @xmath1 , which are typically indexed by three numbers , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the overtone number @xmath2 is proportional to the decay rate of the perturbation , and @xmath0 and @xmath3 are multipolar indexes of the angular eigenfunctions of the qnm .      since their discovery , numerically , in the scattering of gravitational waves in the schwarzschild spacetime by vishveshwara @xcite , qnms",
    "have been thoroughly studied in a wide range of spacetimes , and they have found many applications .",
    "there are several reviews @xcite that summarize the many discoveries about qnms .",
    "they describe how qnms are defined , the many methods used to calculate qnms ( e.g. , estimating them from time - domain solutions @xcite , using shooting methods in frequency - domain calculations @xcite , approximating them with inverse - potential approaches @xcite and wkb methods @xcite , and numerically solving for them with continued - fraction techniques @xcite ) , and the ways to quantify the excitation of qnms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they also discuss the prospects for detecting them in gravitational waves using interferometric gravitational - wave detectors , such as ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite , and for inferring astrophysical information from them ( see , e.g. , @xcite for finding the mass and spin of black holes using qnms , @xcite for quantifying the excitation of qnms in numerical - relativity simulations binary - black - hole mergers , and @xcite for testing the no - hair theorem with qnms ) .",
    "there have also been several other recent applications of qnms .",
    "for example , zimmerman and chen @xcite ( based on work by mino and brink @xcite ) study extensions to the usual spectrum of modes generated in generic ringdowns .",
    "dolan and ottewill use eikonal methods to approximate the modal wave function , and they use these functions to study the green s function and to help understand wave propagation in the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .    although qnms are well - understood and can be calculated quite precisely , it remains useful to develop intuitive and analytical descriptions of these modes .",
    "an important calculation in this direction was performed by ferrari and mashhoon @xcite , who showed that for a schwarzschild black hole , the qnm frequency ( which depends only on a multipolar index @xmath0 and an overtone index @xmath2 ) can be written in the eikonal ( or geometric - optics ) limit , @xmath4 , as @xmath5 the quantities @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the keplerian frequency of the circular photon orbit and the lyapunov exponent of the orbit , the latter of which characterizes how quickly a congruence of null geodesics on the circular photon orbit increases its cross section under infinitesimal radial perturbations @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ mashoonfreq ] ) hints at an intriguing physical description of qnms : for modes with wavelengths much shorter than the background curvature , the mode behaves as if it were sourced by a perturbation that orbits on and diffuses away from the light ring on the time scale of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "ferrari and mashhoon @xcite also derived an analogous result to eq .   for slowly rotating black holes .",
    "they showed for @xmath8 , the real part of the frequency is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is now the keplerian orbital frequency for the circular photon orbit and @xmath11 is the lense - thiring - precession frequency of the orbit ( which arises because of the slow rotation of the black hole ) .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath11 also has a simple geometric - optics interpretation .",
    "inertial frames near the high - frequency wave at the light ring are dragged with respect to inertial frames at infinity , and this frame dragging causes the perturbation s orbit to precess about the spin axis of the black hole with a frequency , @xmath11 .",
    "if the orbit is inclined at an angle of @xmath12 ( the ratio of angular momenta @xmath13 for quantized waves in flat space ) , then the projection of the precessional velocity onto the orbital plane scales the precessional frequency by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "why the qnm frequency is multiplied by @xmath15 is a feature that we will explain in greater detail in this paper . intuitively , this term arises because the in the high - frequency limit , any wavefront traveling on null orbits will have an integral number of oscillations in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions . for the wave to be periodic and single - valued , there must be @xmath3 oscillations in the @xmath17 direction . for the @xmath16 direction , it is a bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition that requires @xmath18 oscillations in this direction , which implies that there should be a net spatial frequency of roughly @xmath15 .",
    "this increases the frequency of the radiation seen far from the hole by the same factor .    from this intuitive argument",
    ", we expect that the real part of the mode should be @xmath19 where we define @xmath20 . in this paper",
    ", we will show that an equation of the form of eq .",
    "( [ freqsum ] ) does , in fact , describe the qnm frequencies of kerr black holes of arbitrary astrophysical spins ( and it recovers the result of ferrari and mashhoon for slowly spinning black holes ) . as we mention in the next part of this section ,",
    "the exact details of the correspondence between qnms and photon orbits is richer for rapidly rotating black holes than for slowly rotating or static black holes .          to derive eq .",
    "requires that we develop a geometric - optics interpretation of the qnms of kerr black holes with arbitrary astrophysical spins .",
    "finding the correspondence requires two steps : first , we need to calculate the approximate frequencies using the wkb method ; next , we must articulate a connection between the mathematics of waves propagating in the kerr spacetime in the geometric - optics approximation and those of the wkb approximation ( the first step ) .",
    "finally , with the geometric - optics description of qnms , we can make a physical interpretation of the spectrum ( for example , the degeneracy or the lack of damping in the extremal limit ) .",
    "[ sec : wkb ] , we describe how we solve the eigenvalue problem that arises from separating the teukolsky equation @xcite ( a linear partial differential equation that describes the evolution of scalar , vector , and gravitational perturbations of kerr black holes ) into two nontrivial linear ordinary differential equations .",
    "the two differential equations , the radial and angular teukolsky equations , share two unknown constants  the frequency , @xmath21 , and the angular separation constant , @xmath22that are fixed by the boundary conditions that the ordinary differential equations must satisfy ( ingoing at the horizon and outgoing at infinity for the radial equation , and well - behaved at the poles for the angular equation ) .",
    "the goal of the wkb method is to compute the frequency and separation constant approximately .",
    "although there has been work by kokkotas @xcite and iyer and seidel @xcite using wkb methods to compute qnm frequencies of rotating black holes , their results were limited to slowly rotating black holes , because they performed an expansion of the angular separation constant , @xmath22 , for small , dimensionless spin parameters , @xmath23 , and only applied the wkb method to the radial teukolsky equation to solve for the frequency . in a different approach , dolan developed a matched - expansion formalism for kerr black holes of arbitrary spins that can be applied to compute the frequency of qnms , but only for modes with @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it remains an outstanding problem to compute a wkb approximation to the quasinormal modes of kerr black holes of large spins and for any multipolar index @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wkb ] , we solve the joint eigenvalue problem of the radial and angular teukolsky equations by applying a change of variables to the angular equation that brings it into the form of a bound - state problem in quantum mechanics . applying the wkb method to the angular equation , we arrive at a bohr - sommerfeld condition that constrains the angular constant in terms of the frequency ( and the indices @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "simultaneously , we can analyze the radial equation in the wkb approximation , and the two equations together define an system of integral equations , which can be solved for the eigenvalues .",
    "when we expand the bohr - sommerfeld condition in a taylor series in terms of the numerically small parameter , @xmath26 , the system of integral equations reduces to an algebraic system ( which , in turn , leads to a simpler expression for the frequency ) .",
    "the approximate frequency agrees very well with the result that includes all powers of @xmath26 , and , in the eikonal limit , it is accurate to order @xmath27 for kerr black holes of arbitrary spins , for modes with any value of @xmath3 , and for both the real and the imaginary parts of the frequency .    to interpret the wkb calculation of sec .",
    "[ sec : wkb ] in the language of propagating waves in the geometric - optics limit within the kerr spacetime , we analyze waves around a kerr black hole in sec .",
    "[ sec : geomoptics ] using the geometric - optics approximation and the hamilton - jacobi formalism .",
    "we confirm that the leading - order pieces of the wkb frequencies and angular constants correspond to the conserved quantities of the leading - order , geodesic behavior of the geometric - optics approximation ( specifically , the real part of @xmath21 , the index @xmath3 , and the real part of @xmath22 are equivalent to the energy @xmath28 , the z - component of the specific angular momentum @xmath29 , and carter s constant @xmath30 plus @xmath31 , respectively ) .",
    "the specific geodesics corresponding to a qnm are , in fact , spherical photon orbits .",
    "the next - to - leading - order wkb quantities ( the imaginary parts of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) correspond to dispersive , wavelike corrections to the geodesic motion ( they are the lyapunov exponent and the product of this exponent with the change in carter s constant with respect to the energy ) . table [ tb : geomatch ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : geomoptics ] summarizes this geometric - optics correspondence .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] , we make several observations about features of the qnm spectrum of kerr black holes that have simple geometric interpretations .",
    "first , we find that for extremal kerr black holes , a significant fraction of the qnms have a real frequency proportional to the angular frequency of the horizon and a decay rate that rapidly falls to zero ; we explain this in terms of a large number of spherical photon orbits that collect on the horizon for extremal kerr holes .",
    "second , we expand the wkb expression for the real part of the frequency as in eq .  , and we interpret these terms as an orbital and a precessional frequency of the corresponding spherical photon orbit .",
    "these two frequencies depend on the spin of the black hole and the value of @xmath32 very weakly for slowly - rotating black holes , though quite strongly when the spin of the black hole is nearly extremal . finally , we use the geometric - optics interpretation given by eq . to explain a degeneracy in the qnm spectrum of kerr black holes , in the eikonal limit , which also manifests itself , approximately , for small @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ numdeg ] ) .",
    "the degeneracy occurs when the orbital and precession frequencies , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are rationally related ( i.e. , @xmath33 for integers @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) for a hole of a specific spin parameter , and when the corresponding spherical photon orbits close . by substituting this result into eq .",
    "( [ freqsum ] ) one can easily see that modes with multipolar indexes @xmath0 and @xmath3 become degenerate with those of indexes @xmath36 and @xmath37 for any non - negative integer @xmath38 , in the eikonal limit ( note that in fig .  [ numdeg ] , we show an approximate degeneracy for @xmath39 and for three spin parameters , such that @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively . )    to conclude this introduction , we briefly summarize the organization of this paper : in sec .",
    "[ sec : wkb ] , we review the teukolsky equations , and we then describe the wkb formalism that we use to calculate an accurate approximation to the angular eigenvalues @xmath43 and qnm frequencies @xmath1 , in the eikonal limit @xmath44 and for holes of arbitrary spins .",

[",
    "sec : spectra ] , we interpret aspects of the qnm spectrum geometrically , such as the vanishing of the damping rate for many modes of extremal black holes , the decomposition of the frequency into orbital and precessional parts , and the degeneracies in the qnm frequency spectrum . finally , in sec .",

    "furthermore , the angular equation is now in a form that is amenable to a wkb analysis ( which will be the subject of the next part ) .",
