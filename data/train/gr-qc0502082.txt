    "in the study of cosmology many questions remain unanswered despite the wealth of observational data at hand . in particular our understanding of the early universe",
    "is lacking .",
    "it is at these high energies that any classical cosmological models are no longer relevant and a quantum theory of gravity is needed . a deep quantum understanding of the regime is required to answer , for instance , questions related to the initial big - bang singularity and to understand what conditions preceded the onset of chaotic inflation .",
    "a particularly exciting quantum theory of cosmology is known as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) ( for a review and references see @xcite ) .",
    "the progress made in lqc to date has been impressive .",
    "lqc has provided explanations to long standing questions in quantum cosmology .",
    "the reason for its success can be traced to the fact that it has as its basis a candidate full theory of quantum gravity known as loop quantum gravity ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "thus lqc is expected to handle on a firmer basis the extreme high energy regime of the early universe where non - perturbative effects are paramount .",
    "for instance it has been shown that the theory contains a robust mechanism for singularity avoidance @xcite .",
    "the mechanism arises as a natural feature of the theory and does not rely on ad - hoc forms of matter .",
    "this is in contrast to earlier forms of quantum cosmology such as those based on wheeler - dewitt quantization where singularity avoidance does not arise naturally .    yet",
    ", an even more exciting result is that lqc predicts modifications to the evolution of the universe for scales larger than the planck scale .",
    "for instance it has been shown that lqc can modify the behavior of the inverse volume such that it becomes a bounded function @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to modifications to the behavior of matter in the form of a scalar field which in turn predicts a period of super - inflation at energies near the planck scale @xcite . in this super - inflationary regime",
    "the inflaton is pushed up its potential due to the existence of an anti - friction term in the klein - gordon equation which can set the stage for the onset of slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "the modified dynamics in this regime can even lead to measurable signatures at large scales in the cmb @xcite .",
    "most of the phenomenological studies to date have exploited the modification of the inverse volume . for instance , in a collapsing universe with a scalar field the anti - frictional term in the klein - gordon equation becomes frictional and a bounce can occur @xcite .",
    "this effect has been studied for a scalar field with a self - interaction potential in positive curvature oscillatory universes where the effects of repeated expansion / contraction push the scalar field up its potential providing another mechanism to establish the initial conditions for slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "in addition the modifications can lead to a bounce in the context of cyclic models with colliding branes , possibly removing singular behavior that has plagued these models @xcite .",
    "these results are intriguing yet some open questions remain as to their validity . the modifications to the inverse volume",
    "arise by exploiting an ambiguity in defining the inverse volume operator which is required to quantize the matter part of the hamiltonian constraint for a scalar field . in defining the inverse volume operator",
    "one traces over su(2 ) valued holonomies and the ambiguity lies in choosing the irreducible representation in which to perform the trace .",
    "the ambiguity is labeled by a half - integer @xmath0 representing the spin of the representation .",
    "a neglected fact is that this same ambiguity arises in the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint where one also traces over su(2 ) valued holonomies .",
    "so far , the gravitational part of the constraint has been quantized using the @xmath1 representation while the ambiguity has been freely exploited for the matter part .",
    "it is therefore not clear if corrections arising in the gravitational part might change the dynamics and alter significantly the phenomenological consequences . from the full theory",
    "the gravitational part contains an inverse volume factor and the possibility remains that modifications here might cancel the effects in the matter part .",
    "it is thus of critical importance to determine the complete quantum corrections for arbitrary @xmath0 arising in both terms of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "in this paper we aim to clear up the uncertainty with respect to this ambiguity .",
    "we explicitly construct the isotropic hamiltonian constraint operator for arbitrary spin @xmath0 representations .",
    "we show that the resulting difference equation is higher order for larger @xmath0 and that geometric quantities in the gravitational part of the constraint obtain quantum modifications analogously to the inverse volume modifications for the matter part .",
    "we show that the higher @xmath0 constraint operator contains the same singularity resolution mechanism attesting to its robustness",
    ". we will derive and motivate effective semi - classical equations of motion from the constraint operator and comment on the phenomenological consequences and show that the qualitative results do not change . as an explicit example",
    ", the @xmath2 constraint operator is constructed and analyzed with special attention payed to the semi - classical limit .",
    "we start with a brief overview of lqc and its kinematical hilbert space . in dirac quantization for systems with constraints ( such as general relativity )",
    "one first starts by constructing a kinematical hilbert space by quantizing the system ignoring the constraints .",
    "the constraints are then represented as self - adjoint operators on this space and physical solutions are wave functions annihilated by the constraint operators . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to homogeneous and isotropic models with zero spatial curvature . upon the imposition of this symmetry reduction , the hamiltonian of isotropic gr consists of a single constraint , the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the details of the construction of the kinematical hilbert space and the constraint operator are given in @xcite .",
    "we will follow the same conventions and notation here .",
    "the first step toward quantization is a classical symmetry reduction of the action of general relativity written in connection form . in the full theory of loop quantum gravity",
    "the action is written in terms of a connection @xmath3 which contains the information about curvature , as well as a triad @xmath4 conjugate to @xmath3 which encodes the geometry .",
    "after reduction to homogeneity and isotropy the connection and triad are labeled by single quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "these variables satisfy the commutation relation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the barber - immirzi parameter which represents a quantum ambiguity ( black hole entropy calculations can fix its value to @xmath10 @xcite ) . in terms of the standard metric variables given by the scale factor @xmath11 ,",
    "the new variables are related as    @xmath12    note the absence of the factor of @xmath13 in the formula for the connection ( [ c ] ) which appears in @xcite .",
    "the correct factor ( without the @xmath13 ) can be derived using the relation from the full theory @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the full connection , @xmath16 is the extrinsic curvature , and @xmath17 is the spin connections which vanishes identically for isotropic flat models .",
    "the absolute value around the triad component @xmath6 indicates that we are extending the classical phase space of isotropic gr to include both orientations of the triad ( positive and negative @xmath6 ) . note that this does not mean that negative @xmath6 corresponds to a negative scalar factor . for both regions the scale factor , and hence the volume , is positive .",
    "dynamics is determined completely by the hamiltonian constraint @xmath18 given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the matter hamiltonian .",
    "note again the factor of @xmath21 which differs from previous works . with the correct factors here the resulting action @xmath22 is equivalent to the standard isotropic einstein - hilbert action @xmath23 , and the hamiltonian equations @xmath24 and @xmath25 are equivalent to the equations of motion derived from the einstein - hilbert action .    with the symmetry reduced action we now turn to quantization .",
    "the theory is quantized using ideas and techniques from the full theory of loop quantum gravity .",
    "the basic variables to be quantized are holonomies of the connection and the smeared triad integrated on a two - surface . using this",
    ", the quantum configuration space inherits a discrete structure and an _ orthonormal _ basis is given by states labeled by a parameter @xmath26 given by @xmath27 the basis states @xmath28 are eigenstates of the triad operator @xmath29 with eigenvalues @xmath30 geometric operators are built from the triad , which allows us to understand the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath26 . in particular it is an eigenstate of the volume operator @xmath31 hence the physical volume is given by @xmath32    more complicated operators are built from the basic triad operator @xmath29 and holonomy operators . because of homogeneity and isotropy we only need consider holonomies along straight lines which can be parameterized as @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the generators of the lie algebra of su(2 ) satisfying @xmath35 = \\epsilon^k_{ij } \\tau_k$ ] , and @xmath36 is proportional to the length of the holonomy . in the fundamental representation",
    "the holonomies are given by the simple formula @xmath37 where the notation @xmath38 indicates that the holonomy is defined in the fundamental representation ( @xmath1 ) . in this paper",
    "we will use superscripts to the left of an object to indicate the irreducible representation of su(2 ) used .",
    "the holonomy operators in turn behave as exponentiated position operators and thus act on the basis states by finite shifts .",
    "more precisely , the holonomy operators consist of the cosine and sine operators which we will for compactness notate @xmath39 and @xmath40 with actions @xmath41      \\nonumber \\\\",
    "{ \\widehat{\\text{sn}}}\\;{{| \\mu \\rangle}}&\\equiv & \\sin\\left ( \\frac{\\mu_0 \\hat{c}}{2 } \\right ) { { | \\mu \\rangle}}= -\\frac{i}{2 } \\big [ { | \\mu+\\mu_0 \\rangle}- { | \\mu-\\mu_0 \\rangle } \\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    knowing the action of the holonomy operators let us now turn to two essential operators : the inverse volume and the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the inverse volume operator is needed to quantize certain forms of matter , for instance a scalar field .",
    "since the eigenstates of the volume operator are normalizable , the naive inverse volume operator ( with eigenvalues equal to the inverse of the volume eigenvalues ) is not a densely designed self - adjoint operator .",
    "the solution is to recast the classical formula for the inverse volume using the poisson bracket between the connection and the volume @xcite .",
    "when quantized the connection is represented with a holonomy operator , and the poisson bracket is replaced with a commutator .",
    "the resulting operator is diagonal in the @xmath28 basis and is given by @xcite @xmath42 ^ 6 { { | \\mu \\rangle}}\\,.\\ ] ] the eigenvalues are in fact bounded and approach zero near the classical singularity @xmath43 .",
    "the fact that the inverse volume is cutoff for small volumes is the principal reason for the period of super - inflation for a scalar field in the early universe .",
    "we will discuss this more later .",
    "there are two important points we wish to make regarding the inverse volume operator given here .",
    "first , as noted the formula is obtained using traces of holonomies in the spin @xmath13 representation .",
    "the generalization to higher @xmath0 has been performed @xcite and the effect is that the cutoff region gets pushed to larger volumes for larger @xmath0 allowing for phenomenological modifications for scales larger than the planck length ( the cutoff for @xmath1 is deep in the planckian regime where semi - classical equations of motion are no longer expected to be valid ) .",
    "most of the phenomenological investigations are based on the modifications for larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "the second point we make is that the holonomy operators ( [ hops ] ) involve the length parameter @xmath36 and an implicit value of @xmath44 has been used to arrive at equation ( [ dj1/2 ] ) .",
    "as stated in @xcite one can use an arbitrary value @xmath36 in the regularization and in that reference the hamiltonian constraint is constructed using a value of @xmath45 determined on physical grounds from the smallest allowed area of the full theory of lqg .",
    "it is natural that the same value should be used both for the hamiltonian constraint and the inverse volume operator since both are regularized using holonomies .",
    "we would like to update the formulas for the inverse volume operator to account for this ambiguity and in the next section we will do so .",
    "finally we wish to represent the hamiltonian constraint operator , classically given in equation ( [ hclass ] ) .",
    "there are two important non - trivialities that arise when attempting to quantize the constraint .",
    "the first is that the connection parameter @xmath5 is no longer one of the basic variables and must be represented using the holonomy operators .",
    "the other important non - triviality deals with how the @xmath46 term of the constraint gets quantized from the full theory . while this term in the isotropic constraint could be simply quantized using the @xmath6 operator ( [ pmu ] )",
    ", this approach is not possible in the full theory .",
    "there the full constraint is given by @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the lapse , @xmath49 is the curvature of the connection , @xmath50 is the determinant of the three - metric , and the dots indicate the lorentzian part of the constraint in which we are not interested at this point ( upon symmetry reduction it is proportional to the first half of the constraint ) . most important is the presence of the @xmath51 term which leads to the @xmath46 in the symmetry reduced action , but involves inverse triad operators in the full theory .",
    "thus as for the inverse volume this term is represented using a commutator between the volume operator and holonomies .",
    "we will see that for higher @xmath0 this terms acquires quantum modifications for small volume analogously to the inverse volume operator .",
    "the resulting operator is given by @xmath52 \\right ) \\,.\\ ] ] where we have explicitly indicated that the trace is performed in the fundamental representation .",
    "the curvature term of the classical constraint ( @xmath53 ) has been regulated with holonomies taken around a closed loop ( the @xmath54 term ) .",
    "the @xmath46 term is now represented as @xmath55 $ ] in the constraint operator .",
    "several key remarks are to be made .",
    "first , the holonomy length parameter @xmath36 has been introduced explicitly with the term in the denominator and in the holonomy operators .",
    "second , a factor ordering has been chosen in that the @xmath56 term has been ordered to the right of the curvature term .",
    "this ordering is crucial in the singularity removal mechanism as we shall see .",
    "however , through this choice in ordering , the constraint is not self - adjoint .",
    "appropriate self - adjoint constraints built from ( [ hop12 ] ) have been proposed @xcite which have been shown to be non - singular . in this paper",
    "we will consider the non self - adjoint spin @xmath0 constraint though we note that self - adjoint constraints can be constructed in an analogous way which does not effect the results presented here .    using this formula we can now determine the action of the constraint operator on the basis states @xmath28 . using the formulas for the holonomies in the fundamental representation ( [ hops ] ) we get @xmath57\\ ] ]",
    "whose action on the basis states is @xmath58 \\ , .\\ ] ]    to understand the singularity removal mechanism we need to consider physical wave functions which are those annihilated by the constraint operator .",
    "such states can be expanded using the basis states as @xmath59 . imposing the constraint equation leads to a difference equation for the coefficients @xmath60 @xmath61 = -\\widehat{h}_{m } ( \\mu ) \\ , \\psi_{\\mu }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the matter constraint @xmath62 acts diagonally on the basis states .",
    "the key fact about singularity removal is that the wave function coefficient @xmath63 corresponding to the value of the wave functions at the classical singularity decouples from the difference equation .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the @xmath64 factor that always accompanies @xmath63 on the lhs of the difference equation vanishes .",
    "the singularity is then absent provided the matter side of the constraint annihilates the @xmath65 state . this has been shown to be true for various forms of matter including a scalar field .",
    "let us understand the singularity removal mechanism on a more general level .",
    "the key observation is that the constraint operator _ annihilates _ the @xmath65 state since @xmath64 vanishes identically for @xmath43 in equation ( [ hbas ] ) .",
    "let us assume in general that the constraint operator acts by raising and lowering the basis states @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are parameters depending on the details of the operator . assuming this , the difference equations for the components @xmath60 will be @xmath69 for all values of @xmath26 .",
    "the statement that the constraint operator annihilates the @xmath65 state implies that @xmath70 .",
    "in the difference equation the @xmath63 component is always accompanied with the @xmath71 term and thus decouples .",
    "had the @xmath56 been ordered to the left of the curvature term , the constraint operator would not annihilate the @xmath65 state and the singularity would not decouple .",
    "we would now like to generalize the calculation of the hamiltonian constraint operator ( [ hop12 ] ) and the inverse volume operator to arbitrary irreducible representations labeled by spin @xmath0 . that this ambiguity is possible in the full theory",
    "was first elaborated in @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is what effective semi - classical equations of motion can be inferred from the constraint operator and what phenomenological differences can arise from the modifications . after constructing the arbitrary spin @xmath0 constraint operator and inverse volume operator",
    ", we will give an explicit construction of the @xmath2 constraint operator and the resulting difference equation will be investigated .",
    "following that , we will propose effective classical equations of motion and bounds on their validity .",
    "let us propose the generalization of the formula of ( [ hop12 ] ) and show that it is a proper representation of the classical hamiltonian constraint ( [ hclass ] ) .",
    "the formula is @xmath72 we can restore the classical constraint by considering the limit as @xmath36 goes to zero .",
    "the holonomies are given by @xmath73 from which we find @xmath74 now using the formula @xmath75 we get @xmath76 from which we recover the classical expression given in ( [ hclass ] ) .",

    "we need expressions for the matrix elements of the holonomies in the spin @xmath0 representations in order to perform the trace .",
    "fortunately such formulas do exist and a particular form we will use is    [ holonomies ] @xmath78    where the matrix elements @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath80 and @xmath81 are constant coefficients given by @xmath82!\\ ;   [ j-{\\frac{1}{2}}(m+n+s)]!\\ ;      [ { \\frac{1}{2}}(m - n+s)]!\\ ; [ { \\frac{1}{2}}(n - m+s ) ] ! \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the index @xmath83 in the sum increments by two which implies that if @xmath84 is an even number , the sum over @xmath83 will comprise even values and vice versa .",
    "we can see that the holonomy operators are more complicated sums and products of the basic sine and cosine operators whose action is given in equations ( [ hops ] ) .",
    "hence , the holonomies have a well - defined action on the basis states @xmath28 .    with the formula for the holonomies ( [ holonomies ] ) we now can determine the action of the constraint operator .",

    "since @xmath85 $ ] has diagonal matrix elements we need only consider the diagonal elements @xmath90 when performing the trace .",

    "second , as we have stated since the s parameters increment by two , their evenness is determined by the parameters @xmath99 , thus for instance if @xmath100 is even then @xmath101 is even .",
    "we now show that the coefficients satisfy the following :    @xmath102    to show ( [ zodd ] ) we note that if @xmath103 is odd then this implies that @xmath104 is also odd . however , this quantity is equal to zero and hence even . thus @xmath92 must be even and @xmath105 for @xmath92 odd .",
    "( [ z0 ] ) can be shown by calculating @xmath106 explicitly .",

    "the action of this operator on the basis states @xmath28 can be understood as follows .",
    "we showed that the term @xmath119 acts diagonally on the basis states and in the next section we will show that it approximates the @xmath56 term in the classical constraint .",
    "the @xmath120 and @xmath121 terms each raise and lower the basis states by discrete steps up to @xmath122 . since the sum is over even powers of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , @xmath123 will raise and lower the basis states by even values of @xmath36 .",
    "thus in general we can say the action on the basis states is @xmath124 where @xmath125 are coefficients determined by equation ( [ hjop ] ) .",

    "the constraint will thus contain the following term @xmath131 whose action on the basis states contributes a @xmath132 term .",
    "it is easy to see that this vanishes for @xmath43 and hence the singularity decouples from the difference equation .",

    "next we would like to examine the local stability of the difference equation .",
    "since the difference equation is of higher order than the second order wheeler - dewitt equation , we must determine the behavior of the spurious solutions .",
    "as determined in @xcite , if the higher order difference equation admits solutions with amplitudes that grow ( locally ) , then the difference equation is not locally stable and this might call into the question the validity of the quantization as any semi - classical solutions would quickly become dominated by the expanding spurious solutions .",
    "let us be more precise .",
    "we will consider the large volume limit in a regime where the matter contribution is small .",
    "we assume that the volume is large enough such that the variations of @xmath165 and @xmath166 are small .",
    "we can thus approximate the difference equation by one with constant coefficients @xmath167 where we assume that on the order of @xmath168 that @xmath169 is constant .",
    "the difference equation with constant coefficients can be solved exactly by assuming solutions of the form @xmath170 where @xmath171 .",
    "the condition of local stability states that we should consider solutions of the homogeneous equation ( with @xmath172 ) and that the difference equation is locally stable if all solutions have norm equal to one , that is @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "this will guarantee that spurious solutions which do nt approximate a semi - classical wheeler - dewitt solution will not come to dominate .    plugging in our ansatz @xmath170 to the homogeneous difference equation ( [ diffconst ] ) we find",
    "the following condition on @xmath174 @xmath175 a numerical calculation of the roots shows that there are solutions with norms greater than one , thus the @xmath2 difference equation is _ not _ locally stable .",
    "the result of this behavior is plotted in figure ( [ j1instab ] ) for a massless scalar field with constant momentum where @xmath176 .",
    "the figure shows a solution to the difference equation ( [ diffeqn1 ] ) and a solution to the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wdeqn ] ) for comparison .",
    "initial conditions are specified on @xmath60 to match the wheeler - dewitt solution and the solution is evolved forward using the difference equation .",
    "it is clear that the solution of the difference equation follows the wheeler - dewitt solution briefly , after which the spurious non semi - classical solutions quickly dominate the wave function .",
    "the presence of the ill behaved spurious solutions does not by itself represent a problem with the quantization . to truly determine the physical consequence requires a detailed understanding of the physical inner product . with a physical inner product",
    ", one could identify which solutions are physical based on the notion of probability , that is unphysical solutions would have either vanishing or infinite physical norm and would be modded out of the physical hilbert space .",
    "an exampled where this happens is in the symmetry reduced plebanski model of @xcite . there",
    ", extra solutions have zero physical norm and the resulting physical hilbert space is one dimensional for matter in the form of a cosmological constant . if the spurious solutions here do indeed have zero physical norm then the quantization presented would have the correct semi - classical limit . if not this would indicate the need for different quantizations or even the possibility that the higher spin quantizations do not represent consistent quantizations of isotropic lqc .",
    "this might indicate a preference of the quantum theory toward the use of the fundamental representation for defining the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "there are possible indications that this behavior also occurs in the full theory where a large set of spurious solutions exist for the higher @xmath0 gravitational constraint operator @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the question of what sort of semi - classical equations of motion can be inferred from the constraint operator given in equation ( [ hjop ] ) . while in general the effective equations of motion should be derived from the wave function solutions themselves ( for instance by finding semi - classical states ) , here we will take the simplest route .",
    "our motivation comes from the path integral quantization of lqc where a discretized path integral involves integration over a classical action ( for details on the path integral derivation see @xcite ) . a detailed derivation of the path integral shows that the effective classical hamiltonian constraint is given by the p - q symbol @xmath177 .",
    "since the hamiltonian constraint of lqc consists of a self - adjoint part ( the @xmath178 term ) of which @xmath179 is an eigenstate , and a part ( @xmath180 ) of which @xmath181 is an eigenstate we need only consider the eigenvalues of the two operators to get an effective classical constraint written in terms of a classical @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we note that a more detailed consideration involving semi - classical states could lead to additional corrections .",
    "equations of motion can then be derived from the effective hamiltonian through the hamiltonian equations @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "we are interested in determining what modifications arise for instance to the friedmann equations from the quantum effects .",
    "we now show that two kinds of corrections arise in the effective constraint .",
    "the first occurs for small volumes and arises from the @xmath180 term which we will show behaves as a modification to the classical @xmath184 term in the constraint .",
    "the second modification is due to the curvature term @xmath178 and amounts to a modification of the classical @xmath53 term .",

    "the function @xmath205 for @xmath206 is approximately equal to one which implies that for @xmath207 , @xmath208 . for small volume @xmath205",

    "the modified @xmath210 function behaves quadratically for @xmath215 .",

    ", width=415 ]    thus we have determined the effective hamiltonian constraint given in equation ( [ heff ] ) which is valid in the regime where the connection component @xmath5 is small or more precisely when @xmath218 .",
    "the function @xmath201 in turn approximates the classical @xmath196 term for large volume when @xmath219 or equivalently when @xmath139 .",
    "let us now make contact with the standard formulation of isotropic cosmology written in terms of the scale factor @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the orientation of the triad is positive ( @xmath220 ) so we can drop the absolute value and sign terms in the formulas .",
    "according to equations ( [ p ] , [ pmu ] ) we have the relation between @xmath26 and the scale factor as @xmath221 . from the hamiltonian equations and the vanishing of the constraint we can derive the friedmann equation .",
    "we first have @xmath222 using @xmath223 we can use this equation to get the friedmann equation in terms of the connection as @xmath224 from this it is clear that the criteria @xmath218 corresponds to a criteria on the scale factor velocity being small @xmath225 . to get this equation in standard form we need to solve for the connection in terms of the matter hamiltonian .",
    "we can get this from the vanishing of the full hamiltonian constraint @xmath226 .",
    "this gives @xmath227 where we have only kept the terms to second order in @xmath228 .",
    "putting these two together we get the modified friedmann equation @xmath229 where the matter density is simply @xmath230 and as before @xmath231 .",
    "the modified friedmann equation remains valid provided @xmath225 .",
    "this in turn places a bound on the matter density @xmath232 below which the effective equations remain valid . from the modified friedmann equation it is clear that in the large volume regime ( where @xmath233 ) and small curvature ( where we neglect the @xmath234 term ) we recover the standard friedmann equation @xmath235 .",
    "let us reiterate the main results of the section .",
    "the modified effective hamiltonian constraint is given in equation ( [ heff ] ) and we rewrite it here @xmath236 where the function @xmath194 is given in equation ( [ sjeigs ] ) and approximates @xmath196 for large volume .",
    "the modified friedmann dynamics given in equation ( [ fried ] ) was calculated through the hamiltonian equations derived from the effective constraint .",
    "the effective constraint is valid when @xmath218 which in turn places a bound of validity determined by both the extrinsic curvature and on the matter density .",
    "in this paper we have sought to clear up certain issues in lqc , namely the complete consequences of quantizing the hamiltonian constraint using higher spin representations for the holonomies .",
    "in addition we have fixed the constants necessary to make contact on a consistent basis with the standard action of gr .",
    "we have found that the use of higher spin holonomies to regulate the gravitational part of the constraint operator leads to modifications of the @xmath237 term .",
    "the modifications are qualitatively similar to those of the inverse scale factor which lead to the @xmath238 function .",
    "this is not unexpected since we are quantizing the constraint operator to take into account factors involving the inverse triad ( the @xmath239 term ) .",
    "this modification , leading to the @xmath240 function , is another important consequence of a key mantra of lqc : to remain as close to the full theory of loop quantum gravity as possible .",
    "we could have exploited the symmetry of the isotropic model and quantized the @xmath196 term avoiding any inverse triad operators . because this is not possible in the full theory it is not done in lqc and the non - perturbative corrections are imported from the full theory .",
    "we have been guided by certain simplicity considerations .",
    "previous studies have used the @xmath241 gravitational part of the constraint ( and the resulting difference equation ) while freely choosing an arbitrary representation to define the inverse volume operator in the matter part of the constraint .",
    "while there is certain freedom to specify the representations differently and quantize the two parts in a different manner , for instance to define a @xmath242 for the gravitational part and a @xmath243 for the matter part , the simplest choice is to use the same representation .",
    "this ambiguity also exists in the parameter @xmath36 appearing in the matter and gravitational part .",
    "thus it is important to reexamine the phenomenological consequences in light of the modifications to the friedmann equation ( [ fried ] ) that arise for arbitrary values of @xmath0 .",
    "let us first concentrate on the modifications arising from @xmath240 .",
    "in the instance of a massless scalar field we have for the friedmann equation @xmath244 where we have used @xmath245 with @xmath246 being constant .",
    "to understand the behavior of the scalar field let us de - parameterize the equations of motion to remove the notion of time .",
    "this is in accord with notions of quantum gravity where coordinate time does not have any physical meaning .",
    "thus we are interested in how the scalar field evolves with the scale factor as opposed to coordinate time . from the hamiltonian equations we find that @xmath247 and we de - parameterize as @xmath248 to get @xmath249 which implies that the field is pushed to _ higher _ values in the region below @xmath138 since the @xmath250 appearing in the denominator is suppressed in that region .",
    "the addition of the @xmath194 corrections can therefore improve the viability of lqc to push the inflaton up its potential to set the initial conditions for slow - roll inflation .",
    "the consequences of the modifications to the friedmann equation quadratic in matter have not been explored .",
    "important though is that we have given a precise bound @xmath225 on the validity of the first order effective constraint .",
    "this is in contrast with the criteria for validity cited in other phenomenological investigations @xmath251 @xcite based on the notion that the hubble length should not be smaller than the fundamental length of discreteness @xmath252 .",
    "the criteria given here can be understood heuristically as follows .",
    "the discreteness of the difference equation plays a role precisely where the wheeler - dewitt approximation ( [ wdeqn ] ) breaks down , that is when the wave function changes significantly on the order of the fundamental step size @xmath151 .",
    "if we consider a wheeler - dewitt solution that is locally oscillatory @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the wavelength , then the discreteness becomes important when @xmath255 .",
    "given that in the wheeler - dewitt equation @xmath256 we find that the connection @xmath5 is related to @xmath254 as @xmath257 .",
    "using this we recover the criteria that the higher order corrections occur when @xmath258 .",
    "we can therefore understand that these corrections are a direct result of discreteness effects of the difference equation .",
    "the term quadratic in the matter density is negative definite in the friedmann equation and hence can act as an effective compactness even in the non - compact model considered in this paper . whether or not this would indeed imply a re - collapse depends on the inclusion of the full corrections to arbitrary order of @xmath259 .",
    "furthermore , classical descriptions in this regime are not expected to be valid since , as stated in the previous paragraph , this corresponds to the regime where the discreteness is dominant .",
    "a model where this occurs is desitter space which is discussed in detail in @xcite . in that model",
    "classically the extrinsic curvature grows with time and the wave functions become non semi - classical around a critical volume given by @xmath260 which is precisely when @xmath261 . above the critical volume",
    ", the wave function decays rapidly indicating a classically forbidden region and thus an effective compactness .",
    "thus this correction can have drastic consequences for the evolution of the universe .",
    "for ordinary matter such as dust or radiation , the matter density drops off sufficiently fast for these corrections not to be relevant at large volumes .",
    "yet the fact that observations suggest that the universe might be in an asymptotically desitter space call into question the validity of lqc for large volumes and a more detailed derivation of lqc from the full theory would likely solve this problem .",
    "we are in the process of examining numerically the full phenomenological consequences of the modified friedmann equation ( [ fried ] ) for more complicated forms of matter .",
    "the fact that the @xmath194 corrections help push the inflaton up its potential is a benefit to this scenario and would help enlarge the parameter space that leads to successful inflation .",
    "the key parameter involved in the quantum corrections is the regulating length @xmath36 .",
    "a deep understand of the origin of this parameter is essential before exact phenomenological predictions can be made . in",
    "the full theory one takes the limit as @xmath36 goes to zero and a well - defined operator remains which due to diffeomorphism invariance is independent of the regulator @xcite .",
    "in lqc the corrections for @xmath194 , @xmath134 as well as for large extrinsic curvature depend explicitly on the value of @xmath36 .",
    "if we were to take the limit of small @xmath36 , the phenomenological consequences of the quantum corrections would be pushed into the deep planckian regime .",
    "this might wash out any possible observational signals from lqc . yet , a smaller value of @xmath36 would also push to larger volumes the validity of lqc for the desitter example discussed above . in @xcite",
    "it is argued heuristically that @xmath36 is fixed to a value of @xmath45 in the hamiltonian constraint based on the smallest allowed area of the full theory .",
    "a more thorough understand of the parameter @xmath36 and its derivation from the full theory is required to settle this issue .    a key issue with which we have not dealt is the need to derive the effective equations of motion from solutions of the difference equation itself .",
    "several proposals have been put forth to date on this matter . in one @xcite ,",
    "kinematical semi - classical states are constructed and the effective constraint is calculated from the expectation value of the constraint operator .",
    "the validity of this is not entirely clear since the semi - classical states are not physical states in that they are not annihilated by the constraint operator .",
    "the corrections to the constraint do include a @xmath262 term as we showed in this paper ( in that paper the corrections are calculated for large volume for the @xmath241 constraint so would not include @xmath194 corrections ) .",
    "the exact factors for these corrections do not agree however .",
    "in addition corrections arise in that model due to the spread of the wave function , something of which we have not considered here in deriving the effective equations of motion .    in another technique @xcite ,",
    "wkb type solutions of the difference equation are calculated and from that an effective constraint is extracted . in this paper",
    "the modified constraint includes a @xmath263 c^2 $ ] term which to leading order is equivalent to the effective constraint of equation ( [ heff ] ) for @xmath1 .",
    "more detailed calculations in the wkb context @xcite show the higher order corrections in @xmath259 appearing in our effective constraint ( [ heff ] ) . in that paper the effective constraint for large volume is given by @xmath264 ( where we have adjusted the multiplicative factors to agree with ours ) which is precisely the effective constraint presented in this paper had we calculated all the higher order corrections for the @xmath1 constraint ( the @xmath265 term can be seen as the small @xmath259 expansion of @xmath266 ) . in addition the wkb effective constraint contains a potential term which contributes for small volume . again",
    "the interpretation of dynamics in the wkb setting is not entirely clear especially in the setting of the discrete difference equation of lqc .",
    "in addition the approximation used in @xcite relies on correlating wave function solutions of the difference equation on scales smaller than the fundamental step size @xmath267 .",
    "it can be shown in lqc that quantum interference only occurs for quantum states defined at values of @xmath26 differing by an integer times the fundamental step size @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically lqc does not correlate the quantum wave function at a given volume @xmath26 and a neighboring value @xmath268 where @xmath269 .",
    "a further method to determine semi - classical dynamics involves introducing a coordinate time parameter with which to consider evolution of gaussian wave packets @xcite . in that paper",
    "the wave packets are shown to follow the classical trajectory even to small volumes .",
    "the relevance of the solutions to physical solutions ( annihilated by the constraint operator and independent of any time parameterization ) has yet to be determined .",
    "each of the techniques to derive effective equations of motion are performed with models with zero degrees of freedom , and thus none consider physical semi - classical states . in quantum gravity where coordinate time is not a physical degree of freedom , one needs to include higher degrees of freedom and choose one of them to play the role of a clock .",
    "the model of a massless scalar field provides a testing ground for these ideas . in this model ,",
    "the volume is a monotonically increasing function ( classically ) and can play the role of a clock .",
    "a semi - classical state peaked around some value of the scalar field at a given volume can be evolved forward in `` time '' with the difference equation and the resulting trajectory compared with the effective equations of motion . this would have the benefit that the wave functions considered would be physical states annihilated by the constraint operator .",
    "early results for the spin @xmath13 difference equation indicate that the first order corrections for the effective equations match well with the results from the difference equations to volumes near the planck scale .",
    "while this issue would be trickier to study for the higher order spin @xmath0 difference equation , the agreement for the spin @xmath13 constraint is indicative of the validity of the effective equations .",
