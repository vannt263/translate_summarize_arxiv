    "in this paper a system of elasticity equations in the domains separated by a thin heterogeneous layer is considered .",
    "the layer is composed of periodically distributed vertical thin , compared to their length , beams , whose diameter and height tend to zero together with the period of the structure .",
    "the structure is clamped on the bottom .",
    "we consider the case of an isotropic linearized elasticity system .",
    "the elasticity problems involving thin layers of periodic fiber  networks appear in many technical applications , where special constraints on stiffness of technical textiles or composites are required , depending on a type of the application .",
    "for example , drainage and protective wear , working for outer ",
    "plane compression , should provide certain stiffness against external mechanical loading .",
    "thin layers were considered in number of papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , @xcite deals with a layer composed of the holes scaled with additional small parameter ; @xcite consider a case of a soft layer , whose stiffness is scaled by the thickness of the layer .",
    "thin beams and their junction with 3d structures were studied in @xcite : @xcite deals with the homogenization of a single thin body ; in @xcite a structure made of these bodies is considered .",
    "@xcite , @xcite study the limit behavior of structures composed of rods in junction with a plate .",
    "our problem contains 3 small parameters : the thickness @xmath3 of the layer ( and the height of the beams at the same time ) , the radius @xmath0 of the rods and the period of the layer @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , the choice of an appropriate scaling of the problem defines what limit will be reached .",
    "for example , in @xcite 3d periodic fiber  networks were considered and it is investigated , that if @xmath0 is of the order @xmath4 the bending moments in beams enter the homogenized macroscopic equation as micro ",
    "polar rotational degrees of freedom .    considering the structure made of thin beams",
    "the first difficulty arises when we obtain estimates on the displacements . to overcome this problem",
    ", we use the decomposition of thin beam s displacement into a displacement of a mean line and a rotation of its cross  section , introduced in @xcite . after deriving the estimates on the decomposed components , we get bounds for the minimizing sequence which depend on @xmath5 .",
    "3 critical cases were obtained with different ratios between small parameters .",
    "two of them are considered in the present paper and lead to the same kind of the limit problem .",
    "the third one corresponds no longer to the thin beams but to the small inclusions and therefore is not studied in the present paper .    in order to obtain the limit problem , periodic unfolding method,@xcite ,",
    "is applied to the components of the decomposition .",
    "two additional types of unfolding operators are introduced to deal with the mean displacements and rotations , depending only on component @xmath6 , and the warping depending on all @xmath7 . in the limit ,",
    "a 3d elasticity problem for two domains is obtained , where the domains are separated by the interface with an inhomogeneous robin  type condition .",
    "the coefficients in the robin condition are obtained from an auxiliary 1d bending problem for a beam .",
    "an important result is that the displacements are continuous in a direction normal to the interface and have a jump only in a tangential direction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , geometry and weak and strong formulations of the problem",
    "are introduced .",
    "section 3 presents decomposition of a single beam and the preliminary estimates .",
    "section 4 is devoted to derivation of a priori estimate in all subdomains of @xmath8 . in section 5 ,",
    "the periodic unfolding operators are introduced and their properties are defined . also the limit fields for the beams based on the estimates from section 4 are defined .",
    "section 6 deals with passing to the limit and obtaining the variational formulation for the limit problem . in section 7 , the results are summarized : the strong formulation for the limit problem is given and the final result on the convergences of the solutions is introduced .",
    "section 8 contains additional information .",
    "section 9 provides an auxiliary lemma , used in the proofs .",

    "to obtain a priori estimates on @xmath56 and @xmath57 we will need korn s inequalities for this type of domain .",
    "however , for a multi - structure like this , it is not convenient to estimate the constant in a korn s type inequality , because the order of each component of the displacement field may be very different . to overcome this difficulty , we will use a decomposition for the displacements of beams .",
