    "the lulu operators remove impulsive noise before a signal extraction from a sequence .",
    "they are computationally convenient and conceptually simpler compared to the the median smoothers usually considered to be the `` basic '' smoothers .",
    "the lulu operators have particular properties , e.g. they are fully trend preserving , @xcite , preserve the total variation , @xcite , etc . , which make them an essential tool for multiresolution analysis of sequences .",
    "furthermore , it was demonstrated during the last decade or so that these operators , being specific cases of morphological filters , @xcite , have a critical role in the analysis and comparison of nonlinear smoothers , @xcite .",
    "we extend the lulu theory from sequences to functions on a continuous domain , namely , a real interval @xmath7 .",
    "the existing lulu theory can be considered as a particular case in this new development , since the discrete lulu operators can be equivalently formulated for splines of order 1 or order 2 on the integer partition of real line , the one - to - one mapping being given by the b - spline basis .",
    "given a sequence @xmath8 and @xmath9 the operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 are defined as follows @xmath12 in analogy with the above discrete lulu operators , for a given @xmath1 the basic smoothers @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the lulu theory are defined for functions on @xmath7 through the concepts of the so called lower and upper @xmath6-envelopes of these functions . these definitions are given in section 2 , where it is also shown that the operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 preserve essential properties of their discrete counterparts .",
