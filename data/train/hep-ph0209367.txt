    "the higgs boson is the only particle in the standard model which has not yet been discovered . if the higgs mass @xmath11 is between @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath13 then the dominant production mechanism at the lhc is @xmath8 where the higgs boson couples to the gluons via a top - quark loop .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) processes given by @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 were originally studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite from which one can derive the transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) and rapidity ( @xmath4 ) distributions of the higgs boson .",
    "fortunately the calculations simplify if one takes the large top - quark mass limit @xmath7 . in this case",
    "the triangle graphs are obtained from an effective lagrangian describing the direct coupling of the higgs boson to the gluons , namely @xmath18 where @xmath19 here @xmath20 represents the higgs field and @xmath21 is an effective coupling constant which is related to the fermi coupling constant @xmath22 by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the running coupling constant which depends on the renormalization scale @xmath25 .",
    "the function @xmath26 tends to @xmath27 in the limit of large @xmath28 .",
    "further @xmath29 is the coefficient function which originates from the qcd corrections to the top - quark triangle graph describing the process @xmath30 in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "the lowest order contribution to @xmath31 is available in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a comparison was made for the differential distributions of the lo processes in @xcite where it was shown that the large top - quark mass approximation is valid as long as @xmath11 and @xmath3 are smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "the nlo matrix elements for @xmath33 etc . , using the effective lagrangian were computed in @xcite , @xcite albeit in four dimensions .",
    "the one - loop virtual corrections to the lo subprocesses were presented in @xcite , where the computation of the loop integrals was performed in @xmath34-dimensions but the matrix elements were still presented in four dimensions .",
    "in this paper we present results from @xcite where the nlo corrections to the double differential distributions @xmath35 for higgs boson production in hadron - hadron collisions were calculated .",
    "here we included all partonic subprocesses and used the g - g - h coupling in eq .",
    "a similar calculation has been performed in @xcite but our approach differs from it in various aspects .",
    "first our calculation is purely analytical and follows the calculation carried out for the drell - yan process describing vector boson production in hadron - hadron collisions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the approach in @xcite used helicity amplitudes and was based on the methods explained in @xcite .",
    "also it was mainly numerical and has the advantage that it can provide exclusive distributions . in our calculation the matrix elements as well as the loop integrals and phase space integrals are computed in @xmath34 dimensions .",
    "hence we could use results from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this analytical approach is that one gets more insight into the structure of the radiative corrections .",
    "this is particularly important for the large corrections , due to soft gluon radiation and collinear fermion pair production , which arise near the boundary of phase space , where the @xmath3 of the higgs boson gets large .",
    "resummation of this type of corrections has been carried out for the total cross section in @xcite .",
    "resummation of small @xmath3 contributions due to the sudakov effect has been done in @xcite . in view of the experimental problems to observe the higgs boson ,",
    "a recalculation of all the nlo corrections is necessary to be sure that the theoretical predictions are correct .",
    "finally we mention that another paper has appeared on the nlo corrections to the @xmath36 channel , using the helicity framework @xcite .    for our computations the number of light flavours is taken to be @xmath37 which holds for the running coupling , the partonic cross sections and the number of quark flavour densities .",
    "further we have chosen for our plots the parton densities obtained from the sets mrst98 @xcite cteq4 @xcite , grv98 @xcite and mrst99 @xcite . for simplicity",
    "the factorization scale @xmath38 is set equal to the renormalization scale @xmath25 . for our plots",
    "we take @xmath39 . here",
    "we want to emphasize that the magnitudes of the cross sections are extremely sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scale because the effective g - g - h coupling constant @xmath40 , which implies that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "however the slopes of the differential distributions are less sensitive to the scale choice if they are only plotted over a limited range . for the computation of the g - g - h effective coupling constant in eq .",
    "( 3 ) we chose the top - quark mass @xmath43 and the fermi constant @xmath44 .",
    "here we will only give results for higgs boson production in proton - proton collisions at the lhc center of mass energy @xmath45 .",
    "since the hadrons @xmath46 and @xmath47 are now identical the @xmath4 differential cross sections are symmetric ( for results see @xcite ) . in order to compare with the results in @xcite we present lo and nlo differential cross sections in @xmath3 , integrated over @xmath4 , for @xmath48 gev@xmath49 and @xmath50 in figs . 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "the mrst98 parton densities @xcite were used for these plots .",
    "we note that the nlo results from the @xmath51 and @xmath52 channels are negative at small @xmath3 so we have plotted their absolute values multiplied by 100 .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath53 subprocess dominates but the @xmath54-subprocess is also important , yielding one - third of the total at large @xmath3 .",
    "the lo(sum ) and nlo(sum ) are slightly lower when @xmath32 is taken very large in which case we agree with the results in @xcite .",
    "there are several uncertainties which affect the predictive power of the theoretical cross sections .",
    "the first one concerns scale dependence . in the case of the @xmath3-distribution one observes a small reduction in the scale dependence while going from lo to nlo .",
    "this reduction becomes more visible when we plot the quantity @xmath55 in the range @xmath56 at fixed values of @xmath57 30 , 70 and  100 gev / c , see fig.3 .",
    "the upper set of curves at small @xmath58 are for lo and the lower set are for nlo .",
    "notice that the nlo plots at 70 and 100 are extremely close to each other and it is hard to distinguish between them .",
    "further one sees that the slopes of the lo curves are larger that the slopes of the nlo curves .",
    "this is an indication that there is better stability in nlo , which was expected .",
    "however there is no sign of a flattening or an optimum in either of these curves which implies that one will have to calculate the differential cross sections in nnlo to find a better stability under scale variations .",
    "the second uncertainty concerns the rate of convergence of the perturbation series which is indicated by the @xmath10-factor defined by @xmath59 and finally there is the dependence of the cross section on the specific choice of parton densities , which can be expressed by the factors @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the above quantities were studied in our paper , where it was shown that there is still a large uncertainty in our predictions because the @xmath10-factor varies from approximately 1.4 to 1.7 depending on the parton density set .",
    "the latter uncertainty is mainly due to the small @xmath62 behaviour of the various gluon densities since both the partonic cross sections and the gluon densities increase very steeply at decreasing @xmath62 .",
    "finally we have defined the soft - plus - virtual ( s+v ) approximation and computed the ratio @xmath63 .",
    "this approximation is quite reasonable ( see fig .",
    "4 ) provided @xmath64 in spite of the fact that @xmath62 is still too small to belong to the large @xmath62-region .",
    "this means that this approximation can be used to resum the large corrections due to s+v gluons in order to obtain a better estimate of the all order corrected cross section .",
