    "this paper aims to complete and extend the study of antisymmetric and symmetric multivariate generalizations of common cosine functions of one variable from @xcite .",
    "first , the set of four symmetric and four antisymmetric discrete fourier - like transforms from @xcite is extended . then",
    "four families of chebyshev - like orthogonal polynomials are introduced and the entire collection of the 16 discrete cosine transforms ( dcts ) is used to derive the corresponding numerical integration formulas .",
    "the antisymmetric and symmetric cosine functions of @xmath2 variables are introduced in @xcite as determinants and permanents of matrices whose entries are cosine functions of one variable",
    ". the lowest - dimensional nontrivial case @xmath3 is detailed in @xcite .",
    "these real - valued functions have several remarkable properties such as continuous and discrete orthogonality which lead to continuous and discrete analogues of fourier transforms .",
    "the discrete orthogonality relations of these functions are a consequence of ubiquitous dcts and their cartesian product multidimensional generalizations .",
    "there are eight known different types of dcts based on various boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "only the first four transforms are generalized to the multidimensional symmetric cosine functions @xcite . therefore , the remaining four transforms of types v - viii need to be developed to obtain the full collections of antisymmetric and symmetric cosine transforms with all possible boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting 16 transforms are then available for similar applications as multidimensional dcts .",
    "besides a straightforward utilization of these transforms to interpolation methods , they may also serve as a starting point for chebyshev - like polynomial analysis .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials of one variable are well - known and extensively studied orthogonal polynomials connected to efficient methods of numerical integration and approximations .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials are of the four basic kinds @xcite , the first and third kinds related to the cosine functions , the second and fourth kinds related to the sine functions . since both families of antisymmetric and symmetric cosine functions are based on the one - dimensional cosine functions , they admit a multidimensional generalization of the one - dimensional chebyshev polynomials of the first and third kinds .",
    "the results are four families of orthogonal polynomials , which can be viewed as the symmetric and antisymmetric chebyshev - like polynomials of the first and third kinds .",
    "several generalizations of chebyshev polynomials to higher dimensions are known  in fact for the two - dimensional case the resulting polynomials become , up to a multiplication by constant , special cases of two - variable analogues of jacobi polynomials @xcite . in full generality ,",
    "multidimensional chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are constructed , for example , in @xcite , for broader theoretical background see also @xcite . as is the case of the chebyshev polynomials of one variable ,",
    "the multivariate chebyshev - like polynomials inherit properties from the generalized cosine functions .",
    "the link with these cosine functions provides tools to generalize efficient numerical integration formulas of the classical chebyshev polynomials .",
    "one of the most important application of the classical chebyshev polynomials is the calculation of numerical quadratures ",
    "formulas equating a weighted integral of a polynomial function not exceeding a specific degree with a linear combination of polynomial values at some points called nodes @xcite .",
    "the main point of quadrature formulas , which are in a multidimensional setting known as cubature formulas , is to replace integration by finite summing .",
    "the specific degree , to which cubature formulas hold exactly for polynomials , represents a degree of precision of a given formula .",
    "if a cubature formula holds only for polynomials of degree at most @xmath4 , then the least number of nodes is equal to the dimension of the space of multivariate polynomials of degree at most @xmath5 .",
    "any cubature formulas which satisfy the lowest bound of the number of nodes have the maximal degree of precision and are called the gaussian cubature formulas @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is known that such formulas exist only if the number of real distinct common zeros of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials of degree @xmath6 is also exactly the dimension of the space of the multivariate polynomials of degree at most @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it appears that among the 16 types of cubature formulas , resulting from 16 discrete transforms , 4 are gaussian .",
    "the remaining 12 , even though they are not optimal , extend the options for numerical calculation of multivariate integrals .    both antisymmetric and symmetric",
    "cosine functions can be restricted to their fundamental domain  a certain simplex in @xmath7 .",
    "for practical applications , it is essential that action of the permutation group @xmath8 on this simplex results in the entire space @xmath7 .",
    "thus , a domain of any function of @xmath2 real variables can be split into blocks  covered by sufficiently small copies of the fundamental domain .",
    "since the fundamental domain is a subset of the @xmath9dimensional cube , this method results in @xmath10 times more blocks than the standard splitting into @xmath9dimensional cubes .",
    "the multidimensional ( anti)symmetric dcts and the direct calculation of the corresponding interpolations are then performed in each of the blocks separately . moreover",
    ", the resulting dct coefficients can be further analyzed and serve as an input to multidimensional analogues of data hiding @xcite and image recognition @xcite methods . even though these methods can be applied to any sampled function , the more a given data set obeys the ( anti)symmetries and boundary conditions of the dcts at hand",
    ", the more suitable is the given method .",
    "the applicability of these methods to interpolation of potentials @xcite can be tested  for instance , any potential in physics , which depends on the radial distance from the origin only ( gravitational , coloumb , yukawa ) , is also symmetric as a function in @xmath11 .",
    "the 16 developed cubature formulas offer new options for numerical integration on the transformed fundamental domain via a certain substitution .",
    "the transformed domain is , however , of a nonstandard shape  two main approaches , discussed together with applications in discretizations of pdes and spectral approximations in @xcite , can be followed to rectify this impracticality .",
    "both these methods result in integration formulas on the simplex of the shape of the original fundamental domain .",
    "the first method straightens the transformed domain back to the original via a suitable straightening map ; this methods results in higher densities of the nodes around the corners and edges of the simplex .",
    "the second method inscribes the original fundamental domain into the transformed domain and considers only the intersection points as nodes .",
    "the main advantage of both methods is that the resulting discrete calculus on the simplex allows a block decomposition of any bounded domain and thus , similarly to the ( anti)symmetric cosine functions interpolation methods , can process practically any data set .    in section [ uvod ] ,",
    "notation and terminology as well as relevant facts from @xcite are reviewed .",
    "simplified forms of three special cases of the generalized cosine functions , which appear as denominators in the definition of the chebyshev - like multivariate polynomials , are deduced .",
    "the continuous orthogonality relations of the generalized cosine functions are presented . in section [ dmct ] , the one - dimensional dcts of types v  viii are reviewed and generalized to the antisymmetric and symmetric multivariate dcts .",
    "the interpolation formulas in terms of antisymmetric and symmetric cosine functions are developed . in section  [ seccheb ] , the four families of the multivariate chebyshev - like polynomials are introduced and three - dimensional examples presented .",
    "it is proved that each family of polynomials forms an orthogonal basis of the space of all polynomials with respect to the scalar product given by a weighted integral . in section [ seccub ] , the cubature formulas for each family of polynomials are derived .",
