    "the excitation of the solar oscillations results from the action of the reynolds tensor and of the turbulent fluctuations of entropy ; the latter comes from a heat exchange between the oscillations and the turbulent elements .",
    "the nature and the properties of the source term of excitation due to the reynolds tensor are well established @xcite , although the evaluation of this term remained crudely approximated . on the other hand , the source of excitation which takes its origin in the fluctuations of the entropy ,",
    "had given rise to major controversies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* gmk hereafter ) .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i hereafter ) , inconsistencies in the available theories were removed which led to a formulation which generalizes results from previous works , and is built so as to enable consistent investigations of various possible spatial and temporal spectra of stellar turbulent convection .",
    "it also shows that the actual entropy source term results from the advection of the turbulent fluctuations of entropy by the turbulent motions .",
    "these results are summarized in section  [ sec : theory of the stochastic excitation ] and section  [ sec : results in the solar case ] .",
    "the unavoidable free parameters introduced in the formulation are adjusted in order to obtain the best fit to the solar seismic observations . in a second step ,",
    "the comparison between the computed amplitudes and the observations as well as the use of theoretical arguments allow us to determine the ingredients in the theory which are still defective .",
    "section  4 then lists some unsolved problems which are brought up by our improvment of the theoretical approach in paper  i. final comments conclude about elements of the theory which still remain to be developed .",
    "the stochastic excitation mechanism results from a forcing of the stellar material by the turbulent motions and by a heat exchange due to the turbulent fluctuations of the entropy ; in other words , the acoustic power generated by the turbulence excites resonant modes of the stellar cavity ( oscillations ) .    in the presence of turbulence",
    "one shows that the radial oscillation velocity @xmath1 obeys the inhomogeneous wave equation ( see paper  i for details ) : @xmath2 + \\vec { \\cal d } ( \\vec v_{osc } )   & = &    { \\frac { \\partial   } { \\partial t } } \\left (   \\vec f_{t }   + \\vec \\nabla   h_t    \\right )   \\label{eqn : inhomogeneous_wave }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 the turbulent reynolds stress and the source term due to the turbulent entropy fluctuations respectively .",
    "the expression for the wave operator @xmath4 is given in paper  i. in eqs.([eqn : inhomogeneous_wave ] , [ eqn : f_t ] , [ eqn : h_t ] ) , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively denote density , entropy , sound speed , gravitational acceleration and velocity of the turbulent elements ; the subscript 0 refers to average mean quantities .",
    "the first term in the rhs of eq.([eqn : h_t ] ) is due to the lagrangian entropy fluctuation @xmath10 .",
    "the last two terms are due to the buoyancy force associated with the eulerian entropy fluctuations @xmath11 .",
    "these terms are found to contribute to the excitation as much as the reynolds source term .",
    "other source terms in the rhs of eq.([eqn : inhomogeneous_wave ] ) are found negligible in paper  i and are discarded here .",
    "the operator @xmath12 in eq.([eqn : inhomogeneous_wave ] ) is responsible for generating both a dynamical damping and a shift of the oscillation frequency due to the action of the turbulent elements .",
    "contribution of the operator @xmath12 to the damping is expected to be small compared to those of the other damping processes . and is assumed to be included in the global damping rate @xmath13 which takes into account all damping processes .    assuming no turbulence ( @xmath14 ) the velocity field is simply related to the pulsational radial displacement as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the undriven pulsational radial displacement in the absence of turbulence .",
    "eigensolutions of eq.([eqn : inhomogeneous_wave ] ) complemented with boundary conditions , can be written , in the absence of turbulence , in terms of the displacement @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the oscillation frequency and @xmath19 is the adiabatic ( real ) displacement eigenvector which satisfies @xmath20 .    when turbulence is present , the pulsational displacement and velocity",
    "are written in terms of the above adiabatic solution @xmath21 and an instantaneous amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "accordingly @xmath23 where cc means complex conjugate .",
    "the mode energy , averaged over a time scale smaller than the mode lifetime @xmath24 and larger than the eddies time scale , is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mode inertia and @xmath27 is the mean square amplitude .",
    "finally a general expression for the power , @xmath28 , going into each mode is established in paper  i : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the turbulent reynolds stress and the entropy contributions respectively given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average position where the power is evaluated whereas @xmath34 and @xmath35 are related to the local turbulence .",
    "subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the spatial and temporal positions @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] respectively .",
    "it is shown that the terms @xmath38 and @xmath39 in eq.([eqn : c2r ] ) do not change over the length scale of the eddies .",
    "consequently , in eq.([eqn : c2r ] ) , integrations over @xmath40 and @xmath41 only involve the phase term @xmath42 and the fourth - order velocity correlations @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    the quasi - normal approximation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap vii-2 , qna hereafter ) is adopted so that the fourth - order velocity correlations can be written as a product of second - order velocity correlations @xmath46 .",
    "the properties of @xmath47 are well known in the fourier domain @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the wavenumber and the frequency associated with a turbulent element .",
    "the second - order velocity correlations can be expressed formally in term of @xmath51 the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum . following @xcite , the velocity energy spectrum @xmath52",
    "is written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a frequency - dependent factor which can be related to the time correlation of the eddies in the frequency space .",
    "finally a general expression for @xmath30 involving @xmath55 and @xmath54 is given in paper  i : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a constant anisotropic factor .",
    "we assume in paper  i that @xmath10 and @xmath11 in eq.([eqn : h_t ] ) act as passive scalars .",
    "let @xmath58 be the spectrum of the scalar correlation product @xmath59 .",
    "it is also assumed that the frequency - dependent component of @xmath59 is the same than those of the velocity field correlation product @xmath47 and that @xmath58 can be decomposed as @xmath60 in eq.([eqn : ek_chik ] ) . as a consequence of the above assumptions",
    ", it is then demonstrated that the correlation product of the lagrangian entropy fluctuations @xmath61 vanishes after integration over @xmath62 in eq.([eqn : c2s ] ) .",
    "this result may be explained as follows : turbulence and oscillation are coupled through the phase term @xmath63 and through the turbulent time spectrum @xmath54 .",
    "therefore this coupling occurs at frequencies close to the oscillation frequency @xmath18 .",
    "it then follows that the coupling between turbulence and oscillation involves eddies of wavenumber @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the wavenumber of the mode and @xmath66 that of an eddy . on the other hand",
    "the spatial component of @xmath67 in the fourier space favors eddies with the largest size ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "these two opposite effects clearly are incompatible and lead to a vanishing contribution for the lagrangian entropy fluctuation .",
    "this does not happen for the contribution of the reynolds source term which involves the fourth - order velocity correlation product . according to the qna",
    "this term can be decomposed in term of a product of two second - order velocity correlations .",
    "coupling with the oscillation then becomes non - linear and leads to an effective non zero contribution .",
    "thus _ only non - linear terms , with respect to the fluctuations , can contribute to mode excitation while linear terms do not_. this may be considered as a general result .    with an analogous procedure than for the reynolds stress contribution , we show that the entropy contribution can be expressed as : @xmath69 with @xmath70 a function which expression is given in paper  i and @xmath71 a constant anisotropic factor similar to @xmath57 .",
    "on one hand , the turbulence theory tells us that @xmath55 follows the kolmogorov spectrum as @xmath72 with the slope @xmath73 . on the other hand , observations of the solar granulation allow one to determine the turbulent kinetic spectrum @xmath55 of the sun .",
    "several kinetic turbulent spectra have been suggested by different observations of the solar granulation : the  raised kolmogorov spectrum  ( rks hereafter ) , the `` nesis kolmogorov spectrum '' ( nks hereafter ) and the `` broad kolmogorov spectrum '' ( bks hereafter ) .",
    "these spectra ( figure [ fig : adjust ] ) obey the kolmogorov law for @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the wavenumber at which the turbulent cascade begins .",
    "they differ in the injection region ( @xmath76 ) where they are characterized by different values for the slope @xmath77 .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath75 is unknown but can be related to the mixing length @xmath78 as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a free parameter introduced for the arbitrariness of such definition ( paper  i ) .",
    "moreover the definition of the eddy correlation time , which enters the description of the turbulent excitation , is somewhat arbitrary and is therefore gauged by introducing an additional free parameter @xmath81 .",
    "the power injected into the solar oscillations is related to the rms value @xmath82 of the surface velocity as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the radius at which oscillations are measured .",
    "observations of the solar oscillations provide @xmath82 and @xmath13 such that @xmath85 can be evaluated from pbservations . on the theoretical side , the power @xmath85 is computed according to eqs([eqn : power ] , [ eqn : a2_0 ] , [ eqn : c2r_3 ] , [ eqn : c2s_7 ] ) for a calibrated solar model .",
    "the physical ingredients of the model are detailed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  ii hereafter ) . as was done in paper  ii",
    ", the free parameters @xmath86 are adjusted in order to obtain the best fit to the solar seismic observations by @xcite theoretical arguments support the fact that the current theory of stochastic excitation is less justified for the low frequency modes than for the high frequency ones ( see below section  [ static and dynamic properties of the turbulent medium ] ) . therefore in the following @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    "are adjusted in order to reproduce , as best as possible , the frequency dependency of @xmath87 at high frequencies ( @xmath88  mhz ) .",
    "results of the fitting are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adjust ] . as a consequence of the adjustement ,",
    "all the kinetic turbulent spectra fit well the solar observations at high frequency ( @xmath88  mhz ) while the main differences are observed at low frequency .",
    "the overall best agreement is obtained with the nks .",
    "moreover we find that the entropy source term significantly contributes to the excitation process of solar - like oscillations by turbulent convection , in agreement with the results of gmk and simulations by @xcite .",
    "as stressed by @xcite , differences at low wavenumber between the kinetic spectra obtained from different observations of the solar granulation are a consequence of uncontrolled data - averaging procedures .",
    "mean average ( static ) properties of the kinetic spectrum at low wavenumber ( mesogranulation ) are thus not yet well represented by the observations of the solar surface . in the same way , @xcite demonstrated with a numerical simulation that observations of the solar granulation can not provide a meaningful determination of the turbulent properties .",
    "therefore , the mean average ( static ) properties of the different turbulent spectra - suggested by the current observations of the solar granulation - are not yet well established .    on the theoretical side , the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : c2r_3 ] ) and eq.([eqn : c2s_7 ] ) uses the decomposition of eq.([eqn : ek_chik ] ) .",
    "@xmath55 depicts the static properties of the turbulent medium whereas @xmath52 characterizes the dynamic properties . in paper",
    "ii different forms for @xmath54 -   which were suggested by @xcite  - were tested . from the comparison with the solar seismic data we can not clearly discriminate between the different forms",
    "and we finally adopted the gaussian form ( paper  ii )",
    ".    however it is suggested in @xcite that the decomposition of eq.([eqn : ek_chik ] ) is not valid at small wavenumber ( in the injection region , i.e. for @xmath89 ) .",
    "indeed the high frequency modes involve small size turbulent elements ( @xmath90 ) . at this scale ( the inertial range ) the lifetime @xmath91 of the turbulent elements are shorter than the timescale @xmath92 at which energy is injected into the turbulent cascade",
    ". therefore at small scales injection of energy into the cascade appears stationary and the dynamic properties of @xmath93 are only fixed by the lifetime @xmath91 of the eddies .",
    "the line - width of the function @xmath54 provides a statistical measure of @xmath91 . as a consequence , the decomposition of eq.([eqn : ek_chik ] )",
    "should be valid for @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast at large scales , ( @xmath89 ) , the lifetime of the turbulent elements is of the same order than @xmath92 .",
    "therefore the energy transfer between large and small elements is no longer stationary and consequently the decompostion of eq.([eqn : ek_chik ] ) is probably no longer valid .",
    "this statement explains the large changes observed at low frequency between the different spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : adjust ] ) . indeed",
    "the low frequency modes involve the largest eddies and the changes at low frequency are therefore due to the differences in the static properties of the turbulent spectra in the injection region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : adjust ] ) .",
    "the best agreement is obtained with the nks which however appears as the less realistic spectrum .",
    "in contrast the more plausible spectra ( rks and bks ) significantly overestimate the amplitudes at low frequency .",
    "these results prove that the dynamic properties of @xmath93 is not correctly modeled through the decomposition of eq.([eqn : ek_chik ] ) in the range @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , the decomposition of eq.([eqn : ek_chik ] ) is also used for the turbulent spectrum @xmath58 of the entropy fluctuations .",
    "therefore the above conclusions also apply to @xmath58 .",
    "the present theory of stochastic excitation only concerns the radial @xmath77-modes .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the stratification does not affect the transfer of acoutic power into the radial modes .",
    "the high @xmath95 degree modes propagate in both radial and horizontal directions .",
    "the acoustic power injected into high @xmath95 degree modes is therefore more sensitive to the stratification .",
    "the current theory is mainly based on the approximation that the stratification and the sources of excitation are well decoupled .",
    "@xcite showed that the acoustic emission arising from the stratification is negligible compared to the reynolds stress emission .",
    "however some high @xmath95 degree modes propagate mainly in the horizontal direction in the excitation region . for such modes",
    "it is important to evaluate the contribution of the stratification to the acoutic power emission .",
    "the present paper summarizes the theory of solar oscillation excitation at it is exposed in @xcite . in particular assumptions and approximations which were used are recalled here with some details .",
    "open issues in this field are also discussed such as the way the turbulence is modeled and the case of non - radial modes :    the way the turbulence is currently modeled at large scale length introduces large uncertainties in the computation of the power injected into the low frequency modes ( @xmath96  mhz in the solar case ) .",
    "a more robust modeling of the large scales is thus needed in order to extend to low frequencies the validity of the current theory .",
    "this can be achieved with the use of 3d simulations of the solar convection zone ( work in progress ) .",
    "current theories only concern the excitation of radial modes . for non - radial modes effect of the stratification upon the excitation may be important whereas it is negligible for radial ones .",
    "therefore effects of the stratification to the power emission in the high @xmath95 degree modes , as well as the @xmath95 dependency of the current theory of stochastic excitation , should be addressed ( work in progress ) ."
