    "systems locating in between one dimension and two dimensions , ladders , have attracted great attention both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite this line of research has been pursued both with the hope of finding some clues to the understanding of the high - temperature superconductivity , and because of the experimental discoveries of new ladder compounds , such as a cuprate spin ladder@xcite srcu@xmath3o@xmath4 and a superconducting ladder@xcite sr@xmath5ca@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 .",
    "another spin ladder system of current interest is the organic material cu@xmath3(c@xmath9h@xmath10n@xmath3)@xmath3cl@xmath11 whose spin - gap behavior was observed by the measurements of the spin susceptibility , the magnetization curve , and the nmr relaxation rate.@xcite the nonzero magnetization is observed once the external magnetic field @xmath12 exceeds the lower critical field @xmath1 which is equal to the spin gap ( in units where the product of the bohr magneton and the @xmath13-factor is set to be unity ) .",
    "this is a quantum phase transition driven by the external magnetic field from the gapped spin liquid to the gapless tomonaga - luttinger liquid state .",
    "these experiments motivated further theoretical works on the various properties of the gapless regime : the magnetization process,@xcite the spin - spin correlation functions,@xcite and the spin - peierls instability.@xcite    in this paper we extend the theory of shelton _",
    "et al._@xcite to the two - leg heisenberg ladder in the gapless regime ( @xmath14 ) and calculate the dynamical spin - spin correlation functions and structure factors in the ground state.@xcite we obtain the dynamical structure factors containing massive spin excitations as well as massless excitations .",
    "the latter contribution is characteristic of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid and is commonly found in the @xmath15 heisenberg chain.@xcite this component may be interpreted as coming from the bose - condensate of @xmath16 magnons.@xcite on the other hand , the massive excitations we are interested in have @xmath17 magnons in their origin . below @xmath1",
    "the massive magnons give rise to @xmath18-function peaks in the dynamical structure factor . in the gapless regime ( @xmath14 )",
    "the @xmath18-function peaks of the massive excitations turn into power - law singularities , because the massless excitations introduce algebraically decaying prefactors to the exponentially decaying correlation functions .",
    "an interesting feature of the antiferromagnetically coupled heisenberg ladder is that these massless and massive modes appear in different sectors of the structure factors , characterized by the momentum @xmath19 in the direction of the rungs ( @xmath19 can take only 0 and @xmath2 ) and by the momentum @xmath20 in the direction of the chains .    our study of the massive excitations in the gapless regime is also motivated to better understand the @xmath2-resonance mode@xcite in the so(5 ) symmetric ladder model introduced recently by scalapino _",
    "et al_.@xcite in this model there is a quantum phase transition driven by the chemical potential from the spin - gap mott insulator to the @xmath21-wave - like superconducting phase .",
    "it was shown in the strong - coupling limit that the spin - gap magnon mode of the mott insulator evolves continuously into the @xmath2-resonance mode of the superconducting phase.@xcite a complementary weak - coupling approach@xcite was taken to study a general two - leg ladder model of weakly interacting electrons .",
    "in particular , lin _ et al._@xcite showed that the model is renormalized to a fixed point where a global so(8 ) symmetry is realized that contains the so(5 ) .",
    "they also obtained the ground - state phase diagram and low - energy excitation spectra at half filling which are qualitatively in agreement with the strong - coupling picture of the so(5 ) symmetric ladder model .",
    "yet the energy and the spectral weight of the @xmath2-resonance mode in the dynamical spin structure factor are not completely understood even for the ideally constructed so(5 ) symmetric ladder .",
    "an extensive numerical exact - diagonalization study is performed to clarify this and related issues,@xcite but clearly it is desirable to develop an analytic theory to discuss the power - law singularity which is expected to appear in the structure factor.@xcite the field - driven quantum phase transition in the heisenberg ladder we study in this paper is analogous to the quantum phase transition in the so(5 ) symmetric ladder .",
    "a @xmath16 boson in the heisenberg ladder corresponds to a hole pair in the latter model , and a @xmath17 boson to a magnon or the @xmath2-resonance mode .",
    "therefore our heisenberg spin ladder may be viewed as a toy model for the so(5 ) symmetric ladder . using the analogy",
    ", we can deduce the correlation functions for the @xmath21-wave superconductivity , the charge density wave , and the spin correlations in the so(5 ) ladder from the spin - spin correlators of the heisenberg ladder .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and analyze it in the limit of strong interchain coupling , where it is easier to get intuitive pictures of the physics . detailed calculation of the dynamical spin - spin correlation functions and the structure factors are presented in sec .",
    "here we take the opposite limit of the weak interchain coupling , and employ the bosonization method . in sec .",
    "iv we briefly discuss implications to the @xmath2-resonance in the so(5 ) symmetric ladder model and summarize the results .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two - leg heisenberg ladder we study in this paper is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is spin-@xmath0 operator , and the intrachain coupling @xmath24 is positive ( antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "the interchain coupling @xmath25 is also assumed to be positive , unless otherwise noted .    in this section",
    "we briefly discuss static correlations above the lower critical field @xmath1 in the strong - coupling limit , @xmath26 . when @xmath27 , the ladder is decomposed into independent rungs , each rung consisting of two spins @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "there are four eigenstates in each rung , the singlet @xmath30 , and the triplet states @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "their energies are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "it is then natural to introduce boson operators @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , which create the singlet state and the triplet states at the @xmath42th rung.@xcite they obey the constraint , @xmath43 . with these hard - core bosons",
    "we represent the spin operators    @xmath44    the suffixes @xmath45 and @xmath2 refer to the momentum @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath46 and @xmath47 do not contain the @xmath48 boson .    in the presence of a high magnetic field @xmath49",
    ", we may ignore the @xmath48 and @xmath50 bosons as they have higher energies than the @xmath51 boson .",
    "in lowest order in @xmath24 the effective hamiltonian thus becomes @xmath52 with the simplified constraint @xmath53 . as pointed out in ref .",

    "the parameter @xmath71 is given by@xcite @xmath72 in general @xmath73 for @xmath61 , and @xmath74 when @xmath75.@xcite thus , the leading term in @xmath76 , besides the constant @xmath77 , is @xmath78 , which reflects the fact that the hard - core bosons @xmath51 have a tendency to form a density wave with a period equal to @xmath79 . on the other hand , the correlation functions @xmath80 and",

    "these correlation functions are discussed in more detail in the next section .    before closing this section",

    "an important difference is that @xmath90 in the @xmath89 chain.@xcite we will come back to this point in the next section .",
    "second , from the knowledge of the exact propagator of hard - core bosons,@xcite we may expect that the correlation function @xmath91 should have terms proportional to @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "third , as noted in introduction and will be discussed in sec .",
    "iv , the @xmath51 boson and @xmath48 boson correspond to a pair of holes sitting on a rung and to a magnon in the so(5 ) symmetric ladder , respectively .",
    "thus , we may compare the hole - pair correlation and the spin correlation functions with @xmath94 and @xmath80 of our model .",
    "in this section we calculate the dynamical spin - spin correlation functions in the weak - coupling limit , @xmath95 .",
    "we use the abelian bosonization method which has been successfully applied to the heisenberg ladder.@xcite in this approach we first bosonize two independent spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chains and then treat the interchain coupling @xmath25 perturbatively .",
    "it is a relevant perturbation and is renormalized to a strong - coupling regime , generating a mass gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "this behavior does not depend on the sign of @xmath25 , and therefore the model describes both the antiferromagnetic heisenberg ladder for @xmath96 and the @xmath89 heisenberg chain for @xmath97.@xcite the spin gap in the latter case is nothing but the haldane gap.@xcite since the gapless phase in a magnetic field is a single phase for @xmath98 , we expect the correlation functions in the weak - coupling limit to have the same structure as in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "we follow the formulation of shelton _",

    "this is equivalent to the two - dimensional ising model above or below the critical temperature .",
    "this observation allowed them to obtain the dynamical spin - spin correlation functions@xcite from the known results of the ising model.@xcite physically the @xmath125 fermion describes the @xmath17 magnon excitation , whereas the @xmath126 corresponds to a singlet excitation with much higher energy .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath111 and @xmath112 fields represent the @xmath127 magnon excitations . as the @xmath16 bosons condense above @xmath1",
    ", these bosonic fields have massless excitations",
    ". we will first integrate out the massive majorana fermions and concentrate on the massless bosonic fields .",
    "to proceed , here we introduce an approximation for dealing with @xmath128 .",
    "this interaction hamiltonian has three components .",
    "the first component involving only @xmath113 and @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , has two major effects on the dynamics of @xmath120 .",
    "one effect is to renormalize the bare mass @xmath123 to @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is a high - energy cutoff , as noted by shelton _",
    "et al._@xcite this can be absorbed by redefining the mass .",
    "the other effect is a strong two - particle collision described by a @xmath133 matrix having a superuniversal form , as recently discussed by damle and sachdev.@xcite since we are only concerned with processes in which at most one @xmath17 magnon is created , this strong scattering effect may be irrelevant for our discussion of the dynamical correlations at zero temperature .",
    "the second component is a coupling term , @xmath134 . when integrating out the @xmath114 field perturbatively , we find that the leading term @xmath135 gives the renormalization of the mass of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 fields , @xmath136 , as expected from the so(3 ) symmetry , where the average is taken in the ground state of @xmath120 .",
    "this is again taken care of by redefining the mass .",
    "the higher - order terms will generate , through gradient expansions , both irrelevant terms like @xmath137 with @xmath138 , which we can safely ignore , and a marginal operator @xmath139 , which should be kept .",
    "the third component is the term @xmath140 already present in @xmath128 and will be kept in the following calculation .",
    "hence we reduce @xmath128 to the form @xmath141 where the coupling constant @xmath142 may be modified from its bare value because of the emergence of the operator @xmath139 in the higher - order terms discussed above .",
    "we believe , however , that the sign of the coupling constant is not changed by the renormalization.@xcite having made this approximation , we now integrate out the @xmath113 and @xmath114 fields to get the spin - spin correlation functions . within our approximation",
    "the fields @xmath113 and @xmath114 are independent of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and therefore the correlation functions of @xmath113 and @xmath114 are independent of @xmath12 .",
