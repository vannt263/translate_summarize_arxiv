    "the fate of massive stars with mass of more than 8 times the solar mass is spectacular in the end when they have used up their nuclear energy by creating the fe core , which has the largest binding energy per particle .",
    "when the fe core mass exceeds the chandrasekhar mass supported by the degenerate electron pressure against the gravitational force , the fe core starts to collapse until the central density becomes around that of the normal matter density .",
    "there the strong repulsive force and the pauli effect among nucleons work against the gravitational collapse and swing back the matter motion outwards .",
    "if this outward motion is strong enough to blow off the outer layers , the stellar explosion is observed as supernova .",
    "this is called the prompt explosion .",
    "the strength of the outward shock motion depends crucially on the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter .",
    "the general belief in the recent years is , however , that the outward shock propagation alone is not strong enough to succeed supernova explosion .",
    "most of the gravitational collapse energy is carried away by neutrinos .",
    "if some small fraction of the neutrino energy is dropped in the stellar matter just behind the slowing down shock region with possible help of the hydrodynamic instability , the outward shock motion can survive to blow off the outer materials .",
    "this is called the delayed explosion . whichever the mechanism of the supernova explosion is , we need detailed knowledges on the eos of nuclear matter and also the neutrino reaction rates in nuclear matter in the wide ranges of density and temperature .",
    "we have started a project to provide these informations , the eos and the neutrino reaction rates , by studying carefully the existing knowledge on finite nuclei including the unstable nuclei and the weak processes . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the results on the eos .",
    "the knowledge on nuclear matter necessary for supernova simulations is much more than that obtained from the study of finite nuclei .",
    "the density may go up to 5 to 10 times the normal matter density in the stellar phenomena .",
    "the temperature may climb up to 30 to 50 mev .",
    "the proton fraction may go down to zero , the pure neutron matter .",
    "hence , we have to make a large extrapolation to all directions from our knowledge on nuclear physics which are available from laboratory experiments .",
    "hence , we have to construct a theoretical model , which has a strong basis from the microscopic theory and at the same time is easy to handle for many observables .",
    "this theoretical model has to be checked with many experimental facts on finite nuclei .    in recent years",
    ", there was a very important achievement on the theoretical understanding on nuclear physics .",
    "the use of the relativistic many body theory enabled us to remove the long standing problem on the nuclear saturation property , which is not reproduced in the non - relativistic approach @xcite .",
    "the relativistic theory can reproduce many observables on the nuclear structure including the unstable nuclei and also the nuclear reactions , in particular the spin observables @xcite .",
    "the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf ) theory reproduced the saturation property of the nuclear matter very close to the experimental value and removed the disease of the non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock theory , which provided the saturation points lying on the coester line .",
    "the relativistic framework contains very strong density dependent repulsive component due to z - graph three body process in the language of non - relativistic framework . the strong spin - orbit force and",
    "the spin dynamics are the natural consequences of the relativistic equation of motion .    hence , we chose the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory , which is relatively easy to use and at the same time carries the essential features of the microscopic theory as the rbhf theory , as a phenomenological model to describe nuclei and nuclear matter at various circumstances @xcite .",
    "first , the rmf lagrangian was constructed to provide the results of the rbhf , for which we include the non - linear @xmath12 meson coupling term in addition to the generally used non - linear @xmath13 meson coupling terms .",
    "we fixed the model parameters as the coupling constants and the masses so as to reproduce many key experimental data on the ground state masses and the radii of nuclei including unstable ones @xcite .",
    "the parameter set was named tm1 and then applied to many observables as deformed nuclei , triaxial deformations , nuclear excitations @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the existing data is extremely satisfactory .",
    "hence , the rmf theory with the tm1 parameter set could go through the critical check from nuclear physics .",
    "the rbhf results for the symmetric nuclear matter were also compared very nicely up to high density .",
    "this was the place we decided to go on to construct the eos table for the astrophysical use .",
    "we want to state here our philosophy .",
    "the purpose of making this table with only the nuclear degree of freedom is to work out the best eos with the known experimental and the theoretical knowledge on nuclear physics .",
    "this eos should be considered as the basis eos . at high density and temperature ,",
    "however , there may be the need of the mixture of hyperons , various mesons and even quarks .",
    "as our knowledges on these degrees of freedom become more solid , we should include them for the eos table , in particular at high density .",
    "we work out the eos of nuclear matter in the wide parameter ranges in density , temperature and proton fraction .",
    "the density range is @xmath14 , the temperature range is @xmath15 and the proton fraction is @xmath16 . in very high density and high temperature region ,",
    "the nuclear matter is homogeneous and hence the calculation is not difficult .",
    "however , when the density is below @xmath17 the matter becomes inhomogeneous . in order to treat the inhomogeneous matter",
    ", we take the thomas - fermi approximation , where the inhomogeneous matter is composed of a lattice of spherical nuclei with protons , neutrons and alpha - particles @xcite .",
    "we then minimize the free energy of the nuclear system with respect to the proton , neutron and alpha - particle densities in the nuclear interior and the exterior regions .",
    "this procedure has to be performed for each temperature , density and the proton fraction , which is extremely cumbersome . at the same time",
    ", we have to repeat the minimization procedures with good accuracy in order to get the smooth physical quantities as the free energy , pressure and the entropy for the use of supernova simulations .",
