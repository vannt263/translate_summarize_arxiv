    "the equations of fluid mechanics appear to provide an adequate description for the flow of liquids for an extremely wide range of boundary conditions and external forcing .",

    "regular liquids can not support any amount of stress without flowing .",

    "we focus attention on the steady - state plastic flow which is obtained under the action of a constant external strain rate .",
    "we will argue below that the characterization of such a state is considerably simpler than the full description of transient states , the latter call for a larger number of macroscopic variables whose nature is not obvious and the constitutive relations between them are not known . for the steady plastic flow state we can make progress and determine what are the state variables that determine the state uniquely .    to simplify things further",
    "we limit our attention at present to materials whose inter - particle potential can be approximated , for the range of inter - particle distances of relevance , by an inverse power law potential .",
    "this same class of materials and the interesting scaling properties that they exhibit attracted considerable interest in the context of the dynamics of super - cooled liquids , first experimentally @xcite and then theoretically @xcite . in the context of the mechanical properties of amorphous solids we believe that the first example of using the special scaling properties of these materials appeared in @xcite where focus was put on the athermal limit and quasi - static strain . in this paper",

    "the discussion culminates with finding which are the minimal number of re - scaled state variables that determine uniquely the steady plastic flow in such materials .",
    "any general theory that attempts to provide a complete description of elasto - plasticity in amorphous solids should reduce , in the steady flow state of materials of the present class , to a theory that contains these and only these variables .",

    "also , we will refer to the dimensionless density as just the density , for the sake of brevity .",
    "initial conditions for all the simulations , for both methods described in the next subsection , were obtained by instantaneous quenching of random , high temperature configurations ; this explains the apparent noise and absence of stress peaks in the transients .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that due to finite system sizes , the initial value of the stress of the quenched configurations in some experiments is non - zero ; this is however irrelevant for steady state statistics .",
    "the work presented here is based on two types of simulational methods .",
    "the first type corresponds to the athermal quasi - static ( aqs ) limit @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the strain rate .",
    "aqs methods have been extensively used recently @xcite as a tool for investigating plasticity in amorphous systems .",
    "the order in which the limits @xmath34 are taken is important , since one expects that at any finite temperature the stress in the system can thermally relax given long enough time @xcite ( or small enough strain rates ) , hence the limit @xmath31 should be taken prior to the @xmath32 limit .",

    "we define the flow stress @xmath1 to be the steady - state value of the stress under constant external strain rate . in general ,",
    "the flow stress is a function of a set of state variables , which specify the conditions in which the experiments are carried out . for the systems and experiments discussed in this work , the flow stress depends on the density @xmath54 , the temperature @xmath55 , and the strain rate @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , one can expect also a dependence on the heat extraction rate @xmath56 . we choose to exclude the latter from the present discussion , and we do so by choosing the rate of heat extraction to be much larger than the rate of heat production .",
    "so , we propose at this point that @xmath57 .",
    "the yield stress @xmath58 is defined as the steady state value of the stress under the limits @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see discussion regarding these limits in subsect .",
    "[ analytic ] ) , i.e. @xmath59      in the athermal , quasi - static limit the only parameter left is the density ; consideration of the temperature and strain rate effects will be taken up in the next subsection .",
    "denote the distribution of inter - particle distances as @xmath60 ; then the mean inter - particle distance is @xmath61 .",
    "note that this probability distribution only accounts for distances which are relevant in terms of the interaction , namely for @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath60 is sufficiently sharply peaked around @xmath46 , we can write @xmath63 from here we predict that for our systems with short - range forces the scaling of the yield stress should be @xmath64 in the athermal , quasi - static limit the shear modulus must obey the same scaling @xmath65    these scaling laws lead to the expectation that re - plotting stress - strain curves in terms of re - scaled variable @xmath66 should result in complete data collapse . indeed ,",
    "our simulations vindicate this expectation . in fig .",
    "[ rawsig ] we present the raw stress - strain curves in the athermal , quasi - static limit using seven different values of the density . for each density",

    "[ scalesig ] demonstrates the superb data collapse for the scaled variable .",
    "the insets are a direct test of the scaling laws ( [ ysscaling ] ) and ( [ smscaling ] ) .",
    "once we perform measurements at finite temperatures and external strain rates the scaling considerations must incorporate temporal and energy scales .",
    "the typical free energy density in the steady - state plastic flow should scale like @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the typical strain interval between plastic events , @xmath70 .",
    "accordingly , the intensive energetic contribution to barriers @xmath71 ( that govern thermal activation ) scales with the density according to @xmath72 note that this is the  density scaling \" proposed in @xcite in the context of the dynamics of super - cooled liquids . for the present purposes we need to explore further scaling relations",

    "putting together all these we finally propose the expected scaling - function form for the flow stress @xmath81 : @xmath82 this is the central theoretical result of this section .",
    "we stress that we chose to favor the flow stress and wrote it in terms of the scaling function of the other two dimensionless variables .",

    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "( [ all_x ] ) .",
    "we see the excellent data collapse and also the quality of the scaling laws for the flow stress ; the slopes of the lines in the right panels are those predicted theoretically in eq .",
    "( [ moo1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath91 .",
    "we now test the quality of the prediction of the existence of the scaling function @xmath92 . to this aim",
    "we fixed a value of @xmath93 and the same @xmath89 , and simulated the entire range of @xmath94 values for which @xmath92 exists .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ sofx ] , in addition to the data obtained for all the other densities and @xmath94 values shown in fig .",
    "[ all_x ] .",
    "the excellent data collapse is quite apparent .",
    "it is noteworthy that at low temperatures the function reaches smoothly , albeit with a very high gradient , precisely the athermal , quasi - static limit that was studied in the previous subsection .",
    "the high gradient as @xmath95 in a similar , experimentally obtained function , was interpreted in @xcite as resulting from quantum - mechanical effects . obviously in our purely classical simulations",
    "there are no quantum effects and it remains very interesting to unfathom the origin of the very fast change in the flow stress over a very short temperature interval .    to emphasize the relevance of the temporal scaling we simulated steady flow states at different external strain rates but at the same @xmath94 values .",
    "the result are shown in fig .",
    "[ strainratedependence ] .",
    "we see that as the temperature increases , the relative sensitivity of the flow stress to changes in the the strain rate increases appreciably .",
    "note that the value of @xmath89 for which the data collapse was demonstrated is well within the range of high sensitivity to changes in the strain rate .",
    "in other words , without rescaling the strain rate properly there is no hope for data collapse .",
    "further analytic properties of the scaling function are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the entire physics of the steady flow state for this class of systems is encoded in the scaling function @xmath92 .",
    "it is therefore very challenging to derive the form of this functions from first principles .",
    "we are not yet in a position to do so ; at this point we can only present the analytic properties of this function as a preparation for future discussions .",
    "firstly , it is noteworthy that the limits @xmath96 and @xmath97 do not commute .",
    "we expect that @xmath98 simply because at any finite temperature , given enough time to relax the stress , the flow stress must vanish @xcite . on the other hand @xmath99 as can be seen directly from fig .",
    "[ sofx ] .",
    "secondly , in the athermal limit @xmath100 the flow stress loses its dependence on the external strain rate for sufficiently small values of @xmath101 , @xmath102 this property can be seen directly in fig .",
    "[ strainratedependence ] .",
    "the physical reason for this property is that without substantial thermal activation the physics becomes insensitive to external time scales .",
    "this limit is expected to hold when the external strain rate is much smaller than the elastic relaxation rate ; interplays between high strain rates and the flow stress were investigated in @xcite .",
    "finally , we observe an inflection point in @xmath92 , see fig .",
    "[ sofx ] , where @xmath103 we conjecture that this inflection point separates a  low temperature region \" from a  high temperature region \" in which the elasto - plastic physics is not the same .",
    "it is possible that a change from delocalized plastic events to more localized events @xcite is the fundamental reason for this change , but further study is necessary to pinpoint this issue in a convincing way .",
    "at this point it is appropriate to discuss the general applicability of the scaling approach .",
    "it is sufficient to delineate this applicability in the context of the athermal , quasi - static limit using systems in which the inter - particle potential can not be usefully approximated as inverse power laws . in some model systems , e.g. @xcite , it has been shown that density scaling of the dynamics of super - cooled liquids still holds in spite of the presence of attractive forces in the potential .",
    "furthermore , the same qualitative density scaling has been applied to a wide variety of experimental data , with substantial success @xcite . in these experimental systems",
    "there are definitely attractive forces between the particles , and thus the question of the applicability of the scaling theory is highly pertinent .",
    "we have simulated systems with the potential @xmath104 , eq .",
    "( [ newpot ] ) in the athermal , quasi - static limit . in this potential",
    "an attractive branch is added to the repulsive one , see fig .",
    "[ potentialsfig ] .",
    "we again prepared 20 independent runs for each of the 7 densities @xmath105 and 1.6 , this time for systems of @xmath106 particles , and collected statistics for the steady state stress values ( see methods section ) , as previously described .",
    "the raw data of the stress - strain curves is displayed in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ noscaling ] . in the right upper panel",
    "we show what happens when we try to collapse the data by rescaling the stress by @xmath107 .",
    "of course the stress - stain curves now all asymptote to the same value , but the curves fail to collapse , since @xmath108 does not scale in the same way as @xmath107 . nevertheless , even in the present case we can have predictive power for high densities .",
    "when the density increases the repulsive part of the potential ( [ newpot ] ) becomes increasingly more relevant , and the inner power law @xmath109 becomes dominant .",
    "we therefore expect that for higher densities scaling will be regained , and both @xmath107 and @xmath110 would depend on the density as @xmath111 .",
    "the two lower right panels in fig .",
    "[ noscaling ] show how well this prediction is realized also in the present case .      another way of flushing out the failure of scaling when there exist attractive forces is provided by the ratio @xmath112 this is a pure number , which has been claimed to be universal for a family of metallic glasses @xcite . for systems in which our scaling analysis holds ,",
    "we have seen that the shear modulus scales with density in exactly the same manner as the yield stress ( see eq .  ( [ ysscaling]),([smscaling ] ) ) , hence the number @xmath113 should be invariant to density changes , for a given system .",
    "however , when compared across different systems , there is no a - priori reason to expect this number to be universal .",
    "[ omegafig ] displays the measured values of @xmath113 for our athermal , quasi - static experiments , for two different repulsive potentials of the form ( [ potential ] ) , using @xmath51 and @xmath53 , and for the attractive potential ( [ newpot ] ) , with @xmath16 . for the two repulsive potentials , we find from our numerics that this parameter differs by about 5% , indicating non - universality .",
    "the lack of universality is even clearer with the last potential ( [ newpot ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that when scaling prevails the value of @xmath113 is constant up to numerical fluctuations . in the third case , where scaling fails",
    ", @xmath113 is a strong function of @xmath54 except at higher densities where scaling behavior is recaptured as explained .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the approximate constancy of @xmath113 found in a family of metallic glasses @xcite , is not fundamental but only an indication of the similarity of the potentials for this family .",
    "in general @xmath113 can depend on the inter - particle potential .",
    "it is quite clear from considering eqs .",
    "( [ moo2 ] ) , ( [ ysscaling ] ) and ( [ smscaling ] ) , that the _ coefficients _ in the scaling laws ( [ ysscaling ] ) and ( [ smscaling ] ) may well depend on the exponent @xmath10 in the repulsive part of the potential .",
    "the ratio of these pre - factors , being a pure number , could be independent of @xmath10 , and @xmath113 could be universal .",
    "it appears however that @xmath110 is increasing more with @xmath10 than @xmath107 , and therefore @xmath113 shows a clear increase upon increasing @xmath10 . at present",
    "this must remain an interesting riddle for future research .",
    "the destruction of scaling for low - density systems with the attractive potential ( [ newpot ] ) is in apparent contradiction to density scaling analysis of relaxation times in supercooled liquids .",
    "as mentioned above , it has been shown in the context of the dynamics of supercooled liquids , both in model systems and in experiments , that the presence of attractive forces in the pairwise potentials can still be consistent with density scaling . in our context of mechanical properties scaling",
    "is regained only at high densities ; it is desirable to understand whether there is a qualitative difference between the influence of attractive forces on mechanical properties , and the influence of attractive forces on the dynamics of supercooled liquids .",
    "the standard way in which density scaling is presented in the context of the dynamics of supercooled liquids is in the form @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the @xmath116-relaxation time and @xmath117 is a scaling function of one rescaled variable ; the exponent @xmath118 corresponds to @xmath119 in our scaling analysis .    in our opinion",
    "this form can not be exact , and we propose now an alternative form in light of the analysis presented above .",
    "the form ( [ supercooledscaling ] ) account only for the density scaling of the free - energy barriers for thermal activation .",
    "we have noted above that on top of this the microscopic time - scale @xmath73 , with respect to which rates are compared , also varies with density , see eq .",

    "( [ tau0 ] ) ) . combining these considerations ,",
    "we obtain the scaling form @xmath123    we believe that this correct form was missed because the scaling of thermal activation barriers appears in the exponent of the rhs of ( [ tst ] ) , whereas the scaling of the microscopic time scale is in the pre - factor .",
    "nevertheless it is our suggestion that data should be re - analyzed using the proper form of the scaling function .",
    "in this paper we offered some modest inroads into providing a theory for elasto - plastic dynamics .",
    "we must admit that a complete theory of elasto - plastic response of amorphous solids is still out of reach , mainly because of some fundamental riddles that are highly debated .",
    "our proposition in this paper is that understanding the steady plastic flow state is firstly simpler than and secondly mandatory for achieving a full theory of elasto - plasticity . by focusing on glass formers with simple effective inverse power - law potentials we achieved a scaling theory for the steady - state flow stress under constant strain rate and finite temperatures .",
    "we have shown that in the athermal , quasi - static limit the yield stress exhibits power - law dependence on the density , as does the shear modulus .",
    "it was then shown that temperature and external strain rate can be incorporated into the scaling approach by accounting for thermal activation effects via energy scaling , and rate effects via temporal scaling .",
    "the finite temperature and finite strain rate theory appears in excellent agreement with the athermal , quasi - static limit when the appropriate limits are taken .",
    "the first task ahead is to provide an understanding from first principles of the scaling function @xmath124 .",

    "probably the most intriguing of these is the inflection point in @xmath124 , see eq .",
    "( [ inflectionpoint ] ) and the corresponding discussion .",
    "understanding the origin of this inflection point may shed light on the possibility of constructing mean field theories of plasticity at least for steady states , including the external parameter regimes for which they might be valid .",
    "probably the most important remaining issue is the identification of additional state - variable that are necessary to describe transient states .",
    "it is well known that after straining in one direction and reaching a steady state , a change in straining direction with an angle with respect to the original direction results in angle dependent trajectories .",
    "this means that a tensorial order parameter is written into the material during the steady flow state , and this object does not appear in our analysis .",
