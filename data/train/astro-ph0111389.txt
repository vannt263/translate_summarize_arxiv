    "the highly successful parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( pm survey ) and other recent surveys have used the 20-cm multibeam receiver on the parkes telescope for pulsar searches ( e.g. , manchester et al .",
    "2001 ; crawford et al .",
    "apart from the advantages of the multiple beams and good raw sensitivity of this receiver , deleterious pulse scattering and dispersion smearing effects are greatly reduced at the high observing frequency .",
    "this instrument is therefore good for finding fast , distant pulsars which may have been missed in previous low - frequency surveys .",
    "we have used the multibeam receiver and the parkes telescope to search young objects for radio pulsars .",
    "the list of objects is shown in table 1 and includes supernova remnants ( snrs ) , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , fast x - ray pulsars , and a soft gamma repeater ( sgr ) . in the search",
    ", we used the center beam of the multibeam receiver at a center frequency of 1374 mhz .",
    "integration times of 16800 s were typically used with 0.25 ms sampling and 288 mhz of bandwidth split into 96 channels . during processing",
    ", data were dedispersed at trial dispersion measures ( dms ) ranging from 0 to 3000 pc @xmath1 , frequency channels were summed , and each resulting time series was filtered then fourier transformed to get an amplitude spectrum for each dm trial .",
    "candidate periods were identified in the spectra , and the original data were dedispersed and folded at these periods .",
    "the flux sensitivity limits of the searches in all cases are @xmath2 mjy at 1374 mhz ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these limits were estimated using the survey sensitivity modeling described in crawford ( 2000 ) and manchester et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and they took into account estimates of dm , scattering , and sky temperature , as well as instrumental effects . for those objects for which no _ a priori _ period was known ,",
    "@xmath3 ms was assumed in the sensitivity calculations .",
    "the flux sensitivity limits in all cases are better than those previously reported for these objects",
    ". however , they depend on assumptions about pulsed duty cycle , period , dm , and scattering effects .",
    "we obtained upper limits at 1374 mhz for most objects ( table 1 ) , and discovered three new radio pulsars in the search .",
    "these discoveries are presented in table 2 and are described below .",
