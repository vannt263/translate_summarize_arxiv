    "the abundance of chemical elements in the atmosphere of a star is traditionally determined from the values of equivalent widths of spectral lines with the use of completely computer - aided methods .",
    "such methods allow a large number of lines of different elements to be quickly processed .",
    "they are convenient and widely used in practice .",
    "for example , in the recent paper by scott et al . , new estimates of the abundance of chemical elements in the solar atmosphere were obtained from the values of the equivalent widths . however ,",
    "for many stars , this approach sometimes yields unreliable results . in those cases when the stellar spectrum looks like a paling of many lines , a specified interval of the spectrum",
    "is synthesized , and the profiles of the selected lines rather than the equivalent widths are analyzed .",
    "such a synthesis requires the data on the atomic parameters of all of the lines in the interval ; however , as a rule , they are far from always well known .",
    "moreover , not all of the weak lines have been identified so far .",
    "if individual spectral lines can be isolated in the observed spectrum , the synthesis of their profiles may yield reliable results in the analysis of the chemical composition of stars .    as was shown in our previous study @xcite , to determine the abundance , only those regions of the profile that are most sensitive to it rather than the whole line profile can be used .",
    "such an approach is especially urgent in those cases when one wing of the profile is strongly blended , or the intensity in a red wing of the line is obviously insufficient , or the continuum can not be unambiguously determined due to the absorption in many weak lines , or there is a strong deviation from the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) in the line core .",
    "the new approach suggested by sheminova and cowley @xcite allows the abundance to be accurately obtained when the equivalent widths of lines and their complete profile can not be reliably measured .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to determine the abundance of iron in the atmosphere of arcturus with a high accuracy from those parts of the profiles of spectral lines that are most sensitive to the abundance .",
    "to determine the abundance as accurate as possible from adjusting the shapes of the profiles of spectral lines , it is very important to select proper lines from the stellar spectrum .",
    "it is stressed in @xcite that the weak lines with the central depths @xmath5% ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radiation fluxes in the line and continuum , respectively ) are most suitable for determining the abundances .",
    "it is well known that the weaker the absorption line , the less sensitive its profile to the microturbulent velocity @xmath8 . as a rule",
    ", this parameter can be estimated with a poor accuracy , and the uncertainty in its value directly influences the abundance estimate .",
    "the tests showed that the profiles of weak lines with @xmath9 less than 10% are practically indifferent to the change of the velocity @xmath10 .",
    "they are most suitable for determining the abundance .",
    "the use of the line profiles with the central depths of 1020% and 2030% may yield the error in the abundance of approximately @xmath11  dex and @xmath12  dex , respectively , if @xmath8 changes by @xmath13  km / s .",
    "the profiles of moderate lines ( @xmath9 varies from 30 to 60% ) are most sensitive to @xmath8 , because of which their synthesis requires accurate values of the microturbulent velocity for each of the lines .",
    "note that the profiles of weak lines are also less sensitive to the damping effects . due to this",
    ", the selection of lines with @xmath14% may substantially reduce the influence of the ambiguity in the parameters @xmath8 and damping constant .",
    "the profiles of weak lines are substantially influenced by such parameters as the macroturbulent velocity @xmath15 , the rotation velocity of a star @xmath16 , the abundance of the element @xmath17 , and the oscillator strengths @xmath18 of a specified line . among the listed parameters , except the abundance , the parameter @xmath18 is most crucial .",
    "the oscillator strengths influence the line profiles in the same way as the abundance does , and it is difficult to separate their effects .",
    "the only way to obtain a correct value of the abundance is to choose the lines for which this parameter is known as accurately as possible . naturally , it is desirable that the oscillators strengths are obtained from laboratory experiments .",
    "it is of particular importance that the lines used in the synthesis have at least one wing or a large part of a wing that is free of blending .",
    "if there are no obvious blends in the wings , though the line is strongly asymmetric , this asymmetry may be caused by the influence of very weak blends .",
    "only experience may show what lines can be used for determining the exact value of the abundance and what lines can not .",
    "thus , to select the absorption lines of fe i and fe ii , we used the following criteria :    \\(1 ) the depth @xmath9 in the center of a line should be less than 0.3 ;    \\(2 ) the profiles should contain the regions that are free of blends ;    \\(3 ) the parameters @xmath18 should be measured in laboratory with a high accuracy .    to determine the value of the iron abundance in the atmosphere of arcturus relative to the solar one as exactly as possible , the same lines in the spectra of arcturus and the sun were selected . in this case",
    ", the accuracy in the oscillator strengths will produce no effect on the relative abundance .",
    "first , the lines in the spectrum of arcturus were chosen from the spectral atlas of hinkle and wallace @xcite ; then , the same lines were checked in the spectrum of the sun as a star .",
    "the spectral atlas @xcite contains the normalized spectrum of the flux of arcturus and the sun as a star that was measured with a high signal - to - noise ratio and a high spectral resolution ( 150000 and 300000 for arcturus and the sun , respectively ) in the visible range .    to retrieve the value of the absolute abundance of iron in the atmosphere of arcturus as accurately as possible ,",
    "the data on the oscillator strengths of the weak lines of fe i were taken from a paper of fuhr and wiese @xcite that contains only the experimental data divided into five ranges by accuracy ( @xmath19 , 10 , 25 , 50 , and @xmath20% ) .",
    "we used only the data with the accuracy of @xmath21 and @xmath22% .",
    "the oscillator strengths for the fe ii lines were taken from a paper of melendez and barbuy that contains the most reliable data currently available .",
    "note , in the spectrum of arcturus , many weak lines are partially blended or subjected to the `` line haze '' effect more strongly than those in the solar spectrum . to take this into consideration , at least partly , in the synthesis of the profile of a specified line",
    ", we calculated all of the blends .",
    "their list , together with their atomic numbers , was taken from the atomic spectral line database by r. kurucz ( cd - rom 23 , http://www.pmp.uni-hannover.de/cgi-bin/ssi/test/kurucz/sekur.html ) .",
    "nevertheless , we failed to satisfactorily reproduce the observed profiles for all of the selected lines .",
    "the use of the list of spectral lines from the vienna atomic line database ( vald ) did not allow the problem of lacking lines to be solved either .",
    "this fact shows that the lists of lines are probably incomplete or the accuracy in the atomic parameters of lines is insufficient .",
    "consequently , the number of the weak lines satisfying the above listed requirements turned out to be not so large .",
    "table 1 presents a list of the weak lines selected for determining the iron abundance in the atmospheres of arcturus and the sun .",

    "the most optimal version is the isotropic model of microturbulence and the radial - tangential model of macroturbulence .",
    "moreover , the micro- and macroturbulent velocities do not change with depth in the atmosphere .",

    "the fitting of the profiles in the wing is restricted to approximately 5% .",
    "one more cause of probable uncertainties in the fitting is the asymmetry of profiles .",
    "sometimes we had to choose only one wing ( more frequently , a blue one ) of the line for fitting .",
    "our experience showed that the blue wing is less deflected by photospheric convective motions than the red one .",

    "this fact can be noticed when comparing the observed , usually asymmetric , profiles to the symmetric synthesized profiles obtained in the frames of the 1d atmospheric models .",
    "the observed line profile results from the averaging by space and time .",
    "it can be hypothesized that the lines formed in different parts of the disk , where the temperatures and velocities along the line of sight are different , will differ in shift , width , and shape .",
    "because of this , the resultant profile , which is averaged over the disk , will be asymmetric and shifted by the wavelength .",
    "the shape and the shift of the profile may also be influenced by other factors , such as spots , oscillations , and pulsations .",
    "however , the main cause of the asymmetry of absorption lines in the stars of the fgk spectral classes is the convection penetrating into the photosphere .",

    "in addition , we will pay attention to the known fact ( especially for the sun ) that the results for the iron abundance obtained from the lines of neutral and ionized iron are different .",
    "rather large differences can be seen in the data of the other studies ( table 3 ) , from 0.05 to 0.12 . in our case , this difference is 0.03 .",

    "the non - lte effects reduce the abundance by 0.01 dex ( the data from @xcite in table 3 ) . as is shown by holzreuter and solanki , the accounting for the combined effect of the horizontal radiation transfer and the non - lte approximation on the iron lines in the realistic 3d atmospheres will reduce the iron abundance by approximately 0.012 dex .",
    "the choice of the list of lines may cause a difference of 0.04 dex ( the data from @xcite in table 2 ) .",
    "it is also seen from table 3 that the difference between the values of the iron abundance derived from the analysis of the fe i and fe ii lines may be rather large , from 0.01 to 0.09 dex .",
    "it depends on both the choice of the spectral lines and the atmospheric model . in the cooler photospheres ( e.g. , marcs ) , this difference is 0.010.02 dex , while it reaches 0.05 dex in the hotter ones ( e.g. , hm @xcite ) . in our case ,",
    "the difference between the values obtained from the fe i and fe ii lines is minimum ( 0.01 dex ) .",
    "the iron abundance obtained from the observations of the disk center and for the sun as a star may differ to a little degree .",
    "for example , it follows from paper of caffau et al .",
    "@xcite that , for the sun as a star , the 3d models yield the abundance 0.02 dex lower than for disk center .     in dependence on the parameter of microturbulence @xmath8 for artificial absorption lines of different strengths calculated for the sun as a star .",
    "]    the abundance derived from the equivalent widths and 1d models depends on the choice of the parameter of microturbulence .",
    "the uncertainty in this parameter may lead to different equivalent widths of the synthesized lines and , consequently , to different values of the abundance .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates how the equivalent widths of the synthesized lines ( weak , moderate , and strong ) may differ if the value of the microturbulence parameter 1 km / s is changed within the limits of @xmath13  km / s .",
    "as is seen , the equivalent widths of very weak lines are practically constant under such variations of microturbulence .",
    "the situation becomes more problematic for moderate lines ( partially saturated lines ) . to choose the",
    "microturbulence parameter properly is of key importance for calculations of these lines in the analysis of the abundances .",
    "for example , if a moderate line with the equivalent width @xmath79  pm for the sun as a star is synthesized with the value of 0.7 km / s instead of the standard value of 1 km / s , the derived abundance will be 0.09 dex higher , and the difference will be even larger for a moderate line with @xmath80  pm .",
    "the uncertainty in the microturbulence parameter , together with the rotation velocity of the star , influences the shape of the profiles and may introduce an error to the abundance value obtained from the line profiles . according to our calculations for weak lines , the increase of the macroturbulent velocity @xmath81 from 3.0 to 3.5 km",
    "/ s makes the abundance higher by 0.02 dex , while the twofold increase of the classic damping constant due to collision processes yields a small increase of the abundance , 0.01 dex . in the 3d models of the atmospheres , there is no problem with micro- and macroturbulent velocities , though they have their own problems and complexities .",
    "moreover , it is not easy to apply the 3d models to the analysis of the abundance in stellar atmospheres , and their use for synthesizing the spectral lines is time consuming .",
    "if we sum ( with no sign ) the above - listed possible errors in the estimate of the iron abundance , we will find the maximally possible total error , 0.40.5 dex .",
    "this error is very large , and it may appear only in rare cases when the base list of lines and the atomic and atmospheric parameters are poorly selected . in real practice ,",
    "some errors are compensated , which results in a lower total error .    recently , scott et al .",
    "have redefined the chemical composition for the sun with the use of the solar spectrum in the disk center and the 3d models accounting for the correction for deviation from lte . for iron",
    ", they obtained the value @xmath82 , and they recommend that it should be used as the most reliable value currently available .",
    "they also report the abundance value of @xmath83 obtained with the marcs models .",
    "in fact , both our and their values of the iron abundance obtained with the 1d marcs models of the atmosphere are the same within the analysis errors .",
    "this confirms the reliability of our result .",
    "moreover , this allows us to estimate the correction for horizontal inhomogeneity of the atmosphere that is ignored in our analysis .",
    "note , our method of analyzing the abundance excludes systematic errors caused by inaccuracy in the equivalent widths , non - lte effects , and uncertainties in the micro- and macroturbulent velocities and dumping constant . to transform the abundance found by scott et al .",
    "( @xmath84 for the solar center ) to the abundance for the sun as a star , we introduce the correction of @xmath85 dex and subtract our abundance value ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the result yields the highest possible systematic error for atmospheric horizontal inhomogeneity , which amounts to 0.03 dex .",
    "this means that the iron abundance determined for the sun as a star with the marcs theoretical models of the atmosphere is underestimated by 0.03 dex due to the 1d approximation .",

    "gray @xcite found the value @xmath100  km / s .",
    "the fact that our estimate is somewhat higher can be explained by two causes .",
    "the first cause is that we used weaker lines . in the atmosphere of arcturus ,",
    "the macroturbulent velocities decrease with height , while the microturbulent velocities increase due to defragmentation of large elements , lifting up . in the analysis of strong lines ,",
    "the retrieved velocities @xmath101  km / s @xcite and @xmath102  km / s @xcite are lower than ours .",
    "the second cause is that we used a new value for the rotation velocity of arcturus @xmath103  km / s @xcite , while the other studies ( see table 4 ) are based on the higher velocity @xmath104  km / s @xcite . in the procedure of adjusting the spectra , the decrease of the rotation velocity",
    "should influence the parameter @xmath105 by raising its value to some extent .",
    "if the new value of the rotation velocity is correct , we may recommend that the new value of macroturbulence @xmath106  km / s , together with the new value of rotation @xmath103  km / s , should be used in the analysis of weak lines of fe i and fe ii .",
    "since the rotation velocity is a reliable parameter for the sun , the differences between the values of macroturbulent velocity obtained by different researchers may be caused by the discrepancy in the formation depth of the lines , from which the macroturbulent velocity is determined .",
    "table 4 contains the values of @xmath107 taken from different papers .",
    "as is seen , the values of @xmath105 obtained from strong lines are smaller than those from weak lines .",
    "this is a well - known fact indicating the decrease of @xmath105 with height in the photosphere .",
    "for all of the weak lines , we obtained the mean value @xmath108  km / s .",
    "gray @xcite found @xmath109 and @xmath110  km / s for the lower and upper photosphere , respectively .",
    "the decrease of @xmath105 with height is also confirmed by our data acquired from the fe i ( @xmath111  km / s ) and fe ii ( @xmath65  km / s ) lines . from the data for the center of the solar disk contained in the tables by gurtovenko and sheminova @xcite , we estimated the mean height where these lines are formed . on the average",
    ", the weak lines of fe ii are effectively formed at the level of 146 km , while the weak lines of fe  i are formed at the level of 182 km .",
    "because of this , the values of macroturbulent velocity in the solar photosphere derived from the fe  i and fe  ii lines differ .",
    "note that arcturus does not show such difference in the values of macroturbulent velocity obtained from the same weak lines of fe i and fe ii , since the formation conditions for these lines on arcturus differ from those on the sun .",
    "arcturus is often used as a standard for studying the chemical composition of the other similar giant stars . fortunately",
    ", for arcturus , the spectrum of extremely high quality , from the uv range to the ir one , is available together with the spectrum of the sun as a star ( the atlas by hinkle and wallace @xcite ) .",
    "since arcturus is a relatively close star , the parameters of its atmosphere are known better than those of any other rgb star .",
    "because of this , it was of particular interest to apply the method of sensitive points exactly to arcturus in order to estimate the iron abundance in its atmosphere more accurately .    from the synthesis of weak spectral lines of fe i and fe ii with the marcs models of the atmosphere , we determined the absolute value of the iron abundance for arcturus ( @xmath0 ) and the sun as a star ( @xmath112 ) in the usual logarithmic scale relative to hydrogen .",
    "we also applied the differential method to determining the iron abundance relative to the sun and derived [ fe / h]@xmath113 on average .",
    "it is especially important to know a high - accuracy value of the absolute abundance of iron for the application of the differential method to the analysis of the abundance in the other stars .",
    "as fulbright et al .",
    "@xcite note , not only the compensation of errors in the oscillator strength is an advantage of the differential analysis . in a first approximation , the errors caused by different unaccounted effects in the atmospheric models , such as 3d hydrodynamics , granulation , non - lte , magnetic fields , chromospheric effects , etc . , may compensate each other when the analysis is performed with this method relative to the similar stars having rather close parameters of the atmosphere .",
    "thus , for many stars , the differential abundances can be obtained more reliably than the absolute abundances based on the atmospheric models .    for arcturus , we recommend using the absolute value of the iron abundance @xmath0 .",
    "we also recommend that the sensitive points of the profiles of preferably weak lines should be used instead of the full profile , especially in the cases when the standard method of equivalent widths can not be applied .",
