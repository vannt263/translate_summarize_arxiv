    "the expression `` jet tomography '' is often used to describe the analysis of hard perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) processes taking place inside the soft medium created in an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision .",
    "jet tomography with the aim to study properties of the medium has become one of the core observables for heavy - ion physics at rhic , and will be even more important in the lhc heavy - ion program due to the large kinematic reach of the lhc .",
    "in particular , the focus so far has usually been on the nuclear modification factor @xmath2 between high - energy hadron production in @xmath4-@xmath4 collisions and the scaled expectation from p - p collisions .",
    "the significant suppression seen in @xmath2 follows from the energy loss of the leading shower - parton caused by its interactions with the soft qcd medium , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "early computations of energy loss were based on rather schematic models of the medium , like static cylinders . in other words , they implicitly assumed that the mean density of the medium is the only relevant tomographical information reflected in observables .",
    "however , subsequent systematic studies of the role of the medium evolution model for energy loss @xcite have shown that this is not the case : both the azimuth - angle integrated @xmath2 in central collisions as well as the difference between the yields of high-@xmath5 hadrons in the reaction plane and out of the reaction plane in non - central collisions reflect the details of the medium evolution dynamics @xcite .    on the other hand , in recent years it has been realized that details of the bulk - medium evolution , in particular the momentum space asymmetries ( driven by the different pressure gradients the in - plane and out of plane directions ) , which are commonly measured as the second harmonic coefficient @xmath0 , can only be understood properly by taking initial state density fluctuations into account @xcite .",
    "this raises a question of how the averaging over many events is best performed when the medium is described using relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "the measured @xmath0 represents an average over many different events .",
    "previously it was implicitly assumed that it is sufficient to average over many different initial state geometries and run a hydrodynamical simulation once given this averaged , smooth initial state .",
    "however , state of the art models now simulate the fluid - dynamical evolution event by event ( ebye ) for every initial state , and only then average over the resulting particle spectra .",
    "one may therefore also ask to what degree the order of averaging matters when considering energy loss in a hydrodynamical background medium .",
    "an exploratory , rather schematic study of this problem has been presented in @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to study the problem in the context of more detailed ebye fluid - dynamical and energy - loss models which are constrained by a large body of data .",

    "the overall normalization constant @xmath16 , as well as the initial time @xmath17  fm for the hydrodynamical evolution , are motivated by the ekrt model @xcite as in ref .",

    "centrality classes are defined using the number of wn .",
    "we slice the distribution of the events into intervals of @xmath19 so that each interval has a certain percentage of the total events .",
    "the impact parameter varies freely in each centrality class . for simplicity",
    "we use the same centrality selection for the wn and bc profiles .",
    "we solve ideal hydrodynamical equations @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the stress - energy tensor , @xmath22 is the fluid four - velocity and @xmath23 is the pressure . we simplify the system by assuming longitudinal boost - invariance and by neglecting the net - baryon number density .",
    "both simplifications are justified since we are interested in particle production at mid - rapidity .",

    "when we study the angular dependence of the hard partons , we must define the reference plane for each event .",
    "theoretically the simplest choice would be the reaction plane defined by the impact parameter and beam axis .",
    "however , in the experiments the impact parameter is not known .",
    "thus we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and use the event plane as our reference plane .",
    "the event flow vector @xmath25 for each event is defined as @xmath26 where we sum over all particles in the event .",
    "the event plane is then calculated from the azimuthal angle of the vector @xmath25 as @xmath27 where arctan is calculated in the correct quadrant . since in our approach",
    "we have only a finite number of particles in the final state , the event plane fluctuates around the  true  event plane , which would be determined from infinitely many particles . to eliminate these fluctuations",
    "we make 200 events from each hydro run and determine the final event plane as the average of these 200 event planes .",
    "this final event plane is now very close to the  true  event plane and we can safely neglect the effects from the event plane fluctuations .",
    "the results for final hadron @xmath1 spectra and elliptic flow from this ebye hydrodynamical model with the wn profile can be found in ref .",
    "the eos used in ref .",
    "@xcite is slightly different , but as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the differences between these eos with regard to the final state hadronic observables are very small .    for comparison purposes ,",
    "we also define a `` smooth initial condition '' by averaging over 10 000 mcg configurations as described above .",
    "we do not perform any rotation of the configurations used in the averaging process , thus the event plane of the smooth initial condition scenario equals to the reaction plane .",
    "when we change from a smooth medium to a medium evolving from fluctuating initial conditions , we qualitatively expect to be sensitive to the following four main effects on the energy loss of leading partons :    * in a medium with fluctuations in the initial state , the density distribution is not smooth but divides into clusters with densities lower and higher than the average . were the suppression of high @xmath1 partons a phenomenon linear in density , this would not matter , but in the observed region @xmath2 is a non - linear function of the medium density where the effect of reducing the density is stronger than the effect of increasing the density by the same factor is a function bounded from below by zero and that complete suppression of partons corresponds to the limit of infinite medium density , i.e. a strong increase of density is needed to push the suppression below 0.2 ] . from these considerations , we can expect the suppression to weaken when fluctuations ( corresponding to a re - distribution of the smooth medium density ) are taken into account , i.e. we expect @xmath2 to increase .",
    "* regions of high and low density in the initial state lead early in the hydrodynamical evolution to sharp pressure gradients , which immediately start to smooth out the fluctuations .",
    "this process implies an irregular flow field in which the local direction of the velocity field can be quite different from the late time radial plus elliptic flow pattern .",
    "in particular , the flow vector may initially point inward to the medium center . to the degree that flow influences the strength of energy loss",
    ", this effect should be visible in the models . _ a priori _ , the sign of this effect is unknown and needs to be determined in a calculation . * in a fluctuating initial state , clusters of high density are distributed event by event around the vertices of binary collisions ( this remains true even if wounded nucleon scaling is assumed , as the position of a wounded nucleon also implies a binary collision at this transverse position ) .",
    "however , since hard parton production takes place in binary collisions , there is a marked correlation between the initial medium density distribution and the hard parton production point : hard partons tend to be produced in regions where the matter density is higher than average .",
    "this increases the suppression and is expected to lead to a decrease of @xmath2 when fluctuations are taken into account . * in principle , as discussed in @xcite , the event plane angle differs from the reaction plane angle by a certain amount in each event .",
    "if the event averaging is done relative to the reaction plane rather than the event plane , a reduction of the angular modulation of @xmath2 may result .",
    "therefore , in the averaging procedure , we make use of the event plane information .",
    "note that the hydrodynamical evolution itself smoothes the fluctuations over time , i.e. all effects listed above become weaker in the later stages of the medium evolution . on the other hand",
    ", energy loss has a characteristic length / time dependence inherent to the underlying physics model .",
    "thus it is not expected that a radiative energy loss model and an elastic energy loss model probe the initial state fluctuations in the same way .",
    "therefore , we investigate the effect of fluctuations in the medium density in two different models for leading - parton energy loss .    in order to illustrate the effect of fluctuations most clearly ,",
    "we use the following strategy : we compute the dependence of @xmath28 on the angle @xmath29 of the outgoing high-@xmath1 hadrons with the event plane in 0 - 10% central collisions for a number @xmath30 of different events with fluctuating initial conditions . for each single event ,",
    "we average over the possibility that the hard parton may emerge from any of the binary collision points associated with the event .",
    "this could be called `` ideal tomography '' , as it contains the maximum possible tomographical information that could be _ in principle _ obtained from the event ( in practice , however , it is astronomically unlikely to find a large number of high @xmath1 partons in any single event ) .",
    "this results in an @xmath31 for the event @xmath8 which illustrates the intra - event fluctuations as different directions lead to paths traversing or passing by dense regions in the medium .",
    "we compare different @xmath31 to illustrate the magnitude of the inter - event fluctuations , and define the final result as the average over the @xmath30 distinct events as @xmath32 .",
    "we determine the medium parameters characteristic for the energy loss model by the requirement that @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , we require that the result reproduces the angular average of a calculation with a smooth initial condition in which the medium parameters have been adjusted to describe the data at the same @xmath1 .",
    "we find no significant @xmath1 dependence of the fluctuation effect , which is expected as the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath2 is not very sensitive to the energy loss model @xcite .",
    "we consider three different scenarios for the fluctuations . in the standard scenario ,",
    "the initial bulk matter distribution follows the wn scaling and the characteristic size parameter @xmath15 of the fluctuations is 0.4 fm . in order to test the hypothesis that we recover the smooth initial condition result for large - sized fluctuations , we study a second scenario where @xmath34  fm .",
    "finally , in order to test the sensitivity to the assumption of the wn geometry , we repeat the study by using a bc - distributed energy density with @xmath35  fm .",
    "we use the armesto - salgado - wiedemann ( asw ) formalism in the formulation of @xcite to compute radiative energy loss . from a given binary collision vertex and with a given orientation with respect to the event plane",
    ", we compute the two line - integrals along the medium trajectory    @xmath36    and    @xmath37    we assume that the transport coefficient @xmath38 is related to the local medium energy density @xmath39 and the hydrodynamically computed local flow velocity @xmath40 @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angle between the parton trajectory and flow vector , and @xmath43 is an adjustable parameter which is determined by requiring that the model describes the angular - integrated @xmath2 in central collisions .    using the numerical results of @xcite , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "determine the energy loss probability density @xmath46 which we average at a given @xmath29 over all binary collision vertices in a given event .",
    "as explained in detail in @xcite , this procedure requires that @xmath47 along the parton trajectory can be written in the form @xmath48 . while this is obviously realized in the bjorken model of only longitudinal scaling flow , it is not self - evident that this condition is met in a hydrodynamical expansion with initial state fluctuations and buildup of transverse flow .",
    "we have however checked for a large number of trial trajectories that the leading behaviour is given by @xmath48 ( with @xmath42 dependent on the trajectory and event ) and that the deviations are of order of few percent .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the hydrodynamical evolution smoothes out strong density fluctuations very early already .",
    "we denote the resulting average probability density as @xmath49 .",
    "we calculate the momentum spectrum of hard partons in leading order ( lo ) perturbative qcd ( explicit expressions are given in @xcite and references therein ) . the medium - modified perturbative production of hadrons at an angle @xmath29",

    "is set by choosing @xmath106 in order to account for all the possible partons falling into the final rapidity window @xcite . to achieve roughly the right amount of nuclear modification in the 0 - 10% centrality bin and to emulate also the incoherent higher - order processes ,",

[ f - raa - rad-20evt ] we show one of our main results for radiative energy loss , i.e. the angular dependence of @xmath2 both for a number of events with fluctuating initial state geometry in the standard scenario and averaged over 20 different events , compared with the result for smooth , averaged initial conditions .",
    "it is readily apparent from the result that there are large inter - event fluctuations as well as somewhat smaller intra - event fluctuations . for this centrality class ,",
    "both types of fluctuations are much larger than the angular modulation induced by the spatial anisotropy of the matter distribution for the smooth initial condition .",

    "( [ e - qhat ] ) extracted from the data is to the limit of our statistical accuracy identical with the one from the smooth result , thus we do not observe any modification of the medium quenching power in this fluctuation scenario",
    ".    we may understand this finding better by considering the individual mechanisms how fluctuations may influence the outcome in detail . in fig .",
    "[ f - raa - flow ] we show the effect of the irregular flow field by comparing the full result with a result in which the flow velocity in eq .",
    "( [ e - qhat ] ) has been artificially set to zero .",
    "this means however that also the effect of the mean radial flow field which is present in the smooth result has been taken out , thus we rescale @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ e - qhat ] ) with the factor obtained from a calculation with smooth initial conditions where the flow effect is also taken out .",
    "it is readily apparent from the figure that the influence of fluctuation - induced flow on the result is small .    to demonstrate the correlation between the initial state density fluctuations and the angular behavior of @xmath2 , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ f - raa - hydro ] the initial temperature profile in the transverse plane , the bc points and , as a a polar plot , the calculated @xmath108 for the event number 4 of fig .",
    "[ f - raa - rad-20evt ] .",
    "we have also added a polar plot of @xmath109 to guide the eye .",
    "since many of the bc points are in the hot spot in the 1st quadrant , the probability to produce a hard parton from this region is large .",
    "thus a significant contribution to @xmath2 comes from partons emerging from this hot spot .",
    "if these partons are going into the direction of the event plane , they have less medium to traverse and thus do not lose as much energy as those which are moving into the opposite direction .",
    "hence the @xmath2 is larger near the event plane angle @xmath110 .    in fig .",
    "[ f - raa - bin ] we show the angular dependence of @xmath2 averaged over both randomly chosen initial binary collision points according to a smooth overlap distribution and averaged over the actual distribution of binary collision points of the event .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that accounting for the correlations of binary collision points with medium density leads to increased suppression and a reduction of @xmath2 of @xmath111% on average .",
    "these results suggest that the decrease in suppression caused by the non - linearity of the response of @xmath2 to the medium density is just compensated by the increase in suppression due to the correlation of initial vertices with dense matter regions , rendering the final result in terms of extracted medium properties almost unchanged . however , this cancellation is somewhat accidental , as will be seen in the discussion of other scenarios for the fluctuations .    in fig .",
    "[ f - raa-0_10 ] we show the averaged angular modulation of @xmath2 for all three fluctuation scenarios discussed previously , after a 10 event average where the parameter @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ e - qhat ] ) has been adjusted to result in the best fit to the data in the 0 to 10% centrality class , zoomed into the relevant @xmath112-axis region .",
    "already a 10 event average recovers some of the angular modulation seen in a smooth event . for @xmath113 fm and wn geometry , the extracted @xmath43 is , as mentioned above , the same as in the smooth case . for @xmath114",
    "fm we extract a value that is , somewhat surprisingly , 18% smaller than in the smooth case .",
    "note that this is not a large effect , since the value of @xmath43 may change by a factor two between different hydrodynamical evolution models @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that fluctuations do not have a substantial effect on the extraction of medium parameters , but rather constitute an additional uncertainty .",
    "the value of @xmath43 in the bc geometry is 30% larger than in the smooth case , but most of this difference can be attributed to the density profile geometry rather than the fluctuation effect .",
    "vertices for hard parton production are distributed according to the bc geometry .",
    "if bulk matter is distributed according to the ( wider ) wn geometry , the mean in - medium path for hard partons is larger than if bulk matter is also distributed with the ( narrower ) bc geometry .",
    "hence quenching is on average stronger for a wn geometry , requiring a larger @xmath43 if @xmath2 is required to agree with the data .",
    "let us now turn to the consequences of fluctuations for non - central collisions . here",
    ", the angular modulation of @xmath2 is much less influenced by fluctuations and already a 10 event average recovers the sinusoidal modulation with a good accuracy .",
    "this result is expected and also seen at low @xmath1 in the computation of bulk matter @xmath0 .",
    "our results for the three different scenarios are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - raa-30_40 ] along with phenix data for @xmath115 gev and @xmath116 gev @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the normalization of the results with fluctuating initial conditions is quite different from the smooth result , although the magnitude of the angular modulation is roughly similar . in particular , small - sized fluctuations increase the normalization above the smooth result , whereas it is reassuring that a larger spatial scale for the size of the fluctuations leads back to the smooth result .",
    "since the @xmath1 dependence of the data is not smooth and in particular the 9 - 10 gev bin suffers from large statistical and systematic errors , it is not entirely clear if the data can rule out one scenario at this point .",
    "however , taking the @xmath1 average of the data , it certainly seems that the normalization found for small - sized fluctuations @xmath35 fm in the wn scenario is not supported by the data .",
    "this is an interesting result , as it would allow to constrain the typical size of initial state fluctuations .",

    "[ f - raa - rad-20evt ] , comparing the angular dependence of @xmath2 for fluctuating initial state geometry with a result for smooth initial conditions .",
    "as the individual events do not necessarily correspond to the events used in the radiative energy loss model , they are here labeled with letters instead of numbers . also , the results are for partons instead of hadrons , as the convolution with fragmentation functions requires considerable amount of simulation data and increases the statistical uncertainties , but contributes very little to the results beyond the change in normalization , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f - raa - elastic-20evt ] for the event a.    notable inter - event variation was seen in the radiative energy loss scenario , and this seems to be true also with elastic energy loss .",
    "the intra - event angular variation , however , is rather weak .",
    "the average over 20 events with fluctuating initial conditions , keeping the same value @xmath117 for the fluctuating and smooth cases , equals the smooth initial condition scenario with fairly good accuracy , as was the case with the radiative energy loss model .",
    "this is perhaps more clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ f - raa - elastic - correlations ] , in which we also study the scenario where the starting points of high - energy partons are sampled from the nuclear overlap function @xmath118 in a medium with fluctuating initial conditions , as opposite of using binary collision vertices .",
    "this effectively removes the local correlation between the parton starting points and the regions with high energy density in the medium .",
    "one would expect this to decrease the suppression , and indeed the nuclear modification factor increases about 20% in this scenario .    moving to the non - central collisions ,",
    "we compare fig .",
    "[ f - raa - elastic-3040 ] with fig .  [ f - raa-30_40 ] . as in the radiative energy loss scenario ,",
    "the average of the events with fluctuating initial conditions is found to be systematically above the smooth initial conditions curve .",
    "the difference between the two curves is quite small in this scenario , but enough to argue that both the radiative and the elastic energy loss models see a difference between the smooth and the fluctuating initial conditions in the peripheral case .",
    "we have presented a systematic study of the effects of qcd - matter density fluctuations on the angular dependence of the nuclear modfication factor @xmath2 , comparing a radiative and an elastic energy loss model . in general , the overall effects of fluctuations on @xmath2 observables seem to be rather small .    in central collisions , an extraction of medium parameters in the radiative energy - loss model resulted in a difference of only @xmath119 % for the different fluctuation size - scales studied .",
    "for the default fluctuation scenario , the 20-event average reproduced both the normalization and the angular modulation of @xmath2 of the smooth scenario with unchanged medium parameter @xmath43 .",
    "this is due a cancellation of the increased suppression due to the correlation of parton production points with the hot spots , and a decrease of the suppression due the nonlinearity of @xmath2 with respect to the medium density . for non - central collisions , however , we find that this cancellation is incomplete , and as a result the angular - integrated @xmath2 depends visibly on the fluctuation size , whereas the amplitude of the angular modulation is roughly the same as in the smooth scenario",
    ". this observation may help in constraining the size - scale of the initial qcd - matter density fluctuations .",
    "the results from the radiative and the elastic energy loss models seem to agree on qualitative level , even though the weak sensitivity of the elastic energy loss model to the angle - dependent observables already seen in @xcite is clearly seen also in this research . in the central collisions ,",
    "no difference is seen between the fluctuating and the smooth initial conditions when the average over 20 events has been taken . however , as in the case of radiative energy loss , in the peripheral collisions the fluctuating conditions appear to produce somewhat smaller suppression compared to the smooth background .",

    "[ f - raa-30_40 ] would suggest a fairly large size for the fluctuations ( the @xmath34  fm case agrees better with the phenix data ) , the recent study on the effects of fluctuations on thermal photon production @xcite would favor a smaller fluctuation size .",
    "thus a combined analysis has a strong potential to constrain the initial state fluctuation scale size and thus to identify the underlying physics mechanisms for the bulk qcd - matter production .",
