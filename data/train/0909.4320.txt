    "the total - variation _ cutoff phenomenon _ describes a sharp transition in the @xmath0-mixing of a finite ergodic markov chain : over a negligible time period , the distance of the chain from equilibrium drops abruptly from near its maximum to near @xmath11 .",
    "though believed to be widespread , including many important families of chains arising from statistical physics , cutoff has been rigorously shown only in relatively few cases ( ones where the stationary distribution is completely understood and has many symmetries , e.g.  uniform on the symmetric group ) .",
    "here we establish cutoff for glauber dynamics for the ising model , one of the most studied models in mathematical physics .    already establishing",

    "this essentially remained to be the case , and present technology ( e.g. , representation theory , spectral theory , techniques for analyzing 1-dimensional chains , etc . ) does not suffice for proving cutoff in high - dimensional chains with limited understanding of their stationary distribution , such as glauber dynamics for the ising model ( stochastic ising model ) on the 3-dimensional lattice .    introduced in 1963 @xcite , glauber dynamics for the ising model on the lattice ( see section  [ sec : intro - previous ] for formal definitions ) is one of the most practiced methods to sample the gibbs distribution , and an extensively studied dynamical system in itself , having a rich interplay of properties with the static stationary distribution .",
    "for instance , as we describe in section  [ sec : intro - previous ] , it is known that on @xmath12 , at the critical inverse - temperature @xmath13 for uniqueness of the static gibbs distribution , the spectral gap of the markov semigroup generator of the glauber dynamics exhibits a phase - transition from being uniformly bounded to tending to @xmath11 exponentially fast in @xmath1 .",
    "it is further known that at high temperatures on @xmath14 this dynamics mixes in time @xmath2 , yet the precise asymptotics of the @xmath0-mixing time were unknown even in the one - dimensional case : it is an open problem of peres ( cf .",

    "the only underlying geometry for which cutoff for the ising model had so far been established is the complete graph ( @xcite ) , where the high symmetry reduces the analysis to a birth - and - death magnetization chain .",

    "ever since its introduction in 1925 , the static properties of the ising model and its gibbs states , and more recently the glauber dynamics for this model , have been the focus of intensive research .",

    "this in particular established @xmath2 mixing throughout the uniqueness regime in two - dimensions . see the excellent surveys @xcite for further details .    to conclude this collection of seminal papers that altogether established @xmath2 mixing throughout the regime of strong spatial mixing , it remains to pinpoint the asymptotics of the mixing time and determine whether or not there is cutoff in this regime .    the cutoff phenomenon was first identified for random transpositions on the symmetric group in @xcite , and for the riffle - shuffle and random walks on the hypercube in @xcite .",

    "there , the magnetization ( sum - of - spins ) is in fact a one - dimensional markov chain whose mixing and cutoff govern that of the entire dynamics .",

    "similarly , the choice of periodic boundary conditions is not a prerequisite for establishing cutoff , though it does enables us to determine the mixing time in terms of the infinite - volume spectral gap . for _ arbitrary _ boundary conditions we can still establish the existence of cutoff and in various special cases ( e.g.  under the all - plus boundary conditions ) we can pinpoint its location as stated by the following results of the companion paper @xcite .
