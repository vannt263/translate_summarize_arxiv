    "entanglement distillation is one of the most fundamental processes of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is an integral part of many protocols and devices like quantum repeaters and it provides important procedures to measure the entanglement content of a given physical system . in the usual setup",
    "it is assumed that two distant parties  alice and bob  share a large number of ( weakly ) entangled pairs of particles , and the task is to generate a ( possibly small ) amount of highly ( or even maximally ) entangled pairs by means of local operations and classical communication . in this context",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the particles shared by alice and bob are _ distinguishable _ : firstly there is a clear distinction between particles controlled by alice and those controlled by bob .",
    "secondly many distillation protocols require the selection of particular pairs by alice and bob ( e.g. to perform filtering operations ) .",
    "hence even the local particles needs to be distinguishable .    at a first glance it therefore appears to be completely impossible to talk about entanglement distillation with fermions , because the latter are by definition _",
    "undistinguishable_. a second thought reveals , however , very quickly that this is only an apparent difficulty .",
    "the only thing we have to drop is the focus on particles .",
    "instead we have to consider setups where alice and bob control independent subsystems ( usually distinguished by their position in space ) of a larger physical system .",
    "a typical example is a fermi gas from which alice and bob want to distill entanglement by using only operations ( together with classical communication ) which are localized in spatially separated regions ( e.g. alice s and bob s laboratories ) .",
    "mathematically such a situation is most easily described in terms of operator algebras . in other words , instead of using tensor products of hilbert spaces , we describe bipartite systems by specifying which local observables are measurable by alice and which by bob .",
    "this approach is successfully applied to the study of entanglement of infinite degrees of freedom systems @xcite and for the analysis of separable @xcite and maximally entangled @xcite states of fermionic systems ( cf . also the references in @xcite for more literature on fermionic entanglement ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study entanglement distillation in the same framework . in this context",
    "we will show that distillation from fermions can be treated basically in the same way as ordinary distillation with only some small changes which mainly arise from the emergence of super selection rules .",
    "in addition we will present an explicit scheme which can be applied to any quasi - free state and which allows explicit calculations ( e.g. of distillation rates ) for fairly large systems , such as ( subsystems of ) infinite quasi - free lattice models .",
    "let us start with a short look on standard distillation techniques .",
    "hence assume that alice and bob share @xmath0 @xmath1-level systems in the joint state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes a density matrix on the hilbert space @xmath4 , @xmath5 . to generate maximally entangled qubit pairs from these resources",
    "they can proceed as follows :    1 .   look for ( and drop ) unentangled subsystems .",
    "mathematically this means to find a unitary @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and to apply the transformation @xmath8 .",
    "the final state @xmath9 should contain ( almost ) as much entanglement as the original @xmath3 .",
    "in other words : @xmath10 and @xmath11 has to be chosen appropriately .",
    "2 .   find a maximally entangled state @xmath12 such that @xmath13 the best choice would be to take the @xmath14 which maximizes this fidelity . to be successful here",
    "the first step is in many cases mandatory , because a state can be entangled without satisfying inequality ( [ eq:1 ] ) for any maximally entangled @xmath14 .",
    "this can be easily seen if we choose @xmath15 and @xmath16 since we get @xmath17 , which can be arbitrarily small ( if @xmath18 is big enough ) although @xmath3 is distillable .",
    "3 .   consider the group @xmath19 and average over it .",
    "this leads to the _ twirl _ operation given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the haar measure on @xmath22 .",
    "the output of the channel @xmath23 is an isotropic state @xmath24 with @xmath25 $ ] given in terms of the fidelity @xmath26 by @xmath27 from equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) it follows immediately that @xmath28 again satisfies the inequality @xmath29 and therefore it is distillable @xcite .",
    "5 .   now we can continue with standard techniques for isotropic states which provide us with a number @xmath30 of ( almost ) maximally entangled _ qubit _ pairs ; cf @xcite and the references therein .",
    "to study entanglement of fermionic systems the usual framework which relies on tensor product hilbert spaces is too narrow because indistinguishability and anti - commutation relations has to be taken into account .",
    "instead , it is more appropriate to describe the splitting of the overall system into two subsystems in terms of observables algebras .",
    "this approach was successfully applied in particular to infinite degrees of freedom systems @xcite . for our purposes a simplified ( finite dimensional ) approach is sufficient",
    ".    definition [ def:1 ] a bipartite quantum system consists of a hilbert space and two c*-algebras @xmath31 which commute elementwise ( i.e. @xmath32=0 $ ] @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "selfadjoint elements of @xmath35 and @xmath36 describe the ( projection valued ) observables of the given system which can be _ locally _ measured by alice and bob respectively .",
    "the default setup can be recovered if we have @xmath37 in terms of two hilbert spaces @xmath38 .",
    "note , however , that we have neither assumed that @xmath35 and @xmath36 together generate @xmath39 nor that @xmath36 is the commutant of @xmath35 ( in contrast to @xcite ) . therefore beside ( [ eq:3 ] ) other realizations of bipartite systems are possible , even if @xmath40 is finite dimensional .",
    "a particular example arises , if @xmath41 decomposes into a direct sum @xmath42 , and if we define @xmath43 this is  as we will see  exactly the situation we have to study for a system consisting of a finite number of fermions .    to explain the latter remark consider the hilbert space @xmath10 and the corresponding antisymmetric fockspace @xmath44 . for each @xmath45 we can define the usual creation and annihilation operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 on @xmath40 , which satisfy the canonical anti - commutation relations ( @xmath48 denotes the anti - commutator ) @xmath49 in some cases it is more convenient to combine @xmath50 and @xmath51 in one operator",
    "( this is called the self - dual formalism @xcite ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes complex conjugation in an appropriately chosen ( and fixed ! ) basis .",
    "now we get from ( [ eq:5 ] ) @xmath54 the set of operators @xmath55 generates a c*-algebra @xmath56 which is called the algebra of canonical ani - commutation relations .",
    "it can be regarded as the closure ( in operator norm ) of the algebra of polynomials in the @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "now consider the parity operator on @xmath40 which is given in terms of the number operator @xmath0 by @xmath57 .",
    "it acts as the identity on the subspace @xmath58 of vectors with an even particle number and as minus the identity on the complementary subspace @xmath59 .",
    "we write @xmath60 for the corresponding projections and get @xmath61 the elements of @xmath62 which commute with @xmath63 are called _ even elements _ and they form the _ even subalgebra _ @xmath64 = 0 \\}\\ ] ] of @xmath62 .",
    "it can be regarded as the ( closure of ) the algebra of _ even _ polynomials in @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath10 is finite dimensional @xmath62 coincides with @xmath39 , i.e. it is a full matrix algebra .",
    "the even subalgebra however is given by @xmath65 this can be easily seen from the fact that a product of an _ even number _ of creation and annihilation operators can change the particle number only by a factor of 2 .    the next step is to decompose @xmath10 into an `` alice '' and a `` bob '' subspace , i.e. @xmath66",
    ". then we can associate to @xmath67 the corresponding fockspaces @xmath68 , and also the car - algebras @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "obviously we have @xmath71 and similarly @xmath62 is isomorphic to @xmath72 if we consider the spatial tensor product .",
    "the corresponding isomorphism satisfies @xmath73 where the @xmath74 denote the annihilation operators and @xmath75 the parity operators on @xmath41 .",
    "the latter are related to the global parity @xmath63 by @xmath76 equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) shows that @xmath69 can not both be embedded as tensor factors into @xmath62 without violating the anti - commutation relations . the construction given in ( [ eq:6 ] )",
    "is therefore called the _ twisted _ tensor product of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the discussion of the last paragraph has shown that two operators @xmath79 , @xmath80 do not commute in general and therefore these two algebras can not be chosen as the observable algebras @xmath35 and @xmath36 . if we choose , however , @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be even elements we immediately get from ( [ eq:6 ] ) that @xmath32=0 $ ] holds .",
    "hence @xmath83 is an appropriate choice for the _ local _ observable algebras of alice and bob .",
    "together they define a bipartite fermionic system in the sense of definition [ def:1 ] if @xmath84 and @xmath85 are finite dimensional we can insert equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) for @xmath35 and @xmath36 and we recover the example already given in ( [ eq:3 ] ) . note in addition that @xmath86 and @xmath87 holds , while the _ full _ car algebras fail to have this property  by virtue of equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "hence it is reasonable to consider @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) as alice s ( bob s ) hilbert space .",
    "on top of the scheme described in the last section all basic notions of entanglement theory can be reconstructed .",
    "this was done for separable states in @xcite and for maximally entangled states in @xcite . to discuss entanglement distillation",
    "we need the concept of a local operation which can be defined as follows ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    definition [ def:2 ] consider two bipartite systems @xmath90 , @xmath91 . an operation ( i.e. a completely positive map ) @xmath92 is called _ local _ if @xmath93 and @xmath94 holds .    in the standard framework ( [ eq:3 ] ) with finite dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath38 ( or",
    "if we assume that the operation @xmath95 is normal ) this definition coincides with the usual one .",
    "note that the factorization condition ( [ eq:4 ] ) is needed to make this statement true @xcite .    to generalize the distillation protocol from section [ sec : entangl - dist ]",
    "only a few special local operations are needed .",
    "they are summarized in the following list .    *",
    "_ local unitaries . _",
    "the easiest case is a local unitary transformation @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) unitary on @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath100 is equivalent to @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "a similar statement holds for @xmath99 . * _ local bogolubov transformations .",
    "_ a special case of the previous example arises if @xmath98 and @xmath99 are related to unitaries @xmath103 , @xmath104 on @xmath105 , @xmath106 by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the operator introduced in equation ( [ eq:28 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that ( [ eq:29 ] ) is only possible if @xmath109 holds ( cf . again ( [ eq:28 ] ) ) .",
    "the condition ( [ eq:2 ] ) is on the other hand sufficient for the existence of a unitary @xmath11 satisfying ( [ eq:29 ] ) for a given @xmath110 . * _ discarding subsystems .",

    "if we denote the fockspaces of @xmath112 , @xmath91 by @xmath113 we get a decomposition of @xmath40 into a tensor product @xmath114 .",
    "if we perform the partial trace over say @xmath115 we get the fockspace @xmath116 and the corresponding reduced observable algebras @xmath117 . in this way the partial trace becomes ( the schrdinger picture version of ) a local operation between two bipartite fermionic systems , which discards the modes belonging to @xmath118 . * a _ joint parity measurement _",

    "therefore parity measurements can be done without disturbing the system .",
    "this implies immediately that the state @xmath3 can not be distinguished from the mixture @xmath128 . within a distillation scheme",
    "this instrument can be used to perform local filtering operations ; e.g. alice and bob can decide to drop the whole system if their local parities are different and to keep it otherwise .",
    "if we set @xmath129 and ignore the value of the parities ( apart from @xmath130 ) we get a ( non - unital ) local operation which transforms a bipartite fermionic system into a pair of @xmath131level systems in the state @xmath132",
    "let us now adopt the general distillation scheme sketched in section [ sec : entangl - dist ] to the fermionic case . to this end",
    "we will use throughout this section the assumptions made in equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) , which implies in particular that ( [ eq:27 ] ) holds .",
    "in addition , consider two maximally entangled vectors @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 for each @xmath136 we have @xmath137 using the terminology from equations ( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) this can be rewritten as : @xmath138 hence alice and bob can not distinguish the vector states @xmath139 from themselves and from the mixture of @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "the latter is according to @xcite a fermionic maximally entangled state ( implying in particular that eof is maximal ) .",
    "the only step from the list in section [ sec : entangl - dist ] we have to change is the twirling , because averaging over the group @xmath142 ( or @xmath143 ) breaks the superselection rule and is therefore not an allowed local operation .",
