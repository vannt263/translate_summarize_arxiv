    "charm production in high energy heavy ion collisions is one of the hot topics of both theory and experiment . because of the large mass , charm quarks",
    "are believed to be produced mainly via initial gluon fusion in the early stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "they are also regarded as a unique tool for probing the hot dense matter or quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) created in these collisions .",
    "for example , through the charm quark energy loss @xcite , charm flow @xcite and @xmath5 production ( suppression or enhancement ) @xcite , etc .",
    ", one can learn much about the qgp .",
    "since the startup of the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , phenix and star collaborations have made many measurements on charm production @xcite .",
    "the binary scaling of the total charm cross section @xmath6 has been observed by the two collaborations .",
    "however , they give quite different values of the binary scaled charm cross section @xmath7 .",
    "there are two important ratios used for obtaining @xmath7 in the experiments .",
    "one is @xmath8 used by phenix to convert the multiplicity or cross section of nonphotonic electron into the charm cross section . here",
    "@xmath9 is the number of @xmath10 pairs created in the collisions .",
    "another ratio is @xmath11 used by star in deriving @xmath7 from the yield of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 are both affected by the charm hadron ratios .",
    "the enhancement of baryon production in the intermediate @xmath0 range observed in au+au reactions at rhic suggests strongly a coalescence / recombination ( co / re ) hadronization mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can also result in an enhancement of charm baryons , so the charm hadron ratios and @xmath13 , @xmath14 in au+au collisions should be different from those in @xmath15 reactions or @xmath16 annihilations .",
    "unfortunately , these ratios can not be obtained through theory calculations model - independently , and it is now difficult to measure them directly in experiments because of the difficulty of charm hadron reconstruction in au+au collisions .",
    "the two key ratios at rhic are currently from the @xmath15 reactions or @xmath16 annihilations .",
    "then one must ask , how large are the corrections to @xmath6 from the two ratios in au+au collisions , and are the corrections able to account for the discrepancy of @xmath7 measured by the two collaborations ?    a new method is proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine @xmath7 by measuring the spectrum of nonphotonic muon , so the ratio @xmath17 , the inclusive branching ratio to muons [ ( @xmath18 in @xmath19 reactions , is also required .",
    "the charm cross section is one of the most important issues of charm physics in heavy ion collisions . according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : defrec ] ) and ( [ eq : defrdc ] ) , the accurate @xmath7 measurement depends on the accurate ratios @xmath13 and @xmath14 , so it is an important issue of charm physics to determine @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath17 and the charm hadron ratios in @xmath19 collisions .",
    "however , in most combination models , the hadronic `` combination function '' is necessary to obtain the yield of the hadron .",
    "the combination function denotes the probability for ( anti)quarks to form a hadron and is determined by the hadron wave function . as the wave functions of charm hadrons are unknown , it is difficult for these models to study the issue quantitatively .",
    "in addition , these models do not satisfy the unitarity @xcite which is important to the issue as well . by now , only one model @xcite has predicted the comprehensive charm hadron ratios at rhic and lhc within statistical framework . on the other hand ,",
    "the quark combination model ( qcm ) we developed satisfies the unitarity and has reproduced the global properties of su(3 ) hadrons without the explicit combination functions .",
    "based on the success of qcm , we further extend it to su(4 ) flavor symmetry , and qcm is then suitable for studying quantitatively the charm hadron production in heavy ion collisions .    in this paper , we quantitatively study the effects on the charm hadron ratios from the baryon enhancement and the strangeness enhancement in @xmath19 reactions within the qcm .",
    "we find the charm hadron ratios and the key ratios @xmath13 , @xmath17 are substantially different from those in the @xmath15 reactions or @xmath16 annihilations .",
    "their dependencies on energy , centrality , and some parameters are all investigated .",
    "the parameters include the yield ratio of the primary charm vector meson to the pseudoscalar meson @xmath20 , the yield ratio of primary charm decuplet baryon to octet baryon @xmath21 , the quark number ratio @xmath22 , the strangeness suppression factor @xmath23 , and so on .",
    "here @xmath23 denotes the number ratio of newly produced strange quarks to @xmath24 quarks , @xmath25 . for the first time in combination or co / re mechanism , the extensive charm hadron ratios and the total branching ratios @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath17 in @xmath19 collisions are predicted at rhic and lhc .",
    "since the dealings with hadronization are different , it is not surprising that some predictions are different from those in the statistical hadronization model @xcite .",
    "the predictions can be examined and the different hadronization mechanisms for charm hadrons can be tested in future experiments .",
    "our quark combination model ( qcm ) proposed some time ago @xcite demands that quark(s ) and/or antiquark(s ) which are nearest in rapidity combine into a hadron .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that such a demand is in agreement with the fundamental requirement of qcd and uniquely determines the quark combination rule in the hadronization process .",
    "qcm has been successfully applied to @xmath16 annihilations and @xmath15 collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , we have extended it to the rhic reactions and have reproduced the global properties of hadrons such as hadronic multiplicities , @xmath0 spectra , elliptic flows , and rapidity distributions .",
    "qcm is particularly designed for describing the hadronization in the quark co / re scheme where the properties of the constituent ( anti)quarks before hadronization are taken as inputs . in this work ,",
    "the charm quarks are supposed to be distributed randomly in the light ( anti)quark sea after the qgp evolution , and all the ( anti)quarks , including charm quarks , combine into hadrons within qcm .",
    "all the ground state hadrons , namely , 120-plet baryons and 64-plet mesons for su(4 ) quarks , are considered systematically .",
    "the higher excited states are not included .",
    "the final state hadrons are obtained after all resonances are treated through the decay subroutine in pythia6.4.16 @xcite .",
    "some details of qcm can also be seen in ref . .",
    "we determine the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath22 by fitting the two hadron ratios @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 .",
    "the other hadron ratios can be obtained accordingly with qcm .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 , a measure of the net baryon number in qgp , is taken as 0.859 , 0.915 , and 0.927 for @xmath29 , and 200 gev respectively .",
    "likewise , @xmath23 is 0.52 , 0.48 , and 0.48 for the three rhic energies , and this is consistent with the data fitting in ref .",
    "similar to the same reference , we suppose @xmath23 is saturated in @xmath19 reactions above 200 gev , that is , qgp created at lhc also has @xmath30 . assuming the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are universal in relativistic @xmath19 reactions , we use 3.0 and 0.5 as their default values in qcm at various energies , respectively .",
    "the same default value of @xmath20 is also used in pythia .    for simplicity and to reduce the uncertainty of the input , same as ref .",
    "@xcite , the bottom quarks are not considered in our calculations . according to the pqcd prediction in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bottom effects on the spectrum of nonphotonic electron are mainly manifested in a higher @xmath0 range ( @xmath31 gev ) , so we can reliably study the charm hadron multiplicities or ratios while neglecting the bottom contributions .",
    "we will not discuss charmonia production here , but will study it in a future paper , as this issue is more complicated and still under debate .",
    "spectra at 200 gev for @xmath32 meson , inclusive electron , nonphotonic electron , and muon .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) lines are from @xmath7 by star ( phenix ) .",
    "@xmath12 data tagged with ( cucu ) or ( @xmath33au ) are obtained from cu+cu or @xmath33+au collisions based on the binary scaling .",
    "data are from refs .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0%,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    since most of the data available on charm production in au+au collisions are at @xmath34 gev , we first study charm production in the top central au+au collisions at this energy . according to the experimental observation of binary scaling of the nonphotonic electron spectra in low @xmath0 range , we assume that the total charm cross section or @xmath9 in relativistic @xmath19 collisions is proportional to the nucleon - nucleon collision number @xmath35 .",
    "the assumption is consistent with the point that charm quarks are mostly produced via primary hard scattering , and the number of @xmath10 pairs @xmath9 , as input in qcm , is given by @xmath36 here the au+au charm cross section per nucleon - nucleon collision @xmath37 mb @xcite , the @xmath38 inelastic cross section @xmath39 mb and @xmath40 @xcite are adopted .",
    "then the total @xmath9 is about 35 ( 31 ) at 0 - 5% ( 0 - 10% ) centrality .",
    "the charm quark spectrum that was input as a normalized form @xmath41 is extracted by fitting the star spectra of @xmath42 and electron .",
    "the fitted spectra in fig .",
    "[ cap : oncharms ] are slightly softer than the star data considering no bottom contributions .",
    "the solid lines are from the star @xmath7 , while the dashed lines , all lower than the data , correspond to the phenix @xmath43 mb @xcite .",
    "hereafter , the star @xmath7 1.4 mb is used in all calculations at 200 gev .",
    "the @xmath0 dependencies of the charm baryon - to - meson ratios @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ cap : charmb - m_pt ] .",
    "it is clear to see that the charm baryon enhancement in intermediate @xmath0 range is very prominent , which is similar to that of the @xmath44 ratio .",
    "note that the peak of @xmath2 is even higher than @xmath3 .",
    "this is because the yield of @xmath45 is larger than @xmath46 around @xmath47 gev/@xmath48 due to the decay effect .",
    "the shapes of the @xmath0 dependencies of these ratios are dependent on the co / re mechanism , decay effect , and the charm quark spectrum obtained from fitting data shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : oncharms ] . comparing with the data of @xmath49 @xcite in the same au+au collisions",
    ", one can see that all peaks broaden and shift to the right because essentially the spectrum of the charm quark is much harder than that of the @xmath24 quark .",
    "the enhancement can certainly lead to the @xmath50 enhancement of charm baryons ( @xmath51 ) in the same @xmath0 region .",
    "it can also result in a suppression of nonphotonic lepton spectrum and thus a substantial suppression to its nuclear modification factor @xmath50 in the intermediate @xmath0 range @xcite .",
    "this is just the part of @xmath50 of nonphotonic lepton that arose from the co / re hadronization process other than the quark energy loss . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ cap : charmb - m_pt ] , our calculations also predict a very similar @xmath50 of the nonphotonic muon to that of the nonphotonic electron .     dependencies for the ratios of charm baryons to mesons at 200 gev .",
    "inset shows @xmath50 of nonphotonic lepton from qcm . ]    within the co / re hadronization mechanism , we discuss the @xmath50 ordering with strangeness content for charm hadrons in heavy ion collisions . in fact , the @xmath50(@xmath52 ) ordering with strangeness content for strange hadrons has been observed at rhic @xcite , which is a natural result in the co / re mechanism for the strangeness enhancement in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the effect should also be manifested by the strange charm hadrons such as @xmath50 of @xmath45 in comparison with that of nonstrange charm mesons , @xmath50 of @xmath53 with respect to that of @xmath54 and so on .",
    "the @xmath50 ordering with strangeness content for charm hadrons is also a powerful signal for proving the co / re hadronization mechanism for open charm hadrons .",
    "the precise measurement of it in future experiments can help clarify various hadronization mechanisms .",
    "as discussed in the last subsection , the co / re mechanism results in the charm baryon enhancement which can further affect the charm hadron ratios in relativistic @xmath19 reactions . in this subsection ,",
    "the effects on charm hadron ratios and the three key ratios are quantitatively studied within the qcm .",
    "the rapidity densities of single - charm hadrons and their ratios in au+au collisions at 200 gev are listed in table [ tab : densityratios ] .",
    "we can see that the rapidity densities for charm hadrons are different from those for charm antihadrons because of the net @xmath55 quarks in qgp .",
    "the yield of @xmath42 obtained at midrapidity @xmath56 is in agreement with the star data from the @xmath33+au reactions @xcite assuming a binary scaling of @xmath9 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , phenix modified the pythia default charm hadron ratios , and they obtain @xmath57 by using @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "obviously , @xmath61 from the phenix ratios is @xmath62 .",
    "these ratios are apparently different from those in @xmath19 collisions listed in table [ tab : densityratios ] . especially , the ratio @xmath63 is much enhanced in co / re mechanism in @xmath19 reactions , as can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ cap : charmb - m_pt ] .",
    "it is also impressive that the ratio @xmath61 is almost equal to 1 , which is much higher than that ( 0.56 ) used by phenix .",
    "the first reason is that @xmath23 is taken as 0.48 , much larger than that in @xmath38 reactions .",
    "the second reason is that @xmath64 totally decays to @xmath65 , but only about 32.3@xmath66 of the @xmath67 particles decay to @xmath68 mesons , and the other 67.7@xmath66 decay to @xmath42 mesons .",
    "the last reason is that the default value of @xmath20 is 3 .",
    "however , even if @xmath20 equals 1.5 , the ratio @xmath69 is still higher than 0.56 .    considering the effect from net baryon number",
    ", the value of @xmath13 at midrapidity should be calculated by    @xmath70    these charm hadron ratios in au+au collisions give a lower @xmath71 than that used by phenix , and it can lead to @xmath72 increase of @xmath7 based on the phenix nonphotonic electron data . here",
    "the errors of @xmath13 are from the branching ratio uncertainties . on the pdglive web - page ,",
    "the newest branching ratio for @xmath73 is @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , from which the updated @xmath76 results in @xmath4 enhancement of @xmath7 ( central value ) .",
    "that is , the ratio @xmath13 used by phenix decreases @xmath7 by @xmath4 and hence enlarges the difference of @xmath7 between star and phenix .    strictly speaking , the ratio obtained by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rec ] ) may be different from the ` real ' @xmath13 ratio , which can be calculated directly in qcm from the @xmath13 definition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : defrec ] ) , i.e. , from the yield of nonphotonic electrons @xmath77 and the number of charm quark pairs @xmath78 at midrapidity .",
    "note that the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rec ] ) is smaller than @xmath78 , and the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rec ] ) can also be different from @xmath77 .",
    "the value from eq .",
    "( [ eq : defrec ] ) becomes @xmath79 , smaller than @xmath80 , and this leads to about a 2@xmath66 enhancement ( systematic error ) of @xmath7 .",
    "based on our calculations , such systematic errors for @xmath13 at the various energies studied in the paper are all smaller than @xmath81 , and the resulting enhancements of @xmath7 are all not more than @xmath82 .",
    ".midrapidity densities of open charm hadrons and their ratios for top central collisions at @xmath83 and 5500 gev . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are from eqs .",

    "note that the net baryon number or the @xmath24 quark number decreases with @xmath22 increasing , so @xmath84 and @xmath85 decrease with @xmath22 , and @xmath63 ( @xmath86 ) decreases ( increases ) as the net baryon number decreases .",
    "the ratios @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 are independent of @xmath22 . based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rec ] ) and ( [ eq : rdc ] ) , the three key ratios @xmath13 , @xmath17 , and @xmath14 are also independent of the net baryon number as the sum of one kind of charm hadron and its antiparticle is conserved , although the yield of the kind of ( anti)hadron varies with @xmath22 .    next we discuss the effect from the charm quark @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "because the yields of charm hadrons are integrals of the hadronic @xmath90 spectra , their yields and ratios in the whole rapidity range should be fixed with the input @xmath9 unchanged .",
    "however , considering that the rapidity distributions of the secondary hadrons from decay may be affected by the quark @xmath0 spectrum , the midrapidity yields or ratios can also be influenced .",
    "to study the effect quantitatively , keeping the input @xmath37 mb and other parameters unchanged , we replace only the charm quark spectrum by @xmath91 , which results in much harder spectra of charm hadrons and nonphotonic leptons . these ratios , including @xmath13 , @xmath17 , and @xmath14 , are all only slightly varied , i.e. , they are not sensitive to the quark spectrum .",
    "the charm hadron ratios are then determined mainly by the co / re mechanism in qcm and some corresponding parameters such as @xmath20 other than the @xmath90 spectra of quarks .",
    "especially , with this property , if we assume the co / re hadronization mechanism is universal in relativistic @xmath19 reactions , we can give the prediction of charm hadron ratios by qcm without the @xmath90 spectra being well determined at lhc energy .",
    "one sees that in the subsection , the ratio @xmath14 varies with @xmath20 and @xmath23 , while @xmath13 and @xmath17 are almost independent of all parameters studied except for a very weak dependence on the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "we further investigate the centrality dependencies of these ratios at 200 gev in au+au collisions .",
    "according to the property of little dependence on the charm quark @xmath0 spectrum , we can simply deal with the charm quark spectra at various centrality bins by neglecting the differences of radial flows .",
    "the numbers of charm quarks at different centrality classes are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ncc ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 does not vary with the centrality based on the experimental observation of the ratios of antiparticle to particle @xcite .",
    "the other parameters , such as @xmath23 , @xmath21 , and @xmath20 are also assumed to be independent of centrality except for the peripheral collisions .",
    "the centrality dependencies of rapidity densities for charm hadrons are given in fig .",
    "[ cap : density - npart ] .",
    "one sees that the binary scaled rapidity densities are all independent of @xmath35 .",
    "this is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ncc ] ) , as in co / re mechanism the multiplicity of the single - charm hadron @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 .",
    "the participant number scaled rapidity densities increase monotonically with @xmath94 as we have @xmath95 based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : ncc ] ) and the approximate relation @xmath96 .",
    "the result is consistent qualitatively with that of the statistical hadronization model @xcite although the input @xmath9 is different .",
    "note that the ratio of midrapidity density for single - charm hadrons at a centrality @xmath97 is irrelevant to the @xmath94 , @xmath35 or @xmath9 , so the ratios of single - charm hadrons and the three key ratios are all independent of the centrality or @xmath9 as long as eq .",
