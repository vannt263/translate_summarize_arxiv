    "the study of unbound or loosely bound exotic nuclei casts a new light on the discovery of nuclear halo structure  @xcite .",
    "the valence nucleons can be readily scattered into single - particle resonant states in the continuum . due to the small binding energy and small or no centrifugal barrier conditions , the valence nucleons tunnel out of the potential barrier to long distances with an extended density tail to form the so - called halos .",
    "therefore , the resonant states in the continuum and the coupling between bound states and the continuum near the threshold play an important role in the description of halo phenomena  @xcite . in most calculations ,",
    "the continuum is replaced by a set of positive energy states without the contribution of the widths , determined by solving the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) or relativistic - hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) equations in coordinate space and with box boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the quasipaticle resonant states in the continuum , such as the widths , are taken into account for the neutron case by the resonant bardeen - cooper - schrieffer approach based on the relativistic mean field theory ( rmf - rbcs )  @xcite .",
    "neutron halos have been prominently observed in experiment  @xcite and investigated for neutron rich nuclei theoretically  @xcite , while those for proton halos are still few because of the coulomb barrier  @xcite , especially for the two - proton halo  @xcite .",

    "recently , the reaction cross sections for @xmath0ne are measured by transmission method and the corresponding density distribution is deduced from a modified glauber - type calculation  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the properties of the single proton resonant states , which are extracted from the analytical continuation of the coupling constant ( accc ) approach within the framework of the rmf theory . a theoretical description of two - proton halo candidate @xmath0ne",
