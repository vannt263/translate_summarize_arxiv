    "more than 50 years ago john von neumann traced first parallels between architecture of the computer and the brain @xcite . since that time computers became an unavoidable element of the modern society forming a computer network connected by the world wide web ( www ) .",
    "the www demonstrates a continuous growth approaching to @xmath2 web pages spread all over the world ( see e.g. http://www.worldwidewebsize.com/ ) .",
    "this number starts to become even larger than @xmath3 neurons in the brain .",
    "each neuron can be viewed as an independent processing unit connected with about @xmath4 other neurons by synaptic links ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "about 20% of these links are unidirectional @xcite and hence the brain can be viewed as a directed network of neuron links . at present , more and more experimental information about neurons and their links becomes available and the investigation of properties of neuronal networks attracts an active interest of many groups ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the www is also a directed network where a site @xmath5 points to a site @xmath6 but no necessary vice versa .",
    "the classification of web sites and information retrieval from such an enormous data base as the www becomes a formidable challenge of modern society where the search engines like google are used by internet users in everyday life . an efficient way to classify and extract the information from www",
    "is based on the pagerank algorithm ( pra ) , proposed by brin and page in 1998 @xcite , which forms the basis of the google search engine .",
    "the pra is based on the construction of the google matrix which can be written as ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) : @xmath7 here the matrix @xmath8 is constructed from the adjacency matrix @xmath9 of directed network links between @xmath10 nodes so that @xmath11 and the elements of columns with only zero elements are replaced by @xmath12 .",
    "the second term in r.h.s . of ( [ eq1 ] ) describes a finite probability @xmath13 for www surfer to jump at random to any node so that the matrix elements @xmath14 .",
    "this term with the google damping factor @xmath1 stabilizes the convergence of pra introducing a gap between the maximal eigenvalue @xmath15 and other eigenvalues @xmath16 . as a result",
    "the first eigenvalue has @xmath17 and the second one has @xmath18 .",
    "usually the google search uses the value @xmath19 @xcite . by the construction @xmath20 so that the asymmetric matrix @xmath0 belongs to the class of perron - frobenium operators which naturally appear in the ergodic theory @xcite and dynamical systems with hamiltonian or dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "the right eigenvector at @xmath15 is the pagerank vector with positive elements @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the classification of nodes in the decreasing order of @xmath21 values is used to classify importance of www nodes as it is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the pagerank can be efficiently obtained by a multiplication of a random vector by @xmath0 which is of low cost since in average there are only about ten nonzero elements in a typical line of @xmath0 of www .",
    "this procedure converges rapidly to the pagerank .",
    "fundamental investigations of the pagerank properties of the www have been performed in the computer science community ( see e.g. @xcite ; involvement of physicists is visible , e.g. @xcite , but less pronounced ) .",
    "it was established that the pagerank is satisfactory characterized by an algebraic decay @xmath23 with @xmath5 being the ordering index and @xmath24 ; the number of nodes with the pagerank @xmath25 scales as @xmath26 with the numerical value of the exponent @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it is known that such type of algebraic dependencies appear in various types of scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "the pagerank classification finds its applications not only for the www but also for the network of article citations in physical review as it is described in @xcite .",
    "this shows that the approach based on the google matrix can be applied to vary different types of networks .    in this work",
    "we construct the google matrix @xmath0 for a model of brain analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the properties of the spectrum and the eigenstates of @xmath0 are described in the next section ii .",
    "the results are discussed in section iii .",
    "= 8.5 cm    -1.0 cm    = 8.5 cm    -0.3 cm    to construct the google matrix of brain we use a directed network of links between @xmath28 neurons @xcite generated from the brain model @xcite . in total there are @xmath29 links in the network .",
    "they form @xmath30 _ outgoing _ links and @xmath31 _ ingoing _ links ( @xmath32 ) , so that there are about 200 outlinks ( or ingoing ) per neuron .",
    "these numbers include multiple links between certain pairs of neurons ; certain neurons have also links to themselves ( there is one neuron linked only to itself ) .",
    "the number of weighted symmetric links is approximately @xmath33% . due to existence of multiple links between the same neurons we constructed two @xmath0 matrices based on unweighted and weighted counting of links . in the first case",
    "all links from neuron @xmath5 to neuron @xmath6 are counted as one link , in the second case the weight of the link is proportional to the number of links from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . in both cases",
    "the sum of elements in one column is normalized to unity .",
    "the distributions of ingoing ( @xmath34 ) and outgoing ( @xmath35 ) links are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the weighted distribution of ingoing links have a pronounced peaked structure corresponding to different regions of brain model considered in @xcite .",
    "we note that the distribution of links is not of free - scale type .",
    "= 4.5 cm = 4.5 cm    -0.2 cm    = 4.5 cm = 4.5 cm    -0.3 cm    the dependence of the pagerank on @xmath1 is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] . for @xmath36 almost all probability @xmath21 is concentrated on one neuron .",
    "this is the only one neuron which is linked only to itself . with the increase of @xmath1 up to @xmath37 the main part of probability",
    "is concentrated mainly on about 10 neurons that approximately corresponds to the number of peaks in the distribution of weighted ingoing links in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( bottom left panel ) . at the same time",
    "the pagerank has a long tail at large @xmath5 where the probability @xmath21 is practically homogeneous .",
    "for @xmath38 the peak of probability at @xmath39 is washed out and the pagerank becomes completely delocalized .",
    "we note that a delocalization of the pagerank with @xmath1 appears in the ulam networks describing dynamical systems with dissipation @xcite . at the same time",
    "the www networks remain stable in respect to variation of @xmath1 as it is discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently , for the studies of procedure call network of the linux kernel @xcite it was proposed to study the properties of the importance - pagerank @xmath40 which is given by the eigenvector at @xmath15 for the google matrix constructed from the inverted links of the original adjacency matrix . it was argued that @xmath40 can give an additional information about certain important nodes .",
    "our results for @xmath40 are shown in panels ( c , d ) of fig .",
    "they show that @xmath40 is practically delocalized and flat for all used values of @xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that all nodes have practically equal importance .",
    "the popularity - importance correlator introduced in @xcite and defined as @xmath41 is rather small ( @xmath42 at @xmath38 and @xmath43 at @xmath19 for unweighted , weighted links respectively ) .",
    "this shows that there are no correlations between @xmath25 and @xmath44 in our neuronal network that is similar to the linux kernel case .",
    "= 4.5 cm = 4.5 cm    -1.2 cm    = 4.5 cm = 4.5 cm    -0.3 cm    the spectrum @xmath16 and the right eigenvectors @xmath45 of the google matrix of brain are defined by the equation @xmath46 the spectrum of @xmath47 is complex and is shown in fig .",
    "the color of points is chosen to be proportional to the participation ratio ( par ) defined as @xmath48 .",
    "this quantity determines an effective number of sites populated by an eigenstate @xmath45 , it is often used to characterize localization - delocalization transition in quantum solid - state systems with disorder ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum has eigenvalues with @xmath49 being close to unity so that there is no gap in the spectrum of @xmath47 in the vicinity of @xmath15 ( we remind that the second term in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq1 ] ) transfers",
    "@xmath16 to @xmath50 keeping only one @xmath17 @xcite ) .",
    "this is different from the spectrum of random scale - free networks characterized by a large gap in the spectrum of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "= 7.5 cm    -0.3 cm    compared to the spectra of the university www networks studied in @xcite the spectrum of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is more flat being significantly compressed to the real axis . in this respect",
    "our neuronal network has certain similarity with the spectra of vocabulary networks analyzed in @xcite ( see fig .  1 there ) . at the same time the spectrum of @xmath0 matrix of brain",
    "has visible structures in the eigenvalues distribution in the complex plane of @xmath47 while the vocabulary networks are characterized by structureless spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] has global properties being similar to those of the ulam networks considered in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spectra of unweighted and weighted networks of brain have similar structure .",
    "this supports the view of structural stability of the spectrum of @xmath0 matrix .    it is useful to determine the relaxation rate of eigestates by the relation @xmath51 .",
    "the dependence of density of states @xmath52 on @xmath53 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( the density is normalized to unity so that @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath28 states ) .",
    "the distribution in @xmath53 has a pronounced peak at @xmath55 , the density of states at small @xmath56 is relatively small ( this is also seeing in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the comparison of unweighted and weighted links shows the stability of the density distribution in respect to such modification of links .",
    "= 4.5 cm = 4.5 cm    -0.3 cm    the dependence of the par @xmath57 on @xmath53 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( we note that except of the pagerank @xmath57 is independent of @xmath1 due to the unity rank of matrix @xmath58 , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the pagerank value of @xmath57 at @xmath59 is very large being more than half of the total number of neurons @xmath28 .",
    "it is clear that this corresponds to a delocalized state .",
    "the eigenstates with @xmath60 have relatively small @xmath61 being close to a localized domain while eigenstates with @xmath62 have @xmath63 being delocalized on the main part of the network ; the states with @xmath64 enter in the localized domain .",
    "for @xmath65 the par is close to @xmath66 .",
    "taking as a criterion that the delocalization takes place when @xmath67 we obtain that the pagerank becomes delocalized at @xmath68 ( see data of figs .",
    "[ fig2],[fig6 ] ) .",
    "the global dependence of the par @xmath57 of the pagerank on parameter @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] with a sharp delocalization of @xmath57 for @xmath69 .",
    "of course , the above analysis should be considered as an approximate one since the localization properties should be studied in dependence on the system size @xmath10 while we consider only one size of @xmath10 .",
    "= 4.5 cm = 4.5 cm    -0.3 cm    = 4.5 cm = 4.5 cm    -0.3 cm    finally , following the approach proposed in @xcite , we show in fig .  [ fig7 ] the distribution of pagerank values @xmath25 and @xmath44 for all sites",
    ". such kind of distributions can be rather useful in determining sites which have maximal values of @xmath25 and @xmath44 at the same time .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of the properties of this distribution would require networks with a larger size @xmath10 where statistical fluctuations are smaller .",
    "in this work we studied the properties of the google matrix of a neuronal network of the brain model discussed in @xcite . for this network of @xmath4 neurons we found that the spectrum of the google matrix has a gapless spectrum at @xmath70 demonstrating certain similarities with the spectra of university www networks and vocabulary networks studied in @xcite . at the same time our neuronal network shows signs of delocalization transition of the pagerank at the google damping factor @xmath68 which was absent in the networks studied in @xcite .",
    "a similar transition in @xmath1 was detected in the ulam networks generated by dissipative dynamical maps @xcite .",
    "we attribute the appearance of such delocalization transition to a large number of links per neuron ( 200 ) which is by factor 10 larger than in the www networks ( 20 ) .    of course , our studies have certain limitations since we considered only a fixed size neuronal network and since this network is taken from a model system of brain analysed in @xcite .",
    "another weak point is that we do not consider the dynamical properties of the network which are probably more important for practical applications .",
    "nevertheless , the spectral properties of @xmath0 matrix can be rather useful .",
    "indeed , the gapless spectrum of @xmath47 shows that long living excitations can exist in our neuronal network .",
    "such relaxation modes with small rates @xmath53 can be the origin of long living oscillations found in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that the properties of spectra of @xmath0 can help to understand in a better way rapid relaxation processes and those with long relaxation times .",
    "we conjecture that the rapid relaxation modes correspond to relaxation of local groups of neurons while long living modes can represent relaxation of collective modes representing dynamics of human thoughts .",
    "the dynamics of such collective modes can contain significant elements of chaotic dynamics as it was discussed in the frame of the concept of creating chaos in @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the brain effectively implements dynamics described by the evolution equation @xmath71 which without perturbations converges to the steady - state described by the pagerank ( which may be linked with a sleeping phase ) .",
    "external perturbations give excitations of other eigenmodes of @xmath0 discussed here .",
    "the evolution of these excitations will be significantly affected by the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "further development of the google matrix approach to the brain looks to us to be rather promising .",
    "for example , a detection of isolated communities and personalized pagerank , represented by other types of matrix @xmath58 in ( [ eq1 ] ) , is under active investigation in the computer science community ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such type of problems can find their applications for detection of specific quasi - isolated neuronal networks of brain .",
    "the usage of real neuronal networks , similar to those studied in @xcite , in combination with the google matrix approach can allow to discover new properties of processes in the brain .",
    "the development of parallels between the www and neuronal networks will give new progress of the ideas of john von neumann .",
