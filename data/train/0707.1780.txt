    "several entanglement measures for pure states of three - particle systems have been proposed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; as we will discuss in [ sec:3 ] , these measures do not distinguish adequately between fully entangled and separable states .",

    "each set of coefficients @xmath36 define a lu equivalence class ; in [ sec:2 ] and [ sec:4 ] we deal with the problem of dividing the infinite set of lu equivalence classes in big subsets corresponding to the different types of entanglement in our classification .    for three - particle systems ,",

    "they show how much two - qubit entanglement remains when the third qubit is not observed .",
    "as we will show in the next section , for non - pure states there are unexpected results ; for instance , some simply biseparable mixed states have no reduced entanglement when the separable qubit is traced over .",
    "we propose a classification of three - qubit states based in the presence of no entanglement ( full separability ) , bipartite entanglements only ( simple or generalized biseparability ) , or full tripartite entanglement ( true 3-qubit entanglement , full inseparability ) , both for pure and non - pure states , with subtypes based on the number of entangled reduced two - qubit states .",
    "reduced , bipartite and full tripartite entanglements have direct physical meaning and are lu invariants : local operations can not create entanglement , and therefore all the invertible local operations ( unitary ones in particular ) must leave these entanglements invariant .",
    "thus , a state in any of our subtypes can not be transformed by a lu to a state in any other subtype .",
    "this classification is equally valid for pure and non - pure states , although there are several subtypes that exist only for non - pure ones .",
    "the practical implementation of the classification is also more difficult for mixed states , since the detection of tripartite entanglement is not completely solved in this case .",
    "another difference is that for pure states we can relate these subtypes with the coefficients of a gsd , as we will show in [ sec:4 ] , while no similar decomposition exists for non - pure states .",

    "we will show the results for all possible gsd s of pure three - qubit states , obtaining the explicit form of the vectors in each one of our classes , and the quantitative values of their entanglements .",
    "for non - pure states the situation is more complicated .",
    "we do not know of any measure that would identify unambiguously entanglement in general non - pure three - qubit states .",

    "parts of this classification have antecedents in the literature . in @xcite , a classification of pure three - qubit states based only in the number of the entangled reduced states was proposed . but with only this criterion , fully separable states ( type @xmath50 in our classification ) and ghz - like states ( type @xmath81 ) are in the same class ; types @xmath89 ( i=1,2,3 ) and @xmath83 are also in another common class , and so on . this classification leaves out the more important property of the entanglement of three - qubit states : no entanglement , bipartite entanglements only , or full tripartite entanglement . in @xcite , the same authors introduced new classes for non - pure states , taking into account the existence of classical correlations ( separable but non - factorizable states ) ; in this paper we shall restrict ourselves to quantum correlations .    in @xcite a classification of three - qubit entanglement in fully separable , biseparable ( in the sense that we denote as simply biseparable ) or fully inseparable states was given ;",
    "generalized biseparable states were not considered as a class different from fully inseparable ones , and the existence or not of reduced binary entanglements was not considered .",
    "an ideal measure of the full tripartite entanglement of three qubits should have at least the following characteristics : i ) to be zero for any fully separable or biseparable state and non - zero for any fully entangled state , ii ) to be invariant under lu , iii ) to be non increasing under locc , that is , to be an entanglement monotone @xcite .",
    "condition i ) seems self evident , but some proposals for tripartite entanglement measures do not fulfill it , even for pure states , as we will see below ; the proposal that we will make ( tripartite negativity ) satisfies both parts of i ) for pure states .",

    "some particular results were given for non - pure states .",
    "in @xcite a generalization of the bipartite concurrence , called the _ 3-tangle _ , is proposed .",
    "the original @xmath85 states have 3-tangle equal to zero @xcite ; in fact , we found that the 3-tangle is zero for a large number of pure states in subtype @xmath82 ( @xmath85-like ) , although none of their qubits is separable ( the three reduced states @xmath90 for these @xmath85-like states are all of them non - pure ) . therefore , the 3-tangle is not a good measure of full tripartite entanglement even for pure states ; it is a measure of something that has been called _ residual entanglement _ by some authors @xcite ; in @xcite it was used to characterize one of the slocc classes ( called @xmath91 by the authors ) .",
    "yu and song showed @xcite that any good measure @xmath92 of two - particle entanglement could be extended to multiparticle systems , by taking bipartite partitions of them ; they would define the following measure of tripartite entanglement : @xmath93 this is the idea underlying @xcite and @xcite , which generalize concurrence , and @xcite which generalize von neumman s entropy of reduced states .",
    "since the three terms in ( 2 ) verify separately conditions ii ) and iii ) , so does also the tripartite additive measure @xmath94 .",
    "this was used in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to prove that generalizations of concurrence and von neumann s entropy of reduced states verify conditions ii ) and iii ) .",
    "but , with any of these elections , @xmath94 would be non - zero for pure biseparable states of subtype @xmath56 , violating the first part of condition i ) .",
    "the same would also happen if a probability density function were used , as in @xcite .",
    "it is possible to avoid this objection by using the geometric mean instead of the arithmetic one : @xmath95 this idea was proposed , in a more general context , in @xcite .",
    "so , if @xmath96 is the tangle ( the square of the concurrence ) , we have a multiplicative redefinition of the global entanglement @xmath97 ( whose additive version was introduced in @xcite and @xcite ) , and if @xmath96 is von neumann s entropy of reduced states , we have a redefinition of the additive measure @xmath98 that appears in @xcite .",
    "the same argument of the previous paragraph proves that these redefined product versions of @xmath97 and @xmath98 verify conditions ii ) and iii ) .",
    "von neumann s entropy of reduced states is an unambiguous measure of entanglement only for pure states , and the concurrence , although well defined for non - pure states of two qubits , has been extended in a practical way to higher dimensions only for pure states .",
    "therefore , in order to have a measure of tripartite entanglement valid also for non - pure states we will use the negativity .    we will define the tripartite negativity of a state @xmath12 as @xmath99 where the bipartite negativities are defined as in ( 1 ) , + @xmath100 , @xmath101 being the negative eigenvalues of @xmath102 , the partial transpose of @xmath12 with respect to subsystem @xmath103 , @xmath104 , with @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "the bipartite negativities @xmath107 verify conditions ii ) and iii ) @xcite , and so our tripartite negativity @xmath108 verifies them . for pure states ,",
    "our multiplicative tripartite negativity fulfills the three conditions at the beginning of this section .",
    "although the qualitative classification of pure three - qubit states was easily done in [ sec:2 ] , tripartite negativity adds a quantitative appraisal of the full tripartite entanglement of these states .    for non - pure two - party states in dimensions",

    "therefore , @xmath108 violates the second part of i ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath108 could be non - zero for generalized biseparable states , violating also the first part of i ) .",
    "we could fulfill desideratum i ) if we were able to replace negativity for some other measure that will be non - zero for any entangled two - party state in dimension @xmath109 , and also found a way to discriminate unambiguously between generalized biseparable and fully entangled states of three - qubits : these are difficult and still open problems .",
    "the set of three bipartite measures @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 contains more information than the geometric mean @xmath108 .",
    "but even this set can not completely discriminate between fully separable , biseparable and fully entangled general mixed states , and therefore does not improve essentially on the unique tripartite negativity @xmath108 , at least for classification purposes .    from the results in @xcite it can be proved that @xmath113 is a sufficient condition for distillability to a ghz state ( _ ghz - distillability _ ) , a property of central importance in quantum computation @xcite ; therefore , tripartite negativity is useful also for non - pure states , even if it does not solve the separability vs. entanglement problem .",
    "our objective in this section is to divide the infinite set of lu equivalence classes of three - qubit pure states in six big subsets corresponding to the six subtypes of fig.1 .",
    "since a lu equivalence class is defined by a set of gsd coefficients , we exhaustively analyzed the type of entanglement of all possible sets .",
    "the full entanglement of the three - qubit state can be checked by studying its factorizability , as explained in [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the entanglement of the reduced states ( non - pure in general ) will be determined calculating their negativity ( for these mixed two - qubit states , we could have used also the concurrence , but not von neumann s entropy ) .",
    "the results are listed below .    in the following",
    ", we will denote the five coefficients of the gsd decomposition by @xmath114 ; an arbitrary three - qubit pure state can always be transformed to : @xmath115 this decomposition is symmetric in the interchange of the last two qubits , but not in the exchange of any of them with the first .",
    "a more elegant totally symmetric gsd with five coefficients is also possible @xcite , but the algorithm to obtain the coefficients from an arbitrary initial state is much more complicated ; therefore it is not very useful for practical purposes .",
    "although the canonical form ( 5 ) contains five complex coefficients , it depends on only five independent real parameters ; by suitably choosing the relative phases for each qubit and the global phase of the state @xmath116 one can express it in terms of five positive coefficients , related by the normalization condition , and a unique relevant phase , as it was done in @xcite . but starting from several generic vectors , different choices of phases will in general be needed to obtain a simplified form of this kind ; therefore , in order to compare the canonical forms for different initial vectors , we will postpone any phase choices ( and the normalization condition ) until they are convenient ; we will come back to this below when discussing ghz states .",
    "now we will show the canonical forms for our six entanglement subtypes :    * type @xmath50 : the conditions for fully separability are listed for instance in @xcite , in terms of the eight coefficients of the hilbert space .",

    "+ in particular , if the three coefficients in @xmath171 are equal in modulus we will denote the state by @xmath172 and refer to it as a @xmath85 state ; the original symmetric @xmath85 state @xcite , @xmath173 has a gsd of this form .",
    "+ the maximum values of the tripartite entanglement measures in the @xmath85-like class , are reached for the @xmath172 states : @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "+ the negativities of the reduced bipartite states of the states @xmath172 ( which are the same as the negativities for the symmetric @xmath177 state ) are @xmath178 .    our classification of pure three - qubit states in terms of full tripartite entanglement and reduced binary entanglements could be used to give a physical interpretation to the abstract gsd classes of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we do not have a canonical form like the gsd of the pure case to simplify the general form of mixed states ; therefore we will restrict ourselves to consider some concrete uniparametric families of non - pure states , to show some of the improvements allowed by the use of tripartite negativity , the problems remaining and relations with previous works .    as a first example we will consider a family of mixed ghz and @xmath85 states : @xmath179 where @xmath177 has been defined in ( 6 ) and @xmath180 .",
    "its tripartite negativity is + @xmath181 + ( @xmath182 ) ,  that is different from zero for any value of the parameter @xmath183 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and has an absolute maximum for pure ghz states and a secondary maximum for pure @xmath85 states ( fig.3 ) .",
    "this excludes full separability or simple biseparability for any state in the family , but can not discriminate between distributed binary entanglement and full tripartite entanglement .",
    "nevertheless this result improves on @xcite , where the 3-tangle for this family was found to be zero for a value of the parameter @xmath183 ( generalized biseparability was not considered as distinct from full entanglement in @xcite ) .",
    "+     states , @xmath184 , as a function of p.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    our second example is a family of mixed states with non - zero tripartite negativity @xmath108 only for some values of a parameter : @xmath185 , where * 1 * is the unity matrix , and @xmath186 . we find that @xmath187 if @xmath188 , and @xmath189 if @xmath190 , reaching a maximum @xmath191 for @xmath192 ( a pure ghz state ) .",
    "dr et al .",
    "@xcite showed that this state is ghz - distillable if @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , for this family of mixed states our tripartite negativity quantifies ghz - distillability ; it starts at @xmath193 and increases with @xmath183 , with an obvious maximum of 1 if the state is a ghz state .",
    "+ finally , we will consider a family of three - qubit states that can be fully entangled or generalized biseparable and nevertheless have zero tripartite negativity . in @xcite , a family of mixed @xmath109 states of the form + @xmath194 + with @xmath195 was considered .",
    "these states have zero negativity for any value of the parameter b , although they were proved to be non - separable .",
    "we do not know of any practical measure of bipartite entanglement that will discriminate these bound entangled states from separable ones .",
    "biconcurrence @xcite , could do this in principle ; unfortunately its determination needs the calculus of the minimum of a certain function for any unitary operator in a hilbert space of dimension 64 , and no efficient way to do this is known @xcite .",
    "we can convert these states in dimension @xmath109 to three - qubit states simply by taking the following basis in the 4 dimensional space:@xmath196 .",
    "the bipartite negativities are then @xmath197 @xmath198 , @xmath199 @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and therefore @xmath202 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the states are not separable into a and bc subsystems .",
    "since the other two negativities are non - zero , we also know that they are not fully separable nor simply biseparable .",
    "thus , this family of states can be fully entangled or generalized biseparable .",
    "we have proposed a classification of three - qubit states based on the existence of bipartite and tripartite entanglements and the diverse possibilities for the reduced binary entanglements , including a graphic representation for pure states that can be extended to non - pure ones , although we have not done it here for reasons of space .",
    "we have considered a measure ( tripartite negativity ) of the full tripartite entanglement avoiding some of the problems of previous proposals ; for pure states this measure quantifies full tripartite entanglement and confirms the distinction between fully entangled states and biseparable or fully separable ones that was obtained in [ sec:2 ] in a qualitative way .",
    "we have given also the explicit form of the pure states in each subtype of our classification , after performing an easily computable gsd to a simplified canonical form ; in the simplest cases we have compared their tripartite negativity with other multiplicative generalizations of bipartite entanglement measures , concluding that they induce the same ordering of full tripartite entanglement .",
    "we have analyzed some non - pure states that have non - zero tripartite negativity ( a sufficient condition for ghz - distillability ) or that have zero tripartite negativity although they are known to be entangled , to show the problems that remain in the practical classification of mixed three - qubit states .",
