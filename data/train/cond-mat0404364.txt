    "with the state - of - the - art experimental techniques it is possible to control the quantum state of charge carriers in a quantum dot ( qd ) .",
    "many effects known from quantum optics of natural atoms have been demonstrated in these man - made systems : controlled coherent dynamics in these structures has been induced @xcite , rabi oscillations have been observed @xcite ) and entanglement between states of interacting dots @xcite has been demonstrated .",
    "however , unlike their natural counterparts , the artificial atoms are solid - state structures , embedded in the surrounding macroscopic crystal . therefore , even in top - quality samples , some perturbing interaction effects are inevitable . the mutual influence of lattice deformation ( phonons ) and charge distributions is one of these inherent effects .",
    "there are three major mechanisms of carrier - phonon interaction @xcite : ( 1 ) coulomb interaction with the lattice polarization induced by the relative shift of the positive and negative sub - lattices of the polar compound , described upon quantization by longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons ; ( 2 ) deformation potential coupling describing the band shifts due to lattice deformation , i.e. mainly longitudinal acoustical ( la ) phonons ; ( 3 ) coulomb interaction with piezoelectric field generated by crystal deformation ( la and transversal acoustical , ta , phonons ) .",
    "the lattermost effect is weak for globally charge - neutral excitations ( e.g. excitons ) in some systems , like inas / gaas , but may be of more importance for uncompensated charge distributions ( e.g. excess electrons ) or for the properties e.g. of gan dots @xcite , where charges are separated by large built - in fields .",
    "the coupling to the lattice degrees of freedom manifests itself in many ways in the spectroscopic properties of qds .",
    "resonant interaction with lo phonons leads to the extremely pronounced spectrum reconstruction ( formation of resonant polarons ) @xcite , acoustic and optical phonons provide a relaxation channel for carriers @xcite with an important role played by phonon anharmonicity @xcite , phonon replicas and phonon - assisted transitions are magnified due to resonant interaction with quantized carrier states @xcite .",
    "the perturbing effect of lattice modes has also been observed experimentally as a fast ( @xmath0 ps ) partial decay of coherent optical polarization induced by an ultra - fast laser pulse @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis both in the linear regime @xcite and in the nonlinear case @xcite shows that this decay should be viewed as a trace of coherent lattice dynamics ( due to lattice inertia ) rather than as an effect of typical noise .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical modeling of carrier - phonon kinetics @xcite and the experimental results @xcite shows that phonon - related effects play the dominant role in the kinetics of a confined system on picosecond timescales .",
    "phonon effects are also likely to play the leading role in the damping of rabi oscillations induced optically in a qd @xcite ( although in the current experiments other effects are also important ) .",
    "due to strong reservoir memory on timescales relevant for these processes , they can not be fully understood within the markovian approximations . in particular , the idea of a `` decoherence time '' , with which the control dynamics competes , is misleading @xcite .",
    "apart from the general scientific interest , a strong motivation for studying the phonon processes taking place in semiconductor nanostructures comes from the recent proposals for defining a quantum bit ( qubit , the basic unit of quantum information ) in terms of orbital ( charge ) degrees of freedom of an exciton confined in a quantum dot @xcite or in terms of spin states controlled via conversion to orbital degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental demonstration of a quantum logic gate operation with charge degrees of freedom in a qd @xcite has strengthened this motivation even more .",
    "understanding phonon - induced decoherence processes is essential for practical implementation of these novel ideas and currently seems to be one of the most topical issues in the field .    in order to study the phonon effects for the general coherent - control and quantum information processing schemes , a theoretical method going beyond the perturbative treatment of the external driving",
    "is needed . in this chapter , we present one of such methods , treating the coulomb interactions between the confined carriers and the coupling to the driving field exactly ( non - perturbatively ) , while the phonon coupling is included as a perturbation .",
    "although the range of validity of such a strictly perturbative treatment may be narrower than that of more sophisticated methods ( e.g. the cumulant expansion technique @xcite ) , the advantage of the proposed approach is that it yields closed formulas leading to a clear physical interpretation of the phonon decoherence effects .",
    "the chapter is organized as follows : the next section describes the system under study , introduces its model and discusses the unperturbed evolution under special conditions . in the section [ sec : coupling ]",
    "we describe the various carrier ",
    "phonon coupling mechanisms for single carriers and for excitons .",
    "the general idea of decoherence due to lattice relaxation is introduced in the section [ sec : dress ] .",
    "next , in the section [ sec : method ] we develop the theoretical treatment for analyzing the phonon - related decoherence for an arbitrary system evolution .",
    "this is then applied to the description of phonon damping of rabi oscillations ( section [ sec : rabi ] ) , optimization of control for an excitonic qd qubit ( section [ sec : opty ] ) and fidelity of a spin qubit operated via stirap transition ( section [ sec : stirap ] ) .",
    "the final section concludes the chapter .",

    ", we will assume that this driving field is strong enough and its quantum fluctuations may be neglected , so that the field may be modeled classically .",
    "usually , for a confined system only the lowest part of the discrete spectrum is relevant for reasonable pulse durations and intensities , so it is often convenient to assume that the total wavefunctions of the interacting carrier system are known ( e.g. from numerical diagonalization @xcite ) and to express the hamiltonian in the basis of these eigenstates . thus , unless explicitly stated otherwise , we will denote the crystal vacuum by @xmath3 and the confined exciton states by @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "numerical calculations for the harmonic confinement model @xcite show that the lowest exciton states may be well approximated by products of the electron ground - state harmonic oscillator wavefunction and a hole wavefunction corresponding to one of the low harmonic oscillator levels .",
    "this is due to the large hole effective mass compared to that of the electron .",
    "for the same reason , even if the geometrical confinement is the same for both particles , the coulomb interaction shrinks the hole wavefunction while the electron wavefunction is only slightly modified ( the electron excitation energy is much larger than coulomb energy in a typical self - assembled structure ) .",
    "the separation between the ground state and the lowest dark excited state ( hole excitation ) is usually of several mev , while the closest bright state ( the lowest one with the electron in an excited state ) lies approximately at 70 mev .",
    "also , for the structure of excitonic levels as discussed above , the single - exciton assumption is reasonable under excitation with polarized light .",
    "even though excited single - exciton states may be close to the ground state , they are formed by exciting the hole ( which is much heavier than the electron ) , while the electron remains roughly in its ground single - particle state .",
    "creation of a bi - exciton requires much higher energy , sufficient to promote both carriers to excited states .",
    "the second term in ( [ ham - gener ] ) is @xmath6 and describes the energies of phonons , @xmath7 being the phonon creation and annihilation operators ( branch index will always be included into @xmath8 , unless explicitly written ) .",
    "since only long - wavelength phonons are effectively coupled to carriers confined in a qd ( see discussion in the next section ) we will here always assume linear and isotropic dispersion for acoustic phonons , so that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the speed of sound for the branch @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for la , @xmath13 for ta ) . also , because the dispersion of the lo phonons is weak around the zone center , the lo phonons ( @xmath14 ) will be assumed dispersionless , @xmath15 .",
    "we will neglect any anharmonicity effects and assume the free harmonic evolution of the lattice subsystem in absence of the carrier - phonon coupling .",
    "only the bulk phonon modes will be included .",
    "although a quantum dot implies certain electrostatic and mechanical discontinuity of the system and the role of confined phonons may be discussed @xcite , invoking bulk phonons is usually sufficient for explanation of experimental features , like e.g. polaron resonances @xcite .",
    "the last term , @xmath16 is the exciton - phonon interaction expressed in terms of the discrete confined carrier states @xmath4 . although inter - band phonon terms may appear e.g. as a consequence of strain - dependent inter - band couplings , in the following sections we deal only with intraband phonon effects , so that the interaction hamiltonian conserves the number of quasiparticles of each kind .",
    "the phonon wavevectors are restricted to the first brillouin zone .",
    "however , modulations of the band structure with spatial periods much smaller than the size of the carrier wavefunction can not influence the carrier energy .",
    "in the harmonic oscillator approximation for carrier confinement , this leads to exponential cut - off of carrier - phonon interaction ( explicit formulas are given in the section [ sec : coupling ] below ) at the frequency @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the sound speed , @xmath19 is the carrier confinement size .",
    "thus , the exciton is effectively coupled only to the long - wavelength part of the phonon modes . on the other hand , vanishing of the coupling in the limit of @xmath20",
    "reflects the insensitivity of the system properties to shifting the lattice as a whole . for gapless bosons with linear dispersion ,",
