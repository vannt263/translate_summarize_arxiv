    "qu  car was first described in the astronomical literature by schild ( 1969 ) , after it had been noted as a potentially - interesting emission line object by stephenson , sanduleak & schild ( 1968 ) . according to schild ,",
    "this variable resembled an old nova spectroscopically and exhibited irregular short - term brightness fluctuations not exceeding 0.2 amplitudes in amplitude . over a decade",
    "later gilliland & phillips ( 1982 , herafter gp82 ) presented high time resolution blue spectra of qu  car that they were able to analyse for radial velocity variation .",
    "they determined a period of 10.9 hours from centroid motion in heii  @xmath74686 and h@xmath8 line emission , thereby confirming the binary nature of the system .",
    "they also argued from the absence of detectable secondary star absorption lines and the implied apparent magnitude limit of the secondary star that qu car was at a distance of at least 500  pc ( see also duerbeck 1999 ) .",
    "the designation of qu  car as a nova - like variable in catalogues of cataclysmic variables ( cv ) originates with gp82 .",
    "warner ( 1995 , table 4.1 ) further qualifies this by placing it in the ux  uma sub - class .",
    "the physical model for ux  uma systems is that these are white - dwarf interacting binaries in which the mass transfer rate is high enough ( @xmath9 m@xmath10  yr@xmath1 ) to sustain the accretion disk in an opaque high state .",
    "the blue spectrum of qu  car is quite remarkable in two respects .",
    "first , the contrast of all line features against the continuum is very low .",
    "the highest contrast emission lines peak at under 1.2 times the continuum level . secondly , and uniquely among known cv ,",
    "emission in the carbon / nitrogen blend centred near 4650    is comparable in equivalent width to that of the heii  @xmath74686 emission .",
    "impressed by this unusual property , gp82 deconvolved the 4650    emission and showed that it is dominated by carbon emission .",
    "this was an important finding because it consigned fluorescent excitation via the bowen mechanism to a minor role , and pointed instead toward significant cn abundance enhancement as the explanation for the feature s great relative strength .",
    "( 0,270 ) ( 0,0 )    qu car was observed a number of times at uv wavelengths with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) . in particular ,",
    "a series of observations was obtained with a view to searching for orbital - phase linked variability in the stronger uv resonance lines ( knigge et al 1994 ) , a phenomenon often apparent in high - state cv .",
    "nothing conclusive was found , but it was noted that ov  @xmath71371 absorption was unusually prominent in the spectrum . as a relatively bright source at a visual magnitude of between 11.1 and 11.5 ( see table 4.1 in warner 1995 ) , it was natural to include qu  car in a recent hubble space telescope ( hst ) programme of high time- and spectral - resolution uv spectroscopy aimed at testing a model for the accretion disk winds seen in nova - like variables ( and in qu  car  see knigge et al 1994 ) . with the advantage of both the high spectral resolution and high signal delivered by the e140 m echelle of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on this target , it nevertheless became all too plain that the uv spectrum of qu  car deviates from the nova - like variable norm .",
    "the main peculiarities are the higher than usual ionization signalled by bright heii  @xmath71640 emission and the ( already noted ) strong ov  @xmath71371 absorption , together with the weak mass loss signatures in e.g. nv  @xmath71240 and civ  @xmath71549 .",
    "an in - depth discussion of the hst / stis e140 m data is to be found in hartley , drew & long ( 2002 ) .",
    "the aim of this work on qu  car is to re - open the thus - far sparse discussion on the nature of this binary .",
    "our conclusion will be that its bland classification as a nova - like variable has served to conceal an extraordinary binary : new evidence , derived both from the hst / stis observations and from the first broad - band optical spectrum of qu  car to be obtained in the digital era , suggests instead that this object is unusually luminous ( with a mass transfer rate perhaps as high as @xmath11 m@xmath10 yr@xmath1 ) and that the accreting material is also significantly carbon - enriched .    in section 2",
    ", we present the interstellar line spectrum as it emerges from the co - add of all the hst / stis e140 m data available ( shown as figure 1 ) .",
    "this is used to argue that the distance to qu  car could be @xmath22  kpc or more . in section 3",
    "we estimate the bolometric luminosity both for the near distance of 500  pc and the representative longer one of 2  kpc . then in section 4 we compare and contrast the optical spectrum of qu  car with those of a selection of supersoft sources presented by cowley et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "finally , we begin the task of analysing the optical emission line spectrum for element abundances and find , intriguingly , that carbon is significantly enhanced ( section 5 ) .",
    "we close with a discussion in which we draw attention to the puzzle the apparent abundance peculiarity poses for the stellar content of this short - period binary .",
    "( 0,240 ) ( 0,0 )    as bright cv are usually nearby objects , the interstellar reddening towards them is normally negligible , and interstellar absorption lines in their spectra are weak .",
    "qu  car , however , is known to exhibit a measureable reddening even though , at @xmath12 , only 3 nova - like variables are listed by warner ( 1995 ) as brighter . on the basis of correcting the uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the 2200     broad interstellar extinction feature , verbunt ( 1987 ) determined @xmath13 for this object .",
    "this makes qu car one of only 11 out of verbunt s sample of 51 cv ( observed with iue ) to be reddened by this amount or more .",
    "we have re - examined iue archive data and can confirm this reddening estimate , noting that the quoted error bound is conservative ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the hst / stis ( 1160 - 1700  ) data now available to us provide the means to obtain an independent , if indirect , check on the reddening .",
    "we can measure the neutral hydrogen column density by comparing the shape of the observed ly@xmath15 damping wings with theoretical predictions . for this object , with its relatively high degree of ionization ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the ly@xmath15 damping wings are interstellar in origin .",
    "the extraction of the data we used for this purpose was one that included corrections for echelle inter - order scattered light , so that the flux minimum in the ly@xmath15 profiles is zero as it should be .",
    "the results of our comparison are shown as figure 2 .",
    "we conclude from this that the neutral hydrogen column density is @xmath16 @xmath17 . for a standard gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath18 mag@xmath1 @xmath17 ( bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) , this column converts to @xmath19  in agreement with the pre - existing uv sed - based reddening determination .",
    "it seems @xmath20 towards qu  car can be regarded as a good working estimate .",
    "the higher than typical reddening for a cv is accompanied by a richer than usual interstellar line spectrum .",
    "indeed we have been able to identify and obtain measurements of 34 transitions in the sum of the hst / stis echelle observations ( figure 1 , see also hartley et al 2002 ) .",
    "the results of these measurements are presented as table 1 . for every line , an equivalent width is reported . in most cases we are also able to provide meaningful velocity measurements .",
    "the clearly saturated absorption lines are listed in the top part of the table .",
    "the velocities given ( to the nearest ) for all but two of these are intended to convey an impression of the range over which absorption occurs .",
    "specifically they are the ` full width at half - flux ' points  the velocities where the observed flux is half that in the adjacent continuum .",
    "it is very noticeable that the absorption in these strong lines is displaced towards negative lsr velocities , suggesting the blending within them of more than one velocity component .",
    "( 0,270 ) ( 0,0 )    [ cols=\"<,>,^,>,^,>,^ \" , ]     the impression to be gained from the comparison in table 4 is that the balmer decrement is a little flatter than case b expectations , whilst the he  ii ratios fit in quite well with them .",
    "these data indicate that we can expect a fair estimate of @xmath21 from a recombination analysis of the c  iv  @xmath45801,5812 and he  ii  @xmath75411 lines , but the same approach using e.g. he  ii @xmath74686 and h@xmath8 may over - estimate @xmath22 .    if the c  iv  @xmath45801,5812 and he  ii  @xmath75411 emission lines form by recombination of respectively c@xmath5 and he@xmath6 , the ratio of their fluxes is related to the recombining ion number densities as follows : @xmath23 the origins of this expression and also the effective recombination co - efficients @xmath24 we use here",
    "may be found in the work of kingsburgh et al ( 1995 , table 14 and preceding text ) . the co - efficients they give are for an electron density , @xmath25 @xmath26 and temperature @xmath27  k. if , as seems plausible , the observed line emission in qu  car s spectrum arises in a disk chromosphere , these happen to be quite appropriate conditions .",
    "for the 5411  and 5801,12    lines the respective recombination co - efficients are @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30  s@xmath1 . using these and further relevant data from table 4",
    ", we obtain from equation ( 1 ) : @xmath31    the error in the above expression is derived solely from the equivalent width uncertainties ( table 4 ) . because the recombination lines compared are close together in wavelength , the impact of the adopted sed on the derived relative abundance is negligible .",
    "potentially greater sources of error arise from the adopted ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) that goes with the use of the kingsburgh et al ( 1995 ) effective recombination co - efficients , and from the assumed recombination model for the 5801,5812  emission .",
    "neither of these is easy to quantify .",
    "we suspect that the choices of density and temperature will not amount to more than a factor of @xmath22 uncertainty  after all to a recombined electron in high principal quantum number states , the c@xmath34 and he@xmath35 ions do not seem very different ( the fact lying behind the near - coincidences in wavelength between so many highly - excited civ and heii lines ) .",
    "the bigger systematic error may be more to do with the implied model for the level populations involved in the civ  @xmath45801,12 doublet transition itself .",
    "the upper level of the transition , 1s@xmath363p ( @xmath36p@xmath37 ) can be directly excited from the ground state via the resonant transition at 312  as well as populated by recombination .",
    "this fact also means that there may be non - negligible opacity in the 5801,12    doublet when the 312    resonance is very opaque  possibly explaining the hint of blueshifted absorption in the observed profile .",
    "these considerations show that it is not obvious whether the emission in this c  iv transition is raised above or below the pure recombination value .",
    "indeed the experience of kingsburgh et al ( 1995 ) with this line for wo - star abundance determinations is that such complications can cause both over- and under - estimation by a factor of a few .",
    "for the present , we can check for consistency between the emission in 5801,12    line and that in other c  iv lines in the observed wavelength range .",
    "c  iv  @xmath74658 is undoubtedly present in qu  car s spectrum , but of course it is blended into the @xmath24650    emission feature along with c  iii and some n  iii .",
    "the effective recombination co - efficent for this line is 8.32@xmath3810@xmath39 @xmath30  s@xmath1  more than half that for c  iv  @xmath45801,12 ( table 4 ) . from a multiple gaussian fit to the 4650    blend , that imposes the correct relative wavelengths of the contributing niii , ciii and civ multiplet components and the relative emission strengths ( within each multiplet ) expected for optically - thin gas , we find that the civ  @xmath74658 multiplet could contribute as much as a third of the observed flux in the blend ( i.e. an equivalent width of up to @xmath20.9   ) . based on the observed equivalent width of the 5801,12     doublet , we would have predicted half this much !",
    "so one might take from this that the @xmath21 ratio is underestimated using the 5801,12    doublet .",
    "but to counterbalance this , there is not a detection of the weak civ  @xmath75470 line",
    "when perhaps there should have been , just  this could imply an error of a factor of 2 or more in the opposite sense .",
    "accordingly we recognise that the derived @xmath21 may be wrong by a factor of 2 to 4 . at the same time",
    ", it is possible that the he  ii line emission forms in a larger volume than the c  iv line emission , with the implication the ratio given as expression ( 2 ) could be a lower bound on the c / he abundance ratio . for the moment ,",
    "our conservative estimate is that c / he is _ at least _ @xmath20.015 . as a comparison",
    ", we note that the solar value for this ratio is 0.004 ( sofia & meyer 2001 , for 10% he by number relative to h ) .",
    "the reason why carbon line emission from a range of ion stages is so plentiful in the uv / optical spectrum of qu  car is now evident ( see e.g. figure 9 in hartley et al 2002 , and gp82 ) .",
    "over a wide range of temperatures and densities the ratio between case b effective recombination co - efficients for the he  ii  @xmath74686 and h@xmath8 lines is within 10 percent of 9 .",
    "note that this means that a normal helium abundance of 1/10 by number relative to hydrogen converts to rough equality in the equivalent widths of he  ii  @xmath74686 and h@xmath8 emission ( if he@xmath6 and h@xmath35 are the dominant ion stages ) . table 4 ( and figure 5 ) shows that in our optical spectrum the he  ii  @xmath74686 equivalent width is about 2.5 times higher than that of h@xmath8  implying a helium over - abundance of a similar order . indeed , for clear nucleosynthetic reasons",
    ", it could be a problem to find evidence of carbon enrichment without some helium enrichment also . if optical depth is implicated in the slight flattening of the balmer decrement relative to recombination case b , or",
    "if case a is the better approximation to apply , this factor of @xmath22.5 would have to be lowered . putting this together with the estimated c",
    "/ he ratio , [ c / h ] in qu  car could be anything between 4 and 40 .    finally , as it will be helpful to form an impression of the c / o ratio we look for a rough measure of the oxygen abundance ( relative to helium ) .",
    "the non - detections of ovi  @xmath75290 and ov  @xmath75590 can be re - expressed ( conservatively ) as equivalent width upper limits of @xmath20.03   . through the versions of equation 1 that relate the number densities of o@xmath40 and o@xmath41 to the he@xmath6 number density , using the 5290 , 5590  and 5411  lines , we can derive the following upper limiting ion ratios : @xmath42 to complete the picture , it is necessary to find an estimate of the o@xmath5 abundance since this may very well be the dominant oxygen ion in the volume where c@xmath5 and he@xmath6 are found . in the merged hst spectrum ( figure 1 )",
    "there is the slightest hint of oiv  @xmath71342 in emission .",
    "estimates of its equivalent width and flux are quoted in table 4 .",
    "measurement of this emission is bound to be an uncertain business both because it is extremely weak and also because the emission may very well be close to cancelling underlying absorption ( i.e. assuming line formation solely by recombination is likely to be an over - simplification ) .",
    "but it is the best we can do for now . using the data in table 4 for the o  iv@xmath71342 and he  ii  @xmath71640 lines , we obtain @xmath43 so , if it is assumed that the detection ( just ) of the 1342  line in emission gives a useful constraint on the o / he number ratio , it follows that the c / o abundance ratio is in the region of 10 .",
    "whilst this is a very uncertain figure , it amounts to a strong indication that this ratio exceeds unity .",
    "in this study , two significant findings have emerged .",
    "first , uv interstellar absorption line data have revealed evidence of a blueshifted diffuse cloud components at an lsr velocity of @xmath44 km s@xmath1 ( to within 2 km  s@xmath1 ) . interpreted in terms of a standard galactic rotation model ,",
    "this tells us that the minimum distance to qu  car is about 1.8  kpc , rather than @xmath20.5  kpc as estimated by gp82 .",
    "nevertheless the fact that the hi interstellar column towards qu car is about a third the total for the galaxy along the same siteline , reassures that it is located in the galaxy .",
    "in fact , if the distance to qu  car actually is @xmath45  kpc , it would be at much the same distance from the sun as the carina spiral arm at the same galactic longitude ( grabelsky et al 1987 ) .",
    "second , a newly - obtained intermediate dispersion optical spectrum of qu  car has been found to contain no o  vi line emission and , yet , unusually strong c  iv  @xmath45801,12 emission is present . it has long been known that the @xmath24650    emission feature is also very strong and appears to be dominated by carbon , rather than nitrogen , line emission ( gp82 ) .",
    "starting from the strength of the c  iv  @xmath45801,12 emission compared to he  ii  @xmath75411 emission , we have shown that there is very likely significant enrichment of carbon in qu  car s emission line region ( with [ c / h ] in the range 4 to 40 ) .",
    "furthermore , the near absence of any oxygen line emission from the uv and optical spectrum suggests the c / o abundance ratio exceeds unity .",
    "we now consider the implications for the status of qu  car if its distance from the sun is @xmath22  kpc or more .",
    "it was shown in section 3 that this demands a high luminosity , @xmath46 ergs s@xmath1 , and hence a high mass accretion rate , @xmath47 m@xmath10 yr@xmath1 ( assuming a white dwarf accretor ) .    another way of visualising this is to scale qu  car with respect to the most famous and brightest of dwarf novae , ss  cyg .",
    "this is a useful comparison also because ss  cyg is a low - inclination binary , just as we believe qu  car to be ( see hartley et al 2002 ) .",
    "parallax observations have recently led to an upward revision of the distance to ss  cyg placing it at a distance of 166  pc ( harrison et al 1999 ) .",
    "schreiber & gnsicke ( 2002 ) have re - evaluated the outburst mass accretion rate , using the revised distance : at @xmath48 , they associate with it the distinctly high mass transfer rate of @xmath49 m@xmath10  yr@xmath1 ( for the widely accepted white dwarf mass of 1.19  m@xmath10 ) . after correcting for reddening , the apparent magnitudes of qu  car and ss  cyg imply that the former is 12 times fainter than the latter .",
    "this means qu  car is intrinsically 2.6 @xmath38 d@xmath36 brighter in the @xmath50 band , where @xmath51 is the distance to qu  car expressed in kpc .",
    "hence at @xmath22  kpc , qu car is 10 times more luminous than ss  cyg in the @xmath50 band , and possibly powered by a mass transfer rate as high as @xmath52 m@xmath10  yr@xmath1 ( scaling from schreiber & gnsicke s calculation ) .",
    "the clear empirical restraint on relabeling qu  car as a supersoft source is that there is only an upper limit on the soft x - ray flux ( verbunt et al 1997 ) .",
    "a low x - ray luminosity is also consistent with the absence of o  vi recombination lines in the spectra we have obtained .",
    "nevertheless , given that ` x - ray off ' states have been recorded for supersoft sources ( e.g. rx  j0513.9@xmath06951 , reinsch et al 1996 ; cal  83 , greiner & distefano 2002 ) , this difference might diminish . a wavelength domain",
    "in which qu  car bears some resemblance to known supersofts is in the ultraviolet .",
    "gnsicke et al ( 1998 ) have described the uv spectra of rx  j0513.9@xmath06951 and cal 83 , and point out the presence of n  v  @xmath71240 , o  v  @xmath71371 and he  ii  @xmath71640 emission in both objects .",
    "these are also prominent in qu  car , with the difference that the n  v and o  v features are in absorption  this might also signal less extreme ionization than in the supersoft sources .",
    "it is unlikely that orbital inclination is implicated here given that all three objects are believed to be at low inclination ( hartley et al 2002 ; cowley et al 1998 ) .",
    "finally we note that for a distance of 2  kpc the absolute magnitude , @xmath53 , of qu  car is fainter than that of these same two supersofts by 1.6 and 0.9 mags .",
    "it remains possible that the interstellar line data mislead in indicating the longer siteline to qu  car , leaving the earlier - proposed minimum distance of 0.5  kpc intact . at this nearer limiting distance , qu  car is still the most luminous nova - like variable known . indeed using the scaling to ss  cyg again , at @xmath54  kpc , the mass transfer rate",
    "would be expected to be in the region of @xmath55 m@xmath10  yr@xmath1 ( see also table 2 , section 3 ) .    hitherto , on the rare occasions that deviations from cosmic abundances in cv have been measured and documented , they have been in the sense of enhancements due to cno - cycle burning ( i.e. mainly nitrogen enhancement , resulting from conversion of carbon and perhaps oxygen : see long 2000 , marsh et al 1995 ) .",
    "qu  car appears to be the first recognised instance of enhancement due to helium burning",
    ". this would not be remarkable if the line emission concerned could be associated with the accreting white dwarf .",
    "we are reluctant to propose this since the character of qu  car s uv emission line spectrum points toward an accretion disk origin ( hartley et al 2002 ) .",
    "the carbon enhancement has then to be located in the envelope of the companion star .",
    "could the companion star be a co white dwarf ?",
    "there can be two objections to this : ( i ) the published orbital period of 10.9 hours ( gp82 ) is too long , ( ii ) a double - degenerate cv would not be expected to be so bright ( even for the shorter minimum distance of 500  pc ) . to counter the first objection",
    "it can be proposed that the time series sampling of gp82 was too coarse to pick up the short ( @xmath2  1000 sec ) periods expected for double - degenerate systems .",
    "certainly , a re - examination of qu  car s binary parameters is warranted , given the extraordinary character of this binary and the ragged character of the phase - folded radial velocity curve ( see gp82 ) .",
    "the second objection currently has a simple empirical basis in that the absolute magnitude of the brightest of the known am cvn systems ( am  cvn itself ) is thought to be @xmath56 ( warner 1995 ; see also nasser , solheim & semionoff 1991 ) .",
    "a third problem for this scenario is the undeniable presence of hydrogen line emission and absorption in qu  car s optical spectrum .    accepting , for the moment , that the orbital period really is 10.9  hours as determined by gp82",
    ", the implication from the period - mean density relation ( e.g. eggleton 1983 ) is that the companion star should have the mean density of a mid - f main sequence star ( or of a star evolving away from a later - type position on the main sequence ) .",
    "near main sequence stars can not exhibit the pronounced carbon enhancement that has been discovered here . at higher",
    "luminosity , the abundance patterns that have been determined for barium and ch giants will not fit either , given that their carbon enrichment is against a backdrop of overall reduced metallicity , with the result that c / h or c / he is typically still less than in the sun ( see barbuy et al 1992 , vanture 1992 ) .",
    "nevertheless there is one class of not - so - bright giant that does come close to matching the abundance pattern deduced for qu  car  the early - type r stars .",
    "these are carbon stars now known to have absolute magnitudes that place them on the hrd as red clump giants ( @xmath57 , with @xmath58 in the range from 2 to 4 , knapp , pourbaix & jorissen 2001 ) . in the r - star sample of dominy ( 1984 ) ,",
    "carbon enhancements up to @xmath26 times solar are found with little change or a small drop in oxygen abundance . to accommodate such a companion within qu  car , the binary needs to be at or beyond the larger minimum distance discussed here .",
    "specifically , at 2  kpc the absolute visual magnitude of qu  car is -0.4 , to be compared with the same quantity for 5 r stars from wallerstein and knapp ( 1998 ) ranging from -0.25 up to 4.17 .",
    "it would seem that the fainter half of this range is consonant with the non - detection of the companion star in qu  car s optical spectrum .",
    "if further work can substantiate this concept , it could lend support to the growing opinion that the abundance patterns in early - type r stars have to do with outward mixing after the core helium flash ( see discussion in knapp et al 2001 ) .",
    "the alternative idea that the failure to detect binary motion in these carbon - rich stars points to their being coalesced binaries ( see e.g. mcclure 1997 ) sits awkwardly with the fact that qu  car remains apparent as a binary in which the mass transfer is _ away _ from the putative r star .",
    "however work will have to be done to see whether an early - type r star in a high mass transfer rate system is a plausible consequence of binary star evolution . in this context ,",
    "the 10.9  hr orbital period may prove too short for comfort  unless the r star can have already shed much of its envelope .",
    "if the distance to qu  car is closer to @xmath2500  pc , we are unable to suggest a plausible identity for the companion star . a dwarf carbon - star companion probably can be ruled out since the overall abundance pattern in such objects is that of a reduced - metallicity population ii star , like the ch and ba giants ( see wallerstein & knapp 1998 ) .",
    "it is also doubtful that pollution of the companion star by carbon - rich debris from unrecorded nova explosions in the past is a viable explanation  if the white dwarf has accreted from an unexceptional companion star , nucleosynthesis in the nova outburst will most likely yield nitrogen - enhanced ejecta with c / o @xmath59 1 ( see gehrz et al 1998 )",
    ". putting all the arguments together , we conclude that the apparent abundance peculiarity in qu  car has to be seen as favouring the picture in which this binary is distant and luminous .",
    "we end with the remark that in carrying out this piece of work we have come to appreciate the paucity of published cv optical spectra ( particularly outside the blue range ) .",
    "the only comprehensive optical spectroscopic survey of cvs that we have been able to draw on is the work of williams ( 1983 ) . among",
    "the spectra presented there it can be seen that only t  pyx and v  sge bear a family resemblance to qu  car , particularly in terms of the strength of he  ii lines relative to those of h  i. furthermore in the case of v  sge one may , perhaps uniquely , just make out from the plot of its spectrum the c  iv  @xmath45801,5812 blend in emission ",
    "certainly williams did not find this feature often enough to consider quoting measurements of it in tables . referring to the study of herbig et al ( 1965 ) on this well - known and perplexing binary , we find a report of data on the c  iv transition giving an equivalent width 1.3 times that of the nearby heii  @xmath75411 line . in qu",
    "car this ratio is close to 4 ! if v  sge is bizarre , qu  car is also .",
    "objects such as these are testaments to the propensity that nature has to try out all the options  and in binary star evolution there appears to be especially many .",

    "<S> qu  car is listed in cataclysmic variable star catalogues as a nova - like variable . </S>",
    "<S> this little - studied , yet bright interacting binary is re - appraised here in the light of new high - quality ultraviolet ( uv ) interstellar line data obtained with stis on board the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of a component of interstellar absorption at a mean lsr velocity of @xmath014 km s@xmath1 indicates that the distance to qu  car may be @xmath22  kpc or more  a considerable increase on the previous lower - limiting distance of 500  pc . </S>",
    "<S> if so , the bolometric luminosity of qu  car could exceed @xmath3 ergs  s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this would place this binary in the luminosity domain occupied by known compact - binary supersoft x - ray sources . even at a 500  pc </S>",
    "<S> , qu  car appears to be the most luminous nova - like variable known .    </S>",
    "<S> new intermediate dispersion optical spectroscopy of qu  car spanning 38007000    is presented . </S>",
    "<S> these data yield the discovery that civ  @xmath45801,12 is present as an unusually prominent emission line in an otherwise low - contrast line spectrum . using measurements of this and other lines in a recombination line analysis </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the c / he abundance as proxied by the n(c@xmath5)/n(he@xmath6 ) ratio may be as high as 0.06 ( an order of magnitude higher than the solar ratio ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the c / o abundance ratio is estimated to be greater than 1 . </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest that the companion in qu car is a carbon star . </S>",
    "<S> if so , it would be the first example of a carbon star in such a binary . </S>",
    "<S> an early - type r star best matches the required abundance pattern and could escape detection at optical wavelengths provided the distance to qu  car is @xmath22  kpc or more .    </S>",
