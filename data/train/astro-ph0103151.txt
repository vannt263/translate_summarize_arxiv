    "stars form under the gravitational collapse of gas and dust in interstellar molecular clouds . when a newly - formed star interacts with the surrounding material , the cloud s physical conditions are altered .",
    "for instance , early type stars create photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , which are boundary layers between a source of far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation and the predominantly neutral cloud ( jaffe et al .",
    "these boundaries also exist between h  ii regions produced by o stars and the ambient material surrounding them . in photodissociation regions ,",
    "the fuv radiation dominates the heating and chemical processes ( tielens & hollenbach 1985a , 1985b ; hollenbach & tielens 1999 , ht99 ) and controls which atoms and molecules are observed .",
    "the observed relative abundances of atomic and molecular species and the use of chemical models yields the physical conditions in the pdr .",
    "these conditions provide clues to processes that occurred immediately following star formation . in this paper",
    ", we describe results for foreground pdr s in three reflection nebulae based on measurements of absorption at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths occurring at the velocity of the pdr behind the illuminating source seen via emission lines .",
    "while absorption is sometimes seen at other velocities , the main components all have velocities consistent with the molecular cloud . from this fact , we infer an association with the material behind the star .",
    "pdrs in molecular clouds and reflection nebulae have been studied extensively at all wavelengths .",
    "analyses have been based on measurements from x - rays to radio wavelengths .",
    "specific observations on the nebulae studied here are given below .",
    "in an effort to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the conditions that prevail in these regions , one dimensional , time - independent models have been developed ( e.g. , tielens & hollenbach 1985a , 1985b ; van dishoeck & black 1986 ; hollenbach , takahashi & tielens 1991 ; draine & bertoldi 1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "more realistic pdr models with clumpy structure and time dependent effects have been attempted as well ( meixner & tielens 1993 ; hollenbach & natta 1995 ; bertoldi & draine 1996 ) .",
    "hollenbach & tielens ( 1999 ) provide a comprehensive review of observations and modeling efforts for photodissociation regions .",
    "little attention has been given to studying pdrs through atomic and molecular absorption in the visible and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum observed along the line of sight to the central or illuminating star(s ) .",
    "federman et al . ( 1997 - hereafter paper  i ) analyzed visible spectra for the line of sight toward hd  200775 , which illuminates the reflection nebula ngc  7023 . in an effort to expand upon this work",
    ", we obtained high resolution visible spectra toward ngc  2023 and vdb  102 as well as ultraviolet data on atoms and co molecules in the reflection nebulae , ngc  2023 and ngc  7023 .",
    "the ultraviolet data were obtained from the @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 ( @xmath1 ) archive , which was recalibrated with the new spectral image processing system ( newsips ) .",
    "the visible and uv absorption spectra yield information about the chemical composition and the physical conditions present in the foreground pdr .",
    "a more complete picture of pdrs emerges when the physical conditions in front of the star are compared to those inferred from analyses of data obtained at other wavelengths of the main molecular cloud behind the star .",
    "ngc  2023 is a reflection nebula embedded in the l1630 molecular cloud ( jaffe et al .",
    "1990 ) in the constellation of orion .",
    "infrared images of the nebula ( gatley et al . 1987 ; field et al .",
    "1994 , 1998 ) show that it has a 6@xmath5 extent with visible filamentary structures throughout and is approximately centered on the star hd  37903 . in a far - infrared study , harvey ,",
    "thronson , & gatley ( 1980 ) showed that the molecular cloud lies behind hd  37903 , which is located at a distance of 470 pc ( perryman et al .",
    "several herbig - haro objects , which are associated with pre - main sequence stars , are observed in the nebula .",
    "two herbig - haro objects ( hh4 and hh5 ) in the southeastern part of the nebula are illuminated by star c ( malin , ogura & walsh 1987 ) .",
    "star c is thought to be a t tauri star based on spectroscopy and its near infrared excess .",
    "many embedded infrared sources have also been detected ( strom et al . 1975 ) .",
    "wyrowski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detected a ultra - high density clump ( @xmath6 10@xmath7 @xmath8 ) which they propose could be the early stages of a protostar .",
    "thus , ngc  2023 is an active region of star formation ( strom et al .",
    "1975 ; malin et al . 1987 ; lada et al . 1991 ; freyberg & schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "the primary illuminating source for this nebula is hd  37903 , a b1.5 v star with an effective temperature of approximately 22,000 k ( field et al .",
    "the radiation from this star has enough energy at @xmath9 @xmath10 912   to form an h  ii region , 0.015 pc in size , detected by radio continuum emission at the star s position within the nebula ( pankonin & walmsley 1976 , 1978 ; wyrowski et al .",
    "the photons with @xmath9 @xmath11 912   create a photodissociation region between the h  ii region and the rest of the neutral cloud . the proximity of the nebula and its bubble shaped geometry ( gatley et al .",
    "1987 ) make it an ideal target for studying the interaction of the uv radiation from hd  37903 with the molecular material in l1630 .",
    "the reflection nebula and its pdr have been extensively studied via x - ray ( freyberg & schmitt 1995 ) , ultraviolet ( witt , bohlin , & stecher 1984 - hereafter wbs84 ; cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 - hereafter ccm89 ; buss et al .",

    "the central star of vdb  102 is hd  147009 , an a0 v star , with an effective temperature of about 9,500 k ( de geus , de zeeuw & lub 1989 - hereafter gzl89 ) .",
    "this nebula was first catalogued and photometrically studied ( van den bergh 1966 ; racine 1968 ) in the late 1960 s .",
    "the nebula is 160 pc away ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) and is one of 10 reflection nebulae in the sco ob2 association ( van den bergh 1966 ; valle 1987 ; eggen 1998 ) .",

    "radio observations reveal the presence of the parent molecular cloud ( kutner et al .",

    "high - resolution echelle spectra of hd  37903 , hd  147009 and 20  aql were taken with the 2.7  m telescope of the university of texas mcdonald observatory during june 1996 , july 1997 , and january 1998 .",
    "observations of 20  aql were made since it allows for the comparison of our optical data with others and it is located behind a relatively isolated cloud for an additional test of the atomic analysis discussed below .",
    "the  2dcoud \" spectrograph ( tull et al . 1995 ) was used with 2 camera setups and a tektronix charge coupled device ( ccd ) was the detector .",
    "one camera provided high spectral resolution with a resolving power at 4000   of r @xmath12 180,000 ( @xmath13v @xmath12 2 km s@xmath14 ) and covered the wavelength range 3800   to 4400  .",
    "this high resolution mode yielded spectra containing 8 disjoint echelle orders approximately 15   wide , separated by approximately 65  .",
    "this setup provided spectra on the following interstellar species ch@xmath15 ,",
    "ch , cn , ca  ii  k , and ca  i. the second camera setting resulted in moderate spectral resolution with a resolving power at 7000   of r @xmath12 52,000 ( @xmath13v @xmath12 6 km s@xmath14 ) and covered a wavelength range from 3600   to 9700  .",
    "the moderate resolution spectra consisted of 59 orders with an overlap of about 15   at the blue end .",

    "in addition to observing the same species obtained from the high resolution spectra , we also obtained data on ca  ii  h , na  i d@xmath16 , k  i , and c@xmath0 .",
    "the resolution was determined from the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of thorium - argon ( th - ar ) lines .",
