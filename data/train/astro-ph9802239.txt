    "experiments to map the cosmic microwave background radiation have stimulated renewed interest in diffuse galactic emission .",
    "most recently , kogut et al ( 1996 ) , de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and leitch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have reported a new component of galactic microwave emission which is correlated with @xmath3 thermal emission from interstellar dust .",
    "kogut et al . found the emission excess to have @xmath4 , and leitch et al .",
    "found @xmath5 , consistent with the spectrum of free - free emission , but nondetection of h@xmath6 emission in these directions is inconsistent with free - free emission accounting for the microwave excess unless the plasma temperature @xmath7 .",
    "leitch et al .",
    "therefore proposed that the observed emission was free - free emission from shock - heated gas in a supernova remnant .",
    "draine & lazarian ( 1998 , hereafter dl98 ) showed , however , that the observed microwave excess could not be due to free - free emission from hot gas , as this would require an energy injection rate at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than that the energy input due to supernovae .",
    "dl98 showed that the microwave excess could in fact be electric dipole emission from rapidly - rotating dust grains .    to predict the intensity of dipole emission one needs ( 1 ) the numbers of small grains , ( 2 ) their dipole moments , and ( 3 ) their rotational velocities .",
    "the observed intensity of 12 and @xmath8 emission from interstellar clouds allows us to estimate the numbers of very small grains ( leger & puget 1984 ; draine & anderson 1985 ; desert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ) . to estimate the dipole moments , we consider the likely displacements between the charge and mass centroids for grains , plus the intrinsic dipole moment arising from polarized chemical bonds in the grain material",
    "however , the main thrust of the present paper is a comprehensive study of the rotational dynamics of small grains , in order to estimate their rotation rates .",
    "ferrara & dettmar ( 1994 ) showed that small grains rotating with thermal rotation rates could produce detectable radio emission , but they did not address the details of rotational excitation and damping .",
    "rotational excitation of small grains (= large molecules ) has been discussed previously by rouan et al ( 1992 ) , who described the effects of collisions with gas atoms and absorption and emission of radiation . in the present work",
    "we reexamine this problem , and include the important effects of collisions with ions , which were neglected in the study by rouan et al .",
    "we also include the effects of `` plasma drag '' due to interaction of the grain with passing ions , first considered by anderson & watson ( 1993 ) .",
    "we derive rates for rotational damping and excitation due to plasma drag which are somewhat larger than estimated by anderson & watson ( 1993 ) .",
    "we discuss rotational excitation as a function of both grain size and environmental conditions .",
    "electrostatic focussing of ions makes them very effective at delivering angular momentum to the grains ; ion collisions can dominate the rotational excitation of very small grains even in predominantly neutral regions .    for our adopted population of very small grains",
    ", we predict the microwave emissivity of various phases of the interstellar medium , ranging from diffuse gas to molecular clouds .",
    "we expect detectable levels of emission from spinning dust grains in all of these phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after describing the environments which we consider (  [ sec : media ] ) , we discuss the electric dipole moments expected for small dust grains (  [ sec : grain_properties ] ) .",
    "the various rotational damping processes are reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : rotational_damping ] , and the rotational excitation mechanisms in  [ sec : rotational_excitation ] . using these rates for rotational excitation and damping ,",
    "we calculate the resulting rate of grain rotation in  [ sec : rot_rate ] .",
    "the importance of the impulsive nature of the rotational excitation is discussed in  [ sec : impulsive_j ] , and the effects of centrifugal stresses in  [ sec : centrifugal ] .",
    "the reader interested primarily in the predicted emission may wish to skip   [ sec : media][sec : centrifugal ] and proceed directly to  [ sec : sized ] , where we describe our assumptions concerning the grain size distribution in various environments .",
    "we present the microwave emission spectra expected for grains in both diffuse regions and molecular clouds in  [ sec : emissivity ] .",
    "the detection of this microwave emission from pointed observations of dense clouds is discussed in  [ sec : darkcloud ] .",
    "the principal uncertainties in our estimates are discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] , and our results are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we will consider grains in five different idealized `` phases '' of the interstellar medium : `` cold neutral medium '' ( cnm ) , `` warm neutral medium '' ( wnm ) , `` warm ionized medium '' ( wim ) , `` molecular cloud '' ( mc ) , and `` dark cloud '' ( dc ) . in table",

    ". we will consider grains down to a minimum size @xmath16 , or @xmath17 .",
    "we require the moment of inertia as a function of grain size , so assumptions must be made concerning the grain shape .",

    "the actual geometry of small grains is uncertain .",
    "here we usually take @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( grains with @xmath25 atoms are disklike ) , but we will also consider the possibility that @xmath26 ( grains with @xmath27 atoms are linear ) .",
    "the physics of rotational excitation and damping will be explicitly derived for spherical grains ; when nonspherical grains are considered , we will attempt to use results for spherical grains but with the radius @xmath28 for the sphere replaced by an appropriate length scale for the nonspherical shape . for convex shapes ,",
    "the rates for collisions of neutral grains with atoms depends on the surface area @xmath29 , and we therefore define the `` surface - equivalent '' radius @xmath30 , the radius of a sphere with equal surface area : 4a_s^2s  . [ eq : asdef ] the excitation of rotational kinetic energy by collisions is proportional to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the distance from the surface point to the center - of - mass .",

    "we solve the usual equations to obtain the steady - state charge distribution function @xmath42 for grains of radius @xmath28 : f(z ) = _ e(z+1)f(z+1 )  .",

    "the charge distribution for grains of radius @xmath28 has mode @xmath43 , centroid @xmath44 , and variance @xmath45 ; these are shown in figure [ fig : zbar_etc ] .",
    "the time scale for changes in the grain charge is of interest .",
    "we define a characteristic charging time by _ z = 1+_z^2_e(z_m)+_i(z_m)+_pe(z_m ) [ eq : tauz ] when @xmath46 , @xmath47 is simply the lifetime of charge state @xmath43 ; when @xmath48 , @xmath47 is an estimate for the time required for the grain charge to change by of order the standard deviation @xmath49 of the charge distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : tauz_and_tauj ] shows @xmath47 as a function of grain size @xmath28 for cnm and wnm conditions .",
    "the grain angular momentum @xmath50 is quantized .",

    "we are therefore justified in using classical mechanics to discuss the grain rotation .",

    ", a highly symmetric molecule would have a net dipole moment of zero , but we do not expect such perfect symmetry to be the norm for large interstellar molecules .",
    "the larger molecules should have minimal long - range order , having grown by random arrival of gas atoms or by coagulation with other small molecules .",
    "it might be argued that very small molecules will be predominantly symmetric because only the most robust molecules will survive in the interstellar ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "for example , the highly symmetric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon @xmath63 coronene ( with @xmath64 ) has been considered as a candidate for the very smallest interstellar grains .",
    "we note , however , that under interstellar conditions the carbon skeleton for very small grains is expected not to be fully hydrogenated ( omont 1986 ) .",
    "such radicals are not easily studied in the laboratory , and dipole moments are unavailable .",
    "we can estimate , however , that substitution of oh for one of the h in coronene would produce a molecule with a dipole moment of @xmath65 , or @xmath66 . in table",
    "[ tab : betas ] we give electric dipole moments for selected molecules , as well as the corresponding values of @xmath67 .",
