    "in the study of nuclear matter and quark - gluon plasma in high energy lepton - nucleus , hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions , hard processes such as jet and high transverse momentum hadrons production are useful tools as their initial production rates can be calculated within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "modification of the final jet or hadron spectra known as jet quenching @xcite due to further interaction between the energetic partons and the nuclear or hot medium can be used to probe the properties of medium such as parton correlation or gluon density @xcite . indeed , strong jet quenching has been observed both in high - energy lepton - nucleus @xcite and nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "current phenomenological studies of experimental data on jet quenching to extract properties of the nuclear matter or hot medium rely on pqcd calculations of the parton energy loss or modification of the parton fragmentation functions due to gluon radiation induced by multiple scattering during the parton propagation . among many theoretical studies @xcite ,",
    "twist expansion approach @xcite was applied to medium modification of the fragmentation functions and parton energy loss in both nuclei in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) and hot qcd matter in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "such an approach is based on the generalized factorization framework for multiple parton scattering in nuclear medium first developed by luo , qiu and sterman ( lqs ) @xcite . within this framework",
    ", lqs proved that the leading twist-4 contribution from multiple parton scattering in a large nucleus can be factorized as a convolution of hard parts and two - parton correlation functions .",
    "such parton correlation functions have leading contributions that are proportional to the nuclear size @xmath0 and therefore the twist-4 contributions are enhanced by the nuclear medium as compared to the same contribution in nucleon collisions .",
    "the twist expansion technique has been used to calculate the effect of multiple parton scattering in dijet and photon production in dis off nuclear targets @xcite and drell - yan ( dy ) dilepton spectra in @xmath1 collisions @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "processes involving secondary scattering with a soft gluon ( soft scattering ) are treated in the framework of collinear expansion in a covariant gauge while processes of secondary scattering with a hard gluon ( double hard scattering ) are calculated directly in the light - cone gauge with collinear approximation ( neglecting the transverse momentum of the initial gluons from the nucleus ) . in such separate treatments of soft and double hard scattering , it is difficult to include the interference between the two type of processes .",
    "for large values of the final transverse momentum of the dijets , photons or dy dilepton , one nevertheless can neglect the interference effects since the formation time of the particle production , which dictates the interference , is much smaller than the nuclear size . in the investigation of nuclear modification of parton fragmentation functions and",
    "induced parton energy loss @xcite , it is critical to consider soft gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "since the formation time of soft gluons can be larger or comparable to the nuclear size , one has to include the interference between soft and double hard scattering which is equivalent to the landau - pomeranchuck - migdal ( lpm ) interference @xcite . in this case ,",
    "both soft and double hard processes and their interference terms should be calculated within the general framework of collinear expansion in the same gauge .    in a covariant gauge , the longitudinal component of the gauge field @xmath2",
    "is considered large .",
    "one usually makes a collinear expansion of the hard part of quark and ( longitudinal ) gluon interaction .",
    "these hard parts do not correspond to any physical quark - gluon scattering .",
    "if one expands the hard parts in the transverse momentum of the longitudinal gluon field , the collinear terms are directly related to the hard parts of the vacuum diagram without final gluon interaction .",
    "they only contribute to the gauge link of the initial quark distribution function of the vacuum diagram .",
    "the higher order terms in the collinear expansion will contribute to higher twist cross section involving two - parton correlation functions and derivatives of the corresponding hard parts .",
    "in a light - cone gauge @xmath3 , contributions to the higher twist cross section can be written directly as a convolution of the two - parton correlation function and the hard part of collinear quark and ( transverse or physical ) gluon interaction .",
    "since the two - parton correlation functions can be expressed in a gauge - invariant form , the collinear hard part in the light - cone gauge should be equivalent to the derivatives of the hard part in the covariant gauge and the final higher - twist cross section should be gauge independent .    in this paper , we first provide a general proof of the equivalence of calculations in both light - cone and covariant gauge of the leading twist-4 contributions to multiple parton scattering processes at any order of @xmath4 in dis off a large nucleus .",
    "we then demonstrate the equivalence with explicit calculations of lowest order semi - inclusive dis cross section , nuclear transverse momentum broadening and induced gluon radiation via secondary parton scattering in dis in both light - cone and covariant gauge .",
    "for simplification , we only consider the semi - inclusive differential cross section for the final quark and do not consider quark fragmentation .",
    "the differential cross section for @xmath5 can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 $ ] is the leptonic tensor , @xmath8 $ ] is the longitudinal momentum per target nucleon , @xmath9 $ ] the 4-momentum of the virtual photon , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the 4-momentum of the outgoing quark .    in a large nucleus or hot qcd",
    "matter in heavy - ion collisions , a produced initial parton may experience additional scattering with other partons from the medium .",
    "the additional scattering may further induce additional gluon radiation and cause the parton to lose energy .",
    "such multiple scattering and induced gluon radiation will effectively lead to modification of the parton fragmentation functions in a medium , photon and dilepton production .",
    "these additional contributions from multiple scattering are higher - twist contributions and are always power - suppressed .",
    "they generally involve high - twist matrix elements of parton correlation of the medium . for multiple scattering in cold nuclear matter",

    "therefore , the matrix elements of the non - perturbative part of the hadronic tensor only involve one term ; @xmath30 for unpolarized nuclei .    taking collinear approximation ( neglecting gluons transverse momentum ) , one can carry out all the integrations except @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "however , in soft scattering processes , the momentum fractions @xmath42 and @xmath43 go to zero .",
    "one should then choose a regularization prescription on these light - cone poles corresponding to specific boundary conditions for the gluon field @xcite . in principal ,",
    "all the prescriptions are equivalent for the complete set of diagrams .",
    "alternatively , one can calculate both types of multiple parton scattering and their interferences in the covariant gauge as was outlined by lqs @xcite .      in the covariant gauge ,",
    "both the transverse and plus components of the gluon fields contribute to the same twist operators while the minus component contributes only to higher twist terms .",
