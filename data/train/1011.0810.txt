    "for the highest scientific standards to be upheld , many of us agree that scientific findings and pronouncements need to be supported with facts .",
    "this is especially so for findings that directly impact the health , well - being or freedom of people . for science to be open requires provision of reasonable access to data and metadata , together with clear statements of relevant assumptions , experiments , and inferences .",
    "yet data today are often not available or are provided with inadequate context .",
    "making data from scientific articles widely accessible requires grappling with many problems , from ethical to technological to fiscal . the workshop that prompted this paper attempted to summarize common threads into principles for proceeding toward openness in science . as scientific journals and professional societies",
    "grapple with these issues , attention to relevant statistical issues must be kept in focus . at the same time , the rich opportunities to participate in and contribute to scientific data - sharing pose new challenges to the statistics profession  challenges that are simultaneously being taken up by other computational disciplines .",
    "what are these challenges and opportunities ?",
    "first _ is the challenge _ to act within the profession _ to establish criteria that define one or more levels of data availability for data published by professional statistical journals .    _",
    "second _ is the challenge _ to support scientific communities _ by defining statistical criteria that expand the scope of usefulness of data made available by those communities and their journals .    _",
    "third _ is the challenge _ to provide sound statistical algorithms , modules and software _ directly to the large , cooperatively generated databases being established and interlinked by scientific communities that depend upon sharing rare or costly data .",
    "_ fourth _ is the challenge _ to identify and/or to create special tools _ specific to the new multifaceted research possibilities , and simultaneously _ to identify _ ( new ) _ scientific pitfalls _ arising from multiple use of rare or compiled data .    _",
    "fifth _ is the challenge _ to advance statistical education and use of appropriate statistical methodology _ for important data in new venues and for new audiences .",
    "this is in addition to the traditional statistics courses and science courses at all levels from pre - college through graduate school .",
    "this article began with a workshop where statisticians engaged with science and social science researchers and editors who are grappling with the consequences of making scientific research data publicly available .",
    "the workshop , held february 89 , 2008 , at the offices of the aaas in washington , dc , was the first in what is anticipated to be a series developed under the guidance of the national institute of statistical sciences s ( niss s ) national priorities committee . the format chosen for this workshop was an exploration in dialogue between statistics and the sciences .",
    "this paper reports issues raised and discussed in that workshop , which were deliberately circumscribed to focus on data rather than data processing or archiving , leaving these important issues to another forum .",
    "the science journal editors opened the dialogue with experiences from their disciplines perspectives on the benefits and challenges in making research data available .",
    "advantages and difficulties variedamong the disciplines , each having different implications for statistics .",
    "summaries of several of these are presented here .",
    "_ science _ adopted the following data access policy : `` after publication , all data necessary to understand , assess , and extend the conclusions of the manuscript must be available to any reader of _",
    "science_. '' this policy resulted from discussion of the benefits , the risks and the practicalities of making data publicly available .",
    "when publishing a scholarly paper , journals take on the responsibility of hosting and disseminating the data underlying the conclusions__. science _ _ has had an evolving policy on this score .",
    "data can be housed in the main text of the paper itself , in the supplementary online material , in public repositories , or in rare cases on the author s web site .",
    "ambiguities remain in implementation and enforcement of these policies .",
    "for example , one question to decide is : what are `` data '' ? does the term data include raw data ( x - ray film ) , counts ( from radioactivity - measurement instruments ) , processed data ( sequence data , classified images , behaviors recorded and counted on a video ) , summaries of all data values , or tables and figures prepared for publication ? defining `` data '' is insufficient without an equally careful definition of metadata , that is , the scientific context within which the data can be understood and interpreted .",
    "obstacles to data sharing may be technical , practical and/or legal .",
    "technical issues include discipline - specific conventions , computer code and machine - specific embedded preprocessing software .",
    "practical obstacles include nonuniformity of format , massive size of data sets and lack of public databases .",
    "legal obstacles include privacy laws , multi - author ownership of the data , material transfer agreements and proprietary data sets . as important as any of these is an author s desire to capture ( first ) rewards from his / her data .",
    "( see the recent national academy of science report by cosepup for thorough discussion of these issues . )    the traditional print - based scientific paper is no longer the optimal format for presenting peer - reviewed scientific results .",
    "data sharing has a fairly recent history in economics , and the field is moving gradually toward more extensive sharing .",
    "economics has some unique features that distinguish it from other disciplines .",
    "for example , the majority of data used by economists is publicly available because they are provided to all researchers by the government .",
    "nevertheless , a small but growing number of economists use confidential information from firms or other organizations which have legitimate rights to privacy of information but which often will allow selected researchers to analyze their data .",
    "studies of this kind constitute about 10 percent of submissions to leading economic journals ; and data sharing requires the permission of the owning organization , which is not always forthcoming . however , the main issue in economics for the 90 percent of research that uses publicly available data is not data sharing per se but rather replication of results .",
    "replication requires knowing how the data were manipulated in the process of conducting the analysis .",
    "data may be subsetted , imputed , trimmed ; outliers may be removed ; variables and classifications may be created in the process of conducting the research .",
    "the actual analysis files may comprise a sample , even a random sample , of a much larger database ; in consequence , the keys to replication require not only the sampling algorithm but the specific sample . for reasons that are not always obvious , different researchers often obtain different results when analyzing data from the same master file ; and it is sometimes the case that researchers results are sensitive to the choice of methods used",
    ". other studies may be in actual error .",
    "this focus on replicability and robustness testing has indirectly led to this demand for data - sharing , a relatively recent phenomenon in economics .",
    "the professional peer - reviewed journals in economics have taken a leadership role in its promotion . _",
    "the american economic review _ now requires authors of accepted papers to provide both their data sets and the programs used to manipulate the data for posting on its web site .",
    "this policy has been well received by the profession , and compliance has been 100% , although this is as a percent of articles based on nonproprietary data .",
    "most of the other leading journals in economics have recently followed the lead of _ the american economic review _ and are now similarly requiring that authors of accepted papers provid their data and programs .",
    "progress is slow but steady and the desired `` culture of replication '' and data sharing that would be optimal is still quite a way off .",
    "the whole goal of the sdss , funded by the national science foundation , is to share data with the world .",
    "the `` world '' means elementary school students and teachers , college students and teachers , foremost researchers , foremost astronomers and the general public  that is , anyone seriously interested or casually intrigued by the objects in the sky . for years , astronomers took photos , and astronomers looked at them .",
    "now instruments are digital , yielding petabytes of data ( the equivalent of tens of thousands of cds ) .",
    "the number of visible galaxies has gone from 200,000 to 200,000,000 .",
    "after two years of availability to astronomers for their research , these data become public . at today",
    "s rate , the data doubles every two years so that 50% is available to the public at any time .",
    "techniques ( statistical and otherwise ) built for the `` old days '' can not drink from this fire hose of data . the only feasible way to access this data is ( or could be ) online , making the internet potentially the world s best telescope .",
    "even so , it has data on every part of the sky , in every measured spectral band ( optical , x - ray , radio ) .",
    "it sees as deep as the world s best instruments ; better still , it is optimal when you are awake , and the observing conditions are always great .",
    "sharing data with the public is also an access to learning , whether at age 6 or 60 , whether scientist or nonscientist , whether amateur or superb researcher .",
    "everyone has free choice to look at any star or any galaxy , to ask questions and to form opinions .",
    "users appreciate the trust implied by giving them real data ; they also need public tools that work at their level .",
    "there is a huge audience for `` citizen science '' ; and this is a rare chance to show science in action .",
    "however , the research problem must be authentic , and the tools must yield bona fide interpretations .      while forensic `` evidence '' is hardly a novel concept in criminal law ,",
    "forensic `` science '' is relatively new to criminal cases .",
    "previously , police technicians , not the scientifically or mathematically trained , opined about the significance of forensic evidence . because their opinions were accepted at face value , these technicians long controlled the presentation of forensic evidence in court .    in the late 1980s ,",
    "science moved into criminalcourtrooms with the advent of forensic dna evidence .",
    "there was great scientific debate about the utility of the evidence , lengthy court admissibility hearings and national scholarly attention paid to the benefits and limits of the evidence . while testing modalities have changed since it was first used in a courtroom in 1986 , typical forensic dna analysis is considered by many to be the `` gold standard '' of scientific evidence .",
    "forensic dna is customarily admitted in court with an associated product rule - based `` random match probability estimate , '' or the likelihood that a randomly chosen , unrelated person in a particular population would have a particular dna profile that has also been found in an evidence sample .",
    "forensic dna analysis has advanced to the point where random - match - probability estimates in the 1-in - quintillions are routinely reported , particularly in cases where a suspect is identified by trawling a federal database of over seven million arrestee and convicted offender profiles .",
    "such figures call for a re - appraisal of the assumptions underlying random - match - probability estimates via statistical study of the data contained in this and similar statedatabases . law enforcement s strenuous resistance to any effort to access their databases  whether by scholars interested in scientific study of the wealth of data , or by lawyers seeking to identify the perpetrator of the offense as the source of an unknown crime scene profile  should cease .",
    "federal law enforcement also maintains forensic databases for many other types of physical evidence that are routinely used in criminal prosecutions and are admitted with statements of source attribution without recognition of probabilistic limits .",
    "these other databases too are withheld from the type of scholarly investigation undertaken to ensure the accuracy , reliability and validity in scientific disciplines .",
    "after some high - profile forensic misidentifications and an in - depth scientific review , new emphasis has been placed on the need for research to address the fundamental scientific validity of these identification disciplines . rather than technicians simply opining , without any statistical basis , that forensic evidence matches a particular source to the exclusion of all others , research demonstrating the probabilistic likelihood of such matches is now recommended .",
    "if done correctly , this research should convert forensic `` evidence '' into forensic `` science . ''",
    "recommendations for access to criminal databases and for review of forensic evidence bode well for a new age of scientific engagement with , and improvement of , the criminal justice system .",
    "an observer from outside the earth sciences might view earth science as a single discipline .",
    "a geologist or geochemist or geophysicist recognizes the interdisciplinary distinctions .",
    "data handling in these sub - disciplines has evolved along quite different paths reflecting the types of data involved and the data analysis needs of the different disciplines . in seismology ,",
    "the basic data , seismograms , are quite simple , with minimal associated metadata , and hence are relatively easily archived .",
    "seismic imaging of earth s interior , however , relies on the analysis of tens of thousands of seismograms recorded from widely spaced localities on earth s surface .",
    "the need for analysis of large data sets contributed to the seismology community organizing the incorporated research institutions for seismology ( iris ) whose data management center now archives , and freely serves , a large fraction of the world s seismic data .    in geochemistry ,",
    "the basic data are simple ( e.g. , elemental composition of rock samples ) , but the metadata are complex and include such information as sample name , collection locality , rock type , analytical techniques used , and the precisions and detection limits of the techniques . until the early 1970 s , individual rock analyses were hard won .",
    "the small quantities of data and metadata could be published in paper form in the journals of the discipline . with the advent of automated geochemical instrumentation",
    ", data quantities rapidly expanded beyond what journals were willing to publish , leading to the publication of data `` summaries , '' with the raw data being retained by the author , often inaccessible to other researchers .",
    "electronic online supplements removed this barrier to the publication of large , complex , digital tables , but the way that such data tables are served by the journals of the discipline is little improved over the paper - publishing era .",
    "attempts to place the published data in relational databases were initiated only in the last decade .",
    "one example is the earthchem ( http://www.earthchem.org[www.earthchem.org])database that freely serves geochemical data fornearly 600,000 rock samples .",
    "earthchem accommodates all essential metadata for each rock sample and is applicable for both individual rock data and for the mineral constituents of many rock samples .",
    "dynamic , interactive , web - based user interfaces access these data to supply integrated informationabout an individual rock sample with references .",
    "this has opened new research opportunities forcross - disciplinary analyses of well - studied , well - characterized , individual rocks . with the addition of fairly simple statistical summaries and calculations",
    ", this is also changing the education and next generation of scientists . with standards for metadata , unique sample identification , map interfaces , visualization tools for data selection ( rock sampling ) and integrated tools for data analysis , both students and researchers can explore this multidisciplinary world .",
    "the attraction is easy to explain .",
    "the rapid growth of a community of regular users is proof .",
    "proteomics is an expensive technology , based on mass spectrometer equipment , and dependent on software to create interpretable data from the raw instrument output .",
    "there are at least five reasons for making proteomics data available : ( 1 ) science has been built upon the knowledge and sharing of information .",
    "( 2 )  data users are not necessarily the best analysts nor the best developers of analytic tools . ( 3 ) meta analysis of data can recycle previous data and findings for new tasks .",
    "( 4 ) sharing data allows independent review of the findings . ( 5 ) simple economics . `` information , no matter how expensive to create , can be replicated and shared with little or no cost '' ( jefferson ) .",
    "simply sharing data is not enough .",
    "available data is not necessarily accessible data .",
    "when data are only made available as arbitrarily formatted tables , they carry important limitations . without source data , true peer review and validation",
    "is not possible ; with very little raw material , testing and retesting may be impossible .",
    "the result of the first may be large numbers of publication without validation .",
    "the result of the second may be data hoarding to protect a scientist s own line of research .",
    "a second limitation arises from the automated preprocessing , differences in embedded software of different manufacturers instruments , making objective technique comparisons difficult or unachievable .",
    "accessibility requires infrastructure , community supported standardization , controlled vocabularies and ontologies , minimum reporting requirements , and publicly available online repositories.bioinformatics grew up alongside the internet , and this is reflected in the successful online data sharing mechanisms already in place in the life sciences .",
    "the final goal is cross - domain integration and validation .",
    "how do we make this all happen ?",
    "first are journal guidelines that heavily influence the decisions made by authors . by first requesting and then mandating data submission to established repositories ,",
    "journals provide an important `` stick . ''",
    "gaining editorial board and community consent is not a foregone conclusion .",
    "second , funders support and guidelines contribute both `` sticks and carrots . ''",
    "third , the data repositories must be freely available and reliable .",
    "feedback loops need to be established to ensure the accumulated data flows back to the user community . while there are successes , there are also authors who will choose whenever possible to submit their papers without the burden of providing truly accessible data .    at the conclusion of the editors and experts presentations , one posed two questions :    _ `` but what does statistics have to do with this ? '' _    _ `` and , what does any of this have to do with statistics ? '' _",
    "this article is _ not _ intended to provide the answers , _ nor even _ to identify all the opportunities , although some are referenced .",
    "rather its intent is to stimulate responses from the various members and organizations within the statistical community to respond to the challenges that this complex issue poses for science . at stake",
    "are the ideals of openness and preservation of scientific integrity . at risk",
    "is the representation of faulty reasoning as science , especially where deep technical skill is required to discern the critical , logical or technical flaw",
    ". one role of statistics is to clarify the reasoning and to support the scientific interpretation by meeting the challenges posed by the science editors and researchers at the workshop .",
    "journals in other sciences have struggled and continue to struggle with policies on making publicly available the scientific data on which the articles they publish are based .",
    "the key issues apply equally for statistics journals .    which data are to be made available : original data ( with de - identification of individual subjects ) ?",
    "aggregate data ? at what scale of aggregation ? preprocessed data ? after how much pre - processing?mixed original and synthetic data ? subsamples from original [ massive ] data ?    key issues also include the mechanics of availability : who will maintain the data ?",
    "in what form ? with what metadata ?",
    "for how long ?",
    "at what cost ? paid by whom ?",
    "they also include preservation of scientific integrity of data , security and privacy : how can data be protected from alteration , deletion or other distortion ?",
    "what about mischievous or even malevolent reanalysis ?",
    "what are the ip rights of data providers when their data is reused ?",
    "what about citation permission , caveats , credit ? who has the responsibility to make data available from interdisciplinary research ?",
    "privacy issues take on a new life when data access expands from the primary researchers ( data gatherers ) to the public .",
    "once in a more public domain , abundant auxiliary sources of information might be joined with the original [ de - identified ] data to decipher individual identities of human subjects or of proprietary information .",
    "what guarantees of privacy can be given to study subjects or to individual suppliers of data , especially proprietary or confidential data ?",
    "journals themselves have additional issues : how do review responsibilities change when available data is reused by a new author ?",
    "do reviewers need access to original data prior to acceptance and will reviewers be willing to examine that data ?",
    "what about papers presenting conflicting inferences from a single data set ? who will pay for the data archives",
    "? will authors publish their best work in journals that require data availability ( and the additional work by the authors to prepare the data for archiving ) ?",
    "for example , does an archeologist have to provide data obtained from years of investigation with the first paper published using the data ?    the struggles to arrive at answers to these questions become worthwhile when the data become truly accessible to additional users to answer scientific questions that could or would not be addressed otherwise and also become available to statisticians and others to develop and validate new statistical methodology .",
    "is data availability impossible ? probably , no .",
    "for _ the annals of applied statistics _",
    "( _ aoas _ ) , authors are strongly encouraged to make data used in their papers available .",
    "data sets as well as software and extensive mathematical derivations are reviewed with the paper . when a paper is accepted for publication ,",
    "these supplementary materials are placed in the dedicated _ aoas _ data and software archive at statlib .",
    "numerous statistics journals , such as _ biometrics _ and the _ journal of the american statistical association _ , also encourage authors to make their data available . the extent to which the authors are required to make data available varies . _",
    "biostatistics _ has created the position of editor for reproducibility , in addition to annotating all articles to indicate availability of data and of code .",
    "nothing can capture everything that happened as the data were originally being gathered or generated or even as they were originally being analyzed . but",
    "a secondary user is going to be severely hampered or misled if key information is missing .",
    "the federal agencies and other organizations have long dealt with provision of sufficient information for a responsible secondary user to know what is possible and what is not possible to assume about the process of assembling data in the database .",
    "for example , tranche is a data storage and retrieval resource for the proteomics community that allows various levels of data annotation ( falkner and andrews , @xcite ) .",
    "the researchers responsible for origination of the data can not be held accountable for the objectives or the accomplishments of secondary users of the data .",
    "the original researchers can , however , make responsible secondary data use possible and thereby promote further achievements .",
    "some issues , such as completeness of scientific metadata , have significant consequences for statistical analysis and for design of studies incorporating publicly available data .",
    "important specific issues , for example , time limitations on definitions of terms and differences in the refinement of measurements possible with different generations of measurement equipment , can be highlighted by their impact on the final results obtained through statistical analysis and thence on the conclusions to be drawn .",
    "nonetheless , since these are of primary _ scientific _ concern , both individual scientists and the professional societies for their disciplines are keenly aware of these .",
    "identification of relevant scientific metadata must be the responsibility of the scientists working in the field ; and as an example , in astronomy work to develop a taxonomy is well advanced .",
    "what fewer scientists appreciate is the need for the _ statistical metadata _ ; still fewer claim the expertise to define these .",
    "some scientists may find providing metadata too time consuming without a deeper understanding of the benefits for providing it .",
    "articulating the questions that must be answered to ensure statistical validity of reinterpretation or reuse of scientific data is the responsibility of statisticians :    * does it matter how the data were gathered in the first place ?",
    "* does it matter that the results came from data exploration ( data mining ) rather than an experimental or observational plan ? *",
    "does it matter whether data points were dropped or not or whether those same points should have been dropped ?",
    "* does it matter if or how missing data was imputed ? *",
    "does it matter how measures of variation were computed and/or whether these can be calculated from the data ?    if the first set of questions focuses on the same experimental / analytical questions that researchers consider in their own research , a second set of questions arise when data is borrowed , interpolated or reused , possibly multiple times .",
    "will it matter if all the researchers studying a rare disease use the identical control group once it is available through a common database ? when should data _ not _ be replicated because it can only be redundant and therefore is an irresponsible use of funds ?",
    "does it matter if `` synthetic '' experimental units are created from several available sources and combined with or treated as `` real '' observations ?",
    "does it matter if a new data set created by sampling from several data sets gathered for different purposes is studied instead of a new sample from a single population ?",
    "what are the implications for estimation of variation ? what are the implications for statistical high - dimensional data analysis ?",
    "why is any of this important to the scientific conclusions that will be drawn ?",
    "statisticians have the knowledge to pose the crucial questions that the scientific researchers need to answer , and statisticians have the experience to provide cogent and persuasive illustrations and explanations demonstrating why these are important . articulating these for scientists to consider as they archive data or extract data from archives",
    "is critical for scientists .",
    "they need to understand the extent to which that data can be useful and valid in a new context .",
    "data in the public domain is not usefully available without the capability of accessing , organizing , manipulating and [ re]structuring it for analysis and for analytic software .",
    "ancillary ( statistical ) support could also take the form of recommendations about database structures ( e.g. , relational databases ) that facilitate analysis or even comparative evaluation of statistical software for those analyses .",
    "statisticians have taken on these roles in the past for standard statistical methodology , especially with software performance testing and provision of reference data sets .",
    "the challenge escalates when more computer intensive or more complex statistical analytic tools are considered .",
    "the separate problem of configuration of data to allow facile transfer for sophisticated statistical analysis becomes more important as the data sets become larger , with greater internal complexity .",
    "going beyond excel spreadsheets requires both suitable data configuration and the requisite data extraction tools .",
    "statisticians are well positioned to provide guidance in data structures that are amenable to the use of sophisticated statistical methodology and to the extraction of data for reuse in subsequent research endeavors .",
    "the challenge to statisticians here is both to advise and to develop a knowledge base for useful guidance .",
    "combining data , whether in large amalgamated databases or simply in assembling from several individual investigations , presents specific needs for development of new statistical methodology .",
    "the whole statistical research area of meta - analysis deals with a number of these questions ( hedges and olkin , @xcite ; whitehead , @xcite ) ; and bayesian methodology often applies when previous research results are used as a springboard to subsequent studies .",
    "still , there are new problems for which statistical methods have not yet been devised ; three of the many kinds of problems serve as illustrations .",
    "one class focuses on methodology  and the consequences for statistical analysis  for subsettingand / or for identifying matching cases from multiple resources whether for the purposes of comparison or for creation of an artificial , composite individual .",
    "a second class focuses on synthetic experimental units themselves  that is , pseudo - experimental units that are synthesized by attaching two different experimental units from two separate sources of [ different kinds of ] information and gluing them together into a single unit with complete information . for example , combining geochemistry on one rock sample with physical data on a second rock of the same sort obtained by a different researcher ; or combining consumer expenditure survey information from one participant with savings history from a banking study for a participant matched in terms of ethnicity , age and census tract .",
    "a third class focuses statistical implications of the use and repeated reuse of particular individuals or experimental units , whether a single ocean floor rock of a particular kind or a single family tree or a single control group from a study of a rare medical condition .",
    "this extends to reuse of code , of models , and of open - source models and scientific coding .    recognizing these needs for statistical innovation",
    "is the first challenge , meeting these needs can follow .",
    "meeting the challenge to respond to `` big science '' opportunities requires getting involved at a fundamental level , then doing the _ hard _ work on the _ hard _ problems , creating the _ new theory _ and _ new methodology _ for deep , complex science .",
    "the interconnected multidisciplinary databases offer scientists the opportunity for investigations at a new level of complexity .",
    "this same complexity puts new demands on the analytic process and creates new opportunities for collaboration and the extension of high - dimensional statistical theory and methods to new arenas .    on a still higher scale ,",
    "as the scientific research goals become more complex , more and more often they are also much broader in scope .",
    "one prime resource that statisticians have long brought to the collaboration table is the ability to interpret the scientific context and then to formulate a structured approach to a complex problem successfully , leading to sound inference from the research .",
    "all this _ before data_.",
    "this statistical thinking now has a place on a much larger scale to provide a statistically well - thought structure for a program of research and data collection rather than for a single experiment .",
    "the data are no longer unidimensional , and the research goals are multifaceted .",
    "data sets are multidimensional and may be compiled from many sources . the questions on this larger scale to investigate a physical science or engineering problem can be where in the overall plan to gather / use data , where to employ statistical principles , where to simulate , when and how to verify . in the social sciences it may be a matter of understanding how to combine public and proprietary sources of data , how to link time sequences of events and data , how to define multi - person decision - making ( independent , adversarial , cooperative , informed / uninformed ) . once again , _ before data_. obviously , with data the more familiar work is underway .",
    "these new large shared databases are being used as primary research resources and as teaching tools for undergraduate and graduate _ science courses_. by providing some statistical methodology that is integrated into the database resource , the database creators provide the scientific impetus as well as a prime opportunity for researchers and students alike to explore the richness of [ multidisciplinary ] information and to discover interesting relationships within the databases .",
    "faculty report that use of the western north american volcanic and intrusive rocks navdat database ( walker et al . , @xcite ) in undergraduate geology to analyze students own conjectures has popularized research as a curricular activity and has created an unforeseen enthusiasm among geology students for data analysis with the relatively simple internal statistical methodology .",
    "( it is not at all clear that this taste of statistics has also created a hunger for high - dimensional or other more advanced statistical methods , although the high - dimensional data suggests their great potential . )",
    "the scope of skyserver ( sloan digital sky survey / skyserver , available at http://skyserver.sdss.org ) is even broader with an open invitation to the public to explore and to analyze astronomy data .    at present",
    "these explorations are limited primarily by the sophistication of the readily available ( internal ) statistical software and the researcher s intuition or the student s inquisitiveness .",
    "incorporation of more extensive statistical tools , both for data exploration and for modeling , could educate the science students in the power of sound statistical analytic methods , both simple and advanced .",
    "simultaneously , utilizing these large scientific databases in statistics classes allows _ primary _ investigation of interdisciplinary questions and application ofexploratory , high - dimensional and/or other advanced statistical methods by going beyond textbook data sets .",
    "one challenge to the statistical community is to identify opportunities and mechanisms to incorporate statistical software that is equally as sophisticated as the scientific information in these large resource databases .",
    "a different challenge to the statistical community is to take advantage of these rich scientific data sources and the opportunities they provide for individual investigations in statistics courses .",
    "textbooks focus on end - of - the - chapter problems and on oft - used data sets have served to assist students to mimic research investigations , with prespecified questions and data that is well - adapted to analysis by a specific methodology .",
    "these public sources of complex data open new possibilities to make the statistical investigation of conjectures exciting , even at rather basic levels .",
    "both navdat and skysurvey suggest directions to explore the information from the level of elementary school to post - doctoral research .",
    "the challenge for statistical education will be to do this as well .",
    "still the most stunning statement by scientists and researchers during the workshop was the query : what does statistics have to do with data availability ? and why would statisticians care  apart from the policies of their own professional journals ?    the answer is implicit in these challenges that emerged from this highly multidisciplinary group of very thoughtful individuals as they expressed the difficulties and the successes in making data publicly available and usable in each of their disciplines .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to initiate a discussion of these important issues within the statistical community .",
    "in addition , these issues need to be examined in each scientific discipline and ultimately find their way into the training of scientists .",
    "we thank the following speakers at the workshop for bringing insights to the policies and practices faced by journals in striving for openness in scientific research and research reporting . by framing the issues , both philosophical and practical",
