    "there is no well - defined notion of a trajectory in the phase space and , hence , the lyapunov exponents can not be computed . in quantum mechanics",
    "there is no exponential sensitivity to small variations in initial conditions because the time evolution of an isolated quantum system is unitary , and the overlap of any two different quantum state vectors is a constant in course of time .",
    "moreover , quantum phase space is discrete due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle unlike continuous classical phase space .",
    "namely the continuity of the classical phase space provides a possibility of chaotic mixing which exploits more and more fine structures in the classical phase space in course of time whereas the quantum evolution stops to do that over a rather short ehrenfest time .",

    "nevertheless , a sort of quantum - classical correspondence both in regular and chaotic regimes of the center - of - mass motion has been found .",
    "it should be stressed that this correspondence manifests itself in behavior of the quantum bloch variable @xmath96 in the semiclassical equations of motion ( [ mainsys ] ) .    however , the quantum - classical correspondence is not and could not be absolute because the planck constant is equal to 1 with our normalization .",
