    "among the surprising experimental results in au - au collisions in the first years of operation of the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) were several unexpected features of hadron spectra in the intermediate transverse - momentum regime , @xmath4  gev  @xcite .",
    "most notably , a large baryon - to - meson ratio of around one and the so - called constituent quark - number scaling ( cqns ) of the elliptic flow coefficient , @xmath1 , have been found .",
    "these features are difficult to explain in hydrodynamic models  @xcite which provide an excellent description of hadronic observables in the low-@xmath0 region , @xmath5  gev , but lack sufficient yield at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "quark coalescence models ( qcms ) have been used extensively and successfully to describe the baryon - over - meson enhancement and cqns at intermediate @xmath0  @xcite . the basic mechanism",
    "underlying qcms is the recombination of constituent quarks into hadrons at the putative phase boundary ( gluonic degrees of freedom are either neglected or converted  by hand \" into @xmath6-@xmath7 pairs ) .",
    "the constituent quarks are identified with the _ valence _ quarks inside hadrons , and , consequently , the hadron spectra directly reflect upon the partonic spectra and collective dynamics of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "a major challenge is then to search for ( and possibly construct ) a unified description of hadron production at low and intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , as demonstrated in a recent phenix paper  @xcite , a very general cqns seems to emerge ( in centrality , system size and collision energy ) when the scaling is applied to the _ kinetic energy _ of the produced hadrons .",
    "one of the limitations of conventional qcms is the collinear and instantaneous approximation of the hadron formation process which limits their applicability to intermediate @xmath0 where the inherent violation of energy conservation is expected to be small .",
    "it is also not obvious how to recover an equilibrium limit in this framework which renders the connection to the low @xmath0 ( hydrodynamic ) regime less transparent . in this work ,",
    "we propose an alternative realization of the recombination picture by formulating hadron production in terms of a boltzmann transport equation .",
    "our key dynamical ingredient is hadronic resonance formation via @xmath6-@xmath7  annihilation \" .",
    "their finite width not only enables to go beyond the collinear limit and explicitly conserve 4-momentum , but also introduces , in principle , a sensitivity to spectral properties of the qgp ( e.g. , widths and @xmath2 values in the fusion process ) . in the limit of large times ,",
    "on which we will focus here , we recover an equilibrium formula which reproduces the thermal boltzmann limit and can be compared to qcm results .",
    "we will constrain ourselves to the cases of charm and strange quarks hadronizing within a bulk medium where the input anti-/quark phase distributions are parametrized with collective properties inferred from rhic data .",
    "we will compute both @xmath0 spectra and @xmath1 for @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons , and study their scaling properties in connection with the transition from low to intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "our approach bears some similarity with recent work in ref .",
    "@xcite , which , however , does not address the @xmath11 problem and utilizes different interactions .",
    "our starting point is the boltzmann equation for the meson phase - space distribution , @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote 3-momentum and position of the meson @xmath16 , and @xmath17 its width which in the present work is attributed to 2-body decays into quark and antiquark , @xmath18 , and assumed to be constant .",
    "the factor @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 : meson mass and energy ) , is due to lorentz time dilation ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the surface term on the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) is mostly relevant for high-@xmath0 particles , and vanishes in the infinite volume limit ; since our objective here is not a quantitative description of data we neglect it in the following .",
    "the relation of the gain term , @xmath22 , to the underlying microscopic interaction becomes explicit upon integration over phase space , @xmath23 with @xmath24 the cross section for the process @xmath25 at center - of - mass ( cm ) energy squared @xmath26 , @xmath27 the 4-momenta of quark and antiquark , and @xmath28 their phase space distribution functions , normalized as @xmath29 . throughout this paper",
    ", quarks will be assumed to be zero - width quasi - particles with an effective mass @xmath30 which we treat as a parameter .",
    "the intrinsically classical nature of the boltzmann equation warrants the use of classical distribution functions for all the particles .",
    "in addition , we will assume zero chemical potential for all quark species .",
    "for the cross section we employ a relativistic breit - wigner form , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a statistical weight given in terms of the spin ( -color ) degeneracy , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , of the meson ( anti-/quark ) ; @xmath35 denotes the quark 3-momentum in the cm frame . with @xmath36 being the only channel",
    ", it follows that @xmath37 .",
    "detailed balance requires the same @xmath17 in the loss term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) , thus ensuring a proper equilibrium limit with @xmath38 the pertinent relaxation time .",
    "this formulation conserves 4-momentum and applies to all resonances @xmath16 with masses close to or above the @xmath39 threshold , i.e. , for positive @xmath2 value , @xmath40 if the @xmath41 channel proceeds too far off - shell , i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( e.g. , for pions ) , other processes need to be considered , e.g. , @xmath44 ( which is possible in the present formalism by including the respective cross sections ) .",
    "let us now elaborate the equilibrium limit of our approach , by imposing the stationarity condition , @xmath45 introducing the notation @xmath46 into the gain term @xmath47 , eq .",
    "( [ gain ] ) , we find @xmath48 eq .  ( [ eqboltzappr ] ) represents the large time limit of the boltzmann equation and is the expression which comes closest to the conventional qcm formula . for hadronization times less or comparable to the relaxation time , @xmath49",
    ", the equilibrium limit will not be reached and a short time solution will be appropriate . in that case , the time variable enters explicitly into the final result , reflecting the dynamical nature of the boltzmann equation .",
    "we have verified numerically that for @xmath50 eq .",
    "( [ eqboltzappr ] ) accurately recovers the standard boltzmann distribution for a meson @xmath16 at temperature @xmath51 , _ if _ the constraint of a positive @xmath2 value is satisfied ( for negative @xmath2 the 2@xmath521 channel is inoperative ) .",
    "this shows that equilibration and energy conservation are closely related in our approach , constituting a significant improvement over previous qcms .",
    "to compute meson spectra we have to specify the input @xmath6 and @xmath7 distributions ( including their masses and collective properties ) , as well as the meson - resonance masses and widths . for an exploratory calculation",
    ", we will focus on a qgp fireball close to the expected hadronization temperature , @xmath53  mev ( as in previous qcm studies ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume a constant ( average ) homogeneous cylindrical volume with collective transverse expansion velocity with linear radial profile , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 : surface radius and flow velocity ) , and use the quasi - equilibrium limit , eq .",

    "while the shape of the @xmath0 spectra is affected by @xmath56 , the total multiplicities must be independent of @xmath56 . based on the fireball eigenvolume , @xmath61",
    ", corresponding to a system at rest ( @xmath62 ) , the volume element in the lab frame follows from the corresponding lorentz - contraction factor @xmath63 .",
    "we have verified that this leads to total quark multiplicities independent of @xmath56 .",
    "the eigenvolume is fixed at @xmath64@xmath65 using a hadron resonance gas in chemical equilibrium at @xmath66  mev to reproduce the correct pion rapidity density @xmath67 for 0 - 10% central collisions ( including feed - down )  @xcite . since thermal rapidity distributions for heavy particles",
    "are narrower than for thermal pions , the @xmath68 values for the former have to be renormalized by a rapidity - width ratio , @xmath69 ( @xmath70=1.8 ) , to recover the proper equilibrium ratio for @xmath71 . in this way ,",

    "3 integrations can be performed analytically , leaving a 3-dimensional integral to be computed numerically . with a dependence on the transverse radius of the form @xmath74 , the eigenvolume of the fireball factorizes and enters as an overall factor for @xmath0 spectra .",
    "a more complete description of @xmath0 spectra should account for a hard component , which at rhic energies is expected to become significant at @xmath75  gev .",
    "since we here focus on the conceptual aspects of our approach , we will defer the inclusion of a hard component to a future paper .",
