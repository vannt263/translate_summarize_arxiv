    "let @xmath0 be a connected riemannian (= @xmath1 is positive definite ) or pseudo - riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "we say that a metric @xmath3 on @xmath4 is _ geodesically equivalent _ to @xmath1 , if every geodesic of @xmath1 is a ( reparametrized ) geodesic of @xmath3 .",
    "we say that they are _ affine equivalent _ , if their levi - civita connections coincide .",
    "the first examples of geodesically equivalent metrics are due to lagrange @xcite .",
    "he observed that the radial projection @xmath5 takes geodesics of the half - sphere @xmath6 to the geodesics of the plane @xmath7 , since the geodesics of both metrics are intersection of the 2-plane containing the point @xmath8 with the surface .",
    "later , beltrami @xcite generalized the example for the metrics of constant negative curvature , and for the pseudo - riemannian metrics of constant curvature . in the example of lagrange , he replaced the half sphere by the half of one of the hyperboloids @xmath9 with the restriction of the lorentz metrics @xmath10 to it .",
    "then , the geodesics of the metric are also intersections of the 2-planes containing the point @xmath8 with the surface , and , therefore , the stereographic projection sends it to the straight lines of the appropriate plane .    though the examples of the lagrange and beltrami are two - dimensional , one can easily generalize them for every dimension ( for riemannian metrics , it was done already in @xcite ) and for every signature .",
    "since the time of hermann weyl , geodesically equivalent metrics were actively discussed in the realm of geneal relativity theory .",
    "the context of general relativity poses the following restrictions : the dimension is @xmath11 , the metrics are pseudo - riemannian of lorentz signature @xmath12 or @xmath13 , and sometimes the metrics satisfy additional assumptions such that one or both metrics are ricci - flat ( @xmath14 ) , or einstein ( @xmath15 ) , or , more generally , satisfy the einstein equation @xmath16 with ` physically interesting ' stress - energy tensor @xmath17 .",
    "let us explain ( using a slightly naive language ) one of the possible motivations for this interest .",
    "suppose we would like to understand the structure of the space - time in a certain part of the universe .",
    "we assume that this part is far enough so the we can use only telescopes ( in particular we can not send a space ship there ) .",
    "we still assume that the telescopes can see sufficiently many objects in this part of universe .",
    "then , if the relativistic effects are not negligible ( that happens for example if the objects in this part of space time are sufficiently fast or if this region of the universe is big enough ) , we obtain as a rule the world lines of the objects as unparameterized curves .",
    "indeed , local coordinates on a 4-manifold are 4 smooth functions on the manifold such that their differentials are linearly independent .",
    "now , for every freely falling object in this part of the universe such that it can be registered by telescopes , each telescope at every moment of time gives us two such functions , namely the spherical coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( latitude and longitude ) of the direction the light reflected from the object comes to the telescope from ( in a naive language , the telescope ` sees ' the direction where the object lies ) , see the picture below .",
    "since we have two telescopes , altogether we have 4 functions of @xmath20 ,  @xmath21 , that we consider to be the word line ( i.e. , geodesic ) of the object in the coordinate system @xmath22 .",
    "if we see sufficiently many objects , we have sufficiently many geodesics .",
    "of course , we can not get lightlike or spacelike geodesics by this procedure . in the best case",
    ", we can reconstruct ( numerically ) sufficiently many geodesics , in the sense their velocity vectors are dense in a certain open subset of @xmath23 .",
    "see also the discussion in @xcite .",
    "now , as a rule , we can not get the natural parameter ( = proper time ) of an object .",
    "indeed , if the relativistic effects are are not negligible , the proper time of the object is not our own time @xmath20 , i.e. , the curve @xmath21 is a reparameterized geodesic only . if we can not observe a periodic process on an object ( note that the astronomical objects such that we can register a periodic process on , for example pulsars , are very rare ) or any other way to measure the own time of the object , we can not obtain the own time of the objects by astronomic observations ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the general setting is as follows : we have a family of smooth curves @xmath24 in @xmath25 depending on 6-dimensionaldimensional manifold has the structure of a manifold of dimension @xmath26 parameter @xmath27 ; we assume that the family is sufficiently big ( we formalize ` sufficiently big ' in the beginning of section [ problem11 ] ) .",
    "we need to find a metric @xmath1 such that for every fixed @xmath28 the curve @xmath24 is a reparameterized geodesic of @xmath1 .",
    "mathematically , the problem has sense in every dimension and for every signature of the metric . in dimension 2 ,",
    "versions of this question were considered by s. lie @xcite and r. liouville @xcite , and were also discussed by veblen and thomas @xcite and eisenhart @xcite in the beginning of 20th century . in the realm of general relativity ,",
    "the problem was explicitly stated by j. ehlers et al @xcite , where it was said that _ `` we reject clocks as basic tools for setting up the space - time geometry and propose ... freely falling particles instead .",
    "we wish to show how the full space - time geometry can be synthesized ... .",
    "not only the measurement of length but also that of time then appears as a derived operation . '' _",
    "both subproblems were actively discussed in the literature . in dimension 2 , the answer on subproblem [ 1.1 ] is classical and was known already to sophus lie ; given a family of curves one constructs an ode of the second order @xmath32 ; the curves @xmath29 are reparameterized geodesics of a certain connection if and only if the right hand side of the ode is a 3rd degree polynomial in @xmath33 , @xmath34 the answer in the multidimensional case can be obtained using the same idea as in dimension @xmath35 , we give it in section [ problem11 ] .",
    "the second subproblem is more complicated and is almost open . in dimension 2 ,",
    "the subproblem was considered in the recent paper @xcite of bryant et al : given an affine connection , they construct a system of differential invariants that vanish if and only if there exists a metric ( in a neighborhood of almost every point ) in the projective class of this connection .",
    "the invariants are very complicated and are of very high orders .    in theory , one can also obtain a similar answer in every dimension .",
    "indeed , by @xcite , in every dimension the existence of a metric in a projective class is equivalent to the existence of a nontrivial solution of a certain overdetermined system of linear pde in the cauchy - frobenius form ( i.e. , the sysem is of first order and all derivatives of unknown functions are explicit ( linear ) expressions in the unknown functions ) .",
    "given an overdetermined system of pde in the cauchy - frobenius form , one can always , in theory , construct a system of differential invariants that vanish if and only if the system admits a nontrivial solution ( in a neighborhood of almost every point ) .",
    "an effective construction of these differential invariants could be very complicates .",
    "the results of @xcite show that it is indeed the case in dimension 2 .",
    "it is hard to predict whether the system of differential invariants is easier in the multidimensional case ( normally multidimensional cases are harder than lowdimensional ; but sometimes overdetermined systems are easier to analyse in higher dimensions , because they can have higher degree of overdetermination ) .    in the present paper , in section [ problem12 ] we give an algorithmic answer to subproblem [ 1.2 ] under the additional assumption that the metric @xmath1 we are looking for is ricci - flat and the projective class satisfies certain nondegeneracy assumption , i.e. , in a situation most interesting from the viewpoint of general relativity . in section [ problem21 ]",
    ", we also discuss the case of arbitrary metric : we show that also in this case one can algorithmically reconstruct the metric by its projective class assuming certain nondegeneracy assumption on the projective class ; though in this case the nondegeneracy assumption is harder to check .",
    "of course it is important in what form the geodesics @xmath29 are given .",
    "below , it will be clear what information we need from @xmath36 in order our algorithm works .",
    "if the geodesics are given numerically ( which is the case if they came from astronomic observations ) , this information could be extracted without difficulties .",
    "the example of lagrange / beltrami above shows that in certain situations the reconstruction is not unique : the geodesics of every metric of constant curvature are straight lines , i.e. , the geodesics of the standard flat metric , in a certain coordinate system .",
    "constant curvature metrics are not the only metrics that allow nontrivial geodesical equivalence .",
    "for example , as it was shown by dini , the following two metrics on @xmath37 are geodesically equivalent @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are arbitrary ( smooth ) functions of the indicated variables such that the formulas correspond to metrics ( i.e. , @xmath41 for all @xmath42 ) .",
    "this example was generalized for all dimensions by levi - civita : from his results it is follows that the following two 4-dimensional metrics are geodesically equivalent :                  let us comment on these subproblems .",
    "the part of the supbproblem [ 2.1 ] that is hard or even impossible to formalize is the word `` interesting '' . instead of formalizing this notion ,",
    "let us give few results in this direction .",
    "( two metrics are _ affinely equivalent _ , if their levi - civita connections coincide .",
    "affine equivalent ricci - flat 4-dimensional metrics are completely understood ) .",
    "it is one of the results petrov obtained in 1972 the lenin prize , the most important scientific award of the soviet union , for .            where r = r(t ) is a real function ( the scale factor ) of the ` cosmic time ' @xmath20 .",
    "the metric is not geodesically rigid . indeed , for every constant @xmath49 such that the formula below has sense",
    ", the metric @xmath50 is geodesically equivalent to @xmath1 ( one can see it directly as it was done for example @xcite or @xcite , see also discussion in @xcite .",
    "actually , the pair of geodesically equivalent metrics ( [ rw1],[rw2 ] ) is a special case of geodesically equivalent metrics from levi - civita @xcite ) .",
    "the metrics listed above , i.e. , einstein metrics and flrw metrics , are without any doubt interesting for general relativity . of cause , there are other metrics that could be interesting for general relativity , and we consider it very important to understand what ` interesting ' metrics are geodesically rigid . in the present paper , in section [ problem21 ] , we prove that _ almost every 4-dimensional metric is geodesically rigid .",
    "_    let us explain what we understand under almost every .",
    "our result is local , so we will work in a small neighborhood @xmath52 with fixed coordinates @xmath53 .",
    "we consider a metric @xmath1 as the mapping @xmath54 ; the space @xmath55 should be viewed as the space of symmetric @xmath56-matrices . on the space of metrics ( viewed as mappings )",
    "we consider the standard uniform @xmath57topology : the metric @xmath1 is @xmath58close to the metric @xmath3 in this topology , if the components of @xmath1 and their first and second derivatives are @xmath58close to that of @xmath3 .",
    "_ for any metric @xmath1 and every @xmath59 there exists a metric @xmath60 such that @xmath60 is @xmath61-close to @xmath1 in the @xmath62sense , and such that @xmath60 is geodesically rigid",
    ". moreover , there exists @xmath63 such that every metric that is @xmath64 close to @xmath60 in the @xmath62sense is also geodesically rigid .",
    "_    the result is also true in dimensions @xmath65 ; the proof is essentially the same .",
    "now , concerning the lower dimensions , the result is true in dimension 3 , if we replace the uniform @xmath62 topology by the uniform @xmath66-topology .",
    "the proof ( will not be given here ) is based on the same idea . in dimension 2 ,",
    "the result is again true , if we replace the uniform @xmath62 topology by the uniform @xmath67-topology .",
    "this result was expected , at least if we replace @xmath62topology by @xmath68-topology .",
    "indeed , by sinjukov @xcite and eastwood et al @xcite , the existence of a metric geodesically equivalent to a given one is equivalent to the existence of a nontrivial solution of a certain linear system of partial differential equations in the cauchy - frobenius form , whose coefficients are certain invariant expressions in the components of the given metrics and their derivatives .",
    "it is known that the existence of the solution of such system is equivalent to certain differential conditions on coefficients , that is , on the entries of the metrics .",
    "if there exists at least one metric that is geodesically rigid , then the differential conditions are not identically fulfilled , and almost every ( in the @xmath69 sense ) metric is geodesically rigid .",
    "now , the existence of geodesically rigid metrics in dimensions @xmath70 is wellknown ( at least since sinjukov @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of geodesically equivalent metrics in dimension @xmath71 is more tricky ; it follows from kruglikov @xcite where all above mentioned differential conditions were constructed .",
    "so in a certain sense our result is the improving @xmath69 closeness ( which should be clear to experts , though we did not find a place where it is written ) to @xmath62closeness .",
    "let us now comment on subproblem [ 2.2 ] .",
    "first of all , the problem is very classical , and was explicitly asked by e. beltrami generalizzazione @xmath72 del nostro problema , vale a dire : riportare i punti di una superficie sopra unaltra superficie in modo che alle linee geodetiche della prima corrispondano linee geodetiche della seconda ] in @xcite . in the riemannian case ,",
    "it was solved by dini in dimension 2 and levi - civita in all dimensions .",
    "more precisely , dini has shown that locally , in a neighborhood of almost every point of a two - dimensional manifold , every two geodesically equivalent metrics are given by the form in a certain coordinate system .",
    "levi - civita has generalized this result to every dimension , we recall his result in section [ problem22 ] .",
    "unfortunately , the proofs of dini and levi - civita require that the ( 1,1)-tensor @xmath73 is semi - simple ( i.e. , has no jordan blocks ) , and that all its eigenvalues are real . if one of the metrics is riemannian , this condition is fulfilled automatically .",
    "examples show the existence of geodesically equivalent pseudo - riemannian metrics such that the ( 1,1)-tensor @xmath73 is not semisimple or / and its eigenvalues are not real .",
    "the examples exist already in dimension 2 : as it was shown in @xcite , the metrics from every column of the table       the general schema also works in higher dimensions , but in this case there is the following essential difficulty ( and this is the only difficulty ) : up to our knowledge , for dimensions @xmath74 , there is no description of all pairs of @xmath75 such that @xmath1 has lorentz signature and @xmath76 is an ( 1,1)-selfadjoint tensor such that it is covariantly constant , and such that the jordan normal form of @xmath76 is @xmath77 in dimension @xmath78 , since @xmath79 , the jordan normal form coincides with , and the local description follows from @xcite . in dimension",
    "@xmath80 we have @xmath81 and one can obtain the local description ( we will not do it in the present paper ) combining the results of @xcite with the algebraic description of possible holonomy groups of 4-dimensional metrics of lorentz signature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
