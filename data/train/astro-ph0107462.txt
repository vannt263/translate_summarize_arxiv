    "the interstellar magnetic fieldstrength and gas density are observed to be correlated ( troland & heiles 1986 , crutcher 1999 ) .",
    "this relationship is thought to arise from so - called ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes , in which the field is frozen to the ambient medium . under ideal mhd conditions ,",
    "if the ratio of mass to magnetic flux were everywhere constant , the slope @xmath0 of the fieldstrength - density correlation would be unity for compression normal to @xmath1 , zero for compression parallel to @xmath1 , and 2/3 for isotropic compression .",
    "the observed value of @xmath2 is approximately 0.5 , which is consistent with equilibrium models of self gravitating clouds which evolved under conditions of frozen flux ( mouschovias 1976 , tomisaka , ikeuchi , & nakamura 1988 ) .",
    "however , a number of observations and upper limits on magnetic fieldstrength suggest that @xmath3 is more an upper envelope than a scaling law .",
    "this is true both in atomic and molecular gas ( bourke et al . 2001 , crutcher 1999 , heiles 2001a , heiles & troland 2001 )",
    "although the number of measurements is small , and the field may be underresolved in some cases ( brogan & troland 2001 ) , the trend towards weak fields is clear .",
    "a different line of argument comes from numerical simulations of molecular clouds : padoan & nordlund ( 1999 ) claim that models with weak fields replicate the observations better than models with strong fields .",
    "weak fields are difficult to reconcile with ideal mhd .",
    "this is particularly so in the case of turbulent molecular clouds .",
    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are about 40 times more dense than the mean interstellar gas , suggesting that the magnetic field should be 6 - 7 times stronger than the mean field . if gmcs are formed by flows parallel to the field then of course the field would not be strengthened , but the mean field is not strong enough to resist compression and collimate the flows .",
    "furthermore , mestel ( 1985 ) has pointed out that accumulation of the mass of a gmc by compression in one dimension requires organized motion of the gas over nearly one kiloparsec , the origin of which is difficult to understand .",
    "thus , we seek an explanation for the weakness of the magnetic fieldstrength - gas density correlation beyond the scope of ideal mhd . at the very largest lengthscales , ideal mhd should be an excellent approximation . moving downwards in scale ,",
    "the first non - ideal effect encountered , at least at low ionization fraction , is ion - neutral drift , or ambipolar diffusion . at the ambipolar scale , which is many orders of magnitude larger than the resistive scale ,",
    "the magnetic field and plasma become decoupled from the neutral material .",
    "this makes it possible to change the mass to flux ratio without altering the magnetic topology .",
    "ambipolar drift has been invoked as the primary magnetic flux transport mechanism in dense , star forming gas since the classic paper by mestel & spitzer ( 1956 ) .",
    "however , it is thought to be too slow to be an effective transport mechanism in diffuse gas ( see  2 for quantitative estimates ) .",
    "interstellar gas is turbulent .",
    "turbulent diffusion of quantities such as heat and angular momentum is often invoked in astrophysics as a mechanism for enhancing transport rates above their kinetic theory values , which are usually very slow .",
    "turbulence enhances diffusion rates by mixing the relevant quantity to the small scales at which molecular diffusion operates .",
    "this leads to a mixing time which is approximately the eddy turnover time , and is nearly independent of the molecular diffusivity .",
    "whether turbulence enhances the resistive decay rate of a magnetic field is unclear , because there is substantial evidence that magnetic forces resist stretching the field sufficiently to mix it to the tiny scales at which resistivity operates ( cattaneo & vainshtein 1991 , cattaneo 1994 , cattaneo , hughes , & kim 1996 ) .",
    "this paper addresses a different question , namely , whether turbulence in a weakly ionized gas can transport magnetic field with respect to the neutral matter , without resistive dissipation necessarily coming into play . because the ambipolar drift scale is much larger than the resistive scale , the feedback effects which can suppress turbulent resistivity are far less dramatic , although they can not always be ignored .",
    "we use analytical methods to calculate the mixing rate .",
    "numerical study of mixing requires that numerical diffusion of both field and fluid be very well controlled .",
    "analytical calculations are useful for initial exploration of some of the basic mechanisms .    in  2",
    ", we introduce the physical model , derive an equation for the evolution of the mass to magnetic flux ratio in a weakly ionized medium , estimate relevant timescales , and establish an initial condition . in  3 , we estimate the turbulent diffusion rate based on mixing length theory , quantify this estimate with an exact calculation of transport by a wave , and argue that enhanced diffusion requires the introduction of small scales as well as bulk advection . in ",
    "4 we develop a model based on exponential stretching and shrinking .",
    "this model leads to a flux redistribution rate which is comparable to the eddy turnover rate , as expected in turbulent diffusion problems .",
    "however , the model is two dimensional , and the fluid motions are prescribed without specifically allowing for magnetic forces . in  5 , we consider magnetic feedback . in  6",
    ", we apply the model to the interstellar medium , and discuss the astrophysical constraints imposed by the dynamics .",
    "section 7 is a summary and conclusion .",
    "sections 3 and 4 are relevant to general mixing problems , such as turbulent diffusion of a passive scalar , and the reader who is mainly interested in the astrophysical implications could go directly to  6 .",
    "we consider a weakly ionized medium with magnetic field @xmath1 , mass density @xmath4 , and ion mass density @xmath5 .",
    "we are interested in timescales much longer than the ion - neutral collision time @xmath6 , in which case the ion - neutral drift @xmath7 is well approximated by @xmath8 ( shu 1983 ) .",
    "the magnetic field evolves according to the magnetic induction equation for a perfectly conducting medium @xmath9 replacing @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and approximating @xmath12 by the center of mass velocity @xmath13 , we rewrite the induction equation as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is given by eqn .",

    "the second term on the right hand side represents the evolution of @xmath18 caused by ambipolar drift .",
    "we now restrict ourselves to two dimensional , incompressible flows perpendicular to a straight magnetic field .",
    "this geometry captures the main effects under study , and is consistent with the nature of turbulence in a strong ,",
    "well ordered magnetic field ( strauss 1976 , sridhar & goldreich 1994 , goldreich & sridhar 1997 ) .",
    "we recognize that interstellar turbulence is frequently observed to be highly supersonic , and thus can not be entirely incompressible .",
    "we expect that compressible turbulence to result in magnetic flux transport just as incompressible turbulence does , but that magnetic feedback on the turbulence is stronger in the compressible case .    under the assumptions of incompressibility and two dimensionality , the line stretching term vanishes , and eqn .",

    "the diffusion of @xmath28 is nonlinear in the sense that @xmath29 .",
    "this nonlinearity can produce sharp fronts along surfaces where @xmath21 vanishes or is tightly folded ( brandenburg & zweibel 1994 ) , similar to fronts created by nonlinear thermal conduction ( zeldovich & raizer 1966 ) .",
    "resistive diffusion in these current sheets alters the mass to flux ratio as well as changing the magnetic topology ( brandenburg & zweibel 1995 , zweibel & brandenburg 1997 ) . in this paper",
    "we assume that the relative variation of @xmath30 is so weak that nonlinear effects play only a minor role in ambipolar drift , and @xmath21 remains nonsingular .",
    "equation ( [ lmixing ] ) can be used to derive an equation for the rate of change of @xmath21 within a comoving volume @xmath31 of fluid ; that is , a fluid element of fixed mass .",

    "if we take @xmath53 for gas of cosmic composition and @xmath54 , which is probably a conservative lower limit , then we find @xmath38 is of order 10@xmath55 yr for these systems .",
    "since this is much more than the 10@xmath56 - 10@xmath57 yr expected lifetime of an interstellar cloud , the diffusion rate must be enhanced by a factor of 10 - 100 in order to explain the flatness of the @xmath58 relation .",
    "mixing by eddies in the neutral gas requires that the magnetic field be frozen to the flow .",
    "the degree of freezing is measured by the ambipolar reynolds number @xmath59 , which is large under frozen in conditions ( zweibel & brandenburg 1997 ) . for eddies of characteristic size @xmath60 and speed @xmath61 , @xmath62",

    "the field in the tube diffuses into the ambient medium ; thus the motion causes net transport of @xmath21 .",
    "the transport is most effective when the diffusion time across the tube is comparable to the advection time @xmath82 because if @xmath83 , the flux tubes return to their original positions with nearly the same value of the field , while if @xmath84 the field diffuses too quickly to be advected by the flow .",

    "( [ comp ] ) , this distance is just @xmath80 .",
    "advective mixing accelerates the transport of @xmath21 only if @xmath87 , meaning that the motion consists of thin fingers which travel much further than their widths ( see ottino 1989 for discussion of mixing by fingers , or tendrils ) .",
    "such fingers are not seen in models of alfvenic turbulence , and it is not clear that they would form in a weakly stratified gas such as the interstellar medium . interpreted more broadly , the argument presented here shows that turbulent mixing requires more than just advection and dispersal ; it also requires the formation of small scales .",
    "now , we quantify this result .",
    "weak turbulence theory , in which turbulence is modelled as a superposition of randomly phased waves , can be used to compute the rate of turbulent diffusion ( eg .",

    "one partitions quantities into mean and fluctuating parts and calculates the average effect of the fluctuations on the mean part .",
    "we used this method in a previous study of ambipolar diffusion ( zweibel 1988 ) . in the present problem it is possible , as well as instructive , to solve the induction equation exactly instead of averaging it .",

    "( [ taumaxp ] ) we find @xmath224^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] equation ( [ taumaxt ] ) shows that tension forces are less important in long , thin structures , in which @xmath225 can be much less than one , than they are in flattened structures such as disks .",
    "the field is well frozen to the eddies as long as @xmath226 .",
    "little is know about interstellar turbulence beyond its gross energetics : the turbulent kinetic energy is at or above equipartition with the magnetic energy .",
    "energy injection by a variety of mechanisms , combined with nonlinear processes , should lead to a turbulent spectrum over a wide range in scales .    in principle , any weakly ionized interstellar structure which survives for several eddy turnover times is a candidate for turbulent ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we showed in  5 that the efficiency of turbulent ambipolar drift can be limited by the back reaction of magnetic forces . in the strictly 2d case , the increase in ambipolar diffusion rate is associated with the local buildup of magnetic pressure forces , and in the 3d case , by magnetic tension forces as well .",
    "we expressed these constraints in terms of lower bounds on the strain rates , or inverse eddy turnover times , such that concentration of the field occurs before deceleration of the flow .",

    "( [ taumaxp ] ) requires @xmath236 0.13 .",
    "if @xmath237 , turbulence on the scale of a tenth of a parsec or less can mix the magnetic field down to the ambipolar diffusion scale . on the other hand , eqn .",
    "( [ taumaxt ] ) requires @xmath236 0.09(@xmath238 ) , which is a more severe constraint , especially in a highly flattened structure .",
    "there is at least one type of h i structure in which flux freezing appears to be obeyed .",
    "magnetic fields in h i shells are observed to be quite strong , with magnitudes consistent with shock compression ( heiles 1989 ) .",
    "the same observations suggest that turbulence with alfvenic or slightly subalfvenic velocities is present . if these shells were not expanding , they would appear to fulfill the conditions for fast ambipolar drift , and their strong fields would be counterexamples to the theory . however , expansion of the shells at speeds of order 10 - 20 km / s adds new magnetic flux faster than it can diffuse upstream , while on the downstream side the ionization is too high for efficient ambipolar drift .",
    "thus , the field in the shells remains large .",
    "recent observations by heiles ( 2001b ) and heiles & troland ( 2001 ) of cold , moderately dense h i regions which have weak magnetic fields , alfvenic random velocities , and no observed association with shells appear to be better candidates for fast ambipolar drift .",
    "observations show that while interstellar magnetic fieldstrength and gas density are to some extent correlated , the fieldstrength is often lower than expected .",
    "this suggests that processes beyond ideal mhd may play a role .",
    "the flux to mass ratio is altered by ambipolar drift , but estimates of the ambipolar diffusivity @xmath239 predict that ambipolar drift is important only in very dense , strongly magnetized gas with substantial gradients on small scales .",
    "however , it is well established that turbulence can enhance the transport rates of quantities such as entropy and angular momentum .",
    "this motivated us to consider the effect of turbulence on the rate of ambipolar drift .",
    "enhancement by roughly two orders of magnitude would explain the observations .    as a first attempt on the problem , we considered the geometrically restricted case of a straight magnetic field , with a transverse gradient , mixed by 2d , perpendicular turbulence .",
    "in this situation , ambipolar drift is described by a nonlinear diffusion term [ eqn .",
    "( [ mixing ] ) ] . for simplicity",
    ", however , we approximated the diffusivity as linear .",
    "we showed by a mixing length argument , and then an explicit calculation (  3 ) that advection of the field by a periodic flow reduces its peak value . however , unless the motions are long and thin , like streamers , the rate of relaxation is no faster than relaxation by ambipolar drift alone .",
    "the missing ingredient is stretching and shrinking of scales , which in chaotic flows happens at an exponential rate . in ",
    "4 we modelled these exponential changes of scale by representing the flow as a sequence of randomly oriented hyperbolic stagnation points . with this model , and a parabolic initial condition for the magnetic profile , the advection - diffusion equation ( [ lmixing ] )",
    "can be solved exactly .",
    "the model predicts an exponential increase of the mean diffusion rate with time ( figure 1 ) , although with considerable variance from point to point ( figures 2 & 3 ) .",
    "the stagnation point model predicts that the field diffuses on a timescale comparable to the eddy turnover time , with only logarithmic dependence on the ambipolar diffusivity itself and on the original gradient lengthscale .    in  5",
    ", we estimated the back reaction of magnetic pressure and tension forces on the stagnation point flow , including weak three dimensionality .",
    "the relative deceleration of the fluid over one mixing time is given for pressure forces by eqn .",
    "( [ deltavpvbar ] ) and for tension forces by eqn .",
    "( [ dvvbart ] ) . comparing the deceleration time of a fluid element to the mixing time , we derived upper limits on the eddy turnover time such that deceleration is order unity or less within a mixing time [ eqns .",
    "( [ taumaxp ] ) and ( [ taumaxt ] ) ] .",
    "as we showed in  6 , these criteria can be satisfied in the interstellar medium without extreme assumptions about the size and velocity of the turbulent eddies , although they can not be wholly ignored .",
    "these estimates of feedback are conservative in the sense that a fully self consistent model of mhd turbulence can still produce fast mixing , as shown by maron & goldreich ( 2001 ) for spreading of a passive scalar .",
    "this conclusion may be dependent on geometry , however , as concluded by kim ( 1997 ) based on a study of turbulent decay of a _",
    "coplanar _ magnetic field caused by 2d incompressible motions in weakly ionized fluid .",
    "the outcome of these calculations is that turbulence is likely to have a major effect on the magnetic flux to mass ratio in the weakly ionized portions of the interstellar medium , making the magnetic field more uniform .",
    "the model presented here applies to regions with simple magnetic topology , filamentary structure , and no global cross - field flows .",
    "it follows that the strength of the field is not necessarily a good indicator of the dynamical processes which determine the gas density .",
    "although the results presented here are consistent with the conventional wisdom that turbulent mixing takes place in an eddy turnover time , it is important to recognize that they are not obtained from a full model of turbulence .",
    "we plan to extend this work to more realistic models which include compressibility , vorticity , and a self consistent treatment of magnetic forces as well as more general magnetic geometry .",
    "if the stagnation point model holds up in comparison with more complete models , it could be useful in other mixing problems .",
    "magnetic reconnection can also change the magnetic flux to mass ratio .",
    "lazarian & vishniac ( 1999 ) have argued that if the spectrum of interstellar turbulence extends to the resistive scale then reconnection takes place at the alfven speed .",
    "we have concentrated here on ambipolar drift because it does not require turbulent structure on such small scales ; if flux is quickly redistributed in the fully ionized portions of the ism then an alternative process is certainly required .",
