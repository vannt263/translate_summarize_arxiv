    "atomistic simulations are playing an increasingly prominent role in materials science . from studies of crystallization of clusters@xcite to large - scale simulations of fracture@xcite and grain boundary diffusion@xcite , atomistic simulations offer a microscopic physical view that can not be obtained from experiment .",
    "predictions resulting from this atomic level understanding are proving increasingly accurate and useful.@xcite    the effective interatomic interaction potential is the key ingredient in all atomistic simulation .",
    "the accuracy of the potential affects drastically the quality of the simulation result , and its functional complexity determines the amount of computer time required.@xcite much research effort has therefore been devoted to the design of potential energy functions.@xcite this is especially important in classical dynamics which , although quantum mechanical simulations have been progressing at a rapid pace in recent years , remains the most ( sometimes , the only ) affordable way to perform very large scale simulations in materials science . in this paper , we present a new carefully designed al - al interaction model , test its performance , and we apply it to the study of free energies in atomic scale simulations .",
    "the ability to compute free energies is essential to understand or predict many physical phenomena , from the stability of crystal structures , to the propensity to form defects or disorder , and to morphology changes and phase transitions .",
    "however , the determination of free energies from atomic scale computer simulations is a daunting task .",
    "approximate methods , mostly based on the harmonic vibrational properties of the system , are commonly in use to this end . here",
    ", we compare several possible versions of the so called quasi - harmonic approximation , using as reference accurate simulation using canonical or constant - pressure monte carlo methods and thermodynamic integration , focusing on the specific case of surface free energies .",
    "the goal is to provide a measure of the range of applicability of approximate methods for complex systems using a reliable al interaction model .",
    "previously developed interatomic potentials@xcite for the al - al interaction have mostly focused on bulk and molecular properties . in this work ,",
    "we analyze and generalize one of those models with special regard to surface properties , aiming as usual at describing al in as wide a range of chemical environments as possible , _",
    "i.e. _ ranging from bulk al to al surfaces and surface steps , and to small al molecules .",
    "the functionalities of the refined potential are found to extend significantly those of previous ones . as we are going to use an embedded atom interaction model , in this section we briefly review the basic ideas of this approach , describe the details of the model , and finally assess its quality .      in the embedded atom method",
    ", each atom in a solid is viewed as an impurity embedded in a host comprising all the other atoms.@xcite the energy of the host with impurity is , according to stott and zaremba,@xcite a functional of the unperturbed host electron density , and a function of the impurity type and position , @xmath0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the unperturbed host electron density , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the type and position of the impurity . here",
    "the energy of an impurity is determined by the electron density of the host before the impurity is added .",
    "the functional @xmath4 is a universal function , independent of the host , but its form is unknown.@xcite a simple approximation to @xmath4 is the so called local approximation , whereby the impurity experiences a locally uniform electron density.@xcite this can be viewed as the lowest - order term of an expansion involving the successive gradients of the density .",
    "the functional @xmath4 is then approximated by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a pair potential representing the electrostatic interaction , @xmath7 is the distance between atoms @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denotes the embedding energy .",
    "the total energy of the system is a sum over all individual contributions : @xmath11 a further simplification is introduced assuming that the host density @xmath12 at atom @xmath8 is closely approximated by a sum of the atomic densities @xmath13 of the constituent atoms , _",
    "@xmath14 , with @xmath13 being the contribution to the density at atom @xmath8 from atom @xmath9 .",
    "equation ( [ e_pot ] ) is the form commonly used for molecular dynamics simulations of metals , and is known as embedded atom potential .",
    "the ercolessi - adams interaction model for al was constructed with the so called force matching method@xcite and , in contrast to most other empirical models , it gives excellent structural and elastic properties for the bulk along with the correct surface interlayer relaxations at low - index surfaces .",

    "ab initio _",
    "calculations,@xcite whereas those predicted by most other embedded atom potentials differ drastically@xcite from _ ab initio _ results .",
    "we therefore started off from the ercolessi - adams potential to build our own refined al ",
    "al interaction . without affecting the elastic properties and the surface relaxation properties ,",
    "we introduced the following modifications to the model :    1 .",
    "an additional term was introduced in the pair potential @xmath6 in order to account for an exponential born - mayer  like repulsion at short al - al separation.@xcite this is a key requirement for studies of _ e.g. _ physical vapor deposition processes , where the energy of each single atom easily exceeds the thermal energy by as much as three orders of magnitude .",
    "2 .   in the low density region ,",
    "three parameters of the embedding function @xmath15 were changed in order to improve several reference quantities , namely the al@xmath16 binding energy , and vibrational frequency , and the adatom diffusion barrier height on the al(111 ) surface ( _ i.e. _ the energy difference between the surface binding site and the saddle point ) .",
    "3 .   a fifth - order polynomial cut - off function was introduced , smoothly bringing the potential to zero at an interatomic distance of 5.56  ( slightly larger than the third - nearest neighbor distance in bulk al ) .",
    "the total energy @xmath17 of a system containing al atoms in an arbitrary arrangement is written ( see sec.[theory ] ) as @xmath18 the atomic density @xmath19 in arbitrary units is given as @xmath20 the sum runs over all atoms that lie within the potential range @xmath21 ( 5.56  ) , which is enforced by the cutoff function @xmath22 .",

    "we address the bulk , the dimer , low - index surfaces and steps thereon , and self - diffusion on different low - index surfaces ; also included in this test section is the energy dependent sticking coefficient of high energy al atoms on al ( 111 ) .",
    "the changes to the potential significantly improved agreement with experiment and other theoretical predictions in several instances where errors were typically of order 50% .      by construction our model does not alter the equilibrium lattice constant @xmath37 , the cohesive energy e@xmath38 and the elastic properties of the previous model of ercolessi .",

    "lda techniques , provide a stringent test for the present empirical al - al interaction model .",
    "it is generally accepted that diffusion on flat metal surfaces proceeds by either hopping or exchange.@xcite in the two following subsections compare the results of the present model for these mechanisms with previous lda results .    _ hopping diffusion  _ during hopping diffusion the adatom is moving between minima of the potential energy surface , _ i.e. _  between stable or metastable binding sites .",
    "on the ( 111 ) surface the stable adsorption sites are the 3-fold fcc and hcp sites ; on the ( 100 ) surface there is single independent adsorption site , the four - fold hollow ; the ( 110 ) surface is analogous , with a five - fold site .",
    "hopping diffusion on the ( 110 ) surface is intrinsically anisotropic , since it can proceed perpendicular or parallel to the [ 1@xmath420]-oriented atomic rows , respectively via the short bridge or long bridge paths .",
    "the activations energies for the long and short bridge are labelled @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .    for each surface",
    "we performed total energy calculations for the adatom sitting at the adsorption site and at the bridge site . at the latter site",

    "calculations.@xcite fim studies@xcite find no anisotropy for the diffusion on the ( 110 ) surface , and report a barrier height of 0.43 ev for both paths .",
    "this discrepancy with our result is due to the fact that here we only addressed hopping diffusion for demonstrative purposes .",
    "in fact , exchange diffusion normal to the rows is known to have a barrier as low as @xmath45 0.6 ev , @xcite which restores a reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "_ exchange diffusion ",
    "_ diffusion by atomic exchange occurs as the adatom replaces a surface atom , which in turn pops up at an adjacent stable surface site .",

    "views on why diffusion by exchange is favorable for some metal surfaces is discussed in refs .",
    ", , , , and references therein . for al ( 100 ) , we calculated the activation energy for exchange diffusion ( see table [ diffusion_barriers ] ) and found it lower than for hopping , as do first - principles calculations .",
    "the quantitative agreement is reasonably good .",
    "the surface energy , defined as the difference between the energy of an atom at the surface and in the bulk environment , is usually calculated as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total energy of the slab , @xmath48 the total number of atoms in the slab , @xmath49 the number of atoms on each surface , @xmath50 is the total energy per bulk atom , @xmath51 is the area of each free surface of the slab , and the factor 1/2 accounts for the two free surfaces of the simulation cell ; periodic boundary conditions are applied in the planar directions .",
    "these formulas are not problem - free in general,@xcite but we have checked that they are in the cases of interest to us .",
    "we calculated the formation energies for the low index ( 111 ) , ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) al surfaces with the present al - al interaction model .",
    "the comparison of our results to those obtained in _ ab initio _ lda investigations , given in table [ surface_energies ] shows that the trends of surface energies of our al model are consistent with the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "we obtain all surface energies about 20% lower than the lda surface energies . keeping in mind the known lda overestimate of the binding energies ( the lda cohesive energy of al , 4.15 ev,@xcite is about 20% larger than the experimental value of 3.36 ev )",
    "the agreement between the two approaches is in fact excellent .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the energy per unit length of a step on a low - index surface is defined in terms of the energies of the low - index face and the vicinal surface used to simulate the step itself , and of the the geometrical parameters thereof:@xcite @xmath52 with @xmath53 the step - step distance , and @xmath54 the terrace length on the vicinal surface . in analogy to the surface energy , the step energy can also be expressed per step atom .",
    "although a stepped vicinal surface can be specified by its corresponding miller indices , this notation is not very convenient , as it does not indicate at first sight the geometrical structure of the surface .",

    "@xmath59 is omitted in this notation .",
    "for the two low index surfaces al ( 100 ) and al ( 111 ) , we calculated the formation energy of different steps . on al ( 100 ) there exist two monoatomic steps , the close - packed @xmath60-facetted and the more open @xmath61-facetted .",
    "the former belongs to the family of @xmath62-surfaces , the latter to the family of the @xmath63-surfaces.@xcite for the calculation of the step energies we used the al@xmath64 = al@xmath65 $ ] and the al@xmath66 = al@xmath67 $ ] surfaces .    on al(111 )",

    "for all these vicinals , the terraces separating the steps have the same width of 9 atomic rows .",
    "we have verified that step - step repulsion at these inter - step distances is already in the long - range elastic regime @xmath76 , @xcite the steps are far enough to extract their formation energy without an unknown bias from the interstep interaction .",
    "table [ step_energies ] lists the results for step formation energies , and compares them to _ ab initio _ data .",
    "the empirical al potential describes the step formation energies for the two different steps on al ( 111 ) in excellent agreement with first - principles calculations .",
    "more energy is needed to create steps on the close - packed al ( 111 ) surface than on the more open al ( 100 ) .",
    "the open step on the al ( 100 ) surface has a 20% larger formation energy than the close - packed step , in agreement with bond cutting arguments.@xcite      the dimer is a stringent test for an al - al interaction model , since atoms in a dimer experience a very different chemical environment compared to bulk or surface atoms .",
    "for al@xmath16 , our model yields a binding energy per atom of 0.70 ev and a bond length of 2.70  .",
    "the binding energy was indeed used as input to determine the model parameters , matching the lda value @xcite of 0.71 ev ( @xmath77ev experimental , ref . ) the lowest vibrational frequency is calculated to be @xmath78 = 290 @xmath79 , in excellent agreement with the experimental value @xcite of 284.2 @xmath79 .",
    "the predicted bond length of our model matches exactly the experimental estimate.@xcite thus , the present model describes satisfactorily the bonding of al in the rather extreme case of the al@xmath16 dimer .",
    "as the understanding of diffusion and growth requires a knowledge of the binding energies of small aggregates of adatoms , we also calculated the energy of two al adatoms sitting at neighboring fcc sites on an al ( 111 ) surface . the energy gain with respect to isolated adatoms",

    "i.e. _  the al ad - dimer is stabilized appreciably over separated adatoms .",
    "lda calculations@xcite yield a similar energy gain of @xmath81 ev .      during physical vapor deposition",
    "the al atoms emitted from the sputter source have a non - thermal energy distribution , with kinetic energies exceeding 10 ev .",
    "therefore the sticking coefficient , a key ingredient for a reliable modelling of metal film growth , can not be assumed to be constant and independent of the particle s energy as it is typically done . in order to elucidate the dependence of the sticking coefficient on impingement energy ,",
    "we start our simulations with the incident al atom placed outside the interaction range of the surface .",
    "its initial kinetic energy is set in the range of 0 to 125 ev , and its starting angle off the surface normal in the range @xmath82 to @xmath83 , which corresponds to typical ionized physical vapor deposition conditions .",
    "the trajectories of the incident atom , and of any other atom which may be etched away from the surface upon impact , are monitored until either a certain time span has elapsed , or the outcoming atoms ( in the case of reflection or etching ) have traveled a distance of 10  away from the surface . analyzing 200 trajectories per incident energy and angle , we collected a statistically significant sample of well - defined adsorption , reflection , and etching events .",
    "the relative probability of the sticking coefficient is calculated as the ratio of the number of adsorption events to the total number . the typical statistical error in the reaction probability thus determined is below 5 % .",
    "fig.[figure_2 ] depicts the sticking coefficient as a function of energy for al atoms imping normally on the surface ( solid circles ) or at an off - normal angle of 40@xmath84 ( open circles ) .",
    "the sticking probability varies strongly with the incident kinetic energy ; the angle to the normal also has a drastic effect .",
    "details of the molecular dynamics calculations are given in sec.[stickingdetails ] .",
    "further discussion and results on high energy deposition are reported in ref . .",
    "in this applicative section of the paper , we compare surface free energies of al computed using different levels of quasi - harmonic approximation , and thermodynamic integration via monte carlo simulations .",
    "the latter effectively functions as `` exact '' reference for the various harmonic approximation . before presenting the results , we briefly review the background theory of the different approaches .",
    "_ thermodynamic integration  _ the free energy can not be calculated as an ensemble average.@xcite the method of thermodynamic integration  @xcite circumvents this problem starting from the concept of stockmayer fluid , a fictitious system in which the interparticle interaction potential @xmath85 is gradually switched on from a known reference potential @xmath86 to the actual , full interaction potential @xmath87 ; the mixing of @xmath86 and @xmath87 into the effective potential is controlled by a parameter @xmath88 : @xmath89 the key relation of the method concerns the derivative of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath88 : @xmath90 the subscript @xmath88 means that the average has to be evaluated with the interaction potential @xmath85 . integrating the latter equation one arrives at the following expression for the free energy of the system of interest : @xmath91 the usual choice for the reference system is the einstein crystal ( _ i.e. _ a system of non - interacting harmonic oscillators with the interaction potential @xmath92 ) , whose free energy is @xmath93 with @xmath94 the debye temperature ( @xmath95 k for al  @xcite ) .",
    "the free energy of the real system can thus be obtained at any given temperature by a series of canonical monte carlo simulations .    a faster way to obtain the temperature variation of the free energy",
    "is to integrate the thermodynamical relation @xmath96 from a reference temperature upwards .",
    "this requires a simple ( _ e.g. _ ) monte carlo ensemble average of the energy for each temperature , and of course a reference value of @xmath15 from thermodynamic integration .    in summary , the free energy of the system at a reference temperature @xmath97 is determined with eq.([lambda_int ] ) ; then , the temperature variation from @xmath98 to @xmath99 is calculated using eq.([t_variation ] ) .",

    "as detailed below , thermal expansion is taken into account performing the nvt monte carlo calculations at the temperature - dependent lattice constant determined independently by npt molecular dynamics .    _ quasi - harmonic approach  _ a popular approach to free energy calculations is the quasi - harmonic approximation .",
    "thereby , the full interatomic potential is replaced by its quadratic expansion about the atomic equilibrium positions .",
    "the system is then equivalent to a collection of harmonic oscillators , and diagonalization of the corresponding dynamical matrix yields the squares of the normal - mode frequencies , _",
    "i.e. _ the phonon spectrum . in bulk systems",

    "the phonon spectrum of bulk al and of al ( 100 ) are displayed in fig.[figure_3 ] , upper and lower panels respectively ( for both calculations supercells comprising 50 layers stacked along ( 100 ) have been employed ) .",
    "a variety of surface modes appear in bulk gaps or split off from bulk band edges .",
    "these additional modes are the source of the different vibrational free energy of surface systems in comparison to bulk systems .",
    "the free energy in this approximation is calculated for lattice and geometrical parameters * a * at temperature _ t _ as @xmath113 the sum runs over all phonon polarizations @xmath9 and wave vectors @xmath114 in the brillouin zone , with @xmath115 the frequency of the corresponding modes .",
    "both the frequencies , and the internal energy @xmath116 of the ideal static lattice , depend on all the lattice and geometrical parameters @xmath117 .",
    "the latter include the bulk lattice constant and , for the surface , the additional geometrical parameters involved in relaxations or reconstructions .    in a bulk system the forces on each atom are zero by symmetry , independently of @xmath118 , so that it is strictly correct to neglect the first derivatives in the quadratic expansion of the potential energy .",
    "we have verified that the quasi - harmonic approximation does indeed work very well for the bulk even in comparison to thermodynamic integration . for a surface , the situation is different , since the interlayer spacings ( expecially those of the top surface layers ) will change with respect to the bulk , _",
    "i.e. _  the surface will generally either contract or expand .",
    "the average equilibrium positions of the near - surface layers ( the interlayer spacings in the case of simple relaxation ) are determined by the minimum of the free energy , but that is , of course , unknown a priori .",
    "in addition , the harmonic expansion is not strictly correct ( since the forces , _",
    "i.e. _ the derivatives of the internal potential energy are not zero at the free energy minimum ) , which is why one calls this the quasi - harmonic approximation to begin with .",
    "in fact , it is clear that there are several levels of approximation possible for the quasi - harmonic approach ; here we consider some of those :    1 .",
    "the computationally simplest way is to optimize the atomic configuration and calculate the phonons _ at zero temperature _ , and evaluate the free energy vs. @xmath99 using those ingredients for all @xmath99 . within this approach ,",
    "the quasi - harmonic approximation is strictly valid , as we expand the potential energy function around the equilibrium positions , and the @xmath99 dependence enters solely with eq.([fat ] ) . in real systems , of course , both the surface internal energy _ and _ the vibrational contribution to the free energy will change with @xmath99 , but it is a priori unclear to what degree this influences the result .",
    "2 .   another way to account for the effects of finite temperature is to take the @xmath119 atomic positions , rescale their coordinates as a function of the temperature according to the appropriate bulk thermal expansion coefficient , and recalculate the phonons ( and hence the free energy ) for the expanded lattice .",
    "this is a hybrid case in which @xmath99 not only affects the force constants , but also the surface internal energy .",
    "of course it is arbitrary to use the scaled @xmath99=0 interlayer spacings at non - zero temperatures .",
    "also , it should be kept in mind that the harmonic approximation is not strictly valid for the expansion of the potential energy around non - equilibrium positions .",
    "a further possibility is to rescale all the coordinates according to thermal expansion first , and then re - optimize all atomic positions ; the phonons and the free energy are calculated for that geometry .",
    "here one is consistent with the prerequisites of the quasi - harmonic expansion , but at the cost of getting wrong interlayer spacings at the surface .",
    "the real thing is of course to minimize the total free energy with a `` self - consistent '' adjustment of the atomic positions of all layers in the slab system , resulting in the thermodynamic equilibrium configuration of the surface system . in practice ,",
    "one starts with the bulk positions rescaled according to thermal expansion , and then adjusts the interlayer spacings of a few near - surface layers to obtain the minimum of the free energy .",
    "the major contribution is generally due to the first two surface layers , the only having a sizable displacement from the bulk interlayer spacing . in our calculations , we therefore changed @xmath120 by @xmath121 and @xmath122 by @xmath123 .",
    "we now compare the free energy of an al(100 ) surface calculated within the different quasi - harmonic approaches ( 14 ) described above , with the results of thermodynamic integration ; the latter effectively functions as exact reference since it takes the full potential into account , hence in particular all anharmonic contributions .",
    "we chose the ( 100 ) surface for demonstrative purposes , as intermediate between the closed packed ( 111 ) and the more open ( 110 ) surface .      in order to obtain the bulk lattice constant at different temperatures we first performed zero - pressure molecular dynamics simulation@xcite using our al potential . in the linear regime",
    "the expansion coefficient is @xmath124  / k , the experimental value being @xmath125  / k.@xcite deviations from linearity set in @xcite at about 500 k. the dimensions of the simulation cell with periodic boundary conditions correspond , in all subsequent calculations , to the bulk lattice constant at the relevant temperature .",
    "the surface free energy calculations imply the evaluation of the bulk free energy , and of the free energy of a slab system with two surfaces .",
    "the surface free energy is then determined with eq.([surf_formula ] ) .    in fig.[figure_4",
    "] we compare the surface free energy calculated with thermodynamic integration and the quasi - harmonic approach .",
    "all versions of the latter underestimate severely the temperature variation of the surface free energy .",
    "this is mainly due to the neglect of anharmonicity , which is also responsible for thermal expansion .",
    "a first important result is then that at temperatures @xmath126 , the harmonic approximation is inappropriate for al surfaces .",
    "note that the failure of the harmonic approximation for the present relatively high - temperature calculations does not affect the successes of this approach at low temperatures , an example being the recent first - principles calculations for be surfaces.@xcite the reason why those results are compatible with ours is clearly that we work well above the debye temperature of our system ( @xmath127 400 k ) , whereas the highest temperature considered in ref .",
    "is 750 k , well below @xmath128 1000 k ( as extracted from a debye - einstein model ) .",
    "of course , the quasi - harmonic approach will generally fail if applied to systems at sufficiently high temperatures .    to sort out the relative merits of the various levels of harmonic approximation",
    ", we focus on the effects of the interlayer spacing @xmath120 ( between first and second layer ) and @xmath122 ( between second and third layer ) on the surface energy and on the vibrational contribution to the surface free energy .",
    "essentially this is the fourth level of approximation mentioned earlier .",
    "we pick @xmath99=450 k for demonstrative purposes , and expand the lattice accordingly .",
    "panel ( a ) in fig.[figure_5 ] shows the variation of the plain surface energy as a function of the interlayer spacings ( expressed in turn in percentage of the bulk interlayer spacing ) .",
    "an increase of the interlayer spacings tends to increase the energy drastically , a decrease to reduce it .",
    "the minimum at around 3% for both spacings .",
    "these fairly unrealistic values result from the optimization of the interlayer spacing for a laterally expanded surface .    the excess surface free energy , _",
    "i.e. _ the vibrational contribution is shown in panel ( b ) of fig.[figure_5 ] .",
    "an increase of the interlayer spacings leads to softer force constants and hence to lower frequencies , which yield according to eq.([fat ] ) a more negative value of the surface excess free energy .",
    "the dependence on the first spacing is stronger than on the second , although conceptually both spacings would tend to positive infinity ( decoupled al planes ) if only the vibrational contribution mattered .",
    "the opposing tendencies of the internal and vibrational contributions tend to compensate ; in fact , summing up the plain surface energy and the vibrational contribution , one arrives at the total surface free energy depicted as a function of the interlayer spacings in panel ( c ) of fig.[figure_5 ] . for the al ( 100 )",
    "surface , the minimum in the free energy corresponds to @xmath129 % and @xmath130% , a compromise between the gain of free energy upon outward relaxation , and that in plain surface energy upon inward relaxation .    in approaches ( 1 ) and",
    "( 2 ) from our above list ( force constants from zero - temperature or rescaled zero - temperature posizions ) , the interlayer spacings are @xmath120=1.5% and @xmath122=1.3 % .",
    "these are rather close to the minimum of the free energy found by direct minimization in approach ( 4 ) ; indeed , with reference to fig.[figure_4 ] , both approach ( 1 ) ( solid line ) and ( 2 ) ( dashed line ) match rather closely the values of approach ( 4 ) ( crosses ) , _ i.e. _ of the full quasi - harmonic calculation .",
    "approach ( 3 ) ( dash - dotted line ) , where we rescaled the lattice constant and then re - optimized all atomic positions , fails badly , going astray already near the debye temperature , and progressively more so for higher temperatures .",
    "this is due to the incorrect ( free - energy  wise ) spacings imposed on the near - surface layers by the minimization of the internal energy .",
    "the spacings are found to be @xmath120=3.4% and @xmath122=3.1 % at 450 k , and @xmath120=5.8% and @xmath122=5.5 % at 900 k. a glance at panel ( c ) of fig.[figure_5 ] reveals that both of these points in the \\{@xmath131 } plane do indeed correspond to free energies very far away from the minimum ( especially at the higher temperature ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the most naive and simplest approach of exporting the @xmath119 force constants and surface energy to non - zero temperature does indeed underestimate considerably the temperature variation of the surface free energy with respect to thermodynamic integration , but it gives gives an agreement comparable to , or better than the sophisticated adjustment of the interlayers to find the free energy minimum .",
    "we have presented a refined al interatomic potential for classical dynamics and monte carlo simulations .",
    "we thoroughly tested its functionalities , finding it to be very accurate for a variety of systems .",
    "next , we applied it to evaluating the performance of quasi - harmonic approaches to free energy calculations for surfaces , comparing the latter results with full thermodynamic integration results . for al surfaces ,",
    "the quasi - harmonic approximation shows a progressively increasing error for temperatures above @xmath132 .",
    "different levels of quasi - harmonic approximation have been compared ; for al , the simplest method of using zero - temperature phonons to compute the free energy at all temperatures is as accurate as the explicit minimization of the free energy with respect to geometrical parameters .",
