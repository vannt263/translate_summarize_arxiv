    "the analytical study of the @xmath0 boson is essential for the understanding of many open questions related to the electroweak physics , like the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking and the source of the @xmath1 violation . since its discovery",

    "is contained in the boson s angular distribution in three dimensions , given by its differential cross section , which can be written as a sum of helicity cross sections .",
    "these quantities are related to the nature of the electroweak processes , the @xmath0 polarization , and the presence of qcd effects . in this paper",
    "we address these issues in the case of @xmath0 produced in hadron collisions .",
    "the total differential cross section of the @xmath0 production in a hadron collider @xcite is given by the equation : @xmath2 \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the @xmath0 in the lab frame and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the charged lepton from the @xmath0 decay in the collins - soper ( cs ) frame @xcite .",
    "the cs frame is used because in this frame we can experimentally reconstruct the azimuthal angle @xmath6 and the polar quantity @xmath7 .",
    "our ignorance of the @xmath0 longitudinal momentum , which is due to our inability to measure the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino in a hadron collider , introduces a two - fold ambiguity on the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is the angles - integrated unpolarized cross section .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on the leptonic variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 is completely manifest and the dependence on the hadronic variables @xmath10 and @xmath4 is completely hidden in the angular coefficients @xmath11 .",
    "this allows us to treat the problem in a model independent manner since all the hadronic physics is described implicitly by the angular coefficients and it is decoupled from the well understood leptonic physics .",
    "the angular coefficients are ratios of the helicity cross sections of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 . in order to explicitly separate the hadronic from the leptonic variables ,",
    "the helicity amplitudes were used to describe the hadronic tensor associated with the hadronic production of the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the leptonic tensor on the other hand is analytically known , leading to analytic functions of the angles of the charged lepton in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "it is common to integrate equation ( [ eq1 ] ) over @xmath4 and study the variation of the angular coefficients as a function of @xmath3 .    if the @xmath0 is produced with no transverse momentum , it is polarized along the beam axis because of the v - a nature of the weak interactions and helicity conservation . in that case",
    "@xmath12 is the only non - zero coefficient .",
    "if only valence quarks contributed to the @xmath13 production , @xmath12 would equal 2 , and the angular distribution ( [ eq1 ] ) would be @xmath14 , a result that was first verified by the ua1 experiment @xcite .    if the @xmath0 is produced with non - negligible transverse momentum , balanced by the associated production of jets , the rest of the angular coefficients are present and the cross section depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath6 as well . the last three angular coefficients ",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17  are non - zero only if gluon loops are present in the production of the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to study all the angular coefficients and associated helicity cross sections of the @xmath0 in a hadron collider , we have to consider the production of the @xmath0 with qcd effects at least up to order @xmath18 .",
    "the importance of the determination of the @xmath0 angular coefficients is discussed in @xcite , and is summarized here .",
    "this study allows us to measure for the first time the differential cross section of the @xmath0 and study its polarization , since the angular coefficients are related to the helicity cross sections .",
    "it also helps us verify the qcd effects in the production of the @xmath0 up to order @xmath18 .",

    "the shapes of the muon distributions are the same as that for electron @xmath0+jet events , however less events are detected , because of the lower muon acceptance of a typical hadron collider detector .",
    "the main reason for the difference between figures [ f1 ] , [ f2 ] and figures [ f6 ] , [ f7 ] is the leptons transverse momentum cuts ( @xmath58 gev and @xmath59 gev ) and the charged lepton rapidity cut ( central leptons are considered , @xmath60 ) .",
