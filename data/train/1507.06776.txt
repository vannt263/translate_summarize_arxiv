    "in the standard @xmath1cdm cosmology @xcite large galaxies form through the merger and accretion of smaller galaxies . we are fortunate to be witness to this process with the ongoing accretion of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy @xcite onto the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "its proximity provides a unique opportunity to study accretion in detail , through the tidally stripped streams that straddle the sky .",
    "there have been considerable efforts to create simulation models of the sgr accretion , including @xcite . however , the model most used by the community is that of @xcite [ hereafter lm10 ] , designed to fit much of the observational data known to that date .",
    "a recurring theme in the study of the tidal tails of sgr is their use as a probe of the mass and shape of the mw dark matter halo , for knowledge of the orbit of the sgr dsph is invaluable in constraining such models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . but no consistent and agreed solution has been achieved",
    ". further observational data on the actual orbit , especially at larger galactocentric radii , will provide additional constraints on models of its accretion , and hence the dark matter profile of the mw .",
    "many stellar tracers have been used to study the sgr streams .",
    "an early study used carbon stars @xcite but significant progress came with @xcite who found that m - giants revealed details of the leading and trailing tidal streams ( arms )  data that informed the lm10 model . since its publication , the lm10 model has been tested against observations of stars  their positions , proper motions and velocities .",
    "it captures many of the main features of the streams , and has become a benchmark for such studies .",
    "indeed , many regions of the streams are now relatively well characterised up to a distance of @xmath050 kpc by a variety of other tracers including horizontal branch stars @xcite , rr lyrae @xcite , red clump stars @xcite , upper main - sequence and main - sequence turn - off stars @xcite .    despite its success in reproducing many features of the observed data ,",
    "the lm10 model has some limitations .",
    "for example , it does not explain the  bifurcation \" seen in the actual stream @xcite , prompting suggestions @xcite that there may actually be two progenitors , with separate streams emanating from each .",
    "other deviations from the lm10 model have also been found : using rr lyrae , @xcite find no evidence of the leading arm at low right ascension  although expected from the model .",
    "similarly , @xcite , see no suggestion of the sgr trailing arm in rr lyrae in the sky just north of the galactic plane .    beyond about 50 kpc ,",
    "the data are more ambiguous .",
    "for example , @xcite each describe a halo feature , located at a distance of @xmath090 kpc ( the  gemini arm \" ) , which has been recently attributed to the trailing arm of the sagittarius stream .",
    "if the gemini arm were part of the trailing arm of the sgr stream , it will have a great impact on the possible orbit of the progenitor .",
    "these data are far from the model , as seen on the sky and in distance , indicating that the lm10 model requires serious revision .",
    "clearly there is much work still to be done to understand both the nature of the progenitor of sgr , and its fateful journey around the galaxy during accretion .      in this paper",
    "we return to the study of carbon stars as a tracer population , the first to reveal the extent of the streams @xcite . specifically , we focus of those carbon stars that exhibit clear variability .",
    "there are a number of reasons for doing so .",
    "firstly , there are newly published lists of halo carbon stars , enlarging the sample .",
    "secondly , the ability of the period of any variability to give a good estimate of distance is now better understood thanks to studies of the magellanic clouds . and",
    ", finally there is now an excellent set of  almost \" all - sky , variable star , data available in the catalina surveys @xcite .",
    "carbon stars possess properties that make them good probes .",
    "they have photospheric c / o ratios that exceed one , and so show distinct features of c@xmath2 and cn in their spectra , making their identification simple even in relatively low - resolution spectra .",
    "the strong band heads also aid velocity determination @xcite , making them good kinematic probes . for example",
    ", they have been used to study the kinematics of the outer regions of the galactic disk @xcite , the galactic halo @xcite , the lmc @xcite , and the smc @xcite .",
    "the population of carbon stars is composed of a complex \" zoo  of many types and with a variety of origins @xcite , and whose original classification was determined by the presence of certain spectroscopic features .",
    "n - type stars have substantial absorption at the blue end of the spectrum , while r - types stars still show the blue end of the spectrum , and ch stars have strong ch absorption .",
    "the j stars exhibit very strong isotopic bands of c@xmath2 and cn .",
    "there are two types of explanation as to how carbon finds itself on the surface of the star : intrinsic and extrinsic .",
    "the intrinsic carbon stars are formed by internal processes , in which the carbon products of helium burning mix into the convective envelope and are brought to the surface .",
    "one major process is the third dredge - up ( tdu ) , which occurs on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , creating the classic n - type carbon stars , which typically pulsate and are losing mass .",
    "recent work @xcite suggests that the cooler , late - type r carbon stars are the same as the n - type , although possibly sitting nearer to the bottom of the agb phase .",
    "the warmer , early - type r stars are , by contrast , near the red clump , and may be formed through an anomalous he - flash .",
    "extrinsic carbon stars are formed by the accretion of carbon - rich material from a donor star within a binary system .",
    "these are normally identified ( in stars at high galactic latitudes ) by high radial velocities  ch stars , for example  @xcite .",
    "similar are the nearby so - called \" carbon dwarfs  ( dcs ) .",
    "the first was discovered by @xcite and was subsequently found to be a binary system @xcite , in which mass transfer has taken place on to a dwarf star .",
    "these dcs can , however , be identified by their high proper motion .",
    "the agb carbon stars are the main focus of this paper .",
    "they are luminous and so can be detected to large distances @xcite , and our primary interest is in the outer halo of the mw .",
    "due to a minimum stellar mass required for the tdu to occur ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such carbon stars are also seen as representatives of young to intermediate - age populations  and hence of the accretion of younger stars than is typical of the halo .",
    "it should be noted , however , there is still some uncertainty about the minimum mass with new models allowing carbon stars at lower mass , at low metallicity @xcite .",
    "unsurprisingly , given the variety of carbon star types , early work using carbon stars to probe the mw halo constantly encountered the problem that they possess a wide variety of intrinsic luminosities in a range of passbands @xcite .",
    "using agb ( n and late - r type ) stars alone might be expected to reduce the problem .",
    "thus , @xcite assumed a single value of @xmath3 mag .",
    "but even n - types have a wide range of absolute visual magnitudes as determined from hipparcos distances @xcite .",
    "@xcite use a standard @xmath4 calibrated against lmc carbon stars , but with the additional refinement of including ( @xmath5 ) colour .",
    "this approach gives better results , as nir data take the mass - loss that is characteristic of n - type carbon stars into account .",
    "the uncertainties of distance determination using carbon stars can be considerably reduced if the carbon star is a long - period variable ( lpv )  as most agb stars are  as we can exploit period - luminosity relationships ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but carbon stars are rare  and those with clear and measurable variability more so .",
    "the challenge is to garner a statistically significant sample of such variable carbon stars .",
    "this paper tries to do so by drawing together all carbon stars in the halo that are to be found in the literature .    being giants , and often suffering significant mass - loss , the stars of interest are typically very red .",
    "for this reason , the largest sample we use is drawn from the large list of 2mass - selected carbon stars by mauron and his collaborators , having colours most consistent with being agb carbon stars .",
    "we also draw on other samples , but many of these have used spectra at the blue end to identify carbon stars , and so preferentially select the bluer early - type r stars , ch stars and dwarf carbon stars .",
    "using long - period variables also allows us to be more confident that we are dealing with agb stars , and we adopt a minimum period of @xmath080 days for our selection .    with agb carbon stars , we should be able to trace the sgr dwarf tidal features to large distances .",
    "carbon stars that do not lie on the streams may indicate the presence of previously undetected wraps of the sagittarius stream , helping constrain its orbit .",
    "alternatively they could point to new , or confirm previously proposed , substructure .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows : the data we use are described in  [ data ] .",
    "the methods used to derive distances are given in  [ methods ] .",
    "the results are presented in  [ results ] . in ",
    "[ noperiods ] , we study those carbon stars for which we do not have period data . the results are discussed in  [ discussion ] , and we summarise in  [ summary ] .",
    "our sample of carbon stars are drawn from a variety of sources in the literature and are all spectroscopically - confirmed .",
    "they have very different means of detection , selection criteria and spatial coverage .",
    "the galactic disk , being young , contains many carbon stars , but in this paper we are concerned with potential halo structures , hence we focus on those at high galactic latitudes .    the final selection of carbon stars is divided into two catalogues .",
    "there are those stars for which we have measurable periods from the catalina surveys ( hereafter called the  first sample \" ) .",
    "note that these stars are listed in table [ tab : first_sample_catalog ] , and are identified throughout this paper by the prefix  hg \" followed by a running number .",
    "a  second sample \" contains those carbon stars for which we do not have good variability data .",
    "these stars are listed in table [ tab : second_sample_catalog ] and have the prefix  hg2- \" .    for our study , we are interested in the agb stars , the n - type and late - r types .",
    "our samples below rely to a large extent on the classifications given by the authors of the various papers . in some cases ( such as @xcite ) each star",
    "is specifically classified from its spectrum . in others ( such as the many mauron group papers )",
    ", a general comment is made that properties of the sample are consistent with them all being agb stars .",
    "and in a few cases ( in particular those carbon stars found during searches for other types of stars ) , there is no indication of which sub - type they belong to .",
    "however , we use the colours of the stars to mostly assist in attributing them to agb stars . in the few cases where the stars lie outside this colour selection , we use available spectra or other information to decide whether to include them in our sample .    for our purposes",
    "we require that the stars sit on the luminosity - period relationships .",
    "note that we accept  candidate \" lpv carbon stars , and so may have some ch stars in our sample , for example , which may mimic low - amplitude agb stars .",
    "however , as we are primarily concerned with tracing distant halo structures , we are willing to accept a few contaminants . one aim of this study is to locate good candidate carbon stars that may trace previously unknown halo substructure .",
    "these stars can be used as targets for deep imaging to reveal any features in the fainter , but more numerous , tracer populations .",
    "given that such features may be found over the whole sky , having such targets is a very cost - effective means of seeking new substructure .",
    "our primary source , providing just over half of all our variable carbon stars , comes from the lists published by the mauron group @xcite .",
    "these were selected from candidates based on 2mass @xcite photometry and then spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "those from @xcite and @xcite have radial velocities determined , while the later papers do not give velocities . for @xcite they had access to the second incremental data release of 2mass , only about half the sky ; their subsequent work , however , exploited the all - sky 2mass data .",
    "to identify carbon agb star candidates they employed the 2mass colours of known carbon stars , which lie in a known linear feature in the ( @xmath6 colour plot , selecting stars @xmath70.15 mag from the median line .",
    "initially they limit this sample with the cuts on colour ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 and ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 , and a faint magnitude limit ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "they exclude a region either side of the galactic plane , only going down to @xmath13b@xmath13 @xmath14 25@xmath15 . for later papers in the series they enlarged the selection criteria to @xmath16 , @xmath13b@xmath13 @xmath14 20@xmath15 and ( @xmath5 ) @xmath17 mag .",
    "one star in the mauron sample ( # 80 in their numbering scheme ) is actually an s - type , and is removed from our list .",
    "we also exclude their m56 , m57 and m58 , which they note are known ",
    "warm carbon stars \" ( all with a ( @xmath5 ) @xmath18 ) , and not agb stars , and which they observed to provide comparison spectra across a range of carbon star types .",
    "the published errors on heliocentric velocities , where given , are @xmath71012 kms@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "certain stars have entries that require comment : @xcite report a typographic error for star hg2 - 51 ( m15 in the mauron numbering system , which uses a preceeding m ) in their earlier paper @xcite .",
    "its heliocentric radial velocity is 158 and not + 158 kms@xmath19 .",
    "hg75 ( m43 ) has a greater heliocentric velocity ( + 54 kms@xmath19 ) in @xcite compared to the more recent observation ( + 15 kms@xmath19 ) of @xcite .",
    "such differences are not totally unexpected , however .",
    "significant differences 30 kms@xmath19 have been found between the velocities obtained by absorption and emission lines and between optical and radio lines @xcite .",
    "the reasons are not clear , but they recommend using absorption lines rather than balmer emission lines for velocity determination . in our table",
    "we use the mauron value of hg75 for consistency with the rest of the table sample , as the velocity difference does not significantly affect our conclusions . for hg89 and hg92",
    "we obtain radial velocities from @xcite .",
    "@xcite believe the majority of the sample in that paper to be agb stars on account of : their colours , the presence in half of h@xmath20 emission , and the fact that two - thirds have spectra ( in which the wavelength range permits ) that rises to the red side . in their later papers",
    "they only note that the spectra are typical of n - type stars .",
    "we also include the carbon stars from the first byurakan survey ( fbs ) for which the mauron group undertook additional spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "for a few stars , the new spectra clearly show them to be n - type .",
    "the mauron sample provides the largest number of carbon stars , but a review of the literature reveals the following additional samples .",
    "many of these are also duplicated between themselves , or with the large mauron sample . in these cases , the reference for the star given in table [ tab : first_sample_catalog ] either indicates the first report of the star , or the reference that provided us with the most data .",
    "a number of carbon stars have also been found serendipitously during searches for late - type dwarf stars  based on their 2mass colours  by @xcite , and for whom carbon stars are contaminants .",
    "fortunately , they published the status of these .",
    "as contaminants , the authors only state that they are carbon stars , and give no indication of the sub - class , so they may include ch , dc and early - r type carbon stars in addition to the late - r and n - types .",
    "@xcite use the following selections :    @xmath21    with additional cuts in the nir colour - colour diagram of :    @xmath22    and    @xmath23    they obtained spectroscopy from facilities in both the northern ( kitt peak observatory ) and southern ( cerro tololo inter - american observatory ) hemispheres . hence",
    ", their sample covers much of the sky except for the galactic plane . @xcite and @xcite essentially use the same selections as @xcite .    @xcite selected candidates with the following constraints :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 magnitudes are obtained from usno - a ) .",
    "that is , they focus on the southern sky .",
    "later in their programme , they reduced the magnitude and colour cuts to : @xmath26 and @xmath27 mags respectively .    a similar , but much smaller , 2mass - based sample of carbon stars",
    "was published by @xcite , possessing  very red \" nir colours , and high galactic latitudes ( they too were interested in objects in the halo , not the disk ) .",
    "these stars are heavily dust enshrouded .",
    "of these , there is only a velocity for hg44 ( iras 08546 + 1732 ) from @xcite .",
    "they present spectra , and note that all are consistent with being n - type .",
    "@xcite list a sample of carbon stars that were serendipitously discovered in an apm ( automatic plate measuring ) survey for high redshift quasars ( which also appear as very red , faint stellar - like objects ) .",
    "the apm survey covered the whole of the northern sky away from the galactic plane(@xmath2830@xmath29 ) , and much of the southern sky ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "candidates were selected on optical colour @xmath30 and magnitude @xmath31 and the equivalent poss1 o and e colours and magnitudes .",
    "they undertook follow - up spectroscopy and give classifications for their sample , based on these spectra .",
    "we exclude those stars which they classify as ch - type , but include hg21 ( their 0351 - 1127 ) which they classify as borderline ch / n - type .",
    "the radial velocities also come from @xcite , except for hg60 , where a more recent value is given in @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have searched through the sdss database and generated catalogues of carbon stars , identified from the sdss s own spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "most of these carbon stars are rather blue in colour , due to the sdss passbands , but a handful of agb stars have been picked up .",
    "the sdss catalogues also provide velocities , but  as @xcite notes ",
    "these are derived from fitting to templates that do not include carbon stars .",
    "hence we do not use these values .",
    "for example , in one case ( hg45 ) @xcite report a heliocentric velocity of 200 @xmath710 kms@xmath19 , which is very different from the sdss catalogue value of 313 kms@xmath19 .",
    "we do , however , adopt the @xcite value .",
    "we have spectra for all these , and include those that clearly have n - type spectra , and one carbon star that is a candidate late - r type ( see section [ r_star ] ) .",
    "many of these are among the most distant carbon stars and so we discuss these later in section [ distant_stars ] .",
    "the few stars that do not appear in these surveys ( and mostly listed in @xcite ) , include : hg2 - 35 ( cgcs 6480 ) from @xcite , found serendipitously during a search for emission line galaxies ; and hg90 ( cgcs 3801 ) from @xcite found during a search for agn in the fields around two galactic globular clusters .",
    "@xcite provide one , hg28 .",
    "@xcite created a catalog of 403 faint high latitude carbon stars from a region of 6,400 deg@xmath32 , from the hamburg / eso ( he ) objective prism survey .",
    "this covers dec@xmath33 and @xmath34@xmath29 . the vast majority of these are not variable , and of those few that are , most are found in other lists described above .",
    "one exception is hg121 ( he 2319 - 1534 ) .",
    "it is difficult to be certain about completeness for a sample that is assembled from a set of heterogeneous lists .",
    "but one limitation we have arises from our use of catalina surveys data ( see  [ variability_data ] ) which excludes the regions around the galactic plane , magellanic clouds , and the equatorial poles .",
    "@xcite discuss their sample selection in some detail , and we can extrapolate their findings to estimate how well we recover the agb carbon star population within the catalina footprint . using",
    "the colour cuts that we described above , they have an initial list of @xmath01200 objects in the 2mass second incremental data release , which covers 19,600 square degrees of sky .",
    "however many of these are , for example , distant galaxies . after cleaning this initial list , they finally have @xmath0200  good \" candidates .",
    "the catalina surveys cover 33,000 square degrees , so we would expect @xmath0340 comparable carbon star candidates in this region .",
    "@xcite also report that some 30% of the 97 stars for which they actually obtained spectra were carbon - rich stars , the remainder being oxygen - rich .",
    "thus naively one might expect that just over 100 stars will be found in the catalina surveys .",
    "we actually find 121 in our lpv sample , with a few dozen other stars that although carbon stars , do not have good light curves .",
    "thus we will have found all carbon stars that match the @xcite  good \" candidates .",
    "of course , there may be many agb carbon stars that did not match their  good \" criteria , which are not given , and where the criteria may have been too stringent .",
    "another measure of the coverage of our sample is to compare it to the sample of the lpvs from @xcite .",
    "they use data release 1 of the catalina surveys , which only reached down to a declination of 20@xmath29 , and so does not cover the region south of this ( nor the region of the northern equatorial pole ) .",
    "we create a test sub - sample from our lpv ( first ) sample by applying these cuts for sky location .",
    "we also apply appropriate cuts to the drake et al .",
    "sample with @xmath35 , and @xmath13b@xmath3620 , to make it comparable to ours .",
    "this leaves us with two sub - samples ( fig .",
    "[ fi : compare_with_drake14_sample ] ) . of the 87 drake",
    "et al . stars ( filled circles ) , which include both carbon - rich and oxygen - rich stars , our sample of carbon stars ( diamonds ) matches to 37 , some 42% .",
    "we can compare this match to @xcite where some 30% were shown to be carbon stars .",
    "so we believe that we are recovering most of the carbon stars in the drake et al .",
    "sub - sample , the remainder being oxygen - rich .",
    "( those drake et al .",
    "stars that are known to be m stars ( oxygen - rich ) , from the simbad or vizier databases , are marked out with open squares in fig .",
    "[ fi : compare_with_drake14_sample ] . )",
    "however , what is notable is that we have many lpvs in our sample that are not found in the drake et al . sample .",
    "we believe a number of reasons may explain our greater success rate .",
    "firstly , drake et al . fail to detect many low amplitude stars .",
    "they compared their sample to the linear ( which we describe below in  [ variability_data ] ) variability survey and found that they missed those stars with an amplitude @xmath37 0.1 mag .",
    "secondly , they appear to have only used the folded light curve when visually selecting their variable stars .",
    "many of our stars have odd folded light - curves , but are more convincing in the full light - curve ( e.g hg24 , hg92 and hg104 ) .",
    "thirdly , the drake et al .",
    "dr1 data covered a shorter duration ( to june 2011 : about mjd 55,700 compared to dr2 which extends to @xmath0mjd 56,500 ) .",
    "if a light curve is sparse , our longer period will reveal periodicity that may be less obvious in dr1 ( e.g. hg12,hg14 , hg91 , hg109 and hg119 ) .",
    "these light curves are shown in the online material accompanying this paper .",
    "however the light - curves and period fits for three stars ( hg1 , hg2 and hg3 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : lc_phase_power_plotting_hg1_hg3 ] , to show typical examples .",
    "nonetheless , there are still many stars in our sample and that have good light curves in catalina which did not make it into the drake et al . sample .",
    "the lead author of that paper ( ajd ) visually inspected a remarkable @xmath0112,000 stars , so it is not unexpected that some true lpv stars might slip through the process .",
    "so , although we recover the expected proportion of their sample , there remains some uncertainty as to the completeness of that sample , and by extension to ours .",
    "the fact that our input lists of carbon stars are so heterogeneous can partially help here .",
    "they combine data found in both the optical and nir , from both the northern and southern hemispheres etc .",
    "thus selection biases inherent in one will be compensated by others . in summary , it is extremely difficult to have a true measure of completeness for our sample .",
    "however , given the arguments above we believe that we are finding the majority of the variable agb carbon stars in the region of sky covered by the catalina surveys .",
    "we also investigate the variability properties , if any , of known carbon stars in satellite galaxies of the milky way .",
    "these galaxies have well - established distances , and can be used to check our procedures .",
    "the stars used are listed in table [ tab : satellite_catalog ] .",
    "there are 26 previously published spectroscopically - confirmed carbon stars in the sgr main body @xcite .",
    "we find that three have detectable periods in the catalina surveys data ; those at the highest right ascension .",
    "the others are not in the catalina surveys as they lie too close to the galactic plane .",
    "we also have two of the variable stars listed in @xcite , giving a total of five known sgr carbon stars .",
    "none of the carbon stars from the sgr main body given in @xcite are in the catalina surveys , as they also are too close to the galactic plane , and outside its footprint .",
    "we use the @xcite list of carbon stars in the fornax dwarf .",
    "we can identify long - period variable ( lpv ) stars more effectively than @xcite , as the catalina data are in the optical whilst they used nir photometry , and the amplitude of variability is known to be greater in the optical than in the nir @xcite .",
    "also they have 15 epochs over three years , whilst we have many more epochs over a seven year period .",
    "thus we get periods for stars that they do not .",
    "note that one star ( star # 105 in their table 2 ) is listed as having a period of 340 days , but of 270 days in the caption to their fig 9 .",
    "we obtain a period of 280 days , so we assume the shorter value was intended .",
    "one of the @xcite stars is also in the mauron sample ( m30 in their numbering system  our s19 ) .",
    "we also include any additional new carbon stars from the fornax dsph , into our input list , given in @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide lists of carbon stars for the sculptor , carina and leo ii dsph galaxies .",
    "sculptor carbon stars are also given in @xcite .",
    "certain mauron stars are already known to be within mw dsph galaxies : their star m4 ( our s25 ) is in the sextans dwarf galaxy , and is discussed more detail below .",
    "their m29 ( our s1 ) is in sculptor , and discussed in @xcite and @xcite . as with the fornax dsph star from the mauron sample ,",
    "we consider them as part of the satellite carbon star sample .",
    "we can characterise the ensemble properties of the full set of our sample , and compare their properties to our examples of mw satellite carbon stars .",
    "the stars from the mw satellites are not included in the  first \" sample , but are used only for calibration and comparison .",
    "figure [ fi : all_jh_hk_plot_unc_s2 ] illustrates the consequences of the different selection techniques made for each sample on their location in the nir colour - colour plots .",
    "the upper right of the plot is populated by 2mass - selected stars , while those derived from optical imaging  such as the @xcite and the sdss @xcite samples  are found preferentially toward the blue end .",
    "note that many of the previously published carbon stars in the mw satellites are found in the blue region , due to their discovery on photographic plates .     against @xmath38 ,",
    "uncorrected for reddening .",
    "the points are the variable carbon stars in table [ tab : first_sample_catalog ] .",
    "the different symbols represent either the source of the carbon star , or in the case of the mw satellite carbon stars , the host galaxy .",
    "the dotted region illustrates the approximate region selected by the mauron group .",

    "one significant result is that although the majority of our input lists were based on all - sky surveys ( e.g. 2mass ) , the majority of the carbon stars in our study appear as though they can be attributed to the sgr streams .",
    "this is particularly true for those for which velocity ( v@xmath81 ) data are available , but is also the case for central ( ra against heliocentric distance ) and bottom ( ra against dec ) panels .",
    "many carbon stars trace the leading arm across much of its length , and a group of them at @xmath82300@xmath29 are very close the main body of sgr ( which itself lies near the galactic plane and hence is not in the catalina surveys ) . in many cases we can allocate the stars to either the leading or trailing arms ( green and red points respectively in figure [ fi : multi_plot_lm10_t1_random_s2 ] )",
    ".    the apocentre of the trailing arm in the lm10 model , centred at @xmath82100@xmath29 , contains no carbon stars .",
    "this is not totally unexpected as much of it lies behind the galactic plane .",
    "but , even taking this in consideration , there are very few stars in the region of the trailing arm apocentre just north of the galactic plane .",
    "this may suggest that the lm10 model is not a good representation of the trailing arm .",
    "note that all of the ( three ) carbon stars that appear to sit in the arm at the appropriate distance ( middle panel of figure [ fi : multi_plot_lm10_t1_random_s2 ] ) , and that are marked with green open circles , are actually in the southern galactic hemisphere , and associated with the lmc ( see lower panel ) .",
    "it is worth commenting on a number of stars .",
    "two stars ( hg11 and hg23 ) stand out as inconsistent with lm10 , sitting either side ra = 50@xmath29 , and at a distance of @xmath060 kpc .",
    "both these have properties ( period , colour and amplitude ) that place them close to the boundary between the c and c@xmath50 sequence in figure [ fi : soszynski_period_jk_plot_short_s2 ] .",
    "they also have v@xmath81 values ( 86 and 156 km / s ) , however , that are consistent with them sitting in the trailing sgr arm .",
    "hence , we believe that these are actually c sequence stars , not the c@xmath50 that our selection attributes to them . if this is the case , it demonstrates the caution that we must exercise in using these selections near the boundary .",
    "hg107 , which was discussed in  [ properties_of_sample ] , at ra@xmath83 and a distance of 50 kpc is quite likely ( given its nir colours ) not an agb star .",
    "we can also look at the locations of our first sample stars in galactocentric cartesian coordinates ( fig .",
    "[ fi : multi_plot_xyz_lm10_s2 ] ) .",
    "again it is striking that the majority of our sample is consistent with much of the lm10 model .",
    "the distant carbon stars that we attribute to a16 , the gemini arm are at the edge of the plots .",
    "it is also easier , in this representation , to see the apparent lack of sgr stars  in the x vs. z plot , just above the galactic plane and affecting both the leading and trailing arms .",
    "the two stars that we believe may be mis - assigned c@xmath50 can also be seen .",
    "there are six carbon stars with estimated distances that are greater than 100 kpc .",
    "some of these are somewhat blue compared to the rest of the first sample , which arouses suspicion that they may be ch , early - r or dc stars .",
    "the spectra for four of these six stars are available from the sdss , and we also plot the spectrum for another sdss star at 68 kpc ( fig [ fi : multi_plot_sdss_spectra_s2 ] ) .",
    "four show classic n - type spectra , with little flux below 4500 , and all four of the stars more distant than 100 kpc showing balmer emission .",
    "all four except hg66 , show very good light curves .",
    "although the spectrum of hg45 has a low signal - to - noise , it is consistent with a carbon star .",

    "the left panels show the full spectrum for 4000  9000 , and the right panels show the corresponding region for 40005000 , where the g - band sits at @xmath04300.,width=340 ]    the distant carbon stars are apparently associated with other tracers , and all are likely related to structures which are already known .",
    "these are labelled on the middle panel of figure [ fi : multi_plot_lm10_t1_random_s2 ] as 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "many other stars of the sample can be attributed to known substructures .",
    "we now discuss each of these groups and features in more detail , followed by the closer substructures .",
    "feature 1 comprises two carbon stars at a distance of @xmath0100 kpc at ra @xmath01030 .",
    "these are probably associated with a feature known as a16 , detected in m - giants by @xcite , who show it to be a rather large and diffuse structure at a distance of 100 kpc and stretching 20@xmath29 either side of ra = 0 .",
    "a16 encloses the previously reported and better known ",
    "pisces overdensity \" , a feature found in rr lyrae @xcite in the sdss stripe 82 , lying at a distance of @xmath080 kpc , and by @xcite in catalina data , at ra from 350360@xmath29 .",
    "the large extent of a16 makes it more plausible that our carbon stars are associated with this structure .",
    "it is possible that hg118 may also be part of a16 , but due to its much greater distance ( @xmath0180 kpc ) and uncertaintly over its nature we do not include it as such .",
    "feature 2 comprises two distant carbon stars ( hg39 and the closer hg45 ) that sit near a feature first found in bhbs by @xcite , further studied in @xcite , and later denoted the  gemini arm \" by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , argue that the gemini arm is actually the true location of the apocentre of the trailing arm of sgr stream , explaining why that part of the lm10 model has not been seen at the distance expected in the area north of the galactic plane .",
    "the gemini arm is particularly apparent in the rr lyrae of @xcite .",
    "they also comment on several of the most distant rr lyrae , which they think may be distinct from the main body of the gemini arm .",
    "these more distant rr lyrae lie close  on the sky  to hg39 , and are also at about the same distance .",
    "it is significant that these rr lyrae come from the mls component ( which reaches much deeper than the css and sss surveys ) of the catalina surveys , but which is only 20@xmath29 wide , straddling the ecliptic .",
    "these distant rr",
    "lyrae stretch across the full width of the mls strip , and so likely cover a wider region of the sky , possibly including the position of hg39 .",
    "@xcite report two kinematically distinct , but spatially close , groups of rr lyrae stars ( denoted cancer a and cancer b ) .",
    "they both lie at the same location in the sky and distance ( @xmath086 kpc ) , but differ in radial velocity : the rr lyrae of cancer a have a v@xmath81 of 78 kms@xmath19 ( @xmath84 = 12 kms@xmath19 ) , while those in cancer b have a v@xmath81 of 16.3 kms@xmath19 ( @xmath84 = 15 kms@xmath19 .",
    "the v@xmath81 of hg45 ( 114@xmath710 kms@xmath19 ) might argue against a connection with the gemini arm , but it may be related to cancer a , given the offset in distance between it and the rr lyrae .",
    "feature 3 lies near  but somewhat more distant than  the apocentre of the leading arm of the sgr stream .",
    "it comprises only one carbon star ( hg66 ) at a distance of 125 kpc , but is surrounded by a number of other tracers .",
    "this group of objects is rather diffuse , and appears to extend from the known apocentre of the sgr arm to a distance of more than 100 kpc .",
    "these stars may be part of the sgr leading arm proper , or they may be a distinct , more distant feature .",
    "a hint of an extension to the leading arm was seen in @xcite , and the other tracers suggest that the situation at this location is complex . in the central panel of figure [ fi : multi_plot_lm10_t1_random_s2 ] ,",
    "rr lyrae from @xcite can be seen at this location . again  as noted earlier  these are from the mls which has limited sky coverage , and the actual number of rr lyrae at this distance may well be greater .",
    "further tracers in this region include two giant stars from @xcite , which they suggest may have come from an older wrap of the sgr streams .",
    "there are also bhbs @xcite , six of which lie in two velocity groups : four at v@xmath81@xmath020 kms@xmath19 , and two at @xmath050 kms@xmath19 .",
    "@xcite argue this represents stars at the turn - around of an elliptical orbit , although as their bhbs do not lie on the model of @xcite , they do not argue for an association with sgr .",
    "another carbon star , hg57 , also lies at a large distance at this right ascension , but sits far to the south of the other tracers .",
    "this star is isolated from any known halo structure , and so we assign as  unclear \" .      star hg32 is some 7.7@xmath29 on the sky from the centre of the lmc , compared to the tidal radius for the lmc of @xmath0 17.1@xmath29 @xcite .",

    "these include the anti - centre stream ( acs ) of @xcite , and the monoceros overdensity @xcite",
    ". of these only monoceros has been detected south of the plane @xcite .",
    "two of our stars ( hg40 , hg41 ) stand out as having velocities inconsistent with the lm10 model .",

    "it position on the sky , and its derived distance ( 52 kpc ) place it in the apocentre of the sgr leading arm , accompanied by many other carbon stars .",
    "width=321 ]      the star s25 , found in sextans @xcite , has been previously reported by @xcite , using their own photometry , which has fewer data points than in the catalina surveys .",
    "we analysed this star in more detail , as a carbon star with such a long period ( and hence not old ) is not expected in this dwarf galaxy , which is metal - poor and primarily composed of an ancient stellar population @xcite .",
    "the light curve and initial fit of s25 are also shown in the appendix , to be consistent with the full sample . however , it was sufficiently of interest to warrant further analysis .",
    "the extensive catalina data have been supplemented linear observations , to reveal some of the behaviour prior to the catalina data being taken .",

    "this correction is then applied to the css data for the subsequent analysis .",
    "the light curve ( figure [ fi : sextans_mag04_alllcs_art_plot_p4 ] ) shows it suffers from an obscuration event in the the region from mjd 54,60055,900 days ( between the red vertical lines ) , with a drop of over four magnitudes .",
    "a fit to all the catalina surveys data ( the red curve in figure [ fi : sextans_mag04_alllcs_art_plot_p4 ] ) seems to explain the obscuration event as actually being part of a longer secondary period .",

    "even we exclude the dip , with its larger uncertainties , the total range in amplitude of the combined linear and catalina surveys data is still over 3.8 magnitudes .",
    "this compares to a range of @xmath03 mags for s1 , ( m29 in the mauron numbering system ) .",
    "@xcite found that m29 in the sculptor dsph is undergoing substantial mass - loss , and if s25 is similar it will provide an additional example of the production of carbonaceous dust in a metal - poor environment .",

    "we exclude from our first sample , as this period lies far from the region in which we could expect the period - luminosity relation to hold . hence it is not in table [ tab : first_sample_catalog ] , but we place it in table [ tab : second_sample_catalog ] , using its luminosity to estimate a distance .",
    "it has been suggested that stars having periods longer than @xmath01000 days are massive enough for hot bottom burning ( hbb ) to occur @xcite .",
    "this will result in carbon being consumed and the carbon star turning into an o - rich star @xcite .",
    "the carbon stars with the longest period in the lmc are just below 1000 days @xcite .",
    "so this carbon star is quite unexpected .",
    "@xcite have models in which a very low metallicity star may become c - rich if it is massive ( @xmath87 ) , due to a very efficient hbb in which the on cycle is activated , leading to the depletion of oxygen @xcite .",
    "however , the v@xmath81 of hg2 - 42 places it in the sgr leading arm , and the distance derived using nir photometry , is also consistent with a location in the sgr leading arm .",
    "although circumstantial , this does suggest that it may not be a very massive star , but a normal agb star with a very long period .",
    "this idea may find some support from @xcite who find a group of 10 miras with p@xmath141000 and amplitudes in the i - band of @xmath884mag .",
    "as they exhibit regular variability , they assume they are o - rich , not c - rich",
    ". however , we found that is not the case for shorter period stars ( in that many of our carbon stars show very regular light curves ) , so maybe there are carbon stars among this group of 10 . by extension",
    "there may be a population of very long period carbon miras that have hitherto not be found due to their scarcity .",
    "for many stars in our input lists ( see  [ data ] ) we do not have periods .",
    "this can occur for a number of reasons . in many cases",
    "the star lies outside the catalina surveys footprint , in others the catalina light curves have too few ( or too noisy ) data - points to obtain a period fit , or show no obvious variability . and finally , in some cases , the light curves exhibit behaviour that prevents a period fit being made .",
    "this is often the case for very bright stars in which the catalina data are saturated . for these stars we use the more common method of distance estimation from nir photometry alone .",
    "we were encouraged to do so when we found that the distances obtained by mauron et al .",
    "using @xmath52-band magnitudes and @xmath74 colours were relatively consistent with those derived by using periods .",
    "this consistency may , of course , only be the case for those agb carbon stars which have well - behaved light curves , or at least are shown to be variable . therefore although we include the stars without periods in this section of the paper , we caution against drawing very strong conclusions from them .",
    "we include a list of them here , to encourage further observations of those with weak light - curves , or none at all ( i.e. those not in the catalina footprint )    we remove stars classified as ch - type by @xcite , and those in the list of ch - stars of @xcite , as these will not fit the relation that is true of agb stars .",
    "of course in some of our sources , an object is reported as a carbon star , without further details as to the sub - type , so one must be further cautious of the results from the second sample . to address this problem , we also exclude those stars for which @xmath89 , as such blue colours are typical of ch - stars ( e.g. see fig . [ fi : all_jh_hk_plot_unc_catagories ] ) , unless they are noted as c(n ) by @xcite .",
    "finally , we remove stars for which @xmath90 , as these will all be in the disc .",
    "this new sample , which we term the  second sample \" is shown in table [ tab : second_sample_catalog ] .",
    "we now estimate the distances of the second sample stars following the approach of mauron et al .",

    "the equation(s ) used by mauron et al . to estimate distances",
    "are not given , so we re - derive them from the data given in their papers .",
    "we use the reddening corrected nir photometry and derived absolute @xmath52-band magnitudes from @xcite and @xcite to obtain two fits :    @xmath91    @xmath92    we can test these in more detail by comparing the distances obtained from periods , against those from nir photometry alone , for our first sample ( see fig .",
    "[ fi : plot_period_nir_distances ] ) . given the distance errors the correlation is remarkably good .",
    "a few outliers are outside of the estimated distance uncertainties : hg118 , hg77 and hg106 .",
    "the first two of these have given us problems before : hg118 has a weak light curve and was found to be an outlier in fig .",
    "[ fi : multi_dist_jk_period_plot_errs_s2 ] , hg77 is one of the bluer stars with a very short period .",
    "hg106 also has a weak light curve .",
    "equations [ eqn : jk_to_mk_1 ] and [ eqn : jk_to_mk_2 ] are then used to derive estimates for @xmath4 and then distances for the stars in our second sample .",
    "this approach effectively assumes that the carbon stars are all on the c sequence .",
    "hence any that are , in fact , c@xmath50 or d will have incorrect distances . but without period and amplitude data , it is difficult to know which sequence our sample stars belong to .",
    "the exception to this occurs if the @xmath74 colour is greater @xmath02 , in which case it is reasonable to assume that it lies on the c sequence ( see figure [ fi : soszynski_period_jk_plot_s2 ] ) .",
    "some stars in this sample have published velocities , which are also given in table [ tab : second_sample_catalog ] , and can increase our confidence of whether they lie in known halo substructures .    the good correlation in the two methods of distance estimation seen in fig .",
    "[ fi : plot_period_nir_distances ] may , of course , be a result of the nature of sub - sample of carbon stars that are found in the first sample .",
    "that is , the first sample have variability properties that make the use of nir photometry appropriate .",
    "many stars in the second sample , however , show either no , or erratic , variability . for this reason ,",
    "we repeat our note of caution from above .",
    "although we believe that the distances are indicative for the sample as a whole , individual stars may have estimated distances that are incorrect . due the additional uncertainties of this sample",
    ", we do not attribute the second sample stars to substructure as done for the first ( lpv ) sample .",
    "looking at the position of this second sample in velocity , distance and location ( figure [ fi : multi_plot_lm10_t1_second_random_s2 ] ) a few results are immediately apparent .",
    "firstly , many more stars ( shown as asterisk symbols in the figure ) than our  first \" sample have positions that place them close to the mw disk .",
    "this is because many of these stars are too luminous to obtain good light - curves in the catalina surveys ; they become saturated , making curve fitting impossible .",
    "we also see many stars that are almost certainly in the lmc ( either side of ra , dec @xmath0 90@xmath15 , 70@xmath15 ) and smc ( surrounding ra , dec @xmath0 15@xmath15 , 70@xmath15 ) .",
    "most of these have no light - curves as they are in the region excluded from the catalina surveys due to crowding in the imaging .",
    "others are beyond the southern declination limit of the surveys .",
    "the second sample carbon stars nearby to the smc reach to a projected sky distance of 4.3@xmath29 , equivalent to @xmath04.7 kpc , a value consistent with the recent results of @xcite , who found evidence of an intermediate - age population up to 6.5 kpc from the centre of the smc .",
    "so these stars are consistent .",
    "one interesting feature are the several  second sample \" carbon stars at distances @xmath14100 kpc , and that lie close to the features identified in the first sample .",
    "one lies close to the a16/pisces overdensity , at a distance of over 150 kpc , in  feature 1 \" .",
    "three second sample stars lie beyond the apocentre of the sgr leading arm , from 100160 kpc in  feature 3 \" ; two on the lm10 model ( on the sky ) , and the third is not far from it .    finally , hg2 - 26 is particularly interesting .",
    "its location on the sky ( ra , dec @xmath0 106@xmath15 , 24@xmath15 ) , and its estimated distance of 65 kpc would place it in the region of the trailing arm in which no other tracers have been found .",
    "it is in the catalina data , but with too few data points to obtain a good light curve .",
    "if we use the same distance uncertainty used for the first sample , based on the @xmath74 colour , this star could be at a distance from @xmath04790 kpc",
    ". the lower value would be consistent with the lm10 model , while the upper value would locate it in the gemini arm ( which of course may be the true sgr trailing arm ) .",
    "the catalina data for this star range over 3 magnitudes in the v - band , suggesting it also suffers from episodes of obscuration , and that the uncertainty in the distance may be greater still .",
    "in the following discussion we focus on the results from the first sample ( table [ tab : first_sample_catalog ] ) , rather than those for which distances have only been obtained from magnitude ( table [ tab : second_sample_catalog ] ) , due to the far greater uncertainties associated with second sample .",
    "a major finding of this study is that the majority of the first ( lpv ) sample can be understood as being part of the sgr streams , being consistent in location , distance and velocity ( where available ) .",
    "this highlights the importance of the sgr accretion in the history of the mw halo , especially as seen through intermediate - age tracers , such as carbon stars .",
    "this result suggests that there has been little recent merger activity of massive dwarf galaxies onto the mw , except for the sgr dwarf , and any progenitors of the features discussed above .",
    "of course , our lpv sample in particular , avoids the galactic plane , so any accretion events occurring in the plane would not be detected .",
    "this finding is consistent with the view that the mw has had a quiescent history @xcite .",
    "specifically , accretion into the field halo by satellites with extended sfh has been unimportant for the last @xmath08 gyr @xcite .",
    "however , older , more metal - poor satellites may well have been accreted , or are still being so , in the more distant halo .",
    "however , we find  as many others have using a variety of tracers  that the lm10 model is not a good fit to the data along its full spatial extent",
    ". there does indeed appear to be a lack of carbon stars in the trailing arm north of the galactic plane , where the model suggest a relatively high stellar density ( and as noted above ) .",
    "only hg2 - 26 is plausible as being consistent with the lm10 , but  as noted earlier  it could equally be part of the gemini arm .",
    "the lack of the trailing arm in the region predicted by the lm10 model has been reported before .",
    "for example , @xcite have also found that their rr lyrae show little of the lm10 trailing arm at ra = 110@xmath29 at a distance of @xmath040 kpc .",
    "but our data are also ambiguous with regards to the leading arm south of the plane .",
    "although we have carbon stars that we attribute to sgr in this region , they are few",
    ". moreover , many of these may in fact be part of the monoceros overdensity .",
    "such a result , as with the trailing arm in the north , is not totally new .",
    "other tracers have either not been detected in the leading arm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or have been only detected to a minor extent @xcite , in this region of the sky .",
    "another result is the presence of a handful of carbon stars at very large distances , greater than 100 kpc .",
    "feature 1 is almost certainly part of the pisces overdensity , and feature 2 is very likely tied up with the  gemini arm \" .",
    "feature 3 is more difficult to explain .",
    "as these stars lie on the sgr orbital plane , one plausible explanation is that they arise from older wraps of the sgr streams , lost on previous orbits , especially if the gemini arm is indeed the actual apocentre of the sgr trailing arm .",
    "the idea that the most distant carbon stars may be older wraps of sgr is consistent with @xcite who argues that it lost an older , more metal - poor , component in the older wraps , and then the younger more metal - rich component in the youngest wraps ( the arms shown in figures [ fi : multi_plot_lm10_t1_random_s2 ] and [ fi : multi_plot_lm10_t1_second_random_s2 ] ) .",
    "for example , hg39 has a period of 210 days and hg66 of 149 days .",
    "the shorter periods are indicative of a greater age than the majority of the sample .",
    "an alternative scenario @xcite suggests that both the pisces overdensity and the gemini arm can be best explained as the tidal features of the progenitor of the virgo overdensity ; a feature that is located at a distance of @xmath0 15 kpc , over a large area of sky of the sdss footprint above the galactic plane .",
    "curiously , we have no obvious candidate carbon stars for this structure , whereas we have examples in both the pisces overdensity and gemini arm .",
    "an obvious issue concerns the reliability of the distance determination for the handful of very distant carbon stars .",
    "one concern might be that they lie in the plane of the sgr orbit because they may actually be in the main arms of the streams ( i.e. up to 60 kpc ) and are just projected to larger distances by failings in our approach .",
    "however , these stars have well - behaved light curves and bluish colours . as discussed above ,",
    "the spectra of four of the most distant stars are n - type .",
    "we doubt that the nir data have been affected by obscuration events that may confound the p - l relationships ; there is no evidence that these suffer erratic and dramatic changes in their light - curves ( as seen in s25 ) , in which the 2mass nir data would not be representative of the period covered by the catalina surveys light curves .",
    "the long duration of the catalina surveys , some seven years , is invaluable in assessing this .",
    "by contrast , as we have seen above , other carbon stars were difficult to assign cleanly to the c or c@xmath50 sequences , and some proportion of them may be closer , if they are indeed c@xmath50 stars .",
    "however , as we are interested in using these stars as potential tracers of distant structure , this issue can be addressed through follow - up observations .",
    "deep imaging in the regions near these objects should reveal any halo features at the indicated distances .",
    "in addition to the many carbon stars in sgr , and the distant stars which are in halo structures which may or may also not be associated with sgr , we found lpv carbon stars in other known substructures . in particular , we find a clear group in triangulum - andromeda feature , and several that are likely in the gas .",
    "less clear are the stars we attribute to the hac , primarily as the true extent of this feature is still uncertain .    the most interesting feature , for our purposes ,",
    "are the two carbon stars near to the starkenburg group 6 .",
    "even though we assign these carbon stars as  unclear \" , the grouping in velocity , distance and location strongly suggest that this is a genuine halo feature .",
    "follow - up imaging in this region should provide a definitive answer .",
    "this is the best candidate for  new \" substructure .",
    "finally , there are several isolated carbon stars which are not close to any known substructure",
    ". these may be contaminants ( e.g. non agb stars ; possibly hg107 , for example ) that have fallen into our sample due to our generous selection approach , or they may indicate unknown halo sub - structure .",
    "what is remarkable is that there are so few .",
    "this is even more so when one considers that some of the stars that are not easily attributed to a substructure are also those with the most uncertain light curves ( e.g. hg64 and hg72 ) .",
    "one of our conclusions , that the majority of the carbon stars are associated with sgr , is quite different from that of @xcite .",
    "they argue that the halo carbon stars were too young to be from the sgr streams , based on the distribution of periods for their sample .",
    "they argued that their sample has too many shorter period lpvs than would be expected if the sgr dsph were a relatively old to intermediate - age system .",
    "but we suggest that their conclusion is based on a spatially biased sample . in figure",
    "[ fi : histo_sample_periods_p4_s2 ] , we plot the distribution of periods for our first sample ( single hatched ) , and those we attribute to sgr ( cross - hatched ) .",
    "the peak for the sgr stars is at 200  250 days , not the 250  350 days found by @xcite .",
    "however , they had an implicit selection , due to observational constraints , of a declination less than 20@xmath29 .",
    "if we apply this same selection to the first sample ( solid fill ) , we too find a shift in the peak to the longer periods , 300350 days , consistent with @xcite .",
    "this shift in period distribution is most likely due to the large proportion in this sample of carbon stars that lie close the main body of sgr .",
    "there is known to be an age - metallicity gradient along the streams @xcite , so the stars near sgr have been recently stripped from the main body and so represent a younger population than the bulk of the sgr stream stars .",
    "( solid fill ) , comparable to the sample of @xcite .",
    "the vertical dashed lines delineate the ages adopted by @xcite .",
    ", width=321 ]    however , the age of the carbon stars is unclear .",
    "the short periods of many of the carbon stars should indicate an older age .",
    "a plot of @xmath4 against @xmath74 colour ( figure [ fi : all_jk_mk_disky_plot_p4_s2 ] ) shows where the lpv samples sit in relation to the isochrones of @xcite .",
    "the majority of the sample lies between the isochrones ( with a metallicity of [ fe / h ] =  0.7 , an average value for the sgr body and arms , @xcite ) for 1.5 and 2.0 gyr , suggesting that the sample is relatively young .",
    "alternatively , we could be seeing the consequences of the wide range in metallicity ( @xmath0 1 dex ) observed in sgr and its arms .",
    "the total sample looks very similar in distribution to the carbon stars in the fornax dsph , which had a fairly continuous star formation , from 14 gyr ago until as recently as 0.25 gyr @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the process of accretion triggered star - formation in the sgr dsph over the last few gyr created both a spread in metallicities and ages , or that it contained a range of populations at the time of accretion .",
    "it is not obvious why this inconsistency between the ages implied by the period of variability and the colour - magnitude diagram occurs , although there are still unsolved issues in agb evolution , and the models may require further refinement .",
    "recently @xcite found that , from their models , the numbers of tp - agb stars are  boosted \" by a factor of @xmath02 for ages from 1.57 to 1.66 gyr .",
    "this may help explain the the presence of so many of our sample ( and the mw satellite carbon stars ) seen in figure [ fi : all_jk_mk_disky_plot_p4_s2 ] , and which sit between the 1.5 and 2.0 gyr isochrones .",
    "-band magnitude against ( j - k@xmath93 ) colour .",
    "red squares indicate stars that lie in our disklike region ( see text ) , and green squares indicate stars that are in sgr .",
    "also shown are isochrones from the tool cmd 2.5 @xcite , for a metallicity ( z ) of 0.004 ( [ fe / h ] = 0.7 ) and ages of 1.5 ( green ) and 2.0 ( blue ) gyr , using the bolometric corrections of @xcite and dust compositions of 0.85 amc ( amorphous carbon ) + 0.15 sic for c - rich stars and 0.6 alox+0.4 silicate for the o - rich stars @xcite .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines shows the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) value of @xmath4 for [ fe / h ] = 0.0 ( upper ) and [ fe / h ] = 2.5 ( lower ) from @xcite .",

    "we have revisited the use of carbon stars as tracers of halo substructure , with a particular focus on the sagittarius dsph tidal streams .",
    "carbon stars on the agb have always promised the opportunity to trace intermediate - age stellar populations to large distances in the mw halo .",
    "any such features will likely be the remnants of disrupted satellite galaxies .",
    "the potential of these stars has been difficult to realise as they can have a wide range of luminosities , making distance determination imprecise . by using variable carbon stars ,",
    "we exploit period - luminosity relations to obtain new estimates of their distances .",
    "our own sample suffers from the inherent uncertainty in our nir photometry , due to it being single epoch only , but in many cases these distance uncertainties are comparable to those found in the use of other tracer populations .",
    "this study been made possible by the availability of the recently released catalina surveys data release 2 light curves .",
    "these cover a large part of the sky and have data over a duration of seven years , allowing analysis of stars whose periods can be more than a year .",
    "the relatively large number of carbon stars that we have assembled from the literature means that those with inadequate light - curves can be excluded from our  first sample \" , such that we have confidence in the results from this sample of lpv carbon stars .",
    "almost all of the stars in our  first sample \" can be allocated to known substructures .",
    "the majority can be reasonably assigned to the tidal streams of sagittarius .",
    "other features that possess agb carbon stars are the hercules - aquila cloud , the galactic anti - centre streams , the lmc and triangulum - andromeda .",
    "we also find that the lm10 model is consistent with many of our sgr carbon stars .",
    "however , we also find two possible regions of failure in the model .",
    "there is a distinct lack of carbon stars in the trailing arm north of the galactic plane ( except for the highly - schrouded hg2 - 26 and its associated large uncertainty in estimated distance ) , and evidence of the leading arm south of the plane is also weak . due to their location",
    "near to the galactic plane ( with the consequent crowding and high extinction ) , it is difficult to draw very strong conclusions , but these apparent carbon star deficiencies remain a challenge for the model .",
    "the regions involved are also confused by the presence of other known substructures : the anti - centre streams , monoceros , and the hercules - aquila cloud .",
    "future observations to obtain velocities for many of these carbon stars may be valuable in identifying their parent . as crucial will be data that can probe closer to the galactic plane than hitherto , as it is in this region that the fate of both the leading and trailing arms should become clearer .    despite two decades of study ,",
    "the sgr accretion still poses many questions .",
    "the bifurcation is still unexplained , and the gemini arm has been suggested as related to either the sgr dsph or to the virgo overdensity .",
    "it is no surprise that @xcite remark that the  sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy remains a riddle , wrapped in a mystery , inside an enigma \" .",
    "carbon stars provide new probes in the far halo which may point to solutions to these problems .",
    "they are too few in number to say much on their own .",
    "but if the distant halo carbon stars are representatives of a wider stellar population then deep imaging of the regions around these stars may reveal new stellar substructure , and its nature if present .",
    "in particular , imaging of the regions around the very distant carbon stars , and those few that lie away from known substructure would be invaluable .",
    "notably , we find that the trianglum - andromeda feature ( triand ) stands out prominently in our data , and we strengthen the likelihood that the starkenburg group 6 indicates a _ bone fide _ halo feature .",
    "very few of our first sample stars are located in regions where no known substructure is thought to exist .",
    "one aim of this paper is to identify possible targets for follow - up , hence we have taken a generous approach to the agb star classification , as they add little overhead to follow - up , yet may indicate substructure which will show up in deep imaging .",
    "the small number of stars with no attribution facilitates this .",
    "we have also highlighted several stars which possess unusual properties .",
    "further observations of these objects ( e.g. photometric monitoring or high - resolution spectroscopy ) might throw new light on them , and thus on the carbon star population more generally .    in conclusion",
    ", we suspect that almost all of major intermediate - age substructure in the milky way have been found already .",
    "there may , of course , be features hiding behind the region of the galactic plane or towards the galactic poles , which are not properly covered by our study .",
    "the carbon star population has also shown that it can still surprise , with the complex nature of these objects still able to provide examples that fit no easy classification .",
