    "type i bursts were observed , testifying to the presence of an accreting neutron star .",
    "cen x-4 was observed several times in quiescence ( asai et al .",

    "1997 , 2000 ; rutledge et al .",
    "the spectrum was fit with a soft thermal component ( neutron star atmosphere or black body ) plus a hard power law with photon index in the 12 range .",
    "rutledge et al . (",
    "2001 ) reported that the 0.510 kev luminosity decreased by @xmath5 in the 5 yr between the asca and chandra observations .",
    "this variability can be attributed to the power - law component ; on the contrary temperature variations in the thermal component are limited to @xmath6 .",
    "short time variability was discovered by campana et al .",
    "( 1997 ) during a rosat hri pointing , with the source flux fading by a factor of @xmath7 on a timescale of @xmath8 days .",
    "extensive spectroscopic and photometric measurements of the optical counterpart in quiescence ( v=18.7 mag ) led to the determination of the orbital period ( 15.1 hr ; chevalier et al .",
    "1989 ; mcclintock & remillard 1990 ; cowley et al . 1988 ) and mass function ( @xmath9 , converting to a neutron star mass between @xmath10 ) . the optical spectrum shows the characteristics of a k5 - 7 main sequence star , contaminated by lines ( e.g. h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 and h@xmath13 ) and continuum emission probably resulting from an accretion disk ( shahbaz , naylor & charles 1993 ) .",
    "the latter was estimated to contribute @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the quiescent optical flux in the b , v , r and i bands , respectively .",
    "a short wavelength hst / fos spectrum of the quiescent optical counterpart yielded a 13502200  luminosity of @xmath18 .",
    "these results were confirmed by higher quality hst / stis spectra ( mcclintock & remillard 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , the uv spectrum appears to lie on the extrapolation of the power law component seen in x rays .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of an xmm - newton observation of cen x-4 to investigate , in much higher detail its quiescent state .",
    "we describe the observation characteristics and data filtering in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss on spectral and timing results .",
    "the interpretation of the data and discussion is presented in section 4 .",
    "our conclusions are in section 5 .",
    "the xmm - newton observatory ( jansen et al . 2001 ) comprises three @xmath19 @xmath20 effective area x  ray telescopes each with a european photon imaging camera ( epic , 0.115 kev ) at the focus .",
    "two of the epic imaging spectrometers use mos ccds ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ) and one uses pn ccds ( strder et al .",
    "2001 ) . reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs , 0.352.5 kev , den herder et al .",
    "2001 ) are located behind two of the telescopes .",
    "cen x-4 was observed on 2001 august 2021 .",
    "the epic cameras were operated in the prime full window mode with thin filters .",
    "we used the data generated by the pipeline processing subsystem in september 2001 .",
    "the observation is plagued by high background intervals due to soft proton flares .",
    "we excluded them using an intensity filter : all events accumulated in a time interval such that the rate , excluded the source region , exceeded 0.3 c s@xmath21 in the 1012 kev band for each of the two mos cameras and 0.8 c s@xmath21 for the pn camera were rejected .",
    "we adopted these thresholds , which are somewhat higher than the standard ones , motivated by the strength of our source ( @xmath22 c s@xmath21 in the 0.28 kev band of the pn , see below ) .",
    "we verified that results obtained by using standard thresholds are consistent with the cleaner ( but shorter ) exposures .",
    "we obtained net ( original ) exposure times of 32 ( 52 ) ks , 32 ( 52 ) ks , 24 ( 40 ) ks for mos1 , mos2 and pn , respectively .",
    "these represent the deepest observation of a neutron star sxrt ever carried out .",
    "rgs spectra were heavily affected by soft proton flares due to the dispersion over the field of view .",
    "optical monitor was not operated .",
    "for the pn , single and double pixel events were selected ( patterns 0 to 4 ) , for the mos , events corresponding to patterns from 0 to 12 were selected .",
    "source spectra were extracted from a circular region of @xmath23 for the two mos cameras and @xmath24 for pn camera , corresponding to an encircle energy fraction of @xmath25 .",
    "background spectra have been extracted from nearby circular regions @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the mos1 and mos2 , respectively . for the pn we considered two circular regions of @xmath24 and @xmath28 in the same ccd of the source . following the prescriptions of snowden et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we extracted the spectra ( including the flag=0 option ) obtaining 9609 counts ( 0.29 c s@xmath21 ) , 9829 counts ( 0.30 c s@xmath21 ) , 28673 counts ( 1.1 c s@xmath21 ) from the mos1 , mos2 and pn in the full band , respectively .",
    "note that pile up was negligible ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "response matrices and ancillary region files were generated with the sas ( v5.3.3 ) tasks rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "the spectral analysis was carried out in the 0.510 kev energy range for all the instruments using xspec ( v11.2 ) .",
    "all spectral uncertainties are given at @xmath30 confidence level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we first consider the total spectrum .",
    "we rebinned the mos and pn spectra so as to have 25 and 30 counts per spectral channel , respectively .",
    "we verified that the background spectra , especially at high energies , are not dominated by residual soft proton flares .",
    "in particular , pn and mos background spectra show the same behaviour and decrease by a factor of @xmath32 from 2 to 10 kev as expected for normal conditions ( lumb et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the spectrum can not be fit with any single component model .",
    "we then tried the canonical spectrum for sxrt in quiescence ( e.g. campana et al .",
    "1998b ; campana 2001 ) , i.e. an absorbed neutron star hydrogen atmosphere plus a power law ( we adopted the absorption model tbabs by wilms , allen & mccray 2000 and the neutron star atmosphere model by gnsicke , braje & romani 2002 ) .",
    "we included also a constant factor to account for the mismatch between the different epic instruments ( kirsch 2002 ) .",
    "this model provides a reduced @xmath33 for 518 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , corresponding to a null hypothesis probability ( n.h.p . ) of @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ spe ] ) .",
    "neutron star atmosphere models with iron or solar composition or a disk black body model provided worse fits with @xmath35 .",
    "a black body model formally provided a better fit to the data but with a null column density ( @xmath36 see table [ spetot ] ) .",
    "taking instead a column density of @xmath37 ( in line with expectations from optical data ) we obtained a worse fit ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed 0.510 kev flux of the power law plus neutron star atmosphere models is @xmath39 that at a distance of 1.2 kpc translates into a luminosity of @xmath40 . in the 0.510 kev band",
    "the atmosphere model accounts for @xmath41 of the total luminosity .      for timing analysis we considered the entire observation , including high background time intervals . besides source light curves , we extracted background light curves which we subtract ( including the error on the background rate ) from the source light curve .",
    "the resulting light curve is clearly not constant ( fig .",
    "[ curve ] ) .",
    "the importance of the background is in any case minimal apart from the minimum around 21.5 hr in fig .",
    "[ curve ] when the background reached @xmath42 of the cen x-4 rate .",
    "we extracted light curves in selected energy bands : 0.21 kev , 12 kev and 28 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ 3curve ] ) . a smaller amplitude of the variability at high energies is apparent .",
    "taking a bin time of 500 s ( in order to have a mean of 30 counts per bin in the 28 kev light curve ) we fit the light curves with a constant and we obtained @xmath43 in the three energy bands , respectively .",
    "possible flare - like events can be identified around 14 hr , 16.5 hr and 22.5 hr in fig .",
    "[ curve ] .",
    "rise times are about 20 min .",
    "a dip - like feature is also visible around 21.5 hr .",
    "we obtained a power spectrum of the entire observation by using the cleanest pn exposure .",
    "the power spectrum shows a strong noise component below @xmath44 hz ( i.e. a timescale longer than @xmath45 s ) , consistent with the variability discussed above .",
    "the rms variability amounts to @xmath46 in the @xmath2 hz band",
    ". the power spectrum can be well fit with a power law with index @xmath47 .",
    "no significant periodicities or quasi - periodic oscillations are seen .",
    "the power - law index of the x  ray power spectrum is consistent with the optical one which is characterized by an index of @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( hynes et al .",
    "2002 ; zurita et al .",
    "2003 ) .      to study possible spectral changes related to the variability we constructed the color - color diagram made by a soft color ( 12 kev / 0.21 kev ) versus a hard color ( 28 kev / 12 kev ,",
    "[ color ] ) .",
    "spectral variations are visible in the data .",
    "we plot in the same diagram the colors expected for single ( absorbed ) power law and neutron star atmosphere spectra for a set of parameters .",
    "as expected from the spectral analysis ( section 3.1 ) these single component models can not account for the data .",
    "in addition , we plot two lines with different column densities and different fractions of the two components models .",
    "we note that variations appear to be consistent with variations in the column density across the observation .",
    "alternatively a variation in the fraction of the power law flux to neutron star atmosphere flux can account for the observed variation .",
    "to check these hypotheses we carry out a more detailed spectral analysis .",
    "we concentrate on pn data , since these provide a factor of @xmath32 more counts than the two mos cameras together .",
    "we divided the data in the pn light curve ( 1,000 s bin ) at three different count rates : above 1.3 c s@xmath21 , between 1.0 and 1.3 c s@xmath21 and below 1.0 c s@xmath21 .",
    "we then fit the three corresponding spectra in order to search for possible differences .",
    "we consider the same absorbed power law plus neutron star atmosphere model .",
    "the same spectrum for the three count rate spectra is clearly not acceptable ( @xmath50 ) . letting the column density vary",
    "freely produces an improvement in the fit but not enough to make the fit acceptable ( @xmath51 ; the column density is smaller at larger count rates ) .",
    "this shows that the variability can not be fully ascribed to a column density variation .",
    "better results can be obtained allowing ( at least ) one of the spectral component to vary together with the column density ( table [ highbase ] ) . with an additional parameter we obtained better results ,",
    "however we can not decide on a statistical basis which of the two fits is better .",
    "no clear correlations are observable .",
    "the column density is within the errors for both these new fits . in the case of a variable neutron star atmosphere ,",
    "the temperature increases with the count rate , in the case of a variable power law , the power law photon index steepens as the count rate increases .",
    "the quiescent state of cen x-4 has been recognised to be variable both on long times scales ( @xmath52 in 5 yr , rutledge et al .",
    "2001 ) and on shorter timescales ( factor of @xmath7 in a few days , campana et al .",
    "1997 ) . during this xmm - newton observation",
    "x  ray variability has been observed ( at a level of @xmath53 rms ) on even shorter timescale ( down to @xmath45 s ) thanks to the large collecting area .",
    "variability on such a short timescale would have been missed if observed with any previous x  ray satellite .    in the pn light curve",
    "three flare - like events can be identified .",
    "ray flares have been observed in the transient black hole candidate v404 cyg also in quiescence ( wagner et al .",
    "1994 ; kong et al .",
    "flare activity has been recently reported also in the optical for a number of transient black holes during quiescence as well as for cen x-4 ( zurita , casares & shabhaz 2003 ; hynes et al .",
    "flares occur on timescales of minutes to a few hours , with no dependence on orbital phase .",
    "r - band luminosities are in the range @xmath54 .",
    "the mean duration of optical flares in cen x-4 is 21 min .",
    "this is similar to what observed in the x  rays .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for optical flares ( zurita et al .",
    "2003 ; hynes et al .",
    "chromospheric activity , instabilities in the mass transfer rate from the companion and viscous instabilities in an accretion disk have been ruled out for different reasons ( zurita et al .",
    "reprocessing of x  ray variations in the outer disk regions has also been considered less likely due to the large ratio between optical and x  ray emission ( zurita et al .",
    "2003 ) . in passing",
    ", we note that in the x  ray light curve three flare events can be identified ( see fig .",
    "[ curve ] ) . the durations and energetics of the first two flares are comparable : 0.9 and 1.2 hr and 1.8 and @xmath55 erg , respectively .",
    "the last flare is much shorter and less energetic ( 0.1 hr and @xmath56 erg ) .",
    "long term x  ray variability in the quiescent state of aql x-1 has also been reported based on chandra data . in particular , rutledge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that these variations can not be caused by variations in the power law only , but can be accounted for by a varying temperature of the neutron star atmosphere model .",
    "these variations are not monotonic but show first a decrease , then an increase and finally a decrease in time .",
    "this would rule out the deep crustal heating mechanism for sxrts in quiescence .",
    "campana & stella ( 2003 ) provided a different interpretation of these data ( plus an additional bepposax observations ) : a varying column density and power law component together with a stable neutron star atmosphere model .",
    "this latter model is motivated by the recent discovery of a millisecond radio pulsar psr j17405340 in the globular cluster ngc 6397 ( damico et al .",
    "2001 ; ferrario et al .",
    "this pulsar shows irregular eclipses in radio and it is also emitting in x ",
    "rays ( grindlay et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the x  ray emission is likely powered by the interaction of the relativistic wind of the radio pulsar with matter outflowing from the companion .",
    "this shock emission mechanism has also been put forward to explain the x  ray emission of the radio pulsar psr 125963 orbiting a be companion ( tavani & arons 1997 ) .",
    "this model is not disproved by the data .",
    "the power law photon index is between 1.5 and 2 as one would expect from simple modelling based synchrotron emission .",
    "the luminosity increases as the power law photon index increases as observed in psr 125963 for @xmath57 .",
    "we observed large ( @xmath53 ) r.m.s .",
    "x  ray variability in the quiescent state of cen x-4 .",
    "small spectral variations are observed as well .",
    "these can be mainly accounted for by a variation in the column density together with another spectral parameter .",
    "based on the available spectra we can not prefer a variation of the power law versus a variation in the temperature of the atmosphere component ( even if the first is slightly better in terms of reduced @xmath58 ) .",
    "this variability can be accounted for by accretion onto the neutron star surface ( e.g. rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ) or by the variable interaction between the pulsar relativistic wind and matter outflowing from the companion in a shock front ( e.g. campana & stella 2003 ) .",
