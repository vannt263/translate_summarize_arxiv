    "it is difficult to imagine a geometrical construction more fundamental than an embedded hypersurface across which the second fundamental form is discontinuous .",

    "the importance of such a construction is of course not limited to classical general relativity but is in a real sense central to a much wider class of considerations , such as brane world cosmologies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the stability of spherically symmetric thin shells , which are in a clearly defined sense  transparent \" , to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about static equilibrium under the assumption that the shells remain transparent under perturbation .",
    "the study of the stability of shells is not new @xcite . here",
    "we follow poisson and visser @xcite and parameterize the stability of equilibrium so that we do not have to specify a surface equation of state .",
    "the present work generalizes and systematizes previous studies and shows how the existence ( or not ) of a domain wall @xcite dominates the landscape of possible equilibrium configurations .",
    "we use the notation of musgrave and lake @xcite throughout and consider a 3-surface @xmath0 dividing spherically symmetric spacetime into two distinct parts . in the spherically symmetric case , in terms of the intrinsic",
    "coordinates @xmath1 , the metric intrinsic to @xmath0 can be given as @xmath2 where @xmath0 is timelike ( spacelike ) for @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the metric of a unit sphere . in terms of the surface energy density @xmath5 ,",

    "( our notation is explained in @xcite . )",
    "we have @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( in general not a constant ) is the ( invariantly defined @xcite ) effective gravitational mass of one of the enveloping spacetimes .",
    "the identity @xmath11 can be written in the form @xcite @xmath12}{m } \\right)^2     - \\frac{2 \\epsilon \\overline{m}}{r } +     \\left ( \\frac{m}{2r } \\right)^2.\\ ] ] we refer to ( [ eqn - lake ] ) as  the equation of motion \" for @xmath0 .",
    "this is a quadratic identity and applies to both shells and wormholes .      in this paper",
    "we use the transparency condition @xmath13=0 , \\label{transparency}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the ( 4-dimensional ) einstein tensor , @xmath15 is the 4-tangent to @xmath0 and @xmath16 the 4-normal to @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from ( [ transparency ] ) that for @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the intrinsic surface pressure .      in ( [ eqn - lake ] ) @xmath10 is defined in terms of coordinates extrinsic to @xmath0 . in order to view ( [ eqn - lake ] ) as defining the potential @xmath22 , where @xmath23 @xmath24 must define @xmath10 uniquely .",
    "this imposes a restriction on the enveloping spacetimes .",
    "consider , for example , bondi coordinates : @xmath25 the continuity of the intrinsic metric gives @xmath26 so that for ( [ potential ] ) to hold at equilibrium we require @xmath27 which , we note , is precisely the condition that guarantees ( [ transparency ] ) at equilibrium . for ( [ transparency ] ) to hold away from equilibrium",
    "it follows that @xmath28 . in the remainder of this work",
    "we assume ( [ mass ] ) and @xmath29 so that the shells remain transparent under perturbation . for timelike @xmath0",
    "then our assumptions require static embeddings in the neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we consider linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about static equilibrium .",
    "following poisson and visser @xcite , we use @xmath31 as a parameterization of the stability of equilibrium so that we do not have to specify an equation of state on @xmath0 .",
    "this parameterization singles out the case @xmath30 , equivalently @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "this case ( a  domain wall \" @xcite ) signals a fundamental change in the surfaces that distinguish stable equilibria parameterized by @xmath31 as it enters as an asymptote ( @xmath34 ) . whereas this limit has well known concrete manifestations , for example casimir and false vacua ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , it circumvents the usual phenomenology of @xmath0 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) since the surface stress - energy tensor of @xmath0 is simply proportional to the metric intrinsic to @xmath0 . in what follows we consider @xmath35 . whether or not this asymptote enters into a given configuration depends simply on the nature of the roots to the polynomial @xmath36 .",
    "phenomenologically , for timelike @xmath0 , @xmath31 represents the square of the speed of sound on @xmath0 and so one would normally expect @xmath37",
    ". however , one could also construct @xmath0 out of ( say ) fields for which @xmath31 need not even be positive . since we are concerned with stability , not phenomenology , the plots we give generally extend beyond @xmath37 .      from ( [ eqn - lake ] ) and ( [ potential ] )",
    "it follows that the equilibrium condition @xmath38 is @xmath39}{m}\\big(\\frac{[m]}{m}\\big)^ { ' } \\big\\ } \\equiv \\gamma , \\label{vprime}\\ ] ] and the stability condition @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42}{m}\\big(\\frac{[m]}{m}\\big)^{''}-\\big(\\frac{[m]}{m}\\big)^ { ' 2}. \\label{psi}\\ ] ] with the aide of the transparency condition ( [ transparency1 ] ) then the conditions for stable equilibria are @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 it is perhaps worthy of note that not only is there no need for the specification of an equation of state on @xmath0 , it is not necessary to even calculate @xmath21 .",
    "it is only necessary to calculate @xmath21 for a background check on the existence of the asymptote @xmath30 by way of a search for allowed roots to the polynomial @xmath46 .",
    "in the following examples the explicit form of @xmath47 can become lengthy .",
    "we find it instructive to demonstrate the possible equilibrium configurations graphically . in the approach we have used , the appearance ( or not ) of the asymptote @xmath30 dominates the landscape of possible equilibrium configurations .",
    "the polynomial @xmath48 is given in appendix a.      poisson and visser @xcite have considered the stability of schwarzschild wormholes ( @xmath49 ) . in our notation",
    "they consider the case @xmath50=0 , \\qquad \\epsilon=-1 , \\qquad m=-2r\\sqrt{1 - 2\\frac{m}{r } } \\label{wormhole}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a constant .",
    "it follows that @xmath47 takes a particularly simple form : @xmath51 equations ( [ posupsilon ] ) , ( [ negupsilon1 ] ) and ( [ wormhole1 ] ) reproduce their calculation .",
    "physical units associated with this case are given in appendix b. the situation is generalized in figure 1 where we have not assumed the continuity of @xmath10 .",
    "for this example @xmath52 and @xmath53 so that the region _ above _ the surface _",
    "( a ) _ and _ below _ the surface _ ( b ) _ in figure 1 correspond to stable equilibrium .",
    "brady , louko and poisson @xcite have considered the stability of a shell surrounding a classical schwarzschild black hole and have shown that stability conditions supersede the energy conditions for this configuration as considered previously by frauendiener , hoenselaers and konrad @xcite . in this case @xmath54 where we have labelled @xmath55",
    "_ exterior _ to the shell in the sense that the event horizon is in @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 and @xmath58 are @xmath59 it follows that the region _ below _ the surface shown in figure 2 corresponds to stable equilibrium .",
    "we find that @xmath60 as @xmath61 and that @xmath62 as @xmath63 so that @xmath64 in agreement with previous results .",
    "there is no asymptote @xmath30 in this case .      in what follows",
    "we explore the physical consequences of including a cosmological constant ( @xmath65 ) in the background .",
    "the only spacetimes we consider here are the schwarzschild -de sitter and schwarzschild - anti de sitter spaces so that the effective gravitational mass @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant .",
    "qualitatively , the inclusion of a positive cosmological constant inside a timelike shell should weaken the binding of the shell in the sense that @xmath21 will become negative ( a surface _ tension _ ) to stablize the shell at sufficiently large @xmath24 .",
    "the result is quite unlike the case @xmath70 ( above ) were surface tensions are not required to stablize the shell at any radius .",
    "this effect is demonstrated in figure 3 . in this case @xmath71 where again we have labelled @xmath55 _ exterior _ to the shell in the sense that the innermost event horizon is in @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 and @xmath58 are @xmath59 in this case , it follows that the region _ below _",
    "the surface shown in figure 3 corresponds to stable equilibrium .",
    "there is no asymptote @xmath30 in this case .",
    "this case is the same as the previous one except that @xmath72 .",
    "qualitatively , the inclusion of a negative cosmological constant inside a timelike shell should not _ require _ a surface tension to stablize the shell at sufficiently large @xmath24 . whereas this agrees with what we find ( see figure 4 ) ,",
    "in this case we find an asymptote @xmath30 with the consequence that the stability surfaces resemble the wormhole case .",
    "however , since @xmath73 here , the regions of stability are the reverse of those for wormholes in agreement with our intuition .      by the inversion of @xmath74 we mean @xmath75 with @xmath76 and where again we have labelled @xmath55 _ exterior _ to the shell in the sense that the innermost event horizon is in @xmath56 . in this case",
    "we find that the stability regions are qualitatively similar to figure 4 .",
    "the inverse of @xmath77 is the same situation with @xmath78 and in this case we find that the stability regions are qualitatively similar to figure 3 in agreement with intuition .",
    "one would not expect that the inclusion of @xmath65 _ continuous _ across @xmath0 would change , in a significant way , possible equilibrium configurations . to test this consider @xmath79 where again we have labelled @xmath55 _ exterior _ to the shell in the sense that the innermost event horizon is in @xmath56 .",
    "our findings are summarized in figure 5 which , when compared to figure 2 , agrees with what we would expect .",
    "in this paper we have examined the stability of transparent spherically symmetric thin shells to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about static equilibrium under the assumption that the shells remain transparent under perturbation .",
    "our approach has followed that due to poisson and visser @xcite wherein @xmath31 is used as a parameterization of the stability of equilibrium .",
    "an equation of state on @xmath0 is not specified .",
    "the present work generalizes and systematizes previous studies . we have found that the single feature which dominates the landscape of equilibrium configurations is the appearance or not of the asymptote @xmath30 .",
    "the cosmological constant has been included in our calculations with results in agreement with intuition .",
