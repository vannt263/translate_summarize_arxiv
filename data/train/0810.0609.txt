    "at present , the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been scrutinized relentlessly from its inception and held its ground over the entire breadth of its theoretical reach almost without failure . in spite of its impressive successes , the sm is not completely satisfactory as the theory of elementary particles from the view point of both aesthetics and phenomenology .",
    "it has been realized that bottom quark physics is a powerful probe of physics beyond the sm in a complementary way to the direct searches , which is crucial to identify the new physics ( np ) and its properties correctly as well as understand its theoretical consequences .",
    "rare decays involving @xmath6 flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) , which are forbidden at the tree level in the sm , can provide an ideal platform to test the sm precisely as well as bound its extensions stringently so that pave the way for the establishment of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "wealthy experimental data on both inclusive and exclusive @xmath6 fcnc @xmath7 meson decays @xcite have been accumulated at the @xmath8 factories operating at the peak of @xmath9 , which also motivated intensive theoretical studies on these mesonic decay modes .",
    "unlike mesonic decays , the investigations of fcnc @xmath6 transition for bottom baryonic decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite are much behind because more degrees of freedom are involved in the bound state of baryon system at the quark level .",
    "it should be pointed out that such baryonic decays can offer the unique ground to extract the helicity structure of effective hamiltonian for fcnc @xmath6 transition in the sm and beyond , since the information on the handness of the quark is lost in the hadronization of meson case .",
    "compared with the @xmath7 meson decays , @xmath5 baryon decays contain some particular observables involving the spin of @xmath10 quark , which are sensitive to the new physics and more easily detectable . from the viewpoint of experiment , the only drawback of bottom baryon decays is that the production rate of @xmath5 baryon in @xmath10 quark hadronization is about four times less than that of @xmath7 meson , hence we need more experimental data on heavy quark decays from future colliders , such as large hadron colliders ( lhc ) at cern , and tevatron collider at fnal , to perform a stringent constraint on the parameter space of available new physics models .    among various models of physics beyond the sm ,",
    "the models with extra dimensions @xcite are of intensive interest , since they provide a unified framework for gravity and other interactions , which can give some hints of the hierarchy problem and a connection with string theory . among the extra dimension models ,",
    "the models of particular interests are the scenarios with universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , which are the most democratic extra dimension model in the scene that all sm fields are allowed to propagate in the extra dimension . above the compactification scale @xmath11 ,",
    "a given ued model becomes a higher dimensional field theory whose equivalent description in four dimensions consists of the sm fields , the tower of their kaluza - klein ( kk ) partners and additional tower of kk modes without corresponding sm partners .",
    "a simple scenario is represented by the applequist - cheng - dobrescu ( acd ) model @xcite with a single compactified extra dimension , which introduces only one additional free parameter relative to the sm , i.e. @xmath11 , the inverse of the compactification radius . as all particles can access the bulk , momentum along the fifth dimension , and hence the kk number",
    "is conserved in any process , which can break down to the conservation of kk - parity , defined as @xmath12 due to the orbifold corrections .",
    "different bounds to the size of extra dimension have been explored in various processes already accessible at particle accelators or within the reach of future facilities .",
    "the analysis on the tevatron run i data allows to establish the bound @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "analysis of the anomalous magnetic moment @xcite and the @xmath14 vertex @xcite also gives rise to the bound @xmath15 .",
    "the conservation of kk parity implies the absence of tree level kk contributions to low energy processes taking place at scales @xmath16 .",
    "the fact that kk excitations can influence processes occurring at loop level also indicates that @xmath6 fcnc transitions are extremely important for constraining the extra dimension model .",
    "for this reason , the effective hamiltonian responsible for @xmath6 transitions was derived in @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 mass difference , the parameter @xmath18 , @xmath19 mixing mass differences @xmath20 , rare decays of @xmath21 and @xmath7 meson as well as cp - violating ratio @xmath22 are also comprehensively studied there .",
    "in particular , it is found that @xmath23 allows to constrain @xmath24 @xcite , which has been updated by a more recent analysis in combination with the nnlo values of wilson coefficient in the sm and new experimental data to @xmath25 at 95% c.l .",
    "exclusive @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 decays of @xmath7 meson @xcite together with @xmath29 and @xmath30 decays of @xmath31 meson @xcite are also studied in the framework of the ued scenario .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 and @xmath32 decays in the ued model are further investigated in @xcite employing the form factors calculated in the three - point qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) within the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of branching ratio , forward - backward asymmetry and polarization asymmetry of lepton for semileptonic decay of @xmath33 to the compactification parameter @xmath11 are analyzed in @xcite using the transition form factors given by the qcdsr at length . in this work , we would like to revisit @xmath0 and @xmath34 decays in the acd model with the form factors derived in the light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite , where the effects of higher twist distribution amplitudes of @xmath2 baryon are included .",
    "in particular , we consider how the polarization asymmetry of @xmath2 baryon in @xmath1 decays can be used to constrain the radius of extra dimension , which are still not available in the literature .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows : after a brief introduction to the acd model in section ii , we present the effective hamiltonian for @xmath6 transition and parameterizations of transition form factors in section iii .",
    "the dependence of branching ratio , forward - backward asymmetry and polarization asymmetry of @xmath2 baryon in @xmath1 decays on the radius of extra dimension @xmath3 are given in section iv , where the sensitivity of branching fraction of @xmath0 on the compactification parameter @xmath3 is also presented .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in our usual universe we have 3 spatial plus 1 temporal dimensions and if an extra dimension exists and is compactified , fields living in all dimensions would manifest themselves in the @xmath35 space by the appearance of kk excitations .",
    "the most pertinent question is whether ordinary fields propagate or not in all extra dimensions .",
    "one obvious possibility is the propagation of gravity in whole ordinary plus extra dimensional universe , the `` bulk '' .",
    "contrary to this there are models with ued in which all the fields propagate in all available dimensions @xcite and acd model belongs to one of ued scenarios @xcite    this model is the minimal extension of the sm in @xmath36 dimensions , and in literature a simple case @xmath37 is considered @xcite .",
    "the topology for this extra dimension is orbifold @xmath38 , and the coordinate @xmath39 runs from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , where @xmath3 is the compactification radius .",
    "the kk mode expansion of the fields are determined from the boundary conditions at two fixed points @xmath42 and @xmath43 on the orbifold . under parity transformation",
    "@xmath44 @xmath45 the fields may be even or odd .",
    "even fields have their correspondent in the @xmath46-dimensional sm and their zero mode in the kk mode expansion can be interpreted as the ordinary sm field .",
    "the odd fields do not have their correspondent in the sm and therefore do not have zero mode in the kk expansion .",
    "the salient features of the acd model are :    * the compactification radius @xmath3 is the only free parameter with respect to sm * no tree level contribution of kk modes in low energy processes ( at scale @xmath16 ) and no production of single kk excitation in ordinary particle interactions are the consequences of the conservation of kk parity .",

    "* yukawa terms *    in sm , yukawa coupling of the higgs field to the fermion provides the fermion mass terms .",

    "can not be simultaneously even under @xmath80 .",
