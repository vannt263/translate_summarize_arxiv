    "recently [ 5 ] , we considered the coupling between the horizontal ( @xmath1 ) and vertical ( off - plane , @xmath2 ) degrees of freedom in a dust mono - layer ; a set of nonlinear equations for longitudinal and transverse dust lattice waves ( ldlws , tdlws ) was thus rigorously derived [ 5 ] . here , we review the nonlinear dust grain excitations which may occur in a dp crystal ( here assumed quasi - one - dimensional and infinite , composed from identical grains , of equilibrium charge @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 , located at @xmath5  @xmath6 ) .",
