    "numerical simulations have become one of the most important theoretical tools for exploring the complicated problem of galaxy formation .",
    "modern numerical work on galaxy formation was initiated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who included radiative cooling by hydrogen and helium , and attempted to account for star formation and feedback processes .",
    "subsequent work employed more sophisticated treatments of supernova feedback @xcite , models for chemical enrichment @xcite , and methods to ` zoom in ' on galaxies of interest within cosmological simulations @xcite    while these studies achieved limited success in creating rotationally supported disks , the simulated galaxies typically failed to reproduce their observed counterparts . in general , the simulated disks were found to be too small and were more centrally concentrated than actual galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , the star formation in the models was overly efficient , converting too large a fraction of the gas into stars by the present day @xcite .",
    "many of the shortcomings of the early modeling can be tied to the coarse resolution of the simulations and the manner in which feedback was treated . in a cosmological context , the multiphase structure of the ism within galaxies can not be resolved in detail , so star - forming gas is generally described as a single - phase medium .",
    "if feedback energy is deposited into this gas purely as thermal energy , it will be quickly radiated away , and any impact of feedback from star formation will be lost .",
    "in addition , if star formation is very efficient in low mass halos at high redshifts , a large number of dense , compact galaxies will form and eventually be incorporated into the inner regions of larger galaxies through hierarchical merging .",
    "if these baryonic clumps lose angular momentum to dark halos , the resulting objects will be smaller in extent than if the baryons had been accreted smoothly .",
    "thus , an early collapse of baryons opens a channel for gas to lose angular momentum , yielding galaxies that are too compact , lack angular momentum , and produce stars overly efficiently compared with observations .",
    "subsequent work attempted to alleviate these shortcomings by employing stronger forms of feedback and modifications to the cosmological framework . in some cases ,",
    "the problems noted above were exacerbated .",
    "for example , photoheating by a diffuse ultraviolet ( uv ) background was found to further reduce the angular momentum content of the simulated galaxies @xcite .",
    "other efforts included the impact of preheating and gas blow - out from small halos @xcite and the formation of galaxies in a warm dark matter ( wdm ) cosmology @xcite .",
    "more direct comparisons to observations were made possible by incorporating spectral synthesis techniques into the modeling @xcite and by using the tully - fisher relation to constrain the hierarchical origin of galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the galaxies in these simulations were still too concentrated .",
    "the most recent studies of disk formation have yielded somewhat more promising results . using a model of self - propagating star formation combined with supernova feedback and a uv background ,",
    "@xcite produced disk galaxies deficient in angular momentum by less than an order of magnitude .",
    "@xcite report the formation of realistic disk galaxies in @xmath0cdm and @xmath0wdm cosmologies using simulations that include standard prescriptions for cooling , a uv background , and star formation .",
    "@xcite present detailed analyses of simulated galaxies with kinematic and photometric properties similar to observed sab galaxies .",
    "although the various attempts to simulate disk formation have provided some impressive successes , the essential physics behind this process remains unclear .",
    "@xcite claim that the low angular momentum of simulated galaxies in previous works owed at least partly to inadequate resolution .",
    "in addition , they emphasize the impact that the matter power spectrum can have on galaxy formation through simulations of wdm universes in which the bulge and spheroid components of galaxies are smaller than in cdm models .",
    "these findings are supported by @xcite and @xcite , whose calculations indicate that high resolution , strong stellar feedback , and warm dark matter can produce realistic disk galaxies .",
    "finally , @xcite suggest that a crucial ingredient for forming proper disks is an implementation of feedback that can regulate star formation .    here",
    ", we use a ` multiphase model ' to describe star - forming gas , in which the ism consists of cold clouds in pressure equilibrium with an ambient hot phase @xcite .",
    "radiative cooling of gas leads to the growth of clouds , which in turn host the material that fuels star formation .",
    "the supernovae associated with star formation provide feedback by heating the ambient medium and evaporating cold clouds .",
    "the feedback treatment establishes a self - regulated cycle for star formation , pressurizing the star - forming gas .",
    "implemented in a subresolution manner , our approach makes it possible to obtain numerically converged results for the star formation rate at moderate resolution .",
    "this feature is particularly important for simulations of cdm cosmologies , where early generations of galaxies may be difficult to resolve .    using this model of star - forming gas",
    ", @xcite obtained a converged prediction for the history of cosmic star formation that agrees well with observations at redshifts @xmath15 @xcite . in subsequent work",
    ", @xcite showed that this model also accounts for the observed abundance and star formation rates of damped lyman - alpha absorbers and lyman - break galaxies at @xmath16 .",
    "in what follows , we study the consequences of our multiphase model for the ism on the formation of disk galaxies .",
    "first , we employ a high - resolution simulation to identify realistic disk galaxies in a cosmological context .",
    "for one such disk galaxy , we examine its kinematic and photometric properties in detail , demonstrating good agreement with observations of local spirals .",
    "second , we use a set of idealized simulations to study disk formation in individual dark matter halos to isolate the effect of different models for the equation of state of the ism .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that the feedback in our multiphase model alters the dynamics by pressurizing the star - forming gas and stabilizing forming disks against fragmentation .",
    "we emphasize that this aspect of our modeling does not depend on the details of our prescription for star formation and feedback , but is determined by the effective equation of state for star - forming gas .",
    "thus , our conclusions should obtain generally , provided that the actual bulk equation of state for the ism has characteristics similar to those of our description .    in   [ sec :",
    "sim : cosmo ] , we present our simulation method .",
    "we review our analysis procedure in   [",

    "is selected as a high resolution region where we replace the lrdm particles with particles of eight - times lower mass .",
    "the initial displacement field is then calculated following a standard `` zooming '' procedure @xcite , where small scale perturbations are added appropriately in the high - resolution region .",
    "note that the high - resolution zone does not target a particular object , with the intent of eliminating bias that could be introduced by selecting halos that may be intrinsically favorable for disk galaxy formation .",
    "we further split the high - resolution particles into dark matter ( hrdm ) and gas .",
    "the resulting particle masses of each component are then @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "we set the gravitational softening length for the high - resolution particles to 0.65 comoving @xmath25kpc . while our 10 @xmath25 mpc box is too small to be fully representative of the @xmath30 universe ,",
    "the volume is sufficient for our purposes as our current work does not concern , for example , large - scale correlations of galaxies or the global mass function . here , we are interested only in individual , galactic - sized objects which are mostly unaffected by the simulation box size .",
    "we include a uv background and radiative cooling and heating in the manner of @xcite and @xcite , as well as star formation , supernova feedback , and metal enrichment .",
    "we employ the multiphase model developed by @xcite to describe the star - forming gas ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our approach accounts for some of the key aspects of the multiphase structure of the ism @xcite without spatially resolving the different phases explicitly . instead",
    ", a statistical mixture of the phases is computed analytically , taking into account the growth of cold clouds embedded in a supernova - heated ambient phase , the formation of stars out of the cloud material , and the evaporation of clouds in supernova remnants .",
    "our strategy is motivated by two basic limitations in modeling star formation on cosmological scales .",
    "first , there is no fundamental theory of this process .",
    "second , large - scale simulations lack the resolution that would be required to characterize the ism in detail .",
    "our statistical method decouples our ignorance of star formation from its impact on galactic scales , by coarse - graining the physics of star - forming gas . in principle , this strategy could be applied to any model of star formation .",
    "-1 mm -3 mm    for a detailed description of our multiphase model we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "for definiteness , we list in table 1 the parameter values adopted in our simulations .",
    "the parameters include the efficiency of the evaporation process @xmath31 , the mass fraction of stars that are short - lived and die as supernovae @xmath32 , the cold gas cloud temperature @xmath33 , the effective supernova temperature @xmath34 , and the gas consumption time - scale @xmath35 .",
    "as @xcite argue , all of these aside from one , e.g. @xmath35 , can be constrained by simple physical arguments .",

    "* ) .    on the surface ,",
    "our description of star - forming gas appears complicated , with the properties of the different phases described by differential equations that include the various processes listed above .",
    "however , in the end , our model can be reduced to two main ingredients that make our results easier to interpret .",
    "@xcite showed that the star - forming gas quickly establishes a self - regulated cycle in which the mass and energy of the phases can be approximated by equilibrium solutions . in this limit",
    ", the impact of star formation and feedback can be reduced to : 1 ) the rate at which gas is converted into stars , and 2 ) the effective equation of state for star - forming gas .    here , as in @xcite , we choose to parameterize the star formation rate by @xmath36 where @xmath37 the free parameter @xmath35 is chosen to match the kennicutt law",
    ", @xmath38 is a threshold density above which gas is subject to thermal instability and star formation , and @xmath39 is the density of clouds which , in equilibrium , is given by equation ( 18 ) of @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath38 can be fixed by e.g.  requiring the equation of state to be continuous .    in our subresolution model , feedback from supernovae",
    "adds thermal energy to the ism , pressurizing it and modifying its equation of state . on the scales relevant to the dynamics of the gas ,",
    "this is described by an effective equation of state , which can be written @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath42 is the total gas density , and @xmath43 is the effective specific thermal energy of the star - forming gas which , in equilibrium , is given by equation ( 19 ) of @xcite .",

    "this choice ensures that the effective pressure is a continuous function of density . for the equation of state shown in figure 1 ,",
    "a different value of @xmath49 would introduce an unphysical jump in pressure at the transition density where the gas is no longer isothermal .",

    "the metallicity gradients of the star - forming gas and recently formed stars in the disk then track each other , again highlighting the strong metallicity gradient in the gaseous disk .",

    ", we find our galaxy to be in good agreement with the average observed @xmath4-band magnitude of @xmath139 for galaxies with @xmath140 .",
    "the formation of a well - defined disk galaxy without a dominant bulge can be viewed as a significant success towards obtaining realistic galaxies in cosmological simulations .",
    "it is therefore of particular interest to understand which aspects of our modeling are mainly responsible for this outcome .",
    "a novel feature of our approach lies in our use of a subresolution model for the multiphase structure of the ism , together with an effective equation of state that this model implies for the dense star - forming gas .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : eos ] , when the gas is sufficiently dense to be thermally unstable and subject to star formation , the equation of state departs from that of an isothermal gas , and becomes stiffer with increasing density",
    ". this will affect the bulk hydrodynamics of the gas , through the pressure gradient term in the euler equation .",
    "consequently , dense gaseous disks will experience additional pressure support from supernova feedback , in a manner that is different from previous attempts to model galaxy formation .    in order to examine the importance of this effect",
    "further , we use a set of simulations to consider disks forming in isolated halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where we vary the description of star - forming gas and associated feedback effects .",
    "these results show that the physics of dense , star - forming gas has a substantial impact on the dynamics of disks , indicating that the model of the ism plays a crucial role in our successful formation of a disk galaxy in a cosmological context .      in order to isolate the dependence of disk formation on the physics of the ism",
    ", we investigate the dynamics of gas in static spherically symmetric nfw @xcite dark matter halos of mass @xmath141 @xmath142 and concentration @xmath143 .",
    "we place @xmath144 gas particles that initially trace the dark matter in these halos and set the initial temperature profile such that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium when evolved with non - radiative hydrodynamics .",
    "we add angular momentum to the gas , corresponding to a relatively high spin parameter of @xmath145 .",
    "we then evolve the gas forward in time including radiative cooling . under these conditions , we expect the gas to collapse smoothly into a thin , rotationally supported disk .",
    "we do not intend for this to be a realistic model of disk formation in a hierarchical universe , but the idealized nature of the simulations described below makes it possible to examine the consequences of varying the gas physics in detail .",
    "this set - up provides initial conditions for a suite of simulations , where we consider three different descriptions of the ism . the first model , which we will refer to as `` justcool , '' consists of simply allowing the gas to cool with primordial abundances without allowing for any star formation or feedback .",
    "the `` justcool '' scenario serves as an extreme reference case where star formation and feedback can not affect the gas dynamics .",
    "since the dense gas that settles into a disk can cool efficiently , its temperature will remain close to @xmath146 k , effectively obeying an isothermal equation of state .",
    "our second description of the ism , which we refer to as `` iso - ism , '' includes gas cooling and star formation , according to equation  ( [ eq : sfr ] ) , but no feedback effects .",
    "gas in the disk again obeys a nearly isothermal equation of state in this case , but compared to our `` justcool '' model , dense gas is converted into collisionless star particles . for ease of comparison , we use the same star formation rate for gas of a given density as in our multiphase model .    finally , our third description of the ism is the @xcite multiphase ism model , which includes radiative cooling , star formation , and supernova feedback in the form of thermal energy input and cloud evaporation , as described earlier .",
    "we refer to this model as the `` multiphase - ism '' model .",
    "the primary difference between the `` multiphase - ism '' and `` iso - ism '' scenarios is that in the multiphase model feedback from supernovae modifies the effective equation of state of star - forming gas , providing increased pressure support , as indicated by figure [ fig : eos ] .",
    "the stiffer equation of state helps to regulate star formation so that it occurs at a rate consistent with observations of isolated disk galaxies @xcite once the free parameter @xmath35 of the model is properly adjusted ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for each ism model",
    ", we ran a number of simulations , varying the numerical integration parameters to test the robustness of the results .",
    "in particular , we varied the number of sph neighbors and the value of the time - step taken by the code .",
    "none of these choices had a significant effect on the outcome .",
    "therefore , our results appear to have converged with respect to time integration . when the number of sph neighbors is varied , instabilities in the disks tend to occur at slightly different times and locations , but the qualitative behavior of the simulations remains unchanged .",
    "the time evolution of simulations with our three ism models reveals interesting differences . in figure",
    "[ fig : d4:iso - ism ] , we show the stellar mass distribution , adaptively smoothed and seen edge- and face - on , for the `` iso - ism '' model at ( clockwise from upper left ) @xmath147 gyr , @xmath148 gyr , @xmath149 gyr , and @xmath150 gyr .",
    "gas in the inner parts of the halo quickly cools to roughly @xmath146 k , settles into a thin , rotationally supported disk , and forms stars .",
    "the @xmath146 k gas in the disk is highly compressible , obeying a nearly isothermal equation of state .",
    "consequently , the self - gravitating gaseous disk becomes gravitationally unstable as soon as it reaches a moderate surface density .",
    "the @xcite instability quickly causes a fragmentation of the smooth gas disk into clumps , which collapse further under their own self - gravity and form stars on a short time - scale . as the galaxy ages , the stellar clumps coalesce through dynamical friction into ever larger lumps , destroying the disk . by @xmath151 ,",
    "the stars are mainly confined in two large blobs , with numerous smaller clumps orbiting the center .",
    "the evolution of the galaxy in the `` iso - ism '' model contrasts sharply with that in the corresponding `` multiphase - ism '' run .",
    "we illustrate this in in figure  [ fig : d4:multiphase - ism ] .",
    "again , the gas cools into a thin , star - forming disk .",
    "however , supernova feedback regulates the rate of star formation and the dynamics of the dense star - forming gas . owing to feedback ,",
    "the ism is pressurized , stabilizing the gas against the toomre instability .",
    "consequently , a smooth distribution of gas is maintained in the plane of the disk and stars form steadily , increasing the size of the disk from @xmath152 at @xmath147 gyr to @xmath153 at @xmath154 . since the gas remains stable and does not fragment into clumps , the disk largely avoids angular momentum loss and the simulation yields a large disk galaxy with only a modest bulge .",
    "-1 mm -5 mm    in figure [ fig:3ismz0 ] , we compare the gas mass distributions in the `` justcool '' ( left ) , `` iso - ism '' ( center ) , and `` multiphase - ism '' ( right ) simulations at @xmath148 gyr . both the `` justcool '' and `` iso - ism '' models produce clumpy gas disks that fragmented by the toomre instability .",
    "in fact , the time evolution of the `` justcool '' and `` iso - ism '' models is very similar , except that in the former case the instabilities occur earlier , showing that star formation can have a stabilizing effect by reducing the gas surface density .",
    "note , however , that only the `` multiphase - ism '' model produces a gaseous disk that exhibits long - term stability .    in summary ,",
    "our simulations of the formation of disks in isolated halos clearly show that the modeling of the ism has a strong effect on disk stability .",
    "in particular , an isothermal equation of state for star - forming gas produces gaseous disks that are violently unstable . under these conditions",
    "it would be difficult if not impossible to form large , extended disk galaxies unless the gas surface density is always kept extremely low , for example by adopting an unrealistically short star formation time - scale that would conflict with the observed kennicutt law .",
    "in contrast , the multiphase model for the ism yields disk galaxies that are more stable .",
    "the stiffer equation of state produces disks that are more resilient against toomre instability than in models with an effectively isothermal ism .",
    "fragmentation is avoided , enabling the steady formation of large stellar disks even when the disk is gas - rich and has a high gaseous surface density .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the behavior of the equation of state in our multiphase description of the ism is the primary reason why our cosmological simulation can produce disk galaxies with negligible bulge components",
    ". this conclusion should be insensitive to the detailed features of our multiphase model of the ism , provided that the actual equation of state for star - forming gas behaves similarly to the one proposed by @xcite .",
    "we have performed a high - resolution cosmological simulation that included gas dynamics , radiative heating and cooling , and star formation and supernova feedback , modeled in the framework of a subresolution description of a multiphase ism .",
    "inspecting the ten largest halos , we identified a well - resolved disk galaxy at redshift @xmath30 .",
    "the disk galaxy has realistic photometric properties , including a reasonable central surface brightness and exhibits good agreement with the @xmath4-band tully - fisher relation .",
    "most important , this object is the first published example of a disk galaxy from a simulation that features a simple exponential surface brightness profile without having a large bulge component .",
    "our work demonstrates that extended disk galaxies can form in a @xmath0cdm cosmology within full hydrodynamic simulations , an important step forward in understanding the origin of disk galaxies .    while the total angular momentum of the stellar component of the disk galaxy is appropriate for observed galaxies with similar rotation velocities , the inner regions of the galaxy have low specific stellar angular momentum .",
    "it is not clear whether this is a problem with the physics , e.g.  excessive angular momentum loss by the gas , or is at least partly an artifact of our inability to completely resolve the thin stellar disk .",
    "the disk galaxy in our simulation does not have an obvious problem with its radial size , but statistical studies with samples of simulated disk galaxies will be needed to settle this question .",
    "however , we find the success achieved here encouraging and suggest that the problem with disk size is alleviated by employing equations of state for star - forming gas that are stiffer than isothermal .    using a suite of isolated galaxy formation simulations , we have explicitly demonstrated the consequences our treatment for the ism has on the formation of disk galaxies .",
    "simulations with an effectively isothermal ism yield gravitationally unstable disks and fail to produce large , smooth stellar disks .",
    "in contrast , the multiphase model supplies enough pressure support to the star - forming gas to prevent catastrophic toomre instability , allowing stable galactic disks to form .",
    "we have also verified that these conclusions do not depend on details of our numerical integration .",
    "our work differs in a number of respects from earlier numerical attempts to study disk galaxy formation .",
    "we have used a novel formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics that , by construction , conserves both energy and entropy simultaneously , even when smoothing lengths vary in response to changes in density @xcite . while we consider it unlikely that previous numerical work on galaxy formation with sph was strongly affected by inaccuracies in e.g.  entropy conservation , it is clearly preferable to use a fully conservative scheme that mitigates against any numerical `` overcooling . ''",
    "more important , we have formulated the consequences of feedback using a subresolution model for star formation in a multiphase ism . in this scheme",
    ", the local supernova feedback modifies the effective equation of state for star - forming gas , leading to an efficient self - regulation of star formation and a stabilizing effect on highly overdense gas .",
    "this aspect of our modeling feeds directly into the dynamics of forming disks by modifying the pressure gradient term in the hydrodynamic equations of motion .",
    "our formulation of the ism physics has a number of advantages over earlier treatments of star formation and feedback .",
    "other workers have implemented techniques to allow feedback to have a significant dynamical impact by , e.g.  depositing thermal energy into gas surrounding star - forming regions and artificially delaying the radiative loss of this energy by the gas for an ad hoc time interval .",
    "while similar in spirit to our method , these approaches make the comparison of results from different calculations challenging because the consequences of feedback are difficult to summarize in a concise , quantitative form .",
    "when expressed in terms of an effective equation of state , as done here , the dynamical implications of feedback become easier to interpret .",
    "a discussion in terms of the effective equation of state is also relatively insensitive to the detailed physics responsible for pressurizing the gas , and enables one to relate the description of feedback to observations of the ism .    in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of galaxy formation to the physics of star - forming gas",
    ", we employed a simple multiphase model of the ism @xcite , where the gas is imagined to be thermally unstable at sufficiently high densities and exists in two distinct phases , in pressure equilibrium . in detail , it is not plausible that this is a true picture of the ism of disk galaxies , because this model ignores , e.g.  turbulent motion , magnetic fields , and cosmic rays .",
    "however , we believe that the basic points of our modeling do not depend on these complications .",
    "the evolution of the different models shown in   [ sec : sim : halo : intro ] depends mainly on the effective equation of state for the star - forming gas on scales which characterize the toomre instability . according to the toomre criterion",
    ", a thin sheet of gas in differential rotation will be gravitationally unstable if @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the sound speed , @xmath157 is the epicyclic frequency , and @xmath158 is the surface density . in terms of an effective temperature of the gas , @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are values characteristic of the milky way in the solar neighborhood , and @xmath162 . if the gas obeyed an isothermal equation of state with @xmath163 , then @xmath164 , and the disk would be violently unstable , as for example in the case of our `` iso - ism '' simulations described in   6 . with our equation of state , however , the effective temperature at densities characteristic of a forming galaxy would be @xmath165 ( see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so @xmath166 and the disk would be stable , explaining why our `` multiphase - ism '' models in   6 produce realistic disks .",
    "moreover , for thin disks of gas , the fastest growing unstable mode has a wavelength which is a significant fraction of the disk size ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , therefore , the growth of the instability is sensitive only to the macroscopic equation of state for the ism .",
    "whether or not the effective equation of state we have adopted ( i.e.  figure  [ fig : eos ] ) for the ism is appropriate in detail is uncertain , but this question is largely independent of the exact properties of star - forming gas . in particular , we expect our results to generalize to other models for the ism with similar effective equations of state .",
    "having identified one exponential disk galaxy in our simulation , future work is needed to extend our analysis to other galaxies .",
    "for example , a good statistical sample of simulated disks is needed before we can characterize the distribution of disk sizes and their morphological types , as well as the photometric and kinematic properties of the galaxies .",
    "this work will require larger simulations of substantial dynamic range in order to obtain adequate numbers of simulated disk galaxies , but we find the initial successes described here and recently by other authors highly encouraging . a comparison with the wealth of observational data on the structural parameters of galaxies in the local universe",
