    "the phase plane of such a map is , generally , very complex and consists of intimately entangled domains filled by regular and chaotic trajectories .",
    "the chaotic domains remain isolated from each other if the driven force is weak , but they join and global chaos appears when the strength of the force exceeds some critical value . after that",
    ", regular motion survives only inside isolated islands of the phase plane , where phase oscillations near the points of mainly low order non - linear resonances take place , whose areas diminish with the strength growing .    existence of the chaotic domains signifies absence of a global analytical integral of the motion . at the same time , there exist in the regions of the regular motion approximate local integrals which can be chosen in many different ways .",
    "it should seem , however , that the most convenient and physically sounding choice is that of the quasienergy integral which is directly linked to the periodicity of the driving force .",
    "in such an approach @xcite , the regular regime near a non - linear resonance is juxtaposed with the continuous evolution described by a conservative effective quasi - hamiltonian function .",
    "corresponding canonical hamilton equations generate continuous trajectories on which all phase points of the original map lie .",
    "the quasi - hamiltonian is found by perturbation expansion with respect to a small parameter which can , in particular , be the closeness to the resonance .",
    "after the quantum extension of the canonical maps had been suggested in @xcite , the quantum maps were widely used as informative models of quantum chaos . amongst them",

    "the diffusive growth of the qkr energy turns out to be restricted to a certain maximal value because of dynamical localization in the angular momentum space .    at the same time",
    ", there exit some important features of the qkr dynamics , namely so called quantum resonances , which have no counterparts in the disordered systems ( see @xcite and discussion in @xcite ) . at a fixed value of the kick parameter @xmath8 ,",

    "our results have already drown much interest of the authors ( private communication ) .",
    "the interesting and important problem of the impact of the quantum resonances on the qkr dynamics and the interplay between resonant and diffusive regimes is still far from a satisfactory understanding .",
    "investigation of this problem is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "we develop a general approach to the problem of the motion in a vicinity of a quantum resonance with an arbitrary _ order _ @xmath0 .",
    "generally , the influence of a quantum resonance depends on the relation between the order @xmath0 and the localization length @xmath15 in the angular momentum space .",
    "we show that the most important role is played by the resonances with @xmath3 : for finite regions around them the quantum motion is explicitly shown to be regular and dominates the motion for all values @xmath16 inside these regions - the resonance _",
    "widths_. more precisely , the motion is well described , during large though finite times , by a time - independent effective quasi - hamiltonian with one rotational degree of freedom and with a discrete spectrum .",
    "such a motion is in parallel with the classical phase oscillations near a non - linear resonance . on the contrary ,",
    "when the resonance order is large enough , @xmath17 the resonant quadratic growth appears only in the remote time asymptotic and for lesser times the motion reveals universal features characteristic of the localized quantum chaos .    in sec .",

    "the function @xmath27 satisfies standard schrdinger equation with the time - independent hamiltonian @xmath22 . obviously , the very possibility of the formal construction described is based on the periodicity of the map .",
    "that is why we refer below to this operator as the _ quasi - hamiltonian_.    let @xmath28 be the eigenvector of the floquet operator ( [ u ] ) , which belongs to an eigenvalue @xmath29 .",
    "then the quasi - hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath30 where the sum runs over the quasienergy spectrum @xmath31 of the rotator . as usual , each quasienergy",
    "is defined up to a term multiple @xmath32 which results in corresponding ambiguity of the quasi - hamiltonian ( [ epsh ] ) .",
    "however , each time one can fix the operator @xmath22 in the way most convenient for calculation .",
    "the ambiguity does not influence the evolution operator @xmath33 at integer moments . as a rule ,",
    "to get rid of the ambiguity we suggest continuity of the quasi - hamiltonian with respect to parameters under consideration . in the coordinate representation ,",
    "the quasi - hamiltonian is an operator function of the pair of canonically conjugate observables @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "since the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 do not belong to any finite algebra , the operator @xmath22 can not generally be found in a closed form .",

    "as it has been shown by f. izrailev and d. shepelyansky @xcite , at the point of a quantum resonances with the order @xmath0 the floquet operator can , generally , be presented as a @xmath38 matrix .",
    "this matrix turns out to be ( see below ) a local gauge transformation from the unitary @xmath1 group generated by a hermitian matrix @xmath39 which depends only on the angle and does not contain the angular momentum . owing to this fact , the problem of calculation of the matrix @xmath40 becomes as simple ( or complicated ) as that of diagonalization of a @xmath0-dimensional unitary matrix .",
    "the latter can be carried out analytically if the matrix order does not exceed 4 .",
    "dependence of the quasi - hamiltonian on the angular momentum recovers out of the points of quantum resonances . in some domain near a given quantum resonance with an order @xmath0",
    "this dependence can be found in the form of a power expansion over the detuning from the resonance .",
    "this expansion turns out to appear in the form of series , in particular , in powers of the angular momentum ( see eq .",
    "( [ cal hq ] ) below ) with the resonance matrix @xmath39 being the zero - order term in the series . actually , such an expansion is quite a formal one .",
    "the question of convergence by no means is trivial .",
    "at best , the series is of only asymptotic nature .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see below that a few its first terms give surprisingly good description of the evolution during a very long time .",
    "in the simplest case @xmath41 , the rotation operator @xmath9 is equivalent to the identity and the qkr evolution during a time @xmath42 is described by the unitary phase transformation @xmath43 .",

    "the angle @xmath34 is a quantum - mechanical coordinate operator in this problem , and the spectrum of the quasi - hamiltonian @xmath72 as well as of the floquet operator becomes discrete because of the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the main effect of the term quadratic in @xmath66 consists in cutting off the unrestricted kinetic energy growth .",
    "this is well seen in fig.1 already the lowest correction ( dotted line ) describes reasonably good the turn off from the quadratic resonant growth , as well as the mean height of the saturation plateau .",
    "the next one ( solid line ) substantially improves the description and reproduces well also the details of quantum fluctuations in the plateau region .",
    "influence of the further corrections , which contain , in particular , higher powers of the angular momentum @xmath66 , remains weak in the finite domain @xmath73 , the width of the resonance , where the angular momentum @xmath66 in the plateau region is still sufficiently small .    before analyzing the conditions of validity of eq .",
    "( [ aph1 ] ) in more detail , we consider the resonance @xmath74 because of a tangible similarity of the two cases . for @xmath74 , the rotation operator @xmath75 , where @xmath14 is an odd number , has only two eigenvalues 1 and -1 .",
    "obviously , any periodic function @xmath76 which contains only even ( odd ) harmonics is an eigenfunction belonging to the eigenvalue 1 ( -1 ) .",
    "an arbitrary state @xmath5 can be written down as the linear superposition @xmath77 of these eigenfunctions .",
    "therefore , in the hilbert space of the periodic functions the operator @xmath9 is isomorphic to the @xmath78 pauli matrix @xmath79 .",
    "one can actualize this isomorphism by representing the state @xmath5 in the form of a two - component spinor @xmath80 in this representation the differentiation operator @xmath35 which does not change harmonics numbers grows into the diagonal matrix @xmath81 while any periodic coordinate operator @xmath82 looks as @xmath83 with @xmath84 being the @xmath78 unity matrix . at last ,",

    "fig.2 ( points ) shows that quantitative agreement of this approximation with exact numerical simulations ( circles ) worsens rather fast .",

    "therefore , the influence of the higher terms of the expansion can be expected to be weak when @xmath112 .",
    "in contrast , the unit vectors @xmath113 and @xmath95 in eq.([f2 ] ) in the most interesting case @xmath114 contain @xmath115 harmonics and their derivatives with respect to @xmath34 are large .",
    "this leads to terms with extra powers of @xmath8 in the higher corrections , which are not compensated by the small detuning @xmath61 and enhance higher corrections .",

    "on the other hand , if the order of the resonance we are interested in is very large , @xmath17 , and this resonance lies in the region of typical irrationals being far from all strong resonances , already a very small detuning suffices for killing the quadratic growth with exponentially small rate . at the same time , such a shift does not influence the term @xmath308 which reproduces on exponentially large ( though finite ) time scale all characteristic features of the `` localized quantum chaos '' @xcite .",
