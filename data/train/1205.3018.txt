    "multi - messenger astronomy is entering a stimulating period with the recent development of experimental techniques that will open new windows of cosmic radiation observation in all its components .",
    "in particular , both high - energy ( @xmath0gev ) neutrinos ( hens ) and gravitational waves ( gws ) , neither of which have yet been directly observed from astrophysical sources , are becoming new tools for exploring the universe .",
    "while hens are expected to be produced in interactions between relativistic protons and the external radiation field of the source ( e.g. , @xcite ) , gws carry information on the intricate multi - dimensional dynamics in the source s central regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hens and gws are thus complementary messengers",
    ".    simultaneous emission of gws and hens has been proposed in a range of cataclysmic cosmic events including gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , soft - gamma repeater outbursts ( sgrs ) , and , potentially , cosmic string cusps in the early universe .",
    "observational constraints on hen and gw emission from some of these phenomena have already been obtained .",
    "the icecube collaboration recently placed limits on the hen emission in grbs ( @xcite ) , sgrs and blazars @xcite , and jet - driven ccsne @xcite using data from the icecube detector at various levels of completion .",
    "similarly , the antares  collaboration has placed limits on the hen flux from gamma - ray flaring blazars @xcite and grbs @xcite , as well as a diffuse muon neutrino flux from extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "these limits , however , do not yet strongly constrain hen emission and ultra - high - energy cosmic - ray production in relativistic outflows @xcite . the ligo  scientific collaboration and virgo",
    "placed limits on the gw emission in grbs @xcite and sgrs @xcite .",
    "the exclusion distances of these searches were , however , not sufficiently large to expect a gw detection .    the above hen and gw searches used timing and sky location information from observations of events in the electromagnetic spectrum . a potentially large subset of gw and hen sources may be intrinsically electromagnetically faint , dust - obscured , or missed by telescopes , but sufficiently luminous in gws and hen to be detected .",
    "such sources may include , but are not limited to , partially or completely choked grbs with , perhaps , only mildly relativistic jets @xcite , relativistic shock breakout in compact ccsn progenitor stars @xcite , and cosmic string cusps @xcite .",
    "searches for hens and gws from such events have thus far relied on blind ( i.e. , untriggered ) all - sky searches . @xcite",
    "performed an all - sky search for point sources of hens in icecube data and @xcite carried out a similar study with antares  data .",
    "ligo and virgo  have carried out a number of all - sky searches for gws . the most recent and most sensitive such search for model - independent gw bursts",
    "was published in @xcite , whereas the most recent all - sky search for binary inspiral - merger is @xcite .",
    "all - sky model - dependent constraints on cosmic string gw emission have been placed by @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of such blind all - sky searches is limited by a much larger background compared to searches based on timing and sky locations from electromagnetic observations .",
    "a search for _ temporally and spatially coincident _ hen and gw signals is a strong alternative to electromagnetically triggered or blind all - sky analyses that search for gws or hens individually .",
    "such a search is independent of bias from electromagnetic observations , but still enjoys a much reduced background thanks to timing and sky location constraints .",
    "a similar idea has been used in the follow - up of candidate gw events by the low - energy neutrino detector lvd @xcite .",
    "a joint gw - hen search was first proposed by @xcite and @xcite , and @xcite have derived constraints on joint gw - hen signals based on the interpretation of independent gw and hen observational results . here",
    "we present the first direct search for coincident gw - hen events , using data taken by the antares  hen telescope and by the ligo  and virgo  gw observatories from january to september 2007 . at this time , antares  was still under construction and operating with only 5 active lines . at the same time , the fifth ligo  science run ( s5 ) and the first virgo  science run ( vsr1 ) were carried out .",
    "this was the first joint run of the ligo - virgo  network with the detectors operating near their design sensitivities .",
    "the basic principle of the analysis presented here is that of a `` triggered '' search : hen candidates are identified in the antares  data , then the gw data around the time of the hen event are analyzed for a gw incident from the hen estimated arrival direction .",
    "this method has been applied previously in searches for gws associated with grb triggers @xcite .",
    "it has been shown to have a distance reach up to a factor of 2 larger @xcite than a blind all - sky search of the gw data , due to the reduced background .",
    "the expected rate of detections depends also on the beaming of the trigger signal , since the triggered search is only sensitive to the subset of sources oriented towards earth .",
    "@xcite compares the analysis method used in this paper to the ligo - virgo  blind all - sky search @xcite and predicts a detection rate for the triggered search of between @xmath10.1 and @xmath16 times that of the blind search for beaming angles in the range 5@xmath2  30@xmath2 .",
    "these numbers are broadly consistent with estimates for the special case of dedicated matched - filter searches for compact binary coalescence signals associated with short grbs ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) after rescaling for a smaller distance improvement factor ( typically @xmath11.3 , due to the better inherent background rejection of these specialised searches ) . in either case",
    ", most of the gw events found by the triggered search will be new detections not found by the all - sky blind search , illustrating the value of the triggered search even when the relative detection rate is low @xcite .",
    "we analyze a total of 158 hen events detected at times when two or more of the ligo - virgo  detectors were operating .",
    "antares  is sensitive to hens with energies greater than @xmath3gev @xcite .",
    "the ligo - virgo  analysis targets model - independent burst gw signals with durations @xmath41s and frequencies in the 60hz to 500hz band .",
    "the gw search is extended in frequency up to 2000hz only for a subset of the hen events , because the computational cost of such a search with the current gw analysis pipeline is prohibitive .",
    "statistical analyses of the hen sample show no sign of associated gw bursts .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sources ]",
    "we discuss sources of coincident hen and gw emission and expected prospects for their detection . in section  [ sec : detectors ] we describe the antares , ligo , and virgo  detectors and the joint data taking period . section  [ sec : henselection ] describes how the hen sample was selected .",
    "section  [ sec : gwselection ] describes the search for gws coincident in time and direction with the hen events .",
    "we present the results of the search in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss the astrophysical implications of the results in section  [ sec : astrophysics ] and conclude with considerations of the potential for future joint gw - hen searches .",
    "hen emission is expected from baryon - loaded relativistic astrophysical outflows . in the most common scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "fermi - accelerated relativistic protons interact with high - energy outflow photons in @xmath5 reactions leading to pions or kaons , whose decay results in neutrinos , e.g. , @xmath6 , which is the dominant process ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this gives @xmath7 production ratios of @xmath8 , changing to approximately @xmath9 at earth due to flavor oscillations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hen spectrum depends on the spectrum of the accelerated protons ( e.g. , @xcite ) and , thus , on the properties of the astrophysical source . in this section ,",
    "we provide estimates of the sensitivity of the 5-line antares  detector for hens from the various potential sources by estimating the probability @xmath10 that at least one hen is detected for a source at a given distance @xmath11 .",
    "gw emission occurs , at lowest and generally dominant order , via accelerated quadrupolar mass - energy dynamics .",
    "the coupling constant in the standard quadrupole formula for gw emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) is @xmath12 and the directly detectable gw strain scales with ( distance)@xmath13 .",
    "for example , a source at @xmath14 needs a quadrupole moment of @xmath15 that is changing on a millisecond timescale to be detectable by a gw detector sensitive to a strain of @xmath16 .",
    "equivalently , the minimum gw energy emission detectable by the ligo - virgo network at this distance is approximately @xmath17 to @xmath18 for frequencies between 100 hz and 1000 hz @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss a number of astrophysical scenarios in which both hens and gws may be emitted at detectable levels .",
    "[ sec : lgrb ]    long - duration grbs ( lgrbs ; @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the time over which @xmath21 of the @xmath22 counts are detected ) are observationally implicated to be related to the collapse of massive stars normally leading to core - collapse supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "typical lgrbs are strongly beamed and most likely have jets with lorentz factors @xmath23 and isotropic equivalent luminosities of @xmath24 to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "lgrbs are detected at a rate of order @xmath26/(few days ) by @xmath22-ray monitors on satellite observatories such as swift / bat @xcite and fermi / gbm @xcite .",
    "it is important to note , however , that swift / bat and fermi / gbm miss @xmath190% and @xmath140% of the prompt emission of all grbs , respectively .",
    "this is due to limited fields of view , technical downtime , and orbital passes through the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "a nearby ( say @xmath110mpc ) lgrb will have a bright multi - wavelength afterglow and may be accompanied by a ccsn ( see  [ sec : llgrb ] ) , but a significant fraction of local ccsne may have been missed by ccsn surveys based on galaxy catalogs @xcite .    the central engine of lgrbs is expected to either be a _ collapsar _ ( a black hole with an accretion disk ; @xcite ) or a _ millisecond magnetar _ ( an extremely rapidly spinning , extremely magnetized neutron star ; e.g. , @xcite ) . in both scenarios ,",
    "hen emission may result from a relativistic expanding fireball .",
    "hens may begin to be produced even before the jet breaks out of the stellar envelope @xcite and may continue well into the afterglow phase @xcite .",
    "hen emission from canonical lgrbs is expected to have appreciable flux for energies in the range @xmath27 to @xmath28 . for a lgrb at @xmath1@xmath29 ( @xmath1@xmath14 ) one would expect of order @xmath26 ( @xmath30 ) hen events in a @xmath31-scale water- or ice - cherenkov detector ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the flux predictions of @xcite , the probability for detection in the 5-line antares  detector can be estimated to be @xmath150% for a source at 10mpc , which decreases to @xmath1@xmath32 for a source at @xmath29 .",
    "note that these are most likely optimistic estimates , since more detailed analyses suggest lower hen fluxes from grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "such a scenario may be unlikely given model predictions for the rotational configuration of grb progenitor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "its gw emission , however , would be very strong , leading to emitted energies @xmath33 to @xmath34 in the @xmath35 to @xmath36 frequency band of highest sensitivity of the initial ligo / virgo  detectors , which could observe such an event out to approximately @xmath37 to @xmath38 @xcite .    in more moderate scenarios backed by computational models ,",

    "the angular sensitivity of virgo  is complementary to that of the ligo  detectors , virgo  therefore enhances the sky coverage of the network .",
    "moreover , simultaneous observations of multiple detectors are crucial to reject environmental and instrumental effects .    at the time of writing the ligo  and virgo  interferometers",
    "are undergoing upgrades to `` advanced '' configurations with distance sensitivity improved by approximately a factor of 10 @xcite .",
    "the advanced instruments will commence operations around 2015 .",
    "the fifth ligo  science run , s5 @xcite , was held from 2005 november 4 to 2007 october 1 .",
    "over one year of science - quality data were collected with all three ligo  interferometers in simultaneous operation at their design sensitivity , with duty factors of @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 for h1 , h2 , and l1 .",
    "the virgo  detector started its first science run , vsr1 @xcite , on 2007 may 18 .",
    "the virgo  duty factor over vsr1 was @xmath101 . during this period ,",
    "antares  was operating in its 5 line configuration .",
    "the concomitant set of antares  5-line ( 5l ) , vsr1 and s5 data covers the period between january 27 and september 30 , 2007 ; these data are the subject of the analysis presented here .",
    "the antares  data sample used in the analysis is composed of runs from 2007 selected according to various quality criteria , based mainly on environmental parameters ( e.g. sea current , counting rates ) , configuration and behaviour of the detector during the given run ( e.g. duration of the run , alignment of the detector ) .",
    "two basic quantities are used to characterise the counting rate of a given om : the baseline rate ( @xmath102k activity and bioluminescence ) and the burst fraction ( flashes of light emitted by marine organisms ) .",
    "the baseline rate represents the most probable counting rate of a given om computed from the rate distributions in each pmt over the whole run ( typically a few hours ) .",
    "the burst fraction corresponds to the fraction of time during which the om counting rates exceed by more than 20% the estimated baseline .",
    "the data selected for this search are required to have a baseline rate below 120 khz and a burst fraction lower than 40% , with 80% of all oms being active . with these quality criteria ,",
    "the active time is 103.4 days out of the 244.8 days of the 5-line period . finally , when restricting the data to the concomitant period with ligo / virgo , the remaining equivalent time of observation is @xmath103 days .",
    "the antares  trigger system is multi - level @xcite . the first level is applied _ in situ _ , while the remaining levels intervene after all data are sent to the shore station and before being written on disk .",
    "trigger decisions are based on calculations done at three levels .",
    "the first trigger level , l0 , is a simple threshold of about 0.3 photo - electron ( pe ) equivalent charge applied to the analog signal of the pmt .",
    "the second level trigger , l1 , is based on two coincident l0 hits in the same storey within 20ns or hits with large charge ( @xmath104 3pe or 10pe depending on the configuration ) . the l2 trigger requires the presence of at least five l1 hits in a 2.2@xmath105s time window ( roughly the maximum muon transit time across the detector ) and that each pair of l1 hits are causally related according to the following condition : @xmath106ns . here",
    "@xmath107 and @xmath108 are the time difference and distance between hits @xmath109 and @xmath110 , @xmath111 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath112 is the index of refraction .",
    "hits selected according to the criteria described in section  [ sec : triggers ] are then combined to reconstruct tracks using their arrival time and charge as measured by the corresponding om .",
    "muons are assumed to cross the detector at the speed of light along a straight line from which the induced cherenkov light originates . the time and charge information of the hits in the pmts",
    "is used in a minimisation procedure to obtain the track parameters , namely , its direction @xmath113 and the position @xmath114 of one track point at a given time @xmath115 . the reconstruction algorithm used for",
    "this analysis is a fast and robust method @xcite which was primarily designed to be used on - line .",
    "the algorithm is based on a @xmath116-minimisation approach .",
    "its strict hit selection leads to a high purity up - down separation while keeping a good efficiency .",
    "the exact geometry of the detector is ignored : the detector lines are treated as straight and the 3 oms of each storey are considered as a single om centered on the line .",
    "thus , the hit s altitude corresponds to the optical modules altitude .",
    "all hits at the same floor in coincidence within 20ns are merged into one hit .",
    "the time of the merged hit is that of the earliest hit in the group and its charge is the sum of the charges .",
    "the algorithm uses the l1 hits as a seed for the hit selection .",
    "it requests a coincidence of 2 l1 hits in two adjacent floors within 80ns or 160ns in two next - to - adjacent floors .",
    "the quality of the reconstruction is measured by a @xmath116-like variable with _ ndf _",
    "degrees of freedom , based on the time differences between the hit times @xmath117 and the expected arrival time @xmath118 of photons from the track or bright - point ( see section  [ sec : criteriahen ] ) .",
    "the quality function is then extended with a term that accounts for measured hit charges @xmath119 and the calculated photon travel distances @xmath120 : @xmath121.\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath122 is the timing error , set to 10ns for charges larger than 2.5pe and to 20ns otherwise .",

    ", @xmath124 is the average hit charge calculated from all hits which have been selected for the fit and @xmath125 is the typical distance at which the signal in one pmt from a cherenkov light front is of the order of 1 pe .",
    "the function @xmath126 accounts for the angular acceptance of the oms , while @xmath127 penalises large amplitude hits originating from large distance tracks .",
    "a proper cut on the fit quality parameter allows the isolation of a high purity neutrino sample , which is crucial in the subsequent analysis .      for a particle trajectory reconstructed from a cherenkov cone giving hits on only two straight detector lines , there always exists an alternative trajectory having an identical @xmath116 value , but a different direction . the degenerate trajectory is the mirror image of the original track in the plane formed by the two lines . as a consequence ,",
    "each event reconstructed with only two lines will have two equiprobable arrival directions , which must be taken into account during the subsequent gw analysis .",
    "the initial sample of reconstructed events contains both upgoing neutrino induced muons and downgoing muons from cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "some of the atmospheric muons are misreconstructed as upgoing and the selection cuts , based on monte - carlo simulations , are devised to reduce this contamination so as to maximise the discovery potential .",
    "a minimum of 6 hits on at least 2 lines are required to reconstruct a track .",
    "only upgoing tracks are kept for further analysis .",
    "quality cuts are then applied based on two quantities computed according to equation  ( [ eqchi2 ] ) .",
    "the first parameter used , @xmath128 , is the quality factor associated with the reconstructed particle track , whereas the second one , @xmath129 , is associated with a bright - point , light emitted from a point - like source inside the detector .",
    "this rejects events from large electromagnetic showers , likely to appear in downgoing muon bundles for instance .",
    "a cut on @xmath129 reduces the number of such events and decreases the contribution of misreconstructed muons in the background .",
    "further cuts are applied on @xmath128 depending on the arrival direction of the candidate - the muon contamination increases close to the horizon - which reduce the fraction of misreconstructed muons to less than 20% over the whole sample , while optimising the sensitivity ( see section [ sec : henanalysis ] and @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : henselectedevents ] shows the distribution of the sine of the declination of the events selected with the final cuts , which is globally consistent with background .     of selected events ( black points ) ,",

    "the location parameter @xmath135 is close to zero , and @xmath136 is always satisfied .",
    "this distribution depends on the energy associated to the track ( estimated through the number of photons detected ) and its declination .",

    "this number is estimated from simulations .    for those events of our selected sample reconstructed with at least three lines",
    "the angular resolution is , assuming an @xmath137 energy spectrum , @xmath139 at 100gev , improving to @xmath140 around 100tev . for 2-line events ,",
    "when selecting the reconstructed track closer to the true direction , the angular accuracy varies between 3@xmath141 at low energy ( 100gev ) and @xmath142 at high energy ( 100tev ) .",
    "we define the angular search window for the gw analysis as the 90@xmath138 percentile of the distribution , also indicated in figure [ fig : henspaceangle ] ; this window lies between 5@xmath141 and 10@xmath141 for 3-line events , depending on declination , and between 10@xmath141 and 15@xmath141 for 2-line events .",
    "we note that the typical angular distance between galaxies within 10mpc is a few degrees @xcite , much smaller than the typical size of the 90@xmath138 percentile error region for our hen events .",
    "this implies that we can associate a potential host galaxy to any of the hen candidates if it turns out to be of cosmic origin .",
    "the limit - setting potential of the analysis , or sensitivity , has been quantified for the whole 5 line data period .",
    "specifically , the sensitivity is defined as the median 90% upper limit obtained over an ensemble of simulated experiments with no true signal .",
    "the sensitivity depends on the declination of the potential source . for our sample and",
    "assuming an @xmath137 steady flux , using the selection criteria described , the best sensitivity has been estimated to be @xmath143@xmath144s@xmath13 .",
    "this best sensitivity is reached below @xmath145 ; i.e. , at declinations which are always below the horizon at the latitude of antares ( @xmath146n ) .    with the selection previously described , 181 runs corresponding to 104 days of live time were kept for the analysis .",
    "the selection has been divided into events reconstructed with 2 lines and events with at least 3 lines .",
    "each of the mirror solutions for 2 line events will be searched for possible counterparts in the subsequent gw analysis .",
    "this results in 216 neutrinos to be analysed : 198 with two possible directions and 18 reconstructed with at least 3 lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : maphen ] is a sky map of the candidate hen events , where the degenerate solutions for 2 line events can be seen .",
    "of these hen events , 158 occurred at times when at least two gravitational - wave detectors were operating .",
    "since two or more detectors are required to discriminate gw signals from background noise ( as described in section  [ sec : gwevents ] ) , in the following we consider only these remaining @xmath147 hen candidates : @xmath148 2-line events and @xmath149 3-line events .",
    "finally , we note that icecube operated in its 22-string configuration for part of 2007 @xcite .",
    "however , this data was only used for time - dependent searches applied to source directions with observed x - ray or gamma - ray emission , such as grbs ; there were no untriggered , time - dependent searches over the sky .",
    "furthermore , a comparison of antares and icecube sensitivities in 2007 indicates that the bulk of our hen neutrino triggers come from declinations ( the southern sky ) such that it is unlikely that icecube could have detected the source independently .",
    "one of the simplest searches that may be performed combining gw and hen data is a triggered analysis that scans gw data around the time of the putative neutrino event by cross - correlating data from pairs of detectors .",
    "this search exploits knowledge of the time and direction of the neutrino event to improve the gw search sensitivity .",
    "we use the x - pipeline  algorithm @xcite , which has been used in similar searches for gws associated with grbs @xcite .",
    "x - pipeline  performs a coherent analysis of data from arbitrary networks of gravitational wave detectors , while being robust against background noise fluctuations .",
    "each trigger is analysed independently of the others , with the analysis parameters optimised based on background noise characteristics and detector performance at the time of that trigger , thereby maximising the search sensitivity .      in our gw search , a neutrino candidate event is characterised by its arrival time , direction , and angular search window ( and mirror - image window , for the 2-line events ) .",
    "also important is the range of possible time delays ( both positive and negative ) between the neutrino emission and the associated gravitational - wave emission .",
    "this quantity is referred to as the _ on - source _ window for the neutrino ; it is the time interval which is searched for gw signals .",
    "we use a symmetric on - source window of @xmath150496s @xcite , which is conservative enough to encompass most theoretical models of gw and hen emission . the maximum expected time delay between gws and hens due to a non - zero mass effect for",
    "either particle is much smaller than the coincidence windows used .",
    "the basic search procedure follows that used in @xcite .",
    "all detectors operating at the time of the trigger and which pass data - quality requirements are used for the gw search .",
    "the data from each detector are first whitened and time - delayed according to the sky location being analysed so that a gw signal from that direction would appear simultaneous in each data stream .",
    "the data are then fourier transformed to produce time - frequency maps .",
    "the maps are summed coherently ( using amplitude and phase ) with weighting determined by each detector s frequency - dependent sensitivity and response to the sky location in question ; the weightings are chosen to maximise the signal - to - noise ratio expected for a circularly polarized gw signal , which is the expected polarisation for a gw source observed from near the rotational axis @xcite .",
    "a threshold is placed on the map to retain the largest 1% of pixels by energy ( squared amplitude ) . surviving pixels are grouped using next - nearest - neighbours clustering ; each cluster of pixels is considered as a candidate gw event .",
    "the event cluster is assigned a combined energy by summing the energy values of its constituent pixels ; this combined energy is used as the ranking statistic for the events .",
    "in addition to the marginalised circular polarization sum , a second ranking statistic is computed based on a maximum - likelihood analysis of the event assuming power - law distributed background noise with no assumption on the gw polarization . in practice this statistic is often found to provide signal - noise separation due to the non - gaussian nature of the gw detector noise .",
    "other combinations of the data are also constructed .",
    "of particular importance are `` null '' combinations designed to cancel out the gw signal from the given sky location ; comparison to corresponding `` incoherent '' combinations provides powerful tests for identifying events due to background noise fluctuations @xcite , and are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "events are also characterised by their duration , central time , bandwidth , and central frequency .",
    "the time - frequency analysis is repeated for fourier transform lengths of 1/128 , 1/64 , 1/32 , 1/16 , 1/8 , 1/4s , to maximise the sensitivity to gw signals of different durations .",
    "it is also repeated over a grid of sky positions covering the 90% containment region of the hen .",
    "this grid is designed such that the maximum relative timing error between any pair of gw detectors is less that 0.5ms .",
    "when gw events from different fourier transforms lengths or sky positions overlap in time - frequency , the highest - ranked event is kept and the others discarded . finally , the events are decimated to a rate of 0.25hz before being written to disk .",
    "this time - frequency analysis is performed for all of the data in the @xmath150496s on - source window . to estimate the significance of the resulting gw candidates",
    ", the same analysis is repeated for all coincident data in the _ off - source _ window , defined as all data within @xmath151hours of the neutrino time , excluding the on - source interval .",
    "the same set of detectors and data - quality requirements as in the on - source analysis are used for the off - source data .",
    "these off - source data provide a sample of background that does not contain any signal associated with the neutrino event , but with statistical features similar to the data searched in association with the neutrino . to enlarge the background sample",
    ", we also repeat the off - source analysis after applying time shifts of multiples of 6 s to the data from one or more detectors ; with such time slides we were able to produce @xmath152 background trials for each hen .",
    "finally , the analysis is repeated after `` injecting '' ( adding ) simulated gw signals to the on - source data .",
    "the amplitudes and morphologies tested are discussed in section  [ sec : injections ] .",
    "we use these simulations to optimise and assess the sensitivity of the search , as discussed below .",
    "the sensitivity of searches for gravitational - wave bursts tends to be limited by the presence of non - gaussian fluctuations of the background noise , known as glitches . to reduce this background , events that overlap in time within known instrumental and/or environmental disturbances",
    "are discarded .",
    "in addition to this `` veto '' step , gw consistency tests comparing the coherent and incoherent energies are applied to each event @xcite .",
    "these tests are applied to the on - source , off - source and injection events ; events failing one or more of these tests are discarded .",
    "the thresholds are optimised by testing a preset range of thresholds and selecting those which give the best overall detection efficiency at a fixed false alarm probability of 1% when applied to a random sample of background and injection events ( the on - source events are _ not _ used ; i.e. , this is a blind analysis ) .",
    "these tests also determine which of the two ranking statistics discussed in section  [ sec : gwevents ] ( based on circularly polarized gw energy or powerlaw noise ) gives the better detection efficiency ; the winner is selected as the final ranking statistic .",
    "once the thresholds have been fixed , these consistency tests are applied to the on - source events and to the remaining off - source and injection events ( those not used for tuning ) .",
    "the surviving on - source event with the largest significance ( highest energy or powerlaw statistic ) is taken to be the best candidate for a gravitational wave signal and is referred to as the loudest event @xcite .",
    "all surviving on - source events are assigned a false alarm probability by comparison to the distribution of loudest events from the off - source trials .",
    "any on - source event with probability @xmath153 is subjected to additional checks to try to determine the origin of the event and additional background time slide trials are performed to improve the accuracy of the false alarm probability estimate .    after the @xmath154 values have been determined for the loudest events associated with each of the 158 hen events , the collective set of @xmath154 values is tested for consistency with the null hypothesis ( no gw signal ) using the binomial test , discussed in section  [ sec : binomial ] .",
    "we also set a frequentist upper limit on the strength of gravitational waves associated with each neutrino trigger , as discussed in section  [ sec : gwuls ] .      given our knowledge of possible gw sources discussed in section  [ sec : sources ] , the most likely detectable signals at extra - galactic distances are in the low - frequency band ( @xmath155hz ) , where our detectors have maximum sensitivity , see fig [ fig : spectra ] . at the same time , the computational cost of the x - pipeline  analysis increases at high frequencies .",
    "this is due in part to the extra data to be analysed , but also to the need for finer - resolution sky grids to keep time delay errors much smaller than one gw period .",
    "we therefore split the gravitational wave band into two regions : 60hz to 500hz and 500hz to 2000hz .",
    "the low - frequency band is analysed for all hen events  such a search is computationally feasible while covering the highest - sensitivity region of the gw detectors .",
    "however , compact objects such as neutron stars or collapsar cores have characteristic frequencies for gw emission above 500hz .",
    "such emissions might be detectable from galactic sources such as soft gamma repeater giant flares , or possibly from nearby galaxies . since the computational cost of a high - frequency search for all hen events is prohibitive with the current analysis pipeline",
    ", we perform the 500hz to 2000hz analysis on the 3-line hen events only .",
    "the 3-line events are a small subset ( @xmath110% ) of the total trigger list and have the smallest sky position uncertainties , and therefore the smallest computational cost for processing . to reduce the computational cost further",
    ", we use the same sky grid for the high - frequency search as was used at low frequencies , after determining that the loss of sensitivity is acceptable .",
    "the high - frequency analysis is performed independently of the low - frequency analysis ( independent tuning , background estimation , etc . ) using the identical automated procedure . in the following sections we will present the results of the low- frequency and high - frequency searches separately .",
    "we analysed gw data in coincidence with 158 neutrino candidates for the low frequency search , and 14 neutrino events for the high frequency search . in the low frequency analysis ,",
    "only one neutrino trigger had a corresponding gw event with false alarm probability below the threshold of @xmath156 to become a candidate event .",
    "we found no candidates in the high frequency search .",
    "for the low - frequency candidate , additional time shifts totaling 18064 background trials yielded a refined false alarm probability of @xmath157 , which is not significant given a trials factor of 158 ( this statement is quantified below ) .",
    "this event came from analysis of the h1 , h2 , and v1 data ; follow - up checks were performed , including checks of detector performance at the time as indicated by monitoring programs and operator logs , and scans of data from detector and environmental monitoring equipment to look for anomalous behaviour . while these checks did not uncover a physical cause for the event , they did reveal that it occurred during a glitching period in v1 .",
    "we conclude that we have no clear gravitational wave burst signal associated with any of our sample of 158 neutrino events",
    ".      a quantitative analysis of the significance of any candidate gravitational - wave event must take account of the trials factor due to the number of neutrino events analysed .",

    "the polarization angle ( orientation of the rotational axis on the sky ) is distributed uniformly . finally , the amplitude and arrival time at each detector is perturbed randomly to simulate the effect of calibration errors in the ligo  and virgo  detectors .      for each waveform type we set a 90% confidence level lower limit on the distance to a gw source associated with a given hen trigger .",
    "this is defined as the maximum distance @xmath170 such that for any distance @xmath171 there is a probability of at least 0.9 that such a gw signal would have produced an event louder than the loudest on - source event actually measured . for inspirals , each distance corresponds to a well - defined amplitude .",
    "we can associate an amplitude to each distance for the sine - gaussian waveforms as well , by assuming a fixed energy in gravitational waves .",
    "for concreteness , we select @xmath188 .",
    "this corresponds to the optimistic limit of possible gravitational - wave emission by various processes in the collapsing cores of rapidly rotating massive stars ( @xcite , and discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : sources ] ) ; more conservative estimates based on simulations have been made in @xcite .",
    "for each type of gravitational wave simulated , the distributions of exclusion distances for our neutrino sample are shown in figures  [ fig : distances ] and  [ fig : distances_2 ] . for binary neutron star systems of @xmath189 and",
    "black hole - neutron star systems of @xmath190 typical distance limits are 5mpc and 10mpc respectively . for the sine - gaussian waveforms with @xmath191",
    "we find typical distance limits between 5mpc and 17mpc in the low - frequency band and of order 1mpc in the high - frequency band .",
    "for other @xmath182 the limits scale as @xmath192 .",
    "for example , for @xmath193 ( typical of core - collapse supernovae ) a signal would only be observable from a galactic source .",

    "observational constraints on joint sources of gw and hen signals have been derived in @xcite . however , they are based on the interpretation and the combination of previously published and independent gw and hen observational results .",
    "the results presented in this section are the first derived from a joint gw - hen analysis , using concomitant data obtained with ligo / virgo  and antares .",
    "the present search for gw and hen correlations in space and time revealed no evidence for coincident events .",
    "this implies a 90% confidence level upper limit on the rate of detectable coincidences of @xmath195 , where @xmath196 days is the duration of coincident observations .",
    "this can be expressed as a limit on the rate density ( number per unit time per unit volume ) @xmath197 of joint gw - hen sources : @xmath198 here @xmath199 is the beaming factor ( the ratio of the total number of sources to the number with jets oriented towards earth gives @xmath200 , while @xmath201 gives @xmath202 . ] ) , and @xmath203 is the volume of universe probed by the present analysis for typical gw - hen sources .",
    "we take as fiducial sources two classes of objects : the final merger phase of the coalescence of two compact objects ( short grb - like ) , or the collapse of a massive object ( long grb - like ) , both followed by the emission of a relativistic hadronic jet .",
    "we define the hen horizon as the distance for which the probability to detect at least 1 hen in antares  with 5 lines is 50% . in the case of short grbs ( sgrbs )",
    ", the hen horizon is estimated to be @xmath204mpc using @xcite , while the typical gw horizon from the inspiral model is 5mpc to 10mpc depending on the binary masses . for long grbs ( lgrb )",
    "the hen horizon increases to @xmath205mpc using @xcite .",
    "the gw emission associated with long grbs is highly uncertain ; our optimistic assumption of @xmath206 at low frequencies gives a typical horizon distance of 10mpc to 20mpc in gw .",
    "using the lower of the gw and hen distances in each case yields from equation ( [ eq_astro1 ] ) approximate limits on the population density .",
    "for sgrb - like sources , related to the merger of two compact objects , we find @xmath207 .",
    "for lgrb - like sources , related to the collapse of massive stars , we find @xmath208 , where @xmath209 .",
    "+      @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest a local rate density of sgrbs of @xmath210 to @xmath211 after correcting for beaming effects .",
    "this is similar to the abundance of binary neutron star mergers , their assumed progenitors , estimated to be @xmath212 to @xmath213 ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and well below the reach of the present search ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "with @xmath215 , an improvement of a factor 10 on the detection distance is required in order to begin constraining the fraction of mergers producing coincident gw@xmath216hen signals .",
    "@xcite estimate a total rate of long grbs of @xmath217 after correcting for beaming effects ; these sources are closely related to type ii and type ibc core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the local rate of snibc is @xmath218 @xcite , whereas @xmath219 @xcite , relatively close to the obtained limit @xmath220 under our optimistic assumptions of gw emission in this scenario .",
    "a factor 10 only is required in order to begin constraining the fraction of stellar collapse events producing coincident weakly beamed gw - hen signals , which translates into a required improvement of 2 on the detection distance .",
    "this first joint gw - hen search using 2007 data , obtained with the antares  hen telescope and the virgo / ligo  gw interferometers , opens the way to a novel multi - messenger astronomy .",
    "limits on the rate density @xmath197 of joint gw - hen emitting systems were extracted for the first time using the analysis of coincident gw - hen data .",
    "we note that these limits are consistent with the ones obtained in @xcite derived from independent gw - hen observations .",
    "more stringent limits will be available by performing similar coincidence analyses using other data sets provided by the same instruments .",
    "for instance , the sixth ligo  science run s6 and second and third virgo  science runs vsr2,3 covered the period from 7 july 2009 to 21 october 2010 . meanwhile , the antares  telescope has taken data with first 10 then 12 active lines since the end of december 2007 .",
    "their enhanced sensitivities should permit a combined analysis to gain the factor required to obtain @xmath221 and begin to constrain the fraction of stellar collapse events accompanied by the coincident emission of relativistic jets beamed towards earth .",
    "the analysis of these data is underway , and a similar analysis using data from the ligo / virgo  s5-vsr1 periods and the icecube  hen telescope in its 22 string configuration is being finalized .",
    "future observing runs involving icecube , km3net  @xcite , and the advanced ligo  and advanced virgo  projects @xcite , are likely to coincide as well .",
    "they will give other opportunities to look for potential coincident gw - hen emissions .",
