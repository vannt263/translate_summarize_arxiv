    "over the past 2 decades , impressive evidence has been assembled for the existence of circumstellar dust disks around main - sequence ( ms ) stars as well as pre - ms stars ( t tauri stars and herbig ae / be stars ) , post - ms stars ( red giants ) , and a white dwarf ( see zuckerman 2001 for a review ) . a wide variety of observational techniques",
    "have been employed to study the formation / evolution and physical / chemical properties of dust disks : optical and near - infrared ( ir ) imaging of scattered stellar light , photometric measurements of dust thermal emission from near - ir to submillimeter , spectroscopic observations of mid - ir dust emission features and gas emission lines and ultraviolet ( uv ) and visible gas absorption lines .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is of particular interest in inferring the size and composition of dust grains and the disk structure ( dust spatial distribution ) .",
    "however , the limitations of this method have not been adequately explored ; for example , in modelling the @xmath1 sed , li & greenberg ( 1998 ) found that the dust spatial distribution is coupled with the distribution of dust sizes , i.e. , the distribution of dust in the disk and dust sizes can not be uniquely determined simultaneously by the sed alone .",
    "it is the aim of this _ letter _ to quantify the limitations on the information derived from the sed modelling concerning the dust properties ( composition and size ) and disk structure .",
    "we take the sed of @xmath0 , a nearby ( distance to earth @xmath2 ) young ms star ( age @xmath3 ) of spectral type a0v ( effective temperature @xmath4 ) for comparison with model results .",
    "@xmath0 has the largest fractional ir luminosity relative to the total stellar luminosity ( @xmath5 ) among the @xmath6 a - type ms stars in the _ yale bright star catalogue _ ( jura 1991 ) .",
    "the dust disk in orbit around @xmath0 has been extensively studied , both observationally and theoretically ( see zuckerman 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "with its relatively well determined dust and disk properties , @xmath0 serves as a good comparison basis for the sed modelling efforts described in this _",
    "letter_. we stress that the main purpose of this _ letter _ is not to carry out a detailed study of the @xmath0 dust disk which we defer to a subsequent paper ( a. li & j.i .",
    "lunine 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "we will first outline our approach in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we then discuss in  [ sec : spasize ] the degeneracy between the dust spatial distribution and dust sizes under the assumption of pure silicate dust . in ",
    "[ sec : composition ] we show that the dust composition is not well constrained by the observed sed unless mid - ir spectroscopic dust emission features are available .",
    "we discuss in  [ sec : discussion ] the possible dust composition and morphology from the evolutionary point of view that circumstellar dust disks around ( pre-)ms stars are formed through the coagulation of interstellar solids .",
    "we also summarize our major conclusions in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "grains in the optically thin dust disk of @xmath0 absorb the stellar uv / optical photons and then re - radiate them in the ir . very small grains or large molecules ( with spherical radius smaller than 100@xmath7 ) which are subject to single - photon heating ( draine & li 2001 ) will not be considered here although their presence in the disk can not be ruled out ( e.g. , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are seen in the disk of hd100546 through their 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath8 emission features [ malfait et al .  1998 ] ) . for grains",
    "@xmath9 we first use mie theory to calculate absorption cross sections assuming a spherical shape .",
    "we then calculate grain equilibrium temperatures ( and corresponding ir emission ) by balancing absorption and emission . for a given dust size distribution and a given disk structure ( dust spatial density distribution ) ,",
    "the emergent ir emission spectrum can be obtained by integrating over the dust size range , and over the entire disk .",
    "we have the following parameters to be specified or constrained : ( 1 ) dust composition  we will consider amorphous silicate , amorphous carbon , and cometary grains ( porous aggregates of small silicate and carbon dust ; greenberg 1982 ) ; ( 2 ) dust sizes  we will consider a power law dust size distribution @xmath10 characterized by the lower - cutoff @xmath11 , upper - cutoff @xmath12 and power - law index @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the spherical radius ) ; ( 3 ) dust spatial density distribution  we will consider two dramatically different distribution functions : a power law distribution @xmath15 and a gaussian distribution @xmath16 $ ] , the former is characterized by the disk s inner boundary @xmath17 , outer boundary @xmath18 , and power - law index @xmath19 ; the latter is characterized by the radial position @xmath20 where @xmath21 peaks and the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath22 .",
    "jura et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1998 ) and augereau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated that grains with radius exceeding a few micron are stable against radiation pressure .",
    "telesco et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimated the `` characteristic '' radius for the 1020@xmath8 mid - ir - emitting grains to be @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath24 .",
    "we take @xmath25 ( this is a noncritical parameter since grains larger than @xmath26 are like blackbodies and their ir emission spectra are size - insensitive ) .    to be conservative , we first set the inner boundary at @xmath27 inside of which micron - sized silicate and carbonaceous grains would be heated to @xmath28 and evaporate .",
    "the outer boundary is taken to be @xmath29 which is expected from the disk truncation caused by the tidal effects of @xmath30 , a companion star of @xmath0 ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "other values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 estimated from the near- and mid - ir imaging observations will also be discussed ( see  [ sec : spasize ] ) . for the gaussian - type dust spatial distribution , we take the peak distance ( from the central star ) of the distribution to be @xmath31 as reflected from the near - ir imaging of scattered starlight ( schneider et al .",
    "1999 ) and mid - ir imaging of dust thermal emission ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "1998 ; koerner et al .  1998 ; telesco et al .",
    "therefore , we are only left with two free parameters : the dust size distribution power index @xmath13 and the dust spatial distribution power index @xmath19 or the fwhm @xmath22 of the gaussian - type spatial distribution .",
    "we first consider compact silicate grains .",
    "we adopt the indices of refraction of the draine & lee ( 1984 ) `` astronomical '' silicate .",
    "we approximate the @xmath0 radiation field by the kurucz model atmosphere spectrum for a0v stars ( kurucz 1979 ) .",
    "we will compare our model results with the available photometric data compiled by augereau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the @xmath0 disk .    assuming a power - law dust spatial distribution for @xmath27 and @xmath29 , the best fit to the observed sed is provided by @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( see figure [ fig : silamc ] )  the density of dust _ increases _ outward from the star through the whole disk . since various studies suggest that the @xmath0 disk has an inner hole at @xmath34 and an outer edge sharply truncated at @xmath35 ( jura et al .  1993 ; jura et al .  1995 ; jayawardhana et al .  1998 ; koerner et al .  1998 ; schneider et al .  1999 ; wyatt et al .  1999 ; telesco et al .",
    "2000 ) , we also consider models with @xmath36 and @xmath37 . to obtain a satisfactory fit to the observed sed , an even steeper outward increase of dust distribution",
    "is needed ( for enhancing the amount of warm dust ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : silamc ] we also present the best - fit model spectrum for @xmath36 and @xmath37 obtained from @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we have also modelled the @xmath0 sed in terms of broken power - laws for both the dust spatial distribution and dust sizes : @xmath40 , @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "these 2-power - law models also require @xmath46 and we do not see significant improvements compared with single - power - law models .    motivated by the _",
    "( near - ir camera and multi - object spectrometer ) discovery that the surface brightness of the @xmath0 disk s scattered light sharply peaks at @xmath47 ( schneider et al .",
    "1999 ) , we adopt a gaussian function peaking at @xmath31 for the dust spatial distribution .",
    "as long as the fwhm @xmath48 , the bulk of the dust lies at @xmath49 and we expect little difference between the @xmath50 $ ] model and the @xmath51 $ ] model .",
    "therefore , for the gaussian - type distribution , we only consider @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ fig : silamc ] plots the best - fit spectrum calculated from @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the _ nicmos _ detection of a sharply bounded and narrow ( @xmath54 ) ring - like disk ( schneider et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "it is seen in figure [ fig : silamc ] that , although the dust spatial distributions are strikingly different , all three models are able to provide similarly good fits to the observed sed except the iras [ _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ] 60@xmath8 data ( we note that the iras photometric uncertainty given by augereau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) might have been underestimated [ beichman et al .  1989 ] ) , provided that the dust sizes are different .",
    "we have seen in  [ sec : spasize ] that pure solid silicate grains with various sizes and spatial distributions are successful in reproducing the sed of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath0 sed can also be fitted by pure solid amorphous carbon grains using the index of refraction of rouleau & martin ( 1991 ) . for illustration",
    ", we present in figure [ fig : silamc ] the best - fit single - power - law model spectrum calculated from @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . although it is unlikely that ( proto)planetary disk dust is mainly made of carbonaceous material , the observed sed _ alone _ is unable to rule out the pure carbon dust model unless the 9.7@xmath8 si - o and 18@xmath8 o - si - o features are detected .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the @xmath0 disk show that the thermal emission in the silicate feature is very weak ( sitko , lynch , & russell 2000 ) . ]",
    "we will discuss this further in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "jura et al .  (",
    "1998 ) argued that the @xmath0 disk are composed of cometary icy grains .",
    "the @xmath0 sed was closely reproduced by augereau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in terms of a cold interstellar dust component and a hot cometary dust component . in this section we also model the @xmath0 sed by cometary grains .",
    "following greenberg ( 1982 ) , we model cometary dust as fluffy aggregates of interstellar silicate and carbonaceous grains.o ( draine 1985 ) . ]",
    "we take the grain porosity ( the volume fraction of vacuum ) to be 0.6 ( augereau et al",
    ".  1999 ) .",
    "the volume ratio of the silicate component to the carbonaceous component is taken to be 1.0 as derived from the in situ measurement of the coma dust of comet halley ( kissel & krueger 1987 ) .",
    "we use mie theory and the bruggeman effective medium theory ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) to calculate the absorption cross sections for porous cometary grains .",
    "similar to the pure solid silicate dust model ( see  [ sec : spasize ] ) , the cometary dust model is also able to provide reasonably good fits to the @xmath0 sed with various dust sizes and dust spatial distributions . in figure",
    "[ fig : comet ] we show the model spectra calculated from cometary grains with a power - law size distribution and a power - law or gaussian spatial distribution : ( 1 ) @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 $ ] ; ( 2 ) @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 $ ] ; ( 3 ) @xmath53 , @xmath31 , @xmath63 and @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "it is shown in  [ sec : spasize ] and  [ sec : composition ] that models with various compositions , sizes , and spatial distributions are able to reproduce the observed sed of the @xmath0 disk reasonably well .",
    "it was also shown by jura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that icy grains with a typical radius near 100@xmath8 are able to explain the @xmath0 sed .",
    "dust thermal emission depends on its absorption and emission properties which are determined by its size and optical properties .",
    "it would not be surprising for a wide range of dust materials with properly chosen sizes to be able to fit the sed .",
    "however , we should not be too pessimistic : such spectrum will be useful when combined with other constraints on the composition of the dust in circumstellar disks around ( pre-)ms stars .",
    "the coagulation of interstellar grains that results in fluffy and inhomogeneous aggregates occurs in cold , dense molecular clouds and protostellar and protoplanetary dust disks and plays an important role in the formation of planetary systems ( weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) .",
    "we can therefore approximately derive the proportional composition of the dust in circumstellar disks from the abundances of the condensable elements ( c , n , o , si , fe , and mg ) , assuming protostellar activities impose little modification on protostellar grain compositions ( see beckwith , henning , & nakagawa 2000 ) .",

    "this will be discussed in detail in a subsequent paper ( a. li & j.i .",
    "lunine 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "the fact that pure amorphous carbon grains are also able to account for the observed sed ( see  [ sec : composition ] ) reinforces the importance of combining observations with theoretical calculations of dust composition in the context of the formation and evolution of dust disks .",
    "we note that the non - detection of the silicate emission features in the @xmath0 disk ( sitko et al .",
    "2000 ) does not necessarily imply the predominance of non - silicate dust in the disk .",
    "it may just imply the lack of small and hot silicate grains . on the other hand , the contradistinction between the various dust spatial distributions , which all provide a reasonably good fit to the observed sed ( see  [ sec : spasize ] and  [ sec : composition ] ) , indicates the importance of direct disk imaging .    in summary ,",
    "the spectral energy distributions of dust disks _ alone _ are not necessarily able to constrain the dust compositions , sizes , and spatial distributions .",
    "the dust spatial and size distributions are coupled .",
    "caution should be taken in discussing the presence / absence of planets , comets , and asteroids in the disk _ solely _ based on the observed sed .",
    "we argue that grains in circumstellar disk around ( pre-)ms stars are composed of silicate , carbonaceous dust ( and ices in cold regions ) and vacuum with a mixing ratio of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "a combination of compositional considerations , sed , mid - ir spectroscopy , coronagraphic near - ir imaging of scattered starlight and mid - ir imaging of dust thermal emission will allow us to better understand the properties of circumstellar dust disks .",
