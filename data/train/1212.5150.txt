    "the question of whether there is one universe or a collection of different ones in a multiverse is inherently inhomogeneous , and therefore requires any quantum cosmological treatment to go beyond the common minisuperspace constructions .",
    "it remains extremely difficult to address in theories such as loop quantum gravity , which do not yet give rise to reliable intuitive and tractable phenomena in anything but the simplest models .",
    "nevertheless , recent progress on effective descriptions of loop quantum gravity has revealed general , perhaps even universal , effects at high curvature , which can be used to test whether the theory makes it likely for the required structures of a multiverse to form . quite surprisingly , the cosmological scenarios based on these new results are entirely unlike anything that has been imagined in most homogeneous models of cosmology",
    ". some quantum - geometry effects can be so strong at high density that they trigger signature change , an implication which has been overlooked for several years because it can only be seen when inhomogeneity is implemented consistently .",
    "consequences for a possible multiverse are discussed in this article .",
    "in isotropic loop quantum cosmology @xcite , the wave function @xmath0 , in terms of a geometrical variable @xmath1 quantizing the spatial volume or the scale factor , can be extended to a universe before the big bang , according to a difference equation of the form @xmath2 following the recurrence , the wave function is evolved through @xmath3 , the classical singularity @xcite .",
    "departures not only from classical dynamics but also from the continuous wheeler  dewitt equation arise because there are strong `` holonomy modifications '' at nearly planckian density , to be discussed in more detail later in this article .",
    "these corrections provide the terms by which the difference operator on the left - hand side of ( [ modfried ] ) differs from a second - order derivative by @xmath1 as it appears in the wheeler  dewitt equation .",
    "if finite shifts in the difference operator are taylor - expanded , a series of higher - order corrections in the momentum of @xmath1 ( a curvature component ) is obtained @xcite .",
    "holonomy modifications therefore contribute to higher - curvature corrections expected in any quantum theory of gravity , but they lack higher time derivatives and therefore do not provide complete curvature terms .",
    "motivated by the use of holonomies instead of connection components in the full theory of loop quantum gravity , holonomy modifications replace the hubble parameter @xmath4 by a bounded function @xmath5 in a modified friedmann equation @xmath6 with an ambiguity parameter @xmath7 of the dimension of length ( possibly related to the planck length ) . using this modified friedmann equation ,",
    "one obtains in simple models an effective picture of singularity resolution given by a bounce @xcite : clearly , the energy density for solutions to ( [ modfried ] ) must always remain bounded .",
    "note that higher - order corrections in an expansion of @xmath8 are indeed of the same size as usually expected for higher - curvature corrections , given by the matter density divided by something close to the planck density .",
    "however , ( [ modfried ] ) ignores higher time derivatives which should be of similar size as they , too , contribute to higher curvature terms . as long as these terms are ignored",
    ", one can not use ( [ modfried ] ) at high density , near the maximum of the sine function , and it remains unclear whether loop quantum cosmology generically gives rise to bounces as an effective picture of its singularity resolution . in some models with specific matter content ( a free massless scalar or kinetic domination ) , one can show that higher time derivatives are absent or small @xcite .",
    "there is therefore a class of models in loop quantum cosmology in which the mechanism of singularity resolution can effectively be described as a bounce , and we will explore this scenario in more detail here . toward the end of the article , we will comment on the entropy problem @xcite which must be addressed in any bounce model .",
    "a bounce , in general terms , may give rise to a multiverse picture , using the following line of arguments : consider a collapsing ( part of the ) universe .",
    "inhomogeneity builds up as the universe evolves .",
    "if space is viewed as a patchwork of nearly homogeneous pieces , their size must be decreased after some time interval to maintain a good approximation , a mathematical process which can be seen as describing the dynamical fractionalization of space .",
    "these statements are true in any collapsing universe .",
    "if one uses a theory that gives rise to a bounce mechanism , denser patches that reach planckian density earlier bounce first ( assuming that homogeneous models are good for the patch evolution ) .",
    "these bounced patches appear as expanding regions embedded within a still - contracting neighborhood .",
    "given the opposite expansion behaviors , it is difficult to imagine that they can maintain causal contact with their neighborhood . a multiverse picture not unlike that of bubble nucleation in inflation results , except that there is no analog of `` bubbles within bubbles ''",
    "because a patch , once it has bounced , keeps expanding and diluting for a long time and would have to recollapse to trigger new bounces .",
    "another , independent mechanism that , too , starts with general properties of inhomogeneous collapse uses features of black holes : as inhomogeneity increases , black holes may form and grow .",

    "moreover , it is not clear whether it has a poincar - invariant vacuum ( or other ) state , or whether such a state would be the right base to expand around for , say , quantum cosmological phenomena .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use a procedure which is canonical , and at the same time general enough to encompass different quantum states .",
    "such a procedure @xcite can be found by turning ehrenfest s equations into systematic expansions .",

    "higher orders in the adiabatic expansion provide higher - derivative terms @xcite .",
    "the procedure sketched is the right basis to derive effective actions for canonical quantum systems .",
    "however , an application to quantum gravity requires additional extensions , most importantly one to include constraints or gauge properties , and to address the problem of time in the absence of an absolute evolution parameter such as the one used in ( [ x ] ) .",
    "also this extension is available at the canonical level @xcite and allows one to solve the problem of time , at least semiclassically @xcite .",
    "one could apply these techniques to a quantum version of the algebra ( [ dd])([hh ] ) , whose symmetry generators in the gauge theory of gravity are constraints .",
    "however , a last ingredient required for a successful implementation is still being developed : a generalization of canonical quantum mechanical effective methods to quantum field theories .    at present , it is therefore difficult to include quantum back - reaction in the algebra ( [ hh ] ) to see how it could be corrected .",
    "one expects higher time derivatives to arise from these corrections , as has been established for quantum - mechanical systems @xcite , and therefore quantum back - reaction contributes to higher - curvature terms .",
    "if the corrections are purely higher curvature , they do not change the hypersurface - deformation algebra .",
    "but common low - energy arguments stating that effective quantum back - reaction in gravity is of higher - curvature form assume that there is a poincar - invariant vacuum state to be expanded around . in non - perturbative quantum gravity , especially one with a discrete spatial structure such as loop quantum gravity , it is unlikely that there is any exactly poincar - invariant state .",
    "standard arguments for higher - curvature effective actions then break down , and in addition to curvature invariants there may well be other terms that modify the algebra ( [ hh ] ) , reflecting new space - time structures in the presence of discreteness .",
    "it is possible for quantum back - reaction to modify ( [ hh ] ) and compete with the quantum - geometry corrections of loop quantum gravity .",
    "inverse - triad corrections do not refer directly to the density or curvature scale and are therefore safe from competition by quantum back - reaction ; they can be discussed separately and bounded observationally .",
    "but holonomy corrections always compete with higher - curvature terms .    any holonomy modification of ( [ hh ] ) could , in principle , be undone by modifications due to quantum back - reaction .",
    "however , a more detailed look at how quantum back - reaction in constrained systems arises shows that whatever modification may be present , it can not remove all possible modifications by holonomy corrections .",
    "the reason for this is the form of degrees of freedom .",
    "holonomy corrections change even the dependence of hamiltonian ( constraints ) on expectation values ; they are modifications of the classical dynamics motivated by quantum geometry .",
    "quantum back - reaction gives rise to corrections that depend on moments of a state , as in ( [ v ] ) .",
    "if one computes poisson brackets of constraints corrected by quantum back - reaction , all correction terms will still depend on moments after taking the poisson bracket : moments are based on polynomial expressions in @xmath81 and @xmath82 , at least of second degree , and the poisson bracket of two polynomials of degree at least two is always a polynomial of degree at least two .",
    "quantum corrections of ( [ hh ] ) due to quantum back - reaction will therefore contain moments , while those due to holonomy corrections do not .",
    "quantum back - reaction can cancel holonomy modifications only for special states in which moments are strictly related to expectation values in a specific way .",
    "generically , these corrections , even though their magnitudes are similar , provide different terms that do not cancel each other . even in the absence of consistent versions of ( [ hh ] ) that include quantum back - reaction , it remains meaningful to study holonomy corrections and use their implications for quantum space - time structure , in the same spirit as already discussed for inverse - triad corrections .",
    "holonomy corrections give rise to a difference equation ( [ diff ] ) for the wave function , and imply strong modifications at high density .",
    "however , quantum back - reaction and higher - curvature corrections are both significant in the same regime , and therefore the high - curvature behavior of loop quantum cosmology remains uncertain .",

    "initial - value problems are ill - posed and there is no propagation of structure from collapse to expansion , as assumed in bounce models .",
    "expanding patches that may result are causally disconnected not just from their surrounding space - time , but also from their predecessor which was collapsing . instead of a bounce , loop quantum cosmology , once inhomogeneity is taken into account consistently , gives rise to a non - singular beginning of the expanding lorentzian phase we can observe . the transition from euclidean to lorentzian signature , when @xmath91 , is a natural place to pose initial conditions , for instance for an inflaton state .",
    "these initial values are unaware of what happened in the collapse phase , so that the picture of dense collapsing patches bouncing first is not realized .",
    "the new signature - change of loop quantum cosmology shares with bounces the combination of collapse with expansion , but the collapse phase does not deterministically affect the expansion phase . as a consequence , there is no entropy problem because no complete information is transmitted through high densities . and",

    "one may still view the possible collection of expanding universes within one space(-time ) , combining euclidean and lorentzian pieces , as a multiverse .",
    "however , any causal contact realized is even weaker than what is usually possible in multiverses , and it may seem more appropriate to talk of separate universes instead of one however connected larger structure .",
    "each of these expanding patches has its own beginning when space - time emerges by signature change from 4-dimensional space , giving it a clear status as a universe of its own .",
