    "random tessellations have attracted particular interest in stochastic geometry because of their wide applications ranging from classical geological problems to recent developments in telecommunication , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is one of the main purposes of the related theory to develop new classes of random tessellations that are mathematically tractable and yet rich enough in structure so that they may serve as new reference models for applications beside the classical poisson hyperplane and the poisson - voronoi tessellation .",
    "a very recent model , the so - called random stit tessellations  the abbreviation stit stands for * * st**able under * * it**eration , see below  was introduced by w. nagel and v. wei  in @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of these tessellations that distinguishes them from the above mentioned model classes is the property that their cells are not side - to - side , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this causes new geometric effects whose planar first - order properties in terms of mean values were explored in @xcite . +",
    "this paper will deal with second - order characteristics and central limit theory for the planar case , a topic that has been considered first by wei , ohser and nagel in @xcite and later also studied in @xcite , where beside other characteristics the variance of the total _ edge length _ was determined . here , in contrast",
    ", we will deal with second - order properties of the point process of _ vertices _ of the tessellation . to provide more general results",
    ", we will not restrict here to the class of stationary random iteration stable tessellations ( stit tessellations ) , and instead we will study the larger class of non - stationary random iteration infinitely divisible tessellations in the plane .",
    "they were introduced in @xcite as generalizations of stit tessellations and in section [ secstit ] we will recall their construction in the spirit of mecke - nagel - wei  ( mnw ) @xcite .",
    "it is an important observation that this spatio - temporal mnw - construction can be interpreted as a continuous time markov process on the space of tessellations , whence the general theory of markov processes is available . before extending some mean",
    "value relations from the stationary iteration stable to the non - stationary iteration infinitely divisible case in section [ secmv ] , we will formulate the main technical tools from the theory of markov processes in section [ secmart ] , on which our main results are based .",
    "they are the content of sections [ secvar ] and [ secclt ] .",
    "the variance of the total number of vertices and that of the total number of maximal edges in a bounded observation window will be calculated in section [ secvargen ] for very general driving measures , whereas in section [ secvariso ] we specialize to the motion - invariant case .",
    "the vertex pair - correlation measure for general line measures is considered in section [ secgenpcf ] and the considerations are specialized again to the stationary and isotropic setting in section [ secpcfiso ] .",
    "moreover , we determine in section [ secgenevpcf ] the exact cross - covariance measure of the vertex point process and the length measure in the general case and provide specialized formulas in section [ seccrosspcfiso ] for the stationary and isotropic regime . here , the most explicit formulas are available .",
    "another topic treated there concerns the variance asymptotics for a sequence @xmath3 of growing windows as @xmath4 tends to infinity . based on these results , section [ secclt ] deals with the central limit problem .",
    "it will be shown that a certain rescaled bivariate process of edge counts and edge lengths of a stationary random iteration stable ( stit ) tessellation converges to the process @xmath0 , where @xmath2 is a centered normal random variable with an explicitly known variance .",
    "+ we would like to emphasize that our results may be of interest in the context of statistical model fitting of random tessellations to real data , see @xcite .",
    "our central limit theory could be a base for statistical inference of tessellation models and related functionals , and asymptotic confidence intervals and statistical tests can be derived from them , since we make the first- and second - order moments explicitly available .",

    "are called the _ maximal edges _ ( in the related literature often called _ i - segments _ , as assuming shapes similar to that of the literal i ) of the tessellation @xmath23 and the family of all such edges is denoted by @xmath25 . note that such maximal edges can get further subdivided between their birth time and the time @xmath22 , that is to say in the course of the mnw dynamics there can appear additional vertices in their relative interiors .",
    "thus , we have a distinction between maximal edges with a possible interior structure and those edges which are not maximal ( for example the sides of cells or the primitive elements that are bounded by vertices but have no interior structure ) .",

    "the random tessellation @xmath23 is furthermore isotropic in a similar restriction - wise sense if and only if @xmath30 is the uniform distribution , i.e. if and only if @xmath6 is a multiple of the standard motion - invariant measure @xmath32 of unit length intensity on the space of lines in the plane , where @xmath33 is the uniform distribution on @xmath34 + we review now some of the important properties of the tessellations @xmath23 , proofs of which can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this implies the existence of the whole - plane tessellation @xmath39 such that @xmath40 for each compact convex @xmath41 2 .",
    "the mnw - construction satisfies the markov property with respect to _ iteration _ of tessellations in the time parameter @xmath22 , i.e @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the operation of iteration for whose exact definition we refer to the above mentioned papers .",
    "this operation can roughly be explained as follows : let @xmath44 be a random tessellation and let @xmath45 be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random tessellations in the plane .",
    "to each cell @xmath46 of the _ frame tessellation _",
    "@xmath44 we associate the tessellation @xmath47 .",
    "now , we make a local superposition of @xmath44 and the cutouts of @xmath47 in each cell @xmath46 of the frame tessellation .",
    "if we let @xmath48 be a tessellation with the same distribution as @xmath47 for any @xmath49 , we denote the outcome of this procedure of local superposition by @xmath50 and call it the _ iteration _ of @xmath44 with @xmath48 .",
    "it directly follows from the above markov property that the random tessellations @xmath23 are infinitely divisible with respect to iteration , i.e. @xmath51 for any @xmath52 and any compact convex @xmath14 . for this reason , the tessellations @xmath23",
    "are referred to as _ iteration infinitely divisible random tessellations_. however , it is worth pointing out that it is currently not known whether _ any _ iteration infinitely divisible random tessellation can be obtained by the mnw - construction .",
    "if in addition the driving measure @xmath6 is translation invariant , it can be verified that @xmath23 is even stable under iteration , i.e. @xmath53 where @xmath54 means the dilation with a factor @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 . note that this equation must be understood symbolically , since properly the operation of iteration involves a sequence of independent and identically distributed random tessellations , but we adopt here the usual convention from the earlier work @xcite .",

    "as already seen in the introduction above , the mnw - construction of iteration infinitely divisible or iteration stable random tessellations @xmath23 in finite volumes @xmath5 for general locally finite and diffuse driving measures @xmath6 enjoys the markov property in the continuous time parameter @xmath24 in our previous work @xcite we have used this fact combined with the classical theory of martingale problems for pure jump markov processes to construct a class of natural martingales associated to the mnw process . in this paper",
    "we only need a part of that theory . to formulate the required results , for a bounded and measurable functional @xmath65 of a line segment ( tessellation edge ) and for a tessellation @xmath66 usually taken to be a realization of @xmath23 for some @xmath67 write @xmath68 note ,",
