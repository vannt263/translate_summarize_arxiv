    "since the beginning of the 21st century , the spectroscopy of spin noise  @xcite has emerged as a competitive tool to study spin dynamics in close to thermal equilibrium conditions .",
    "the rapid development of this technique has started with detailed investigations of the spin fluctuations in atomic gases in 2004 @xcite , and then moved to studies of spin noise in semiconductor systems , such as bulk crystals  @xcite or nanostructures  @xcite , because this class of materials may be the building blocks of future spin - based devices .",
    "for many applications , self - assembled semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have been considered , because qds can be grown epitaxially and implemented into established semiconductor environment  @xcite .",
    "the direct band gap in combination with a giant optical dipole moment allows for spin control operations that can be performed at a terahertz rate or even faster , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . to that end , it is mandatory for such applications to have detailed knowledge on the interactions of the involved carrier spins and the resulting dynamics .",
    "the spin dynamics of the confined spins of single electrons and holes are mostly determined by the interaction with the surrounding nuclei in the dot , which are theoretically treated usually by the central spin model  ( csm ) .",
    "first experimental investigations on the spin noise of singly - charged qds were undertaken by crooker _",
    "et al . _",
    "further studies on such qds included , for example , the observation of the hole spin decoupling from the surrounding nuclei on the fluctuation level  @xcite .",
    "another achievement was related with the investigation of hole spin noise correlations probed by two beams in a two - colour optical spin noise technique , making it possible to reveal the homogeneous lifetime of the optical transition in the dot , despite the inevitable inhomogeneous broadening of the qd ensemble  @xcite . however , until now the objects of investigation of the spin noise in quantum dot ensembles were , to the best of our knowledge , resident hole spins only .",
    "if at all , electrons were additionally excited by a weak non - resonant pump laser , by which the spin fluctuations of the optically excited electron spins became observable  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the lack of comprehensive experimental investigations of the electron spin noise in @xmath0-doped quantum dots , theoretical treatments do already exist .",
    "two complementary approaches , based on a semiclassical treatment utilizing the bloch equations and averaging over the static nuclear spin fluctuations  @xcite , and a fully quantum mechanical approach that is based on the chebyshev polynomial technique  @xcite , lead to almost identical predictions of spin noise spectra  @xcite .",
    "this work aims at a detailed experimental and theoretical investigation of resident electron and hole spin fluctuations in qd ensembles .",
    "we present experimental results on these fluctuations in absence of external fields , where the electron spin precession around overhauser field fluctuations is revealed .",
    "we also demonstrate comparable time scales for long - term spin decoherence in @xmath0- and @xmath1-type qds .",
    "this result , being unexpected within the simple csm , is explained by the inclusion of nuclear quadrupole interactions  @xcite .",
    "further , we study the behaviour of the spin noise under application of transverse and longitudinal static fields . we demonstrate that , like in the case of hole spins  @xcite , the electron spins also undergo decoupling from the nuclear spins .",
    "this effect takes place at somewhat stronger longitudinal fields , demonstrating a stronger coupling to the surrounding bath of nuclei .",

    "in optical spin noise spectroscopy , spin fluctuations are monitored as noise in the faraday or kerr rotation of a continuous - wave ( cw ) linearly polarized laser beam .",
    "the fluctuation angles @xmath2 ( faraday effect , transmission geometry ) and @xmath3 ( kerr effect , reflection geometry ) are proportional to the spontaneous fluctuations of the charge carrier spins .",
    "the autocorrelation functions of the spin signals are proportional to the correlation functions of electron and hole spin-@xmath4 components , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with the @xmath7 $ ] axis being the direction of the probe beam propagation coinciding with the quantum dot growth axis  @xcite .",
    "we consider an ensemble of electronically isolated quantum dots ( qds ) in an external static magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "each qd can be charged either with an electron or a heavy hole . as a result , it is sufficient to calculate the spin fluctuation of a charge carrier within a dot and afterwards average over the quantum dot distribution . since the qds are independent of each other , the cross - correlations between the spins in different qds are negligible .",
    "further , no correlation between electron and hole spins appears , see refs .",

    "the spectrum is an even function of @xmath15 . as a result , for a qd ensemble one obtains the following expression for the faraday rotation fluctuation spectrum : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constants which depend on the details of the studied sample , the radiation propagation geometry and the probe frequency  @xcite .",

    "therefore , certain simplifications and model approaches are usually engaged , which provide complementary information on spin noise . these approaches ,",
    "their areas of validity and the corresponding results are briefly summarized below .",

    ".   demonstrates two peaks at @xmath73 in general  @xcite .",
    "the peak at positive frequencies is related with the spin precession . at sufficiently small fields ( @xmath74 )",
    "its position is determined by the characteristic frequency of spin precession in the field of nuclear spin fluctuations , @xmath75 , whereas at high fields ( @xmath76 ) it is determined by the larmor frequency @xmath77 of the spin precession about the external field .",
    "the shape of the precession peak is determined by the distribution function of the random nuclear fluctuations .",
    "the peak at @xmath78 in the noise spectrum is caused by the spin components conserved during precession  @xcite . in the semiclassical model outlined above",
    "this peak obeys a lorentzian shape with the half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) being @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , the semiclassical treatment with frozen nuclear spins fails to accurately describe the low - frequency behavior of the spin noise , since at low frequencies @xmath80 the nuclear dynamics becomes important . generally , to describe the features of the spin noise spectrum at low frequencies , a quantum mechanical treatment as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantum ] is needed . before explaining this treatment in detail we briefly address some situations in which the semiclassical approach can be used .",
    "basically , the semiclassical treatment can be applied to study the spin noise at low frequencies @xmath80 if the electron ( hole ) feedback on the nuclear spin dynamics can be neglected . hence , the temporal evolution of electron ( hole ) and nuclear fluctuations are decoupled in eq .  .",
    "however , the dynamics of the nuclear spins can be included into consideration also . in this situation , the electron spin precesses , in addition to the static external field , in a time - dependent nuclear field @xmath81 .",
    "this can be realized in a semiclassical treatment if the electron or the hole leaves its site of localization before nuclear spin precession takes place , i.e. due to hopping to a neighbouring empty qd or due to excitation to the wetting layer and consequent localization in another dot  @xcite .",
    "then the nuclear fields can be treated as gaussian random functions with correlation time @xmath82 , and analytical expressions for the spin noise spectrum can be derived , as shown in ref .",
    "another regime where the semiclassical approach can be still employed is the case of strong quadrupolar splittings of the nuclear spin states , @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "in this case one can find all temporal correlations of the nuclear fields , i.e. second order , @xmath84 , and higher order correlators , from the quadrupolar hamiltonian   and then evaluate the electron ( hole ) spin noise spectra semiclassically from the bloch equations for the electron spin dynamics in a time - dependent magnetic field .",
    "provided that the correlation time @xmath82 is finite but long enough , @xmath85 , the spin noise spectrum is described by eq .   with some `` effective '' spin relaxation @xmath79 , which may be magnetic field dependent",
    "particularly , at @xmath86 one has @xmath87",
    "@xcite .",
    "the inaccurate description of the zero - frequency peak in the semiclassical approach can be avoided using the quantum mechanical definition of the spin correlation functions , eq .  , which we evaluate by applying the chebyshev polynomial expansion technique ( cet ) .",
    "it was originally developed as a numerical tool to calculate the exact time evolution @xmath88 of an arbitrary , originally pure state @xmath89 in a well defined time interval @xmath90  @xcite .",
    "as recently demonstrated  @xcite , it can also be applied to evaluate correlation functions as @xmath91 by using the quantum typicality of random quantum states  @xcite .",
    "the spin noise spectrum due to precession of electrons in the overhauser field at zero external magnetic field , calculated by this quantum mechanical approach agrees well with the semiclassical result , eq .  , and is only determined by the second moment @xmath62 of the distribution function for the @xmath37 , i.  e.  eq . , and , if applied , by the external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the zero - frequency peak or more precisely the low - frequency spin noise peak in the noise spectrum is governed by the interplay of the electron or hole feedback on the nuclear spin dynamics , the non - uniformity of the hyperfine interaction  @xcite and the nuclear quadrupolar couplings  @xcite .",
    "this interplay between the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath72 , @xmath48 , @xmath92 and @xmath49 of the hamiltonian   has significant impact on the shape of the spin noise spectrum at small frequencies .",
    "a detailed discussion on the choice of the hyperfine coupling constants @xmath37 used in the cet can be found in ref .",
    "the parameters associated with the quadrupolar interaction are derived from recent microscopic studies of the electric field gradients in ( in , ga)as quantum dots  @xcite assuming an in concentration of @xmath93 .",
    "although we only can include a small amount , @xmath94 , of spin-@xmath95 nuclei in the quantum mechanical simulation , we generate the coupling constants @xmath48 and the orientation vectors @xmath96 from a distribution function reproducing the average values found in the microscopic study by c.  bulutay  @xcite .",

    "we have averaged over 50 different configurations of @xmath103 and @xmath48 distributions with a fixed @xmath62 and @xmath104 .",
    "so far , we have only discussed the modeling of a single ( in , ga)as qd by the cet . since the experimental measurements are performed on an ensemble of qds , the averaging over the variations of the hyperfine field parameters should be implemented as noted in sec .",

    "the blue shift in case of the p - doped sample , on the other hand , may result from a double charging of the low energy dots with a pair of holes forming a spin zero singlet state . towards the high energy side single resident hole spin charging occurs in the dots , resulting in an increase of spin noise .",

    "the laser is then guided through a single mode optical fiber for spatial mode shaping ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "after a glan - taylor polarizer providing a linear extinction ratio of 10@xmath110 , the beam is transmitted through the sample with a large area focus of 100  micrometers diameter , in order to minimize optical excitation effects in the qd ensemble  @xcite .",
    "detection of the faraday rotation noise is done with a standard polarimeter , consisting of a wollaston prism and a broadband optical balanced detector .",
    "two different detectors are used to study slower and faster dynamics : one has a bandwidth of 40 khz @xmath111 650 mhz ( new focus 1607-ac ) requiring optical powers of typically a few milliwatts ( _ fast _ detector ) , while the other one ( femto hca - s ) covers a bandwidth of dc @xmath111 100 mhz , requiring powers of a few hundreds of microwatts ( _ slow _ detector ) .",
    "the output of the detectors is amplified and low - pass filtered at variable cutoff frequencies to avoid undersampling , and then sent to the input of a digitizer .",
    "the digitizer incorporates field programmable gate array ( fpga ) technology for real time computation of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the digitized voltage samples .",
    "the maximum bandwidth is limited at 1ghz , providing 16384 spectral lines at a spectral resolution of 61.04 khz . if necessary , the bandwidth can be reduced down to 200 mhz with a resolution of 12.21 khz . for even higher resolution",
    "as required , e.g. , in the case of zero and longitudinal magnetic field measurements , spectra could be also acquired with a pcie digitizer card installed in a computer , in combination with multicore fft processing and averaging . in this work , the signal accumulation times varied between 1 minute and 30 minutes , depending on the overall noise signal amplitude .    figure  [ wav ] shows , in addition to the pl spectra discussed above , the integrated spin noise power , i.e. the area under the spin noise power density spectrum ( sns ) , @xmath112 , as function of the probe wavelength for both samples .",
    "the spin noise power nearly follows the pl line , with maxima at 889 nm for the @xmath0-type sample and at 896 nm for the @xmath1-type sample .",
    "this is the typical behaviour for inhomogeneously broadened ensembles  @xcite .",
    "thus the laser is tuned into the absorption band to provide measurable noise signal .    using electromagnets we are able to apply magnetic fields , in the longitudinal direction ( faraday geometry , along the growth direction of the sample ) up to @xmath113 = 120 mt and in the transverse direction ( voigt geometry ) up to @xmath114 = 350 mt . in order to remove the spin - independent contribution to @xmath115 from the overall photon shot noise and the intrinsic electronic noise",

    "this difference shall be studied in greater detail in future , here we point out only some related aspects .",
    "first , as has been already mentioned above , there is a finite fraction of @xmath1-doped qds in the intentionally @xmath0-doped sample , which amounts to about 20 % . since at zero external field @xmath139 of the electron spin noise",
    "is concentrated in the precession peak and only @xmath138 contributes to the zero - frequency peak , holes then may contribute up to 40 % to the spin noise of the zero - frequency peak , while the remaining 60 % stems from electrons .",
    "thus , there is a significant hole contribution that may influence spectral shape and amplitude of the low - frequency sns from the @xmath0-doped sample .",
    "second , both samples are measured under exactly the same probing conditions , especially with the same large laser spot of 100@xmath63 m that evidently produces only a weak perturbation of the spin system .",
    "we prove this assumption by additionally looking at the fr noise amplitude , which is the square root of the fr noise power , obtained by integration of the sns from 0.012mhz to 32mhz . taking the dependence of the fr noise amplitude on the probe laser power",
    ", we obtain an exponent of @xmath151 for both samples by fitting the dependence with a power law .",
    "this value is quite close to unity , suggesting that the measurements were carried out close to thermal equilibrium , i.e. , close to the non - perturbative regime  @xcite . as an example of the opposite case , ref",
    ".  @xcite showes signatures of strong optical perturbation , demonstrating the hole spin noise in a qd microcavity with the measurements carried out using @xmath152 times larger probe intensity than in our case .",
    "the linewidth then is increased by a factor of 3 , i.e. by 200 % under a threefold increase of laser power .",
    "this additionally corroborates that our measurements are performed largely non - perturbatively .    using the well - known relation @xmath153",
    "we derive the effective spin lifetimes .",
    "we obtain @xmath154 = 0.46  @xmath63s for the @xmath1-doped sample , and @xmath155 = 0.41  @xmath63s for the @xmath0-doped sample .",
    "these values are close to the known result of @xmath156 = 0.4  @xmath63s that was obtained in the refs .",
    "@xcite . at first glance",
    "it is quite surprising that electrons and holes have similar relaxation times , as they show a strong difference in the nuclear interaction strength .",

    "our observation of comparable timescales is related to the presence of additional quadrupolar interactions of the nuclei with electric field gradients in the dots , eq .  .",
    "without @xmath158 , the characteristic time scale for the electron spin noise is given by @xmath159 , and the one for hole spins by @xmath160 determined by the fluctuations of the overhauser field . while @xmath161 ns is found in the typical qd ensembles as investigated here ,",
    "the @xmath1-wave nature of the hole - wave function reduces the hyperfine couplings @xmath162 by a factor of 10 compared to the electron spins @xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath163 is additionally suppressed by the anisotropy parameter @xmath164 , accounting for the anisotropic dipole - dipole coupling of hole spins to the nuclear spins @xcite , so that @xmath165 .",
    "including a realistic modeling @xcite of the coupling between the nuclei s quadrupole moments and the electric field gradients ( efgs ) in the qds via @xmath158 is sufficient to explain the observed mismatch between the experiments and the prediction of the csm , see also ref .",
    "this can be intuitively understood : adding an additional source of decoherence ( i.e.  the quadrupole interaction ) to the csm hamiltonian results in a decrease of the coherence time of the considered electron / hole spins .    without @xmath158 , the total spin component in @xmath4-direction ,",

    "we note that the influence of @xmath158 onto the decay of the electronic spin is indirect and only occurs in combination with the hyperfine interaction .",
    "its effect is non - universal and can not be casted into a simple decay time or energy scale as defined by the fluctuation of the overhauser field .",
    "the reason is related to its two opposite limits . for @xmath173 , typically relevant for the experiment , @xmath158 provides additional nuclear spin - flip processes leading to an additional spin decay at long time scales set by @xmath104 , eq .  , as outlined above .",
    "for the opposite limit , @xmath174 , the nuclear system must be diagonalized first , providing a set of two time - reversal doublets as the new eigenbasis for each nuclear spin energetically separated by @xmath175 . then the coupling to the electron / hole spin",
    "is treated perturbatively , and the rigidity of the nuclear system can suppress additional dephasing for @xmath176 @xcite .    since the @xmath177 have different strain induced orientations at each nuclei in a real qd , their angular distribution @xcite and the in - plane anisotropy @xmath49 , however , provide an additional source of randomness and , hence , spin dephasing even for stronger hyperfine coupling due to the misalignment of the local nuclear easy - axis and the growth orientation , defining the global @xmath4-axis .",
    "crucial for the understanding of the comparable long - time spin decay of electron spins and hole spins is the fact that @xmath178 is caused by the growth induced strain in the qds , and its energy scale is consequently independent of the qd doping .",
    "this additional source of decoherence counteracts the lifetime enhancement of a factor @xmath179 as predicted within the csm for hole spins .",

    "the transversal magnetic field reduces the non - decaying fraction of the spin - correlation function responsible for the zero - frequency @xmath108-peak in the spin - noise spectrum .",

    "the suppression of the precession peak in the @xmath0-doped sample then becomes indirectly observable by changes of the integral spectral area of the zero - frequency peak , as for higher longitudinal fields the spins become stabilized and redistributed in frequency into the zero - peak component .    figure  [ lonspec ] shows the low - frequency sns of the @xmath0-type sample , panel ( a ) , and of the @xmath1-type sample , panel ( b ) , measured at 0.2 mw probe laser power for different values of the longitudinal magnetic field .",

    "this indicates a crossover to a @xmath205 spin decay in time , which is especially noteworthy for the @xmath0-doped sample , since the longitudinal field redistributes electron spin fluctuations from the overhauser precession peak into the zero - frequency peak ( see below ) , such that at the maximum applied field strength the electron spin contribution to the zero - frequency peak clearly dominates , despite the finite admixture from @xmath1-doped qds .",
    "thus , the crossover to @xmath204-noise can be termed a general property of carrier spins in qds , regardless of the type of resident carrier charge .    to obtain deeper insight into the complex dynamics of interacting electron and nuclear spins we extract again the effective spin relaxation times @xmath206 from the half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the zero - frequency sns component ,",

    "notably , the width of the dip in the magnetic field dependence of the electron spin lifetime around zero field should be considerably larger than that for holes .",
    "this is because the hyperfine field acting on the electron spin is stronger .",
    "hence , a larger external magnetic field is needed to overcome the hyperfine field .",
    "this assumption is supported by the spin lifetime behaviour @xmath210 observed for the @xmath0-doped sample , see black dots in fig .",

    "@xcite provide this mechanism : the quadrupolar splittings defined by the hamiltonian @xmath243 are induced during the growth process  @xcite and are independent of doping . moreover , since the nuclear magnetic moment is about 2000 times smaller than the bohr magneton , the nuclear system remains almost unaffected by the comparably weak longitudinal magnetic fields applied in our experiments .",
    "replacing the non - decaying fraction of the spin - correlation function  @xcite by the integral over the low - frequency part of the spectrum yields the same functional dependence of this signal area on the longitudinal magnetic field as in eq . for @xmath0-type qds .",

    "for the @xmath86 spectrum we supplemented a lorentzian ( dash - dotted line ) with a half width at half maximum of @xmath258 . , width=321 ]    with this specific conclusion",
    "we turn the analysis to the @xmath1-type qds .",
    "the situation here is considerably different from the @xmath0-type qds : due to the significant anisotropy factor @xmath259 , the spin decay is suppressed in the csm : the gaussian peak from the overhauser field fluctuation is shifted to lower frequencies approximately by a factor of @xmath260  @xcite compared to @xmath0-type qds and , therefore , merges with the rest of the low frequency spectrum , as was also shown in fig .",

    "in addition , its area is reduced due to the suppression of the spin decay via the hyperfine coupling . to this end , the depicted frequency range in fig .",
    "[ lonspec](a ) contains almost the complete spin noise , and , consequently , the area remains constant within the experimental restrictions as reported in fig .",
    "[ arealifetime](b ) and in accordance with the spectral sum rule .    for a detailed comparison between the experiment and the cet approach for the full hamiltonian  , the frequency resolution for the sns must be matched .",
    "since we have typically used a fixed number of chebyshev polynomials @xmath261 , and the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian increases with increasing magnetic field , the lowest accessible frequency in the cet approach also increases with the applied magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the cet has very reliable access to the high - frequency part of the spectrum above 1 mhz , while that part on the experimental side is unfortunately already disappearing in the detector noise . on the other hand",
    ", the cet approach lacks the necessary low - frequency resolution for @xmath262 1 mhz with increasing longitudinal magnetic field , where the crossover to a @xmath204-type spin decay has been detected in experiment as reported above .",
    "nevertheless , such a crossover has also been found in a longitudinal magnetic field when applying the cet approach to the full hamiltonian for @xmath1-typed qds .",
    "for the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - holes ] , however , we have used slightly different parameters than in fig .",
    "[ zf ] enabling us to reach lower frequencies . setting aside the increased experimental noise , the qualitative and quantitative agreement remains remarkable between theory and experiment : ( i ) with increasing magnetic field , the spectral weight is reduced above 0.1 mhz and transferred to frequencies below 0.1 mhz so that the sns approaches the @xmath204 asymptotic in the depicted interval , and ( ii ) all spectra cross each other at about @xmath263 0.1 - 0.15 mhz . due to the incompatibility of the experimental and theoretical frequency resolution in longitudinal magnetic fields we provide fig .",
    "[ fig - holes ] as a proof of principle only and leave a more detailed parameter fit of the hamiltonian to the experimental data depicted in fig .",
    "[ lonspec ] to the next generation of high power computers .",
    "we have applied spin noise spectroscopy to measure the spin lifetimes of qd electrons and holes in zero and finite magnetic fields .",
    "both types of charge carriers demonstrate a similar change of the sns shape in longitudinal magnetic field , from about lorentzian to @xmath204 dependence , as they become stabilized along the field .",
    "our findings demonstrate that the spin noise in longitudinal fields allows for a clear separation of electron and hole spin contributions in qd ensembles and , correspondingly , the determination of their spin lifetimes due to the difference of their interaction strength with the nuclear spin fluctuations .",
    "transverse magnetic fields allow one to define the fractions of electron and hole spin subensembles within a given sample .",
    "the experimental data have been discussed in the framework of two complementary theoretical approaches : the chebyshev polynomial expansion technique ( cet ) which provides a fully quantum treatment of the spin noise problem and the semi - classical approximation ( sca ) which is based on the separation of the electron and nuclear spin dynamics .",
    "the applicability of these approaches is evaluated for the different studied experimental configurations .",
    "comparison of the experimental data with the modeling shows that the cet approach is a powerful method to describe the spectral sns shape in the intermediate and high frequency ranges .",
    "the limitations of this method are given only by the computational power that apply in our case to frequencies below 0.1mhz .",
    "an additional advantage of the cet is given by the rigorous inclusion of quadrupolar splittings of the nuclei which provides a quantitative explanation of the similar long - time / low - frequency spin dynamics for both types of carriers .",
    "on the other hand , the sca enables one to elaborate an intuitive and consistent qualitative picture of the spin dynamics and spin fluctuations .",
    "this approach has its limitations at very low frequencies to describe the shape of the zero - frequency peak .",
    "however , it gives a good qualitative description of the overall spin noise spectra using simplified assumptions and a high quantitative precision for the high frequency part of the spectra .",
    "this method can serve to estimate the parameters of the hyperfine interaction and the @xmath29-factors of electrons and holes from the experimental data which then can serve as input into a more advanced quantum mechanical approach .",
