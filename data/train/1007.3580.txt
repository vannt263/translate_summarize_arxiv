    "precise predictions for signals and backgrounds at high energy colliders are required to be able to identify and study new physics in current experiments .",
    "processes with multi - particle final states will play a significant role in this task , in particular at the lhc , which emphasises the need for predictions at next - to - leading order  ( nlo ) for such  processes .",
    "one of the challenges of nlo calculations is the numerically stable evaluation and integration of the virtual corrections .",
    "both the development of new unitarity based methods and the improvement of traditional methods based on feynman diagrams have led to important new nlo results , in particular to physical predictions for @xmath0 processes at hadron colliders  @xcite .",
    "a recent overview can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "as these calculations are technically involved , it is important to spend some effort on two features : _ automatisation _ and _",
    "modularity_. the latter allows for a combination of automated programs to calculate the virtual corrections with existing tools for tree level matrix element generation , phase space integration and automated tools for the subtraction of soft / collinear singularities from real radiation via a standard interface  @xcite .",
    "the golem approach to the calculation of one - loop amplitudes puts particular emphasis on automatisation , as the setup can be used for massless as well as massive particles and all types of spin structures .",
    "the feynman diagrammatic approach implies that the rational parts of the amplitudes can be evaluated at no extra cost .",
    "the reduction of the tensor integrals is done semi - numerically , thus avoiding large algebraic expressions . a special choice of the integral basis preserves numerical stability in phase space regions with small gram determinants .",
    "more details about the method are given in sections [ sec : golem : algorithm ] and  [ sec : golem : golem95 ] .",
    "the golem method in combination with automated tools for the real radiation part has been used to obtain results for e.g. @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which will be described in sections [ sec : golem:4b ] and [ sec : golem : vvj ] .",
    "for the consistent description of a cross - section for a @xmath4 particle process at nlo one needs to include the square of the tree level matrix element @xmath5 , the real emission of an additional massless particle @xmath6 and the virtual corrections consisting of the interference term of one - loop and tree - level diagrams of the @xmath4 process , @xmath7    the golem project focuses on the efficient and numerically stable computation of the virtual corrections , as the other contributions can be added by interfacing with existing tools through a well defined generic interface  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop amplitude @xmath8 is represented as the helicity projections of a sum of feynman diagrams .",
    "each diagram @xmath9 contributes to one or more colour structures and can be written as a sum over tensor integrals : @xmath10 in our standard approach we use a lorentz invariant decomposition of the tensor integrals to separate the tensor structure from the associated integral form factors .",
    "the fully contracted tensor structure is expressed in terms of spinor products and the constants of the physics model , whereas the feynman parameter integrals are expressed in terms of form factors which can either be reduced further or be evaluated numerically .",
    "an implementation of these form factors is available in the library ` golem95 ` .",
    "@xcite    as an alternative approach one provides the numerator function @xmath11 where @xmath12 , as an input to some reduction at the integrand level  @xcite , where @xmath13 is evaluated for different numerical values of @xmath14 and the four dimensional , complex vector @xmath15 .",
    "the reduction of one - loop integrals follows an algorithm which has been developed in  @xcite , valid for an arbitrary number of legs and both massive and massless particles .",
    "the ultraviolet and infrared divergences are regulated by dimensional regularisation .",
    "this algorithm has been implemented as a ` fortran95 ` library , ` golem95 ` , for integrals with up to six external momenta  @xcite .",
    "the library is publicly available at ` lappweb.in2p3.fr/lapth/golem/golem95.html ` , together with detailed documentation and example programs .",
    "the algebraic reduction of higher rank four - point and three - point functions to expressions containing only scalar integrals necessarily leads to inverse gram determinants appearing in the coefficients of those scalar integrals .",
    "these determinants can become arbitrarily small in some phase space regions and can therefore hamper a numerically stable evaluation of the one - loop amplitude upon phase space integration . in order to deal with such situations in an automated way ,",
    "our algorithm is able to avoid the occurrence of inverse gram determinants completely .",
    "this is done by testing the value of the determinant and , in the case when it is smaller than a certain value , stopping the reduction _ before _ such inverse determinants are generated . in these cases ,",
    "the tensor integrals , corresponding to integrals with feynman parameters in the numerator , are evaluated by means of numerical integration .",
    "the use of one - dimensional integral representations guarantees a fast and stable  evaluation . for integrals with internal masses ,",
    "the option to evaluate the tensor integrals numerically prior to reduction , in regions where the gram determinant tends to zero , is not yet supported , but is under construction . for the ir finite scalar box and triangle functions with internal masses",
    ", we use the expressions from the program oneloop  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of an option to allow complex masses is underway .    to summarise , the library contains the following features :    * all tensor coefficients up to rank six six - point integrals , for massless as well as massive integrals * all scalar boxes , triangles , bubbles , tadpoles * boxes in @xmath16 dimensions up to rank three ( @xmath17 ) and in @xmath18 dimensions up to rank one , and triangles in @xmath16 dimensions up to rank one ( larger ranks of the higher dimensional integrals are not needed in the reduction ) . * automated detection of small gram determinants and fast ( one - dimensional ) numerical integration of tensor integrals to avoid the occurrence of small inverse determinants * option to calculate the rational parts only .",
    "for the automated construction of the matrix elements we have developed a package ( ` golem-2.0 `  @xcite ) combining ` qgraf `  @xcite as a diagram generator with the symbolic manipulation program ` form `  @xcite for the algebraic simplification of the generated amplitude .",
    "the expressions for the helicity projections of each diagram contributing to the process are further processed by ` haggies `  @xcite to produce optimised ` fortran95 ` code for a fast numerical evaluation .",
    "a large part of the infrastructure and the user interface is implemented as a ` python ` program .    for the reduction of the tensor integrals ` golem-2.0 ` supports two choices .",
    "one can express the amplitude in terms of integral form factors as defined in  @xcite and implemented in ` golem95 `  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the program can generate the numerator of each feynman diagram in a form suitable as input for ` samurai `  @xcite .",
    "for each of the two options the amount of human intervention is limited to setting up an appropriate configuration file .    in order to further improve the applicability of the program we are currently implementing an interface to feynrules  @xcite model files .",
    "interoperability with existing monte carlo programs will be achieved by providing an interface conforming to the binoth - les houches accord  @xcite and some additional functionality to provide the relevant information about the matrix element to the ` powheg box `  @xcite .",
    "the described features offer a great flexibility to the potential user ; the achieved performance of the matrix element code and its modularity allow for a wide range of applications .",
    "we have used the setup described in section  [ sec : golem : golem20 ] for generating a ` fortran95 ` implementation of the one - loop matrix element for the process @xmath1",
    "@xcite , which is one of the channels of the full @xmath19 cross - section at the lhc .",
    "the qcd induced contribution to the @xmath20-signature constitutes an important background for higgs searches in the mssm , where for certain parameter regions the heavy higgs boson decays predominantly into @xmath21  pairs  @xcite . also outside the framework of the mssm interesting physics scenarios such as certain _ hidden valley _",
    "models lead to collider signatures with many @xmath22-quarks  @xcite .",
    "we have ensured the correctness of our one - loop matrix element by comparison to a second , independent setup using feynarts  @xcite , ` form `  @xcite and maple as a tool chain .",
    "integrated results have been obtained by three different setups :    * the virtual matrix element obtained from ` golem-2.0 ` has been used as a stand - alone program to reweight unweighted leading order events generated by ` whizard `  @xcite .",
    "all tree like parts and the infrared subtraction terms as defined in  @xcite using a slicing parameter  @xcite have been implemented in  ` whizard ` . *",
