    "compact , off - nuclear x - ray point sources in nearby galaxies , with luminosities @xmath4 are referred to as ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "detected in the early 1980 s , with the _ einstein _ x - ray satellite @xcite , these objects were further studied with _ rosat _ @xcite and _ asca _ @xcite .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ x - ray observatories with their significantly higher angular resolution , dramatically confirmed the presence of ulxs @xcite , and have enabled their spectral and temporal properties to be studied in detail ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "the observed luminosities of ulxs exceed the eddington limit for a @xmath5 black hole .",
    "since ulx are off - nuclear sources , their masses must be @xmath6 from dynamical friction arguments @xcite . thus",
    ", ulx may represent a class of intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) whose mass range ( @xmath7 ) lies between that of stellar mass black holes and super - massive black holes observed in galaxy centers @xcite .",
    "alternatively , ulx may be stellar mass black hole systems exhibiting super - eddington accretions with their radiation geometrically beamed @xcite .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy has provided supporting evidence in favor of imbhs of @xmath8 in ulxs @xcite .",
    "moreover , x - ray timing characteristics , i.e. presence of low frequency qpos and/or breaks in the power density spectra , also suggests that ulx may harbor @xmath9-@xmath10 black holes @xcite .",
    "while indicative these results are not conclusive , since there are also several arguments against imbhs in ulxs ( see e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and further investigations are required to reveal the true nature of these sources .",
    "study of the host galaxy properties of ulxs reveals that their number and total x - ray luminosity is related to recent star formation activity , suggesting that they originate in young short - lived systems @xcite . while the number of ulxs per galaxy is roughly the same for both spirals and ellipticals , the ones in the spirals have significantly higher luminosities @xcite .",
    "optical counterparts have been reported for some ulx @xcite . while some of the counterparts have been identified as o stars @xcite , for most ulxs , the optical counterparts are stellar clusters @xcite . however , for many ulx , the optical counterparts reveal that they are either background agn @xcite or foreground stars .",
    "ulxs found in elliptical galaxies may have contamination from background sources at @xmath11% level @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of x - ray sources in general and their connection with globular clusters have been undertaken @xcite who note that the x - ray properties of the the sources in the field ( i.e. without optical counterparts ) are not different from those in globular clusters .    the allowed black hole mass range for x - ray sources in nearby galaxies span five orders of magnitude ( @xmath12 ) and it is important to obtain tighter constrains . here",
    ", we show that the absence of a detectable optical emission allows us to impose an upper limit on the black hole mass for these accreting systems based on some standard assumptions .",

    "this constant offset was applied for a given galaxy , to match the _",
    "sources to the optical sources in the _ sextractor _ catalog .",
    "when images are available in multiple filters , one of the optical images is considered as the reference image , and the necessary offset is applied to match it to the x - ray co - ordinates .",
    "the images in other optical filters are then aligned to the reference image using _ geomap _ and _ geotran _ tasks in iraf . while a more detailed report on the nature of sources with optical counterparts will be presented later , in this work , we concentrate on those sources for which no optical counterpart was detected .",
    "x - ray sources which did not have an optical counterpart ( at the 3@xmath1sigma level ) within @xmath46 of their shifted positions , are termed as optically `` dark '' sources .",
    "six examples of such sources are shown in figure [ optimg ] , where the @xmath46 and @xmath47 circles centered on the x - ray co - ordinates are overlaid on the observed optical image .",
    "note that for four of these images , there are no optical source within @xmath47 of the x - ray position . having identified such optically `` dark '' x - ray sources , we estimate the upper limit on their optical flux based on the 3@xmath1sigma threshold at that position .",
    "these optically dark sources are x - ray bright compared to their optical emission and hence are not foreground stars .",
    "this can be further quantified by estimating the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the unabsorbed flux in the @xmath50 band and @xmath51 is the flux in an optical band .",
    "this ratio ranges from @xmath52 to @xmath53 for agns including bl  lacs when @xmath49 is in the @xmath54 band and the v - band magnitude is used @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the estimated lower limit for the optically dark sources in the sample is significantly larger .",
    "this is illustrated in table ( [ bhmass ] ) where the ratio is given for ten sources .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that these sources are not background agns .",
    "thus , these sources are most likely to be bright x - ray binaries ( or at least accreting systems ) within the galaxy . an accretion disk around a compact object",
    "should also produce optical emission whose flux can be estimated as follows . in the standard accretion disk theory @xcite ,",
    "the effective temperature profile as a function of radius @xmath55 , of an accretion disk around a black hole with mass @xmath56 and accretion rate @xmath57 , is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the observed flux from the disk at a frequency @xmath60 is then given by the integrated sum of the black body emission over all radii , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the blackbody intensity , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are outer and inner radii of the disk , @xmath65 is the inclination angle of the disk and @xmath66 is the distance to the source . assuming that most of the contribution to @xmath67 arises from regions in the disk that are far away from the inner and outer radii , the expected observed flux can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the wavelength and @xmath70 is the radiative efficiency of the accreting system and cos@xmath65 is taken to be @xmath71 .    for optically dark ulx",
    ", the predicted accretion flux should be less than the measured upper limit @xmath72 .",
    "thus one can estimate an upper limit on the black hole mass as @xmath73 for each dark x - ray source in our sample , and for all available filters , we estimate this upper limit on the black hole mass .",
    "we use the integration ( eqn [ eqn.fv ] ) to evaluate the upper limit , rather than the approximation eqn .",
    "( [ m_u ] ) i.e. we take into account the effect of the inner boundary condition ( @xmath59 ) on the temperature profile .",
    "the difference in the upper limit obtained is marginal ( @xmath74% ) .",
    "we assume a standard radiative efficiency of @xmath75 and cos@xmath76 . to obtain a more conservative upper limit , the one - sigma lower value of the x - ray luminosity",
    "are used @xmath77 . in table",
    "[ bhmass ] , we list the ten best cases in ascending order of black hole mass limit @xmath78 . for the other sources , @xmath79 and hence is not a significant constraint .",
    "the best case is for the ulx in ngc 4486 , for which @xmath80 .",
    "x - ray irradiation of the outer disk may increase the local temperature there and the disk may emit a larger optical emission .",
    "we have estimated this effect using the formalism given in the appendix of @xcite and find that x - ray irradiation is not important for the constraint obtained here .",
    "optically dark x - ray sources can not be foreground stars or background agn , otherwise their optical emission would be significantly higher than what is detected . hence , these are a clean sample of sources within the host galaxies , which are probably accreting black hole systems .",
    "the optical emission from a standard accretion disk scales as mass of the black hole @xmath81 and hence the non - detection of optical emission imposes an upper limit on the black holes mass @xmath78 . for ten of the sources @xmath82 . for a source in ngc 4486 with an x - ray luminosity clearly exceeding @xmath83 ergs / s ( and therefore a bona - fide ulx by definition ) ,",
    "the estimated black hole mass is smaller than @xmath84 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude smaller than the constraint obtained from dynamical friction , which is @xmath85 .",
    "these sources with black hole mass , @xmath86 can not be accreting systems with massive black holes residing in star clusters , or in the nuclei of merged satellite galaxies . for typical low - luminosity dwarf galaxies ( @xmath87 ;",
    "* ) , such an optical counterpart would be easily detected , given that our 3@xmath1sigma limits on the @xmath45 images are much fainter .",
    "even a compact nucleus of a merged dwarf galaxy ( @xmath88 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would have been easily identified .",
    "if they are binary systems , their companion can not be a massive o star as such a star would have been detected in the optical image .",
    "assuming an o star , with @xmath89 , we find that the possibility of such a companion can be ruled out in all cases for which @xmath86 ( table [ bhmass ] ) .    in all of the above arguments , we have ignored the effect of dust obscuration in the host galaxies , because we are only considering elliptical galaxies in the present work .",
    "although some ellipticals are known to have dust lanes , and nuclear rings in their centers , the x - ray sources we are considering here are distributed at fairly large radial distance from the center to be significantly affected by dust .    even for the best cases of optically dark x - ray sources presented in table ( [ bhmass ] ) ,",
    "the range of black hole mass allowed is still large as the source could be a @xmath90 intermediate mass black hole , or a few solar mass object emitting at super - eddington luminosities .",
    "the brightest x - ray sources in the sample have a luminosity of a few times @xmath83 ergs / s .",
    "this is unfortunate , since a dark source with luminosity @xmath91 would have provided an order of magnitude better constraint on the black hole mass . since the black hole mass upper limit @xmath92 a bright x - ray source in a more nearby galaxy ( @xmath93 )",
    "would have also provided significantly better constraints . a systematic search for such sources in very nearby galaxies may indeed prove fruitful .",
    "another point to note is that bright x - ray sources in these galaxies are known to be variable in x - rays .",
    "our analysis in this work , implicitly assumes that the x - ray luminosity observed through a single _ chandra _ observation , represents an average luminosity which is used to derive an average accretion rate @xmath94 which in turn is used to estimate the upper limit on the black hole mass ( eqn [ m_u ] ) .",
    "this assumption is required because the expected optical emission arises from the outer part of the disk and the local accretion rate there may be different than the one in the inner region which produces the x - rays .",
    "any accretion rate fluctuation in the outer disk will be transfered along the disk on the viscous time - scale which could be significantly longer than a day .",
    "thus , in principle one needs to ascertain the average x - ray luminosity of a source , and using a single very bright , but rare , x - ray observation of the source will not represent the average accretion rate .",
