    "the coupling between an atom and the quantized electromagnetic field represents a paradigmatic setup in quantum optics that allows one to study the interaction of light and matter in a fully quantum way . in most related experiments",
    ", an atom is placed inside a cavity , from where stems the labelling `` cavity quantum electrodynamics '' @xcite .    in the last years",
    "the implementation of such systems in the solid state realm has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "depending on the experimental implementation , the atom is realized artificially with a superconducting circuit or a quantum dot , while a quantum lc - circuit as part of a transmission line or a photonic crystal , respectively , serves as cavity .",
    "this not only provides a widely enhanced tunability of parameters in an experiment , but also allows one to achieve the strong coupling limit between the artificial atom and the cavity , where the interaction exceeds the decay rates of the atom and the cavity by far .",
    "it has recently been shown that the coupling strength may even be enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional cavity qed experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , circuit qed systems may be used for many experimental validations of quantum mechanics , such as the quantum - non - demolition - like readout of a qubit state @xcite , the generation of fock states @xcite , the observation of berry phases @xcite , or multiphoton resonances @xcite .",
    "generation of entanglement between the qubit and the cavity via a landau zener sweep has been theoretically proposed as well @xcite . from a fundamental point of view",
    "these setups , realizing `` quantum optics on a chip '' , give the opportunity to rediscover and improve the vast goals of quantum optics and to test experimentally its concepts in the solid state .    however , the mentioned experiments involve `` only '' a single qubit and one cavity . with a view to quantum computing ,",
    "i.e.  in order to realize a quantum register , it is highly desirable to couple several of these qubit - cavity systems to obtain a circuit qed network .",
    "this would not only allow for performing quantum operations such as quantum gates , but also enable the creation and distribution of entanglement throughout the network .",
    "indeed , a setup to couple two cavities via an ancilla qubit has been recently proposed in @xcite , while in recent experiments @xcite , two qubits have been entangled via one cavity .    in this paper , referring to the setup of ref .",
    "@xcite we suggest the transfer of entanglement between two qubit - cavity systems via an ancilla qubit , which requires entangling different cavities . we restrict ourselves to the case where the qubit - cavity entanglement is created via a landau - zener sweep ; cf",
    ".  ref .",
    "@xcite .    due to the interaction with a dissipative environment , entanglement within an open quantum system",
    "is typically subject to decay via spontaneous emission .",
    "for the non - trivial class of states discussed here , this can even occur during finite time .",
    "this phenomena of `` sudden death of entanglement '' has been investigated theoretically for a conventional cavity qed setup @xcite and observed in an experiment as well @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ entanglement - lzsweep ]",
    "we shortly review the elementary description of a superconducting qubit coupled to an electromagnetic quantum circuit .",
    "further , we give a brief review on the creation of entanglement between qubit and cavity by a landau - zener sweep . in section [ dissipative ]",
    "we discuss the influence of a dissipative environment on the final entangled qubit - cavity state . in section [ sec : quantumnetworks ] we consider a network architecture consisting of two qubit - cavity systems dynamically coupled via an ancilla qubit , and discuss how this dynamical interaction yields an entangled two - cavity state",
    ". finally , in section [ suddendeath ] , we investigate the finite - time disentanglement of that state under environmental influence , depending on the details of state preparation .",
    "among many possible setups for circuit qed , one concrete realization is given by a cooper pair box ( cpb ) that couples capacitively to a lc circuit , which acts as a harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the cpb is formed of a superconducting island connected to a superconducting reservoir by a dc squid .",
    "the effective josephson energy @xmath0 can be tuned via an external flux @xmath1 penetrating the squid , where @xmath2 denotes the flux quantum .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is switchable within a sufficiently large time interval such that @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the capacitive energy of the cpb , @xmath5 is determined by the material - dependent charging energy @xmath6 , the number @xmath7 of cooper pairs on the island , and the reduced background charge @xmath8 which is proportional to a voltage bias @xmath9 . in the charging limit @xmath10 and near the charge degeneracy point @xmath11 , it is justified to describe the cpb by its two lowest charge states @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this allows the interpretation as a two - level system ( tls ) or qubit for which the hamiltonian pseudo - spin notation reads @xmath14 .",
    "it possesses the eigenstates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    making use of the standard rabi model the total qubit - oscillator hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath17 the second term refers to the coupling of the qubit to the fundamental mode of the transmission line , which is modeled as a harmonic oscillator with the usual bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 and energy eigenstates @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",

[",

    "it should be noted that the probability ( [ plz ] ) does not provide any direct information about the final oscillator state .",
    "however , due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ rabi ] ) , every creation or annihilation of a photon is accompanied by a qubit flip , which restricts the resulting dynamics to the states @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the `` no - go - up '' theorem states that @xmath34 for @xmath35 @xcite .",

    "this means a great simplification since it allows one to reduce the number of all relevant oscillator states to two .",

    "it is useful to introduce the density matrix for the qubit - cavity system @xmath45 that reads , in the basis @xmath46 , @xmath47 as a consequence , we can use the concurrence as a well - defined measure of entanglement for the two two - level systems .",

    "for the density matrix ( [ rhoclosed ] ) , the concurrence is given by @xmath55 thus , the amount of entanglement in the long - time limit is given by @xmath56 , which just depends on the ratio @xmath57 .",
