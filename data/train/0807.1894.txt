    "remarkable progress made in epitaxial crystal growth techniques has led to the fabrication of novel semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "these modern microstructuring techniques have made possible the realization of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) system in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "2deg is a condensed matter system where a number of novel phenomena have been observed over the years .",
    "one such phenomena was the observation of commensurability oscillations in physical properties when the 2deg in the presence of a magnetic field is subjected to electric modulation .",
    "the electric modulation introduces an additional length scale in the system and the occurrence of these oscillations , commonly known as weiss oscillations , is due to the commensurability of the electron cyclotron diameter at the fermi energy and the period of the electric modulation .",
    "these oscillations were found to be periodic in the inverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this type of electrical modulation of the 2d system can be carried out by depositing an array of parallel metallic strips on the surface or through two interfering laser beams @xcite .",
    "one of the important electronic properties of a system are the collective excitations ( plasmons ) .",
    "weiss oscillations in the magnetoplasmon spectrum of 2deg has been the subject of continued interest @xcite .",
    "recently , the fabrication of crytallites of graphene monolayer has generated a lot of interest .",
    "the study of this new material is not only of academic interest but there are serious efforts underway to investigate whether it can serve as the basic material for a carbon - based electronics that might replace silicon - based electronics .",
    "graphene has a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms .",
    "the quasiparticles in graphene have a band structure in which electron and hole bands touch at two points in the brillouin zone . at",
    "these dirac points the quasiparticles obey the massless dirac equation .",
    "in other words , they behave as massless dirac fermions leading to a linear dispersion relation @xmath1 ( with the characteristic velocity @xmath2 .",
    "this difference in the nature of the quasiparticles in graphene from conventional 2deg has given rise to a host of new and unusual phenomena such as anomalous quantum hall effects and a @xmath0 berry s phase@xcite@xcite .",
    "these transport experiments have shown results in agreement with the presence of dirac fermions .",
    "the 2d dirac - like spectrum was confirmed recently by cyclotron resonance measurements and also by angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements in monolayer graphene@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work on graphene multilayers has also shown the existence of dirac electrons with a linear energy spectrum in monolayer graphene@xcite .",
    "plasmons in graphene were studied as early as in the eighties@xcite and more recently @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate magnetoplasmons in graphene monolayer when it is subjected to electric modulation at finite temperature .",
    "the zero temperature study was carried out by us in an earlier work @xcite where we showed that the intra - landau band magnetoplasmons exhibit weiss oscillations and are present in the system due to the broadening of the landau levels as a result of modulation . presently , we extend our earlier work by taking into account the effects of temperature on the magnetoplasmons in graphene . while working on the finite temperature dispersion relation for magnetoplasmons in graphene we realized that finite temperature calculation for 2deg is not available in the literature",
    "so in this work we also determine the finite temperature dispersion relation for magnetoplasmons in electrically modulated 2deg .",
    "we find that the magnetoplasmons are more robust against temperature than those occurring in a conventional 2deg realized in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "characteristic temperatures are determined for the damping of the magnetic oscillations ( sdh and weiss ) in both the graphene and 2deg systems .",
    "the experimental study of these should be as revealing as the enhanced magnetoconductivity prediction@xcite and even more interesting : it bears directly on the many - body properties of the two - dimensional systems , as well as the frequency dependent transport and optical response .",
    "we consider two - dimensional dirac electrons in graphene moving in the @xmath3-plane . the magnetic field ( @xmath4 )",
    "is applied along the @xmath5-direction perpendicular to the graphene plane .",
    "this system is subjected to weak electric modulation along the @xmath6-direction .",
    "we employ the landau gauge and write the vector potential as @xmath7 .",
    "the two - dimensional dirac like hamiltonian for single electron in the landau gauge is @xcite@xmath8 here  @xmath9 are the pauli matrices and @xmath10 characterizes the electron velocity .",
    "the complete hamiltonian of our system is represented as@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unmodulated hamiltonian and @xmath13 is the one - dimensional periodic modulation potential along the @xmath6-direction modelled as@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the period of modulation and @xmath16 is the constant modulation amplitude .",

    "related physics can be made more transparent by considering the asymptotic expression of intra - landau band magnetoplasmon spectrum , where analytic results in terms of elementary functions can be obtained .    to obtain the asymptotic expression for the intra - landau band plasmon spectrum we employ the following asymptotic expression for",

    "we also take @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 weiss oscillations superimposed on the sdh oscillations can be clearly seen in both the curves . in eq.(15 ) , the terms containing the characteristic temperature for weiss oscillations @xmath96 are mainly responsible for weiss oscillations whereas terms containing @xmath97 are responsible for the sdh oscillations .",
    "the intra - landau - band plasmons have frequencies comparable to the bandwidth and they occur as a result of broadening of the landau levels due to the modulation in our system . these type of intra - landau - band plasmons accompanied by regular oscillatory behavior ( in @xmath98 of the sdh type was first predicted in @xcite for tunneling planar superlattice where the overlap of electron wavefunction in adjacent quantum wells provides the mechanism for broadening of landau levels .",
    "the sdh oscillations occur as a result of emptying out of electrons from successive landau levels when they pass through the fermi level as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations is a monotonic function of the magnetic field when the landau bandwidth is independent of the band index @xmath99 in the density modulated case , the landau bandwidths oscillate as a function of the band index @xmath100 with the result that in the plasmon spectrum of the intra - landau band type , there is a new kind of oscillation called weiss oscillation which is also periodic in @xmath101 but with a different period and amplitude from the sdh type oscillation .",

    "the oscillations in the conventional 2deg have been damped out strongly at @xmath119 but are well resolved , significant and have larger amplitude in graphene at the same temperature .",
    "this confirms that the graphene oscillations are more robust and enhanced against temperature than those in the conventional 2deg .",
    "the magnetic oscillations , sdh and weiss , have a higher amplitude in graphene compared to 2deg .",
    "this can be attributed to the larger characteristic velocity ( @xmath121 of electrons in graphene compared to the fermi velocity of standard electrons and smaller background dielectric constant @xmath30 in graphene in contrast to conventional 2deg .",
    "the temperature at which we expect the weiss oscillations to dampen is determined by comparing the characteristic temperatures for weiss oscillations in the two systems : @xmath122 , the ratio of the characteristic temperatures is equal to the corresponding velocities at the fermi surface@xcite . for the parameters used in this work @xmath123 implying that weiss oscillations are damped at a higher temperature in graphene compared to the 2deg .",
    "similarly , damping of sdh oscillations can also be compared in the two systems through their corresponding characteristic temperatures : @xmath124 for @xmath125 m@xmath89 whereas it is @xmath126 @xmath127 for @xmath88 m@xmath128 therefore , sdh oscillations are damped at a higher temperature in graphene compared to 2deg .",
    "furthermore , our results also show that these oscillations in the magnetoplasmon spectrum differ in phase by @xmath0 in the two systems which is due to quasiparticles in graphene acquiring a berry s phase of @xmath0 as they move in the magnetic field@xcite .",
    "we have determined the finite temperature intra - landau band magnetoplasmon frequency for electrically modulated graphene as well as the 2deg in the presence of a magnetic field employing the scf approach .",
    "we find that the magnetic oscillations ( sdh and weiss ) in the magnetoplasmon spectrum in graphene monolayer have a higher amplitude compared to the conventional 2deg realized in semiconductor heterostructures .",
