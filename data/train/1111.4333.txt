    "the khler structure of moduli space induces the localization property in the integration of the khler form which gives the volumes .",

    "this localization simplifies the evaluation of the volume of the moduli space drastically .",
    "the localization technique is based on a topological field theory , which can be understood as a twisted version of the supersymmetric theories@xcite .",

    "we can also evaluate the volume of the moduli space of the non - abelian vortices , although it has been difficult to construct the metric of moduli space of the non - abelian vortex apart from well - separated local vortices ( @xmath6 ) @xcite . by imposing the bps equations as constraints in the field configuration space",
    ", we can regard the moduli space of bps solitons as the quotient space of the fields , similarly to the khler quotient space .",
    "the integrals to give the volume of the moduli space reduces to simple residue integrals in the localization technique .",

    "the asymptotic power of @xmath17 for semi - local vortices ( @xmath141 ) is given by @xmath142 combining the @xmath143 results ( [ eq : asymp_power_semi2 ] ) and ( [ eq : asymp_power_semi3 ] ) of the asymptotic power of @xmath17 for semi - local vortices ( @xmath144 ) , we conjecture the asymptotic power for generic semi - local vortices @xmath144 as @xmath145 similarly to the @xmath133 case , we observe the reduction of the asymptotic power of @xmath17 for local vortices ( @xmath6 ) compared to the semi - local vortices @xmath146 combining the results ( [ eq : asymp_power_local2 ] ) and ( [ eq : asymp_power_local3 ] ) of @xmath143 cases , we conjecture the asymptotic power of @xmath17 of the volume of @xmath33 local vortices for the general values of @xmath147 as @xmath148    in the cse of the local vortex @xmath149 , @xmath150    we have also computed the case of torus topology for the base manifold .",

    "in order to understand the reduction of the asymptotic power of @xmath17 of local vortices ( @xmath6 ) compared to semi - local vortices ( @xmath144 ) , we study the effective lagrangian by using the moduli matrix formalism@xcite .    for arbitrary vortex number , we first work out the effective lagrangian of abelian semi - local vortices ( @xmath151 ) on the sphere , using the strong coupling @xmath152 . in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "the solution @xmath153 of the master equation is solved algebraically @xmath154 . therefore the boundary condition for the vortex number @xmath33 is satisfied by requiring that at least one of components of moduli matrix to be a polynomial of order @xmath33 , and all other components to be at most of order @xmath33 @xmath155 where at least one of the coefficients of the @xmath33-th power is non - vanishing : @xmath156 .",
    "compared to the usual noncompact plane , we emphasize two new features of the vortex moduli on the compact riemann surfaces which are realized in the moduli matrix ( [ eq : u1modulimatrix_kvortex ] ) .",
    "firstly we allow the leading power of @xmath157 to be in any components .",
    "if we use global @xmath158 rotations combined with the @xmath159-transformations , it is possible to place the leading power to be in a particular component , say in the first component .",
    "this form is the usual choice for the moduli matrix on noncompact flat plane @xcite .",
    "these new @xmath160 moduli may be regarded as an orientation of the vacuum at infinity and are nonnormalizable on noncompact plane : @xmath161 after dividing out by @xmath159-transformations .",
    "these @xmath160 extra complex moduli parameters are present even in the case of vacuum ( @xmath162 ) on compact riemann surfaces .",
    "secondly the additional @xmath160 `` size '' moduli are retained on compact riemann surfaces , since they become normalizable and are dynamical variables in the effective lagrangian .",
    "more specifically , the standard moduli matrix on noncompact plane contains up to only @xmath163-th power of @xmath157 except in the first component .",
    "the @xmath160 coefficients of these @xmath163-th power represent `` size '' of vortices , are nonnormalizable , and have to be fixed by the boundary condition on noncompact plane .",
    "both of the `` vacuum '' and the `` size '' moduli become normalizable and provide additional @xmath164 complex moduli on compact riemann surfaces .",
    "let us emphasize that these new moduli should be fixed by boundary conditions and will not be a genuine moduli parameter of the solution once we take the limit of noncompact base manifold , such as a plane .",
    "the khler potential of the effective lagrangian has been obtained@xcite .",
    "we generalize the formula to the case of curved manifold such as riemann surfaces , and insert the moduli matrix ( [ eq : u1modulimatrix_kvortex ] ) to obtain the khler potential on the sphere @xmath165 we find that the integral is convergent and is proportional to @xmath17 , indicating that all the moduli parameters take values of order @xmath17 .",
    "so we find that each complex moduli gives a power of @xmath166 .",
    "since there are @xmath167 complex moduli , we obtain the volume of the moduli space asymptotically @xmath168 to be proportional to the @xmath167 power of @xmath17 @xmath169 where the coefficient of @xmath170 is given by an integral representation for @xmath171 .",
    "this asymptotic power agrees with the result ( [ eq : u1nfvolume ] ) of the topological field theory .",
    "we have also worked out the effective lagrangian on sphere for non - abelian semi - local vortices ( @xmath172 ) @xcite by using the moduli matrix approach@xcite .",
    "similarly to the abelian semi - local vortices , we have found that the each complex moduli contributes to an asymptotic power of @xmath17 at the strong coupling limit , in agreement with the result ( [ eq : semilocalasymptotic ] ) of the topological field theory .    in the case of non - abelian local vortices with @xmath173 ,",
    "we have worked out previously the metric of a single vortex on a plane in the moduli matrix formalism@xcite .",
    "we found that only the position moduli can be of order @xmath174 , whereas other orientational moduli consists of @xmath175 with the radius of order @xmath176 .",
    "moduli space of multi - vortices @xmath177 are symmetric product of @xmath33 moduli spaces of each single vortex except for separations of order smaller than the vortex size @xmath176 .",
    "these facts imply that the orientational moduli can only give a finite volume unrelated to @xmath17 , whereas the vortex position can be of order @xmath174 .",
    "therefore the volume of the moduli space for @xmath33 local non - abelian vortices is proportional to @xmath178 , which agrees with our result ( [ eq : asymptoticpowerun ] ) of the topological field theory .",
    "the volume of moduli space of vortices are computed for @xmath3 gauge theory with @xmath4 higgs fields in the fundamental representation , using the localization technique of topological field theory .",
    "volume of moduli space of ano vortices ( @xmath179 ) for any vortex number @xmath33 and for any genus @xmath0 of riemann surfaces is obtained and agrees with the previous direct calculation using the effective lagrangian .",
    "volume of moduli space is obtained both for abelian semi - local vortices ( @xmath151 ) and non - abelian vortices ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "we find that the asymptotic power of area @xmath17 for @xmath181 is @xmath182 for semi - local vortices ( @xmath144 ) , and that the power reduces to @xmath178 for local vortices ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "reduction of asymptotic power is understood by noticing that internal modes other than position do not extend over the whole area @xmath17 for local vortices .",
    "localization technique should be powerful to obtain the volume of moduli space of other solitons@xcite .",

    "<S> volume of moduli space of bps vortices on a compact genus @xmath0 riemann surface @xmath1 is evaluated by means of topological field theory and localization technique . </S>",
    "<S> vortex in abelian gauge theory with a single charged scalar field ( ano vortex ) is studied first and is found that the volume of the moduli space agrees with the previous results obtained more directly by integrating over the moduli space metric . </S>",
    "<S> next we extend the evaluation to non - abelian gauge groups and multi - flavors of scalar fields in the fundamental representation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the result of localization can be consistently understood in terms of moduli matrix formalism wherever possible . </S>",
    "<S> more details are found in our paper@xcite . </S>"
