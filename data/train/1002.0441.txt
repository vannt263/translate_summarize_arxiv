    "optical - conductivity measurements could provide a way to determine the respective strength of both socs.@xcite    in this article we address the problem of ballistic spin - dependent scattering in the presence of inhomogeneous spin - orbit couplings .",
    "our main motivation stems from a recent experiment that reported a large enhancement of rashba soc splitting in single - layer graphene grown on ni(111 ) intercalated with a au monolayer.@xcite further experimental results show that the intercalation of au atoms between graphene and the ni substrate is essential in order to observe sizable rashba effect.@xcite the preparation technique of ref",
