    "perovskite mn oxides of r@xmath12a@xmath13mno@xmath14 ( ramo ;",
    "r : rare earth ; a : divalent cation ) @xcite have attracted much attention due to the colossal - magnetoresistance ( cmr ) behavior .",
    "pure lamno@xmath14 is an antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "when lamno@xmath14 is doped with divalent cations , it undergoes a phase transition to a ferromagnetic metal , in which mn ions can exist in the formally trivalent and tetravalent states .",
    "zener has explained @xcite the simultaneous metallic and ferromagnetic transition in ramo in terms of the double - exchange ( de ) interaction between spin - aligned mn@xmath9 ( @xmath15 ) and mn@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) ions through oxygen ions .    in the de model",
    ", mn ions should exist in mixed - valent states to maintain the correlation between magnetism and conductivity .",
    "the question has been raised whether the de mechanism is still operative when a tetravalent ion is doped instead of a divalent ion @xcite .",
    "this will result in a system with mn ions being in the mn@xmath8 ( @xmath18)/mn@xmath9 ( @xmath19 ) mixed - valent states .",
    "interestingly , the metal - insulator ( m - i ) and ferromagnetic transitions and the concomitant cmr phenomenon have been observed in the ce - doped manganites of r@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath14 ( r = la , pr , nd ) @xcite .",
    "if ce ions in r@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath14 exist in the tetravalent states , mn@xmath8 ions could be formed and electron - like charge carriers would be responsible for the metallic conductivity and ferromagnetism . therefore it is essential to know the electronic structures of r@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath14 in order to understand the underlying physics for the metallic ferromagnetism properly .    in our previous photoemission spectroscopy ( pes )",
    "study on polycrystalline la@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lcemo ) bulk samples @xcite , we have found that ce ions in lcemo are mainly in the tetravalent ( @xmath20 ) states , which allows the existence of the divalent mn@xmath8 ions in lcemo . however , one of the main difficulties in this system is that the la@xmath12ce@xmath13mno@xmath14 system forms in the single phase only in epitaxial thin films @xcite .",
    "recently , the ce@xmath16 valence state and the mn@xmath8-mn@xmath9 mixed - valent states were observed in a thin film of lcemo @xcite via x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) .",
    "nevertheless , the detailed spectroscopic information on the electronic states near the fermi energy @xmath21 is lacking for lcemo , which is important in understanding the nature of the charge carriers . in this paper , we report the pes and xas study of lcemo thin films .",
    "this work includes the resonant photoemission spectroscopy ( rpes ) measurement near the ce @xmath22 absorption edge , and the xas measurements near the ce and la @xmath3 , mn @xmath7 , and o @xmath23 absorption edges .",
    "pes and xas data have been compared to the band - structure calculations performed in the lsda@xmath11 method ( lsda : local spin - density approximation ) where @xmath10 denotes the on - site coulomb correlation interaction for both mn @xmath3 and ce @xmath5 electrons .",
    "the epitaxial films of la@xmath0ce@xmath1mno@xmath14 were deposited on laalo@xmath14 ( lao ) substrates using a krf excimer laser , as described in ref .",
    "pes and xas measurements were performed at the 2b1 beamline of the pohang accelerator laboratory ( pal ) .",
    "the chamber pressure was about @xmath24 10@xmath25 torr during measurements .",
    "all spectra were obtained at room temperature . the fermi level of the system was determined from the valence - band spectrum of a au foil in electrical contact with samples .",
    "the overall instrumental resolution was about @xmath26 mev at a photon energy @xmath27 ev and @xmath28 mev at @xmath29 ev . to obtain clean surfaces ,",
    "the samples were annealed repeatedly at @xmath30 700 @xmath31c in the o@xmath4 pressure of about @xmath32 torr .",
    "the cleanliness of sample surfaces was monitored by the absence of the bump around 9 ev binding energy ( be ) and the symmetrical line shape of the o @xmath23 core level .",
    "the electronic structures of lcemo have been calculated by employing the self - consistent lmto ( linearized muffin - tin - orbital ) band method . to simulate the ce - doped lamno@xmath14 system",
    ", we considered a supercell of la@xmath4cemn@xmath14o@xmath33 with a tetragonal structure ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the partial densities of states ( pdoss ) for lcemo were obtained from the lsda+@xmath10 band method which incorporates the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction @xcite .",
    "we first present the ce and la @xmath3 core level pes and xas spectra of lcemo .",
    "xas and core - level spectroscopy are powerful methods of determining the valence states of ions in solids . in the final state of core - level pes and xas spectra , a core hole is left behind , and it couples with valence electrons . in the systems with incompletely filled @xmath5 or @xmath3 electrons ,",
    "the coupling between the core hole and @xmath5 or @xmath3 electrons is strong enough to cause the characteristic spectral splitting in xas and xps spectra .",
    "therefore , by analyzing xps and xas , an important information on the @xmath5 and @xmath3 valence electrons can be obtained .",
    "figure  [ 3d ] compares the ce @xmath3 core - level pes spectrum of lcemo to that of ceo@xmath4 with formally tetravalent ce ions ( ce@xmath16 ) ( upper panel ) , and the la @xmath3 core - level pes spectrum of lcemo to that of la@xmath4o@xmath14 with formally trivalent la ions ( la@xmath9 ) ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the @xmath3 core - level spectra of ceo@xmath36 and la@xmath4o@xmath14 were reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of ceo@xmath4 was then shifted so that the @xmath37 main peak is aligned to that of lcemo .",
    "these spectra exhibit the same magnitudes of the spin - orbit splittings between the @xmath38 and @xmath37 levels , 16.8 ev for the la @xmath3 spectra and 18.1 ev for the ce @xmath3 spectra , respectively .",
    "it is clearly observed that the ce and la @xmath3 spectra of lcemo are very similar to those of ceo@xmath36 and la@xmath4o@xmath14 , respectively , indicating that ce ions in lcemo are nearly tetravalent ( ce@xmath16 ) while la ions are trivalent ( la@xmath9 ) .",
    "the solid lines along the measured @xmath3 spectra for ceo@xmath4 and la@xmath4o@xmath14 denote the curve - fitting results , by employing the doniach - sunjic line - shape function @xcite .",
    "the curve - fitting analysis reveals that the ce @xmath3 pes spectrum of ceo@xmath4 consists of six peaks , and similarly for lcemo .",
    "these six peaks arise from the three - peak structures for each spin - orbit split component of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . among the three - peak structures , the highest",
    "be components ( c , c@xmath39 ) correspond to the roughly @xmath40 final - state configuration @xcite .",
    "so this figure indicates that ceo@xmath4 and lcemo have a very large amount of @xmath41 initial - state configuration .",
    "according to the impurity anderson hamiltonian ( iah ) analysis @xcite , the lowest be peaks ( a , a@xmath39 ) and the middle be peaks ( b , b@xmath39 ) correspond to the bonding and anti - bonding states of the strongly mixed @xmath42 and @xmath43 final - state configurations ( @xmath44 : a ligand hole ) . since the charge transfer energy @xmath45 between the @xmath46 and @xmath47 configurations is small in ceo@xmath4 , the ground state is strongly mixed between @xmath46 and @xmath47 configurations .",
    "hence the valence electronic states in ceo@xmath4 contain non - negligible contributions from the extended states of @xmath48 symmetry , even though the localized @xmath5 states remain nearly unoccupied .",
    "this results in the average @xmath5 electron number @xmath49 of about @xmath50 in ceo@xmath4 .",
    "the la @xmath3 spectra show the double - peak structures of nearly equal intensity for both the @xmath37 and @xmath38 levels . based on the iah analysis @xcite",
    ", it is well known that the la @xmath5 level in the ground state of la@xmath4o@xmath14 is nearly empty due to the very weak hybridization between la @xmath5 and o @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "on the other hand , in the @xmath3 core - hole final state , the attractive coulomb interaction @xmath51 between the @xmath3 core hole and the @xmath5 electrons ( @xmath52 ) pulls down the @xmath5 level , so that the charge transfer energy @xmath45 between @xmath40 and @xmath53 becomes almost vanishing , resulting in a strong hybridization between @xmath40 and @xmath53 final - state configurations .",
    "therefore the @xmath40 and @xmath53 configurations are strongly mixed in the @xmath3 core - hole final state of la@xmath4o@xmath14 .",
    "the two peaks of the la @xmath3 core level pes spectrum in la@xmath4o@xmath14 correspond to the bonding and antibonding states of the @xmath40 and @xmath53 configurations . due to the strong final - state mixing in la@xmath4o@xmath14 ,",
    "the intensities @xcite of the two peaks become comparable .",
    "this interpretation can be similarly applied to the la @xmath3 pes spectrum of lcemo .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ 3d ] provides evidence that la @xmath5 states are almost unoccupied in the ground state ( @xmath46 ) , but are strongly hybridized with the o @xmath7 states in the @xmath3 core - hole final state .",
    "figure  [ 3dxas ] shows the ce @xmath3 xas spectra of lcemo and ceo@xmath4 , and the la @xmath3 xas spectra of lcemo and la@xmath4o@xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath3 xas spectra of both ceo@xmath4 and la@xmath4o@xmath14 were reproduced from ref .",
    "the ce @xmath3 xas spectrum of lcemo is very similar to that of ceo@xmath36 , consistent with the finding for ce @xmath3 pes spectrum , which confirms the tetravalent valency of ce ions in lcemo .",
    "the ce @xmath3 xas spectra of both lcemo and ceo@xmath4 reveal a main peak ( m ) and a weak satellite ( s ) on the high - energy side of the main peak .",
    "the main ce @xmath3 xas peaks show no multiplet structures .",
    "the main ( m ) and satellite ( s ) peaks correspond to the bonding and anti - bonding final states of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 mixed configurations .",
    "since the ground state @xmath56 of ceo@xmath4 will be @xmath57 , the @xmath3 xas final states will have both the @xmath54 and @xmath58 configurations . in both lcemo and ceo@xmath4 ,",
    "the energy difference between m and s in the ce @xmath3 xas spectrum ( @xmath59 ev ) is approximately the same as that between a(a@xmath39 ) and b(b@xmath39 ) in the ce @xmath3 core - level pes spectrum ( @xmath60 ev ) .",
    "note that , except for the weak satellite features , the ce @xmath3 xas spectrum of ceo@xmath4 is very similar to the la @xmath3 xas spectrum of la@xmath4o@xmath14 , suggesting that the multiplet structures of the @xmath3 xas of ceo@xmath36 resemble those of la@xmath4o@xmath14 with la@xmath9 which has the @xmath46 configuration in the ground state .",
    "figure  [ rpes ] presents the normalized valence - band spectra for lcemo obtained at the ce @xmath22 absorption region . in each set of the two superposed spectra , solid lines and open circles",
    "correspond to the spectrum for the lower @xmath61 and that for the next higher @xmath61 .",
    "the values of @xmath61 s are labelled at the left side of the spectra in the increasing order from bottom toward top of the figure .",
    "if there are localized ce @xmath5 electrons , the @xmath5 photoemission intensity is enhanced at @xmath62 ev due to the resonance effect through the interference between two processes .",
    "the first is the direct photoemission process , such as @xmath63 where @xmath64@xmath65 denotes the emitted electron .",
    "the second is the photoabsorption of a @xmath66 electron to an unoccupied @xmath5 state , followed by a two - electron super coster - kronig decay , such as @xmath67 the interference between these two processes leads to the fano resonance .",
    "such a rpes process will not be invoked for a tetravalent ce@xmath16 ion ( @xmath46 ) because there is no direct process available .",
    "therefore the very weak enhancement around @xmath68 ev indicates that the localized ce @xmath5 states are nearly unoccupied in lcemo and that the ce valence is far from @xmath69 .",
    "this finding is consistent with that for the ce @xmath3 core - level pes and xas spectra ( fig .",
    "[ 3d ] and fig .",
    "[ 3dxas ] ) .    .    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ rpes ] shows @xmath61 dependence of the emissions at several initial - state energies .",
    "these are the plots of the photoemission intensities at several bes versus @xmath61 around the ce @xmath66 absorption thresholds . hence these curves measure the rpes cross - section line - shapes , and correspond to the constant - initial - state ( cis ) spectra .",
    "the vertical scale of this figure is arbitrary but it is the same for all the spectra with different be states .",
    "the o @xmath7 states , with be between @xmath70 ev and @xmath71 ev , show the strong peaks around @xmath72 ev .",
    "this peak reflects the resonance enhancement of the extended states of @xmath48 symmetry near the ce @xmath22 absorption due to the hybridization mixing of the o @xmath7 states with the ce @xmath5 states .",
    "this interpretation agrees with that for ceo@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "note that the low be states , those at @xmath73 ev below @xmath21 , show another weak peak around @xmath74 ev , which is ascribed to the resonance of the localized ce @xmath5 electrons due to the ce @xmath75 absorption .",
    "the very weak resonance of the low be states indicates that the localized @xmath5 states are almost unoccupied in lcemo . on the other hand , the strong resonance of the o @xmath7 electrons suggests that the valence - band states contain the extended states of @xmath48 symmetry , which are responsible for the non - negligible @xmath5 population of @xmath49 in its ground state ( @xmath76 for ceo@xmath4 ) .",
    "it is difficult to tell whether the resonance peak at @xmath77 ev for bes",
    "@xmath78 ev has a fano line - shape .",
    "this is because the enhancement is very weak and it overlaps with the strong la @xmath79 resonance due to the la 4d @xmath80 4f rpes , which has a broad maximum around @xmath81 ev @xcite .    in order to examine the resonating",
    "features more clearly , we have compared the valence - band spectra around the two resonating @xmath61 values of @xmath68 ev and @xmath82 ev .",
    "the left panel of fig .  [ diff ] compares the normalized valence - band spectra of lcemo obtained for @xmath83 ev and @xmath84 ev , and the difference between these two spectra is shown at the bottom .",
    "similarly , the right panel compares those for @xmath85 ev and @xmath86 ev , and the difference between these two spectra .",
    "the left panel shows that the ce @xmath5 contribution is the largest at @xmath87 ev below e@xmath88 with no ce @xmath5 emission at @xmath21 , consistent with the insulating state above t@xmath89 . as mentioned in fig .",
    "[ rpes ] , the magnitude of the ce @xmath5 resonance at @xmath62 ev is very weak , indicating that the localized ce @xmath5 sates are nearly unoccupied in lcemo and that the ce valence is far from @xmath69 .",
    "the right panel shows that the o @xmath7 states resonate at @xmath90ev and are spread between @xmath91 ev be with no states between @xmath21 and 2 ev be .",
    "figure  [ 2pxas ] compares the mn @xmath7 xas spectra of lcemo and lamno@xmath14 which was reproduced from ref .",
    "lamno@xmath14 was chosen as the reference material which has the formally trivalent ( @xmath69 ) mn ions and the same crystal symmetry .",
    "the difference curve between the mn @xmath7 xas spectrum of lcemo and that of lamno@xmath14 is shown at the bottom . the transition metal ( t ) @xmath7 xas spectrum results from the dipole transitions from the @xmath7 core level to the empty @xmath3 states .",
    "the peak positions and the line shape of the t @xmath7 xas spectrum depend on the local electronic structure of the t ion , which provides the information about the valence state and the ground state symmetry of the t ion @xcite .",
    "the mn @xmath92 and @xmath93 spectral parts are clearly separated by the large @xmath7 core - hole spin - orbit interaction .    similarly as in other manganites @xcite , the mn @xmath7 xas spectra of both lcemo and lamno@xmath14 exhibit two broad multiplets separated by the spin - orbit splitting of the mn @xmath7 core hole before subtraction . the main contributions to the broadening come from a large spread of the multiplets @xcite and a covalent character of the ground state .",
    "in contrast , the difference curve reveals the sharp structure around 640 ev , which resembles that in mno @xcite , indicating the existence of a mn@xmath8 component in lcemo . to check this argument ,",
    "we have compared the difference curve to the calculated mn @xmath7 xas spectrum ( gray lines ) for the mn@xmath8 ion under the octahedron symmetry ( @xmath94 ) symmetry with @xmath95 ev .",
    "this result has been reproduced from ref .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that the main features of the difference curve can be described mainly with the mn@xmath8 component under the @xmath94 symmetry .",
    "thus fig .",
    "[ 2pxas ] confirms the mn@xmath8-mn@xmath9 mixed - valent state of mn ions in lcemo , in agreement with the previous finding @xcite .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ mn3d ] shows the extraction procedure of the mn 3d partial spectral weight ( psw ) of lcemo . as a first approximation ,",
    "the mn @xmath3 psw of lcemo is determined by subtracting the valence - band spectrum at h@xmath96 ev , where the o @xmath7 emission is dominant , from that at the off - resonance ( h@xmath97 ev ) in ce @xmath22 rpes , where the mn @xmath3 and o @xmath7 emissions are comparable each other @xcite .",
    "the former spectrum has been scaled by a factor of @xmath98 to account for the h@xmath99-dependence of the o @xmath7 photoionization cross - section @xcite .",
    "the extracted mn @xmath3 states show two broad structures , around @xmath100 ev and and @xmath101 ev .",
    "the spectral intensity at @xmath102 ev below @xmath21 is weak .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ mn3d ] compares the mn @xmath3 psws of lcemo to those of nd@xmath103ca@xmath103mn@xmath104cr@xmath105o@xmath14 ( ncmo ; ref .",
    "@xcite ) and pr@xmath106sr@xmath107mno@xmath14 ( psmo ; ref .",
    "@xcite , both of which are metallic in the ground state .",
    "the former mn @xmath3 psw for ncmo was obtained from the mn @xmath108 rpes .",
    "the extraction procedure for the latter psw for psmo is described in ref .",
    "it was extracted by employing the same procedure as for lcemo , where @xmath109 ev was used as the off - resonance in pr @xmath110 rpes and the @xmath111 ev spectrum was considered as roughly representing the o @xmath7 spectrum . indeed ,",
    "the mn @xmath3 psw for psmo is very similar to that for ncmo , obtained from the mn @xmath112 rpes , except for the slightly lower intensity near @xmath21 .",
    "this finding supports the validity of the extraction scheme for the mn @xmath3 psw employed in this work .    in order to understand the microscopic origin of the valence - band electronic structures of lcemo ,",
    "we have compared the experimentally determined mn @xmath3 psw and o @xmath23 xas spectrum to the calculated mn @xmath3 pdos , which was obtained from the supercell lsda@xmath11 calculation .",
    "the o @xmath23 xas spectrum reflects the transition from the o @xmath23 core level to the unoccupied o @xmath7 states hybridized to the other electronic states .",
    "therefore the o @xmath23 xas provides a reasonable approximation for representing the unoccupied conduction - band electronic structure .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "the parameters used in this calculation are the coulomb correlation @xmath113 ev and the exchange correlation @xmath114 ev for mn @xmath3 electrons , and @xmath115 ev and @xmath116 ev for ce @xmath5 electrons .",
    "it is found that the lsda@xmath11 results are not very sensitive to the @xmath10-value , within @xmath117 ev . as shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ comp ] , the lsda@xmath11 calculation predicts a half - metallic ground state for lcemo , which is consistent with the calculated electronic structure obtained in the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) @xcite . in this comparison ,",
    "the o @xmath23 xas spectrum was shifted by @xmath118 ev with reference to the to the lsda@xmath11 calculation @xcite .",
    "this comparison shows that the measured pes / xas data for lcemo agrees reasonably well with the calculated mn @xmath3 pdos , particularly in the peak positions .",
    "the broad peak around @xmath119 ev originates from the t@xmath120 and e@xmath121@xmath122 majority - spin states , and the high be features ( @xmath123 ev ) have the strongly mixed electron character of the mn @xmath3-o @xmath7 electrons .",
    "the ground state of lcemo becomes half - metallic in the lsda@xmath11 calculation , reflecting that the de mechanism is still operative in lcemo@xcite .",
    "indeed this prediction is consistent with the recent observation @xcite of a tunneling magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic tunnel junction built from lcemo / la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , which suggests a high degree of spin polarization in lcemo .",
    "the lsda@xmath11 calculation , however , indicates that lcemo would be a majority - spin carrier half - metal , contrary to a minority - spin carrier half - metal suggested by ref .",
    "this point remains to be clarified experimentally by employing direct spin - resolved experimental probes .",
    "finally , the measured spectral weight at @xmath21 ( i(@xmath21 ) ) with respect to the mn @xmath124 peak is lower than the calculated pdos at @xmath21 ( n(@xmath21 ) ) .",
    "this difference near @xmath21 can be ascribed partly due to the measurement temperature being above the m - i transition and also due to some kind of the carrier localization mechanism .",
    "the most plausible localization mechanism would be the small polaron formation induced by the strong @xmath125 electron - phonon interaction , originating from the jahn - teller active mn@xmath9 ion in lcemo @xcite .",
