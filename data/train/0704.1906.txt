    "the proper treatment of electron correlation effects in molecules and solids stands at the heart of modern electronic structure theory @xcite . in the study of molecular systems at least",
    ", wavefunction based quantum chemistry is known to provide a rigorous theoretical framework for addressing the electron correlation problem .",
    "the standard quantum chemical methods @xcite make possible the construction of approximate wavefunctions at levels of increasing sophistication and accuracy and offer thus a systematic route to converged results . advanced wavefunction based calculations can be routinely performed nowadays for small and medium size molecules .",
    "however , algorithms able to treat electron correlation effects in periodic systems are still at their infancy .",
    "the simplest correlation method is based on the mller - plesset equations and second - order mller - plesset ( mp2 ) perturbational schemes for solids were actually implemented by several groups @xcite . as an extension of mp2 , _ ab initio",
    "_ many - body green s function techniques were developed too @xcite .",
    "in addition , investigations based on coupled - cluster ( cc ) theory were initiated @xcite .",
    "the main point when applying quantum chemical methods to correlation calculations is to make use of the local character of the correlation hole which is surrounding an electron .",
    "the latter optimizes the coulomb repulsion between electrons and its accurate description is the essence of the correlation treatment . starting point is a hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation on top of which the correlation calculations are implemented . for insulators and semiconductors ,",
    "the development of efficient computational tools is facilitated by the use of optimally localized wannier functions .",
    "several orbital localization procedures were proposed in the context of periodic hf calculations .",
    "they normally rest on the _ a posteriori _ transformation of the crystal bloch orbitals , see for example refs . .",
    "alternative approaches were elaborated by shukla _",
    "_ @xcite and in the toulouse group @xcite , where the self - consistent - field ( scf ) equations are solved directly in the wannier representation .",
    "local correlation methods such as the incremental scheme of stoll @xcite and the local hamiltonian formalism of horsch _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and grfenstein _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were applied before to the rigorous determination of both ground - state @xcite and excited - state @xcite properties of infinite systems .",
    "materials under investigation were crystalline lih , lif , and licl @xcite , diamond @xcite , silicon @xcite , beryllium @xcite , carbon , and boron - nitrogen chains @xcite , and _ trans_-polyacetylene",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we extend these studies to the case of ionic oxide compounds and choose mgo as a prototype and , at the same time , relatively simple insulating oxide .",
    "we compute correlation induced corrections to the valence and conduction hf energy bands and find that our final estimate for the fundamental gap is in rather good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "our analysis provides also a clear picture of the major correlation effects that are responsible for the reduction of the hf band gap .",
    "the present study on magnesium oxide should open the way to similar calculations for more complex materials such as the @xmath1 transition - metal oxides .",
    "periodic hf calculations were carried out for crystalline mgo with the crystal package @xcite .",
    "wannier functions associated with the hf valence and low - lying conduction bands were determined with the wannier - boys localization module @xcite of the same program . for conduction - band states , this may be a somewhat tedious task .",
    "however , localized wannier orbitals can also be derived in more difficult cases with band disentanglement techniques @xcite .    for computing",
    "the correlation induced corrections to the valence and conduction bands we adopt the same quasiparticle picture and local hamiltonian formalism as employed in refs . .",
    "the physical reasoning is as follows .",
    "when an electron ( or hole ) is added to the @xmath2-particle system , its surroundings relax and polarize due to the additional charge .",
    "this response of the system lowers the energy it takes to add the extra electron ( or hole ) .",
    "the particle plus the modified surroundings move together through the system in the form of a bloch wave and define a quasiparticle . at the same time , some of the correlation contributions which are present in the ground - state of the @xmath2-particle system are no longer operative in the @xmath3 [ or @xmath4 -particle system , because some excitations are now blocked .",
    "this effect is called loss of ground - state correlation and must be accounted for too @xcite .",
    "a basic feature of our approach is that the correlation treatment is performed on a finite cluster @xmath5 cut from the extended periodic system . with the cluster - in - solid embedding technique elaborated by birkenheuer _",
    "@xcite , the cluster @xmath5 is divided into an active region @xmath6 that supports the local occupied and virtual orbitals entering the post - hf calculations and a spatial `` buffer '' domain @xmath7 including a number of atomic sites ( and basis functions ) whose role is to provide a good representation for the tails of the wannier - like orbitals of the active region @xmath6 .",
    "thus @xmath8 .",
    "all wannier orbitals centered in @xmath7 ( and also the environment ) will be held frozen in the correlation calculations .",
    "the orbital set associated with the finite - size cluster is obtained from the data supplied by the wannier - boys localization module of crystal @xcite .",
    "the interface program @xcite written for this purpose yields in addition an embedding potential corresponding to the frozen environment , i.e. , the surrounding hf electron sea . the detailed procedure for constructing the embedded cluster and the associated orbital set is described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we merely give an outline of this .",
    "the core , valence , and low - lying conduction - band cluster orbitals are generated by projecting the crystal wannier functions onto the set of atomic basis functions attached to the cluster region @xmath5 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are gaussian basis functions centered within the region @xmath5 , @xmath12 represents the inverse overlap matrix for the basis set attached to @xmath5 , @xmath13 is a wannier orbital with index @xmath14 and centered in the unit cell corresponding to the lattice vector @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is its projected counterpart expressed exclusively in terms of basis functions centered in @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath16 functions are neither normalized nor are they orthogonal to each other because of the projection procedure mentioned above",
    ". therefore they are group - wise orthonormalized in the following order : active core , active occupied , active low - lying conduction - band orbitals , buffer core , buffer occupied , buffer low - lying conduction - band orbitals . this way the contamination of the most important types of orbitals is minimized .",
    "group - wise orthonormalization actually means to use schmidt orthogonalization for the inter - group orthogonalization and lwdin orthonormalization inside the groups .",
    "this set of orthonormal orbitals will be denoted by @xmath17 . for the construction of the variational space to be used in the subsequent correlation calculations we follow the prescription suggested by pulay and saeb  @xcite .",
    "so - called virtual projected atomic orbitals ( pao s ) are generated from the gaussian basis functions associated with the _ active _ region @xmath6 by projecting out the occupied and the low - lying conduction - band orbitals @xmath17 via a schmidt orthogonalization scheme .",
    "thereafter , the pao s are lwdin orthonormalized among themselves to facilitate their subsequent use in the correlation calculations .    by making the buffer region @xmath7 sufficiently large the original wannier orbitals of @xmath6",
    "are well represented .",
    "for example , for the wannier orbitals corresponding to the lowest four conduction bands of mgo and centered at a mg site , the six ligands surrounding the given mg ion should be included in @xmath6 because large contributions arise not only from the mg @xmath18 and @xmath19 basis functions but also from the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) oxygen @xmath20,@xmath18 and @xmath0,@xmath19 components .",
    "farther neighbors need not be included in the central region @xmath6 but may be put into the buffer zone @xmath7 because the weight of the longer - range tails is small . whereas a high - quality description can be easily achieved for the wannier orbitals centered in the active region",
    ", the representation of the wannier functions in the buffer zone is less accurate .",
    "the impact of this deficiency on the correlation calculations , however , is completely compensated by an appropriate choice of the embedding potential .",
    "actually , the gaussian orbital representation @xmath21 of the embedding potential is constructed by @xmath22_{\\alpha\\beta } \\ , , \\qquad \\alpha,\\beta\\in{\\cal c}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the self - consistent fock operator from the periodic hf calculation and @xmath24 $ ] is the fock operator associated with the density operator @xmath25 arising from all occupied orbitals @xmath26 which enter the subsequent correlation calculations explicitly .",
    "this way , the correlation calculations are effectively performed in an _",
    "infinite _ frozen hf environment .",
    "the data concerning the occupied and virtual orbitals of the cluster is transferred via the crystal - molpro interface @xcite to the quantum chemistry program molpro @xcite . the same holds for the matrix representation @xmath27 of the self - consitent fock operator of the periodic host system .",
    "the embedding potential itself is constructed according to eqs .",
    "( [ eqvemb ] ) and ( [ eqpfroz ] ) using the matrop module of the molpro program package .",
    "local electron removal and electron addition one - particle configurations can be defined in terms of the set of occupied and virtual orbitals localized within the spatial domain @xmath6 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are annihilation and creation operators for the valence and conduction band @xmath31-spin orbitals @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , and @xmath34 is the single - determinant ground - state wavefunction of the @xmath2-electron system . for clusters which are large enough , the hartree - fock valence and conduction energy bands of the periodic crystal can be recovered by diagonalizing @xmath35-dependent matrices of the following form : @xmath36 here @xmath37 stands for the reference unit cell and @xmath38 denotes the ground - state hf energy of the neutral @xmath2-electron system .",
    "the diagonal terms @xmath39 , @xmath40 in this expression are directly related to the on - site excitation energies within the koopmans approximation @xcite , i.e. , ionization potentials @xmath41 and electron affinities @xmath42 with the latter being negative in the case of mgo .",

    "the operator @xmath48 does not commute with @xmath30 and describes the correlation hole . for a more detailed discussion",
    "we refer to ref . .",
    "alternatively , we may write @xmath49 , where @xmath34 is the scf ground - state and @xmath50 acts like a wave- or moeller operator @xcite . therefore , when correlations are taken into account , the analogue of ( [ eqhkhf ] ) becomes @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy of the @xmath2-particle correlated ground - state @xmath47 ( see also refs . ) .",
    "the correlation hole around an added electron ( or hole ) consists of a short - range and a long - range part .",
    "the short - range part originates from intra - atomic and short - range interatomic relaxation and polarization effects .",
    "we construct the short - range part of the correlation hole by separate orbital optimizations .",
    "thereby the wannier orbital to which the extra electron ( hole ) is attached is kept frozen and the changes within a finite region around it are determined by performing an additional scf calculation @xcite . this is sufficient if electron correlations are weak or moderate .",
    "if they are strong we would have to take into account the fact that changes in the nearby surroundings are decreased when correlation effects among the electrons in that neighborhood are accounted for .",
    "the long - range part of the correlation hole consists of long range polarization of the environment .",
    "the effect of long - range polarization on the diagonal hamiltonian matrix elements is estimated in this paper by applying the approximation of a dielectric continuum . with the known dielectric constant of mgo , @xmath53",
    ", we can directly determine the polarization energy of a charge @xmath54 outside a sphere of radius @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , differential correlation effects related to the existence of a different number of electrons in the system s ground - state and in the @xmath56 excited states are investigated by subsequent configuration - interaction ( ci ) calculations .",
    "magnesium oxide is a prototype closed - shell ionic material that crystallizes under normal conditions in the rocksalt structure .",
    "it is extensively used in materials science as substrate for the epitaxial growth of films of other compounds . in recent years , it has attracted renewed interest because of its use as tunnel barrier in magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite . a different area where mgo attracted attention is optoelectronics .",
    "it turns out that when alloyed with zno , depending on the precise chemical composition , the band gap of the system can be tuned along an interval ranging from 3.3 to 7.8 ev @xcite .",

    "the hartree - fock energy bands are shown in fig.1 .",
    "we employed for our calculations the lattice constant reported by sasaki _",

    "the fundamental gap of the system is 16.20 ev , i.e. , 8.4 ev larger than the experimental value . as illustrated in fig.1 , there is a separation of about 16 ev between the o @xmath20 and o @xmath0 bands .",

    "we calculate the corrections due to long - range polarization by using the experimental value for the static dielectric constant , @xmath107 . since relaxation and polarization effects related to the nearest oxygen neighbors were already accounted for , both , for the valence - band hole states and the conduction - band electrons",
    "( see table i ) and since the core - like electrons of the mg@xmath108 ions can be ignored in these calculations , we set @xmath55 as the average of the radii of the first and second oxygen coordination shells around a localized @xmath0 hole or @xmath18(@xmath19 ) electron : @xmath109 for the o @xmath0 valence - band states , where @xmath59  is the lattice constant @xcite , and @xmath110 for the conduction - band states .",
    "the corrections to the diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian are then @xmath111 about @xmath91 ev for the o @xmath112 bands and @xmath92 ev for the mg @xmath18/@xmath19 bands .",
    "these numbers are also included in table i.    before we discuss band narrowing ( or broadening ) due to correlation effects which also affect the band gap , we consider the loss of ground - state correlations .",
    "the latter leads again to a shift of the center of gravity of the bands . as pointed out in the previous section ,",
    "some of the configurations that are present in the @xmath2-particle ground - state are blocked when an electron is added or removed .",
    "we investigated such correlations by ci calculations with single and double excitations ( cisd ) and discuss first differential effects for the @xmath2 and @xmath113 states .",
    "since the oxygen valence - band wannier orbitals are rather localized , we designed a cluster with a single o ion in the active region . around this central o site",
    "we added one shell of mg ions ( 6 mg s ) and two shells of anions ( @xmath114 o s ) to build the buffer region @xmath7 . in the cisd calculations for the @xmath2 and @xmath113 configurations we correlate the @xmath20 and @xmath0 orbitals of the central o ion .",
    "thereby the occupancy of the hole orbital is kept frozen in the calculations for the @xmath113 states , which is referred to as the frozen hole approximation @xcite .",
    "sets of separately optimized orbitals were used for the hole states of the @xmath113-particle system , as discussed above .",

    "for the o @xmath20 hole states , this correction amounts to 0.99 ev .",
    "one would expect similarly an upwards shift of the conduction bands .",
    "however , the situation is somewhat different here .",
    "when an extra electron is attached to the mg@xmath108 ion , it polarizes the closed shells of the core .",
    "this is the dominant effect now because mg@xmath108 has no valence electrons .",

    ". _ @xcite .",
    "the correction to the rohf mg@xmath116@xmath117mg@xmath108 ionization potential was found to be 0.27 ev in ref . .",
    "a similar differential correlation effect is occuring for the conduction - band states in bulk mgo .",
    "therefore the conduction bands are shifted downwards instead of upwards and a partial cancellation between _ loss of ground - state correlation effects _ for the valence and conduction bands is taking place . the net result is a slight increase of the gap between the valence and conduction bands , in the range of 0.5 ev . among the different contributions discussed here ,",
    "this appears to produce the smallest corrections to the gap .",
    "more advanced calculations for studying such differential correlation effects are left for future work .    to summarize the results listed in table i , relaxation and polarization effects in bulk mgo are responsible for a reduction of the hartree - fock gap by 8.1 ev , which represents about @xmath118 of the difference between the hf and experimental values , 16.2 and 7.8 , respectively .",
    "improved agreement is expected between our results and the experimental data when applying higher - quality basis sets .",
    "we mention in this context that a reduction of 3.8 ev is obtained for the hf gap when going from valence double - zeta to triple - zeta basis sets .",
    "nevertheless , this large energy difference is mainly related to the very poor representation of the conduction - band states in the calculations with double - zeta basis functions and such effects will be less substantial by further extension of the basis sets .",
    "we also keep in mind that differential correlation effects due to the existence of a different number of electrons in the system s ground - state and in the @xmath56 excited states determine a small correction in the opposite direction , i.e. , a slight increase of the fundamental gap .",

    "the results are given in table iii in parentheses .",
    "the corrections due to relaxation and polarization at the four nearest o neighbors are very small , 0.01 to 0.02 ev . the effect of these corrections is to reduce somewhat the absolute values of the nn hoppings .",

    "the measured width of the o @xmath0 bands is about 6.5 ev @xcite .",
    "the hf valence - band width is 5.50 ev and inclusion of local correlations leads to a slight broadening of the o @xmath0 bands , which brings the _ ab initio _ result in good agreement with the experiment . for comparison ,",
    "density - functional calculations within the local density approximation and using the same gaussian basis sets as in the hf calculations predict a width of 4.68 ev for the o @xmath0 bands .",

    "corrections of 0.04 ev for @xmath127 and 0.01 ev for @xmath128 ( or @xmath129 ) , see table iii , imply an upwards shift of the o @xmath0 bands at the @xmath124 point and a narrowing of the fundamental gap by about 0.30 ev . for the mg @xmath83 conduction - band complex such changes at the @xmath124 point",
    "are smaller because the correlation induced corrections to the @xmath130 and @xmath83 inter - site matrix elements are lower .",
    "we have analyzed the different correlation contributions to the energy gap of mgo and to the widths of the conduction and valence bands .",
    "this was done within the quasiparticle description . as regards correlation effects we have distinguished between relaxation and polarization around an electron or hole added to the ( neutral ) ground - state .",
    "the net result is a reduction of the hartree - fock gap from 16.2 ev to a value of 8.1 ev .",
    "this has to be compared with a measured energy gap of 7.8 ev . within the local density approximation ( lda )",
    "to density functional theory a gap of 5.0 ev is found .",
    "this is not surprising since lda is known to produce too small gaps for insulators .",
    "the calculations were performed with triple - zeta basis sets . since on the hartree - fock level",
    "the calculated gap differs for double- and triple - zeta basis sets by 3.8 ev , one may consider the good agreement with the experimental gap as somewhat fortuitous .",
    "triple - zeta basis sets are known , however , to produce reliable results in quantum chemistry and therefore a further extension of the basis set should keep the corrections small .",
    "presently we are not able to work with larger basis sets .",
    "it was shown that a large contribution to the correlation induced corrections to the fundamental gap comes from on - site and nearest - neighbor relaxation , i.e. , from the immediate neighborhood of the added particle",
    ". but also the long - range part of the polarization generated by the extra particle contributes substantially to the reduction of the hf gap .",
    "this long - range part can be treated in a continuum approximation thereby using the known dielectric constant of mgo .",
    "the so - called loss of ground - state correlations makes a small contribution in mgo .",
    "the reason is that the conduction - band wannier orbitals have predominant mg @xmath18 or @xmath19 character .",
    "the added electron will essentially go thus to a mg site where it polarizes the closed @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 shells .",
    "this effect reduces the gap and counteracts the loss of ground - state correlations which occurs when an electron is removed ( hole state ) and therefore can no longer contribute to the correlations of the remaining ones .",
    "finally , also changes in the widths of the bands influence the energy gap .",
    "one surprising effect which we found is an enhancement of the width of the valence bands when local correlations are taken into account .",
    "this is the opposite one expects since correlations lead usually to band narrowing instead of broadening .",
    "it results from a slight bending of nearest - neighbor @xmath0 orbitals towards a o@xmath72 site when we account for correlations .",
    "the bending of the nearest - neighbor ligand orbitals increases the wavefunction overlap and hence facilitates the hopping .",
    "the present results prove the usefulness of band calculations based on quantum chemical techniques .",
    "they allow for well controlled approximations and a transparent interpretation of the different microscopic processes which determine the size of the energy gap and the widths of the bands .",
