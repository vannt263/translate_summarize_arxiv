    "thermonuclear flames fronts are ubiquitous in stellar models of type ia supernova , x - ray bursts , and shell flashes of intermediate stars .",
    "flame fronts propagating through carbon and carbon - oxygen compositions are prevalent is in type ia supernova models ( timmes & woosley 1992 ; khokhlov 1995 ; boisseau et al . 1996 ; niemeyer & kerstein 1997 ) , while flame fronts propagating through helium compositions play a pivotal role in x - ray burst models ( fryxell & woosley 1982 ; taam 1987 ; taam , woosley , & lamb 1996 ; zingale et al . 2000 ) and shell flash models of intermediate - mass stars ( schwarzschild & hrm 1965 ; paczynski 1974 ; iben 1977 ; clayton & de marco 1997 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on flame fronts propagating through helium compositions .    in most of the x - ray burst and thin shell flash models ,",
    "the flame front operates in a layer that is thin compared to the radius of the star .",
    "local temperature perturbations in these thin layers become amplified due to the nonlinear temperature dependence of the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "ignition of the flame front probably takes place at an individual point , or a small set of points , rather than simultaneously throughout the entire layer as spherically symmetric models require .",
    "the flame front which subsequently propagates through the thin layer may be a detonation , which travels faster than the local sound speed , or a deflagration , which travels slower than the local sound speed .",
    "which type of flame front initially propagates depends primarily on the prevailing thermodynamic conditions and velocity fields . roughly speaking ,",
    "the formation of a detonation is suppressed in the presence of strong temperature fluctuations on scales smaller than @xmath8 times the detonation width ( montgomery et al .",
    "the detonation or deflagration propagates both laterally around the star and vertically through the thin layer .",
    "the duration of a stellar event , or the observed rise time of the luminosity , may be related in a fundamental way to the speed at which the flame front propagates through the thin layer ( e.g. , fryxell & woosley 1982 ) .",
    "neutron stars which accrete hydrogen - rich material from a binary companion , or from the interstellar medium , end up with a thin layer of helium - rich fuel on their surface .",
    "the helium - rich fuel may be spread evenly over the entire neutron star , or the fuel may be confined to the polar regions if the magnetic field is sufficiently strong . for a relatively slow ( @xmath9 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 y@xmath12 ) accretion rate that is spherically symmetric , a thick layer of helium ( @xmath0 10@xmath13 cm ) develops before ignition .",
    "the density at the base of the accreted layer reaches @xmath0 10@xmath1 g @xmath2 and the temperature reaches @xmath0 10@xmath14 k ( woosley & taam 1976 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ) . at these thermodynamic conditions a planar detonation propagates in the lateral direction ( perpendicular to the direction of the gravitational force ) at a speed of @xmath15 10@xmath16 cm s@xmath12 , while a purely laminar deflagration propagates in the lateral direction at a speed of @xmath17 10@xmath18 cm s@xmath12 ( timmes 1999 ) . for larger accretion rates ( ) , a thinner layer of helium ( @xmath0 10@xmath19 cm )",
    "is deposited before ignition .",
    "the density at the base of this accreted layer is @xmath0 10@xmath18 g @xmath2 and the temperature reaches @xmath0 10@xmath14 k ( wallace , woosley , & weaver 1982 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ) . for these thermodynamic conditions ,",
    "the lateral speed of a self - sustained detonation is @xmath15 10@xmath16 cm s@xmath12 , while a purely laminar deflagration propagates in the lateral direction at a speed of @xmath20 10@xmath13 cm s@xmath12 ( timmes 1999 ) .",
    "the vast difference between these estimates for the planar detonation speeds and the purely laminar deflagration speeds imply very different predictions for the rise time of an x - ray burst ( e.g. , fryxell & woosley 1982 ) .",
    "the thin shell helium flash which occurs during the advanced evolutionary stages of intermediate - mass stars ( schwarzschild & hrm 1965 ) results from nuclear burning being unable to raise the overlying hydrogen envelope sufficiently to extinguish the reactions .",
    "a drastic temperature rise at near constant pressure ensues . shortly after reaching its peak temperature , however , the material does expand and cool on a rapid timescale .",
    "note that in contrast to the neutron star example , the layer of fuel in the thin shell helium flash is located inside a star rather than on the surface of a star .",
    "we will focus on a single model of a helium shell flash , namely , the m @xmath21 core of a 7 m@xmath22 star studied by iben ( 1977 ) .",
    "other models tested give qualitatively similar results .",
    "typical shell radii , densities and temperatures at the onset of this thin shell helium flash model are , , and t @xmath0 2@xmath2310@xmath1 k , respectively . for these thermodynamic conditions , a self - sustained detonation propagates in the lateral direction at @xmath15 10@xmath16 cm s@xmath12 , and a laminar deflagration propagates laterally at @xmath20 10 cm s@xmath12 ( timmes 1999 ) .",
    "purely laminar deflagrations and planar znd detonations ( zeldovich ( see ostriker 1992 ) ; von neumann 1942 ; dring 1943 ) represent the simplest one - dimensional , steady - state realizations of propagating burning fronts .",
    "hydrodynamic instabilities in deflagrations , some of which are intrinsic to three - dimensional propagating fronts and some of which are related to the buoyancy of the hot burning products with respect to the cold background in the radial direction , give rise to growing perturbations and  unless stabilized by non - linear effects  turbulence .",
    "these instabilities deform the combustion surface , potentially altering the structure of the reacting layers . for deflagrations",
    ", these instabilities generally increase the rate at which nuclear energy is released .",
    "the deformed flame front propagates at a speed faster than a purely laminar flame front as long as the surface area increase dominates over the reduction of local energy generation induced by hydrodynamic strain . for a detonation",
    ", these hydrodynamic instabilities generally do not increase either the energy released from burning or the self - sustained detonation speed ( e.g. , fickett & davis 1979 ) .",
    "models for the non - linear evolution of unstable or turbulent combustion fronts often involve statistical tools , and the choice of an appropriate tool requires knowledge of the burning regime of the combustion front .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the regimes of helium burning fronts in the presence of buoyancy - driven ( convective ) turbulence . a simple dimensional comparison of the relevant length and speed scales of buoyancy - driven turbulence , znd helium detonations , and laminar helium deflagrations determine whether the combustion front is in the flamelet regime , distributed burning regime , or neither .",
    "it will always be assumed in this paper that convective stirring dominates over all other instabilities intrinsic to the flame front .",
    "while cellular instabilities behind the detonation front may be relevant in some contexts ( fickett & davis 1979 ; merzhanov & rumanov 1999 ) , they will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "the physical properties of laminar helium deflagrations , which are primarily determined by a balance between nuclear energy generation and the transport of internal energy , have been evaluated by timmes ( 1999 ) for a large grid of upstream densities and temperatures .",
    "we will use the results of this survey for values of the laminar deflagration speeds @xmath24 , widths @xmath25 , and density contrasts @xmath26 between the unburned fuel and its ash .",
    "the density of the ash is smaller than the density of the unburned fuel because the density declines behind a subsonic flame front .",
    "there are several plausible definitions for the width of the deflagration .",
    "we consider three pragmatic definitions , each of which can be measured by resolved calculations of laminar helium deflagrations .",
    "the first definition we consider is the distance between where the temperature is 10% above the upstream temperature and where the nuclear energy generation attains its maximum value .",
    "this width is called the reactive width and is denoted @xmath27 .",
    "the second width definition we consider is the distance between where the temperature is 10% above the upstream temperature and where the temperature reaches 90% of its downstream value .",
    "this width is called the thermal width and is denoted @xmath28 . the third definition of a deflagration s width that we consider is the distance between where the composition has its upstream values and where the downstream composition first reaches its final state .",
    "this width is called the composition width and is denoted @xmath29 . for laminar helium deflagrations ,",
    "the reactive widths @xmath27 are the smallest widths .",
    "the thermal widths @xmath28 are usually slightly larger than the reactive widths @xmath30 , depending on the upstream thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the compositions widths @xmath29 are usually the largest widths , ranging from being 1.210 times larger than the thermal widths , depending mainly on the upstream density .",
    "we will use the @xmath31 in our analysis , but qualitatively similar results are obtained if the differences in the widths are taken into account .",
    "the pressure scale height of a hydrostatically stratified helium layer in some cases is comparable to the width of a helium combustion front ( e.g. , bildsten 1995 ) , and should be included in any length scale comparisons .",
    "the pressure scale height is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the scalar pressure , @xmath34 is the mass density , and @xmath35 is the acceleration due to gravity . for the x - ray burst case we assumed a @xmath36 neutron star with a radius of @xmath37 cm , while for the thin shell instability we the aforementioned model from iben ( 1977 ) that is characterized by @xmath38 , @xmath39 cm .",
    "the density in both x - ray burst and thin shell instability cases is left as a free parameter , permitting a classification of the helium burning regimes as a function of density .",
    "the amplitude of convective velocity fluctuations on large scales can be estimated by evaluating the terminal rise velocity of buoyant plumes with a diameter @xmath40 ( layzer 1955 ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the local sound speed , and @xmath43 is the ratio of specific heats .    for the purpose of classifying turbulent burning regimes",
    ", we are interested mainly in the amplitude of turbulent velocity fluctuations at the scale of the combustions front s width ( niemeyer & kerstein 1997 ) .",
    "assuming that the convectively driven , large scale , fluctuations establish a turbulent cascade with the exponent @xmath44 , we can write @xmath45    the value of @xmath44 for buoyancy - driven turbulent cascades is not unambiguously agreed upon .",
    "it appears reasonable at present to use either @xmath46 for kolmogorov scaling , or @xmath47 for bolgiano - obukhov scaling ( niemeyer & kerstein 1997 ) .",
    "we will assume @xmath48 kolmogorov scaling for the remainder of this paper .",
    "deflagrations under astrophysical conditions are characterized by the thermal diffusivity @xmath49 dominating over all other microscopic transport coefficients , such as viscosity @xmath50 and mass diffusivity @xmath51 . in terms of the dimensionless numbers representing the transport properties of the fluid",
    ", the prandtl number @xmath52 is very small , and the lewis number @xmath53 is very large . as a result of this disparity between the prandtl and lewis numbers the conventional classification of turbulent burning regimes ( e.g. ,",
    "bradley 1993 ) , which is based exclusively on time scale criteria , is inappropriate ( niemeyer & kerstein 1997 ) .",
    "it is more appropriate in such astrophysical conditions to combine the length scales and time scales , and compare a turbulent diffusivity @xmath54 with the thermal diffusivity @xmath49 .",
    "note the turbulent diffusivity is a function of the length scale being examined . since @xmath55 is a growing function of length scale for most turbulent cascades , it is sufficient for our purposes to consider the largest scale relevant for the flame structure , the flame width @xmath25 .",
    "one may expect that a change of burning regimes occurs when @xmath56 or , equivalently , when @xmath57 .",
    "it must be stressed that these dimensional relationships may have potentially large dimensionless coefficients that can only be determined by experiment or direct numerical simulation .    the regime where @xmath58 is generally called the flamelet regime ( peters 1984 ; clavin 1994 ) .",
    "this regime is characterized by a nearly unperturbed laminar flame structure on small scales and the deformation of the flame surface by turbulent eddies on larger scales .",
    "the growth of the flame surface area as a result of turbulent wrinkling increases the energy deposited by nuclear burning , which causes the deformed flame surface to propagate faster than the purely laminar flame front .",
    "this turbulent flame speed @xmath59 should scale linearly with the speed of the fastest ( and thus largest ) turbulent eddies @xmath60 if the conditions for the flamelet region are to hold . in the astrophysical cases of interest here , a reasonable estimate is @xmath61 .",
    "a number of expressions for the turbulent flame speed @xmath62 as a function of the turbulent velocity fluctuations have been proposed ( e.g. , williams 1985 ; yakhot 1988 ; pocheau 1994 ; shy et al .",
    "1996 ) , but a well - founded consensus has yet to emerge .    the regime where @xmath63 is known as the distributed burning regime ( peters 1984 ; clavin 1994 ) .",
    "this regime is characterized by a deformation of the flame surface even at small scales .",
    "modeling attempts in this regime are severely hampered by the overlapping length and time scales between the turbulent energy transport and nuclear energy generation .",
    "damkhler ( 1940 ) proposed a simple re - normalization of the order - of - magnitude estimate for the laminar flame .",
    "this re - normalization assumes a vanishing influence of the turbulence on the energy generation rate , which may be unrealistic for distributed burning under astrophysical conditions .",
    "peters ( 1999 ) gives an approach to extend flamelet regime models into the distributed burning regime .",
    "the length and speed scales of helium burning are shown in figures [ lengths ] and [ speeds ] , respectively .",
    "each plot has the upstream ( unburned ) mass density on the @xmath64-axis , the appropriate scaling variable on the @xmath65-axis .",
    "each curve in the figure is for an upstream composition of pure helium , and an upstream temperature of 10@xmath1 k. there are composition effects ( the helium mass fraction ) and upstream thermodynamic effects ( how cold the unburnt fuel is ) which determine the exact placement of each curve .",
    "however , the magnitude of these two effects are small compared to the scale of the @xmath65-axis and the order of the analysis .",
    "the red curve in figure [ lengths ] shows the purely laminar flame reactive width @xmath27 from the timmes ( 1999 ) survey .",
    "curves for the thermal widths lie almost on top of the red curve , while curves for the composition widths would be displaced toward larger lengths for a given density .",
    "the green curve gives the pressure scale height for the x - ray burst case , while the blue curve gives the pressure scale height for the thin shell case .",
    "both pressure scale height curves are from equation ( [ pscale ] ) .",
    "the red curve in figure [ speeds ] shows the laminar flame speed from the timmes ( 1999 ) survey .",
    "the green curve gives the buoyancy speed from equation ( [ vbuoy ] ) .",
    "since the buoyancy speed depends only on local thermodynamic conditions and the local laminar flame properties , the buoyancy speed is identical for both the x - ray burst and the thin shell instability cases .",
    "the light blue curve gives the turbulent speed at the scale of the laminar flame s reactive width for the x - ray burst case , while the dark blue curve gives the same quantity for the thin shell instability .",
    "both turbulent speed curves , evaluated at the scale of the laminar flame reactive width , are calculated from equation ( [ vturb ] ) .",
    "figure [ speeds ] shows the curve for the thin shell turbulent speed crosses the curve for the laminar flame speed at @xmath4 g @xmath2 . at smaller densities the turbulent velocities on the scale of the laminar flame width are larger than the speed of a purely laminar deflagration , which corresponds to the distributed burning regime . in this case",
