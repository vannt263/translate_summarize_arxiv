    "[ fig1]a and sec .",
    "3 ) . the grumpv1 data provides a high resolution gridded population data at @xmath12 arc - second , equivalent to a grid of @xmath13 at the equator line .",
    "the emissions dataset is obtained from the _ vulcan project _ ( vp ) compiled at arizona state university @xcite .",
    "the vp provides fossil fuel co@xmath10 emissions in the continental us at a spatial resolution of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 grid ) from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the data are separated according to economic sectors and activities ( see sec . 3 for details )",
    ": commercial , industrial , and residential sectors ( obtained from country - level aggregation of non - geocoded sources and non - electricity producing sources from geocoded location ) , electricity production ( geolocated sources associated with the production of electricity such as thermal power stations ) , onroad vehicles ( mobile transport using designated roadways such as automobiles , buses , and motorcycles ) , nonroad vehicles ( mobile surface sources that do not travel on roadways such as boats , trains , snowmobiles ) , aircraft ( airports , geolocated sources associated with taxi , takeoff , and landing cycles associated with air travel , and aircraft , gridded sources associated with the airborne component of air travel ) , and cement industry .",
    "we analyze the annual average of emissions in @xmath18 for the total of all sectors combined ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) and each sector separately ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath18 data ( rather than @xmath11 as in population ) reflects the constraint that it is the only year for which the quantification of co@xmath10 emissions has been achieved at the scale of individual factories , powerplants , roadways and neighborhoods and on an hourly basis @xcite .    to define the boundary of cities ,",
    "we use the notion of spatial continuity by aggregating settlements that are close to each other into cities @xcite .",
    "such a procedure , called the city clustering algorithm ( cca ) , considers cities as constituted of contiguous commercial and residential areas for which we know also the emissions of co@xmath10 from the vulcan project dataset . by using two microscopically defined datasets , we are able to match precisely the population of each agglomeration to its rate of co@xmath10 emissions by constructing the urban agglomerations from the bottom up without resorting to predefined administrative boundaries .",
    "we also use the us income dataset available in ascii format by us census bureau @xcite for the year @xmath11 .",
    "this dataset provides the mean household income per capita for the @xmath19 us counties . for each county , we combined the income data and the administrative boundaries @xcite in order to relate them with the geolocated datasets ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c and sec .",
    "we first apply the cca to construct cities aggregating population sites @xmath20 at site @xmath21 .",
    "the procedure depends on a population threshold @xmath22 and a distance threshold @xmath23 . if @xmath24 , the site @xmath21 is populated .",
    "the length @xmath23 represents a cutoff distance between the sites to consider them as spatially contiguous , i.e. we aggregate all nearest - neighbor sites which are at distances smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "thus a cca cluster or city is defined by populated sites within a distance smaller than @xmath23 as seen schematically in fig .",
    "starting from an arbitrary seed , we add all populated neighbors at distances to the cluster smaller than @xmath23 until no more sites can be added to the cluster .",
    "the scaling laws produced by the cca depend weakly on @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "and we are interested in a region of the parameters where the scaling laws are independent of these parameters .",
    "this aggregation criterion based on the geographical continuity of development was shown to provide strong evidence of zipf s law in the us and uk @xcite in agreement with established results in urban sciences @xcite . for cut - off lengths above @xmath25 , it was shown that cca clusters verify the zipf s law and the zipf s exponent is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "next , we first present results for aggregated clusters at @xmath25 , and then show the robustness of the scaling laws over a larger range of parameter space .    in order to assign the total co@xmath10 emissions to a given cca cluster ,",
    "we superimpose the obtained cluster to the co@xmath10 emissions dataset .",
    "if a populated site composing a cca cluster falls inside a co@xmath10 site , we assign to the populated site the corresponding co@xmath10 emissions proportional to its area @xmath26 , considering that the emissions density is constant across the co@xmath10 site of @xmath27 . for a given cca cluster ,",
    "we then calculate the population ( pop ) and co@xmath10 emissions by adding the values of the constitutive sites of the cluster .",
    "* scaling of emissions with city size .",
    "* figure [ fig4 ] shows the correlation between the total annual co@xmath10 emissions and pop for each cca cluster for @xmath25 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we perform a non - parametric regression with bootstrapped @xmath30 confidence bands @xcite ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "we find that the emissions grow with the size of the cities , on average , faster than the expected linear behavior .",
    "the result can be approximated over many orders of magnitudes by a power - law yielding the following allometric scaling law :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the allometric scaling exponent obtained from ordinary least squares ( ols ) analysis @xcite for this particular set of parameters @xmath25 and @xmath28 ( see sec . 3 for details on ols and on the estimation of the exponent error ,",
    "all emissions are measured in log base @xmath35 of metric tonnes of carbon per year ) .",
    "in addition , we investigate the robustness of the allometric exponent as a function of the thresholds @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ fig5]a shows @xmath36 as a function of the cut - off length @xmath23 for different values of population threshold @xmath22 ( @xmath37 , @xmath11 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ) . we observe that @xmath36 increases with @xmath23 until a saturation value which is relatively independent of @xmath22 . performing an average of the exponent in the plateau region with @xmath40 over @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we find superlinear allometry indicating an inefficient emissions law for cities : doubling the city population results in an average increment of @xmath42 in co@xmath10 emissions , rather than the expected isometric @xmath43 .",
    "this positive non - extensivity suggests that the high productivity found in larger cities @xcite is done at the expense of a disproportionally larger amount of emissions compared to small cities .",
    "figure [ fig5]b investigates the emissions of cities as deconstructed by different sectors and activities of the economy .",
    "we perform non - parametric regression with bootstrapped @xmath30 confidence bands of @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for @xmath44 and @xmath25 by each sector ) versus @xmath23 and we find that the exponents for different sectors saturate to an approximate constant value for @xmath45 .",
    "we assign an average exponent , @xmath46 over the plateau per sector as seen in table [ tab1 ] . the sectors with higher exponents ( less efficient ) are residential , industrial , commercial and electric production with @xmath47 , above the average for the total emissions .",
    "onroad vehicles contribute with a superlinear exponent @xmath48 , yet , below the total average .",
    "the exponent for nonroad vehicles is also below the average at @xmath49 , while aircraft sector displays approximate isometric scaling with @xmath50 .",
    "cement production displays sublinear scaling @xmath51 , although the reported data is less significant than the rest with only @xmath52 datapoints of cities available .",
    "we further investigate the dependence of the allometric exponent @xmath36 on the income per capita of cities by aggregating the cca clusters by their income ( inc ) and plotting the obtained @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( see also fig . [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we find an inverted u - shape relationship , which is analogous to the so - called environmental kuznets curve ( ekc ) @xcite .",
    "we observe that @xmath36 initially increases for cities with low income per capita until an income turning point located at $ @xmath54 per capita ( in @xmath11 us dollar ) .",
    "after the turning point , @xmath36 decreases indicating an environmental improvement for large - income cities .",
    "however , the allometric exponent remains always larger than one regardless of the income level ( except for the lowest income ) indicating that almost all large cities are less efficient than small ones , no matter their income .    * comparison with msa . *",
    "a further important issue in the scaling of cities is the dependence on the way they are defined @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of interest to compare our results with definitions based on administrative boundaries such as the commonly used metropolitan statistical areas ( msa ) @xcite provided by the us census bureau @xcite .",
    "msas are constructed from administrative boundaries aggregating neighboring counties which are related socioeconomically via , for instance , large commuting patterns .",
    "a drawback is that msas are available only for a subset ( @xmath55 cites ) of the most populated cities in the us , and therefore can represent only the upper tail of the distribution @xcite ( see sec . 3 for details ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that the msa construction violates the expected extensivity @xcite between the land area occupied by the msa and their population since msa overestimates the area of the small agglomerations @xcite .",
    "this is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , where we find the regression :    @xmath56    with @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this approximate square - root law implies that the density is not constant across the msas :    @xmath60    on the contrary , cca clusters capture precisely the occupied area of the agglomeration leading to the expected extensive relation between land area and population as seen also in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] :    @xmath61    with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with small dispersion @xmath64 , implying that the density of population of cca clusters is well - defined ( extensive ) , _ i.e. _ it is constant across population sizes ,    @xmath65    in summary , while the cca displays almost isometric relation between population and area , the msa shows a sublinear scaling between these two measures . as a consequence ,",
    "the emission of cca is independent of the population density , as expected . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] , the msa leads to a superlinear scaling between them , @xmath66 .",
    "the non - extensive character of the msa areas is due to the fact that many msas are constituted by aggregating small disconnected clusters resulting in large unpopulated areas inside the msa .",
    "this is exemplified in some typical msas plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , such as las vegas , albuquerque , flagstaff and others .",
    "the plots show that a large msa area is associated to a series of disconnected small counties , like it is seen , for instance , in the region near las vegas .",
    "this clustering of disconnected small cities inside a msa results into an overestimation of the emissions associated with the las vegas msa , for instance .",
    "the same pattern is verified for many small cities , specially in the mid - west of us , as seen in the other panels . for some large cities , like ny",
    ", the agglomeration captures similar shapes as in the occupied areas obtained with cca , although it is also clearly seen that the area of the ny msa contains many unoccupied regions .",
    "therefore , the occupied area of a typical msa is overestimated in comparison to the area that is actually populated as captured by the cca , the bias is larger for small cities than larger ones .",
    "this endogeneity bias leads to an overestimation of the co@xmath10 emissions of the small cities as compared to large cities .",
    "consequently , we find a smaller allometric exponent for msa than cca with an almost extensive relation :    @xmath67    with @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 = 0.71 , see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with previous studies of scaling emissions of msa by fragkias _",
    "@xcite , who used msas and found a linear scaling between emissions and size of the cities , and also rybski _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who used administrative boundaries to define @xmath71 cities in @xmath72 countries .",
    "table [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] summarize the results of cca and msa cities .",
    "thus , the measurement bias in the msas leads to smaller @xmath36 found for msa as compared with cca , since low - density msas have relatively large areas .",
    "hence , the cca results , which are not subject to that endogeneity bias , should be considered the main source of information on emissions .",
    "they show a positive link between emissions and population size as well as the expected extensive behavior of the occupied land .",
    "this analysis calls the attention to use the proper definition of cities when the scaling behavior of small cities needs to be accurately represented .",
    "indeed , this issue arises in the controversy regarding the distribution of city size for small cities since the distribution of administrative cities ( such as us places ) are found broadly lognormal ( that is , a power law in the tail that deviates into a log - gaussian for small cities ) @xcite , while the distribution of geography - based agglomerations like cca is found to be zipf distributed along all cities ( power - law for all cities ) @xcite .",
    "in general , we expect that when the scaling obtained by cca is extensive , then any agglomeration of cca such as msa , should give rise to extensive scaling too . however , when there are intrinsic long - range spatial correlations in the data ( like in non - extensive systems with @xmath73 ) , agglomerating populated clusters ( as done with msa ) may give different allometric exponents depending on the particular administrative boundary used to define cities .",
    "it is of interest to note that , beyond msa @xcite , there are other administrative boundaries used in the literature to define cities , like for instance us - places studied in @xcite .",
    "this measurement bias is a generic property of any non - extensive system , such as a physical system at a critical point .",
    "thus , scaling laws obtained using administrative boundaries to define cities which cluster data in a somehow arbitrary manner may need to be taken with caution .    in summary",
    ", we find that cca urban clusters in the us have sub - optimal co@xmath10 emissions as measured by a superlinear allometric exponent @xmath9 .",
    "the exponent @xmath36 decreases for cities with low and high income per capita in agreement with an ekc hypothesis @xcite . from the point of view of allometry",
    ", larger cities may not represent an improvement of co@xmath10 emissions as compared with smaller cities .",

    "<S> * we study how urban quality evolves as a result of carbon dioxide emissions as urban agglomerations grow . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a bottom - up approach combining two unprecedented microscopic data on population and carbon dioxide emissions in the continental us . </S>",
    "<S> we first aggregate settlements that are close to each other into cities using the city clustering algorithm ( cca ) defining cities beyond the administrative boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> then , we use data on @xmath0 emissions at a fine geographic scale to determine the total emissions of each city . </S>",
    "<S> we find a superlinear scaling behavior , expressed by a power - law , between @xmath0 emissions and city population with average allometric exponent @xmath1 across all cities in the us . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that the high productivity of large cities is done at the expense of a proportionally larger amount of emissions compared to small cities . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our results are substantially different from those obtained by the standard administrative definition of cities , _ i.e. _ metropolitan statistical area ( msa ) . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , msas display isometric scaling emissions and we argue that this discrepancy is due to the overestimation of msa areas . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that allometric studies based on administrative boundaries to define cities may suffer from endogeneity bias . </S>",
    "<S> *    allometry was originally introduced in the context of evolutionary theory @xcite to describe the correlation between relative dimensions of parts of body size , for instance brain size in mammals , with changes in overall body size . in a classical result </S>",
    "<S> , kleiber showed that metabolic rate , @xmath2 , and the body mass , @xmath3 , of a large range of mammal s are related by an allometric power - law @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the allometric exponent and @xmath6 is a constant @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in analogy with biological systems , bettencourt _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that cities across us obey allometric relations with population size . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a large class of human activities can be grouped into three categories according to the value of the allometric exponent : ( a ) isometric behavior ( linear , non - allometric or extensive , @xmath7 ) typically reflects the scaling with population size of individual human needs , like the number of jobs , houses , and water consumption . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) allometric sublinear behavior ( hipoallometric , non - extensive , @xmath8 ) implies an economy of scale in the quantity of interest because its _ per capita _ measurement decreases with population size . </S>",
    "<S> hipoallometry is found , for example , in the number of gasoline stations , length of electrical cables , and road surfaces ( material and infrastructure ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) superlinear behavior ( hyperallometric , non - extensive , @xmath9 ) emerges whenever the pattern of social activity has significant influence in the urban indicator . </S>",
    "<S> wages , income , growth domestic product , bank deposits , as well as rates of invention measured by patents and employment in creative sectors , display a superlinear increase with population size . </S>",
    "<S> these superlinear scaling laws indicate that larger cities are associated with optimal levels of human productivity and quality of life ; doubling the city size leads to a larger - than - double increment in productivity and life standards @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the optimal productivity of large cities raises the question of the consequences of urban growth to environmental quality . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is intensely debated whether large cities can be considered environmentally `` green '' , implying that their productivity is associated with lower than expected greenhouse gases ( ghg ) and pollutant emissions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , some of these studies report that the level of commuting has a major contributing to the relation between ghg emissions and city size @xcite . as a consequence , compact cities would be more green due to the attenuation of the average commuting length . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , however , gaign _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite suggested that compact cities might not be as environmentally friendly as it was thought , mainly because increasing - density policies obligate firms and households to change place . </S>",
    "<S> this relocation of the urban system then generates a higher level of pollution . in this context , here we study the allometric laws associated with a particular type of ghg emissions from human activity by studying the relation between co@xmath10 emissions of cities as a function of population size . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a bottom - up approach combining two unprecedented microscopic data on population and carbon dioxide emissions in the continental us . </S>",
    "<S> we first define the boundaries of cities using the city clustering algorithm ( cca ) @xcite which are then used to calculate the co@xmath10 emissions . </S>",
    "<S> we find a superlinear allometric scaling law between emissions and city size . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore different sectors and activities of the economy finding superlinear behavior in most of the sectors . </S>",
    "<S> our results pertain only emissions of co@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it will be desirable to extend it to the rest of ghgs . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that large cities may not provide as many environmental advantages as previously thought @xcite . </S>"
