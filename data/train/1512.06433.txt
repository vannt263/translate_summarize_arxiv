    "photometric observations of transiting exoplanets ( teps ) provide accurate relative sizes of their configurations , which are important for understanding their formation and evolution ( charbonneau et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the monitoring of transiting exoplanet allows to improve its physical parameters as well as to study existence of other planets in the system by analysis of the transit timing variation ( ttv ) and transit duration variation ( tdv ) ( agol et al .",
    "2005 ; holman @xmath8 murray 2005 ; kipping 2009a , b ) .",
    "moreover , the transits provide a possibility to learn the oblateness of the planets ( seager @xmath8 hui 2002 ; carter @xmath8 winn 2010 ) and to make thermal mapping of their surfaces ( knutson et al . 2007 ) .    during the last two decades",
    "the number of discovered and studied exoplanets rapidly increased as a consequence mostly of automated surveys as superwasp ( street et al .",
    "2004 ) , corot ( baglin et al .",
    "2007 ) , hatnet ( bakos et al . 2004 ) , tres ( alonso et al . 2004 ) , xo ( mccullough et al . 2005 ) , kelt ( pepper et al . 2007 ) , ogle ( udalski et al . 1998 ) and _ kepler _ ( koch et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the considerable part of the newly discovered exoplanets are hot jupiters .",
    "these are a class of extrasolar planets whose characteristics are similar to jupiter , but which have higher surface temperatures because they orbit very close ( 0.0150.1 au ) to their parent ( f , g and k - type ) stars .",
    "that is why the probability to observe transits of hot jupiters is bigger compared to other known types of planets .",
    "morerover , they are the easiest extrasolar planets for confirmation via the radial - velocity method , because the induced oscillations in the star motion are relatively large and rapid . hot jupiters are gas giants with low density although there are examples which are denser than jupiter : wasp-18 ( 7 times the density of jupiter , southworth et al .",
    "2009 ) and hat - p-2 ( 9 times the density of jupiter , pal et al . 2010 ) .",
    "it is supposed that hot jupiters have migrated to their present positions after their formation at a distance from the star beyond the frost line .",
    "the most investigations show that they appear to be alone or accompanied by other planetary bodies on wide orbits ( steffen et al .",
    "2012 ) but the studies of the _ kepler _ candidates for hot planets reveal that some of them exhibit periodic variations in transit timing ( szabo et al .",
    "these multiple - planet systems may provide some constraints on planet formation and migration theories ( podlewska @xmath8 szuszkiewicz 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , the distribution of planet period ratios shows strange clumping around the low - order resonances ( fabrycky et al .",
    "2014 ) . on the other hand",
    "the loneliness of the gas giants is in favor of inward migration theories of massive outer planets through planet - planet scattering caused by mutual dynamical perturbations ( weidenschilling @xmath8 marzari 1996 ; rasio @xmath8 ford 1996 ) .",
    "that is why the study of hot jupiters is important area of the modern astrophysics .",
    "hat - p-24b was discovered as tep on the base of hatnet ( hungarian - made automated telescope network ) photometric observations and confirmed by keck spectral observations ( kipping et al .",
    "it orbits the f8v star gsc 077401441 ( mass of 1.191 m@xmath9 , radius of 1.317 r@xmath9 , effective temperature 6373 k , metallicity of [ fe / h ] = 0.16 ) with a period p = 3.3552464 days on slightly eccentric orbit ( @xmath10 = 0.052 ) with semiaxis _ a _ = 0.04641 au ( kipping et al .",
    "hat - p-24b is classified as an inflated hot jupiter with a mass of 0.681 m@xmath5 and radius of 1.243 r@xmath5 ( mean density @xmath6 = 0.439 g @xmath7 ) .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) obtained three complete transit light curves of hat - p-24b in 20102012.they derived slightly bigger orbital period and larger planet radius @xmath4 = 1.364 r@xmath5 .",
    "we carried out observations and study of hat - p-24b in order to obtain new transit solution and to search for ttv and/or tdv signal as indications of presence of other bodies in the system .",
    "our ccd photometric observations in _ r _ band were obtained on feb 18 2015 at the rozhen observatory .",
    "we used the 2 m rcc telescope equipped with focal reducer forero-2 and the ccd camera versarray 1300b and ( 1340 @xmath11 1300 pixels , 20 @xmath12m / pixel , diameter of field of 15 arcmin ) .",
    "the exposures were 50 s and defocusing was applied .",
    "the observations started around 1 h before the expected beginning of the transit and ended around 1 h after the event .",
    "the average photometric precision per data point was around 0.0007 mag ( the atmospheric conditions during the second half of the night were not perfect ) .",
    "the standard procedures were used for reduction of the photometric data by maximdl .",
    "we tested several sets of reduction parameters and chose the set that gave the most precise photometry for the stars of similar brightness or brighter than the target .",
    "after carefully selecting of reference stars ( table 1 , fig .",
    "1 ) we performed differential aperture photometry by maximdl .",
    "the data were cleaned of trends .    the depth of the rozhen transit ( fig .",
    "2 ) is around 11.86@xmath130.28 mmag .",
    ".coordinates and magnitudes of the target ( v ) and comparison ( c ) stars [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "we presented data of newly observed transit of hat - p-24b with a 2 m telescope .",
    "its solution gives system parameters which values are between those of the previous two solutions .",
    "the shape and depth of the new transit favor the maximum orbital inclination of 90@xmath3 .",
    "we obtained transit solutions with the same best quality for four different limb - darkening laws .",
    "the freely - varied limb - darkening coefficients for these laws turned out almost the same and their values corresponded to the stellar temperature of hat - p-24 .",
    "we found no evidences of ttv and tdv signals .",
    "hence , until now hat - p-24b has no detectable planetary companions on nearby orbits .",
    "this conclusion is in line with the result that the most hot jupiters are alone or accompanied by other planetary bodies on wide orbits .",
    "this research was supported partly by funds of the project rd-08 - 244 of shumen university .",
    "it used the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , usno - b1.0 catalogue ( http://www.nofs.navy.mil/data/fchpix/ ) , and nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service ."
