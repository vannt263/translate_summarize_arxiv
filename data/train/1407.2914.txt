    "superconductivity driven by strong electron - electron interactions has been an enigma in condensed matter physics ever since the high - temperature cuprate superconductors were discovered almost 30 years ago.@xcite common to all cuprate superconductors are square ( or rectangular ) cuo@xmath6 layers , where superconductivity is known to originate upon doping of the antiferromagnetic mott insulating phase at half filling.@xcite the superconducting state has a spin - singlet fourfold @xmath7-wave symmetry in the cuo@xmath6 planes.@xcite the spin - singlet configuration can be viewed as a direct consequence of the antiferromagnetic state in the undoped parent compounds , as the mott physics present at half filling naturally transfers into a spin - singlet symmetry for the superconducting order appearing at finite doping levels .",
    "the @xmath4-wave symmetry is a result of strong on - site repulsion , which heavily favors order parameters which average to zero over the full brillouin zone , of which the @xmath4-wave state is the simplest even - parity possibility .",
    "this is in contrast to conventional electron - phonon driven superconductors which have spin - singlet isotropic @xmath8-wave order parameters .",
    "the spin - singlet @xmath4-wave symmetry of the superconducting state is thus a direct consequence of strong electron - electron repulsion . beyond the high - temperature cuprate",
    "superconductors,@xcite many heavy fermion superconductors are likely also @xmath4-wave superconductors,@xcite as well as some organic superconductors.@xcite    all currently established @xmath4-wave superconductors have square ( or rectangular ) lattice symmetry , which naturally hosts a fourfold symmetric order parameter . the sixfold symmetric honeycomb and triangular lattices , on the other hand , offer crystal structures which do not conveniently accommodate a @xmath4-wave state . as a result",
    ", the @xmath7- and @xmath9-wave symmetries belong to the same irreducible representation for all hexagonal lattices .",
    "this means both solutions necessarily have the same transition temperature @xmath10.@xcite below @xmath10 higher order terms become important in the energy functional and the complex combination @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is very generally favored.@xcite the @xmath12 state is a chiral , time - reversal symmetry breaking state with the chirality set by the sign between the two different @xmath4-wave components@xcite and where the non - trivial topology@xcite guarantees the existence of two co - propagating , i.e. , chiral , edge states.@xcite    finding a superconductor with a honeycomb or triangular lattice and strong electron - electron interactions thus offers the exciting possibility of realizing chiral @xmath0 pairing .",
    "the honeycomb lattice further has the interesting electronic property that close to half filling the normal - state has not one single fermi surface but instead two disconnected fermi surfaces centered around the brillouin zone corners at @xmath13 and @xmath14 . superconductors with multiple fermi surfaces , such as the iron - pnictides / chalcogens ,",
    "are often known to host an intricate gap structure.@xcite thus , electron - driven superconductivity close to a mott insulating phase at half filling on the honeycomb naturally provides a very rich playground for possibly realizing exotic superconducting states . beyond superconductivity , mott physics of the honeycomb lattice has also been proposed to give rise to other exotic states such as topological mott insulator and exotic quantum spin hall states , especially in conjunction with finite spin - orbit coupling.@xcite    in terms of materials , the most prominent honeycomb material today is undoubtedly graphene.@xcite",
    "there already exist a multitude of theoretical proposals for superconductivity driven by electron - electron interactions in graphene.@xcite the fermi surface in undoped graphene only consists of two points , but doping graphene generates more free carriers , which increases the chances of superconductivity .",
    "especially the region around the van hove singularity at very heavy doping , where the fermi surface transitions to be centered around @xmath15 , has been shown to be very promising for superconductivity with @xmath0-wave symmetry , generated by even weak electron - electron interactions.@xcite while this @xmath0-wave state has been shown to be reasonably stable to disorder,@xcite experimental advancements are still needed in order to reach such high doping levels in graphene .",
    "superconductivity has also been explored in graphene at lower doping levels where the fermi surface is centered around @xmath16 , but this requires much stronger electron - electron interactions . while the on - site repulsive hubbard interaction in graphene has been approximated to be as large as half the band width,@xcite it still only puts graphene in a weak to intermediate coupling regime , where the small low - energy density of states close to half filling effectively prevents superconductivity . in order to enhance the chiral @xmath0-wave state in lightly doped graphene to the level of detectability , a proximity effect to external superconductors has been proposed.@xcite also bilayer graphene , which has a large density of states at the fermi level even in the undoped state , has been proposed to host a @xmath0-wave superconducting state upon weak doping.@xcite    looking beyond graphene , other honeycomb materials might have more potential in terms of chiral @xmath4-wave superconductivity close to half filling .",
    "one promising material is in@xmath17cu@xmath6vo@xmath18 , where singly occupied @xmath19 cu orbitals form a @xmath20 honeycomb lattice.@xcite experimentally , the undoped ground state has been identified as a likely nel antiferromagnet,@xcite with @xmath21-wave superconductivity proposed to appear upon finite doping.@xcite another material is the ( 111 ) bilayer of the perovskite sriro@xmath17,@xcite which has been found to host an antiferromagnetic heisenberg coupling on a buckled honeycomb lattice , where finite doping has the possibility to give rise to @xmath0 superconductivity.@xcite the recently discovered superconductor srptas@xcite has also been proposed to have @xmath0-wave pairing,@xcite although multiple bands around the fermi level add additional complexity to the electronic structure@xcite not present in simple one - orbital honeycomb lattice systems .",
    "another interesting materials family is the iridates a@xmath6iro@xmath17 ( a = na , li ) , where the ir atoms form a honeycomb lattice and magnetism has been shown to be captured by a heisenberg - kitaev model.@xcite hole doping this model for dominant antiferromagnetic heisenberg coupling has been shown to give spin - singlet @xmath0 pairing , whereas spin - triplet @xmath22-wave phases dominate when the kitaev coupling is increased.@xcite similar physics could potentially also be implemented using ultracold atoms , which have recently been used to produce a tunable honeycomb lattice.@xcite    theoretically , methods ranging from mean - field theory,@xcite to functional renormalization group,@xcite quantum monte carlo ( qmc),@xcite and grassman tensor - product state variational methods,@xcite have already shown that a chiral @xmath0-wave state can appear on the honeycomb lattice close to half filling in models with strong electron - electron interactions . predominantly the hubbard model with moderate on - site repulsion,@xcite and especially the @xmath1-@xmath2 model,@xcite which is the resulting model in the limit of very strong hubbard on - site repulsion,@xcite have been used .",
    "for example , renormalized mean - field theory ( rmft)@xcite and a slave - boson@xcite approach have recently been used to handle the no - double occupancy criterion in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model.@xcite the chiral @xmath0-wave state was shown to emerge quite generally upon doping , in agreement with earlier mean - field studies not incorporating the no - double occupancy criterion.@xcite further , it has also been suggested that the disjoint fermi surfaces might give rise to a state with @xmath0 symmetry in one valley but @xmath5 symmetry in the other valley.@xcite in this _ mixed chirality state _ the chirality cancels out leaving the system time - reversal symmetry invariant and with no edge states , but still with a highly unconventional order parameter .    in this work",
    "our goal is to study the competition between single versus the mixed and other zero net sum chirality @xmath4-wave superconductivity on the honeycomb lattice when doping the mott state at half filling . to accomplish this we first of all",
    "provide a general symmetry analysis of the allowed superconducting symmetries on the honeycomb lattice resulting from strong electron - electron interactions , especially focusing on the nodal structure close to half filling .",
    "since the normal - state fermi surface is disjoint and centered around @xmath16 close to half filling , its nodal structure can be notably different from that of a single fermi surface centered around the zone center @xmath15 .",
    "we then specialize and study superconductivity from strong on - site repulsion .",
    "more specifically , we use rmft to study the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and qmc calculations to treat the original hubbard-@xmath3 model . the rmft results are specifically focused on the quasiparticle energy spectrum and provide evidence that the mixed chirality state is not more energetically favorable than the single chirality state .",
    "our qmc study complements earlier qmc work in the intermediate-@xmath3 regime,@xcite as it spans a whole range of @xmath3 values also approaching the strong-@xmath3 limit , and shows that the @xmath0 state gets more favorable at higher on - site @xmath3 values , which corroborates the use of rmft . using rmft",
    "we then provide a detailed analysis of the proposed mixed chirality state.@xcite by using the general symmetry analysis we conclude that the mixed chirality state can not be a physically viable superconducting state of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , or other models with spin - singlet superconductivity , without reducing translational symmetry . moreover , even with reduced translational symmetry the dirac points are either still disjoint , in which case they can not still harbor the mixed chirality state , or they are degenerate at the zone center , where valley hybridization prevents different superconducting condensates . following this result",
    "we also study real - space modulations in four- , six- , and eight - site unit cells .",
    "these extended unit cells allow the order parameter phase winding ( or flux ) to be zero or alternating on neighboring honeycomb plaquettes , which can result in a zero net sum chirality in the material .",
    "the six - site cell also allows for a kekul distortion which has no identifiable plaquette flux.@xcite in all cases we find that the single chirality @xmath0 state is energetically favorable . by extrapolating these results",
    "we draw the conclusion that real - space modulations of the chiral @xmath4-wave state , which generate a net zero sum chirality state , do not lead to a lower energy .",
    "we can thus conclude that the single chirality @xmath4-wave state is very likely the most stable state on the honeycomb lattice for superconductivity close to the mott phase at half filling .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "symmetry ] we provide a general symmetry analysis for zero - momentum pairing on the honeycomb lattice , as appropriate for pairing originating from strong electron - electron interactions . in section [ sec : tj ] we study the @xmath1-@xmath2 model within rmft , paying special attention to the quasiparticle energy , and in section [ sec : qmc ] we provide a qmc study of the hubbard model which corroborates the rmft findings . then in section [ sec : extcells ] we use a symmetry analysis to show that a mixed chirality state is not feasible without breaking translation symmetry . we also study extended unit cells and conclude that no real - space modulation leads to a mixed or net zero sum chirality state being the favored state in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we provide a concluding discussion and summary .",
    "we start with a general symmetry analysis of the superconducting state close to half filling on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the superconducting state always breaks the global u(1 ) symmetry , but can also break additional symmetries present in the normal state hamiltonian , such as crystal , spin - rotation symmetries but also time - reversal symmetry . the term  unconventional superconductivity \" is often used to classify states with such additionally broken symmetries . even without detailed knowledge of the attractive interaction causing superconductivity it is possible to do a general symmetry analysis of the possible superconducting states for a specific material .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quadratic bcs hamiltonian describing the superconducting state in momentum space results in a linear eigenvalue equation for the superconducting order parameter @xmath23 around the transition temperature @xmath10 .",
    "we can therefore expand the momentum space dependence of @xmath23 with respect to a set of basis functions , which can be classified according to the irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the normal - state hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] for a more detailed treatment ) . apart from accidental degeneracies , the superconducting state will belong to a single irreducible representation at @xmath10 and it is only possible to have a mixture of symmetries belonging to different irreducible representation if multiple superconducting transitions take place as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice belongs to the hexagonal group @xmath24 with @xmath25 , which restricts the irreducible representations to those even under in - plane reflection .",
    "we will here limit ourselves to zero - momentum pairing , which pairs electrons symmetrically across the @xmath15 point in the brillouin zone , and then @xmath24 is the relevant symmetry group for all doping levels of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the pairing from strong electron - electron interactions is very short range in real space and thus extended in @xmath26-space , which naturally results in zero - momentum pairing close to half filling on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we will also for the moment only consider a single band , but as we shall see in section [ sec : tj ] , extensions to multiple bands can be straightforward .",
    "furthermore , we restrict the treatment to spin - singlet and @xmath27 spin - triplet solutions in spin - space , since all unitary @xmath28 states can be constructed by spin - rotation of the @xmath27 spin - triplet solution .",
    "table [ tab : sym ] shows the simplest possible basis functions satisfying the symmetry requirements of the irreducible representations of the @xmath24 group for the 2d honeycomb lattice .",
    "higher order expansions are of course possible but give order parameters with more zero - energy nodes .",
    "since the quasiparticle energy is @xmath29 for a single band with normal - state dispersion @xmath30 and a unitary superconducting order parameter @xmath31 , states with lower number of nodes are usually energetically favored .",
    ".available irreducible representations ( irreps . ) for the honeycomb lattice ( @xmath24 crystal group with @xmath25 ) with their simplest basis functions and symmetries in the hexagonal brillouin zone ( thick black lines ) .",
    "green circles indicate the fermi surface close to half filling , which is disconnected and centered around @xmath13 and @xmath32 . for filling beyond the van hove singularity at @xmath33 doping the fermi surface is instead centered around the zone center at @xmath15 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the basis functions should be understood as representatives of the transformation behavior but they might not obey the translation symmetry of the particular lattice . taking also the latter into account results in the last column in table [ tab : sym ] , which schematically shows the simplest ( in the sense of lowest number of nodes around @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) symmetries for each irreducible representation .",
    "as seen , some of the basis functions with two- and fourfold rotational symmetry needs to be slightly modified in order to also obey translational symmetry in reciprocal space .",
    "since the superconducting order parameter is necessarily fermionic in nature , even - parity ( @xmath34 ) representations correspond to spin - singlet states , whereas spin - triplet pairing gives odd - parity ( @xmath35 ) spatial dependence for a single band .",
    "a superconducting state belonging to the identity representation @xmath36 has all the symmetries of the normal - state hamiltonian .",
    "this is possible either for a constant order parameter , or if it has the same @xmath26-dependence as the normal - state hamiltonian .",
    "the former is the conventional @xmath8-wave superconducting state , typically present for phonon - driven superconductors , whereas the latter is an extended @xmath8-wave state .",
    "the extended @xmath8-wave state has an effective @xmath38 dependence around each dirac point and has been suggested as a possible state for nearest - neighbor attraction.@xcite it is also usually present as a less favorable solution for interactions which favor a higher angular momentum spin - singlet pairing , as is the case of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model close to half filling.@xcite the @xmath8-wave symmetries give a fully gapped superconducting state , with the exception of exactly at half filling for the extended @xmath8-wave solution .",
    "the other spin - singlet one - dimensional ( 1d ) representation is @xmath37 has six nodal lines crossing in the zone center .",
    "even though the number of nodal lines are reduced to three around @xmath16 , the high number of nodes makes this state highly unlikely in a real material .      due to the incompatibility of the sixfold symmetry of the honeycomb lattice with the fourfold symmetric @xmath4-wave solutions , they belong to a 2d irreducible representation , @xmath39",
    "this means that the two @xmath4-wave solutions , or any linear combination of them , are necessarily degenerate at @xmath10 . below @xmath10 ,",
    "higher order corrections become important , and the chiral @xmath40-wave symmetries have been shown to be favored quite generally.@xcite this follows from a very general ginzburg - landau argument where a @xmath41 phase shift between two separate order parameters usually lowers the total energy , see , e.g. ,  ref .",
    "[ ] . due to the intrinsically complex order parameter",
    ", these chiral states also break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "while the @xmath4-wave solutions have two nodal lines crossing a normal - state fermi surface centered around @xmath15 , only one nodal line crosses small fermi surfaces centered around @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath7-wave state thus has effectively @xmath42-wave symmetry locally around the @xmath16 points , whereas the @xmath9-wave state has local @xmath43 symmetry.@xcite note that this is still compatible with spin - singlet pairing since the order parameter is even over the full brillouin zone . while the individual @xmath4-wave solutions will always be nodal superconductors , the chiral @xmath12-wave combinations are fully gapped , apart from the pathological situation when the normal - state fermi surface only consists of points at @xmath16 or @xmath15",
    "this by itself in fact provides a simple energy argument for why the chiral @xmath40 combinations are preferred .",
    "the chiral @xmath4-wave superconducting state close to half filling has been shown to be the favored state for both the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and the hubbard-@xmath3 model for strong interactions.@xcite moreover , a @xmath0-wave state has also been shown to be the preferred symmetry in the weak - coupling limit of the hubbard model when the normal - state fermi surface is centered around @xmath15 @xcite and also close to the van hove singularity.@xcite      the allowed 1d spin - triplet order parameters belong to the @xmath46 irreducible representations .",
    "both of these have three nodal lines intersecting at @xmath15 and are thus both spin - triplet @xmath47-wave states with very similar properties when the normal - state fermi surface is centered around @xmath15 .",
    "however , their nodal lines are rotated @xmath48 relative to each other , such that the @xmath44 has nodal lines also through @xmath16 , but @xmath45 does not .",
    "this makes for distinctly different behavior close to half filling .",
    "while the @xmath44 symmetry still has @xmath47-wave symmetry around @xmath49 , the @xmath45 symmetry gives a fully gapped state with an effective @xmath50-wave symmetry ; i.e. , the gap is ( largely ) constant on each fermi surface but with different signs .",
    "note that the @xmath50 state is necessarily a spin - triplet state on the honeycomb lattice since the two fermi surfaces are located at opposite momenta .",
    "this spin - triplet @xmath51-wave state has been found to be the ground state for the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice close to half filling in the limit of weak interactions.@xcite it has also been shown to be favored in superconductors with generally disconnected , reasonably well - nested , fermi surfaces driven by a spin - fluctuation exchange mechanism.@xcite      the spin - triplet 2d representation @xmath52 consists of the @xmath43- , and @xmath42-wave symmetries , which both have one nodal line across the brillouin zone . even after adapting these symmetries to the honeycomb lattice , it is possible to only have one nodal line around @xmath16 .",
    "these states are thus essentially equivalent to the spin - singlet @xmath4-wave solutions close to half filling , apart from having different spin quantum numbers . similarly to the spin - singlet @xmath0-wave solution , the @xmath38 ( @xmath22 ) combination should have the lowest energy below @xmath10 and is also a fully gapped state .",
    "the @xmath52 solution appears , for example , as the ground state for models with pairing on nearest - neighbor bonds which is odd in @xmath26 .",
    "such spatial odd - parity occurs for spin - triplet bond pairing , but can also be a spin - singlet state if there is an additional quantum number under which the order parameter is odd .",
    "a prototype example of the latter is band index , with spin - singlet , @xmath22-wave odd - interband pairing found in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model,@xcite as briefly discussed in section [ sec : tj ] .",
    "allowing also for @xmath28 pairing , the spin - triplet @xmath53-wave states found in the heisenberg - kitaev model with dominant kitaev coupling belong to this irreducible representation.@xcite    to summarize the results of table [ tab : sym ] , the honeycomb lattice allows for superconducting order parameters that have many different number of nodes in the brillouin zone but for disjoint normal - state fermi surfaces at @xmath16 the number of nodes present in the superconducting state is often reduced .",
    "most interestingly , there exist several different fully gapped states close to half filling , even for order parameters that change signs in the brillouin zone such that they average to zero .",
    "this is especially important for superconductivity driven by strong electron - electron interactions , which want to avoid on - site pairing .",
    "these states include the spin - singlet @xmath40 states belonging to the @xmath39 irreducible representation and the spin - triplet @xmath47-wave state belonging to the @xmath45 representation .",
    "both of these states have been shown to appear in models of electron - driven superconductivity on the honeycomb lattice close to half filling : the @xmath0-wave state in models involving strong interactions which favor a spin - singlet configuration @xcite and the @xmath47-wave state for weak interactions where a spin - triplet state is allowed.@xcite also the spin - triplet @xmath53-wave states in the @xmath52 irreducible representation can be fully gapped and have been shown to appear in the heisenberg - kitaev model appropriate for some iridate compounds.@xcite",
    "having reviewed the possible order parameter symmetries on the honeycomb lattice in the last section , we now turn to using explicit models for capturing the effect of strong interactions in honeycomb lattice materials , such as in@xmath17cu@xmath6vo@xmath18 , and determining the favorable superconducting symmetries",

    "we also see how the initially fourfold symmetric @xmath4-wave solutions adapt to the sixfold honeycomb lattice by giving the @xmath0 solution ( finite ) quasiparticle energy minima at three points around each fermi surface , thus naturally incorporating the lattice symmetry .    before closing this section we briefly also comment on the effect of further - neighbor coupling .",
    "expanding the hubbard hamiltonian up to fourth - order processes generates a coupling @xmath103 acting on next - nearest neighbors.@xcite introducing a small such term , as relevant for , e.g. , in@xmath17cu@xmath6vo@xmath18,@xcite preserves the antiferromagnetic order at half filling@xcite and has been shown to further enhance the @xmath0 solution over the extended @xmath8-wave state close to half filling.@xcite",
    "the above rmft results shows that for strong on - site electron repulsion , approximated by the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , the @xmath0-wave superconducting state is favored for doping levels ranging from half filling to beyond the van hove singularity .",
    "here we present qmc results of the original hubbard-@xmath3 model , which provides additional evidence of the preference for chiral @xmath0-wave superconductivity in this full doping regime . since these are the results of true many - body calculations they are highly complementary to the rmft solution , which relies on first performing a perturbative expansion in @xmath104 and then using mean - field theory .",
    "more specifically , we perform determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc)@xcite calculations on a 24-site cluster for several different values of the hubbard-@xmath3 term ( here we set @xmath105 for simplicity ) for a range of filling fractions @xmath106 . we calculate the pairing susceptibilities in the various channels via @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the number of cluster sites and @xmath109 denotes the renormalization factor of the pairing form factors : @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath111 represent the form factor associated with pairing on bond @xmath112 in real space , subject to the different irreducible representations of the @xmath24 point group , enumerated by index @xmath113 .",
    "for the spin - singlet and spin - triplet pairing amplitudes we have the following pairing possibilities : @xmath114    in order to extract useful information of the many - body effects on the pairing in the case of small cluster calculations it is usually more appropriate to investigate the connected pairing susceptibility @xmath115 rather than the @xmath71 itself.@xcite this is due to the fact that @xmath116 is the purely disconnected counterpart of @xmath71 (  bubble contribution  ) and it contains the hubbard-@xmath3 effect on a single - particle level .",
    "thus we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmc ] both @xmath71 ( solid lines ) and @xmath116 ( dashed lines ) as functions of filling @xmath106 , of which the relative magnitude reflects whether pairing is promoted ( @xmath117 ) or suppressed ( @xmath118 ) by correlation effects .",
    "we here include all pairing symmetries with one or fewer nodal lines close to the brillouin zone corners at @xmath16 .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmc ] that for small @xmath119 , the difference @xmath115 is always close to zero , regardless of pairing symmetry and filling @xmath106 .",
    "this suggests that the vertex corrections do not allow pair formation at small @xmath3 values . at larger @xmath120",
    "we start seeing clear positive @xmath115 differences for several symmetries , indicating that the pairing with these particular symmetries is enhanced . although the @xmath45 , @xmath121 , and @xmath36 symmetries all show some positive difference @xmath115 at certain filling fractions @xmath106 for these larger @xmath3 values , we find that @xmath7 ( and @xmath9 ) always has the largest difference @xmath115 for filling fractions between half filling and the van hove singularity .",
    "this shows that it is the most dominant pairing on honeycomb lattice close to half filling .",
    "note that the band width is @xmath122 , so these qmc results do not only confirm the results of the rmft calculations for the strong-@xmath3 limit , but also show that the chiral @xmath0-wave state is the dominant superconducting instability even in the intermediate - coupling regime .",
    "the chiral @xmath4-wave state found to be the ground state in both the rmft and qmc calculations above has a twofold ground - state degeneracy , @xmath0 or @xmath5 , at all temperatures below @xmath10 .",
    "the two states have different chiralities , which can be classified by a chern number or a skyrmion winding number,@xcite which takes values @xmath123 for the two different chiralities .",
    "the most notable consequence of the finite topological number is that it guarantees the existence of two chiral edge states crossing the bulk energy gap.@xcite beyond the different chiralities , the two @xmath4-wave states are otherwise identical ; for example they have the exactly same quasiparticle spectrum , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqp ] ) .",
    "most notably , both chiral @xmath4-wave states break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "however , the disconnected fermi surfaces on the nearly half - filled honeycomb lattice has been proposed to favor @xmath0-wave symmetry in the @xmath13 valley but @xmath5-wave symmetry in the @xmath32 valley.@xcite this _ mixed chirality _ state does not break global time - reversal symmetry and has canceling edge states .",
    "in fact , if one plots the gap order parameters in the original atomic basis , the @xmath0 state is gapped at @xmath13 but gapless at @xmath32 , whereas the @xmath5 state is gapped at @xmath32 but gapless at @xmath13.@xcite thus a simple energy argument seemingly should favor the mixed chirality state .",
    "however , in the atomic basis we can not draw the normal - state fermi surface , and it is thus not clear what a gapped or gapless order parameter means for the quasiparticle energy , which is the important quantity . as a matter of fact , from the quasiparticle energy spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqp ] ) , we know that the @xmath12 solutions have the same quasiparticle excitations in both valleys and thus the same gap structure on normal - state fermi surfaces centered around @xmath13 and @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the mixed chirality state can not be argued to appear in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model from a simple energy argument .    in the case of strong on - site",
    "repulsion and its associated @xmath1-@xmath2 model , the mixed chirality state is also problematic from a more fundamental physical point of view .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2 model has very short range real - space pairing ( on nearest - neighbor bonds ) , which corresponds to extended pairing in @xmath26-space . for the honeycomb lattice close to half filling",
    "this dictates that the two electrons forming a cooper pair belong to different fermi surfaces and they form a zero - momentum paired state , i.e.  the two electrons have momenta @xmath26 and @xmath124 , respectively . for zero - momentum pairing",
    "it is the symmetry of the order parameter over the _",
    "brillouin zone that is important , as discussed in section  [ sec : symmetry ] . for the mixed chirality state , with @xmath0 at @xmath13 and @xmath5 at @xmath125 ,",
    "the @xmath4-wave part has even parity over the full brillouin zone , whereas the @xmath126-wave part has odd parity .",
    "however , a superconducting order parameter needs to be fermionic in nature , which means that even spatial parity leads to a spin - singlet state ( for intraband pairing ) , while odd parity gives a spin - triplet state .",
    "thus the mixed chirality state is necessarily a mixture of @xmath4-wave spin - singlet and @xmath126 spin - triplet parts .",
    "this is not compatible with the superconducting state in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model which always have a spin - singlet nature , as clearly seen in e.g.  eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmf ] ) . moreover , if one still writes a mixed chirality solution and then tries to do an inverse fourier transform back to real space in order to determine the bond pairing correlations , only the @xmath4 part survives , whereas the @xmath126 part results in zero contributions in all directions of the nearest - neighbor bonds . based on this",
    "we conclude that the mixed chirality solution , with different chiralities in different valleys located at opposite momenta , is not a physically viable solution for models with zero - momentum spin - singlet pairing on the honeycomb lattice , which is the case in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "it is perhaps in principle possible to get a mixed chirality phase for more complex models , for example with spin - orbit coupling or long - range interactions , but we here focus on the strong short - range electron - electron interaction limit of the simplest single - orbital spin - degenerate honeycomb lattice .",
    "the negative result above for the mixed chirality state begs the question of whether there is any other way to effectively cancel the chirality for the chiral @xmath4-wave superconducting state in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model ?",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2 model dictates nearest - neighbor bond pairing , which results in a zero - momentum paired state , with a spin - singlet spin structure .",
    "the only freedom left in the pure superconducting phase is the possibility of breaking translation symmetry by extending the real - space unit cell . in reciprocal space",
    "such real - space modulations lead to a reduction of the size of the first brillouin zone .",
    "this could potentially help forming a state with mixed chirality or otherwise a zero net sum chirality , as it is the spatial symmetry consideration over the full brillouin zone which is the underlying problem above .",
    "thus , what we are looking for is a spin - singlet state with local chiral @xmath4-wave bond solution character , i.e. , @xmath127 on each three nearest - neighbor bonds , but where we allow the unit cell to be larger than the original two - site cell , such that the same phase winding of the @xmath4-wave pattern is not repeated every two sites .",
    "this represents a mixing of chiralities in real space .",
    "note that all these states are automatically orthogonal to the extended @xmath8-wave state . in order to guide a search for a viable such state on larger unit cells we first study the @xmath0-wave in the original two - site unit cell in fig .",
    "[ fig : cells](a ) . for simplicity",
    "we fix the overall complex phase of the superconducting state such that the horizontal bond has a vanishing phase .",
    "we see that the order parameter phase winds twice around each plaquette ( red plaquette arrow ) creating a finite plaquette flux . around each site",
    "the order parameter winds once , but it adds up to a @xmath128 winding since both sites have the same winding direction .",
    "this is fully consistent with the winding number @xmath129 for the chiral @xmath0 state .      to find possible candidates for a state where the overall chirality is canceled in the unit cell",
    ", we start by studying the simplest expanded unit cell which contain four sites . without loss of generality",
    "we again fix the phase on the leftmost horizontal bond to zero , and then assume a counterclockwise winding around the leftmost site . assuming we can only put the phases @xmath130 , @xmath131 , or @xmath132 on each bond , we immediately arrive at the phase pattern in fig .  [",
    "fig : cells](b ) if we avoid repeating the two - site unit cell . here",
    "the total site winding cancels over the four sites .",
    "the plaquette winding is also zero on each plaquette .",
    "this is thus a state where the overall chirality is zero .",
    "this state can be understood in terms of a system with vertical ferromagnetic order but antiferromagnetic horizontal order .",
    "thus to recover the original state time - reversal and translation by one original two - site unit cell is needed in the horizontal direction .",
    "we study this four - site unit cell using effective values @xmath133 and @xmath134 , where we include the statistical weighting factors in the values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we also include @xmath71 into the effective value of @xmath133 , as it only renormalizes the band structure .",
    "these simplifications lead to the mean - field hamiltonian : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is now the order parameter on bond @xmath112 in the @xmath57th two - site cell .",
    "for example , for the four - site unit cell , we have different @xmath137 for @xmath57 and @xmath138 , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : cells](b ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmftilde ] ) allows for a straightforward solution with no formal constraint on the site occupancy , while still qualitatively capturing the relevant physics .    for a four - site real - space modulation",
    "the brillouin zone in reciprocal space is half as big as the original brillouin zone .",
    "this leads to the dirac points , originally at the corners of the brillouin zone at @xmath139 and @xmath125 ( @xmath140 is the length of the lattice unit vectors ) now being `` folded '' into @xmath141 and @xmath142 . performing a fourier transform of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmftilde ] ) to this reduced brillouin zone we can write down the hamiltonian in @xmath26-space and then solve self - consistently for the size @xmath143 of the order parameter . in order to find the most favorable state we compare their total free energy at zero @xmath144 :",
    "@xmath145 where @xmath146 are the quasiparticle energies of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmftilde ] ) and @xmath108 is the total number of lattice sites . more specifically , at filling fractions such that the normal - state fermi surfaces are well - centered around the dirac points , we compare the free energy of this four - site solution to that of the original two - site chiral @xmath0-wave solution and also to that of the normal state .",
    "we find that the free energy of the four - site zero net flux solution is _ higher _ than both the free energy of the original one - cell solution and the normal state .",
    "thus the solution depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cells](b ) is not a physically viable superconducting state .",
    "the result from the four - site unit cell shows that zero plaquette flux is not a stable configuration .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that it is not possible to have opposite @xmath128 windings on neighboring plaquettes . to achieve different plaquette windings",
    "it is necessary to insert plaquettes with zero winding in - between .",
    "the smallest structure with plaquettes with opposite fluxes is therefore an eight - site unit cell , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cells](c ) .",
    "here the overall plaquette flux is zero since the overall winding cancels on the four plaquettes in the unit cell , even though some individual plaquettes now have finite fluxes . the total site phase winding also averages to zero .",
    "the brillouin zone for this eight - site real - space modulation is half that of the four - site unit cell .",
    "the dirac points are still at @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "we again use the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmftilde ] ) , consider only systems with fermi surfaces highly centered around the dirac points , solve self - consistently for the order parameter , and compare the free energy of this eight - site state to that of the original two - site chiral @xmath0-wave state and the normal state .",
    "we find that the free energy of eight - site solution is _ higher _ than both the free energy of the original one - cell solution and the normal state , which means that this is not a preferred state .",
    "in fact , the structure in fig .  [",
    "fig : cells](c ) can be seen as two - site thick domains with different chiralities , with the zero flux two - site structures in - between forming minimum width domain walls between the two different chiral states .",
    "it is thus not surprising that this structure has a higher energy than solutions without any domain walls .",
    "this line of argument also extends to the four - site unit cell , which can be seen as only containing domain walls . based on these results",
    "we conclude that even larger unit cells with alternating plaquette fluxes and/or zero - flux plaquettes will not provide a superconducting state with lower energy than the original , single chirality state .",
    "the above results for the four- and eight - site unit cells shows that plaquettes with net zero flux are not energetically favorable and that they in fact can be viewed as domain walls .",
    "these unit cells represent the simplest real - space modulations of the chiral @xmath0 state with the restriction that the phases on the horizontal bonds ( or along another nearest - neighbor bond direction ) are zero .",
    "this latter restriction is incidentally the same as in the ( unphysical ) mixed chirality @xmath12 solution since the part that changes across the two different fermi surfaces , i.e. , @xmath126 , has a zero component on that bond .",
    "here we finally relax also this restriction .",
    "the simplest real - space modulation with different phases on the horizontal bonds is a six - site unit cell , since the four - site unit cell requires the phase on the two horizontal bonds to be equal .",
    "the six - site unit cell allows for the so - called kekul distortion , which is a rather well - known distortion for the honeycomb lattice .",
    "it has recently been shown that it is possible to find two real - valued fully gapped spin - triplet kekul superconducting states if one starts with a sufficient strong attractive nearest - neighbor interaction and that these states can be energetically favorable.@xcite the two states investigated had a @xmath7 and @xmath9 kekul modulation .",
    "we arrive at the same kekul real - space variation but for a spin - singlet order parameter as required by the @xmath1-@xmath2 model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cells](d ) we show the complex chiral @xmath4-wave kekul modulation .",
    "there is for the kekul chiral @xmath4-wave structure no well defined winding per plaquette but the site phase winding averages out to zero .",
    "thus this is a state which again presents a possibility of overall cancellation of the chirality .    in order to perform a straightforward study of the kekul pattern we again use the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmftilde ] ) . at half filling in the original two - site unit cell an interaction strength of @xmath147 is needed in order to reach the superconducting state . also ,",
    "at half filling the extended @xmath8- and the @xmath4-wave solutions are degenerate in the original two - site unit cell.@xcite it is only by doping away from half filling that the @xmath4-wave solutions are energetically favored ( since @xmath102 prevents superconductivity at half filling there is no problem with the statement that @xmath4-wave is always the favored symmetry in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model ) . performing the exact same calculation to find the quantum critical point for the two different real valued kekul @xmath4-wave patterns , we find that both of these @xmath4-wave solutions require @xmath148 .",
    "thus , both spin - singlet kekul @xmath4-wave patterns are notably less favorable than the extended @xmath8-wave solution at zero and low doping levels .",
    "since the kekule chiral @xmath4-wave solution is only a complex combination of these two solutions with the same node at the dirac points , it has the same quantum critical point at @xmath149 .",
    "we therefore conclude that close to half filling any kekul ' e spin - singlet @xmath4-wave structure is less favorable than the extended @xmath8-wave solution , and again this is not a competitive candidate for a zero - chirality @xmath4-wave state .",
    "this result can be understood by considering that the kekul distortion folds both the @xmath13 and @xmath32 points onto the zone center at @xmath15 . at @xmath15",
    "the @xmath150-wave solutions are both gapless and only the extended @xmath8-wave solution is gapped , which should favor the @xmath8-wave solution . note that this is different from the situation at the @xmath16 points where both the extended @xmath8-wave and the chiral @xmath0 states are gapless .",
    "therefore , there is in the original two - site unit cell no such simple energy argument as to favor one solution over the other .",
    "instead , the @xmath4-wave solutions ultimately wins in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model in the original two - site cell since they are orthogonal to on - site pairing which is disfavored in systems with strong electron - electron repulsion .      to conclude the search for a mixed or zero net sum chirality state we note that , while an arbitrary large extended unit cell leads to a reduced brillouin zone , the dirac cones are still folded onto opposite momenta , @xmath151 and @xmath152 . as long as this momentum is non zero , a solution with different chiralities in different valleys necessarily has the @xmath126 part in a spin - triplet configuration , which is prohibited in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , or any other model with spin - singlet superconductivity .",
    "both the four- and eight - site solutions discussed above also show that real - space realizations producing allowed zero net sum chirality states do not produce a favorable superconducting state for @xmath151 non zero . only if both dirac cones are folded onto the zone center at @xmath15",
    "does the spin - triplet requirement of the @xmath126 part go away .",
    "however , in this case , the two dirac cones become fully overlapping and they then likely hybridize , preventing different phases on the two fermi surfaces .",
    "the kekul distortion discussed above is one zero net sum chirality example with @xmath153 where hybridization causes a mass gap to open in the dirac spectrum.@xcite while the kekul spin - singlet chiral @xmath4-wave real - space modulation is physically feasible , it is energetically unfavorable compared to the single chirality @xmath4-wave state .",
    "the honeycomb lattice close to half filling offers unique opportunities to host exotic superconducting states driven by electron - electron interactions . due to the sixfold lattice symmetry and disjoint fermi surfaces at @xmath16 several possible order parameters",
    "produce a fully gapped quasiparticle spectrum even though they contain nodal lines in the brillouin zone , as displayed in table  [ tab : sym ] .",
    "this includes one of the possible spin - triplet @xmath47-wave states , which has a fully gapped @xmath50-wave symmetry close to @xmath16 and has been found to be the favored state for the hubbard model in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "@xcite in the limit of strong on - site pairing , as described by the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , the pairing instead has a spin - singlet configuration due to the antiferromagnetic mott state in the undoped limit .",
    "the sixfold lattice symmetry then gives rise to the time - reversal breaking chiral @xmath0-wave state , which is also a fully gapped state.@xcite we have here provided qmc results showing that the chiral @xmath0-wave is the favored superconducting symmetry over a wide range of @xmath3 values spanning the intermediate to strong coupling regimes . only at very large doping levels beyond the van hove point",
    "is an extended @xmath8-wave scenario plausible .",
    "@xcite    most importantly , by investigating the quasiparticle energy spectrum and the symmetry aspects of the chiral @xmath4-wave state , we have also studied the feasibility to find a recently proposed mixed chirality @xmath4-wave state,@xcite where the pairing is @xmath0 in one valley and @xmath5 in the other valley .",
    "however , due to zero - momentum pairing and a spin - singlet configuration in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , we find that a mixed chirality state is not possible to achieve without reducing the translational symmetry . to extend the search for a mixed or other zero net sum chirality states we investigated extended unit cells with an overall zero phase winding ( flux ) of the complex @xmath4-wave order parameter .",
    "extended cells with alternating or zero plaquette fluxes can be seen as different domain and domain walls configurations , respectively , and we find that such states are not energetically favorable .",
    "we also find that the kekul chiral @xmath4-wave distortion , which produces a state with no definable plaquette flux , do not give a superconducting state with lower energy than the single chirality @xmath4-wave state .",
    "we thus find no favored mixed or otherwise zero net sum chirality states using simple real - space modulations .",
    "moreover , any real - space modulation with the two dirac points at non zero @xmath154 can not produce a mixed chirality state due to the spin - singlet constraint on the order parameter .",
    "only when @xmath153 is this restriction lifted but then any valley hybridization leads to the same phase of the order parameters in the two valleys .",
    "therefore we conclude that the single chirality @xmath0-wave state is likely the most stable state even in the presence of disjoint fermi surfaces on the lightly doped honeycomb lattice in the limit of strong electron - electron interactions as described within the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
