    "during the past year , a suite of new near  infrared ( nir ) surveys has extended the search for star  forming galaxies to redshift @xmath16 using the well  proven lyman ",
    "break technique ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "with respect to lower redshift , the number density of uv  selected galaxies decreases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their uv continuum becomes bluer implying either reduced dust obscuration or poorer metal enrichment or both ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their stellar masses are , on average , smaller than those of their lower redshift counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , these results are based on color - selected samples with no spectroscopic validation . at the time of writing , spectroscopic detections of only a few individual objects",
    "have been obtained at @xmath17 @xcite .    the lack of knowledge of the true redshifts of the current @xmath18 candidates places significant limitations on our ability to robustly measure the properties of the galaxies at this critical cosmic epoch .",
    "for example , the fraction of interlopers and the redshift distribution of the sample galaxies are necessary to robustly measure the uv luminosity function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "currently , the former remains unknown , and the latter is estimated with monte carlo simulations under various assumptions for the intrinsic distributions of uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , surface brightness and morphology , with the result that the measure of the luminosity function remains subject to uncontrolled systematic errors .    in practice ,",
    "given the marked decrease in sensitivity of current spectroscopic observations at increasing redshift , the spectral confirmation of galaxies at @xmath19 relies heavily on their ly@xmath6   emission line , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* s10 and v09 in the following ) .",
    "indeed , redshifts derived without ly@xmath6  typically have lower confidence , although their number may be comparable ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d10 in the following ) .",
    "the line in itself is an important diagnostic of physical processes at work in the galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since its strength and velocity profile depend on the instantaneous star - formation rate , dust content , metallicity , kinematics and geometry of the interstellar medium .",
    "particularly relevant here is the evidence that the fraction of ly@xmath6  emitters in uv  selected samples increases with redshift ( v09,s10 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* s07 in the following ) and that the fraction of galaxies with a large ly@xmath6  equivalent width ( ew ) is substantially larger at fainter uv luminosities .",
    "finally , the very visibility of the ly@xmath6  line during the ending phases of the cosmic re  ionization is subject to the damping effect of an increasing neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , expected to attenuate most of its luminosity and make the earliest galaxies consequently more difficult to identify . hence , the line profile and the evolution of its ew are sensitive diagnostics of the ionization state of the high redshift igm .    to address these issues we have started a campaign of spectroscopic follow - up of @xmath20 `` z  dropout '' candidates , selected from high  quality imaging surveys obtained with vlt / hawk - i and _ hst_/wfc3 . in this paper",
    "we present the first results from a sample selected in the goods  s field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* c10 in the following ) .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system , and we adopt @xmath21  km / s / mpc , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this initial spectroscopic sample includes relatively bright lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) candidates at @xmath0 ( listed in table [ targets ] ) , five from the hawk ",
    "i images ( 4 from c10 and 1 from @xcite ) and two from wfc3 @xcite , spanning the magnitude range @xmath24 .",
    "we filled empty slitlets in the multi - object slit masks with other candidates of lower quality and/or at lower redshift , including a candidate brown dwarf ( @xcite , c10 ) and @xmath25dropouts from the goods survey not observed by v09 .",
    "observations were taken in service mode with the fors2 spectrograph on the eso very large telescope , between 12 november 2009 and 14 january 2010 .",
    "we used the 600z holographic grating , that provides the highest sensitivity in the range @xmath26   with a spectral resolution @xmath27 and a sampling of 1.6   per pixel for a 1  slit .",
    "the data presented here come from the coaddition of 75 spectra of 842 seconds of integration each , on a single mask , for a grand total of 63150 s ( 17.5 hr ) , with median seeing around 0.8  .",
    "each slitlet was 1  wide and 14  long , to maximize the number of slits available while allowing a careful sky subtraction .",
    "all our high priority targets were placed at the center of the slits , and spectra were taken in series of three different positions , offset by @xmath28 in the direction perpendicular to the dispersion .",
    "since our objects are extremely faint , the slit centering was based on the astrometry solution obtained from the hawk ",
    "i images , which is which is well aligned to the acs one .",
    "we have directly verified this by placing a few bright objects from the acs catalogs in small slits , and ensuring that they were correctly aligned during the observations .",
    "it is also reassuring to note that three faint @xmath25-dropouts selected from the acs catalog which were placed in slitlets using the same astrometry , have a clear ly@xmath6  detection at @xmath29 ( full details will be given in a future paper ) .",
    "data reduction was performed using an optimized version of the recipes adopted in v09 and previous papers .",
    "after standard flat - fielding and wavelength calibration , we subtracted the sky emission lines with two different procedures . in the first case ( polyn in the following ) we fit polynomials of order @xmath30 ( from 1 to 5 ) to the sky intensity at each pixel position .",
    "this procedure in principle ensures the highest s / n , but is sensitive to systematics induced by defects in the detector or in the slit manufacturing",
    ". a safer but somewhat noisier approach ( abba in the following ) is to subtract the sky background between two consecutive exposures , exploiting the fact that the target spectrum is offset due to dithering .",
    "we found the spectra obtained with the two techniques entirely consistent . finally , spectra were flux - calibrated using the observations of spectrophotometric standards .",
    "slit losses are small , given the extremely compact size of the targets and we neglect them in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the r.m.s .  of the resulting spectra ,",
    "which will be used later to determine the probability of our results with a monte carlo simulation , has been estimated `` by first principles '' , i.e. , computing the absolute r.m.s .  of each frame from its raw counts",
    "@xmath31 as @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the @xmath34-adu conversion factor ) and propagating it through all the reduction steps . it turned to be in excellent agreement with the observed r.m.s .  in the region between @xmath35 and @xmath36  that is devoid of sky lines and with the predicted efficiencies estimated by the eso exposure time calculator .",
    "the resulting 1@xmath37 limiting flux density is shown in the lower panel of fig.[ew_lambda ] .",
    ".@xmath38-drop targets in goods - s [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    to obtain the corresponding limit on the detectable ew for a ly@xmath6   line , we have computed three different cases , assuming continuum magnitudes of @xmath39 , to span the luminosity range of our targets . for the computation",
    "we assume that the flux profile is a gaussian with fwhm@xmath40 .",
    "the resulting limiting ew is shown in the upper panel of fig.[ew_lambda ] , computed at the 10@xmath37 level .",
    "we could detect weak ( @xmath41 ) ly@xmath6  lines in our brightest galaxies , and even for the faintest ones we are able to reach @xmath42  over a significant fraction of the redshift interval .",
    "this range of sensitivity is similar to that of @xmath43 surveys ( s07 , v09 , d10 , s10 ) .",
    "we detect only one weak emission line , centered at @xmath44   in the spectrum of the object g2_1408 .",
    "this galaxy is the brightest candidate identified in the hubble ultradeep field ( hudf ) area , and one of the brightest in c10 .",
    "it was first detected by @xcite in the nicmos hudf data , and subsequently identified also by c10 and in the hudf wfc3 data @xcite . from the clear elongation observed in the wfc3 images",
    ", one can exclude the possibility that it is a brown dwarf .",
    "the 2-d and 1-d spectra of g2_1408 are shown in fig.[spectrum ] the spectral feature is extended over 4 pixels in the spatial direction , consistent with the average seeing . the fwhm is @xmath45 , significantly larger than any feature due to noise .",
    "the weak emission line has a total observed flux of @xmath46erg  @xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "the formal s / n is 7 , but this estimate does not include systematic errors , and should be considered as an upper limit .",
    "we made extensive tests to verify the reliability of this detection .",
    "we verified that the feature is present both in the polyn and in the abba reductions , as shown in fig.[spectrum ] .",
    "we then inspected all the 75 individual spectra to ensure that the feature is not due to an artifact , and that it is still detected when we separately summed the data in two halves . because of the large color break ( @xmath47 ) measured in the hudf data and the non  detection in the @xmath48 bands , an identification of this line with a lower redshift [ oii ] or h@xmath6 would imply a very peculiar sed , unlike that of currently known galaxies .",
    "this can not be excluded a priori .",
    "we note that there is no evidence of the asymmetry that is expected ( but not required , see discussion below ) for a @xmath49 galaxy , although the s / n is too poor to reach any firm conclusion about this .    based on these tests ,",
    "we conclude that the feature is likely real and due to ly@xmath6  emission from a @xmath50 galaxy ( @xmath51 if computed at the blue edge of the line ) , although this should be validated by independent and possibly deeper observations .",
    "no continuum is detected in the spectrum : if we estimate it from the hawk ",
    "i y - band magnitude ( table 1 ) , the line flux translates into an observed ew of 103 , corresponding to @xmath52   if placed at @xmath50 .",
    "we do not identify any other emission lines from objects in our sample .",
    "we only detect a faint continuum from two objects , namely g2_2370 ( the brightest in our sample ) and the brown dwarf candidate of @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the continuum is consistent with the broad  band magnitudes but the low s / n prevents us from deriving any robust information about their spectral type or redshift .",
    "the key result of our observations is the lack of prominent ly@xmath6  emission lines in our sample , which may imply a rapid evolution in the physical properties of @xmath53 galaxies and/or in the surrounding igm . to quantify this issue ,",
    "we have carried out the following monte carlo simulations under the assumptions that _ a ) _ all our 7 candidates are indeed @xmath49 galaxies ; and _ b ) _ the distribution of the ly@xmath6  intensity in galaxies as a function of their rest ",
    "frame continuum magnitude @xmath54 does not change significantly from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .    for",
    "the redshift distribution expected for our sample we use the result by c10 ( see their fig 7 ) , which has a broad maximum from @xmath57 to @xmath58 and tails that extend to @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the distribution of the ly@xmath6  intensity in galaxies at @xmath61 has been investigated in a number of studies ( s07 , v09 , s10 , d10 ) , showing that the intensity of ly@xmath6  is anti  correlated with rest  frame uv luminosity .",
    "no measure of the dependence of the ew distribution as a function of @xmath54 has been obtained , however .",
    "we model the ew distribution assuming that at ew@xmath62 it is represented by a gaussian centered on ew=0 with an additional constant tail up to 150 , and at ew@xmath63 by a constant level down to some ew@xmath64 value , and null below .",
    "we take the width of the gaussian and the two tails to reproduce the results of v09 and s10 at different rest ",
    "frame magnitudes .",
    "specifically , we derive from the bright galaxies in v09 a standard deviation for the gaussian of 10 , and assume that it is constant at all magnitudes .",
    "we then divide our sample in two luminosity bins ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) and adjust the two tails in order to reproduce the fraction of galaxies with @xmath67  given by s10 and the fraction of galaxies with ew  @xmath68 and ew@xmath69   ( for the two bins , respectively ) , as given by the v09 data .",
    "the resulting distributions are shown in figure [ ew_sim ] for the two magnitude bins , and are reasonably similar in shape to the ew distribution at @xmath70 ( s07 ) , and show a moderate evolution from the @xmath71 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d10 ) one .",
    "we then compute the probability of detecting @xmath72 ly@xmath6  lines at a given s / n in our sample of 7 objects .",
    "for each object we randomly extract a redshift from the c10 distribution , we compute the corresponding @xmath54 from the observed @xmath73 band magnitude ( taking into account the igm absorption at that redshift ) , and we then randomly extract an ew from the corresponding distribution .",
    "if the ew is larger than the minimum detectable ew at the corresponding wavelength ( fig.[ew_lambda ] ) for a given s / n we conclude that the object would be detected .",
    "we assume fwhm=10  for the line , as found at @xmath74 by @xcite ( see also fig.[ew_lambda ] ) .",
    "clearly , intrinsically broader lines would be harder to detect .",
    "we perform this exercise @xmath75 times over the whole sample , requiring s / n@xmath76 for the detection ( larger than the s /",
    "n of the possible detection in g2_1408 ) , and we finally obtain the probability distribution shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ ew_sim ] . under these assumptions ,",
    "the probability of detecting no ly@xmath6  line in our sample is very small , about 2% , while the typical number of ly@xmath6  that we should have detected is between 2 and 4 .",
    "we also find a low probability ( 4% ) of having 1 detection at s / n@xmath68 , as found in our sample .",
    "the same probability adopting the s07 distribution would be much smaller ( @xmath77 ) , because of the substantial tail of objects with large ew . even using the @xcite distribution , which has a lower fraction of high ew objects ,",
    "the probability is still rather low ( 9% ) .",
    "we conclude that , with all the obvious caveats due to the small size of our sample and to possible observational mishaps , the lack of prominent ly@xmath6  lines in our sample is statistically significant .",
    "on a practical level , our results show how challenging it is to obtain large samples of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at @xmath0 with current instrumentation , especially if one aims at reaching the level of completeness ( @xmath78 ) needed to robustly measure the luminosity function .",
    "our observations imply that this goal will have to wait until a future generation of instruments is available , either 8 m telescopes equipped with multi - object spectrographs more efficient in the @xmath38 and @xmath73 bands or , more likely , the new generation of telescopes , such as the _ james webb space telescope _ or 20 - 40 m ground - based facilities .",
    "nonetheless , our analysis appears to show that the failure to detect prominent ly@xmath6  in our sample is not only due to the insufficiency of current instrumentation .",
    "one possibility is that a significant fraction of the candidates are lower redshift interlopers .",
    "we test this possibility by extrapolating to @xmath18 the observed contamination in spectroscopic samples at @xmath79 , 5 and 6 ( v09 , table 4 of b , v and i dropouts ) , which increases with redshift .",
    "we assume that amongst our z  band dropout sample the fraction of contaminants could be @xmath8025% , i.e. , 2 out of 7 candidates .",
    "this estimate may be pessimistic , given the excellent photometric quality of the hawk  i and wfc3 data , and the more careful cleaning of lower @xmath38 interlopers compared to the v09 samples .",
    "however , the contaminant population may be changing at higher redshifts , and different and previously unstudied galaxy types may be entering the selection window . ignoring these uncertainties",
    ", we repeated the monte carlo simulation for all possible choices of 5 candidates from our 7 , finding that the probability of detecting no ly@xmath6  line at s / n@xmath76 is still rather low , being typically 8% , and only in one case reaching 15% ( this range depends on which candidates are excluded from the sample ) .",
    "another explanation for the paucity of ly@xmath6  detections would be physical evolution of either the galaxies or the surrounding igm .",
    "the intrinsic strength of the ly@xmath6  emission is expected to increase at higher redshift as galaxies become more metal- and dust - poor .",
    "the probability that these photons escape the galaxy and its surroundings , however , depends on a series of complex ( and not fully characterized ) phenomena in the igm surrounding the galaxies ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , including the relative geometry and dynamics of gas and dust , e.g. , backward scattering from wind  driven outflowing shells ( which can even boost the strength of the lines ) , or absorption by the damping wings of in - falling igm along the line of sight .",
    "the presence of hi in proximity to the source can result in an absorption of the intrinsic ly@xmath6  by one order of magnitude or more @xcite , along with a broadening and redshifting of the emerging line profile .",
    "thus , one explanation for the lack of ly@xmath6  detections in our sample is a significant increase in the hi fraction of the igm , @xmath81 , at @xmath18 , leading to a stronger absorption of the ly@xmath6  flux .",
    "a similar effect could explain the observed decrease in the number of ly@xmath6  emitters at @xmath49 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* clment et al . , in prep . ) , but results from these surveys are still contradictory @xcite .",
    "detailed simulations @xcite show that the igm absorption increases dramatically when the universe is not fully ionized , leading to a significant absorption of the emerging ly@xmath6 .",
    "the timescale of this effect around star  forming galaxies is of the order of 100 myr @xcite , shorter than the interval of cosmic time between @xmath82 and @xmath49 .",
    "an additional prediction is that the asymmetry in the line profile is smoothed by the velocity structure of the infalling igm @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the modest s / n in our only detection is too low to address this effect quantitatively .    in conclusion",
    ", this work shows that the spectroscopic confirmation of @xmath49 galaxy candidates is a challenging effort .",
    "however , these difficulties may not be only due to our current technological limits , but may also reflect the long  sought first evidence of the reionization process in the early universe .",
    "future surveys will definitely solve this fascinating puzzle .",
