    "tropical nevanlinna theory may be understood as a cross - road between tropical mathematics and the classical nevanlinna theory , see @xcite for a general background of tropical mathematics and @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the tropical setting of the nevanlinna theory .",

    "recall that halburd and southall @xcite described continuous piecewise linear functions on @xmath0 with one - side integer derivatives as tropical meromorphic functions , and established tropical versions of the first main theorem and the lemma on the logarithmic derivative .",
    "laine and tohge @xcite then showed that tropical nevanlinna theory also holds to piecewise linear functions with arbitrary real slopes , and obtained a tropical version of the second main theorem .",
    "tropical nevanlinna theory actually opens up possibilities for further investigations on value distribution and uniqueness theory of tropical meromorphic functions . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider tropical meromorphic solutions @xmath1 to discrete equations of type @xmath2 where the coefficients @xmath3 are integers and @xmath4 .",
    "these considerations present , in some sense , tropical variants of some classical complex analysis topics such as fermat type equations , a conjecture proposed to hayman , and brck conjecture type results . for the convenience of the reader",
    ", we shortly describe the respective complex analysis background before proceeding to the corresponding tropical reasoning .",
    "recall that we are considering , throughout , a max - plus semi - ring endowing @xmath5 with tropical addition @xmath6 and tropical multiplication @xmath7 we also use @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for @xmath10 .",
    "the identity element @xmath11 for tropical addition is @xmath12 and the identity element @xmath13 for multiplication is @xmath14 .",
    "such a structure is not a ring , for not all elements have tropical additive inverses .",
    "assume that the reader is familiar with the basic notations and results of the tropical nevanlinna theory , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the tropical proximity function for tropical meromorphic functions is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 for @xmath26 . the tropical counting function for poles in @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of distinct poles of @xmath30 in the interval @xmath27 , each pole multiplied by its multiplicity @xmath31 . the tropical characteristic function @xmath32 . following the usual classical notation ,",
    "define the order of @xmath15 as @xmath33 and the hyper - order of @xmath15 by @xmath34    in this paper , we typically need to work with tropical @xmath35-periodic meromorphic functions @xmath36 and with tropical exponential functions .",

    ", we frequently shorten the notations by using the notations @xmath38 etc . for tropical meromorphic functions of period @xmath35 , possibly meaning different functions at different occasions .",
    "in particular , such notations may be used to point out several independent @xmath35-periodic functions are to be considered simultaneously .",
    "we can also write @xmath39 , @xmath40 , etc .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath41 to denote tropical meromorphic functions that are @xmath42-periodic and anti-@xmath35-periodic , again possibly meaning different functions at different occasions .",
    "concerning tropical exponential functions , recall first their definitions , see @xcite , section 1.2.4 : @xmath43}(x-[x])+\\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{[x]-1}\\alpha^{j}=\\alpha^{[x]}\\left(x-[x]+\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a real number . in this case",

    "see @xcite , section 1.2.4 .",
    "in particular , note that tropical exponentials @xmath52 satisfy the equation @xmath53 , for all @xmath54 .",
    "the classical * fermat last theorem * that equation @xmath55 has no non - trivial rational solutions , when @xmath56 , had been proved , after three centuries , by wiles in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "considering @xmath57 in @xmath58 as elements in function fields , we land at looking equations that may be called as fermat type functional equations .",
    "as to meromorphic solutions to the most simple case @xmath59 it is known that @xmath60 has no transcendental meromorphic solutions when @xmath61 , while for @xmath62 such meromorphic solutions are easy to find .    as to meromorphic solutions of the more general case @xmath63 it is known that meromorphic solutions @xmath64 may be found for @xmath65 , see @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein , while for @xmath66 no such meromorphic solutions exist",
    "this non - existence result has been proved by hayman in @xcite , where a detailed presentation for the more general situation @xmath67 is to be found .",
    "observe that the cases @xmath68 remain open for ( [ n3op ] ) .",
    "we now proceed to considering certain fermat type functional equations in the tropical setting .",
    "concerning the most simple case ( [ n2op ] ) , one clearly gets two corresponding tropical equations , namely @xmath69 and @xmath70 asking in both case possible tropical meromorphic solutions @xmath30 and @xmath71 , provided that @xmath72 is a natural number . however , as we are treating tropical meromorphic functions with real slopes , it would be natural to consider @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 are real numbers .    before proceeding ,",
    "recall that tropical polynomials are tropical meromorphic functions that admit finitely many roots and no poles .",
    "equivalently , tropical polynomials may be represented in the form @xmath76 where the coefficients @xmath77 are constants and @xmath78 are real numbers , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . evaluating tropical polynomials in the classical notation results in @xmath81    more generally , tropical meromorphic functions that admit no poles , may be called as tropical entire functions , and they have a series expansion @xmath82 that is , @xmath83 where the exponents @xmath84 are real numbers and @xmath85 , see ( * ? ? ? * chapter 2 ) .    to start with ,",

    ", take @xmath101",
    ". then @xmath102 and @xmath103 are solutions to @xmath104 .",
    "the reasoning used in the remark above applies to prove the following more general case .",
    "[ th3000 ] there are no non - constant tropical entire functions @xmath105 that satisfy @xmath106 where the exponents @xmath107 all are positive .",
    "applying the reasoning in used in the preceding remark , it is immediate to see that a contradiction readily follows whenever one of the functions @xmath105 is tropical entire and non - constant .",
    "of course , the same result follows whenever the exponents @xmath107 all are negative .",
    "however , if there are different signs among the exponents @xmath107 , the claim obviously fails .",

    "indeed , we may take , for example , @xmath119 and @xmath120 . however , finding expressions for general solutions seems to be more complicated , and we are restricting ourselves to considering equations that may be called tropical difference fermat type functional equations .",
    "such an equation corresponding to ( [ prtrop ] ) is @xmath121 where @xmath118 are real numbers , hence @xmath122    the key parts of this paper are then treating similar equations @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",

    "the last two sections are describing tropical counterparts to the hayman conjecture from complex analysis ( section [ hconj ] ) and the brck conjecture ( section [ bruck ] ) .",
    "we start this section by recalling the following theorem , see @xcite , theorem 7.3 and theorem 7.4 ( and making use of the identity @xmath127 ) . observe that this version is formulated for our subsequent needs .",
