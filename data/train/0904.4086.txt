    "both are regions of massive star formation , but dr21 is in a more evolved state ( as evident from the presence of ultracompact h  ii regions ) while dr21(oh ) is in an earlier phase , in which the massive ( proto)stars have not yet substantially ionized the surrounding molecular gas .",

    "the ch@xmath1oh masers were observed in this work with a two - fold goal : to cross - calibrate the 7@xmath0 mm radio continuum and to observe the masers with higher angular resolution ( @xmath14 0.6  versus 1.7 ) and sensitivity ( rms @xmath9 5  versus 50 ) than the observations reported by kurtz et al .",
    "our observations however , have poorer spectral resolution than those of kurtz et al . ( 2004 ) , i.e. , 0.7 versus 0.17 .",

    "( 2004 ) and kogan & slysh ( 1998 ) , the ch@xmath1oh 44@xmath0ghz masers trace a bipolar structure , with blueshifted masers located predominately in the eastern lobe , and red shifted masers located in the western lobe . as proposed by kurtz et al .",
    "( 2004 , see also plambeck & menten 1990 for the case of 95@xmath0ghz ch@xmath1oh masers ) , this organized maser distribution ( in space and velocity ) is likely tracing an outflow in dr21(oh ) . given the mass and temperature of the mm2 core ( mangum et al .",
    "1991 ) , the presence of an east - west molecular outflow ( e.g. , lai et al . 2003 ; chandler et al .",
    "1993b ) and the widespread association of ch@xmath1oh class i masers with young massive stars ( e.g. , ellingsen 2006 ; pratap et al . 2008 ) , the driving source is likely a young massive stellar object somewhere in mm2 , located toward the center of the bipolar maser distribution .",
    "the distribution of masers within each lobe is quite intriguing .",
    "kogan & slysh ( 1998 ) found that the ch@xmath1oh 44@xmath0ghz masers in the blueshifted group are distributed along an arc , suggestive of a bow - shock origin .",
    "the higher sensitivity observations of kurtz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) confirm the morphology in the blue lobe and show the presence of a possible second arc .",
    "our still higher sensitivity observations enable a more detailed characterization of the ch@xmath1oh maser distribution in dr21(oh ) .",
    "our data confirm the two - arc maser distribution of the eastern ( blue ) lobe and reveal that the masers in the _ western _ lobe are also grouped in two arc - like structures . as explicitly suggested by thin lines in figure  4 , the ch@xmath1oh masers appear to trace two nested bow - shocks in the outflow .",
    "this distribution is remarkably similar to the jet bow - shock outflow model shown by arce et al .",
    "the occurrence of sequential bow - shocks ( outflow events ) is also reminiscent of the morphology of the outflow in dr21 ( smith et al .",
    "clearly , the sky distribution of the ch@xmath1oh masers traces a 2d projection of a 3d structure ; the masers might originate in a cut through parabolic - like outflow lobes where the velocity coherence and beaming are favorable for maser amplification toward our line of sight .",
    "given the symmetric bow - shock morphology and the low velocity gradient between the red and blueshifted maser groups ( @xmath15 , figure  4 ) , it appears that the outflow is almost in the plane of the sky . assuming that the ch@xmath1oh masers are tracing two individual ( nested ) outflow events , and assuming , for simplicity , a constant expansion velocity of 100  for each lobe ( e.g. , as observed in h@xmath16o masers in iras@xmath020126 + 4104 , moscadelli et al .",
    "2005 ) , then the dynamical ages are @xmath17yr and @xmath18yr for the inner and outer shocks , respectively ( a distance of 2@xmath0kpc was assumed ) , i.e. , the lower limit of the outflow age is @xmath18yr .",
    "thus , the outflow could be quite young  younger than the ` pulsed ' outflow in cep - a ( e.g. , bally 2008 ) .",
    "however , we note that high angular resolution ( vlbi ) proper motion studies are required to determine the velocity of the ch@xmath1oh masers in the region",
    ". in particular , ch@xmath1oh molecules may not survive in high velocity j - shock environments ( e.g. , garay et al . 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , the ch@xmath1oh masers may be tracing a slower shock traveling along the high speed flow and/or the working surface between two shocks .    a complication to the single - outflow interpretation of the ch@xmath1oh masers in dr21(oh )",
    "is the misalignment between the arcs , particularly with respect to the eastern arc ( figure  4 ; i.e. , a change in position angle of @xmath915  east of north ) .",
    "such a change in position angle could result from jet precession combined with inhomogeneities in the molecular gas that is interacting with the flow , similar to the large scale outflow in g192.16@xmath193.82 ( devine et al .",
    "nevertheless , despite the misalignment , the outflow seems to be quite collimated , with an apparently constant opening cross - section at scales greater than 10@xmath20au ( @xmath90.05@xmath0pc ) from the symmetry center .      in order to investigate the driving source of the ch@xmath1oh maser outflow in dr21(oh ) , we conducted sub - arcsecond radio continuum observations at 3.6@xmath0 cm , 1.3@xmath0 cm , and 7@xmath0 mm ( figure  1 ) .",
    "we detected eight radio continuum sources ( see table  3 ) . in figure  4",
    "we show the ch@xmath1oh velocity field superimposed on the 3.6@xmath0 cm continuum map .",
    "one of the 3.6@xmath0 cm continuum sources ( r1 ) is located close to the projected center of the ch@xmath1oh maser outflow ; it may mark the position of the massive ( proto)star that drives the outflow .",
    "alternatively , dr21(oh)-r1 could mark the position of a young low - mass star .",
    "the radio emission could be gyro - synchrotron radiation from an active magnetosphere , just as the low mass companion of @xmath21 ori a ( felli et al . 1993 ) or the variable radio source in iras@xmath020126 + 4104 ( hofner et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the detection of other weak radio sources ( r5 , r6 and possibly r2 ; figure  1 ) , that together with r1 may represent the high end of the ( radio ) luminosity function of a cluster of low mass objects forming among the young massive stars .    in table  5",
    "we list the spectral index between 3.6 and 1.3@xmath0 cm of all sources detected at both wavelengths .",
    "the spectral indexes of r1 , r2 , r5 , and r6 ( a different interpretation of the radio emission from r3 and r4 is given below ) are between @xmath22 and 0.4 , which is similar to the range of spectral index variability of the low mass star in @xmath21 ori a ( felli et al . 1993 ) .",
    "further observations of the weak population of radio sources in dr21(oh ) are necessary to assess whether the radio emission is variable as expected from the gyro - synchrotron hypothesis , and with this , to study how low - mass pre - main - sequence stars ( class i / ii ) and very young class 0 high - mass objects can coexist considering their clearly different evolutionary timescales .    in contrast to the radio emission from r1 , r5 , and r6 ( and possibly r2 ) , the radio sources mm1-nw , mm1-se , r3 and r4 appear to be related to the massive young stellar object in mm1 .",
    "we propose that these radio sources are tracing shock - ionized gas in the jet from a young massive star .",
    "we prefer this interpretation because :    \\1 .",
    "mm1-nw , se , r3 and r4 are collinear ( southeast - northwest orientation ) , which suggests a common driving source .",
    "\\2 . in principle",
    "the similar flux densities of mm1-nw and se could be explained by radio emission from two hypercompact h  ii regions that are in a very similar evolutionary state .",
    "however , the morphology of the two radio sources is also similar ; after deconvolution , both sources appear to be elongated at approximately the same position angle ( @xmath23 ; see table 3 ) .",
    "this position angle is almost perpendicular to the mm1-nw to r4 orientation ( i.e. , orthogonal to the putative jet ; see figure  1 ) , and may arise from a bow shock aligned with the mm1-nw to r4 axis",
    ". the elongation would result from our edge - on view of the shocks , corresponding to the broad tail of a relatively large - opening - angle bow shock , emitting free - free radiation .",
    "given the symmetry , we consider it more likely that mm1-nw and se are manifestations of a single radio jet .",
    "the spectral indexes between x and k bands are very similar for mm1-nw and se ( @xmath24 ) ; in addition , the spectral index of r4 is also similar to those of mm1-nw and se within the errors ( table  5 ) .",
    "a spectral index of @xmath25 is consistent with thermal emission from finite stratified density gas being ionized by uv photons from the cooling region of a shock ( e.g. , ghavamian & hartigan 1998 ) .",
    "the weak radio emission supports the interpretation that the most massive stellar object in mm1 is a high mass protostellar object ( hmpo ; e.g. , beuther et al . 2007 ) .    in figure  1",
    "we show the location of 6.7@xmath0ghz ch@xmath1oh masers ( harvey - smith et al .",
    "2008 ) and h@xmath16o masers ( palmer & goss , _ in prep . _ ) .",
    "the h@xmath16o masers are distributed throughout the region , and thus are unlikely to be driven by a single young stellar object .",
    "two of the weak radio sources ( r1 and r6 ) may be associated with h@xmath16o masers , and another h@xmath16o maser is found almost at the center of mm1-nw / se .",
    "the detection of a h@xmath16o maser at the center of the double radio source is reminiscent of iras@xmath020126 + 4104 ( hofner et al .",
    "2007 ; moscadelli et al .",
    "2005 ) where a clump of h@xmath16o masers is also located toward the center of a double radio source .",
    "the radio continuum emission associated with the h@xmath16o masers in iras@xmath020126 + 4104 is likely due to shock - ionized gas in the jet from a young massive star ( see also @xmath26 ) .      as evident from figure  1 , the 7@xmath0 mm source has the elongation expected from superposition of emission from mm1-nw , se , r2 , r3 , and r4 when observed with lower angular resolution .",
    "the southeast  northwest elongation is also consistent with the 2@xmath0 cm continuum map shown by fish et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . to further investigate the nature of the 7@xmath0 mm source we convolved the 3.6 and 1.3@xmath0 cm observations to the synthesized beam of the 7@xmath0 mm map . in figure  5",
    "we show the ( radio ) flux density distribution of mm1 after convolution , i.e. , mm1-nw + se + r2 + r3 + r4 .",
    "the 7@xmath0 mm flux density point lies slightly above the power law fit .",
    "this indicates that at 7 mm the flux is dominated by free - free emission with a small ( @xmath27mjy or 10@xmath28 of the total flux density ) excess , most likely due to thermal dust emission .",

    "[ 2007 ] for a larger scale view of the region ) .",
    "excess in the 4.5@xmath29 m band is a known tracer of shocks ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2006 ; cyganowski et al . 2008 ) , thus , figure  6 exemplifies that star formation in dr21(oh ) is not limited to the mm cores but is found throughout the region .",
    "the eastern ch@xmath1oh arcs may be associated with 4.5@xmath29 m excess emission , however there is no clear evidence for 4.5@xmath29 m excess toward the western arcs .    shocked gas in the region has also been studied by davis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) based on h@xmath16 2.12@xmath29 m observations .",
    "these authors did not find h@xmath16 emission corresponding to the ch@xmath1oh masers .",
    "this might be due to the high optical depth at 2.12@xmath29 m for these deeply embedded regions in the vicinity of mm1 and mm2 . however , slightly outside the area shown in figure  4 , davis et al .",

    "a.2 of davis et al .",
    "[ 2007 ] ) .",
    "the mm1 radio continuum sources are almost coincident with the peak of an extended `` red '' object ( see figure  6 ) ; the infrared counterpart of mm1 was also detected at 24@xmath29 m ( saturated ) and 70@xmath29 m with mips .",
    "figure  6 also shows a `` blue '' star located very close to the symmetry center of the ch@xmath1oh outflow .",
    "the star is clearly detected at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath29 m ( brighter at 3.6@xmath29 m ) and tentatively detected at 5.8@xmath29 m blended with the mm1 emission .",
    "the star is also detected in j , h , and k bands ( 2mass ) , and in optical dss images .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) colors of the `` blue '' object are intriguing .",
    "the 2mass colors are @xmath30 = 0.32 and @xmath31 = 0.11 , which , if placed into a nir color - color diagram ( e.g. , hillenbrand et al . 1998 , meyer et al .",
    "1997 , marston et al .",
    "2004 , apai et al .",
    "2005 ) , are consistent with an early f - type main sequence star with @xmath91 mag of optical extinction .",
    "if it is a f0 star , then to attain v = 13 mag ( as roughly observed ) , such a star would be at a distance of @xmath9700@xmath0pc , and hence would not be associated with the dr21 region .",
    "however , the _ spitzer _",
    "colors are inconsistent with this interpretation . if the optical extinction were 1 mag , a _ spitzer _",
    "irac color of [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] = 0.53 could not be caused by extinction , because this color indicates much higher extinction values ( @xmath3210 mag ) .",
    "hence , the blue object could still be associated with the dr21 region , and other circumstances ( unresolved multiplicity , existence of a transitional circumstellar disk , etc . ) might govern the infrared colors .",
    "based on the current data , it is hard to decide whether the blue object is the driving source for the ch@xmath1oh outflow . an in - depth investigation of the nature of this near - ir source is beyond the scope of this work , and should be the topic of a future study .",
    "it is interesting to compare the characteristics of the radio emission in dr21(oh ) with that of other young massive stellar objects , in particular g31.41@xmath33 and iras@xmath020126 + 4104 ( araya et al .",
    "2003 , 2008 ; hofner et al .",
    "2007 ) . in all three cases ,",
    "there are multiple radio continuum sources toward the center of molecular cores .",
    "some of the continuum sources are consistent with radio emission from shock - ionized gas and not due to direct photo - ionization from an embedded massive star ( see for example figure  1 of hofner et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the intermediate mass object ggd27 ( hh80/81 ) is a clear example of ionized knots moving along a collimated jet as shown by proper motion studies ( mart et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "we propose that there is a period during the formation of massive stars when ( possibly recurrent ) jet events interact with the molecular core and ionize the medium via shocks .",
    "such a process could produce the double radio sources we have detected in the core of several young massive star forming regions .",
    "the ionization process would eventually become dominated by the development of hypercompact and then ultracompact h  ii regions .      the data reported in this paper show regularities in the orientation of outflows among themselves and also with respect to the large scale distribution of dust and gas in the region .",
    "the angular distance between the mm1 radio emission and the geometrical center of the ch@xmath1oh outflow ( see figure  4 ) is too large to assume that the driving source of the outflow is located in mm1 . thus , our data indicate the presence of two distinct young massive stellar objects ( or systems ) with nearly parallel outflows / jets ; i.e. , both the putative mm1-nw to r4 jet and the ch@xmath1oh outflow have similar position angles ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this suggests that the orientation of jets / outflows is , to first order , determined by the large scale properties of the parent cloud .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the powerful outflow from dr21 which also has a dominant east - west orientation ( e.g. , marston et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the statistically significant orientation of the outflows in an east - west direction was also discussed by davis et al .",
    "other examples of quasi - parallel outflow from different young massive stellar objects within the same star forming region include cep - a and iras@xmath005358 + 3543 ( beuther et al .",

    "2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "the outflows are mostly perpendicular to the large scale north - south filament , and approximately aligned with the large scale direction of the magnetic field through the filament , which , as discussed by valle & fiege ( 2006 ) , shows a predominant east - west orientation ( see also lai et al .",
    "if the outflows arise from ( proto)stars with accretion disks , then the disks would tend to be oriented edge - on along the filament , with disk symmetry axes oriented east-west.oh masers and oriented east - west .",

    "( 2007 ) , throughout the large scale filament in the dr21-dr21(oh ) region we find that the outflows / jets are quite parallel in a @xmath9 east - west direction , which is perpendicular to the ( north - south ) filament .",
    "this suggests that the accretion disks form mostly edge - on along the large scale filament , i.e. , disk symmetry axis orthogonal to the filament elongation .",
