    "strongly interacting systems governed by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) manifests various interesting features . in terms of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , qcd is believed to indicate the confinement as well as the asymptotic freedom . at small strong - coupling regions ,",
    "perturbative treatments have been successfully applied to investigate various physics problems at high energies . in contrast , due to the nontrivial qcd vacuum structure , the low - energy quark - gluon dynamics turns out to be very complicated , resulting in developments of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations and effective approaches .",
    "although lqcd has proved itself as a powerful method based on the first principle , i.e. qcd , it still contains several problematic issues , such as the notorious sign problem for finite - density qcd matters for instance . in turn , the effective approaches have been developed taking into account relevant symmetries in the nonperturbative regions and shown profound understandings for the nonperturbative qcd with many practical and successful applications  @xcite .    among the various kinds of those effective approaches ,",
    "the instanton - vacuum configuration has accumulated reliable theoretical results and interpretations for numerous physical problems , such as the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sbcs )  @xcite , qcd vacuum properties  @xcite , structure functions for the mesons and baryons  @xcite , qcd matter at finite temperature and/or density  @xcite , and so on .",
    "note that the instanton is a semi - classical solution of the yang - mills equation in euclidean space  @xcite .",
    "the instanton vacuum is characterized by two phenomenological _ instanton _ parameters , i.e. average ( anti)instanton size @xmath7 fm and average inter-(anti)instanton distance @xmath8 fm  @xcite . in the dilute ensemble of these pseudoparticles , representing the nontrivial qcd vacuum ,",
    "the quarks are delocalized and acquire their dynamically - generated effective masses , which depend on the transferred momentum  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this momentum dependence plays the role of a uv regulator by construction so that artificial form factors for the quark - loop divergences are not necessary .    by performing an appropriate bosonization process",
    ", we can obtain an effective chiral action ( echa ) , manifesting the nonlocal interactions between the quarks and pseudoscalar ( ps ) mesons  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that echa is very useful to study the hadron physics in terms of the ps meson and quarks .",
    "there have been many attempts to extend echa , defined properly in euclidean space , to minkowski space by considering an analytic continuation between them  @xcite . for definiteness",
    ", we name the model defined in minkowski space as the nonlocal chiral - quark model ( nlchqm ) , although the naming is often used for different effective models in literatures . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , nlchqm has applied to the studies for the light - cone ps - meson wave function and given reliable results in comparison with other theories and experiments .",
    "note that nlchqm inherits the specific features of the instanton model as understood , and possesses the similar symmetries and their breakdown patterns .",
    "recently , much interest has been paid to the heavy meson and baryons , which contain the heavy - flavor quarks , i.e. @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , from theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite points of view .",
    "especially , energetic studies have been done by many experimental collaborations like d@xmath12  @xcite , babar  @xcite , belle  @xcite , bes  @xcite , and so on . also in the heavy - ion collision ( rhic )  @xcite and proton-(anti)proton scattering ( lhc , tevatron )  @xcite experiments , the heavy - hadron productions from the fire ball have been attracting interest . from the theoretical side , the nonperturbative qcd with the heavy - quark d.o.f .",
    "have been investigated actively in terms of the heavy - quark effective field theory ( hqeft )  @xcite . in hqeft",
    ", there appear interesting features , such as the heavy - quark symmetry and velocity super - selection rule in the heavy - quark limit @xmath13 .",
    "the heavy - quark symmetry consists of those for the heavy quark spin and flavor . according to them , we have the mass degeneracy between the pseudoscalar ( scalar ) and vector ( axial - vector ) heavy - meson states and the heavy - quark dirac equation without the heavy - quark current mass .",
    "successful applications of hqeft can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    considering the successes of nlchqm and hqeft for the light- and heavy - quark sectors , respectively as mentioned above ,",
    "it is quite natural and challenging to combine these two approaches and extend them to an effective model for the heavy - light quark systems .",
    "we want to name this new approach as the extended nonlocal chiral - quark model ( exnlchqm )  @xcite .",
    "note that there were similar tries in the contexts of the nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite and effective chiral lagrangians  @xcite .",
    "however , exnlchqm inherits many useful and unique benefits from its origins , i.e. nlchqm and hqeft , such as the heavy - quark symmetry , natural uv regulator , nonlocal quark - ps meson interactions , ( relatively ) strong constraints on the renormalization scale , and so on , as discussed previously .",
    "we found that exnlchqm can reproduce the weak - decay constants for the non - strange heavy ps mesons for the su(4 ) @xmath14-flavor sector , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , although there were uncertainties in the model parameters for the heavy - quark side  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are alternative attempts to incorporate the heavy - light quark systems , employing the instanton physics  @xcite .",
    "hence , in the present work , we want to extend our previous work into the strange heavy ps mesons for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the flavor su(5 ) sector , i.e. @xmath19 flavors .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the inclusion of the strangeness even for nlchqm in the flavor su(3 ) is not a simple task , according to that the effects from the @xmath20 corrections plays a crucial role .",
    "thus , in order to incorporate the explicit strangeness with exnlchqm , in principle , one needs to take into account the meson - loop corrections , corresponding to the @xmath20 ones , as done in refs .",
    "moreover , it is worth mentioning that the axial - vector current conservation is of importance and the _ nonlocal _ contribution is necessary in order to conserve the current  @xcite . instead of including the meson - loop and nonlocal contributions explicitly in the present work",
    ", however , we devise a very phenomenological way to circumvent these problematic issues for exnlchqm , using the empirical information for @xmath21 mev and @xmath22 mev and their ratios .",
    "detailed explanations will be given in section iii .",
    "once having computed the theoretical results for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we can estimate the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements via various leptonic and mesonic decay channels of the heavy ps mesons .",
    "thus , these heavy ps - meson weak - decay constants are very important physical quantities for studying @xmath25 violation and have been studied extensively in numerous theoretical approaches , such as the light - cone formalism ( lc )  @xcite , light - front quark model ( lqm )  @xcite , field - correlator method ( fc )  @xcite , bethe - salpeter method ( bs )  @xcite , relativistic quark model ( rqm )  @xcite , qcd sum rule ( qcdsr )  @xcite , and lqcd  @xcite . from the numerical results in the present work , we obtain @xmath4 mev , which are in good agreement with experimental and other theoretical values  @xcite . using the present results",
    ", we estimate the ckm matrix elements and the cabibbo angle , resulting in @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "again we find those numerical results are well compatible with available data  @xcite .",
    "these results indicate the reliability of the present theoretical framework .    the present work is organized as follows : in section",
    "ii , we briefly introduce nlchqm motivated by the instanton vacuum configuration .",
    "nlchqm is extended to exnlchqm with hqeft in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to numerical results and corresponding discussions .",
    "summary of the present work and future perspectives are given in section v.",
    "first , we want to make a brief explanation on an effective model , motivated by the instanton vacuum configurations .",
    "the model describes the highly - nonlocal interactions between the quarks and nonperturbative gluons , i.e. the instanton solution in euclidean space  @xcite . by a proper bosonization process similar to that for the njl model  @xcite , integrating out all the meson fields except for the su@xmath26 multiplet ps mesons , one arrives at the following effective action : @xmath27=-\\mathrm{sp}\\ln\\left[i\\rlap{/}{\\partial}+i\\hat{m}_q+i \\sqrt{m_q}u_5\\sqrt{m_q}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 stand for the light ps - meson field and current - quark mass matrix for the flavor su(3 ) , @xmath30 . @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the functional trace over relevant spin indices and momentum - dependent effective - quark mass for the light - flavor quarks @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "generically , @xmath34 is defined by the modified bessel functions in momentum space by  @xcite @xmath35 , \\,\\,\\,\\,t=\\frac{\\sqrt{p^2}\\bar{\\rho}}{2}.\\ ] ] we note that @xmath36 comes from the fourier transform of the instanton zero mode  @xcite . in many applications",
    ", @xmath34 is parameterized for simplicity as follows : @xmath37 in the present work , we will use eq .",
    "( [ eq : efmpara ] ) for numerical calculations , since there are only small differences between the usages of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : efm ] ) and ( [ eq : efmpara ] ) as shown in figure  [ fig0 ] .",
    "the self - consistent equation of the model for the chiral limit reads  @xcite : @xmath38 if we make use of the phenomenological instanton parameters @xmath8 fm and @xmath7 fm , the value of @xmath39 is determined to be about @xmath40 mev via eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdl ] ) .",
    "thus , we will use this value for @xmath39 and a renormalization scale of the model @xmath41 mev throughout the present work .     as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath42 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : efm ] ) ( solid ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : efmpara ] ) ( dot ) . here",
    ", we employ @xmath43 mev and @xmath44 mev.,width=321 ]    taking into account the nonzero current - quark mass beyond the chiral limit , the weak - decay constant for the ps meson , we have the following formula for the leading _ local _ contribution for @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath47 } { ( p^2+\\bar{m}^2_f)(p^2+\\bar{m}^2_g)},\\ ] ] where we have defined the notations as @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the quark for each flavor inside the ps meson @xmath52 . throughout this work",
    ", we employ the normalization as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 mev .",
    "note that we introduced a phenomenological multiplicable factor @xmath55 and will explain the meaning of this parameter in detail below .",
    "first , choosing @xmath56 , we have the following numerical values using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpi ] ) : @xmath57 in order to obtain the empirical value for @xmath21 mev , one has @xmath58 , taking into account the isospin symmetry @xmath59 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpik ] ) . as for the kaon",
    ", @xmath60 reproduces the empirical value for @xmath22 mev .",
    "below , we want to explain the physical meanings of these @xmath61 parameters in detail :    * in order for satisfying the axial - vector - current conservation for the pcac relation in the nonlocal effective model in terms of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , one needs to include _ nonlocal _ contributions additionally to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpi ] )  @xcite , although we have ignored them for simplicity .",
    "they provide about @xmath62 increase of relevant physical quantities in this model .",
    "hence , @xmath63 slightly bigger than unity compensate the absence of the nonlocal contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpi ] ) .",
    "this simplification can be understood easily by the following : @xmath64 where",
    "the superscripts l and nl indicate the leading local and sub - leading nonlocal contributions , respectively , while the subscripts @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent the quark flavors inside the ps meson in the flavor su(3 ) symmetry @xmath67 . *",
    "if we go beyond the flavor su(3 ) symmetry and the heavier strange quark comes into play , breaking the symmetry @xmath68 , the situation gets complicated : one needs to consider the @xmath20 corrections  @xcite , which also corresponds to the meson - loop corrections ( mlc ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 , which is considerably larger than unity , plays the role of mlc effectively as @xmath70 here , the subscript @xmath71 stands for the ps meson including the heavier strange quark , i.e. the kaon .",
    "thus , @xmath55 can be understood as a very phenomenological compensation for the above two simplifications to reproduce the empirical data .",
    "the differences in @xmath72 may also indicate the distinctive interaction strengths between the flavors and the qcd vacuum , as observed in usual constituent - quark models . in what follows",
    ", @xmath72 will be used for computing the heavy - meson decay constants with strangeness , instead of cosidering the nonlocal ( @xmath73 ) and mlc ( @xmath74 ) contributions explicitly .",
    "we verified that this phenomenological approach makes the problems much simpler to a great extent analytically as well as numerically .",
    "moreover , the numerical results obtained from this approach are turned out to be qualitatively - well compatible with other experimental and theoretical studies as shown in section iv .",
    ".numerical inputs for the relevant masses [ mev ] for the calculations  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the present work , we have investigated the weak - decay constants for the heavy ps - mesons consisting of the @xmath19 flavors , i.e. @xmath75 . to this end , we employ flavor su(5 ) exnlchqm which was developed being motivated by hqeft and nlchqm .",
    "we chose the cutoff masses for the light and heavy quarks differently as @xmath76 mev and @xmath77 mev , respectively , considering that the nontrivial qcd vacuum effects are finite even for the heavy quark inside the meson .",
    "in what follows , we list important observations in the present work :    * we employ a phenomenological correction factor for the inclusion of the strange quark , compensating the @xmath20 corrections . by doing that",
    ", we obtain @xmath4 mev , which are qualitatively compatible with available experimental and theoretical values . thus , this correction factor turns out to be crucial to reproduce the data . * in other words , this",
    "qualitatively good agreements with the data indicate considerable contributions for the heavy quarks from the nontrivial qcd - vacuum effects .",
    "moreover , it is justified that the vacuum structure due to the heavy quarks is modified in comparison to that for the light quarks by seeing that @xmath78 , since @xmath79 value denotes the average size of ( anti)instantons .",
    "this tendency also signals the breakdown of the su(5 ) flavor symmetry at the quark level , in addition to @xmath80 . * the nonrelativistic heavy - meson wave functions at zero separation between the light and heavy quarks , @xmath81 ,",
    "are calculated . from those numerical results , we observe that the ratio between the wave functions for the strange and non - strange heavy mesons is less than unity .",
    "this observation is quite different from simple consideration in quark models , i.e. @xmath82 . *",
    "the ckm matrix elements are estimated by using the various leptonic decays of the heavy ps mesons , resulting in that @xmath83 .",
    "taking into account the mass difference between the heavy and light mixing of @xmath84-@xmath85 states , although there are uncertainties arising from the bag parameters in sm , we have @xmath86 .",
    "again , these values are well comparable with their empirical and lqcd simulation data . *",
    "accounting for the hadronic decays for the heavy meson and their ratios , we compute the flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking factor as @xmath87 . the cabibbo angle can be also estimated using this information , resulting in @xmath6 , depending on the choice of the ps - meson form factor .",
    "we note that these values are consistent with its empirical data and lqcd results .    taking into account all the results summarized above",
    ", we can conclude that the present theoretical framework , exnlchqm is a qualitatively successful model to study the heavy ps meson , which consist of the heavy and light quarks . as for the future improvements of the present form of exnlchqm ,",
    "1 ) the nonlocal contributions for conserving the axial - vector current can be included to compute the weak - decay constants .",
    "furthermore , 2 ) the @xmath20 corrections can be included in the present framework in principle via standard functional treatments , instead of using the phenomenological correction factor , although this task must quite challenging .",
    "nonetheless for these possible improvements , from a phenomenological point of view , the present theoretical framework is still a considerably useful tool to investigate various physical quantities for the heavy - light quark systems , such as the isgur - wise function , heavy - light meson coupling constants , heavy - meson effective lagrangians , and so on .",

    "<S> in addition to the heavy - quark symmetry and the nonlocal interactions between quarks and pseudoscalar mesons in exnlchqm , a correction for the strange - quark content inside @xmath1 and @xmath3 is also taken into account and found to be crucial to reproduce the empirical values . from those numerical results , </S>",
