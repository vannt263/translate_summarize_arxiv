    "the accessible information is then the _ mutual information _",
    "@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the shannon entropy of the joint probability distribution .",
    "the fundamental result of holevo gives  @xcite an upper bound for the mutual information , independent of the measurement : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the von  neumann entropy of the state @xmath15 .",

    "any quantum operation @xmath24 on the system can by seen as a global unitary dynamics followed by the partial trace over the environment : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a unitary matrix of the total system @xmath27 and @xmath28 denotes the partial trace over the environment .",
    "the map @xmath24 is completely positive and can be represented in kraus form : @xmath29 where the operators @xmath30 are determined by minors of @xmath26 . due to the unitarity of @xmath26",

    ". then @xmath116 .    as a simple application consider the case of an ensemble with 2 elements . to obtain the lowest upper bound for qjsd we need to minimize the entropy of the correlation matrix  ( [ sigma2 ] ) over sets of unitaries @xmath117 .",
