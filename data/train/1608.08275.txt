    "the science of manipulating stress waves propagating through discrete media has attracted significant research interest in recent years .",
    "a granular crystal can be such a medium , which is a periodic structure composed of discrete particles that interact elastically as per hertz s contact law @xcite . at a fundamental level ,",
    "the periodicity in granular crystals causes bragg scattering , which allows them to filter a range of elastic waves , thereby forming frequency band structures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such structures are special in the sense that the system dynamics can be tuned from linear to highly nonlinear regimes , simply by changing the initial static compression applied externally  @xcite .",
    "thus , due to the tunable interplay of nonlinearity and discreteness , these systems have become popular testbeds for demonstrating a wide range of nonlinear wave phenomena , for example , solitary waves @xcite , shock waves @xcite , discrete breathers @xcite , energy cascades @xcite , and nanoptera @xcite .    by leveraging this remarkable tunability , we direct our efforts to study isospectral systems based on granular media .",
    "isospectral systems refer to a family of systems with identical spectra . in mechanical settings",
    ", these isospectral systems would represent a group of structures with identical eigenfrequencies .",
    "the existence of isospectral systems is closely linked to a non - uniqueness problem , which was articulately posed as `` can we hear the shape of a drum ? '' in the famous paper of m. kac  @xcite .",
    "the non - uniqueness lies in the possibility of constructing multiple structures ( shapes ) from a given set of eigenfrequencies ( hearing ) @xcite . in the past",
    ", this avenue has been primarily investigated as an inverse problem @xcite .",
    "it is only recent that such systems , in conjunction with the systems inspired by a closely related principle of supersymmetry @xcite , have gained renewed interest in a broad spectrum of research communities , especially in the context of designing strategic architectures to control wave transmission characteristics . for example , transparent interfaces @xcite , mode converters @xcite , reflection - less bent waveguides @xcite , and supersymmetric optical structures  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "these concepts have also driven fundamental studies on bloch oscillations in defective @xcite and disordered @xcite lattices . however , wave transmission characteristics in mechanical isospectral systems have not been relatively unexplored . moreover , the effect of nonlinearity in the dynamics of initially isospectral systems is also a fundamental question to be answered .",
    "owing to the fact that a tunable granular system can be used as a fertile testbed to explore both of these issues , our aim in the present work is to harness the wealth of mathematical schemes , such as discrete and continuous spectral transformations in order to generate a family of isospectral granular chains . in the linear regime , we evaluate and compare elastic wave transmission characteristics of these systems .",
    "inspired by the principle of supersymmetry , we extend our mathematical framework to construct a class of granular chains that have specific eigenfrequencies added or removed . in this way , we show that the entire framework gives us remarkable freedom in constructing a general class of granular chains with desired wave transmission characteristics in the linear regime . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", we focus on studying the versatile dynamics of isospectral granular chains , and discuss how the dynamics deviates from the linear expectation of isospectrality with the extent of nonlinearity in the medium .    this manuscript is structured as follows : in section ii , we present a mathematical model of granular systems and formulate their equations of motion .",
    "we then linearize the system , which we use for constructing isospectral chains . in section iii",
    ", we explain spectral transformation schemes to get isospectral spring - mass systems . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the possibility of constructing a family of isospectral systems in the setting of granular chains , such that their linearized systems share the same eigenfrequencies .",
    "additionally , we introduce a strategy for removing or adding eigenfrequencies from the linearized system of a granular chain . in section",
    "v , both linear and nonlinear dynamics of the family of such granular chains is studied and compared , while in section vi we summarize our findings and present our conclusions , as well as a number of directions for future study .",
    "in this work we are interested in granular chains consisting of spherical beads that interact through the hertzian contact law ( i.e. , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the beads compressive force and displacement , respectively )  @xcite . in particular , we consider a granular chain , denoted by ( ns-1 ) , that has @xmath3 spherical beads .",
    "suppose the chain is bounded by half - spaces from both ends and the chain starts with precompression between contacting beads and between the end bead and the half - space as well . for simplicity , we assume that all beads and the half - spaces are made from the same material , so that they share the same density @xmath4 , young s modulus @xmath5 , and poisson s ratio @xmath6",
    ". however , the beads can have different radii @xmath7 , which will lead to different masses @xmath8 and different inter - particle contact stiffnesses @xmath9 , as shown below : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s are solely functions of the radii , provided that the material of the beads do not change .",
    "then the equations of motion for the granular chain can be written as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 due to the hertzian contact , @xmath18 denotes the precompression between @xmath19-th and @xmath20-th beads , @xmath21 is the displacement of the @xmath20-th bead , and @xmath22 .    if @xmath23 is a steady - state solution to the system ( i.e. , @xmath21 is measured with respect to its equilibrium position ) , the precompression should satisfy @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant controlling the static precompression applied to the granular chain . to study the linear limit of the system",
    ", we assume the displacements @xmath26 and linearize the equations  ( [ eqn0_gran_1 ] ) as : @xmath27 where @xmath16 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "we notice that this set of equations actually describes a ( linear ) spring - mass system , which we denote as ( s-1 ) , with masses @xmath8 and springs @xmath30",
    ". the equations  ( [ eqn0_ln_1 ] ) can also be written using matrices as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "+ it is known that isospectral spring - mass systems can be constructed such that they bear the same natural frequencies as those in ( s-1 )  @xcite . in the coming section iii",
    ", we briefly review this approach and upgrade it by introducing a continuous isospectral transformation .",
    "then we take a further step to tailor and apply the `` enhanced '' method for constructing isospectral granular chains , which is described in section iv .",
    "to find the eigenfrequencies of the spring - mass system ( s-1 ) , which is described by  ( [ eqn0_ln_1 ] ) , we set @xmath34 and @xmath35 in equation  ( [ eqn0_ln_matrix ] ) and solve the eigenvalue system @xmath36 let @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then the eigenvalue problem yields @xmath39 where the eigenvalues @xmath40 of @xmath41 give the eigenfrequencies ( @xmath42 ) of the spring - mass system . here",
    "we call @xmath41 the associated matrix of the spring - mass system ( s-1 ) , and the following remarks explain the relationships between a spring - mass system and its associated matrix .",
    "[ remark_mass_spring_1 ] if a spring - mass system has positive masses and spring constants , i.e. , @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath29 , then its associated matrix @xmath41 satisfies the following conditions :    * @xmath41 is a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix ; * all entries on the main diagonal are real , and all off - diagonal entries are negative ; * @xmath41 is positive definite .",
    "( see appendix for proof )    in particular , for the linearized system of a granular chain system , its associated matrix @xmath41 satisfies all aforementioned conditions .",
    "[ remark_mass_spring_2 ] if @xmath46 is a @xmath47 matrix and it satisfies conditions ( a1)(a3 ) , then there exists a family of spring - mass systems with positive parameters @xmath48 such that    * each spring - mass system in this family has positive masses @xmath49 and spring constants @xmath50 ; * the associated matrix of each spring - mass system in this family is @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , if we additionally require that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are fixed in the spring - mass system , then there is only one spring - mass system in the family and it satisfies @xmath53 .",
    "( see appendix for proof )    [ remark_mass_spring_3 ] let @xmath54 be the space of @xmath47 matrices that satisfy conditions ( a1)(a3 ) .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the space of spring - mass systems with masses and springs satisfying @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "if we define a function by mapping a spring - mass system in @xmath55 to its associated matrix , then it will be a smooth bijective function connecting @xmath55 and @xmath54 .",
    "as these remarks suggest , it is sufficient to consider the matrices in @xmath54 for investigating the eigenfrequencies of spring - mass systems .",
    "that is to say , we will be able to obtain isospectral spring - mass systems if we can find some transformation that maps within @xmath54 ( i.e. , retains the conditions ( a1)(a3 ) ) and keeps the eigenvalues invariant .",
    "for isospectral flow that maps the matrix @xmath41 to @xmath46 , here we consider the following approaches :    * qr decomposition : @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "* cholesky decomposition : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "+ we perform the process twice here since a single application may not yield an `` acceptable '' @xmath46 for some choices of @xmath64 .",
    "nevertheless , repeating the process a second time can be effectively considered as a qr decomposition with @xmath65 and @xmath66 and hence should work for generic values of @xmath64 . * continuous isospectral flow such as toda flow  @xcite .",
    "while any of these approaches will give us an isospectral transformation ( see e.g.  @xcite for details about the approaches using qr decomposition or cholesky decomposition ) , we will place special emphasis on continuous isospectral flow in this study . despite the generality that the continuous approach offers , there are also practical reasons for this choice : the first two transformation schemes are discrete in the sense that a family of isospectral systems is not evolved smoothly by varying a parameter in space . that is , though these schemes have been used for constructing isospectral or supersymmetric systems in the past @xcite , in mechanical settings , we observe that these approaches often result in systems with extremely high contrast ( variations ) in system parameters .",
    "this makes it very difficult to practically realize such systems .",
    "therefore , we adopt the continuous isospectral flow , in which we can control one ( or more ) parameter(s ) and generate the isospectral systems without incurring sharp contrasts in system parameters .",
    "this gives us extra degrees of freedom in terms of _ smoothly _ controlling the parameters of the resulting mechanical systems .",
    "let @xmath67 be the space of all @xmath47 , real , symmetric , tridiagonal matrices with negative subdiagonals and spectrum @xmath68 .",
    "since all eigenvalues in the spectrum are positive , all the matrices in this space are positive definite thus have positive main diagonals , i.e. , @xmath69 . on the other hand , it has been shown in  @xcite",
    "that the spectrum of a real , symmetric , tridiagonal matrix with negative subdiagonals must be simple ( this implies that any spring - mass system should have distinct eigenfrequencies ) thus @xmath70 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath67 is exactly the collection of matrices that bear the spectrum @xmath71 in @xmath54 . in the following lemma",
    ", we review the topology of @xmath67 described in  @xcite which naturally defines a continuous isospectral flow .",
    "[ lemma_continuous ] the space @xmath67 is diffeomorphic to @xmath72 , i.e. , there exists a bijective and smooth map @xmath73 .    for @xmath74 , there exists a unique @xmath75 such that @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "define @xmath81 , then it maps a matrix in @xmath67 to a point on the sphere @xmath82 .    on the other hand ,",
    "given a point @xmath83 on the sphere @xmath82 , we can find its corresponding matrix @xmath84 in the space @xmath67 . to be more specific ,",
    "suppose @xmath75 is an orthogonal matrix satisfying @xmath85 for @xmath80 and there exists some @xmath41 such that @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath86",
    ". then we have @xmath87 for @xmath80 and the orthogonality of columns of @xmath75 leads to the following equations : @xmath88 ^ 2 } , \\quad 1\\leq j\\leq n-1 \\\\ u_{i+1,j}&= & \\frac{1}{b_i } [ ( \\lambda_j - a_i)u_{ij}-b_{i-1}u_{i-1,j } ]   , \\quad 1\\leq j\\leq n-1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 for @xmath80 . by evaluating the equations in the order @xmath90 we can obtain a unique matrix @xmath84 .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath91 for @xmath92 thus such @xmath41 will always exist .",
    "by lemma  [ lemma_continuous ] , the matrices in @xmath67 are parametrized by the coordinates in @xmath82 thus every matrix in such a space will be accessible to us through its image point on the sphere .",
    "that is to say , by continuously moving the image point @xmath93 in @xmath82 we can accordingly obtain a continuous isospectral flow of matrices in @xmath67 by @xmath84 . also utilizing remark  [ remark_mass_spring_3 ]",
    ", we have shown that every spring - mass system will have a whole family of isospectral spring - mass systems with parameters @xmath94 .",
    "given a granular chain ( ns-1 ) whose linearized system is ( s-1 ) , we now consider constructing another granular chain ( ns-2 ) such that its linearized system ( s-2 ) has the same eigenfrequencies as those in ( s-1 ) . in general , this is a challenging task to achieve , because it is not always the case that a spring - mass system is the linearization of some granular chain ( although we have seen that the reverse is true ) and our isospectral transformations for spring - mass systems do not necessarily map a linearized granular chain to another linearized granular chain . to be more specific , a granular chain is determined by @xmath3 free variables @xmath7 while a spring - mass systems has @xmath95 free variables , namely @xmath8 and @xmath30 .",
    "since the symmetric tridiagonal matrices in the isospectral transformations have @xmath96 non - zero elements , only @xmath96 degrees of freedom in isospectral spring - mass systems can be kept , as also seen in remark  [ remark_mass_spring_3 ] .    to enable the construction of a granular chain from a tridiagonal matrix",
    ", we would like to extend our consideration to generalized forms of granular systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , motivated in part by the proposals of  @xcite , we attach a linear spring to each bead in the granular chain and let the other end of the spring be fixed .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , these linear springs are represented by cylindrical beams mounted on the ground , while the hertzian contacts among particles are denoted by inter - particle springs .",
    "we assume that the wall - mounted springs ( i.e. , cylindrical beams ) impose a potential to our system only in the longitudinal direction of the chain .",
    "if the stiffness of the @xmath20-th wall - mounted spring is @xmath97 , and @xmath97 is allowed to vary for @xmath98 , then the granular chain system now has @xmath96 degrees of freedom , and it matches the dimension of a @xmath47 symmetric tridiagonal matrix .",
    "note again that we only vary particles radii and wall - mounted stiffness values , while keeping the elastic modulus and density of beads ( i.e. , the material ) fixed .",
    "then , the new equations of motion become : @xmath99 and the linearized system around the steady - state solution is : @xmath100 where the mass matrix @xmath101 remains the same while the stiffness matrix @xmath102 has changed its diagonal entries to @xmath103 instead of @xmath104 for @xmath80 in @xmath105 .",
    "although the system in ( [ eqn1_ln_matrix ] ) is no longer identical to that in ( [ eqn0_ln_matrix ] ) ( i.e. , now the beads are wall - mounted ) , its associated matrix @xmath106 will again satisfy ( a1)(a3 ) , provided @xmath97 s are all nonnegative .",
    "then for a matrix @xmath107 in @xmath54 ( or @xmath67 ) , we seek a granular chain such that its linearization near the zero solution has @xmath107 as its associated matrix .",
    "this is possible because the radii and springs in the granular chain give @xmath96 unknowns ( note one of the springs , say the first one , is fixed ) , and the main diagonal and subdiagonals of @xmath107 also give @xmath96 equations .",
    "suppose a granular chain system ( ns-2 ) has radii @xmath108 , springs @xmath109 and precompressions @xmath110 .",
    "if ( ns-2 ) has a zero solution , then @xmath111 where @xmath112 represents the stiffness of elastic force between @xmath19-th and @xmath20-th beads .",
    "this is under the assumption that the mounted springs are unstretched at the initial compressive state of the chain . in the linearized system of ( ns-2 ) near the zero solution",

    "there exists a family of granular chains with the same eigenfrequencies in the linear limit as ( ns-1 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath136 obtained here will always be positive , however @xmath137 may contain negative components , which will violate the positivity of spring constants .",
    "that is to say , though we are in general free to vary @xmath138 to construct isospectral granular chains , perhaps only a part of the values for @xmath139 can lead to systems with positive @xmath137 such that they are physically realizable . in this work ,",
    "we have chosen our examples carefully so that they all have positive @xmath136 . however , it is certainly interesting to identify the precise conditions for positive @xmath136",

    "in this study , we explored the dynamics of granular chains that are isospectral in their linear limit .",
    "such systems have shown twofold advantages .",
    "first , we achieve considerable freedom in constructing isospectral systems by relying on lumped mass models .",
    "second , we can easily introduce nonlinearity in the system in order to study its effect ( such as frequency softening ) on the system dynamics .",
    "we discussed various spectral transformation schemes in this context , however , we found that the continuous transformation scheme ensures better control over system parameters as opposed to popular factorization techniques such as cholesky and qr decomposition used in supersymmetric frameworks .",
    "we enhanced this spectral transformational scheme by adding the functionality of adding / removing eigenfrequencies of choice .",
    "we showed that the entire framework thus allows us to tailor the spectrum details , and construct broad classes of isospectral physical systems , ranging from ordered to seemingly disoredered granular chains .    in terms of the dynamics",
    ", we observed that transmission gain is preserved under the spectral transformation scheme we used .",
    "for example , an ordered dimer granular chain showed similar transmission characteristics as that of a disordered granular chain isospectral to the former .",
    "this indicates new pathways of constructing disordered systems preserving bragg band - gaps , which are formed due to periodicity in the medium .",
    "as the strength of nonlinearity grows , either the amplitude of the solution increases or the precompression decreases , the linear spectrum will be distorted and isospectral systems can lead to quite different dynamics .",
    "however , the symmetry of being isospectral may still be of value for small amplitude excitations .    given the smooth transitions of the granular system s parameters calculated from the continuous isospectral flow method , we expect to realize the suggested isospectral systems via experimental approach . on the theoretical side , it is relevant to develop quantitative diagnostics for identifying how nonlinearity effects lead to a deviation from the identical spectra of linearly isospectral systems .",
    "furthermore , a deeper ( and more difficult ) question would be whether there exist some analogies or generalizations of these notions for genuinely nonlinear systems , perhaps borrowing ideas from the theory of inverse scattering transforms and associated lax pair problems .",

    "proof of remark [ remark_mass_spring_1 ] :      in order to prove the positive definiteness of @xmath41 , it suffices to show @xmath168 is positive definite .",
    "thanks to the explicit expression of @xmath105 , we observe that @xmath105 is a symmetric diagonally dominant real matrix with nonnegative diagonal entries , which implies that @xmath105 is positive semidefinite . on the other hand , it can be shown by induction that @xmath169 . as a result , @xmath105 is positive semidefinite and it does not have a zero eigenvalue thus it must be positive definite .",
    "for a spring - mass system with masses @xmath49 and spring constants @xmath50 , its stiffness matrix @xmath170 satisfies @xmath171 let @xmath172 and @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the mass matrix .",
    "if the spring - mass system has @xmath46 as its associated matrix , then @xmath175 and @xmath176 since @xmath46 is positive definite , there exists a unique @xmath177 for any @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath180 will be a positive vector as long as @xmath181 and @xmath182 are positive .",
    "then the masses and the spring constants of the system can be computed from @xmath183 and @xmath175 .    on the positivity of @xmath180 : since all off - diagonal entries of @xmath46 are negative and every eigenvalue of @xmath46 is positive , @xmath46 is an invertible m - matrix . by the properties of m - matrix , the entries of @xmath184 are all nonnegative .",
    "thus @xmath185 will always be a nonnegative vector .",
    "in fact , if both @xmath181 and @xmath182 are positive , we can show @xmath180 can not have any zero entry due to the fact that all off - diagonal entries of @xmath46 are negative . by contradiction , if @xmath186 for @xmath187 , then @xmath188 yields @xmath189 since @xmath180 is nonnegative and subdiagonals of @xmath46 are negative . if @xmath190 or @xmath191 , we have @xmath192 or @xmath193 , which is impossible .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of isospectral granular chains that are highly tunable due to the nonlinear hertz contact law interaction between the granular particles . </S>",
    "<S> the system dynamics can thus be tuned easily from being linear to strongly nonlinear by adjusting the initial compression applied to the chain . in particular , we introduce both discrete and continuous spectral transformation schemes to generate a family of granular chains that are isospectral in their linear limit . inspired by the principle of supersymmetry in quantum systems , we also introduce a methodology to add or remove certain eigenfrequencies , and we demonstrate numerically that the corresponding physical system can be constructed in the setting of one - dimensional granular crystals . in the linear regime , we highlight the commonalities and differences in the elastic wave transmission characteristics of such isospectral systems , and emphasize that the presented mathematical framework allows one to suitably tailor the wave transmission through a general class of granular chains . moreover , we show how the dynamic response of these structures deviates from its linear limit as we introduce hertzian nonlinearity in the chain and how nonlinearity breaks the notion of linear isospectrality . </S>"
