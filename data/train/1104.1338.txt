    "@xmath1 is proved to coincide with an indefinite intersection of numerical ranges of all the compressions of @xmath9 to @xmath21-dimensional subspaces , which has been also used in @xcite .",
    "further elaboration led us to reformulate @xmath1 in terms of an intersection of a countable family of numerical ranges .",
    "this result provides additional characterizations of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are presented in section 3 .",
    "initially , the higher rank numerical range @xmath1 is proved to be equal to an infinite intersection of numerical ranges .    [ th1 ]",
    "let @xmath22 .",

    "hence , we have @xmath44    at this point , we should note that theorem [ th1 ] provides a different and independent characterization of @xmath1 than the one given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "we focus on the expression of @xmath1 via the numerical ranges @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) , since it represents a more useful and advantageous procedure to determine and approximate the boundary of @xmath1 numerically .",
    "in addition , theorem [ th1 ] verifies the `` _ _ convexity of @xmath1 _ _ '' through the convexity of the numerical ranges @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) , which is ensured by the toeplitz - hausdorff theorem .",
    "a different way of indicating that @xmath1 is convex , is developed in @xcite . for @xmath47 , clearly @xmath48 and should be @xmath49 _ precisely _ when @xmath5 is scalar .    motivated by the above , we present the main result of our paper , redescribing the higher rank numerical range as _ a countable intersection of numerical ranges_.

    "this fact guarantees that any open cover of @xmath55^{c}$ ] admits a countable subcover , leading to the relation @xmath53^{c}=\\bigcup_{\\nu\\in\\mathbb{n}}[f(p_{\\nu}ap_{\\nu})^{c}],\\ ] ] i.e. leading to the first equality in .",
    "taking into consideration that there exists a countable dense subset @xmath56 with respect to the operator norm @xmath57 and @xmath58 , for @xmath59 , clearly , @xmath60 .",
    "that is in , the family of orthogonal projections @xmath61 can be chosen independently of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , due to @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , we derive the second equality in .    for a construction of a countable family of isometries @xmath51 ,",
    "see also in the appendix . +   + furthermore , using the dual `` max - min '' expression of the @xmath0-th eigenvalue , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 and due to the convexity of @xmath1 , we establish @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the convex hull of a set . apparently , @xmath69",

    "@xmath1 can not be described as a countable union in , because if @xmath74 then @xmath1 should be a countable set , which is not true .",
    "in this section , we characterize the @xmath0-rank numerical radius @xmath17 and the inner @xmath0-rank numerical radius @xmath18 . motivated by theorem [ th2 ] , we present the next two results .      by theorem [ th2 ] , we have @xmath78 for all @xmath59 , where the sequence @xmath79 is nonincreasing and @xmath80 is the circular disc centered at the origin with radius the spectral norm @xmath81 of @xmath9 .",
    "clearly , @xmath82 then the nonincreasing and bounded sequence @xmath83 converges . therefore @xmath84 we shall prove that the above inequality is actually an equality .",
    "assume that @xmath85 . in this case",
    ", there is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 for all @xmath59 .",
    "then we may find a sequence @xmath88 such that @xmath89 for all @xmath59 . due to the boundedness of the set @xmath90",
    ", the sequence @xmath91 contains a subsequence @xmath92 converging to @xmath93 and clearly , we obtain @xmath94 . because of the monotonicity of @xmath90 ( i.e. @xmath95 )",
    ", @xmath96 eventually belong to @xmath90 , @xmath97 , meaning that @xmath98 and since @xmath1 is closed , @xmath99 .",
    "it implies @xmath100 and then @xmath101 , a contradiction .",
    "obviously , @xmath102 indicates @xmath104 and by the relation , it is clear that @xmath105 consequently , the sequence @xmath106 , @xmath59 , is nondecreasing and bounded and we have @xmath107 in a similar way as in theorem [ th3 ] , we will show that @xmath108 .",

    "considering the sequence @xmath111 such that @xmath112 , let its subsequence @xmath113 converging to @xmath114 , with @xmath115 .",
    "since @xmath116 is nonincreasing , @xmath117 eventually belong to @xmath90 , @xmath118 , establishing @xmath119 .",
    "hence , we conclude @xmath120 , i.e. @xmath121 , absurd .          by theorem [ th2 ]",
    ", we obtain @xmath125 for all @xmath122 .",
    "then @xmath126 denoting by @xmath127 for all @xmath122 , we have @xmath128 since @xmath129 for any @xmath122 , immediately , we obtain @xmath130 if @xmath102 , then by theorem [ th2 ] , @xmath131 for some @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "hence @xmath135    the numerical radius function @xmath136 is not a matrix norm , nevertheless , it satisfies the power inequality @xmath137^{m}$ ] , for all positive integers @xmath138 , which is utilized for stability issues of several iterative methods @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath0-rank numerical radius fails to satisfy the power inequality , as the next counterexample reveals .",

    "using theorems [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] , the set @xmath140 is illustrated in the left part of figure [ fig1 ] by the uncovered area inside the figure .",
    "clearly , it is included in the unit circular disc , which indicates that @xmath141 .",
    "on the other hand , the set @xmath142 , illustrated in the right part of figure [ fig1 ] with the same manner , is not bounded by the unit circle and thus @xmath143 .",

    "it is worth noting that theorem 2.2 can be also generalized in the case of @xmath148 , which follows readily from the proof .",
    "hence , the rank-@xmath0 numerical radii of @xmath145 can be elaborated with the same spirit as here @xcite .        by theorem [ th1 ]",
    ", we have @xmath151 which is known to be a compact and convex subset of @xmath15 . for any @xmath149 isometry @xmath4 @xmath152",
    ", we have @xmath153 for all @xmath59 and thus , @xmath154 in order to prove equality in the relation , we distinguish two cases for the interior of @xmath1 .",
    "suppose first that @xmath155 . then by",
    ", we obtain @xmath156 and since @xmath157 is convex and closed , we establish @xmath158 where @xmath159 denotes the closure of a set . thus , combining the relations and , we have @xmath160 further , we claim that @xmath161 .",
    "assume on the contrary that @xmath162 but @xmath163 , then there exists an open neighborhood @xmath164 , with @xmath165 , such that @xmath166 then , the set @xmath55^{c}=\\mathbb{c}\\setminus\\lambda_{k}(a)$ ] is separable , as an open subset of the separable space @xmath15 and let @xmath167 be a countable dense subset of @xmath55^{c}$ ] @xcite .",
    "therefore , there exists a sequence @xmath168 in @xmath167 such that @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "moreover , @xmath171^{c}$ ] and by , it follows that for any @xmath172 correspond indices @xmath173 such that @xmath174 .",
    "thus @xmath175 , which is absurd , since @xmath176 .",
    "hence @xmath177 , verifying our claim and we obtain @xmath178 by , and , the required equality is asserted .",
    "consider now that @xmath1 has no interior points , namely , it is a line segment or a singleton . then there is a suitable affine subspace @xmath179 of @xmath15 such that @xmath180 and with respect to the subspace topology , we have @xmath155 and @xmath181 be separable . following the same arguments as above ,",
    "let @xmath182 be a countable dense subset of @xmath181 .",
    "hence , there is a sequence @xmath183 in @xmath182 converging to @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
