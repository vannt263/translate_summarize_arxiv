    "models for growing cells generally consist of substrates(@xmath0 ) and active proteins that catalyze their own synthesis and that of other components .",
    "for example , in the models developed by scott _",
    "et al._@xcite and maitra _",
    "et al._@xcite , the active proteins correspond to ribosomes .",
    "this class of models involving catalytic proteins can be used to accurately describe the exponential growth of a cell under a sufficient supply of substrates ; however , once the degradation rate of the active protein exceeds its rate of synthesis under a limited substrate supply , the cell s volume will shrink , leading to cell death .",
    "hence , a cell population either grows exponentially or dies out , and in this cellular state it is not possible to maintain the population without growth .",
    "+  to model a state with such suppressed growth , we consider two more chemical species , inhibitors(@xmath1 ) and active protein - inhibitor complexes(@xmath2 ) , in addition to the substrates(@xmath0 ) and active proteins(@xmath3 ) that are commonly adopted in models of cell growth . a schematic representation of the present model is shown in fig.[fig : fig1].(a ) . here",
    ", we focus on two classes of proteins that are essential to the description of cellular growth : an active protein and inhibitor .",
    "the active proteins are those that catalyze their own growth such as ribosomes , and can include metabolic enzymes , transporters , and growth - facilitating factors .",
    "inhibitory proteins form a complex with active proteins , thereby suppressing their catalytic synthesis function",
    ". they can be inhibitory factors such as yfia or hpf in _",
    "other candidates for such inhibitors are misfolded or mistranslated proteins that are produced erroneously during the replication of active proteins , which inhibit the catalytic activity of active proteins by trapping them into the aggregates of misfolded proteins @xcite . our model , then ,",
    "is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the synthesis rate of the active protein and inhibitor , to be presented below .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the reaction of complex formation , given by @xmath8 , @xmath9 represents the external concentration of substrate , @xmath10 denotes the spontaneous degradation rate of macromolecules @xmath11 , and @xmath12 represents the specific growth rate of the cell , given by @xmath13 .",
    "+  in this model , the cell takes up substrates from the external environment from which active proteins and inhibitors are synthesized .",
    "these syntheses @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , as well as the uptake of substrates , take place with the aid of catalysis by the active proteins . then , by assuming that the synthesized components are used for growth in a sufficiently rapid period , the growth rate is set to be proportional to the rate of active protein synthesis .",
    "next , the catalytic activity of the active protein is inactivated due to the formation of an active protein - inhibitor complex @xmath16 , which , for example , corresponds to the interaction between a ribosome and yfia and hpf @xcite .",
    "all chemical components are diluted by the volume growth of a cell , although they are spontaneously degraded at a much lower rate .",
    "the complex has higher stability than active protein and inhibitor , alone ( @xmath17 is smaller than @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "+  it has been well established that inhibitory factors are actively synthesized under a resource - limited condition @xcite . moreover , interpreting @xmath1 molecules as incorrect polymers , they are expected to increase with the decrease of supply substrates , since this situation will limit the proofreading mechanism to eliminate them@xcite .",
    "thus , with this interpretation of the inhibitors as incorrect polymers and also in consistency with increase in inhibitory factors under resource - limited condition , it naturally follows that the ratio of the synthesis of active protein to inhibitors is an increasing function of substrate concentration , i.e. , @xmath20 . in the model",
    ", we assume that this ratio increases with the concentration and becomes saturated at higher concentrations , as in michaelis - menenten s form , and choose @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for example .",
    "( see also the _ supplementary information _ for the derivation of such form in the case of a proofreading mechanism ) .",
    "+  note that by summing up @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we obtain @xmath25 if @xmath18 and @xmath17 are zero ( or negligible ) .",
    "it means that if the cell once reaches any steady state , the relationship @xmath26 is kept satisfied as long as @xmath3 and @xmath5 are not zero .",
    "we use the relationship and eliminate @xmath2 by substituting @xmath27 for analysis below .",
    "the steady state of the present model exhibits three distinct phases as a function of the external substrate concentration @xmath28 ( fig.[fig : fig1].(b ) ) , as computed by its steady - state solution .",
    "the three phases are distinguished by both the steady growth rate and the concentration of active protein , which are termed as the active , inactive , and death phases , as shown in the figure , whereas the growth rate shows a steep jump at the boundaries of the phases .",
    "the phases are characterized as follows . *",
    "( i ) * in the active phase , the highest growth rate is achieved , where abundant active proteins work freely as catalysts . *",
    "( ii ) * in the inactive phase , growth rate is not zero but is drastically reduced with orders of magnitude compared with the active phase . here ,",
    "almost all active proteins are arrested by complex formation with the inhibitor , and their catalytic activity is deactivated . *",
    "( iii ) * at the death phase , a cell can not grow , and all of the active proteins , inhibitors , and complexes go to zero . in this case",
    ", the cell goes beyond the so - called `` point of no return '' and can never grow again , regardless of the amount of increase in @xmath28 , since the catalysts are absent in any form .",
    "( as will be shown below , the active and inactive phases correspond to the classic log and stationary phases , but to emphasize the single - cell growth mode , we adopt these former terms for now ) . +  the transition from the active to inactive phase is caused by the interaction between the active protein and inhibitor . in the substrate - poor condition",
    ", the amount of inhibitor greatly exceeds the total amount of catalytic proteins ( @xmath29 ) , and any free active protein remaining vanishes . below the transition point from the inactive to death phase , the spontaneous degradation rate surpasses the synthesis rate , at which point all of the components decrease . this transition point",
    "is simply determined by the balance condition @xmath30 .",
    "hence , if @xmath18 is set to zero , the inactive - death transition does not occur .",
    "+  we now consider the time series of biomass ( the total amount of macromolecules ) that is almost proportional to the total cell number , under a condition with a given finite resource , for comparison with experimental data in the batch culture condition ( fig.[fig : fig1].(c and d ) ) . in the numerical simulation , the condition with a given",
    ", finite amount of substrates corresponding to the increase of cell number is implemented by introducing the dynamics of external substrate concentration to the original model . here",
    ", @xmath28 is decreased as the substrates are replaced by the biomass , resulting in cell growth ( details are given in the _ supplementary information _ ) . at the beginning of the simulation , the amount of biomass ( i.e. , cell number ) stays almost constant , and then gradually starts increases exponentially . after the phase of exponential growth , substrates are consumed , and the biomass increase stops . then , over a long time span , the biomass stays at a nearly constant value , until it begins to slowly decrease .",
    "finally , the degradation dominates and the biomass ( cell number ) falls off dramatically .",
    "+  these successive transitions in the growth of biomass ( fig.[fig : fig1](c and d ) ) from initially inactive to the active , inactive , and death phases corresponds to those among the lag , log , stationary , and death phases . as the initial condition was chosen as the inactive phase under a condition of rich substrate availability , most of the active proteins are arrested in a complex at this point .",
    "therefore , at the initial stage , dissociation of the complex into active proteins and inhibitors progress , and biomass is barely synthesized , even though rich substrate is available .",
    "after the cell escapes this waiting mode , catalytic reactions from active proteins progress , leading to an exponential increase in biomass .",
    "subsequently , the external substrate is depleted , and cells experience another transition from the active to inactive phase . at this point , the biomass decreases only slowly owing to the remaining substrate and stability of the active protein - inhibitor complex . however , after the substrate is depleted and the active protein and inhibitor are dissociated from the complex , the biomass decreases at a much faster rate , ultimately entering the death phase .",
    "+  in the active phase with exponential growth , the present model exhibits classical growth laws , namely * ( i ) * monod s growth law , * ( ii ) * pirt s law , and * ( iii ) * growth rate vs. ribosome fraction ( see _ supplementary information _ fig .",
    "in this section , we uncover the quantitative relationships among the basic quantities characterizing the transition between the active and inactive phases ; i.e. , lag time , starvation time , and growth rates .",
    "we demonstrate that the theoretical predictions agree well with experimentally observed relationships .",
    "+  first , we compute the dependency of lag time @xmath33 on starvation time @xmath34 and the maximum specific growth rate @xmath35 . up to time @xmath36 , the model cell is set in a substrate - rich condition @xmath37 , and stays at a steady state with exponential growth .",
    "then , the external substrate is depleted to @xmath38 instantaneously .",
    "the cell is exposed to this starvation condition up to starvation time @xmath39 .",
    "subsequently , the substrate concentration @xmath28 instantaneously returns to @xmath40 .",
    "after the substrate level is recovered , it takes a certain length of time for a cell to return to its original growth rate ( fig .",
    "s2 ) , which is the lag time @xmath41 ( following the standard definition of introduced by penfold and pirt@xcite ) . given this ,",
    "the dependency of @xmath41 on the starvation time @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be computed .",
    "+      we found that @xmath41 increases proportionately to @xmath45 , as shown in fig.[fig : fig2](a ) .",
    "the experimentally observed relationship between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is also plotted for comparison in fig.[fig : fig2](b ) , using reported data @xcite , which also exhibited @xmath46 dependency .",
    "although this empirical dependency has been previously discussed , its theoretical origin has thus far not been uncovered .",
    "+    indeed , the origin of @xmath47 is explained by noting the anomalous relaxation of inhibitor concentration , which is caused by the interaction between the active protein and inhibitor .",
    "the sketch of this explanation is given below , and the analytic derivation is given in the _",
    "supplementary information_. +  first , consider the time course of chemical concentrations during starvation . in this condition ,",
    "cell growth is inhibited by two factors : substrate depletion and deactivation of catalytic activity of the active protein . following the decrease in uptake due to depletion of @xmath28 , the concentration of @xmath0 decreases , resulting in a change in the balance between @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "( hereafter we adopt the notation such that @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 also denote the concentrations of corresponding chemicals ) . under the @xmath48 condition , the ratio of the synthesis of @xmath1 to @xmath3 increases . with an increase in @xmath1",
    ", @xmath3 decreases due to the formation of a complex with @xmath1 . over time , more @xmath3 gets arrested , and the level of inactivation increases with the duration of starvation .",
    "+  in this scenario , the increase of concentration @xmath1 is slow . considering that the complex formation reaction @xmath16 rapidly approaches its equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath49",
    ", @xmath3 is roughly proportional to the inverse of @xmath1 ( recall @xmath26 ) , if @xmath1 is sufficiently large .",
    "accordingly , the synthesis rate of @xmath1 , given by @xmath50 , is inversely proportional to its amount , i.e. , @xmath51 and thus @xmath52 hence , the inhibitor accumulation progresses with @xmath53 .",
    "( note that due to @xmath0 depletion , the dilution effect is negligible . ) +  next , we consider the time course for the resurrection after recovery of the external substrate . during resurrection , @xmath3 is increased while @xmath1 is reduced . since @xmath3 is strongly deactivated after starvation , the dilution effect from cell growth",
    "is the only factor contributing to the reduction of @xmath1 .",
    "noting @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the dilution effect is given by @xmath56 at the early stage of resurrection .",
    "thus , the resurrection time course of @xmath1 is determined by the dynamics @xmath57 leading to the linear decrease of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "+  let us briefly recapitulate the argument presented so far .",
    "the accumulated amount of component @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath45 , while during resurrection , the dilution of @xmath1 progresses linearly with time , which is required for the dissociation of @xmath3 and @xmath1 , leading to growth recovery . by combining these two estimates ,",
    "the lag time satisfies @xmath46 .",
    "second , the relationship @xmath60 is obtained by numerical simulation of our model , in line with experimental results @xcite ( fig.[fig : fig2](c and d ) ) .",
    "+  this relationship @xmath61 is also explained by the characteristics of the resurrection time course .",
    "the dilution rate of @xmath1 over time is given by @xmath62 , as mentioned above ; thus , at the early stage , @xmath63 .",
    "in the substrate - rich condition , the substrate abundances are assumed to be saturated , so that @xmath64 holds because @xmath65 is satisfied .",
    "thus , it follows that @xmath60 .",
    "+  we also obtained an analytic estimation of the lag time as @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( see _",
    "supplementary information _ for conditions and calculation ) . in this form",
    ", the two relationships @xmath68 and @xmath69 are integrated .",
    "+ the present theory also explains other experimental observations .",
    "first , in predictive microbiology@xcite , the lag time to return the log phase from the stationary phase is regarded as the time span required to consume the @xmath70 accumulated during the stationary phase with the rate @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the amount of @xmath70 is defined as the product of @xmath41 and @xmath43 . in our results ,",
    "accumulated inhibitor @xmath1 needs to be consumed during the lag time @xmath41 , so that @xmath70 is interpreted as @xmath1 , whose time course agrees well with that of @xmath70 obtained experimentally ( see supplementary figure fig.s4 ) .",
    "second , the tradeoff between the growth rate and tolerance for the starvation , experimentally observed @xcite is also derived from our theory ( see _ supplementary information _ ) .",
    "so far , we have considered the dependence of lag time on the starvation time . however",
    ", in addition to the starvation period , the starvation process itself , i.e. , the speed required to reduce the external substrate , has an influence on the lag time .",
    "+  for this investigation , instead of the instantaneous depletion of the external substrate , its concentration is instead gradually decreased over time in a linear manner over the span @xmath71 , in contrast to the previous simulation procedure , which corresponds to @xmath72 .",
    "then , the cell is placed under the substrate - poor condition for the duration @xmath42 , before the substrate is recovered , and the lag time @xmath41 is computed .",
    "+  the dependence of the lag time @xmath41 on @xmath42 and @xmath71 is shown in fig.[fig : fig3](a ) .",
    "while @xmath41 monotonically increases against @xmath42 for a given @xmath71 , it shows drastic dependence on @xmath71 .",
    "if the external concentration of the substrate is reduced quickly ( i.e. , small @xmath71 ) , the lag time is rather small .",
    "however , if the decrease in the external substrate concentration is slow ( i.e. , large @xmath71 ) , the lag time is much longer .",
    "in addition , this transition from a short to long lag time is quite steep .",
    "+    this transition against the timescale of the environmental change manifests itself in the time course of chemical concentrations ( see fig.[fig : fig3](b ) ) . with rapid environmental change",
    ", @xmath0 decreases first , whereas with slow environmental change , @xmath3 decreases first .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath1 is quite different between the two cases , indicating that the speed of environmental change affects the degree of inhibition , i.e. , the extent to which active proteins are arrested by inhibitors to form a complex . +  now , we provide an intuitive explanation for two distinct inhibition processes .",
    "when @xmath28 starts to decrease , a cell is in the active phase in which @xmath3 is abundant .",
    "if the environment changes sufficiently quickly , there is not enough time to synthesize the chemicals @xmath3 or @xmath1 , because of the lack of @xmath0 , and the concentrations of chemical species are frozen near the initial state with abundant @xmath3 . however ,",
    "if the environmental change is slower than the rate of the chemical reaction , the concentration of the inhibitor @xmath1 ( active protein @xmath3 ) increases ( decreases ) , respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath3 remains rich in the case of fast environmental change , whereas @xmath1 is rich for a slow environmental change . in the former case , when the substrate is increased again , the active proteins are ready to work , so that the lag time is short , which can be interpreted as a kind of `` freeze dry '' process .",
    "note that the difference in chemical concentration caused by different @xmath71 is maintained for log time because in slow ( fast ) environmental change , chemical reactions are almost halted due to the decrease of @xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) , respectively .",
    "thus , the difference of lag time remains even for large @xmath42 as fig.[fig : fig3](a ) ( the mechanism of this slow process is discussed in _ supplementary information_. ) .",
    "+  this lag time difference can also be explained from the perspective of dynamical systems@xcite . for a given @xmath0 , the temporal evolution of @xmath3 and @xmath1",
    "is given by the flow in the state space of @xmath73 .",
    "examples of the flow are given in fig.[fig : fig4 ] .",
    "the flow depicts @xmath74 , which determines the temporal evolution .",
    "the flow is characterized by @xmath75 and @xmath76 nullclines , which are given by the curves satisfying @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as plotted in fig.[fig : fig4 ]",
    ". +  note that at a nullcline , the temporal change of one state variable ( either @xmath3 or @xmath1 ) vanishes .",
    "thus , if two nullclines approach each other , then the time evolution of both the concentrations @xmath3 and @xmath1 are slowed down , and the point where two nullclines intersect corresponds to the steady state . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , nullclines come close together under the substrate - depleting condition , which gives a dynamical systems account of the slow process in the inactive phase discussed so far .",
    "+  for a fast change ( i.e. , small @xmath71 , fig.[fig : fig4](a ) ) , @xmath0 is quickly reduced at the point where the two nullclines come close together .",
    "then , the dynamics of @xmath73 follow the flow as shown in the figure .",
    "first , @xmath1 decreases to reach the @xmath1-nullcline .",
    "then , the state changes along the almost coalesced nullclines when the dynamics are slowed down .",
    "thus , it takes a long time to decrease the @xmath3 concentration , so that at resumption of the substrate , sufficient @xmath3 can be utilized .",
    "+  in contrast , for a slow change ( i.e. , large @xmath71 ) , the flow in @xmath73 gradually changes as shown in fig.[fig : fig4](b - d ) .",
    "initially , the state @xmath73 stays at the substrate - rich steady state ( fig.[fig : fig4](b ) ) . due to the change in substrate concentration , two nullclines moderately",
    "move and interchange their vertical locations .",
    "since the movement of nullclines is slow , the decrease in @xmath3 progresses before the two nullclines come close together ( i.e. , before the process is slowed down ) .",
    "the temporal evolution of @xmath3 and @xmath1 is slowed down only after this decrease in @xmath3(fig.[fig : fig4](c and d ) ) .",
    "hence , the difference between the cases with small and large @xmath71 is determined by whether the nullclines almost coalesce before or after the @xmath3 decrease , respectively .",
    "so far , we have considered the average change of chemical concentrations using the rate equation of chemical reactions .",
    "however , the biochemical reaction is inherently stochastic , and thus the lag time is accordingly distributed .",
    "this distribution was computed by carrying out a stochastic simulation of chemical kinetics using the gillespie algorithm@xcite .",
    "+  we found that the distribution of lag time @xmath41 has a standard gaussian form for the shorter lag - time side but has an @xmath79 tail for the longer side ( fig.[fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "this exponential tail was also observed in experiments , as overlaid in fig.[fig : fig5 ] , which is adapted from reisman _",
    "_ @xcite . in the present model ,",
    "once the number of active proteins becomes small , more time is needed to recover the growth , so that the distribution of initial active protein abundances is expanded to a long - tailed distribution .",
    "the agreement of the model with experimental data is relatively good for a short starvation time ( 24 hours and 48 hours ) but for longer times , the experimental data may suggest the existence of a much longer tail . +",
    "we developed a coarse - grained model consisting of a substrate , autocatalytic active protein , inhibitor of the active protein , and active protein - inhibitor complex . in the steady state ,",
    "the model shows distinct phases , i.e. , active , inactive , and death phases .",
    "in addition , the temporal evolution of total biomass shows bacterial growth curve - like behavior .",
    "the present model is not only consistent with the already - known growth laws in the active phase but also demonstrates two relationships , @xmath68 and @xmath60 , concerning the duration of the lag time @xmath41 .",
    "although these two relationships have also been observed experimentally , their origins and underlying mechanisms had not yet been elucidated .",
    "the present model can explain these relationships based on the formation of a complex between the active protein and inhibitor , whose increase in the starvation condition hinders the catalytic reaction .",
    "the inactive phase , which corresponds to the stationary phase , as well as the above two laws are generally derived as long as the ratio of the synthesis of the inhibitor to that of the active protein is increased along with a decrease in the external substrate concentration .",
    "this condition is also derived if the inhibitor is interpreted as a product of erroneous protein synthesis , where a proofreading mechanism to correct the error needing energy works inefficiently in a substrate - poor condition . +  although the cell state with exponential growth has been extensively analyzed in previous theoretical models , the transition to the phase with suppressed growth has thus far not been theoretically explained .",
    "our model , albeit simple , provides an essential mechanism for this transition as complex formation of active and inhibitor proteins , which can be experimentally tested .",
    "+  moreover , the model predicts that the lag time differs depending on the rate of external depletion of the substrate , which can also be examined experimentally .",
    "recently , the bimodal distribution of growth resumption time from the stationary phase was reported in a batch culture experiment@xcite .",
    "the heterogeneous depletion of a substrate due to the spatial structure of a bacterial colony is thought to be a potent cause of this bimodality , while understanding of this concept is fairly underway .",
    "since the present model shows different lag times for different rates of environmental change , it can provide a possible scenario for explaining this bimodality .",
