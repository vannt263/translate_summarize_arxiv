    "the cayley - dickson algebras @xmath1 ( complex numbers 2-d ) , @xmath2 ( quaternions 4-d ) , @xmath3 ( octonions 8-d ) , @xmath4 ( sedenions 16-d ) , and @xmath5 ( _ trigintaduonions _",
    "32-d ) ( from the latin word @xmath8 meaning 32 ) is also called the @xmath9-@xmath10 are real algebras obtained from the real numbers @xmath0 ( 1-d ) by a doubling procedure called the cayley - dickson ( c - d ) process [ 1 , 7 ] .",
    "thus we have the following c - d doubling chain :    @xmath0 * *  * * @xmath11 * *  * * @xmath1 * *  * * @xmath11 * *  * * @xmath2 * *  * * @xmath11 * *  * * @xmath3 * *  * * @xmath11 * *  * * @xmath4 * *  * * @xmath11 * *  * * @xmath5 * *  * * @xmath11 * *  * * ...    this shows that the trigintaduonions @xmath5 contains @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 as subalgebras . these , however , are not the only subalgebras of @xmath5 : any subalgebra of @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 is also a subalgebra of @xmath5 as well as others generated by its basis elements .    in a previous study",
    "[ 2 , 3 ] we determined ( using the software _ finitas _ [ 4 ] ) the _ basic subalgebra structure _ of the c - d sedenion algebra @xmath4 of dimension 16 .",
    "we showed that it contains an embedded loop @xmath12 of order 32 ( called the _ standard sedenion loop _ ) generated by its 16 basis elements .",
    "analysis of @xmath13 showed that it contains 15 maximal subloops of order 16 all of which are non - abelian nafils ( _ non - associative finite invertible loops _ ) [ 5 ] .",
    "of these , 8 are isomorphic to the standard _ octonion loop _",
    "@xmath14 of order 16 generated by the 8 basis elements of @xmath3 while 7 are isomorphic to a newly identified loop @xmath15 which we called the _ quasi - octonion loop .",
    "_ up to isomorphisms , _ _",
    "_ _ these subloops generate 8-dimensional subalgebras , @xmath3 and @xmath16 of the sedenions @xmath4 .",
    "the next c - d algebra in the chain after @xmath4 is the _ trigintaduonion _",
    "algebra @xmath5 of dimension @xmath17 the captivating thing about @xmath5 is that all of the well - known real division algebras @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 fit nicely inside it as subalgebras .",
    "hence any object involving these algebras can be dealt with in @xmath18 moreover , it also contains the sedenions @xmath4 and several sedenion - type algebras that have potential applications in pure mathematics and theoretical physics .",
    "this is our motivation for studying these algebras .",
    "the important question related to the study of any algebra is to know its subalgebra composition and lattice which determine its structure .",
    "this paper presents an attempt to determine the _ basic subalgebra structure _ of @xmath5 by determining the subloop composition and lattice of the loop @xmath6 of order @xmath19 generated by the @xmath20 basis elements of @xmath5 .",
    "the subloops of @xmath6 are of orders 32 , 16 , 8 , 4 , and 2 .",
    "these generate subalgebras of @xmath5 of dimensions 16 , 8 , 4 , 2 , and 1 , respectively .",
    "thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between the subloops of @xmath6 and the basic subalgebras of @xmath18 because of this the basic subalgebra composition of @xmath5 is directly related to that of @xmath21 to complete the description of the structure of @xmath6 we must show how its subloops fit inside it and how they are related to each other by determining its subloop lattice ; and hence , by the correspondence , also the basic subalgebra lattice of @xmath18      in the standard literature the term _ algebra _ [ 1 ] is taken to mean a finite dimensional vector space over a field _ f _ ( like @xmath0 ) with a bilinear multiplication ( not necessarily associative ) and with a unit element . being a vector space , we can choose a basis in terms of which each element of the algebra can be written as a linear combination of the basis elements .",
    "such an algebra is completely defined by the multiplication rules of its basis by means of a _",
    "multiplication table_. a _ loop _ [ 5 ] , on the other hand , is a binary system satisfying all group axioms but not necessarily the associative property . for finite loops of small order",
    ", multiplication is usually defined by a _ cayley table_.",
    "the cayley - dickson algebras [ 1 ] is a sequence of algebras over the real numbers @xmath22 each with twice the dimension of the previous one as indicated by the doubling chain in section 1 .",
    "thus , these algebras have dimensions of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an integer .",
    "any algebra in the chain contains all of the algebras ( and their subalgebras ) before it as subalgebras . for @xmath25",
    "such an algebra is _ not associative_.      in what follows , let the @xmath26 basis elements of the _ trigintaduonion algebra _",
    "@xmath5 be represented by the set @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the _ unit _ element . if @xmath29 then @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "because of this the set @xmath32 is not closed under the operation @xmath33 of trigintaduonion multiplication since it contains only positive elements .",
    "thus the 32 elements of @xmath32 must be extended to include 32 negative elements @xmath34 to form the _ trigintaduonion loop _",
    "@xmath6 of order @xmath35 .",
    "accordingly , these 64 loop elements will be represented by the set @xmath36 if @xmath37 then @xmath38 ( the _ unit _ ) while if @xmath39 then @xmath40 is an _ imaginary _ such that @xmath41 moreover , @xmath42      in this study we relied heavily on the use of the computer software _ finitas _ [ 4 ] , the loops package for gap [ 9 ] , and other programs for the construction and analysis of the various algebraic structures involved .    first ,",
    "the cayley table of the trigintaduonion loop @xmath6 was computer generated by means of a special computer program based on the cayley - dickson process .",
    "the result is shown in table 1 which only shows its main portion that corresponds to the multiplication table of the 32 basis elements of @xmath18    next , using the software _ finitas _ we determined the subloop composition of the trigintaduonion loop @xmath6 by generating the cayley tables of its subloops .",
    "we also analyzed @xmath6 to determine its basic structural properties ( section 3.5 ) .",
    "then we identified its subloops and classified them into isomorphy classes by subjecting them to isomorphism and other tests .",
    "for this , we used both finitas and loops ] .",
    "the data obtained from the various tests conducted were then analyzed .",
    "the trigintaduonion algebra @xmath5 contains an embedded loop @xmath6 of order 64 generated by its 32 basis elements .",
    "analysis ( using _ finitas _ ) shows that this loop is a nafil ( _ non - associative finite invertible loop _ ) with 373 non - trivial subloops of orders @xmath43 ( 31 loops ) , @xmath44 ( 155 loops ) , @xmath45 ( 155 loops ) , @xmath46 ( 31 loops ) , and @xmath47 ( 1 loop ) .",
    "the subloops of orders 32 and 16 are nafils while those of orders 8 , 4 , and 2 are groups .",
    "moreover , all of these 373 subloops of @xmath6 are _",
    "normal_. such a loop , called a _ hamiltonian _",
    "loop , is known to have a",
    "_ modular _ lattice [ 6 ] .",
