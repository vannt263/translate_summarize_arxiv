    "applications of all - optical signal processing as an alternative to electronic switching in telecommunication and computing networks drives continued interest in implementations of all - optical memory and optical logic @xcite .",
    "many approaches to these problems rely on the co - existence of lasing modes of a given system with injected optical pulses for switching between these states .",
    "proposed memories have been based on counter - propagating modes in micro - ring devices @xcite , polarization modes in vcsels @xcite , wavelength bistable states induced by gain cross - saturation @xcite and bistable states induced by spatial hole burning effect in dfb lasers @xcite .",
    "although switching performance in conventional edge - emitting diode lasers is constrained by speed limitations and power consumption , these devices represent testbeds for the study of the underlying dynamics based on generic systems of equations .",
    "dynamical behaviours found in conventional diode laser systems may be scalable to integrated devices based on photonic crystals or microcavities , thus overcoming limitations of speed and power consumption .",
    "a recent example of this correspondence is provided by a comparison of the structure of the injection locking bistability in a dual - mode diode laser and a compact photonic crystal microlaser system that supports two lasing modes @xcite . in both of these systems",
    "it was found that optical injection induced a bistability between the single mode injection - locked state and a dual - mode equilibrium state of the system .",
    "switching of the optical memory was then based on modulated optical injection .",
    "certain weaknesses of this proposal however included asymmetric states of the memory and the requirement for the optical injection itself , which played the role of an external holding beam . in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative but related system , which addresses many of the weaknesses of our earlier proposal .",
    "we consider wavelength bistability induced in a dual - mode diode laser by time - delayed optical feedback .",
    "we model this system using an extension of the equations describing the optically injected dual - mode system .",
    "this proposed memory element has many improved features when compared to devices based on injection - locking .",
    "these include improved speed , the absence of a holding beam and symmetry of the memory states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : equations_and_ecms ] we study the single - mode and dual - mode equilibria of the dual - mode system relating these results to the well - known theory of single - mode lasers . in section [ sec : bistability ] we show how bistability between single - mode equilibria appears in the dual - mode system for different external cavity lengths .",
    "we uncover the bifurcation structure underlying this bistability and derive analytical expressions for the boundaries of the bistable region . in section [ sec : bistable_regions ] we analyze the bistable regions varying different parameters of the system and we study the role of the gain saturation in the dual - mode system . in section [ sec : switching_dynamics ] we analyze the switching dynamics of the memory element and show how an optimal injected optical pulse duration is determined by the delay time of the system .",
    "our results indicate that by scaling the dual - mode device to microlaser dimensions , switching speeds in the ghz range can be achieved with femtojoule injected pulses .",
    "our theoretical study is based on a multimode extension of the lang - kobayashi equations @xcite : @xmath0 in the above equations , @xmath1 are the normalized complex electric fields associated with the two modes of the laser and @xmath2 is the normalized excess carrier density in the cavity .",
    "@xmath3 are the normalized complex fields delayed by the external cavity round trip time @xmath4 .",
    "the feedback strength is @xmath5 and @xmath6 is defined such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the free running lasing mode frequencies and @xmath11 . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the reference feedback phase and the feedback phase difference of the modes .",
    "the system is switched using optically injected pulses whose normalized complex fields are given by @xmath14 . here",
    "the detunings @xmath15 are measured from the free running lasing mode frequencies .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is the modal nonlinear gain function , where @xmath17 is the linear modal gain , @xmath18 is the gain self saturation and @xmath19 is the gain cross saturation . the phase - amplitude coupling is given by @xmath20",
    ", @xmath21 is the normalized pump current , while @xmath22 is the product of the cavity decay rate @xmath23 with the carrier lifetime @xmath24 .    equations ( [ eq : lk_rate_equations ] ) have validity within certain ranges of the external cavity length and of the feedback strength for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is that these equations take into account the propagation of the modal fields only in the external cavity and not in the laser cavity .",
    "hence , we assume here that the external cavity length needs to be at least one order of magnitude greater than the laser cavity length .",
    "the second reason is that equations ( [ eq : lk_rate_equations ] ) take into account only a single reflection on the external mirror .",
    "hence we assume that the feedback strength needs to be less than @xmath25 , as above this value multiple reflections in the external cavity should be taken into account .    for the parameters of the free running device we have used the following values : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( 35 @xmath29 above threshold ) , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these values allow for a stable dual - mode equilibrium state in the free running device .",
    "the same parameters were successfully used to model an optically injected dual - mode system where the primary modes had a frequency spacing of 480 ghz and the device length was 350 @xmath36 m @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ eq : lk_rate_equations ] ) allow for two different kinds of solutions : single - mode solutions and dual - mode solutions .",
    "the single - mode solutions of equations ( [ eq : lk_rate_equations ] ) are the external cavity modes ( ecms ) of the system @xcite .",
    "these ecms are obtained assuming the ansatz @xmath37 $ ] in equations ( [ eq : lk_rate_equations ] ) and zero intensity individually for each modal field .",
    "these solutions can be regarded as `` equilibrium states '' when considering that their amplitudes and frequencies are constant in time . in this paper",
    ", we refer to these oscillatory solutions as `` equilibrium states '' in this sense .",
    "the single - mode ecms of the dual - mode system are described by the following equations : @xmath38 \\\\ % carrier density & & n^{\\mbox{\\tiny sm } } = ( \\epsilon p   - 2 \\eta \\cos ( z_m ) ) / ( 2 + \\epsilon ) .",

    "each ecm of the system is associated with a unique value of the detuning , which can vary from a few gigahertz to tens of gigahertz .",
    "the linear stability analysis of the single - mode ecms of equations ( [ eq : single_mode_equilibrium_feedback ] ) within the single - mode sub - manifolds of the dual - mode system demonstrates that the single mode ecms are born in pairs with a stable ecm and an unstable ecm generated through saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "this analysis leads to the following condition for the stability of the single - mode ecms @xcite : @xmath42 when the above condition is satisfied the single - mode ecms are stable within the single - mode sub - manifolds of the dual - mode system with respect to the saddle - node bifurcation , while these ecms are unstable when this condition is greater than zero . using equations ( [ eq : single_mode_equilibrium_feedback ] ) we can study the evolution of the single - mode ecms while varying the feedback strength , as shown in figure [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( a ) , [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( b ) and [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( c ) .",
    "here we have considered an external cavity length of 1 cm and a laser cavity length of the order of few hundred micrometres .",
    "because of the large primary mode spacing , @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be considered free parameters that can be tuned through a relatively small displacement of the external mirror .",
    "we have chosen the values @xmath43 and @xmath44 for obtaining the maximum switching speed of the considered device .    in figure",
    "[ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( a ) and [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( b ) we plot the single - mode ecm intensity , while in figure [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( c ) we plot the single - mode ecm normalized carrier - density . in these figures",
    "solid and dashed lines denote respectively stable and unstable ecms in the single - mode sub - manifolds of the dual - mode system .",
    "the stability of these ecms is obtained using equation ( [ eq : saddle_node_condition ] ) .",
    "one can also see the presence of saddle - node bifurcations where stable and unstable branches collide .",
    "a fundamental feature of the dual - mode system we consider is the existence of dual - mode solutions , which are derived from equations ( [ eq : lk_rate_equations ] ) , assuming the ansatz @xmath45 $ ] and non - zero intensity for both modal fields .",
    "these solutions are given by the following equations : @xmath46[\\epsilon(1-\\beta^2)]^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\ % carrier density & & n^{\\mbox{\\tiny tm } } = \\frac{\\epsilon ( 1-\\beta^2 ) p - ( \\beta-1)(x_1+x_2 ) -2 + \\beta(x_1 x_2^{-1 }   + x_2 x_1^{-1 } ) } { \\epsilon ( 1 - \\beta^2 ) + 4 -2 \\beta(x_1 x_2^{-1 } + x_2 x_1^{-1 } ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath47 , plus and minus signs refer respectively to mode 1 and mode 2 .",
    "dual - mode equilibrium solutions involve two independent detunings which are equal to the values determined by the single - mode ecms .",
    "they can therefore be regarded as ecm pairs obtained from nonlinear combinations of the single - mode solutions . because the dual - mode solutions are defined with a single common carrier density , they in general involve a redistribution of the intensity from the single - mode values .",
    "we have used equations ( [ eq : two_mode_equilibrium_feedback ] ) for plotting the intensities and the carrier density of the dual - mode solutions in figure [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( d ) , [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( e ) and [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( f ) as a function of feedback strength with the same parameters as in figure [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] ( a ) - ( c ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] there are regions where the dual - mode solutions are unphysical with negative value of one of the modal intensities .",
    "one can also see that for each saddle - node of the single - mode ecms a corresponding saddle - node of dual - mode solutions occurs .",
    "furthermore for vanishing feedback strength only a single dual - mode solution exists , which corresponds to the stable free running dual - mode equilibrium perturbed by the feedback .",
    "this can be seen in the inset of figure [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] , where the intensities of the two modes converge towards the free running dual - mode equilibrium .",
    "in the dual - mode system described by equations ( [ eq : lk_rate_equations ] ) bistability between single - mode ecms can be observed .",
    "this is shown in the bifurcation diagrams of the modal intensities in figure [ fig : bifurcation_diagrams ] ( a ) and [ fig : bifurcation_diagrams ] ( b ) . here",
    "the feedback parameters are the same as in figure [ fig : equilibria_1 cm ] . in these figures",
    "one can see that , as the feedback strength is increased from zero , the system evolves into a stable single - mode ecm of mode 2 , followed by a hopf bifurcation and a region of coupled complex dynamics . for a further increase of the feedback strength",
    "a single - mode ecm of mode 2 is the only stable state until a pair of single - mode ecms of mode 1 are generated through a saddle - node bifurcation , labelled sn1 . at this saddle - node bifurcation a region of bistability",
    "appears where the unique single - mode ecm of mode 2 and the single - mode ecm of mode 1 associated with the stable branch of the saddle - node bifurcation sn1 co - exist .",
    "this bistable region is bounded when the single - mode ecm of mode 2 loses stability at a point which we label @xmath48 . following this , the single - mode ecm of mode 1 is the only stable state of the system . for a further increase of the feedback strength we found a stable dual - mode equilibrium followed by a stable single - mode ecm of mode 2 .    .",
    "the label sn1 indicates a saddle - node bifurcation for mode 1 .",
    "the label @xmath49 indicates a transcritical bifurcation between a single - mode ecm of mode 2 associated with the free running solution and a dual - mode equilibrium .",

    "this leads to an increase of the current threshold density @xmath50 by a factor of three .",
    "we also choose a pump current five times greater than the current threshold , which leads to an increase of the relaxation oscillation frequency @xmath51 and of the damping factor @xmath52 of the free running device . the increased relaxation oscillation frequency and damping can lead to faster switching transients for the memory .",
    "in order to understand the bifurcation at the upper boundary of the bistable region , in figure [ fig : steady_states_with_transverse_stability_1 cm ] we have plotted the intensity of the single - mode ecms of interest for a device with 1 cm external cavity length .",
    "one can see the branches of single mode ecms of mode 1 , which appear at the saddle - node bifurcation sn1 .",
    "in the upper inset of figure [ fig : steady_states_with_transverse_stability_1 cm ] we plot the modal intensities of a dual - mode solution of the system in a range close to the bifurcation @xmath49 .",
    "as indicated by the filled circles in figure [ fig : steady_states_with_transverse_stability_1 cm ] , this dual - mode solution is derived from the single - mode ecm of mode 1 associated with the unstable branch of the bifurcation sn1 and from the single - mode ecm of mode 2 associated with the free running solution .",
    "the modal intensities of these single - mode ecms have been plotted in the lower inset of figure [ fig : steady_states_with_transverse_stability_1 cm ] .",
    "from the two insets we can see that the upper boundary of the bistable region is found where one of the fields associated with the dual - mode solution becomes equal to zero .",
    "the upper boundary of the bistable region is then understood as resulting from a collision between a stable single - mode ecm of mode 2 with an unstable dual - mode solution .",
    "these solutions exchange their stability in a transcritical bifurcation @xmath49 with the dual - mode solution becoming unphysical with a negative value for the intensity of mode 1 after the bifurcation .",

    ", stability requires that eigenvalues of the zero field part of the single - mode solutions are transversally stable with respect to the carrier density value given by equation ( [ eq : single_mode_equilibrium_feedback ] ) .",

    "the main effect of the introduction of a non - zero gain saturation parameter is that the four bistable regions become non - adjacent .",
    "this separation of the bistable regions is due to the absence of the degeneracy between the bifurcations @xmath79 and @xmath80 and between @xmath81 and @xmath48 . in order to understand the physical mechanism that governs the degeneracy of these bifurcations we study the dual - mode equilibrium of equations ( [ eq : lk_rate_equations ] ) for @xmath65 , which can be written as follows : @xmath82 equations ( [ eq : two_mode_equilibrium_feedback_zero_epsilon ] )",
    "define a unique value of the excess carrier density and a unique value of the sum of the modal intensities , but do not uniquely define the two individual modal intensities .",
    "this means that these equations are solved by a continuous set of values of the modal intensities .",
    "therefore equations ( [ eq : two_mode_equilibrium_feedback_zero_epsilon ] ) define an invariant set of points in the phase space of the dual - mode system . we note also that the two conditions that define the dual - mode carrier density in equations ( [ eq : two_mode_equilibrium_feedback_zero_epsilon ] ) coincide with the expressions for the single - mode carrier densities in equations ( [ eq : single_mode_equilibrium_feedback ] ) for @xmath65 .",
    "physically , this means that for @xmath65 the dual - mode equilibrium states exist only when the excess carrier densities associated with the single - mode equilibria are degenerate .",
    "thus the invariant set of dual - mode equilibrium states exist at isolated points where they enable the transcritical bifurcations at the boundaries of the bistable regions .",

    "we have found that although the bistable region remains open for vanishing delay time , the feedback strength required to observe the bistability diverges in this limit .",

    "we have defined this minimum pulse energy by requiring that the switching transients be strongly damped before the arrival of the next switching pulse . for pulse durations larger than the delay time , we observe that the energy required for switching the system decreases linearly as the pulse duration is decreased .",
    "the minimum pulse energy in each case corresponds to a pulse duration close to but greater than the delay time .",
    "this result can be understood when we consider that the switching pulse is injected in a mode of the system which has zero field amplitude .",

    "switching frequencies of at least 500 mhz with 100 ps pulses should be possible .",
    "this would represent a significant improvement on the performance of a memory element based on the injection locking bistability in a conventional device .",
    "we also considered the limit of a very short external cavity length equal to 1 mm , which may be appropriate for certain photonic crystal microlaser structures . in this case",

    "<S> a proposal for an all - optical memory based on a bistability of single - mode states in a dual - mode diode laser with time - delayed optical feedback is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the system is modeled using a multimode extension of the lang - kobayashi equations with injected optical pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we uncover the bifurcation structure by deriving analytical expressions for the boundaries of the bistable region and demonstrate how the delay time in the external cavity determines an optimal pulse duration for efficient switching of the memory element . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the relevant role played by gain saturation and by the dual - mode solutions of the lang - kobayashi equations for the existence of the bistable regions . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that feedback induced bistability can lead to significant performance improvements when compared to memory elements based on the injection locking bistability in dual - mode devices . </S>"
