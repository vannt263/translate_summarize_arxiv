    "the study of isotopic @xmath2he-@xmath0he mixed clusters is attracting a growing interest in recent years . from the experimental viewpoint ,",
    "the diffraction of clusters from a transmission grating  @xcite has opened new perspectives in the detection and identification of small clusters .",
    "there is no evidence for the existence of the dimer @xmath2he@xmath0he , but clusters @xmath2he@xmath3@xmath0he with @xmath4 have been definitely detected  @xcite .",
    "it seems possible at present to resolve clearly the clusters of mass up to about 25 amu  @xcite .",
    "as the weakly van der waals he - he interaction is isotope independent , the properties of such mixed clusters are determined solely by quantal effects , namely the different zero - point motion and the different statistics of the two isotopes .",
    "it turns out that helium clusters are weakly bound systems , and the lighter ones are challenging for microscopic theoretical methods .    the stability of small mixed clusters has been the object of several recent microscopic studies .",
    "guardiola and navarro have investigated clusters containing up to eight @xmath2he atoms and up to 20 @xmath0he atoms , based on both a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) wave function  @xcite and the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method  @xcite in the fixed - node approximation .",
    "bressanini and collaborators  @xcite have considered clusters with up to 17 @xmath2he and up to three @xmath0he atoms , by means of the dmc method , also in the fixed node approximation .    the dmc description is based in an importance sampling wave function which plays a triple role : it controls the variance of the ground - state energy , it carries on the quantum numbers and other properties of the considered cluster , and it specifies the nodal ( or set of nodal ) surfaces . in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite the antisymmetry required for fermions has been taken into account by means of two slater determinants , one for each spin orientation , which have been built up in terms of harmonic polynomials in the cartesian coordinates of each fermion . moreover , a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) ordering of the fermionic shells has been assumed .",
    "although this seems a reasonable hypothesis , supported by the findings of density - functional calculations in medium sized mixed droplets  @xcite , from a microscopic point of view there are no conclusive _ a priori _ arguments in favor of such an ordering .",
    "for instance , to describe mixed systems with three @xmath0he atoms , a configuration with total angular momentum @xmath5 has been assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to the filling of the single - particle levels @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath7 ho ordering , which has been assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite , results in an angular momentum @xmath8 .",
    "the comparison of respective binding energies indicates that the @xmath8 state has a lower energy than the @xmath5 one . in conclusion ,",
    "a more general criterion to select the shell ordering needs to be specified .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the excitation spectrum of a single @xmath0he atom bound to a @xmath2he@xmath3 cluster .",
    "the ordering of these single - particle levels will be relevant to describe mixed clusters with a higher number of @xmath0he atoms .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the knowledge of the one - fermion spectra in terms of the number of bosons is also relevant to determine the constants entering the rate equations which establish the formation chemical process @xcite , and thus the abundances in the production experiments .",
    "our calculations are based in the dmc method , using an importance sampling wave function which carries out the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath0he relative to the @xmath2he@xmath3 cluster .",
    "the dmc procedure is thus adapted so as to determine the lowest energy state of the subspace of orbital angular momentum @xmath9 . in order to obtain the excited states within each subspace of angular momentum",
    "@xmath9 we use an optimized form of the upper bounds provided by the sum rules method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review previous investigations of @xmath2he@xmath3@xmath0he clusters . in section",
    "iii we present a detailed description of the method used to study the ground and excited states of these clusters .",
    "our results are presented and discussed in section iv .",
    "some final comments are given in section v.",
    "a pure @xmath2he@xmath10 cluster is described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of @xmath2he , and @xmath13 is the interaction potential .",
    "recent forms  @xcite of this interaction are quite similar and we will use along the paper the one known as hfd - b  @xcite potential .    given that the he - he interaction is a consequence of the interaction between the electrons in the atoms , it is independent of the mass or the spin of the nucleus .",
    "to convert the @xmath14-th atom into an @xmath0he atom , thus dealing with the cluster @xmath2he@xmath15he , corresponds to a simple change in the hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of @xmath0he .",
    "the corresponding many - body problem is then not much different from that of a pure @xmath2he cluster . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will use the subindex @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 , to alleviate the notation .",
    "mixed @xmath2he@xmath3@xmath0he clusters containing a single fermion have been investigated using several theoretical methods .",
    "the first systematic study of the excitation spectrum of the @xmath0he atom was made by dalfovo  @xcite , based on a zero - range density functional .",
    "the use of a non - local finite - range density functional  @xcite results in small quantitative differences , related to the fact that finite - range functionals are more repulsive than zero - range ones . as the size on the drop increases ,",
    "the @xmath0he atom is pushed to the surface region , due to its large zero - point motion , and for large enough clusters , the centrifugal term @xmath20 entering the schrdinger equation for the @xmath0he atom can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "actually  @xcite , the general trend of the spectrum is a series of tight rotational bands on top of radial excitations , related to the number of nodes in the radial wave function . in the limit of very large @xmath1 ,",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath0he atom becomes independent of the quantum angular momentum , forming the analogous of the two - dimensional andreev states in bulk helium .",
    "the so - called lekner approximation was used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a vmc calculation was performed , as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the hypernetted - chain method in its optimized version .",
    "such approximation , used by lekner  @xcite to analyze the andreev states in bulk liquid , assumes that the pair correlations between @xmath0he and @xmath2he atoms are the same as those between pairs of @xmath2he atoms , so that the cluster @xmath2he@xmath3@xmath0he can be considered as a perturbation of the cluster @xmath2he@xmath10 , the perturbation being given by @xmath21 further elaboration of the perturbation scheme results in a single - particle schrdinger equation describing the @xmath0he atom with an effective potential given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the @xmath2he particle and kinetic energy densities , both defined in the unperturbed system with @xmath19 bosons .",
    "notice that the laplacian operator acting on the square root of @xmath25 produces a strongly attractive force peaked at the surface of the cluster .    in order to classify the resulting spectra , krotscheck and zillich  @xcite defined an effective wave number @xmath26 for each excitation characterized by the orbital angular momentum @xmath9 , where @xmath27 is the equivalent hard sphere radius @xmath28 , defined in terms of the root mean square radius @xmath29 of the droplet . by plotting all excitation energies as a function of @xmath30 for a large number of clusters , krotscheck and zillich found that all results fall reasonably well on a universal quadratic line , in nice agreement with the density - functional results .",
    "both sets of results may be approximately pictured as molecular rigid rotor , in which the @xmath2he@xmath15he cluster is viewed as a two body system , the cluster formed by the @xmath1 bosons plus the single fermion , tied by a spring with a rather large rigidity constant .",
    "various angular momentum @xmath9 states are associated to each vibrational - like state of the spring , obeying the law @xmath31 this equation defines the rotational constant @xmath32 ( units of energy ) in terms of the momentum of inertia @xmath33 , the later being proportional to @xmath34 , where @xmath27 is the average distance of the fermion to the center - of - mass of the bosonic cluster .    in the case of light clusters ( @xmath35 ) the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite find appreciable deviations from the universal behavior eq .",
    "( [ constants ] ) .",
    "small @xmath2he@xmath3@xmath0he clusters have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the dmc method , and in refs .",
    "@xcite without the use of the lekner approximation . to this respect",
    "it is worth stressing that the lekner approximation is basically a _ weak coupling _",
    "description of the interaction of a @xmath0he atom with a @xmath2he cluster , because it does not include the perturbation that the outer @xmath0he atom should generate on the binding cluster .",
    "one may expect this picture to be satisfactory for large bosonic clusters , but inappropriate for small @xmath1 . as a consequence ,",
    "the interesting area to explore corresponds to the case of a small @xmath2he cluster , which may be appreciably modified by the @xmath0he atom .",
    "to carry out the diffusion monte carlo calculation requires an importance sampling or guiding wave function , which incorporates as much as possible the characteristics of the system to be described .",
    "in particular , due to the strong short - range repulsion of the atom - atom interaction , it is advisable to introduce at least two - body jastrow correlations . moreover , the guiding wave function must confine the system and , finally , it has to include the bosonic symmetry related to the @xmath2he atoms and the desired quantum numbers for the @xmath0he atom . in this section",
    "we shall describe a variational wave function which will be used to calculate the lowest - energy states for a given value of the angular momentum @xmath9 of the system .",
    "excited states corresponding to radial excitations will be estimated by means of sume - rule techniques .      in order to describe the system @xmath2he@xmath3@xmath0he in a state where the @xmath0he atom is in an orbital angular momentum @xmath9 with respect to the @xmath2he@xmath3 system ,",
    "a simple but nevertheless complete wave function is given by @xmath36 where the subindexes @xmath37 and @xmath18 stand for bosons and fermions , respectively , whereas @xmath38 refers to the mixed boson - fermion part of the wave function .",
    "the bosonic coordinates run from 1 to @xmath1 and the coordinate of the fermion is labelled by @xmath18 .",
    "finally , @xmath39 represents the center - of - mass coordinate of the bosonic subsystem .",
    "this model wave function includes an internal bosonic part ( @xmath40 ) and the coupling of the fermion to individual bosons ( @xmath41 ) as well as to the bosonic cluster ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath40 and @xmath41 to be of the jastrow form @xmath43 with @xmath44 the two - body correlation terms include a short - range part , associated with the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and a long - range confining part associated with the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the short - range part is mainly related to the small - distance behavior of the relative two - body wave function .",
    "consequently , the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 have been taken to be the same for all systems studied , and in our calculations they have been kept fixed to the values @xmath51   , @xmath52     and @xmath53 , as obtained in our previous calculations for pure @xmath2he and @xmath0he clusters  @xcite , by direct minimization of the expectation value of the energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the long - range confining parameters @xmath54 have been determined by means of the vmc method .    in the absence of the last term @xmath42 of the importance sampling wave function ( [ importance_sampling ] ) we would describe a state of null angular momentum , explicitly translational invariant and including the bosonic symmetry of the indistinguishable @xmath2he atoms .",
    "the role of the last term @xmath42 of eq .",
    "( [ importance_sampling ] ) , describing the motion of the fermion , is to determine the value of the orbital angular momentum @xmath9 .",
    "it has been taken as a long - range wave function depending on the relative coordinate of the fermion with respect to the center - of - mass of the bosons , @xmath55 .",
    "the explicit form used is the harmonic polynomial @xmath56 this function is particularly simple and corresponds to a state with orbital angular momentum @xmath9 and null third component .",
    "one could have taken a more sophisticated form , by putting a radial dependence different from the simple @xmath57 , but it is reasonable to expect the dmc algorithm to be able to improve this simple and computationally convenient form . by making this part of the trial wave function to depend on the relative distance of the fermion to the center - of - mass of the bosons the translational invariance of the importance sampling wave function is not spoiled .",
    "notice that if we had considered the function to depend on the distance of the fermion to the center - of - mass of the full system , the only difference would have been a trivial scale factor .    with the structure of the importance sampling wave functions",
    "one may describe the lowest - energy states for each angular momentum @xmath9 .",
    "it should be mentioned that apart from the case @xmath5 for which @xmath58 , all other cases correspond to functions with a nodal surface , with nodes depending only on the angular variables .",
    "this fact has to be taken into account when using the dmc algorithm .",
    "when considering a subspace of angular momentum @xmath9 the dmc algorithm gives only the energy of the ground state of that subspace , and there is no information about the excited states of the same angular momentum .",
    "a way to have an estimate , actually an upper bound , of the first excited state is to use the sum rules method  @xcite .",
    "consider the exact ground state for a given angular momentum @xmath9 , represented here by @xmath59 , and the full set of eigenstates of this subspace ordered by increasing energy and represented by @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 be an arbitrary hermitian operator which may depend on all atomic coordinates , which is assumed to be scalar under rotations , i.e. , to commute with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "let us consider the sum rule of order @xmath64 @xmath65 = \\sum_{(n,\\ell)\\neq ( 0,l ) } ( e_{n\\ell } - e_{0l})^p   |\\langle\\psi_{n\\ell}|q|\\psi_{0l}\\rangle|^2 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the sum extends to all eigenstates of the hamiltonian but the lowest energy state of angular momentum @xmath9 .",
    "this is important because in order to obtain easily computable properties it will convenient to use the completeness relation .",
    "because of the assumed properties of @xmath66 only states with angular momentum @xmath67 will contribute to the sum .",
    "the @xmath68 rule fulfills the property @xmath69 & \\equiv & \\sum_{n\\neq 0 } ( e_{nl}-e_{0l } ) |\\langle\\psi_{nl}|q|\\psi_{0l}\\rangle|^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\geq & ( e_{1l}-e_{0l } ) m_l^{(0)}[q ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which one obtains an upper bound to the energy of the first excited state of the subspace @xmath9 @xmath70}{m_l^{(0)}[q ] } \\ , .\\ ] ]    the evaluation of the sum rules is simpler than seem , because of the relations @xmath71 & = & \\langle\\psi_{0l } |   q^2   | \\psi_{0l } \\rangle - |\\langle\\psi_{0l } |   q   | \\psi_{0l } \\rangle |^2 \\\\ \\label{eme1 } m_l^{(1)}[q ] & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\langle\\psi_{0l } |   [ q,[h , q ] ] | \\psi_{0l } \\rangle   \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the double commutator may be simplified for a general hamiltonian of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ he3 ] ) , obtaining @xmath72 note that to compute these expressions one only requires knowledge of the ground state wave function of the angular momentum @xmath9 subspace .",
    "this method was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain upper bounds to the first @xmath5 excitation , as well as to the low - lying even - l states .",
    "given that we are obtaining the @xmath73 excitations directly from the dmc procedure , the sum rules method will be used here to obtain the energies of the first excited states in each @xmath9-subspace . in the appendix we use the sum rule method to also estimate @xmath73 excitations based in the knowledge of @xmath74 by relaxing the scalar character of @xmath66 as an alternative to the direct dmc calculations .    the upper bound given by eq .",
    "( [ upper_bound ] ) is a functional of the operator @xmath66 , so it may be variationally optimized by equating to zero its functional derivative with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "unrestricted minimization will give rise to the unpractical relation @xmath75 , its solution being equivalent to the solution of the many - body schrdinger equation for the excited state .",
    "an alternative is to optimize the operator inside a restricted subspace , which is the approach followed by chin and krotscheck  @xcite and is closely related to the procedure of krisna and whaley  @xcite .",
    "here we have followed a simpler procedure , based in the linear expansion of the operator in a basis of easily computable operators .",
    "to determine the basis we have assumed a single - particle - like form for the operator , by considering that it depends only on @xmath76 , i.e. , on the coordinate of the fermion referred to the bosonic center - of - mass @xmath77 this simple form preserves the translational invariance and does not spoil the boson symmetry of the @xmath2he subsystem . for this type of general operator eq .",
    "( [ simple_m1 ] ) can be further simplified , since the following relation @xmath78 holds .",
    "the resulting sum rule @xmath79 becomes @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the reduced mass of the @xmath0he atom and the @xmath2he cluster .    in the calculations to be described below the monopole operator",

    "( [ upper_bound ] ) may be lost .    some insight on the structure of these excitation",
    "may be drawn by considering the leading @xmath91 terms of both the hamiltonian and norm matrices .",
    "for this one - dimensional subspace the upper bound to the radial excitation energy is given by @xmath92 the size of this bound depends on the difference between the mean square radius and the squared mean radius of the fermion with respect to the boson center - of - mass .",
    "this difference will be small if the distribution of the fermion with respect to the boson center - of - mass is sharply peaked near a given value say @xmath93 , corresponding to a rather rigid spring .",
    "then the denominator will be small and the radial excitation will have large energy .",
    "the excited states considered in this section result from excitations related to the distance between the fermion and the center - of - mass of the cluster of bosons .",
    "the underlying optimal wave function ( not determined , however , from the dmc procedure ) should have at least a node along this radial coordinate , in order to be orthogonal to the angular momentum @xmath9 ground state , and may be properly termed as a _",
    "radial excitation_.      the dmc algorithm  @xcite is nowadays a well - known and used technology .",
    "it is based in integrating the imaginary - time schrdinger equation for an auxiliary function @xmath94 which is the product of a trial wave function @xmath95 and the true ground - state wave function @xmath96 .",
    "the solution is given in terms of an approximate small - time green funtion @xmath97 @xmath98 by means of a series of small time steps @xmath99 .",
    "we have used the @xmath100 approximate green function  @xcite which provides an @xmath101 approximation for the energy . in our calculations",
    "we have used a set of 1000 walkers , on the average , a value of @xmath102 , 8000 iterations to settle down the system and 80000 iterations to compute the averages .",
    "for @xmath103 we have used a smaller time step @xmath104 and the number of iterations has been doubled .",
    "the wave function is not definite positive when @xmath105 , and this leads to the known and irritating _ sign problem _ of the dmc algorithm .",
    "we have used the so - called _ fixed node approximation_. the auxiliary function @xmath106 will remain positive if both functions @xmath95 and @xmath107 have ( at any time ) the same nodal surfaces .",
    "the fixed node approximation consists in killing any walker which attempts to cross a nodal surface .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that this procedure leads to an upper bound to the ground state .",
    "we have first performed a vmc calculation to determine the free parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the importance sampling wave function . as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath50 are fixed by the atom - atom interaction at very short distances , and do not depend on the size of the cluster . on the contrary , the long - range parameters @xmath54 are very sensitive to the number of bosons .",
