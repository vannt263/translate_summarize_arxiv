    "in the article @xcite luna started a research program to classify wonderful @xmath0-varieties , for @xmath0 a reductive connected linear algebraic group over the field of complex numbers .    in this program ,",
    "wonderful varieties are to be classified by means of certain invariants called their _ spherical systems _ , which can be represented as combinatorial objects attached to the dynkin diagram of @xmath0 . a strategy to prove the classification , also known as the _ luna conjecture _ ,",
    "consists in reducing the problem to a distinguished class of wonderful varieties called primitive .",
    "this approach was already used in @xcite , where groups @xmath0 of semisimple type @xmath1 were considered , and in other works : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", we have extended the existing reduction techniques to groups @xmath0 of any semisimple type , and introduced new ones . the resulting notion of primitive wonderful varieties",
    "is given here in definition  [ def : primitive ] .",
    "their combinatorial counterparts , the primitive spherical systems , are discussed by the first - named author in @xcite , where a complete list of them is also obtained .",
    "it is known that these invariants distinguish between different @xmath0-isomorphism classes of wonderful varieties ( see @xcite ) , therefore the classification is achieved if one proves that each primitive system is _ geometrically realizable _ , i.e.  comes from a wonderful variety .    in this paper",
    "we complete this program .",
    "we briefly review the results leading to the definition of primitive spherical systems , and discuss each case of the lists of @xcite .",
    "some of them are already well - known , for example those corresponding to reductive wonderful subgroups of @xmath0 ( a reference with their spherical systems will be contained in a further work ) .",
    "we refer for brevity a few other known cases to existing publications , and we analyze in detail the remaining ones .",
    "a relevant byproduct of this proof of the luna conjecture is an explicit description , albeit laborious , of a generic stabilizer of a wonderful variety using only its spherical system .    indeed ,",
    "if a wonderful @xmath0-variety @xmath2 is non - primitive , or admits a so - called quotient of higher defect , then our reduction techniques provide a generic stabilizer @xmath3 of @xmath2 .",
    "the description of @xmath4 is concise , and relates @xmath4 to the generic stabilizers of those varieties that can be considered the `` primitive components '' of @xmath2 .",
