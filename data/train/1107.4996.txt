    "fluid suspensions of natural and technological interest are inevitably polydisperse .",
    "their constituent particles  each of which comprise a large number of smaller atoms , molecular , or ions  exhibit distinct geometric and chemical features ( size , shape , charge , etc . ) and hence represent different species of a many - component mixture .",
    "as might be expected , the composition of such a mixture can strongly affect its structural , thermodynamic , and dynamic behavior .",
    "@xcite for example , suspensions with narrowly distributed ( e.g. , approximately monodisperse ) particle characteristics often readily crystallize and thus can be interesting candidates for applications like colloidal self assembly .",
    "@xcite in contrast , fluids with more diverse particle populations that suppress crystallization  @xcite are more useful in applications which call for good glass - forming materials .    characterizing the properties of systems with a large number of components",
    "can be a formidable technical challenge .",
    "insufficient sampling typically limits the species - specific information that can be directly obtained via experiments and computer simulations .",
    "in fact , for suspensions with apparently  weak \" polydispersity , it is common practice to ignore particle differences altogether , adopting an effective one - component description .",
    "the latter is tantamount to assuming a fictitious pure - fluid model , whose ( typically softer ) interparticle interactions are those that , under equilibrium conditions , would reproduce some globally averaged behavior of the original polydisperse material .",
    "@xcite an obvious drawback of this simplification is that one generally does not know in advance whether a system s polydispersity is weak enough ( as it pertains to the properties of interest ) to justify use of an average description that washes out species - specific contributions .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to assess the impact of averaging _ a posteriori _ , especially when statistically meaningful information about the component contributions to the polydisperse material s properties is unavailable .",
    "this type of dilemma , though far from resolved , has long been appreciated and studied in colloid science .",
    "for example , it arises in considering the trade - offs between characterizing polydisperse colloidal suspensions by partial ( species - specific ) versus total ( average ) structure factors inferred from scattering data .",
    "@xcite although a multicomponent description is ideally desired , it can not generally be obtained from experiments without invoking a number of approximations that compromise its reliability .    in this study",
    ", we use computer simulations and exact theoretical results to examine how the static structure of a model polydisperse fluid differs when quantified based on multicomponent versus effective one - component descriptions of its pair correlations .",
    "similar in spirit to , e.g. , related work of pangburn and bevan,@xcite we focus exclusively on the real - space counterpart to the reciprocal - space scattering problem discussed above , the former being especially critical for the interpretation of data from computer simulations and optical microscopy experiments@xcite of complex fluids .",
    "the model we investigate here is a fluid of polydisperse hard - sphere particles with short - range , square - well attractions .",
    "earlier simulations@xcite show that it reproduces key static and dynamic behavior of suspended colloids with polymer - mediated depletion interactions .",
    "most notably , in agreement with experiments@xcite it displays strikingly anomalous dynamic behaviors at high particle concentrations near the so - called  repulsive \" glass transition ( e.g. , diffusivity increases and viscosity decreases with _ increasing _ particle attractions ) .",
    "interestingly , an effective one - component analysis@xcite suggests these behaviors emerge under conditions where the fluid also displays structural anomalies ( e.g. , static correlations apparently weaken with _ increasing _ particle attractions ) .",
    "of course , it is important to note that polydispersity is an important feature of this and similar models because it suppresses crystallization that would otherwise restrict access to the deeply supercooled fluid states where the anomalous behavior is most pronounced .    here , we use exact results to probe some of the consequences of adopting the effective one - component description for the structure of the aforementioned model in the dilute limit . to carry out a similar analysis at high particle concentrations , we introduce monte carlo sampling techniques that allow us to accurately determine the @xmath0 partial radial distribution functions as well as the free energy for a @xmath1 pseudo - component [ in this case , @xmath2 ; @xmath3 description of the model .",
    "the main findings of this study are as follows .",
    "( 1 )  the multicomponent ( i.e. , partial ) and effective one - component radial distribution functions show qualitatively different behavior as a function of the magnitude of the interparticle attractions , even for this moderately polydisperse model .",
    "this serves as a cautionary note regarding conclusions that one might otherwise draw about structure in polydisperse systems based on trends exhibited by the latter globally - averaged , static correlations .",
    "( 2 )  the pair - correlation contribution to the excess entropy of the polydisperse fluid based on the multicomponent description , in contrast to the estimate based on the one - component model , very closely approximates the full thermodynamic excess entropy of the system .",
    "this suggests that techniques which allow one to accurately determine the partial radial distribution functions of dense , polydisperse colloids will also furnish information key for understanding their thermodynamic behavior .",
    "( 3 )  finally , the excess entropy scaling for the shear viscosity of this polydisperse fluid is similar in some key ways to that of liquid water , another system known to exhibit anomalous thermodynamic and dynamic properties .",
    "as we show , such similarities are not apparent if the effective one - component description is used in the excess entropy estimation for the polydisperse colloidal fluid .",
    "we consider a previously introduced model@xcite comprising hard - sphere particles with short - range , square - well ( sw ) attractions .",
    "the pair potential between particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( with diameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) is given by    @xmath8    here , @xmath9 is the separation between particle centers , @xmath10 is the hard - core contact separation , and @xmath11 is the depth of the attractive well .",
    "the particle diameters  @xmath12 of this polydisperse fluid follow a truncated normal distribution with a mean value of @xmath13 and a standard deviation of @xmath14 .",
    "the truncation ensures that all particle diameters of the fluid are within 3 standard deviations of the mean ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this degree of polydispersity in the particle population , while still modest , is significant enough to discourage crystallization in simulations , allowing access to deeply supercooled fluid states.@xcite    as discussed extensively elsewhere,@xcite short - range attractions like those exhibited by this model can give rise to unusual dependencies of shear viscosity ( which decreases ) and self diffusivity ( which increases ) with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath18 is temperature .",
    "these trends capture what is observed experimentally@xcite for suspensions of hard - sphere - like colloids with polymer - mediated depletion attractions .",
    "interestingly , an effective one - component analysis of this model s pair correlations@xcite suggests that the aforementioned dynamic anomalies are accompanied by a structural anomaly ( i.e. , increasing @xmath16 _ weakens _ the effective pair correlations ) . in this work",
    ", we test whether this feature also emerges from a multicomponent analysis .      for the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , we approximate the model introduced in section  [ sec : model ] by a closely related mixture of 60 pseudo - components .",
    "particle diameters in the pseudo - component mixture exhibit continuous polydispersity , and their pairwise interactions @xmath19 are described by eq .",
    "[ eq : swsrapotential ] .",

    "a key problem associated with the effective one - component analysis is an artificial , polydispersity - induced `` softening '' of the apparent static correlations  due to averaging over different particle sizes  which in turn causes the entropic consequences of structural ordering to be significantly underestimated . as an example of the implications of this issue",
