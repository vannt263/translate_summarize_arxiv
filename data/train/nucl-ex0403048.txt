    "the single particle inclusive @xmath0 distribution averaged over all particles in all events in a p - p experiment ( inclusive ) or in a given centrality class in an a+a experiment ( semi - inclusive ) is usually written in the form : @xmath2 equation  [ eq : ptdist ] represents a gamma distribution with @xmath3 , where , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and typically @xmath6 ( gev / c)@xmath7 for p - p collisions .",
    "the ` inverse slope parameter ' @xmath8 is sometimes referred to as the ` temperature parameter ' .    for events with @xmath9 detected charged particles with magnitudes of transverse momenta ,",
    "@xmath10 , the event - by - event average @xmath0 , denoted @xmath11 is defined as :    @xmath12    for the case of statistical independent emission , where the fluctuations are purely random , an analytical formula for the distribution in @xmath11 can be obtained assuming negative binomial ( nbd ) distributed event - by - event multiplicity , with gamma distributed semi - inclusive @xmath0 spectra .",
    "@xcite the formula depends on the 4 semi - inclusive parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 which are derived from the means and standard deviations of the semi - inclusive @xmath0 and multiplicity distributions , @xmath13 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 . for fixed @xmath9 , and purely random fluctuations , the mean and standard deviation of @xmath11 follow the expected behavior , @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in phenix , equation  [ eq : nbdgamma ] is used to confirm the randomness of mixed - events ( figure  [ fig : mixedevtcheck ] ) .",

    "mixed - events are used to define the baseline for random fluctuations of @xmath11 in phenix  @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage of effectively removing any residual detector - dependent effects .",
    "the event - by - event average distributions are very sensitive to the number of tracks in the event ( denoted @xmath9 or @xmath24 ) , so the mixed event sample is produced with the _ identical _ @xmath24 distribution as the data .",
    "additionally , no two tracks from the same data event are placed in the same mixed event in order to remove any intra - event correlations in @xmath0 .",
    "finally , @xmath25 must exactly match the semi - inclusive @xmath18 .",
    "as noted above , the randomness of @xmath11 for the mixed - event sample is tested by comparison to equation  [ eq : nbdgamma ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : mixedevtcheck ] shows the excellent agreement between the calculation and the mixed event @xmath11 distributions for the 0 - 5% centrality class .",
    "the standard deviations , @xmath26 , differ by less than 0.04% .",
    "this represents the maximum error from any effects introduced by the event mixing procedure .",
    "the measured @xmath11 distributions for the data in two centrality classes for @xmath1 gev au+au collisions in phenix are shown in figure  [ fig : mpt ] ( data points ) compared to the mixed - event distributions ( histograms ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath28 is striking . to further understand this dependence and the source of these non - random fluctuations ,",
    "@xmath27 was measured over a varying @xmath0 range , ( figure  [ fig : ft ] ) , where @xmath29 gev / c for the @xmath28 dependence .",
    "the increase of @xmath27 with @xmath30 suggests elliptic flow or jet origin .",
    "this was investigated using a monte carlo simulation of correlations due to elliptic flow and jets in the phenix acceptance .",
    "the flow was significant only in the lowest centrality bin and negligible ( @xmath31% ) at higher centralities .",
    "jets were simulated by embedding [ at a uniform rate per generated particle , @xmath32 p - p hard - scattering events from the pythia event generator into simulated au+au events assembled at random according to the measured @xmath24 and semi - inclusive @xmath0 distributions .",
    "this changed @xmath18 and @xmath19 by less than 0.1% .",
    "@xmath33 was either constant for all centrality classes , or scaled by the measured hard - scattering suppression factor @xmath34 for @xmath35 gev / c .",
    "@xcite a value @xmath36% for p - p collisions was extracted from pure pythia events in the phenix acceptance in agreement with the p - p measurement .",
    "the value of @xmath33 was chosen so that the simulation with @xmath37 agreed with the data at @xmath38 .",
    "the centrality and @xmath30 dependences of the measured @xmath27 match the simulation very well , but only when the @xmath39 scaling is included .",
    "a less experiment - dependent method to compare non - random fluctuations is to assume that the entire @xmath27 is due to temperature fluctuations of the initial state , with rms variation @xmath40 :  @xcite @xmath41 this yields @xmath40=1.8% for central collisions and 3.7% at the peak of @xmath27 , which puts severely small limits on the critical - fluctuations that were expected .",
