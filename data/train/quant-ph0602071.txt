    "several branches of quantum optics from non - linear optics to laser - physics and cavity qed are very actively engaged in a variety of processes producing non - classical light .",
    "such radiation fields attract attention , not only because they provide a platform for testing fundamental concepts of quantum theory , but also for applications of importance like precision measurements in interferometry  @xcite . moreover , rapidly developing area of quantum computation and information theory has kindled further interest in generating and manipulating non - classical radiation fields - called quantum continuous variable states .",
    "these states are promising candidates for many applications of quantum information technology  @xcite .",
    "in such a context , gaussian light fields gain prominence , both in view of their conceptual and experimental importance . however , a need to leap beyond gaussian domain has been emphasized  @xcite and the degaussification process has been catching a lot of interest .",
    "degaussification can be realized in a simple manner by adding ( subtracting ) photons to ( from ) a gaussian field and the resulting states are known to exhibit non - classical properties such as negativity of the wigner function  @xcite , antibunching  @xcite , sub - poissonian photon statistics  @xcite or squeezing in one of the quadratures of the field  @xcite etc .",
    "almost a decade ago agarwal and tara  @xcite introduced , theoretically , a new class of non - gaussian states , which is obtained by repeated application of the photon creation operator on the coherent state . the resulting class of states were identified to lie between the fock state and the coherent state and were indeed non - classical .",
    "recently , single photon excitation of a classical coherent field has been generated experimentally  @xcite and ultrafast , time - domain , quantum homodyne tomography technique has explicitly demonstrated a quantum to classical transition . in another development , a traveling non - gaussian field",
    "was experimentally produced by subtracting a photon from a squeezed vacuum  @xcite . while the pulsed homodyne detection scheme confirmed non - gaussian statistics for the photon",
    "subtracted squeezed vacuum , the wigner function reconstructed from the experimental data failed to exhibit negativity .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the non - classicality of photon subtracted gaussian fields and identified that the photo detection efficiency as well as the modal purity parameter were not high enough to record a negative wigner function in the experiment  @xcite of wenger _",
    "_ moreover , kim _ et al . _ show that unless the input gaussian radiation is non - classical , one can not generate a non - classical field through photon subtraction  @xcite .",
    "they also point out the contrasting situation of photon addition to gaussian fields , where even a highly classical state like thermal state turns out to be non - classical  @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that photon addition to a thermal state results in the removal of the vacuum part  @xcite and hence leads to a _ truncated thermal state_. all such _ truncated states _ , with their vacuum contribution removed , are shown to be non - classical by lee  @xcite .    in view of the current experimental progress",
    "@xcite in the production of non - gaussian radiation fields , and also in the tomographic reconstruction  @xcite of wigner functions of quantum states , it is timely to analyze the non - classicality of photon added classical radiation fields , through negativity of their wigner functions . in this paper , we investigate photon added coherent and thermal states .",
    "entanglement , another striking quantum feature , has occupied a central position in the development of quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "there has been a considerable progress in understanding the connection between non - classicality and entanglement .",
    "it has been identified  @xcite that non - classicality is an unmistakable source of entanglement .",
    "a beam splitter is capable of converting non - classicality of a single mode radiation into bipartite entanglement .",
    "this property viz .",
    ", _ non - classicality as an entanglement resource _ , has been employed recently  @xcite , to identify _ entanglement potential _ ( ep ) - a computable measure of non - classicality - of single mode radiation fields .",
    "ep allows us to analyze the degree of non - classicality of a given single mode radiation field .",
    "we compute ep of photon added coherent states ( pacs ) and show that the ep reduces with the increase of seed beam intensity , which is in confirmation with the analysis of the wigner function of the state .",
    "a comparison of ep s of single , two and three photon added coherent states reveals that non - classicality of pacs increases with the addition of more number of photons .",
    "we verify that the wigner function of a photon added thermal state is negative at the phase space origin for all temperatures , while the ep of the state , evaluated in the low temperature limit , reveals that non - classicality of the state reduces with increasing temperature .",
    "generally a non - classical state is recognized as one , which can not be written as a statistical mixture of coherent states .",
    "it has been well accepted that the non - existence of a well defined glauber - sudarshan p - function  @xcite implies _ non - classicality _ of a given state .",
    "however this identification poses operational difficulties , as it requires complete information of the state to be examined , so that it s p - function can be reconstructed .",
    "several operational criteria , which are equivalent to the one based on the p - function and which can be used to distinguish between classical and non - classical states in experimental measurements have been proposed from the early days of quantum optics .",
    "such signatures of non - classicality , verifiable in a simple experiment are , antibunching  @xcite and sub - poissonian photon statistics  @xcite , squeezing  @xcite , photon number oscillations  @xcite , negative value of wigner function  @xcite , etc .    here",
    ", we focus our attention on the wigner function of a given quantum state . the non - classicality character of a state is strongly registered by negativity of the wigner function . especially , fock states show a negative dip around the phase space origin , as has been clearly reflected in the experimentally reconstructed wigner function  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there has been an ongoing effort towards more efficient quantum homodyne tomographic techniques  @xcite , and in such a context , analysis of wigner function proves to be useful .",
    "the wigner function of a system , characterized by the density operator @xmath0 is defined  @xcite through @xmath1 basically wigner function is a quasi - probability distribution representing quantum states in phase space .",
    "it is not a true probability distribution as it can take negative values also .",
    "if , for a state , wigner function takes negative value , the quantum state has no classical analog .",
    "however , the converse does not hold good : when the wigner function is positive everywhere , one can not conclude that the state is classical .",
    "for example , for a squeezed state , wigner function is a gaussian and is positive throughout .",
    "but , squeezed radiation  @xcite is one of the most important non - classical field .",
    "thus , one has to resort to other measures of non - classicality .",
    "there have been several approaches to quantify non - classicality of a state through universal measures like , hillery s non - classical distance  @xcite and lee s non - classical depth  @xcite .",
    "distance between a given non - classical state and the set of all classical states is non - zero and hence , serves as a measure of non - classicality , called _ non - classical distance _",
    "however , identifying an optimal reference classical state is one of the main problems associated with these distance based measures  @xcite of non - classicality .",
    "lee s  @xcite non - classical depth , @xmath2 , is essentially the quantity of smoothing required to transform a non - positive p - function into a well behaved positive distribution .",
    "( non - classical depth @xmath3 is also interpreted as the minimum average number of thermal photons that are necessary to destroy the non - classical effects of a given state ) .",
    "a classical state has @xmath4 for a pure gaussian state ( squeezed vacuum ) , the non - classical depth varies between 0 and @xmath5  @xcite ; for all non - gaussian pure states @xmath6  @xcite , thus placing all such states to be identical , as far as their non - classicality is concerned .",
    "therefore , this criterion forces one to conclude that the non - classicality of pacs is independent of the seed beam intensity .",
    "moreover , non - classical depth of photon added thermal states ( for that matter , all _ truncated states _ ) is shown to be a maximum i.e. , @xmath6  @xcite . according to this measure , photon added thermal states are equally ( maximally ) non - classical at all temperatures .    in this paper , we consider entanglement potential ( ep )  @xcite , as a universal measure of non - classicality for our discussion of pacs and photon added thermal states .",
    "ep gives the amount of two - mode entanglement that can be generated from a non - classical input state , in a linear optics set up .",
    "it is important to note here that a classical single mode radiation _ does not _",
    "get entangled in such an arrangement  @xcite .",
    "ep is nothing but the logarithmic negativity  @xcite of a bipartite quantum state @xmath7 which results from mixing a given single mode state @xmath8 , with vacuum state , in a @xmath9 beam splitter .",
    "more specifically , ep is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the partial transpose of a two - mode density operator @xmath12 . in equation ( [ epot ] ) , the symbol @xmath13 denotes the trace norm is given by @xmath14 , where the negativity @xmath15 is the sum @xmath16 of all the negative eigenvalues of @xmath17 . ] and @xmath18 corresponds to a @xmath9 beam splitter i.e. , @xmath19 whose action ( heisenberg view point ) on the creation operators @xmath20 of the two input ports is explicitly given by @xmath21 _ the state @xmath8 is said to be non - classical , iff its entanglement potential is nonzero_. ep has been evaluated  @xcite for a variety of non - classical states like squeezed states , even and odd coherent states , fock states etc .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to a study on photon addition to ( i ) coherent state , an example of a pure gaussian state and ( ii ) thermal state , a mixed gaussian state , both of which are well - known classical states .",
    "action of photon creation operator on these states results in non - classical , non - gaussian states .",
    "we study the non - classicality of these states through negativity of the wigner function and the entanglement potential .",
    "coherent states are the analogs of classical radiation fields .",
    "these states are described by a poissonian photon number distribution and have a well defined amplitude and phase .",
    "it is interesting to see how these states turn non - classical , when a single quantum of radiation excites them .    .",

    "let us first consider a spacs .",

    "we have computed them numerically and plots of entanglement potential for single , two and three photon added coherent states are given in fig .",
