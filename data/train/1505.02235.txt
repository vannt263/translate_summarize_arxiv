    "so far , many inflation models have been constructed in 4 dimensional ( 4d ) @xmath0 sugra . in many literatures",
    ", it is assumed that the inflationary potential is provided by the so - called f - term potential . however , there are some problems in such models due to the structure of sugra , such as the @xmath5 problem in sugra , which is caused by the factor @xmath6 in the f - term potential where @xmath7 denotes the khler potential",

    "@xcite . in those models ,",
    "the existence of at least two chiral multiplets are required to realize inflation , and the multiplet other than the inflaton multiplet should have a sufficiently large quartic coupling in the khler potential , otherwise it becomes tachyonic or light , which may lead to an instability of the inflationary trajectory or an unacceptably large non - gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "the solution for such a problem is the realization of inflation without the additional chiral multiplet , that is , the inflation with a single multiplet . such a model was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and recently developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the other interesting solution was suggested in refs .  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the inflaton multiplet is a massive u(1 ) vector multiplet  @xcite , which is equivalent to a combination of stueckelberg chiral and anti - chiral multiplets and a massless vector multiplet .",
    "the inflation is driven by the scalar component of the massive vector multiplet .",
    "one of the advantages of such a model is that only the single massive vector multiplet is the sufficient source for inflation , and the @xmath5 problem is absent because the inflaton potential is provided by the so - called d - term potential .",
    "therefore , the inflation is realized in a relatively simple way .    from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "it is important to consider the uv completion of such sugra inflation models .",
    "especially , in superstring theory , it is known that the action of vector fields are described by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) type action  @xcite if the vector fields are zero modes of open strings attached to the d - branes ( see ref .",

    "then , in such a case , the massive vector multiplet inflation may be realized with the dbi action .",
    "the supersymmetric ( susy ) realization of the dbi action has been intently studied e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite . especially , it was found that the dbi action in @xmath0 4d global susy naturally appears from the partial @xmath8 susy breaking  @xcite , which is realized by imposing a condition between two @xmath0 multiplets included in an @xmath8 vector multiplet .",
    "the condition can also be embedded into sugra  @xcite , which realizes the dbi action in 4d @xmath0 sugra .",
    "the matter coupled dbi action was also discussed in 4d @xmath0 global susy  @xcite and sugra  @xcite .",

    "such an action can be constructed by the dbi action of a massless vector multiplet coupled to the stueckelberg multiplet , which non - linearly transforms under the corresponding u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "the dbi action with charged matter multiplets was studied in our previous work  @xcite as mentioned above .",
    "such a dbi - extended action contains higher order terms of the matter fields , associated with supersymmetric higher derivative couplings .",
    "we call them the dbi corrections throughout this paper .",
    "we found that the dbi corrections significantly modify the d - term potential .",
    "as we will show , the dbi corrections become important if the cut - off scale associated with the dbi action is smaller than the planck scale .",
    "contrary to a naive expectation , the corrections make the scalar potential flatter .",
    "this is an interesting feature of the dbi - extension .",
    "we demonstrate such a feature for two concrete models , which are the chaotic  @xcite and the starobinsky model  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the starobinsky model in the new minimal sugra is dual to the massive vector multiplet action .",
    "we will also investigate the dbi - extension of the former , and find that it is dual to a special class of the massive dbi action , which has a restricted form of the matter couplings .",
