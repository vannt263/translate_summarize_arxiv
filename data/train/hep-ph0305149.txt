    "at present time , it is generally accepted that qcd is the theory of strong interactions between mesons and baryons .",
    "moreover , it should describe the physical phenomena in dense hadronic matter as well . since the usual ( perturbative ) methods of qcd are applicable only at sufficiently high values of the baryon density @xmath6 , in the region of low and moderate densities one should use nonperturbative methods , e.g. lattice qcd calculations @xcite , or effective field theory considerations .",
    "the latter ones are especially useful if the influence of external magnetic field on the properties of dense hadronic matter is investigated ( in this case the incorporation of strong magnetic field into lattice calculations is not eleborated sufficiently ) .",
    "it is well - known that at low ( baryon ) densities @xmath7 , where @xmath8 @xmath9 is the normal density of baryons inside nuclei , hadronic matter is just the ordinary nuclear matter .",
    "the widely - known relativistic effective theory for nuclei and nuclear matter is the walecka model @xcite . in this model",
    "the protons and neutrons , i.e. the simplest baryons ( nucleons ) , are point particles .",
    "moreover , the existence of stable objects with large baryonic number , which are droplets of simplest massive baryons and hence might be identified with nuclei , is predicted in the framework of it with the help of the condensed matter ( thermodynamic ) approach .",
    "unfortunately , the walecka model is unrealistic in the region of moderate densities near to the chiral phase transition , where it is necessary to take into account the internal quark structure of protons and neutrons .",
    "similar conditions exist in the experiments on relativistic ion - ion collisions , where it is expected that for a short time stable clumps of quark matter ( usually called quark droplets ) with rather large baryonic number might be created .",
    "another example is presented by neutron stars , where under extreme pressure nucleons might fuse together , forming droplets of quarks ( evidently , the baryonic density inside quark droplets is larger , than @xmath10 ) .",
    "one of the widely - known effective theory of quark - hadronic matter is the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , which was successfully used in describing low - energy meson physics @xcite , diquarks @xcite and meson - baryon interactions @xcite . in the framework of the njl model quarks",
    "are treated as elementary point - like particles , whereas mesons are collective quark - antiquark exitations of its ground state .",
    "this model can also serve as a starting point for investigations of the mass spectrum of the octet and decuplet of baryons ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to be applicable to dense quark - hadronic matter , the njl model should predict the existence of stable multiquark droplets as well , i.e. of stable finite - size objects in space , which are composed of more than 3 quarks and do not tend to shrink to a point or to expand over the whole space .",
    "one particular way to investigate such objects in the njl model and which we will follow in this paper is based on the use of the general condensed matter approach restricted to vanishing temperature @xmath11 . in this case a stable multiquark object of the system is identified with a droplet of the dense quark phase , surrounded by the vacuum phase with zero baryonic density .",
    "hence , if there is the thermally equilibrated coexistence of these two phases , then one may conclude about the existence of stable quark droplets . just in this way",
    ", the problem of quark matter stability was investigated at zero external magnetic field @xmath0 in @xcite in the framework of a chirally symmetric njl model .",
    "let us quote the two main results of these papers : i ) at @xmath12 , stabilization of ( multi)quark droplets is only possible , when they consist of massless quarks , ii ) the stability requirement puts strong constraints on the acceptable values of model parameters ( coupling constant @xmath2 , cutoff parameter @xmath13 etc ) . in particular",
    ", it was shown that in the thermodynamic approach based on the njl model , quark droplets can be schematically interpreted as mit - type bags .",
    "however , in the mit 3-quark bag model the bag constant is a phenomenological input parameter @xcite , whereas in the njl model it is a dynamical quantity originating from the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "taking into account the fact that inside neutron stars the magnetic field strength might reach extremely high values ( the influence of ultra - strong magnetic fields on physical processes inside neutron stars and on properties of dense quark matter are under permanent investigations @xcite ) , it seems to us important to reinvestigate the problem of the quark droplet stability in the framework of njl - type models at @xmath14 .",
    "in the present paper , we study , in particular , the influence of a constant homogeneous external magnetic field @xmath0 in a simple njl model with two quark flavors . in section 2 ,",
    "the stability constraints on the model parameters as well as on the chemical potential @xmath15 are presented . apart from this",
    ", the phase structure of the model is found at @xmath16 , @xmath12 and @xmath17 . on this basis , it is shown that at @xmath12 stability of multiquark droplets , which consist here only of massless quarks , occurs at @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the number of flavored quarks . in sections 3 , 4 and 5 the problem of the existence of multiquark droplets is discussed at @xmath14 . in particular , it is argued on the basis of our earlier papers @xcite that for each value @xmath2 smaller than @xmath21 , the stability of quark droplets is induced by an external magnetic field . moreover , for each @xmath22 it is shown that in contrast to the case @xmath12 @xcite , there exists an external magnetic field value @xmath23 gauss such , that at @xmath24 multiquark droplets may be formed from massive quarks .",
    "moreover , we have shown using energetical arguments that the magnetic field promotes the creation of stable quark droplets and enhances the stability of it even at @xmath1 .",
    "let us first give several ( very approximative ) arguments motivating the chosen structure of our qcd - motivated njl model introduced below .",
    "for this aim , consider two - flavor qcd , @xmath25 , with nonzero chemical potential and color group @xmath26 ( in our case @xmath27 ) . by integrating in the generating functional of qcd over gluons and further `` approximating '' the nonperturbative gluon propagator by a @xmath28function , one arrives at an effective local chiral four - quark interaction of the njl type describing low energy hadron physics . finally , by performing a fierz transformation of the interaction term and taking into account",
    "only scalar and pseudo - scalar @xmath29 interactions , one obtains a four - fermionic model given by the following lagrangian ( in minkovski space - time notation ) as well as scalar and pseudo - scalar , vector and axial - vector - like @xmath30-interactions .",
    "however , in order to simplify the studying of the quark matter stability problem in the presence of external magnetic field , these additional terms are omitted .",
    "the role of the interaction in the diquark channel is discussed in the last section 5 . ]",

    "\\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath32 is the chemical potential of quarks which is the same for all flavors .",
    "furthermore , we use the notations @xmath33 for pauli matrices in the flavor space . clearly , the model ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under the continuous chiral @xmath34 group . apart from this ,",
    "it is invariant under the discrete chiral transformation , @xmath35 .",
    "( since the baryonic charge is conserved , there exists also a corresponding @xmath36-invariance of the model ) . at tree level",
    ", the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) contains besides of the chemical potential only one free model parameter , i.e. the coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , when including quantum effects ( loops ) and performing necessary regularizations , an additional cutoff parameter @xmath13 will appear .",
    "an illustrative way for the investigation of stable quark droplets in quantum field theory is based on a schematic analogy with the thermodynamical approach to the liquid - gas first order phase transition .",
    "in such a picture one can consider the quark droplet as a droplet of the dense liquid phase of the system , whereas the low - density gas phase corresponds to the vacuum ( the zero density state ) which surrounds the quark droplet ( strictly speaking , such an analogy makes really sense only for systems at finite temperature ) .",
    "moreover , we suppose that the two phases are in the thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "of course , in this way , i.e. when ignoring surface effects of droplets , we have an adequate consideration of the quark matter stability problem only for quark droplets which contain a very large number of quarks inside a large volume ( for comparison see @xcite , where surface effects of droplets were taken into account ) .",
    "it turns out that not for all values of input parameters of the system this schematic picture of the existence of stable quark droplets is realized .",
    "thus , the stability problem of quark droplets arises , which might be expressed in terms of several quantitative constraints on the parameters of the system .",
    "to solve these constraints means to find the values of the parameters of the system at which there might appear stable quark droplets at moderate densities .",
    "let us next describe these stability constraints .",
    "recall first that in the thermal and chemical equilibrium between vacuum and dense quark matter phases their ( critical ) chemical potentials , denoted as @xmath37 , are equal . then , from the analogy with condensed matter physics , one can get the following relations between thermodynamical and dynamical parameters at which the two phases do coexist ( called below stability constraints ) : @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the dynamical mass of one - quark excitations of the vacuum and @xmath40 is the mass of quarks in the dense phase , i.e. inside the quark droplets ( see also @xcite )",
    ". must be smaller than the mass of the vacuum one - particle exitations @xmath39 ( such particles have enough energy for leaving the vacuum , which is empty due to this reason ) .",
    "however , in order that quarks do not leave the dense phase , their mass @xmath40 must be smaller than @xmath37  the minimum particle energy , necessary for leaving the system . ]",
    "note that the values of @xmath41 are supplied by the thermodynamic potential @xmath42 of the system , where the average of the composite scalar @xmath43-field @xmath44 is the order parameter of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking which in the thermal equilibrium is the global minimum point @xmath45 of the function @xmath42 versus @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , @xmath45 equals to the dynamical quark mass which is determined by the gap equation @xmath47 .",
    "( obviously , if @xmath48 , the ground state is chirally invariant . ) hence , in order to find all the admissable values of parameters of the model , at which stable quark droplets could exist in the quantum system at moderate density , it is sufficient to solve the stability constraint ( [ stab ] ) with respect to these parameters . on this route",
    "one should perform several technical steps : i ) get the thermodynamic potential @xmath42 ; ii ) find the global minimum point of @xmath42 vs @xmath46 and establish its dependence on the external parameters of the theory thereby obtaining the phase structure of the model ; iii ) choose all the first order phase transition critical points @xmath37 obeing the constraint ( [ stab ] ) .",
    "of the 1st order phase transition , the order parameter @xmath45 changes its value by a jump , i.e. at this line it is a discontinuous function vs input parameters of the model . at the critical line of the second order phase transition",
    "the order parameter is a continuous function , but first- or higher order derivatives of it are discontinuous . ] the corresponding values of allowed parameters obtained in this way are just the physically acceptable ones , at which stable quark matter might be described by the initial model .",
    "now let us carry out this scheme on the basis of the chosen njl model .      in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential of the model ( 1 ) is given by the expression @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the number of colors , i.e. @xmath27 , and @xmath25 .",
    "using for the divergent integral in ( [ 8 ] ) a lorentz noninvariant regularization ( this procedure is simply the replacement of the infinite integration region in ( [ 8 ] ) in favour of the compact one : @xmath52 , where the cutoff parameter @xmath13 is an additional parameter of the theory to be fitted by the experimental data ) , one can find the following expression @xmath53- \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac { n_f\\theta(\\mu - m)}{8\\pi^2}\\left [ \\mu(2\\mu^2 - 5m^2)\\sqrt{\\mu^2-m^2 } + 3m^4\\ln\\left ( \\frac { \\mu+\\sqrt{\\mu^2-m^2}}{m}\\right ) \\right ] .",

    "hence , equation ( [ 13 ] ) has a nontrivial solution @xmath63 if and only if the constraint @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) is fulfilled . in this case",
    ", the global minimum of the function @xmath66 lies at @xmath67 .",
    "thus , both the continuous and discrete chiral symmetries of the njl  model are spontaneously broken .",
    "( at @xmath68 the stationarity equation ( [ 13 ] ) has only the trivial solution @xmath69 .",
    "thus , in this case the vacuum is chirally invariant , and fermions have zero mass . since this phase is not adequate to the real qcd vacuum at @xmath70 , we will not consider in detail the undercritical values of the coupling constant in the present paper . ) evidently , among the three parameters @xmath71 only two are independent ones at @xmath72 . in the following it",
    "is sometimes convenient to use @xmath13 and @xmath67 as independent free parameters of the model at @xmath72 .",
    "clearly , @xmath67 is here the mass of the one - quark excitation of the chirally - noninvariant vacuum with zero baryon density which , at @xmath12 , is just the quantity @xmath39 from ( [ stab ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath73 and there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "note first of all that for @xmath68 and arbitrary values of @xmath15 , the chiral symmetry is not spontaneously broken down . however , above the critical coupling constant the situation is more complicated .",
    "recall , that in this case the phase structure of the simplest njl model with @xmath76 and lorentz invariant regularization was investigated in @xcite .",
    "using the same methods , it is easy to obtain the phase structure of model ( [ 1 ] ) for the lorentz - noninvariant regularization considered above .",
    "thus , without any preliminary calculational discussions , we present the phase portrait of the njl model ( 1 ) schematically on fig . 1 . on this figure",
    "one can see the @xmath77-plane , which is divided into three domains : a , b , c. there is a symmetric dense phase with massless quarks for points @xmath78 a. in the region b , the phase with zero baryon density is realized . in this phase the chiral symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken down , and quarks aquire a mass @xmath67 .",
    "( in this sense , phase b models the real qcd vacuum . ) finally , the region c on this figure corresponds to the dense chirally noninvariant phase , in which quarks have a nonzero @xmath15-dependent mass .",
    "the boundaries between these phases are the critical lines of second order phase transitions ( solid lines on fig .",
    "1 ) , or first order ones ( dashed curves on fig .",
    "1 ) . in particular , the curve @xmath79 is the critical line of the second order phase transitions , since the second order derivative @xmath80 of the global minimum point @xmath45 of the potential @xmath42 is a discontinuous function vs @xmath15 on this curve .",
    "the curve @xmath81 ( all points of this critical curve lie below the line @xmath82 ) is defined by the equation @xmath83 i.e. on this line the order parameter of the system  the global minimum point @xmath45  changes its value by a jump from @xmath67 to 0 , and a first order phase transition takes place . solving ( [ 16 ] ) in the region @xmath84 , one can obtain the manifest form of this curve : @xmath85 moreover , there are two tricritical points @xmath86 and @xmath87 on this phase portrait .",
    "their coordinates are : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 is defined in ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "now one can easily see that constraints ( [ stab ] ) are fulfilled at @xmath93 ( or in terms of coupling constants @xmath2 and @xmath4 , stability constraints ( [ stab ] ) are valid only at @xmath94 ) .",
    "indeed , for each such value of @xmath67 there is a corresponding critical value of the chemical potential @xmath95 ( [ 17 ] ) ( recall , that @xmath96 ) at which the two phases do coexist . in other words , in this case stable droplets of the dense phase a are surrounded by the chirally noninvariant vacuum ( phase b ) with zero baryon density .",
    "obviously , the inequalities ( [ stab ] ) are valid , since in the case under consideration @xmath97 and @xmath98 . and @xmath87 of fig",
    ". 1 , are also suitable ones . however , in this case there is the coexistence of two dense phases , and the physical vacuum can not be identified with one of them .",
    "so , we reject the corresponding values of @xmath99 at @xmath12 . ]",
    "the baryon density inside the quark droplet is easily calculated from the relation : @xmath100 now , in the framework of the njl model , one can imagine for @xmath93 the following quark matter transition in dependence on the average baryonic density @xmath6 : at sufficiently small @xmath6 a rather small amount of quark droplets , having a rather small size , appears in the space .",
    "the droplets are composed of massless quarks and surrounded by the vacuum with zero baryon density ; however , inside each droplet the baryonic density equals to @xmath101 ( [ 18 ] ) . with growth of @xmath6",
    "the number of droplets as well as their sizes are increasing .",
    "when @xmath6 reaches the value @xmath101 , the total space is occupied by massless quarks .    finally , notice that the existence of stable quark droplets surrounded by a chirally noninvariant vacuum was also considered in the framework of a njl model in @xcite .",
    "however , there the problem was investigated only for three physically interesting sets of parameters : @xmath102 , @xmath103 mev ( set 1 ) , @xmath104 , @xmath105 mev ( set 2 ) and @xmath106 , @xmath107 mev ( set 3 ) .",
    "of course , the corresponding results are reproduced by our ones : for set 1 stable quark droplets are forbidden , but for sets 2,3 stable droplets are formed from massless quarks . in particular , it follows from ( [ 18 ] ) that @xmath108 for set 2 and @xmath109 for set 3 ( here @xmath110 is the ordinary nuclear matter density ) . in the present paper",
    "we have generalized these considerations and found the exact interval @xmath111 corresponding to stable quark droplet formation .",
    "let us next study the phase structure of the njl model ( [ 1 ] ) containing @xmath113- and @xmath114-quarks with electric charges @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 is the electric charge of electrons ) , respectively .",
    "due to the difference in quark electric charges , the continuous chiral symmetry is violated in the presence of an external magnetic field , but the discrete one , @xmath35 , is not .",
    "it is useful to consider first the vacuum case with @xmath118 , where the thermodynamic potential of the system looks like : @xmath119 where @xmath27 .",
    "this expression can easily be transformed into the following one ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath120\\ln x_i + \\frac{x_i^2}4\\bigr\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is given in ( [ 9 ] ) at @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "this fact reflects the symmetry of the original model under discrete chiral transformation @xmath35 in the presence of an external magnetic field .",

    "moreover , it follows from our consideration that at @xmath14 , in contrast to the case @xmath12 , stable multiquark clumps might be composed both from massless quarks ( at @xmath192 ) , and _ massive _ ones ( at @xmath193 ) .",
    "these are the main results of our paper .",
    "remark , that usually the value of the cutoff parameter @xmath13 varies in the interval @xmath201 gev . in this case , the magnitude of @xmath202 can be estimated to be of the order @xmath203 gauss .",
    "gauss ( where @xmath204 and @xmath117 are the mass and the electric charge of an electron , respectively ) , which permits to connect ( mev)@xmath205 and gauss units . ] according to modern estimates , the strength of the magnetic field at the surface of neutron stars can reach @xmath206 gauss , and at the star core it may be as large as @xmath207 gauss @xcite .",
    "hence , for @xmath157 as well as for some neighbouring values of @xmath67 , the njl model may predict the existence of stable multiquark clumps , composed of _ massive _ quarks , inside neutron stars .",
    "note finally , that for arbitrary values of @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , quark droplet stabilization is induced by the external magnetic field in the same manner , as in the case @xmath157 .    at @xmath182 and in the presence of an external magnetic field , the zero density vacuum phase b ( @xmath160 )",
    "might coexist only with the dense phase a ( @xmath97 ) at @xmath208 .",
    "critical values @xmath37 of the chemical potential in these cases are depicted on figs 4 , 5 for @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively .",
    "it follows from these figures that the stability constraints ( [ stab ] ) are also fulfilled , so the stable quark droplets are allowed to exist . as in the case",
    "@xmath12 ( see @xcite ) , at @xmath182 and @xmath14 the finite lumps of stable quark matter are schematically the bags of massless quarks only .",
    "the phase structure of the njl model at @xmath14 and @xmath17 was studied in @xcite , but for qualitatively other values of model parameters . in particular ,",
    "the stability problem of multiquark clumps was not considered in these articles .",
    "thus , in view of our present results , let us now discuss it in these cases , too . in @xcite , in connection with the magnetic catalysis effect , the influence of an external magnetic field on the dense njl model was investigated at @xmath211 .",
    "it turns out that at sufficiently small values of @xmath15 and arbitrary values of @xmath0 the external magnetic field induces the rearrangement of the model vacuum : at @xmath12 it is chirally invariant , but the chiral symmetry breaking is induced at @xmath14 ( magnetic catalysis effect @xcite ) . due to the zero baryonic density it is the vacuum phase b. at larger values of @xmath15 the dense chirally symmetric phase a with massless quarks",
    "is realized .",
    "as shown in @xcite , a first order phase transition occurs between the a and b phases .",
    "now one can easily check that the stability condition ( [ stab ] ) of the present paper is fulfilled at @xmath211 , @xmath14 , too . hence , in this case stable droplets , composed from massless quarks , are allowed to exist .",
    "these droplets are surrounded by the chirally noninvariant vacuum . in papers",
    "@xcite the parameter @xmath67 was fixed in such a way , that @xmath212 ( see fig . 1 of the present paper ) , i.e. at @xmath12 the quark matter is not stable in this case . then , a rather complicated phase portrait was shown to exist in the @xmath146-plane . a more detailed analysis results in the statement that the stability constraints ( [ stab ] ) can be solved for these values of model parameters as well ( in a similar way , as in the case @xmath157 ) .",
    "hence , at @xmath14 , in contrast to the @xmath213 case , stable quark droplets are allowed to exist in the framework of njl model ( 1 ) for all values of the coupling constant @xmath214 : at @xmath5 this property is induced by an external magnetic field , whereas at @xmath1 it is an own property of the model .",
    "it might seem that at @xmath182 and @xmath14 the solution of the quark matter stability problem is qualitatively the same as at @xmath12 . however , there are some peculiarities which can be found by an energetical consideration of this problem .",
    "analogously to the case at @xmath12 @xcite , let us define the energy density @xmath215 at @xmath14 by the following relation @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the baryonic density and @xmath138  the dynamical quark mass in the vacuum phase b. a very important physical quantity is @xmath218  the energy per one baryon .",
    "at @xmath12 the graph of this function vs @xmath6 is presented on fig . 6 for @xmath219 and @xmath105 mev",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute minimum of this function lies at the point @xmath220 which is equal to the baryonic density inside stable quark droplets . at the point",
    "@xmath221 there is a local minimum of @xmath218 , corresponding to the real empty physical qcd - vacuum , i.e. to the phase b. due to the configuration of the curve @xmath218 vs @xmath6 at @xmath12 , one can conclude that the vacuum , i.e. the state with @xmath221 , is a metastable one .",
    "it means that not for all values of baryon density fluctuations the system will pass automatically to the mixed phase with stable quark droplet formation .",
    "indeed , the curve @xmath222 has a local maximum at some point @xmath223 .",
    "so , if a quark droplet with @xmath224 is created in the vacuum , it is energetically favorable for the system to reach zero density , i.e. to let tend the volume of the quark droplet to infinity thus pushing out all quarks from the system . as a result ,",
    "one gets the initial empty vacuum .",
    "however , if a quark droplet with @xmath225 is formed , then it will be a stable one , since in this case the droplet simply changes its volume in order to reach the most energetically favorable density @xmath226 .",
    "the situation is essentially different in the presence of an external magnetic field . in this case",
    "the graph of the function @xmath222 has a local maximum in the point @xmath221 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , so at arbitrary small baryonic density fluctuations the stable quark droplets will appear in the system . a similar property of the function @xmath222 is observed for the case @xmath157 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) as well as for other values of the parameter @xmath67 . hence , the external magnetic field promotes the creation of the stable quark matter .",
    "let us denote the global minimum point of the function @xmath227 as @xmath228 ( this value is the baryonic density inside the stable quark droplets ) .",
    "then , the binding energy per quark @xmath229 inside stable droplets is given by the relation latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } e_b\\equiv -\\left ( \\left.\\frac{\\varepsilon}{n_c\\rho}\\right    where @xmath160 .",
    "of course , both quantities @xmath229 and @xmath228 depend on @xmath0 .",
    "their graphs are presented on fig .",
    "[ ensv ] and fig .",
    "[ dens ] , respectively .",
    "recall , that in the case @xmath219 the quark binding energy @xmath229 is about @xmath231 mev at @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now one can easily see from fig .",
    "[ ensv ] that at nonzero @xmath0 this quantity might be several times larger , than at @xmath12 .",
    "so , the external magnetic field enhances the stability of quark matter .",
    "note that on fig .",
    "[ dens ] the density curve corresponding to the case @xmath219 has a cusp at the point @xmath232 .",
    "the matter is that in the chirally symmetric phase such quantities , as particle density , magnetization etc , have a discontinuity of their derivatives over @xmath15 and @xmath0 , when a new landau level is switched on @xcite . in the case under consideration in addition to the lowest landau level the first one for the @xmath114-quarks is brought into account just at the point @xmath233 , so the cusp for the density curve appears .",
    ". [ ensv ] , a cusp on the curve @xmath229 vs @xmath0 also appears at the point @xmath233 in the case @xmath219 , which is , however not so sharp .",
    "one can easily see a cusp on the curve @xmath37 vs @xmath0 of fig .",
    "4 as well . ) of course , the smaller the lowest value of the @xmath0-interval which is taken into account , the more cusps will appear on the density curve as well as on the graphs of other physical quantities . at @xmath140",
    "there are infinitely many cusps on these curves , which results in the experimentally observed oscillating phenomena of corresponding physical quantities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in the present paper the role of an external magnetic field @xmath0 on the formation of stable quark matter droplets inside the chirally noninvariant vacuum is investigated in the framework of the simple njl model ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "earlier , the problem of quark matter stability was considered in terms of more general effective theories with four - fermionic interactions as well , but only at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus , we began our study with the case of a vanishing external magnetic field , too .",
    "moreover , we used the same thermodynamic approach for treating multiquark droplets as in @xcite . in this case ,",
    "any multiquark clump is imagined as a droplet of the dense quark phase of the system , which is surrounded by a chirally noninvariant vacuum phase , and there is thermal and chemical equilibrium between both phases .",
    "this qualitative picture can be transformed into a quantitative constraints ( [ stab ] ) on dynamical quark masses and the chemical potential at which the coexistence of two phases is possible . moreover ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that at some values of the physically acceptable model parameters ( coupling constants , cutoff parameter , etc ) the stability constraints ( [ stab ] ) are not fulfilled for the njl model at @xmath12 . in those cases stable multiquark droplets are forbidden , and the njl model is not applicable for the description of dense quark matter .",
    "in our paper we have in the first step obtained the general solution of the stability constraints ( [ stab ] ) at @xmath12 for the njl model considered above . here , we have considered only the physically interesting case , when @xmath234 , in which case chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken down and quarks acquire a dynamical mass @xmath67 ( at @xmath118 ) . due to the stationarity equation ( [ 13 ] ) , the quantities @xmath67 and @xmath2 ( at @xmath74 ) are in a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "thus , we find it convenient to use the value @xmath67 ( instead of @xmath2 ) as a model parameter ( if @xmath67 changes from 0 to @xmath235 , then @xmath2 monotonically increases from @xmath4 to @xmath235 ) .",
    "stable quark matter droplets inside the chirally noninvariant vacuum are then allowed in the model under consideration only at @xmath236 , i.e. at @xmath18 , and they are composed of massless quarks .",
    "notice also that in @xcite the stability problem was investigated only at three physically admissable sets of parameters : @xmath237 , @xmath103 mev ( set 1 ) , @xmath104 , @xmath105 mev ( set 2 ) and @xmath106 , @xmath238 mev ( set 3 ) .",
    "there it was pointed out that for set 1 stable quark droplets are forbidden , but for sets 2 and 3 stable quark matter is allowed to exist . of course",
    ", these results coincide with our ones at @xmath12 .",
    "next , we took into account an external magnetic field and studied the problem of quark matter stability in detail at the same values of the parameter @xmath67 as in ref.@xcite .",
    "it turns out that at any value of @xmath0 in the cases @xmath182 stable quark droplets are allowed to exist .",
    "moreover , as at @xmath12 , these multiquark droplets consist of massless quarks . which are greater , but quite near to @xmath92 ( [ 17 ] )",
    "( for example , at @xmath239 ) , there exists a finite interval of the external magnetic field values , where stable quark droplets are formed by massive quarks .",
    "but for values of the external magnetic field outside of this interval , stable multiquark droplets are composed of massless quarks . ]",
    "the most interesting results were obtained in the case @xmath157 , where we have found that an external magnetic field induces stable quark matter formation .",
    "indeed , at @xmath12 multiquark droplets are not stable in this case .",
    "however , at @xmath14 they are allowed to exist .",
    "furthermore , there exists a value of magnetic fields , @xmath23 gauss , such that at @xmath193 quark droplets are formed by _ massive _ quarks . at @xmath192 ,",
    "multiquark droplets are composed of massless quarks .",
    "we have also checked that in a similar way , for other values of @xmath67 from the interval @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , stable quark droplet formation is also induced by the external magnetic field .",
    "note that one can even assert that at @xmath14 stable quark droplets are allowed to exist in the initial njl model at _ arbitrary _ values of the coupling constant @xmath214 . at @xmath1",
    "it is the native property of this theory even at @xmath12 , but at @xmath5 the stability of the quark matter is induced ( catalized ) by the external magnetic field .",
    "moreover , using an energetical approach , we have shown that an external magnetic field promotes the creation as well as enhances the stability of quark droplets at @xmath1 .",
    "finally , let us add some remarks about the role of color superconductivity ( csc ) in the quark matter stability problem considered above .",
    "this phenomenon was predicted quite recently in the framework of instanton - induced- as well as njl - type models with four  fermionic interactions ( see the reviews @xcite or some of the recent papers @xcite and references therein ) . at zero temperature",
    "it is proved that csc must exist at asymptotically large values of the chemical potential ( or baryonic densities ) , however , the lower boundary for this effect is not established up to now . in particular , in @xcite csc was investigated just in a slightly extended version of the njl model ( 1 ) at neighboring to the set 1 values of parameters , i.e. for @xmath240 and @xmath103 mev , but with an additional four - quark term included , which is responsible for the interactions in the diquark channel ( with a corresponding coupling constant @xmath241 ) .",
    "it was realized at @xmath12 , that usually with growing value of @xmath15 , the chiral invariance of the system is restored before or just at the csc phase transition .",
    "moreover , at fixed @xmath2 , the parameters of the csc phase transition strongly depend on the value of @xmath242 , while the features of the chiral phase transition do not seriously depend on @xmath243 .",
    "for example , in the njl model ( 1 ) at small values of @xmath244 the transition to the csc phase occured at @xmath245 mev , but at @xmath246 it is at @xmath247 mev , whereas for wide interval of @xmath243-values ( @xmath2 is fixed ) the chiral symmetry is restored at @xmath247 mev @xcite .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have put @xmath248 in our consideration of the quark matter stability problem at @xmath14 . in the light of the above discussion",
    "we believe that our results are not qualitatively changed at least for small values of @xmath243 , i.e. in the case , where csc occurs for rather large values of @xmath245 mev @xcite .",
    "in fact , in this case csc can not seriously influence stable quark droplet formation which takes place at values of the chemical potential much less than @xmath249 mev ( see the graphs of @xmath37 on figs 3 - 5 ) .",
    "at present time there are several indications on the possibility for csc to take place only at chemical potential values which indeed are outside the scope of our consideration , i.e. at @xmath250 mev : i ) the csc phenomenon was not discovered up to now in heavy ion collision experiments , ii ) it was argued in @xcite that two - flavor csc is absent inside quark cores of neutron stars , where baryonic density is several times the density @xmath110 of ordinary nuclear matter , iii ) in @xcite it was shown that due to the color meissner effect as well as due to the presence of background chromomagnetic fields ( gluon condensate ) the csc is shifted to higher densities ( chemical potentials ) , iv ) as in the case with ordinary superconductivity , the sufficiently strong external magnetic field prevents a system from csc as well etc . in these cases",
    "the ordinary , i.e. without csc , quark matter might be formed at rather low densities . to describe such a processes one could use models of the type ( 1 ) with zero or very small value of the diquark channel coupling constant @xmath241 .",
    "recently , we have studied already the magnetic catalysis of the quark droplet stabilization in the scope of a simpler one - flavor njl model @xcite .",
    "next , we are planning to consider the quark matter stability problem in more realistic njl models including vector interactions as well as the third flavor of quarks etc .",
