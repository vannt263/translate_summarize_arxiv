    "the correlation hole as seen in the fourier transform of the stick spectrum of a closed hamiltonian quantum system is particularly sensitive to long range spectral correlations , typical for random matrix models .",
    "this behavior in turn is indicative of chaos in the classical equivalent of the system via the quantum chaos conjecture @xcite .",
    "extensive work on the detection of such correlations using the correlation hole has been done in molecular physics @xcite , nuclear physics @xcite , and in the analysis of spectra from microwave cavities @xcite and optical resonators @xcite . as the energy spectrum often is not available , jost and lombardi",
    "have early focused attention on the analysis of intensity spectra ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath0 of the intensity spectrum @xmath1 for a system with eigenenergies @xmath2 and a state with amplitudes @xmath3 yields @xmath4 the inverse participation ratio @xmath5 is @xmath6 for a random state .",
    "averaging over a gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) in the large @xmath7-limit leads to @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the dimension of the matrices and @xmath9 is the two - point form factor of the goe @xcite . for the corresponding stick spectrum @xmath10",
    "is obtained instead . for intensity",
    "spectra the correlation hole is thus reduced to @xmath11 of its full value .",
    "this reduction makes the detection of the correlation hole difficult .",
    "reference  @xcite discusses different ways to overcome this basic problem , which becomes more acute if cross sections are considered .",
    "indeed , in the case of cross sections , the use of auto - correlation functions was shown to be of very limited efficiency .",
    "the cross correlations of independent intensity spectra , by contrast , display the full correlation hole .",
    "indeed , performing the goe average we find , instead of an inverse participation ratio , the product of two vector norms , i.e. @xmath12 where @xmath13 refers to the component of the second state",
    ". therefore the cross correlation behaves as @xmath10 .",
    "this simple fact has led to a detailed study of the possibility to observe the correlation hole in correlation functions of total and partial cross sections @xcite . to allow",
    "a comparison with regular systems , the poisson orthogonal ensemble ( poe ) was used .",
    "it combines random , statistically independent eigenvalues @xcite with orthogonally invariant eigenvectors @xcite . the poe does not have the universal implications of the goe , both because the assumptions about spectral statistics are less well founded , and because we easily may encounter situations of preferred coordinate systems .",
    "nevertheless , it is the best random matrix model for integrability that is available .",
    "indeed cross correlations prove to be the tool of choice to detect the correlation hole .",
    "clearly the main interest of such an analysis results when the total absorption , i.e. the sum over all transmission coefficients , is fairly large , which implies that the average total width @xmath14 is large compared to the mean level spacing @xmath15 .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the total cross sections of several normal - conducting microwave resonators with two antennas , obtained from measurements of the scattering matrix ( s - matrix ) via the optical theorem .",
    "the spectra of the studied systems exhibit different types of statistics , ranging from poe to goe behavior .",
    "the wall absorption is significant and either comparable to or much larger than the transmission of the antennas .",
    "this leads us from resonances with small overlap to such with very strong overlap .",
    "absorption channels are not directly accessible to experiments .",
    "our experiments address two interesting and quite general questions : on one hand , we test the use of cross - correlation functions to identify the effect of correlations in the spectrum of a chaotic hamiltonian in the case of overlapping resonances",
    ". the results of reference @xcite are compared with the data . on the other hand",
    ", we investigate whether absorption has to be included in terms of many weak or few strong channels , or whether the two cases can not be distinguished . for this purpose",
    "we extend the results of @xcite to include an infinite number of weak channels , which we shall show to cause an exponential decay of the correlation functions .",
    "in section 2 we recall some basics of random matrix scattering theory and some results of @xcite that are essential to our analysis , and we discuss the effect of a large number of channels with small absorption . in the following section the experimental setup and the studied billiards are explained . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we shall see that the signatures of chaos are more pronounced in the cross correlation than in the auto correlation .",
    "further we show that a description of absorption in terms of many channels is essential to obtain agreement with the experiment even in cases where the total absorption is of order one .",
    "there is an exact correspondence between the stationary classical wave equation of an ideal quasi - two - dimensional microwave cavity and the stationary schr \" odinger equation for a two - dimensional quantum billiard of the same shape .",
    "this correspondence includes the scattering situation , by taking the antennas explicitly into account @xcite , and ultimately even absorption phenomena .    the s - matrix for this situation is frequently used to describe resonant scattering arising e.g. in nuclear , atomic or mesoscopic systems @xcite : @xmath16 here",
    ", @xmath17 is the hamiltonian describing the closed billiard , and @xmath18 is a @xmath19 matrix , which couples the @xmath7 interior wave functions to @xmath20 decay channels . for each antenna",
    "we need one channel or column vector , where the components @xmath21 are proportional to the amplitude of the billiard eigenfunction at the position of the antenna , @xmath22 provided that the diameter of the antennas is small compared to the wavelength .",
    "this approximation may only be used in regions far from any thresholds , and the proportionality `` constant '' typically varies slowly with frequency @xcite .",
    "if symmetry - equivalent positions of the antennas are avoided , then typically the column vectors of @xmath18 are approximately orthogonal to each other . though not essential , this assumption simplifies the theoretical analysis .",
    "it is convenient to work in the eigenbasis of the closed system @xmath23 .",
    "then the scattering matrix depends on the eigenvalues of @xmath23 and on the coupling amplitudes , defined in equation  ( [ defvja ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the experiment is carried out in the framework of random matrix theory , where chaos is represented by a goe and integrability by a poe .",
    "the two ensembles differ only in the distributions of the eigenvalues , while orthogonal invariance implies in both cases that the columns of the matrix @xmath18 are distributed according to the invariant measure of the orthogonal group . in practice",
    "we use independent random gaussian variables for the matrix elements , an approximation which becomes valid for large @xmath7 .",
    "we first present some elementary results of scattering theory using the notation of @xcite . from equation  ( [ defs ] )",
    "the cross sections are derived as @xmath24 note that the experimental setup allows to measure @xmath25 directly .",
    "this avoids the difficulties related to the measurement of total cross sections .",
    "the optical theorem establishes a linear relation between the s - matrix elements and the total cross sections : @xmath26    the first quantity to study is the average s - matrix .",
    "the average can be a spectral average ( denoted by @xmath27 ) , an ensemble average @xmath28 , or a combination of both .",
    "for the average s - matrix all these averages must coincide .",

    "it should be large compared to the average level distance @xmath15 but sufficiently small so that the average s - matrix may be assumed constant .",
    "note that due to the optical theorem ( [ optthm ] ) the correlation function between total cross sections is equal to the correlation function between the corresponding s - matrix elements : @xmath37(t )     = \\hat c[s_{aa},s_{bb}^*](|t| ) \\ ; . \\label{csigtot}\\ ] ] for the goe the correlation function can be calculated exactly , as will be shown below . for the general case we rely on the rescaled breit - wigner approximation ( rbwa ) @xcite .",
    "the rescaling is necessary , as soon as the transmission coefficients are not extremely small . in the standard breit - wigner approximation",
    ", the average width of the resonances is given by : @xmath38 yet ericson showed that in the limit of many channels of comparable coupling strength , the correlation function of s - matrix elements or cross sections is proportional to @xmath39 . according to this derivation @xcite @xmath40 should be equal to @xmath41 , but actually @xmath42 gives the correct value for the correlation width .",
    "the two expressions coincide only in the limit where @xmath43 .",
    "thus the standard breit - wigner approximation is not valid in the range we are interested in .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that the rescaling @xmath44 compensates for this defect up to rather strong overlaps @xcite .",
    "the rescaled breit - wigner approximation has already been applied in the regime of non - overlapping resonances @xcite , but without mentioning the difference to the usual breit - wigner result . in the case of the correlation functions  ( [ csigtot ] )",

    "the cross correlation was expected to display the difference between integrable and chaotic systems more clearly than the auto correlation .",
    "indeed , our experiments confirm that the correlation hole is more pronounced in the cross - correlation function .    due to the optical theorem ,",
