    "nasa s _ kepler _ mission has discovered @xmath4 planet candidates ( as of may 2016 ) , about half of which are confirmed planets ( e.g. mullally et al .  2015",
    "; coughlin et al .  2016 ; morton et al .  2016 )",
    ". most of these planets are super - earths or sub - neptunes ( with radii 1.2 - 3@xmath5 ) , and have orbital periods less than 200  days . among the @xmath6 kepler planetary systems , @xmath7 have one transiting planet , and @xmath8 have 2 - 7 transiting planets [ the number of systems with @xmath9 planets is @xmath10 for @xmath11 . the observed transit multiplicity distribution , @xmath12 , and its dependence on the sizes and periods of planets , contain useful information on the architecture of compact planetary systems , such as the true planet multiplicity , the mutual inclinations , and orbital spacings between adjacent planets . in general",
    ", there exists a degeneracy between these ( underlying ) quantities in producing the same @xmath13 .",
    "for example , larger planet spacings and mutual inclinations will raise the relative number of single - transit systems ( lissauer et al .",
    "2011 ; tremaine & dong 2012 ) .",
    "this degeneracy can be partially lifted by combining the statistics of @xmath13 with the result of rv surveys ( tremaine & dong 2012 ; figueira et al .",
    "2012 ) , or using the transit duration ratios of different planets orbiting the same star ( fabrycky et al .",
    "the general conclusion from a number of studies is that kepler compact planetary systems are flat , with the inclination dispersion of order a few degrees ( lissauer et al .",
    "2011 ; tremaine & dong 2012 ; figueira et al .",
    "2012 ; johansen et al .  2012",
    "; fang & margot 2012 ; fabrycky et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "it has been noted that models with a single mutual inclination dispersion ( e.g. in a rayleigh distribution ) fall short in explaining the large number of single - transit ( @xmath14 ) systems relative to multiple - transit ( higher-@xmath9 ) systems by a factor of two or more ( lissauer et al .",
    "2011 ; johansen et al .  2012 ; weissbein et al .  2012 ; ballard & johnson 2016 ) .",
    "this suggests that the kepler planetary systems may consist of at least two underlying populations with different architectures : the first has many ( @xmath15 ) planets with small ( @xmath16 ) mutual inclinations , and accounts for the majority of the @xmath17 systems ; the second has fewer planets or higher mutual inclinations , and accounts for a significant portion of the observed single - transit systems .",
    "this is the so - called `` kepler dichotomy '' .",
    "xie et al .  (",
    "2014 ) found that the multi - transit systems are more likely to exhibit detectable transit timing variations than the single - transit systems , suggesting that the former are more closely packed than the latter .",
    "morton & winn ( 2014 ) found that the obliquities of stars with a single transiting planet are systematically larger than those with multiple transiting planets ( see albrecht et al .",
    "2013 ) , again suggesting that a substantial fraction of kepler s single - transit systems are dynamically hotter than the flat multiple - transit systems .",
    "the origin of the kepler dichotomy is unknown .",
    "the observed kepler multi - planet systems appear to be tightly packed and close to the edge of instability ( fang & margot 2013 ; pu & wu 2015 ; volk & gladman 2015 ) .",
    "thus a dichotomy in planetary architectures may arise from the long - term evolution of dynamically full systems . in this picture",
    ", the more densely packed systems underwent dynamical instability , leading to planet collision / consolidation and the formation of kepler `` singles '' ( pu & wu 2015 ; volk & gladman 2015 ) .",
    "it is unclear to what extent dynamical instability can account for the kepler dichotomy quantitatively , as the observed kepler multi s are sufficiently `` cold '' and not massive enough to experience appreciable inclination excitation or dynamical instability within the stellar lifetime ( johansen et al .",
    "2012 ; becker & adams 2016 ) . on the other hand , the kepler dichotomy may have a primordial origin , and results from the in - situ assembly of planetesimal disks ( hansen & murray 2013 ) with different masses and density profiles ( moriarty & ballard 2015 ) . in this paper",
    "we study the excitation of mutual inclinations in a compact multi - planet system by an external giant planet or stellar companion ( sections 2 and 3 ) . in general , the giant planet may be on a misaligned orbit relative to the inner planetary system , as a result of warp in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , foucart & lai 2011,2014 ) or strong scatterings between multiple giants ( juric & tremaine 2008 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "a distant stellar companion may also be inclined because of its misaligned orbital angular momentum at birth ( e.g. hale 1994 ) . by exciting mutual inclinations of the inner planets ,",
    "the giant planet can `` heat up '' the inner multi - planet system , causing it to appear as a single - transit system .",
    "since @xmath18 of the solar - type stars are in binaries , it is not surprising that many exoplanetary systems ( including kepler planet candidates ) have been found to have external binary companions with a range of separations ( e.g. , baranec et al .",
    "there is observational evidence that relatively close - by stellar companions ( with separation @xmath19  au ) tend to reduce the planet formation efficiency ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2015a ; kraus et al .",
    "2016 ; ngo et al .",
    "wang et al .  ( 2015b ) found that @xmath20 of kepler multi s have stellar companions at separation 1 - 100  au , compared to @xmath21 for field stars in the solar neighborhood , suggesting that such companions can misalign or disrupt multi - planet systems . on the other hand ,",
    "rv surveys continue to reveal a population of giant planets at large distances ( @xmath22 a few au ) from their host stars ( e.g. , marmier et al .",
    "2013 ; feng et al .  2015 ; moutou et al .  2015 ; rowan et al .  2016 ; wittenmyer et al .",
    "2016 ; bryan et al .",
    "the keck survey suggests that about @xmath8 of solar - type stars could host gas giants within 20 au ( cumming et al .",
    "2008 ) , while harps finds that @xmath23 of such stars host giant planets with periods less than 10 years . because of the limited time span and the faint magnitudes of kepler stars , the current census of distant giant companions to kepler compact systems is rather incomplete",
    "nevertheless , a number of such long - period companions or candidates have been found using the transit method ( schmitt et al .",
    "2014 ; uehara et al .",
    "2016 ) and the rv method ( e.g. , kepler-48 , kepler-56 , kepler-68 , kepler-90 , kepler-454 ) ; a number of non-_kepler _ `` inner compact planets + giant companion '' systems have also been found ( e.g. , gj  832 , wasp-47 )  see section 4 for applications of our theory to some of these systems .",
    "bryan et al .",
    "( 2016 ) reported that about @xmath24 of one and two - planet systems discovered by rv have companions in the 1 - 20@xmath25 and 5 - 20  au range .",
    "all these results indicate that external ( @xmath26  au ) giant planet companions are common around hot / warm ( @xmath27  au ) planets , and may significantly shape the architecture of the inner planetary systems .",
    "we note that the possible role of external companions on compact planetary systems has often been noted ( e.g. lissauer et al .",
    "2011 ) and formal secular theories ( with various approximations ) suitable for such study have been presented before ( e.g. tremaine et al .",
    "2009 ; boue & fabrycky 2014 ) .",
    "our paper makes progress on this problem by deriving simple approximate analytic expressions ( in various limiting regimes ) , calibrated with numerical results ( sections 2 and 3 ) , that allow us to answer the question : given an inner planetary system , what are the mutual inclinations excited by an external perturber of mass @xmath0 , semi - major axis @xmath1 and inclination @xmath2 ? in general , a `` strong '' perturber ( with large @xmath3 ) with high @xmath2 leads to larger mutual inclinations in the inner planets . but",
    "our work also reveals that under some conditions , large mutual inclinations can be generated even for small @xmath2 ( @xmath28 ) because of secular resonances .",
