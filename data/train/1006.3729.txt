    "the characterization and modification of surfaces and nanostructures is one of the most pressing challenges of nanoscience these days . scanning probe microscopy ( spm )",
    "has already achieved outstanding performance in this field . in particular , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite are two leading experimental tools that have been used for this purposes .",
    "the first , sensing the tunneling current between a  probe and a sample , has been already converted to a standard technique widely used to image , characterize and modify objects at the atomic scale .",
    "however , universal application of this method is limited by the requirement of a  conductive sample to detect the tunneling current .",
    "this serious drawback is not an issue anymore for afm , which senses the force acting between the tip and the sample .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the latter method has been widely adopted in recent years , when the afm method became widespread in different scientific fields ( e.g. biology , chemistry and physics ) .",
    "further proliferation of spm methods is closely tied to a  detailed understanding of undergoing processes during imaging or manipulation . in particular , the tip - sample interaction is a key for a better control and interpretation of measurements .",
    "introduction of a  so - called qplus sensor @xcite allowed simultaneous detection of both tunneling current and forces .",
    "this approach opens up an advanced way to characterize objects at the atomic scale combining different detection signals at the same time .",
    "moreover , it provides a direct and precise way to study the relation between the chemical force and the tunneling current .",
    "this question has already received a  lot of attention from both theory @xcite and experiment @xcite .",
    "recently , simultaneous measurements of both atomic force and tunneling current with high precision have been reported @xcite .",
    "therefore it is evident we have come to the stage at which precise simultaneous measurements of the force and the current become the standard .",
    "this situation calls for deeper theoretical understanding of how the tunneling current and force behave in different interaction regimes . in particular , the question how both the tunneling current and the chemical force are correlated with each other has received certain attention and it is still not fully resolved @xcite .",
    "simultaneous acquisition of the electron current and the force between nanoscale objects would elaborate our knowledge of their physical and material properties and undergoing processes in atomic scale .",
    "indeed , direct comparison of these two quantities measured on single gold atom wires during a breaking process has already shed more light on the origin of conductance quantization in atomic nanowires  @xcite and the relation between their mechanical and transport properties .",
    "application of the technique would also bring valuable information about the binding mechanism and electron transport through a  single molecule anchored to metallic electrodes @xcite .",
    "very recently this kind of experiment has been already realized @xcite .",
    "devices integrating electrical and mechanical functionality on the nanoscale , so called nems ( nanoelectromechanical systems ) systems are another research area ( see e.g.  @xcite ) where the simultaneous measurement of the current and force could open new perspectives .    therefore , to understand the the correlation between force and current in atomic scale ,",
    "we provide here a  simple model . in this model ( i )",
    "we discus the implication of the strong interaction regime on the electron current through the tip - sample junction and ( ii ) we explain the relation between the chemical force and the tunneling current in the weakly interacting regime . in particular , we will show in this paper that the relation between the tunneling current and the chemical force can be used as an  indicator of the quantum degeneracy between the frontier electronic states of the tip and the sample involved in the electron transfer .",
    "the aim of this paper is to get more insight into the relation between the tunneling current and the chemical force arising during the formation of an  atomic contact between an spm probe and a  surface atom .",
    "we will introduce a simple model , describing both the electron tunneling and the interaction energy between two bodies representing the spm tip and the sample .",
    "we will denote the two quantum - mechanical systems corresponding to the two interacting bodies as @xmath6 .",
    "the systems are described by eigenfunctions @xmath7 , @xmath8 and eigenenergies @xmath9 , @xmath10 satisfying the schrdinger equation for the respective decoupled system @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "next , we will consider only the interaction between the two outermost atoms on the tip and the sample . indeed",
    ", this approximation can be justified by the exponential decay of wave - functions outside the surface , which limits the interaction between the two bodies to only the outermost atomic layers . in particular , recently reported single - atom chemical identification is based on strong locality of the chemical force , almost completely driven by the apex atom of the tip and the nearest surface atom @xcite .",
    "the same reasoning is also plausible for the tunneling current @xcite .",
    "we thus start with two decoupled systems , @xmath11 ( surface ) and @xmath12 ( tip ) , which can be described as follows : @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 are eigenenergies and orthonormalized wave functions of independent systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "in the first part of this section we will focus on the far distance regime , where both the tip and the sample are only weakly disturbed by the interacting potential . in this regime ,",
    "the electron transport through the gap is driven by the tunneling process . afterwards",
    ", we will discuss the close distance regime , in which strong coupling between the two systems , tip and sample , occurrs . in this regime ,",
    "three main factors influence the electron transport : ( i ) a contraction of the piezo distance between the tip and sample @xcite ; ( ii ) a change of local density of states due to the formation of the chemical bond between the tip and the sample @xcite ; and ( iii ) a multiple scattering effect of electrons in the gap @xcite . in general , there is no strict definition of a tip - sample distance demarcating these two regimes .",
    "nevertheless , the onset of the short - range chemical force and the deviation of the i - z curve from the exponential form are signatures of the strong interaction regime .      if the two systems are brought into contact , an overlap between wave - functions @xmath16 arises , giving non - zero probability to transfer an electron from one side to the other and vice versa .",
    "then the schrdinger equation of the coupled system has the following form : @xmath17 for simplicity , we consider the potential @xmath18 as a  sum of potentials @xmath19 that satisfy the condition @xmath20 .",
    "this condition minimizes an error introduced by the perturbation theory ( for detailed discussion see  @xcite ) . in the weakly interacting regime ,",
    "the tunneling current between two electrodes is commonly described by the bardeen approach @xcite within the second order perturbation theory :    @xmath21    or in an integral form : @xmath22 where the tunneling matrix @xmath23 is expressed via the bardeen surface integral in terms of unperturbed wave functions of the original systems @xmath16 : @xmath24          when the two systems are brought into a close contact and the short - range chemical bond between the tip and the sample is formed , the wave functions of both systems are strongly modified . in this regime ,",
    "a more sophisticated description of the electron transfer going beyond perturbation theory is required . usually , the formulation in terms of green s functions is the method of choice @xcite , where all multiple scattering events of an electron in the contact region are involved ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme_tunel ] ) .",
    "the conductance between the tip and sample at an energy level @xmath25 can be described within the landauer @xcite formalism as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the transmission function giving an electron propagation probability between the tip and sample at an energy @xmath25 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 define the transfer matrix from the left to the right electrode and vice versa .",
    "usually the transmission function is evaluated using the combination of ab initio calculations in a  local orbital basis and the green s function methods ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in a previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have shown that the conductance can be expressed in terms of an  effective coupling between the tip @xmath11 and the sample @xmath12 such as : @xmath30 we can express the effective coupling @xmath31 in a diagrammatic form ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme_tunel ] ) : @xmath32 @xmath33^{-1}t_{\\alpha,\\beta } \\label{eq : tab}\\ ] ] and similarly @xmath34^{-1}t_{\\beta,\\alpha } , \\label{eq : tba}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 are probabilities that an  electron will jump between tip ( @xmath11 ) and sample ( @xmath12 ) and vice versa ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme_tunel ] ) and @xmath36 is the retarded / advanced green s function of the uncoupled tip or sample .",
    "( [ eq : geff ] ) can be further simplified .",
    "first , we will consider the electron transport at the fermi level @xmath37 as this is close to the conditions of experimental measurements on metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "the expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tab ] ) and ( [ eq : tba ] ) can be further simplified adopting a so - called wide band approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "the real part of the green s function tends to zero and only the imaginary part of the green s function dominates .",
    "therefore , using a  relation @xmath38 , we can recast the expression of the conductance as follows : @xmath39 now , the transmission function is a function of three variables : the hopping @xmath40 and the density of states of the tip @xmath41 and the sample @xmath42 .",
    "next , we will find suitable expressions for these three parameters so as to get more insight into the dependence of the transmission function @xmath27 on them .",
    "based on our previous arguments about the exponential decay of the wave function and its strong spatial localization , we will restrict ourselves to the electron transport between the surface adatom and the tip apex .    in order to provide the detailed analysis of the transmission function dependence on different factors ,",
    "we need to define the hopping elements between the frontier orbitals of the tip and sample .",
    "several authors @xcite made an attempt to find an analytical formula for the hopping elements . here",

    "@xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distance between the tip and sample , the exponent @xmath45 depends on orbital symmetry associated with the angular momentum quantum number ( for a  detailed discussion see @xcite ) and the variable @xmath46 means the apparent height of the barrier .",

    "this assumption allows us to express the transmission as a  function of a  single parameter @xmath54 . where the parameter @xmath54 is a  ratio between the hopping @xmath40 and the width of the electronic state @xmath48 @xmath55 using eqn .",
    "[ eq : kappa ] the transmission coefficient @xmath27 can be expressed in terms of @xmath54 as : @xmath56 furthermore , to keep our model as instructive as possible we adopt another condition .",

    "we also omit any modification of the surface density of states , i.e. , we consider @xmath42 or @xmath57 to be independent of the energy .",

    "the optimal condition for a transmission of an electron is achieved when the ratio @xmath54 tends to one , i.e.  @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , we can identify two limiting cases when the transmission function diminishes : ( i ) the tunneling regime in which @xmath59 as @xmath60 and ( ii ) the narrow band limit when the coupling parameter @xmath48 is negligible compared to the hopping @xmath40 .     on the parameter @xmath54 , which is the ratio between the coupling parameter ( or reciprocal density of states ) @xmath48 and the hopping @xmath40 .",
    "the inset shows a schematic view of a surface adatom coupling to the surface .",
    "the interaction represented by the hopping elements @xmath61 occurs via the localized state @xmath11 on the adatom and a surface band  @xmath62 . ]    on the other hand , the effect of the multiple scattering on the transmission function @xmath27 can be demonstrated by comparing the traditional bardeen approach , corresponding to the 2@xmath63 order perturbation theory , with an  exact solution that includes an  infinite series of scattering events . the numerator in eq .",

    "the discussion presented above is only a very basic picture of the electron transport between the tip and sample .",
    "one should always keep in mind , that there are other parameters affecting the electron transfer through the tunneling barrier .",
