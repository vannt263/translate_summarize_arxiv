    "quantum information has disclosed a modern approach to both quantum mechanics and information theory @xcite . very recently , this field has been developed into the so - called continuous variable  setting , where information is encoded and processed using quantum systems with infinite dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "bosonic systems , such as the radiation modes of the electromagnetic field , are today the most studied continuous variable systems , thanks to their strict connection with quantum optics . in the continuous variable framework , a wide range of results have been successfully achieved , including quantum teleportation  @xcite , teleportation networks  @xcite and games  @xcite , entanglement swapping protocols  @xcite , quantum key distribution  @xcite , two - way quantum cryptography  @xcite , quantum computation  @xcite and cluster quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "other studies have lead to the full classification of gaussian channels and collective gaussian attacks  @xcite , the computation of secret - key capacities and their reverse counterpart  @xcite , and possible schemes for quantum direct communication  @xcite .",
    "one of the key resources in many protocols of quantum information is quantum entanglement . in the bosonic",
    "setting , quantum entanglement is usually present under the form of einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) correlations  @xcite , where the quadrature operators of two separate bosonic modes are so correlated to beat the standard quantum limit  @xcite .",
    "the simplest source of epr correlations is the two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state . in the number - ket representation this state",
    "is defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the squeezing parameter and @xmath2 is an arbitrary pair of bosonic modes , that we may call signal  and idler . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 quantifies the signal - idler entanglement and gives the mean number of photons @xmath3 in each mode .",
    "since it is entangled , the tmsv state can not be prepared by applying local operations and classical communications ( loccs ) to a couple of vacua @xmath4 or any other kind of tensor product state .",
    "for this reason , the tmsv state can not be expressed as a classical mixture of coherent states @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 arbitrary complex amplitudes .",
    "in other words , its p - representation  @xcite@xmath8 involves a function @xmath9 which is non - positive and , therefore , can not be considered as a genuine probability distribution . for this reason ,",
    "the tmsv  state is a particular kind of nonclassical  state .",
    "other kinds are single - mode squeezed states and fock states . by contrast",
    "a bosonic state is called classical  when its p - representation is positive , meaning that the state can be written as a classical mixture of coherent states .",
    "thus a classical source of light is composed by a set of @xmath10 bosonic modes in a state@xmath11 where @xmath9 is positive and normalized to @xmath12 .",
    "typically , classical sources are just made by collection of coherent states with amplitudes @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 which corresponds to have @xmath15 in other situations , where the sources are particularly chaotic , they are better described by a collection of thermal states with mean photon numbers @xmath16 , so that@xmath17 more generally , we can have classical states which are not just tensor products but they have ( classical ) correlations among different bosonic modes .",
    "the comparison between classical and nonclassical states has clearly triggered a lot of interest .",
    "the main idea is to compare the use of a candidate nonclassical state , like the epr state , with all the classical states for specific information tasks .",
    "one of these tasks has been the detection of low - reflectivity objects in far target regions under the condition of extremely low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "this scenario has been called quantum illumination  and has been investigated in a series of papers  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the epr correlations have been exploited for a completely different task in a completely different regime of parameters . in the model of quantum reading",
    "@xcite , the epr correlations have been used to retrieve information from digital memories which are reminiscent of today s optical disks , such as cds and dvds .",
    "a digital memory can in fact be modelled as a sequence of cells corresponding to beam splitters with two possible reflectivities @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( used to encode a bit of information ) . by fixing the mean total number of photons",
    "@xmath20  irradiated over each memory cell , it is possible to show that a non - classical source of light with epr correlations retrieves more information than any classical source  @xcite .",
    "in general , the improvement is found in the regime of few photons ( @xmath21 )  and for memories with high reflectivities , as typical for optical memories . in this regime ,",
    "the gain of information given by the quantum reading can be dramatic , i.e. , close to @xmath12 bit for each bit of the memory .",
    "an important point in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the quantum - classical comparison is performed under a global energy constraint , i.e. , by fixing the total number of photons @xmath20  which are irradiated over each memory cell ( on average ) . under this assumption , it is possible to construct an epr transmitter , made by a suitable number of tmsv states , which is able to outperform _ any _ classical source composed by _ any _ number of modes . in the following we consider a different and easier comparison : we fix the number of signal modes irradiated over the target cell ( @xmath22 ) and the mean number of photons _ per signal mode _ ( @xmath23 ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "we compare an epr transmitter with a classical source .",
    "then , for fixed @xmath23 , we determine the critical number of signal modes @xmath24 after which an epr  transmitter with @xmath25 @xmath24 is able to beat any classical source ( with the same number of signals @xmath22 ) .",
    "here we briefly review the basic readout mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite , specifying the study to the case of a local energy constraint .",
    "let us consider a model of digital optical memory ( or disk ) where the memory cells are beam splitter mirrors with different reflectivities @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 ) .",
    "in particular , the bit - value @xmath28 is encoded in a lower - reflectivity mirror ( @xmath29 ) , that we may call a _ pit _ , while the bit - value @xmath30 is encoded in a higher - reflectivity mirror ( @xmath31 ) , that we may call a _ land _ ( see  fig .  [ qreadpic ] ) .",
    "close to the disk , a reader aims to retrieve the value of the bit @xmath32 which is stored in each memory cell . for this sake",
    ", the reader exploits a transmitter ( to probe a target cell ) and a receiver ( to measure the corresponding output ) . in general , the transmitter consists of two quantum systems , called _ signal _ @xmath33 and _ idler _ @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the signal system @xmath33 is a set of @xmath22 bosonic modes which are directly shined on the target cell .",
    "the mean total number of photons of this system is simply given by @xmath35 , where @xmath23 is the mean number of photons per signal mode ( simply called energy , hereinbelow ) . at the output of the cell , the reflected system @xmath36 is combined with the idler system @xmath34 , which is a supplementary set of bosonic modes whose number @xmath37 can be completely arbitrary .",
    "both the systems @xmath36 and @xmath34 are finally measured by the receiver ( see  fig .",
    "[ qreadpic ] ) .",
    "encoding bit - value @xmath28 and @xmath31 encoding bit - value @xmath30 .",
    "* readout*. a reader is generally composed by a transmitter and a receiver .",
    "it retrieves a stored bit by probing a memory cell with a signal system @xmath33 ( @xmath22 bosonic modes ) and detecting the reflected system @xmath36 together with an idler system @xmath34 ( @xmath37 bosonic modes ) . in general , the output system @xmath36 combines the signal system @xmath33 with a bath system @xmath38 ( @xmath22 bosonic modes in thermal states ) .",
    "the transmitter is in a state @xmath39 which can be classical ( classical transmitter ) or non - classical ( quantum transmitter ) . in our work",
    ", we consider a quantum transmitter with epr  correlations between signal and idler systems.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    we assume that alice s apparatus is very close to the disk , so that no significant source of noise is present in the gap between the disk and the decoder .",
    "however , we assume that non - negligible noise comes from the thermal bath present at the other side of the disk .",
    "this bath generally describes stray photons , transmitted by previous cells and bouncing back to hit the next ones . for this reason ,",
    "the reflected system @xmath36 combines the signal system @xmath33 with a bath system @xmath38 of @xmath22 modes .",
    "these environmental modes are assumed in a tensor product of thermal states , each one with @xmath40 mean photons ( white thermal noise ) . in this model",
    "we identify five basic parameters : the reflectivities of the memory @xmath41 , the temperature of the bath @xmath40 , and the profile of the signal @xmath42 , which is given by the number of signals @xmath22  and the energy @xmath23 .    in general , for a fixed input state @xmath39 at the transmitter ( systems @xmath43 ) , alice will get two possible output states @xmath44 and @xmath45 at the receiver ( systems @xmath46 ) .",
    "these output states are the effect of two different quantum channels , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which depend on the bit @xmath49 stored in the target cell .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath50 , where the conditional channel @xmath51 acts on the signal system , while the identity channel @xmath52 acts on the idler system .",
    "more exactly , we have @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a one - mode lossy channel with conditional loss @xmath55 and fixed thermal noise @xmath40 . now",
    ", the minimum error probability @xmath56 affecting the decoding of @xmath32 is just the error probability affecting the statistical discrimination of the two output states , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , via an optimal receiver .",
    "this quantity is equal to @xmath57/2 $ ] , where @xmath58 is the trace distance between @xmath44 and @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the value of @xmath56 determines the average amount of information which is decoded for each bit stored in the memory .",
    "this quantity is equal to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the usual formula for the binary shannon entropy . in the following ,",
    "we compare the performance of decoding in two paradigmatic situations , one where the transmitter is described by a non - classical state ( quantum transmitter ) and one where the transmitter is in a classical state ( classical transmitter ) .",
    "in particular , we show how a quantum transmitter with epr correlations ( epr transmitter ) is able to outperform classical transmitters .",
    "the quantum - classical comparison is performed for fixed signal profile @xmath42 .",
    "then , for various fixed values of the energy @xmath23 ( local energy constraint ) , we study the critical number of signal modes @xmath24 after which an epr transmitter ( with @xmath61 signals ) is able to beat any classical transmitter ( with the same number of signals @xmath22 ) .",
    "first let us consider a classical transmitter .",
    "a classical transmitter with @xmath22 signals and @xmath37 idlers is described by a classical state @xmath39 as specified by eq .",
    "( [ prepres ] ) with @xmath62 . in other words",
    "it is a probabilistic mixture of multi - mode coherent states @xmath63 .",
    "given this transmitter , we consider the corresponding error probability @xmath64 which affects the readout of the memory . remarkably , this error probability is lower - bounded by a quantity which depends on the signal profile @xmath42 , but not from the number @xmath37 of the idlers and the explicit expression of the @xmath9-function .",
    "in fact , we have  @xcite@xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fidelity between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the two possible outputs of the single - mode coherent state @xmath69 . as a consequence , all the classical transmitters with signal profile @xmath42",
    "retrieve an information which is upper - bounded by @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "now , let us construct a transmitter having the same signal profile @xmath42 , but possessing epr correlations between signals and idlers .",
    "this is realized by taking @xmath22 identical copies of a tmsv state , i.e. , @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "given this transmitter , we consider the corresponding error probability @xmath73 affecting the readout of the memory .",
    "this quantity is upper - bounded by the quantum chernoff bound @xcite@xmath74   ^{m } , \\label{qcb_qread}%\\ ] ] where @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath76 and @xmath77 are gaussian states , we can write their symplectic decompositions  @xcite and compute the quantum chernoff bound using the general formula for multimode gaussian states given in ref .  @xcite . then , we can easily compute a lower bound @xmath78 $ ] for the information which is decoded via this quantum transmitter .      according to our numerical investigation ,",
    "the quantum readout is generally more powerful when the land - reflectivity is sufficiently high ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) .",
    "for this reason , it is very important to analyze the scenario in the limit of ideal land - reflectivity ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "let us call ideal memory  a classical memory with @xmath87 .",
    "clearly , this memory is completely characterized by the value of its pit - reflectivity @xmath18 . for ideal memories , the quantum chernoff bound of eq .",
    "( [ qcb_qread ] ) takes the analytical form @xmath88^{2}+n_{b}(2n_{s}% + 1)(1-r_{0})\\}^{-m},\\ ] ] and the classical bound of eq .",

    ", we can study the behavior of the gain @xmath80 in terms of the remaining parameters @xmath91 .",
    "let us consider an ideal memory with generic @xmath92 in a generic thermal bath @xmath93 .",

    "this critical number can be defined independently from the thermal noise @xmath40 ( via an implicit maximization over @xmath40 ) .",
    "then , for a given value of the energy @xmath23 , the critical number @xmath24 is a function of @xmath18 alone , i.e. , @xmath94 .",

    "this means that , for ideal memories and low - energy signals , there always exists a finite number of signals @xmath24 above which the quantum readout of the memory is more efficient than its classical readout . in other words , there is an epr  transmitter with @xmath61 able to beat any classical transmitter with the same number of signals @xmath22 . in the considered low - energy regime",
    ", @xmath98 is relatively small for almost all the values of @xmath18 , except for @xmath104  where @xmath105 .",

    "apart from the divergence at @xmath99 , in all the other points @xmath92 , the critical number @xmath98 decreases for increasing energy @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ prlmin ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath110 photon , we have @xmath111  for most of the reflectivities @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , for energies around one photon , a single tmsv state is sufficient to provide a positive gain for most of the ideal memories .",
    "however , the decreasing trend of @xmath98 does not continue for higher energies ( @xmath112 ) .",

    ", we have a second asymptote appearing at @xmath101 ( see appendix  [ app2 ] for details ) .",
    "this means that the use of high - energy signals ( @xmath100 ) does not assure positive gains for memories with extremal reflectivities @xmath101 and @xmath87 .",
    "in conclusion , we have considered the basic model of digital memory studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is composed of beam splitter mirrors with different reflectivities . adopting this model ,",
    "we have compared an epr transmitter with classical sources for fixed signal profiles , finding positive information gains for memories with high land - reflectivities ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "analytical results can be derived in the limit of ideal land - reflectivity ( @xmath87 ) which defines the regime of ideal memories . in this case , by fixing the mean number of photons per signal mode ( local energy constraint ) , we have computed the critical number of signals after which an epr  transmitter gives positive information gains . for low - energy signals ( @xmath116 photons )",
