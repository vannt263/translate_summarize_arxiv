    "recent years have seen growing interest in coherent energy transfer . for instance , it has been pointed out that photosynthesis might benefit from quantum mechanical features of the transfer of excitations created by the incoming solar energy @xcite .",
    "a series of papers has modelled coherent dynamics in the light - harvesting system of the photosynthetic unit showing that the coupling to an environment does not necessarily destroy all coherent features  even at room temperature  but also can support the coherent transfer of excitations @xcite .",
    "the majority of these studies use the lindblad form of the liouville von neumann equation ( lvne ) for the reduced density operator of the system where the environmental degrees of freedom have been traced out @xcite . however , this approach is only valid in a limited parameter range of the coupling to the environment .",
    "in contrast , rapid experimental advances allow to manipulate and control ultra - cold atoms to a large extent .",
    "this offers the possibility to study coherent transport and the effect of environment changes ( e.g. , an increase in the temperature ) .",
    "an ideal system to study the dynamics of excitations are ( frozen ) rydberg gases @xcite , whose atoms can have complex spatial arrangements , for which the coherent dynamics can be efficiently modelled by continuous - time quantum walks @xcite .    moreover , it is possible to adjust the properties of specific ( `` special '' ) single atoms such that the excitation gets to be absorbed at these atoms @xcite . in this way",
    "they mimic the reaction center ( rc ) of photosynthesis , where the excitation gets trapped and further processed .",
    "both systems can be viewed as being donor - acceptor units , where the excitation is created at the donor ( `` normal '' rydberg atoms , light - harvesting complex ) and gets absorbed at the acceptor ( `` special '' rydberg atoms , rc ) .",
    "the decay of the excitation at the acceptor allows to globally monitor the transport dynamics .    while the lvne approach allows for a phenomenological modelling , other methods treat the system and the coupling to the environment in a microscopic manner .",
    "our method of choice is the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) technique , see , e.g. , @xcite , which can be applied for arbitrary system - environment coupling strengths .",
    "however , unlike the lvne approach , the real - time pimc method is plagued by the notorious dynamical sign problem  @xcite , which significantly limits the time scales accessible to pimc simulations .",
    "however , by combining the lvne and the pimc methods we are able to study excitation dynamics and trapping over large timescales and improve the numerical accuracy of our results .",
    "our model system is a dimer , represented by two coupled two - level systems ( tls ) , one of which acting as trap , the dimer being coupled to the environment . by assuming not too strong couplings to the environment and a single initial excitation of one of the tls , one can map the two tls onto a single tls , if , without the trap , the probability of finding the excitation in the system is conserved @xcite .",
    "we note that various systems with , e.g. , radial symmetry and a trap in the center can effectively be mapped onto the dimer if initially the excitation is homogeneously distributed over the periphery @xcite .",
    "in general , we consider the hamiltonian of a network of @xmath0 nodes , where each node represents a single two - level system .",
    "let @xmath1 be the hamiltonian without traps .",
    "the accessible hilbert space is completely characterized by the basis states @xmath2 which are associated with excitations localized at the nodes @xmath3 . within a phenomenological approach ,",
    "the hamiltonian , which incorporates trapping of excitations at the nodes @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is non - hermitian and has @xmath0 complex eigenvalues , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) where @xmath10 , and @xmath0 right and @xmath0 left eigenstates , denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the transition probability from node @xmath13 to node @xmath14 is then given by @xmath15 so that the negative imaginary parts @xmath16 of @xmath17 determine the temporal decay .",
    "the mean survival probability @xmath18 of an excitation in the presence of @xmath19 trap nodes is a global property of the network and is defined as @xmath20 i.e. , @xmath18 is the average of @xmath21 over all initial nodes @xmath13 and all final nodes @xmath14 , neither of them being a trap node .",
    "the schrdinger equation can be recast into the liouville - von neumann equation ( lvne ) when considering the density operator @xmath22 . for hermitian hamiltonians @xmath1",
    "one has @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 $ ] is the commutator .",
    "now , for the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath25 one obtains @xmath26 - \\big\\{{\\bm\\gamma},{\\bm\\rho}\\big\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the anti - commutator .    introducing the coupling to the environment",
    "naturally complicates the situation .",
    "however , under certain conditions one can employ the so - called lindblad form of the lvne , where the lindblad operators specify the coupling @xcite .",
    "consider now lindblad operators which can be written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a fixed decay rate .",
    "assuming all rates to be equal , @xmath30 for all @xmath13 , the lvne reads @xmath26 -   \\big\\{{\\bm\\gamma},{\\bm\\rho}\\big\\ } - 2\\lambda   \\sum_j \\big(\\bm\\rho",

    "one has to bear in mind that eq .",
    "( [ lvne ] ) is an approximation with a limited range of validity : for a very large coupling strength @xmath31 , eq .",
    "( [ lvne ] ) leads to the quantum zeno limit rather than to a classical master / rate equation . in the following",
    "we will consider lindblad operators which are given by projection operators of the type @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "in the sequel we will consider a dimer which is coupled to an external bath .",
    "this system allows to solve eq .",
    "( [ lvne ] ) analytically and , moreover , to compare the approximate lvne results to the numerically exact pimc calculations .",
    "the hamiltonian of the dimer without any coupling to the surroundings can be expressed through the pauli matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the onsite energy , which we choose to be the same for both nodes , and @xmath41 is the coupling between the two nodes .",
    "it is easily verified that the eigenvalues are @xmath42 where @xmath43 . for @xmath44 ( @xmath45 )",
    "this yields the correct eigenvalues @xmath46 of @xmath1 .",
    "note that for @xmath47 the negative imaginary part of @xmath48 is identical for both eigenvalues , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "the bi - orthonormalized eigenstates of @xmath25 are of the form @xmath50 and @xmath51 where the phases @xmath52 depend on @xmath53 such that in the limit @xmath44 one recovers the eigenstates of @xmath1 .",
    "we note , however , that finding the bi - orthonormal basis set is not necessary for the following calculations .",
    "one just has to require that the basis sets of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are orthonormal , respectively . in this way one",
    "diagonalizes @xmath54 and @xmath55 separately , which in the end leads to the same eigenvalues and eigenstates as the approach described above .",

    "one recovers the simple oscillatory behavior of the transition probabilities [ namely , @xmath65 . for @xmath66 ,",
    "i.e. , with coupling to the surroundings , the transition probabilities still show oscillations superimposed on an exponential decay in time which tends to the classical equipartition value of @xmath67 .    in order to combine the results of eq .",

    "( [ pi_l0 ] ) we obtain a product of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which is the simple oscillatory behavior of the dimer without trap .",
    "now , the coupling to the environment affects all transitions but still conserves probabilities .",
    "therefore , we replace the term @xmath70 by the expansion of eq .",

    "( [ lvne ] ) delivers satisfactory results .",

    "[ pimc_dimer](c ) , however , the approximate solution , eq .",
    "( [ pi_lr_approx ] ) , begins to deviate from the lvne and the pimc calculations , which are still in very good agreement .",
    "as the numerical effort of real - time pimc simulations grows exponentially with time , they can cover only short - to - intermediate timescales .",
    "however , the agreement between the lvne and the pimc calculations in the weak coupling regime allows to compensate for this shortcoming , by using at longer times the lvne results , see fig .",
    "[ pimc_dimer](d ) .    as mentioned earlier , strong couplings @xmath31 in the lvne lead to the zeno limit , and therefore disagree with the large - coupling / high - temperature behavior of the pimc formalism .",
    "figure  [ pimc_dimer](d ) shows @xmath18 for @xmath96 ( dashed - dotted line ) , which clearly deviates from the long - time behavior of the curves for small @xmath97-values .",
    "this corroborates the fact that the lvne in the lindblad form only yields the correct long - time behavior for rather weak couplings to the environment .    for @xmath98 and varying @xmath53 , fig .",
    "[ pimc_dimer_trapping ] compares @xmath18 obtained from the numerical solution of the lvne to the results of the corresponding pimc calculations .",
    "the trap is part of the system , i.e. , it directly enters the hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , unlike a change in @xmath97 , a change in @xmath53 leads to no significant differences for @xmath18 obtained from the two methods . nevertheless , varying the trapping strength has strong implications for the survival probability : at short times ( @xmath99 ) the survival probability @xmath18 is smaller for smaller @xmath53 . at larger times",
    "the decay is very pronounced for larger @xmath53-values ; smaller @xmath53-values do not dampen the oscillations which are superimposed on the decay .",
    "this effect will be weakened when increasing the coupling to the environment .",
    "finally , in the limit of very strong coupling to the environment , all coherences will be quickly destroyed and the resulting transport becomes purely incoherent .",
    "the dynamics is governed by a master equation whose transfer matrix is @xmath100 one obtains the parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 by fitting to the pimc calculations at large temperatures . in principle",
    "one can obtain the transfer rates @xmath102 from a golden rule approach @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath104 has purely real eigenvalues , @xmath105 similar to the coherent case , the eigenstates of @xmath104 read @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "now , the classical survival probability is readily obtained as @xmath108 which for not too small @xmath109 gives rise to a simple exponential decay with exponent @xmath110 .",
    "taking @xmath111 and @xmath112 one obtains @xmath113 , which is independent of @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we note the difference in the overall exponential decay of the lvne which was proportional to @xmath69 . comparing this to the pimc results for strong couplings @xmath97",
    ", we obtain @xmath114 .",
    "we have studied the trapping of excitations in dimers which are coupled to a dissipative environment . by using the ( approximative ) lindblad form of the lvne on one hand and the ( numerically exact ) pimc calculations on the other",
    ", we were able to specify the range of coupling parameters in which both methods agree with each other .",
    "moreover , matching the two approaches by appropriately adjusting the coupling parameter @xmath97 in the lvne allows to extrapolate the short - to - intermediate - time pimc result to  in principle  arbitrary long times .",
    "since pimc is numerically exact , the combination with the lvne is ideal for also studying large systems at long times for a broad range of couplings .",
