    "the desire for high spectral resolution observations in the near - infrared has been met with three main types of instrument .",
    "the traditional way of mapping an object at high spectral resolution is to use a long - slit cooled grating spectrograph , and step the slit across the sky .",
    "although this technique records data at every spectral point simultaneously , it is highly inefficient on extended objects if only a single wavelength ( or a small number of wavelengths ) are of interest .",
    "the fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) works by fourier transforming an interferogram produced by a two - beam interferometer , and can perform measurements over a large wavelength range ( e.g. , 0.9  5.5  @xmath2 m in the case of the cfht fts ; bohlender 1994 ) .",
    "the fts tends , however , to be mechanically large , complex , and expensive , and is also not very efficient for monochromatic applications .",
    "furthermore , every pixel has the noise from the entire continuum in it , and this noise is correlated from pixel to pixel .",
    "the fabry - perot interferometer , by contrast , is small , has a high throughput ( compared to a grating of comparable size and resolving power ; jacquinot 1954 ) , and can deliver consistently high spectral resolution over a wide field , which is imaged directly with an infrared array .",
    "fabry - perot etalons have been successfully employed for narrow - band imaging in the optical for many years ( e.g. , atherton et al .",
    "1982 ; bland & tully 1989 ; jones & bland - hawthorn 1997 ) . however , it is only the recent advent of low - noise , large - area detector arrays that has made their use as tunable narrow - band filters for the near - infrared particularly advantageous .",
    "there is clearly much to be gained by observing emission lines in the infrared ; for example , aside from the reduction in extinction relative to the optical regime , many rotational and vibrational transitions of molecules ( such as h@xmath5 ) also become accessible .",
    "although many of the brighter galactic sources can be imaged using filters with fixed , narrow ( @xmath6% ) bandpasses , the use of a fabry - perot etalon with resolving power @xmath7 confers a number of advantages , including    * the ability to resolve closely spaced lines , or resolve the line of interest from adjacent oh airglow or atmospheric absorption lines ; * the ability to reveal velocity gradients , or even a complete velocity field , when doppler motions exceed a few tens of ; * the reduced sky background and continuum flux passed to the detector .",
    "the resultant increase in the line - to - continuum ratio improves the measurement stability , and allows the sky to be sampled less often .    in this paper , we describe one such system , named   ( university of new south wales infrared fabry - perot ) , which is intended to complement the existing near - infrared imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of iris hgcdte array manufactured by rockwell international science centre , ca . ]",
    "( allen et  al . 1993 ) at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , but which could also function as a visiting instrument at other facilities ( e.g. , mssso 2.3  m , ukirt ) . in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief overview of fabry - perot systems , and  in particular .",
    "we then describe some of the novel approaches taken to calibrate  and process the resultant data , and give illustrations of some of the early scientific results obtained with .",
    "thorough discussions of the principles underlying the fabry - perot interferometer , and its use in astrophysics , can be found elsewhere ( e.g. , vaughan 1989 ; bland & tully 1989 ) , and only a few important definitions will be given here .",
    "in essence , the fabry - perot interferometer consists of a pair of identical transparent plates , having plane - parallel internal faces of reflectivity @xmath8 , separated by a uniform spacing @xmath9 .",
    "peak transmission is attained over a series of orders @xmath10 when    @xmath11    where @xmath2 is the refractive index of the medium between the plates , and @xmath12 is the angle relative to the normal of the incident beam with wavelength @xmath13 .",
    "the spectral distance between two adjacent orders @xmath10 and @xmath14 is called the free spectral range ( fsr ) , and is given by    @xmath15    for a `` perfect '' fabry - perot etalon , the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of each order is    @xmath16    thus the resolving power @xmath17 can be described as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is called the reflection finesse . in practice , the true `` effective '' finesse @xmath20 of a fabry - perot system is always less than the reflection finesse , due to surface defects in the coatings , departures from plate parallelism , and the use of a converging , rather than a parallel , incident beam . replacing @xmath19 with @xmath20 in equation  [ eq : rp ] then allows the resolving power to be estimated in the general case .",
    "table  [ t : fps ] summarises the specifications of some currently available near - ir imaging fabry - perot systems .",
    "as can be seen , various combinations of resolving power , field of view , and tuning range are available . the  etalon was specifically intended to meet the following goals :    1 .   a high resolving power ( @xmath21 ) ; this was a trade - off between the amount of spectral scanning required at high resolution to fully sample the line , and the reduced line - to - continuum contrast and velocity information available at lower resolution ; 2 .   a choice of pixel scales ( e.g. , @xmath22  pixel@xmath23 or @xmath24  pixel@xmath23 ,",
    "depending on the imaging optics selected within iris ) matched to the seeing conditions and the clear aperture of the etalon ; 3 .",
    "the ability to cover lines in both the @xmath25  band ( e.g. , [ feii ] at 1.6440  @xmath2 m ) and in the @xmath26  band ( e.g. , h@xmath27 at 2.1218  @xmath2 m , h@xmath28 at 2.2477  @xmath2 m , and br@xmath29 at 2.1655  @xmath2 m ) .",

    "is a highly versatile facility , as illustrated by some of the first science results achieved . since being commissioned in 1996  february",
    ", it has been awarded a total of 35  nights in its first 3  semesters on the aat . among the projects currently underway ( or planned )",
    "are :    * imaging and line - ratio mapping of supernova remnants , planetary nebulae , hii  regions , photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , and herbig - haro objects . * photometry and dynamics of starburst and seyfert galaxy nuclei . * studies of extinction in star formation regions . * the search for redshifted uv / optical emission from primeval galaxies .",
    "figure  [ f : kang ] was produced from some of the earliest data obtained with , and shows the emission from molecular hydrogen at 2.12  @xmath2 m from a photodissociation region not far from the `` keyhole '' nebula in carina .",
    "not surprisingly , this region has earned the ( unofficial ) designation of the `` kangaroo '' nebula .",
    "this image was produced using  in its line imaging filter mode , by subtracting a continuum image from a single image taken very near the line peak .",
    "is already helping to shed some light on the excitation mechanism for h@xmath5 in pdrs .",
    "figure  [ f : p18 ] is a map of the h@xmath31 / h@xmath32 intensity ratio in the reflection nebula parsamyan  18 , obtained from scans of the 2.12 and 2.25  @xmath2 m lines with  ( ryder et  al .",
    "values of the ratio @xmath33 over most of p  18 are indicative of uv - pumped fluorescence , while values approaching 7 or more in the areas marked `` 5 '' and `` 8 '' are consistent with an increased gas density and/or a contribution from shocks . the simultaneous velocity information provided by  has allowed us to show that region `` 8 '' is almost certainly excited by an outflow source close to p  18 , rather than being radiatively excited like the other regions .",
    "similar studies are also being carried out on the `` elephant trunks '' of m16 ( allen et  al .",
    "1998a ) , as well as the `` fingers '' emerging from the core of omc-1 ( figure  [ f : orion ] ; burton & stone 1998 ) .",
    "one avenue of research to which  is particularly well - suited is the excitation and dynamics of planetary nebulae , both young and evolved .",
    "figure  [ f : n3132 ] compares the morphology of ionised and warm molecular gas in ngc  3132 ( allen et al .",
    "a similar study of the h@xmath5 emission in very low excitation ( and therefore young ) planetary nebulae is also being conducted to complement an h@xmath34 snapshot survey with wfpc-2 on board the _ hst _ ( sahai & trauger 1996 ) .",
    "another area of research where  is beginning to make inroads is in the excitation and dynamics of active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies , normally heavily obscured by dust .",
    "figure  [ f : circvf ] shows the inner velocity field , derived from  scans of the h@xmath5  2.12  @xmath2 m line , in the circinus galaxy , which is the closest known type  2 seyfert galaxy .",
    "this has enabled the first direct measure of the rotational velocity gradient near the nucleus of the circinus galaxy , and allows us to put an upper limit on the mass of the central black hole of @xmath35  m@xmath36 ( davies et al .",
    "we have successfully developed and commissioned the university of new south wales infrared fabry - perot ( ) on iris at the aat . among the notable characteristics of this system , which is based on a queensgate et-70wf etalon , are its high resolving power ( @xmath37 ) , wide field ( up to @xmath1 ) , and ability to be tuned across almost the entire @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands .",
    "a novel method of _ in - situ _ wavelength calibration has been applied , and a new suite of reduction and analysis software in the iraf environment has been developed .",
    "early results across a wide variety of sources have been presented , and a number of diverse projects are now underway .",
