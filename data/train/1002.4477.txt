    "the population ii ch stars with their characteristic properties like iron deficiency and enhancement of carbon and s - process elements can provide strong observational constraints for the theoretical computation of nucleosynthesis at low metallicity .",
    "early - type extrinsic ch stars ( @xmath4c/@xmath5c @xmath610 ) are confirmed post - mass - transfer binaries ( mcclure & woodsworth 1990 ) in which the companion star is an agb that evolved to a now invisible white dwarf . the chemical composition of the early type ch stars that are characterized by enhancement of s - process elemental abundances bears signatures of the nucleosynthesis processes operating in low - metallicity companion agb stars , provided they conserve the surface characteristics of the companion stars .",
    "these stars thus form ideal targets for studying the operation of s - process at low metallicity .",
    "however , not many studies on ch stars can be found ; the few earlier studies available are either limited by the resolution or by the wavelength range .",
    "it is important to update the elemental abundances based on higher resolution spectra ; the results obtained for heavy elements zr , la , ce , nd with better spectra in a number of ch stars are found to be very different ( van eck et al .",

    "the star hd 209621 along with two other ch stars hd  5223 and hd  26 have been used as reference stars for studies on medium resolution spectroscopic analysis of candidate faint high latitude carbon stars from the hamburg / eso survey ( goswami 2005 , goswami et al .",

    "earlier studies on this object are limited by both resolution as well as wavelength regions .",
    "thus the nature of the distribution of the neutron - capture elements and their abundances for this star are necessary to justify its further use as a reference ch star ; the present work accomplished this using a high resolution subaru spectrum for this star .    estimated @xmath4c/@xmath5c @xmath8 10 ( tsuji et al . 1991 ) places hd  209621 in the group of early - type ch stars",

    "enhancement of pb abundance is noticed in a number of ch as well as cemp-(r+s ) stars .",

    "from the figure it is evident that pb shows a distinct trend with metallicity in these objects . from the similarity in the abundances , it is also likely that these objects form a group originating from a similar physical scenario .",
    "according to the cemp stars taxonomy of beers and christlieb ( 2005 ) , ( r / s ) stars are defined by limits on s - elements as [ ba / fe ] @xmath34 + 1.0 and r - element as [ ba / eu ] @xmath6 0.5 with [ eu / fe ] @xmath34 + 1.0 . a criteria [ ba / eu ] @xmath34 0.0 is set for ( r+s ) stars ( jonsell et al .",

    "elements for hd  209621 are plotted ( figure 6 ) along with the scaled abundance patterns of the solar system material , the main s - process component , and the r - process pattern ( arlandini et al .",
    "the abundance patterns of elements with 56 @xmath6 z @xmath6 63 agree with the s -process pattern much better than with the r - process pattern indicating that the neutron - capture elements in hd  209621 principally originate in the s - process .",
    "estimated [ ba / eu ] (= + 0.35 ) for hd  209621 is significantly lower than that seen in the main s - process component ( [ ba / eu ] = 1.15 , arlandini et al . 1999 ) .",
    "such low values for [ ba / eu ] were also noticed in stars cs  29526 - 110 , cs  22898 - 027 , cs  31062 - 012 , and cs  31062 - 050 ; the ratios [ ba / eu ] , for these objects range from 0.36 to 0.47 .",
    "the abundance patters of elements 56 @xmath6 z @xmath6 63 are however in agreement with the s - process pattern ( aoki ei al .",
    "the observed low values of [ ba / eu ] in the four cs stars are interpreted as a result of an s - process that produces different abundance ratios from that of the main s - process component ( aoki et al .",
    "this interpretation is supported by models of goriely & mowlavi ( 2000 ) that predicted [ ba / eu ] = 0.4 for yields of metal - deficient agb stars .",
    "a similar interpretation also seems applicable to hd  209621 ; the abundance pattern observed in hd  209621 as being produced by s - process although r - process contamination may have contributed to the observed eu excesses to some extent .",
    "analysis of the observed abundances of the heavy elements with parametric model function ( a ) also shows that s - process have slightly higher contributions with @xmath38 = 0.56 than r - process with @xmath39 = 0.51 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the component coefficients that correspond to contributions from the s- and r - process respectively . here , the contributions from r- and s - process are estimated from the fitting for ba - er .",
    "a widely accepted scenario for the formation of ch stars , known to be single - line spectroscopic binaries is the mass transfer from a companion agb star ( mcclure 1983 , 1984 and mcclure and woodsworth 1990 ) .",
    "temporal variations of radial velocities observed among the known ch stars indicate binarity of the objects . mcclure and woodsworth ( 1990 ) have noted the star hd  209621 to be a radial velocity variable with a period of 407.4 days . our estimated radial - velocity ( @xmath40390 @xmath41 1.5 km s@xmath10 ) also indicates that hd  209621 is a high - velocity star and a likely member of the galactic halo population .",
    "such high velocities are a common feature of ch stars",
    ". these properties also point towards the fact , that the observed enhancement of neutron - capture elements in hd  209621 resulted from a transfer of material rich in s - process elements across a binary system with an agb star . the abundance ratios of neutron - capture elements in hd  209621 shown by the present study underscores the need for detailed studies of a larger sample of ch stars in order to develop a comprehensive scenario for the production of heavy - elements by the s - process operating at low metallicity .",
    "such studies are also likely to provide with clues to the limit on the metallicity of stars that show double enhancement .",
