    "in this paper we have presented the _ swift _  observations of the high variable nls1 rxj0148.32758 .",
    "in addition to the strong x - ray flux variability , our main results are composed of the spectral changes .",
    "we observed a hardening followed by a softening of the spectrum of rxj0148.32758  over a time during which the x - ray flux was on a continual decrease .",
    "both types of spectral changes have been observed in agn , although the hardening of the x - ray spectrum with decreasing flux is more common ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , softening of the x - ray spectrum with decreasing flux has been reported on nls1s in e.g. , rx j2217.95941 @xcite , rx j0134.24258 @xcite , pks 0558504 @xcite , and 1h 0707495 @xcite .    a simple way to explain",
    "a hardening in the spectrum with decreasing observed x - ray flux is with a cold absorber cloud in the line of sight .",
    "variable absorbers in agn are often observed in seyfert galaxies , e.g. the seyfert 2 sample of @xcite , ngc 1365 @xcite , ngc 4388 @xcite , the seyfert 1.8 galaxy ngc 3786 @xcite the seyfert 1.5 galaxies ngc 4151 @xcite and ngc 3227 @xcite , or 1h0419577 @xcite .",
    "a variable cold absorber could also , in part , provide a plausible explanation for the spectral variability between the 2005 may and 2005 december 09 observation .",
    "as listed in table [ xrt_fit ] , we fitted an absorbed broken power law to the 2005 december 09 data , where all parameters were fixed to those determined from the may 2005 observations , except for the absorption column density and the normalization , which were allowed to vary .",
    "this provided a best - fit column density @xmath39=8.1@xmath21.4@xmath71 @xmath36 , although there were strong residuals below 0.5 kev .",
    "although nls1s often resemble agn with only minor intrinsic absorption , this is not a true picture in general ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a different result is found if all parameters are left to vary .",
    "as listed in table [ xrt_fit ] and shown in figure [ rxj0148_contour ] , @xmath39  actually becomes consistent with the galactic value and the soft x - ray spectral index @xmath0  flattens out .",
    "however , in a fitting routine like _ xspec _ , @xmath39  and the spectral index are not independent parameters . a larger value of the absorption column density @xmath39  will result in a steeper spectral index , and vice - versa . given the column density observed in december 20/21 , which was again in the order of 10@xmath72 @xmath36 , we can conclude that the spectral change seen between the 2005 may and 2005 december 09 observations is most likely due to an increase in the absorber column density .",
    "a soft x - ray spectrum fitted by a spectral model can mimic a low column density as shown by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , even though the real column density is much larger .    a softening with decreasing x - ray flux can be cause by several processes such as a change in the accretion disk corona ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the presence of a variable ionized absorber ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another possibility is the presence of a partial covering absorber as discussed for e.g. rx j2217.95941 @xcite , 1h 0707495 @xcite , and mkn 1239 @xcite . as an alternative",
    ", @xcite discussed the variability observed in 1h 0707495 in the context of x - ray reflection on an ionized disk .",
    "of all these models only the partial covering absorber model yields reasonable results .",
    "interestingly , the coverage fraction observed in 2005 may , 2005 december 09 , and december 20/21 observation remains the same , at around @xmath47=0.8 .",
    "the column density of the partial covering absorber follows the same trend as the cold absorber column density , suggesting that it is at a low value during the december 09 observation .    the soft x - ray slope @xmath0=2.58@xmath1 is rather steep even for a nls1 .",
    "the mean soft x - ray slope for the sample of 51 nls1s from @xcite is @xmath9=1.96 with a standard deviation @xmath21=0.41 , and @xmath9=2.1 for the sample taken from @xcite .",
    "however , the hard x - ray spectral slope of @xmath9=0.96@xmath73 is slightly flatter than that found in the sample of nls1s from @xcite , who found a mean hard x - ray slope of @xmath9=1.19@xmath20.10 and the sample from @xcite with @xmath9=1.15 .",
    "this is in better agreement with the values found for bls1 , for which @xcite found @xmath9=0.78@xmath20.11 and @xcite found @xmath9=0.87 .",
    "a possible explanation for this ` discrepancy ' is that whereas the soft x - ray spectral slope is driven by the eddington ratio @xmath70 , the hard x - ray spectral slope is more dependent on the black hole mass .",
    "the eddington ratio @xmath70 is one of the highest in the sample from @xcite , with @xmath70 = 4 .",
    "as shown by @xcite , nls1s with a high eddington ratio @xmath70 deviate significantly from the @xmath11 - stellar velocity dispersion @xmath21 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a fwhm([oiii])=700@xmath2500 and a black hole mass in",
    "the order of a few 10@xmath74@xmath66   rxj0148.32758  shows one of the most extreme deviations from the @xcite @xmath75 relation .",
    "rxj0148.32758  also shows a variation in its optical - to - x - ray spectral slope @xmath7 . while during the 2005 december 09 observations @xmath7=1.5 , during the december 20/21 observations rxj0148.32758  became x - ray weak with @xmath7=1.81 .",
    "similar changes in @xmath7   have also been recently reported by @xcite .",
    "changes like these can explain in part the large scatter seen in the @xmath7  diagrams of e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _   observations of rx j0148.32758 have shown the great potential of _ swift _  for agn science .",
    "the x - ray light curves are highly variable , in particular those of nls1s , and require long - term coverage in a range of wavelengths . due to its low - earth orbit , _ swift _  is very similar to _ rosat _ and _ asca _ , but has also the added advantage of being a multi - wavelength observatory .",
    "our study has shown the importance of simultaneous uv and x - ray observations over a time - span of days , and _ swift _  is the only observatory that can obtain such observations .",
    "our observations of rxj0148.32758  utilize the multi - wavelength capabilities of _ swift _  as well as its flexible observing scheduling .",
    "the simultaneous observations in the uvot and xrt allow us to measure the x - ray loudness @xmath7  directly without assuming any optical / uv spectral slopes .",
    "we are also able to measure the total power in the big blue bump and therefore the bolometric luminosity directly .",
    "the strong change in its spectrum between the 2005 may and 2005 december 09 observations prompted us to execute further observations , which took place a few days later , on december 20/21 .",
    "these additional observations allowed us to observe a hardening and a softening in the same source .",
