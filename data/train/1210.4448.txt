    "the two nearest galaxy clusters to us are virgo and fornax .",
    "the nasa extra - galactic database ( ned ) gives the distance of m87 ( the giant elliptical at the heart of virgo ) as 16.8 mpc , while the similar galaxy at the heart of fornax ( ngc1399 ) lies at 17.9 mpc .",
    "both clusters are at high galactic latitude ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and so are ideal targets for extra - galactic studies at all wavelengths .",
    "virgo and fornax were observed at optical wavelengths ( photographic ) in the 1980s leading to the most complete catalogues of cluster members ( binggeli et al .",
    "1985 , ferguson 1989 ) .",
    "fornax is somewhat less populous than virgo with just 350 members listed in the fornax cluster catalogue ( fcc , ferguson 1989 ) compared to about 2000 in the virgo cluster catalogue ( vcc , binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ) .",
    "the fornax cluster has a velocity dispersion of @xmath11 km s@xmath12 and a core radius of 0.7 deg ( 250 kpc ) , which gives a mass of @xmath13 m@xmath8 , about a factor of seven less than virgo ( jordan et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) and so fornax might also be described as a large group . like virgo",
    ", fornax does show evidence of sub - structure indicating its current and continuing assembly ( drinkwater et al . 2001 ) though it is more regular in shape and probably more dynamically evolved than virgo .",
    "although less massive than virgo , the central galaxy number density is about three times higher in fornax than in virgo and with its lower velocity dispersion we might expect more influential interactions of fornax galaxies with one another . to quantify this the relaxation time of fornax , a measure of the time scale for gravitational interactions ,",
    "is about one third that of virgo ( @xmath14 years , boselli and gavazzi , 2006 ) .",
    "however , this timescale is long compared to the crossing time which determines how long a mechanism like ram pressure stripping might be effective .",
    "the crossing time of fornax and virgo are about equal ( @xmath15 years , boselli and gavazzi , 2006 ) , but the lower velocity dispersion of fornax makes the inter - galactic medium less influential for the same inter - galactic medium density .",
    "we can quantify how effective ( @xmath16 ) ram pressure stripping might be using @xmath17 ( gunn and gott , 1972 ) where @xmath18 is the cluster velocity dispersion and @xmath19 is the gas density . from the x - ray data ( scharf et al .",
    "2005 , paolillo et al .",
    "2002 , schindler et al .",
    "1999 ) the central gas density and velocity dispersion of virgo is about 4 and 2 times higher respectively than fornax making virgo potentially about 16 times more effective at ram pressure stripping .",
    "so , because of these diverse cluster properties virgo and fornax galaxies may have quite different gas accretion / stripping histories .",
    "our new observations of fornax cluster galaxies described below make use of the unique imaging qualities and sensitivity of the herschel space telescope at five wavelengths from 100 - 500@xmath0 m . with a 3.5 m mirror the spatial resolution of herschel at these wavelengths ranges from 7 - 36@xmath20enabling spatially resolved observations of many of the bright galaxies at the distance of fornax ( 10@xmath20@xmath21 kpc ) .",

    "this paper is a continuation of the work we have previously done using the herschel virgo cluster survey ( hevics ) data , which is described in the following series of papers : * paper i * ( davies et al .",

    "we have obtained @xmath23 sq deg of data from a single field centred on the central fornax cluster galaxy ngc1399 ( ra(j2000)=03:38:29.08 , dec(j2000)=-35:27:2.7 ) , fig .",
    "1 . we use parallel mode and a fast scan rate of 60/sec ( as used for the hevics data ) over two@xmath22two orthogonal cross - linked scan directions ( 4 scans ) .",
    "pacs data reduction was carried out with the standard pipeline for both the 100 and 160@xmath0 m channels up to level-1 .",
    "the four scans were then combined and maps made using the _ scanamorphos _ map - maker ( roussel , 2012 ) .",
    "we chose to use _ scanamorphos _ , instead of the phot - project mapper used in previous papers ( davies et al . , 2012 ) , as this avoids the necessity of high - pass filtering , which would remove the lower level extended emission . after combining orthogonal scans",
    "the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) beam sizes are approximately 7and 13with pixel sizes of 2and 3for the 100 and 160 @xmath0 m channels respectively .",
    "the spire data were also processed up to level-1 with a custom driven pipeline script adapted from the official pipeline ( _ pof5_pipeline.py _ , dated 8 jun 2010 ) as provided by the spire instrument control centre ( icc ) .",
    "this _ jython _",
    "script was run in the herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe - ott , 2010 ) .",
    "our data reduction up to level-1 is very similar to the herschel common science system / standard product generation v5 with a calibration based on neptune data .",
    "specific differences to the standard pipeline were that we used the _ sigmakappadeglitcher _ instead of the icc - default _",
    "waveletdeglitcher_. furthermore , we did not run the default _ temperaturedriftcorrection _ and the residual , median baseline subtraction .",
    "instead we use a custom method called brigade ( smith et al . in preparation ) to remove the temperature drift and bring all bolometers to the same level ( equivalent to baseline removal ) .",
    "we have found this method improves the baseline subtraction significantly especially in cases where there are strong temperature variations during the observation .",
    "scans were then combined to make our final maps using the naive mapper provided in the standard pipeline .",
    "the fwhm of the spire beams are 18.2 , 24.5 , and 36.0with pixel sizes of 6 , 8 , and 12at 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the beam areas used were 423 , 751 and 1587 sq .",
    "arc sec respectively .",
    "the final data products have a 1@xmath24 noise , determined from the whole of each image , of @xmath250.6 , 0.7 , 1.0 , 1.0 and 1.0 mjy pixel@xmath12 or 6.4 , 3.3 , 1.2 , 0.7 and 0.3 mj sr@xmath12 at 100 , 160 , 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m respectively .    as in davies et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for the virgo cluster we obtain a bright far - infrared selected sample by carrying out our initial object selection at 500 @xmath0 m .",
    "this is because it is the least explored part of the spectrum , it has the lowest resolution , and most galaxies will produce their lowest flux in this band , which should guarantee a detection in all five bands . to produce an objectively selected sample we used the automatic image detection algorithm sextractor ( bertin and arnouts , 1996 ) . to minimise background contamination by faint sources each object",
    "was required to have more than 41 connected pixels at 1.5@xmath26 or above.m and so the two are equivalent . ]",
    "the result is a 500 @xmath0 m flux density limit of @xmath250.1 jy for sources with a diameter larger than 1.4 .",
    "each object was then checked for correspondence with a known fornax cluster galaxy ( fcc ) .",
    "the final sample consists of 11 fornax cluster objects , which is just 4% of the 256 fcc galaxies in our field .",
    "this compares with 78 galaxies detected in just the same way in the virgo cluster , which is 12% of the galaxies in this area listed in the vcc ( davies et al .",
    "a more straight forward comparison is that 14 galaxies were detected in the central 16 sq deg virgo field centred on m87 , compared to 11 over the same area centred on ngc1399 .",
    "discarded objects are in the background of fornax .",
    "in the standard way the data were initially smoothed and re - gridded to the 500 @xmath0 m resolution and pixel scale .",
    "elliptical apertures were chosen by eye using the 500@xmath0 m data , with the sky defined by a concentric annulus .",
    "these same annuli were then used on the smoothed and re - gridded data at other wavelengths . as a test we compared this method with carrying out the aperture photometry on the original unsmoothed 100@xmath0 m data , our criteria being correspondence with the flux density values at 100@xmath0 m from iras .",
    "these tests showed that we obtained a much better result by using the original resolution data , rather than the smoothed and re - gridded data .",
    "so , independent measurements were carried out on the maps at the original resolution , defining by eye for each galaxy an elliptical aperture and a nearby sky aperture that avoided pixels contaminated by bright background sources .",
    "the flux densities quoted in table 1 come from aperture photometry using this unsmoothed and original resolution data .",
    "m and the planck ( red ) flux densities with the spire 350@xmath0 m .",
    "linear least squares fit parameters are given top left . the black dashed line is the one to one relationship . ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      where available ( 8 out of 11 galaxies ) , we have taken the 21 cm spectral line flux integral ( @xmath27 , jy km s@xmath12 ) for each galaxy from ned and used the distances given in table 1 to obtain atomic hydrogen gas masses ( @xmath28 , m@xmath8 ) .",
    "the masses have been obtained using the standard formula :    @xmath29    atomic hydrogen gas masses are given in table 3 along with dust and stellar mass .    derived from co observations",
    "there are 4 detections and 3 upper limits on the molecular hydrogen masses of these galaxies ( horellou et al .",
    "nc1365 , ngc1386 , ngc1436 and eso358-g063 have log(@xmath30 ) equal to 10.3 , 8.3 , 7.7 and 8.6 respectively .",
    "there is almost a factor of 2 more molecular hydrogen in ngc1365 than atomic and ngc1386 is surprisingly detected in co , but not hi .",
    "ngc1351a , ngc1350 and ngc1387 all have upper limits on their molecular gas masses that are in each case more than a factor of 10 less than their atomic hydrogen masses",
    ". we have not incorporated this molecular gas data into table 3 or discussed it further so that this paper is directly comparable with the equivalent paper on virgo , where we have not included molecular gas masses ( davies et al . 2012 ) . in the above we",
    "have taken @xmath31 @xmath32 ( k km / s)@xmath12 .      by simply dividing the total mass in each component by the volume sampled ( @xmath2512.9(7.2 ) mpc@xmath33 )",
    "we can calculate the cluster mass densities . provided the luminosity distributions in each far - infrared band are peaked the total cluster dust mass should be well constrained by our sample galaxies unless there is a significant dust component in the inter - galactic medium . from the dust in our sample galaxies",
    "we derive the densities given in table 4 .",
    "values for virgo have been taken from davies et al .",
    "these values can be compared with a recent determination of the local dust mass density for galaxies in all environments from dunne et al .",
    "this shows that fornax is over dense in dust by about a factor of 120(196 ) while virgo is over dense by about a factor of 39(126 ) .    if the fornax hi mass function is peaked , similar to virgo ( davies et al .",
    "2004 , taylor 2010 ) , the hi gas in these galaxies should provide a good estimate of the cluster total . using the eight hi masses available ( table 3 ) we derive the hi mass density shown in table 4 .",
    "the value for virgo is taken from davies et al .",
    "recently , davies et al .",
    "( 2011 ) measured a local field hi mass density of @xmath34 m@xmath8 mpc@xmath35 ( see also martin et al .",
    "thus the fornax cluster is over dense in hi , when compared to the field , by a factor of 18(29 ) and virgo by 6(18 ) .    as a check of our assumption that our sample galaxies contain the majority of hi in the volume we have looked at the hipass data for fornax as described in waugh et al .",
    "there are three galaxies in our herschel field that have hi detections by waugh et al . , but are not in our sample ( a visual inspection shows that they are all detected in the far - infrared , but not at the required flux level ) .",
    "the three hi detections are eso358-g015 , eso358-g051 and eso358-g060 and using their distances as listed in ned they amount to just 9% of the total atomic hydrogen in our sample galaxies .",
    "comparing stellar mass functions is not quite so straight forward because of uncertainties in the faint end slope of the cluster luminosity function i.e the numbers of faint dwarf galaxies ( see sabatini et al .",
    ", 2003 , and references therein ) . for the stars in our sample galaxies we obtain the densities given in table 4 .",
    "the virgo value is again taken from davies et al .",
    "baldry et al .",
    "( 2008 ) recently derived the local galaxy stellar mass function and from it the field stellar mass density ( table 4 ) .",
    "thus the fornax cluster is over dense in stars by 120(195 ) compared to values for virgo of 34(129 ) . where required in the above derivations",
    "we have used h@xmath36=72 km s@xmath12 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .    the larger stellar mass density",
    "we calculate for fornax compared to virgo is again roughly consistent with the factor of 2.5 higher number density of galaxies derived by ferguson ( 1989 ) - fornax is a higher over density than virgo .",
    "interestingly , both virgo and fornax represent about equal over densities of dust and stars , but the atomic gas is relatively much more depleted ( table 4 ) .",
    "this presumably indicates that atomic gas has been removed from these galaxies without the loss of consummate amounts of dust , though cortese et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show , by the clear truncation of virgo cluster dust discs , that some dust must be lost from the outer regions of galaxies in the cluster environment .",
    "we can make a simple calculation to see the effect of ram pressure on both the gas and the dust .",
    "the force per unit area a particle in the disc of a galaxy experiences is the difference between the ram pressure and the restoring force per unit area due to the discs surface mass density ( gunn and gott , 1972 ) . in this case",
    "the acceleration a particle undergoes depends on its cross - sectional area ( @xmath39 ) and its mass ( @xmath40 ) and for constant acceleration the timescale for removal is just proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "using typical values for the masses ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) and sizes ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) of gas and dust particles leads a timescale for dust removal about a factor of 100 - 1000 longer than gas removal ( this ignores viscous drag between the gas and dust , see davies et al .",
    "evidence from virgo shows that atomic and molecular gas are also affected very differently by the cluster environment .",
    "there is no evidence for a h@xmath46 deficiency in virgo but there clearly is an atomic gas deficiency ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2008 , young et al .",
    "so , a complementary explanation for the non - removal of dust is that it is primarily associated with dense h@xmath46 reservoirs that are very resistant to the ram pressure stripping process .    using the davies et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and dunne et al .",
    "( 2011 ) values for the global hi and dust mass densities gives a local field atomic gas to dust ratio of 363 ( draine et al .",
    ", 2007 ) , but our calculation neglects the molecular gas included in this value . ] , while the same ratio in the fornax and virgo clusters is 52(53 ) and 58(50 ) respectively . from the above it",
    "seems that these low values are entirely due to the loss of atomic gas . in each case",
    "this amounts to about six times as much hi lost from these galaxies as is presently contained within them ( @xmath47 m@xmath8 and @xmath48 m@xmath8 respectively for virgo and fornax ) .",
    "it seems that irrespective of the different environments prevalent in these two clusters the atomic gas loss mechanisms are equally effective .",
    "hi complexes within the virgo cluster , but external to previously identified galaxies , have been found by davies et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , oosterloo and van gorkom ( 2005 ) and kent et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , but they only represent a small fraction of the cluster atomic gas .",
    "the brightest virgo cluster galaxy at these wavelengths is ngc4254 ( @xmath49 jy , @xmath50 mpc , davies et al . 2012 ) , but this is totally outshone by the fornax cluster galaxy ngc1365 ( @xmath51 jy , @xmath52 mpc ) .",
    "being so bright ngc1365 is also detected by planck in 4 bands at 350 , 550 , 850 and 1382@xmath0 m . in fig 4",
    "we show the pacs , spire and planck data along with the best fitting modified blackbody taken from fig 3 .",
    "the planck data are those derived by fitting a 2d gaussian to the data ( gauflux , which should be more appropriate for extended sources ) and color corrected using the herschel sed and the tables in the explanatory notes of the planck early release compact source catalogue .",
    "the planck data fit remarkably well the modified blackbody all the way out to 1382@xmath0 m .",
    "there is no significant sign of any excess emission above that of the modified blackbody , with the point at 1382@xmath0 m being the most discrepant .",
    "the band centred on 1382@xmath0 m contains the co(2 - 1 ) line and this might explain the slight excess . according to sandqvist et al .",
    "( 1995 ) the total co(1 - 0 ) luminosity of ngc1365 is 5200 jy km / s .",
    "for the planck bandwidth ( 33% of the central frequency ) and using the measured co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0)=0.8 ratio we find that the co(2 - 1 ) line contributes 0.045 jy ( 7% of the total ) to the 1382@xmath0 m flux density .",
    "if this is subtracted from the color corrected data , than the 1382@xmath0 m point sits nicely on top of the modified blackbody curve .    over these",
    "longer , planck wavelengths , we might also expect an additional contribution to the observed flux density from free - free emission ( synchrotron emission only starts to become important at wavelengths greater than @xmath251 cm , condon , 1992 ) . combining equations 23 and 26 from condon ( 1992 )",
    "we get : +    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the free - free flux density in jy at wavelength @xmath55 in @xmath0 m , @xmath56 is the distance in mpc and @xmath57 the far - infrared luminosity in solar units . for ngc1365 at a distance of @xmath58 mpc and @xmath59 @xmath60 the predicted flux densities at 850 and 1382@xmath0 m are 0.048 and 0.050 jy respectively .",
    "these values are again much smaller than the extrapolation of the modified blackbody curve and so free - free emission is predicted to be only a small fraction of the emission at these wavelengths .",
    "ngc1365 is a powerful seyfert ( type 1.8 ) galaxy ( veron - cetty and veron 2006 ) , but no sign of the agn is seen in its global far - infrared / sub - mm spectrum .",
    "previous observations of some more passive galaxies has revealed an excess at wavelengths beyond 350@xmath0 m , particularly the milky way ( leitch et al . 1997 ) and star forming dwarf galaxies ( grossi et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this emission has been associated with an additional spinning dust component ( draine and lazarian , 1998a , 1998b ) , but it is not observed here .          with a b band absolute magnitude of -20.7 ngc1399",
    "is just about a typical ( @xmath61 ) galaxy in terms of its optical luminosity .",
    "but , being an elliptical galaxy ( e1 ) lying at the very heart of the cluster we might expect that ngc1399 s inter - stellar medium is somewhat depleted compared to a galaxy like the milky way .",
    "no atomic hydrogen has been detected in ngc1399 , though there have been previous detections in the far - infrared possibly associated with dust emission .",
    "there is an iras detection at 0.3 jy ( ned ) which would be a marginal detection in our data dependent on the size of the source - but we detect nothing .",
    "there is a _ spitzer _ ( mips ) detection at 160@xmath0 m of 0.026 jy ( temi et al .",
    "2009 ) , but this is below our detection limit . for the similar , though slightly brighter in the optical m87 , our observations gave detections in all the pacs / spire bands ( davies et al .",
    "2012 ) , though this was almost exclusively synchrotron emission and not thermal emission from dust ( baes et al .",
    "2010 ) . for synchrotron emission from ngc1399",
    "we expect the highest flux density at the longest wavelengths , consistent with our detection at 500@xmath0 m and our non - detection at 100@xmath0 m .",
    "for the same spectral slope as m87 we would expect a 100@xmath0 m flux density of about 0.1 jy , below our detection threshold and rather at odds with the iras 100@xmath0 m detection ( which is too high ) and similarly at odds with the mips measurement ( which would be too low ) .",
    "there are radio synthesis observations ( 44resolution ) of ngc1399 at 35 cm that clearly show two opposing radio jets emanating from the nucleus ( jones and mcadam , 1992 ) . in fig .",
    "5 we show the 500@xmath0 m image of ngc1399 with the position and extent of the 35 cm radio jet indicated by the red arrow .",
    "the 500@xmath0 m emission appears more extended than the jet and also the jet seems to be off - set from it , but roughly at the same position angle .",
    "the optical centre of the galaxy ( ned ) corresponds with the centre of the jet . for m87",
    "the far - infrared emission clearly traces the radio jet and so it is a bit of a puzzle as to why ngc1399 is different .",
    "if the emission is actually due to dust , and this is some form of dust lane , then it is strange that it is not detected more strongly in the other spire bands .",
    "it also extends over some 3 arc min ( 16 kpc ) - this is large for a dust feature in an elliptical galaxy - ngc1399 does not appear in the catalogue of dusty ellipticals ( ebneter and balick , 1985 ) .",
    "there is also the possibility that this is some chance alignment of background sources .",
    "the region shown in fig . 5 is some 20 arc min across , specifically made this large to illustrate the brightness and number density of sources across the field .",

    "generally fornax is more dense in stars , gas and dust by a factor of 3 - 4 relative to virgo . when compared to the lower density local field of galaxies , fornax is overdense by a factor of about 120 in stars and dust , but only a factor of 18 in gas .",
    "values for virgo are about 34 and 39 for stars and dust , reducing to 6 for gas",

    "<S> we define a sample of eleven bright galaxies , selected at 500@xmath0 m , that can be directly compared with our past work on the virgo cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we check and compare our results with previous observations made by iras and planck , finding good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the far - infrared luminosity density is higher , by about a factor of three , in fornax compared to virgo , consistent with the higher number density of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the 100@xmath0 m ( 42.5 - 122.5 @xmath0 m ) luminosity is two orders of magnitude larger in fornax than in the local field as measured by iras . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate stellar ( @xmath3 ) and far - infrared ( @xmath4 ) luminosities for each galaxy and use this to estimate a mean optical depth of @xmath5 - the same value as we previously found for virgo cluster galaxies . for ten of the eleven galaxies ( ngc1399 excepted ) we fit a modified blackbody curve ( @xmath6 ) to our observed flux densities to derive dust masses and temperatures of @xmath7 m@xmath8 and t=14.6 - 24.2k respectively , values comparable to those found for virgo . the derived stars - to - gas(atomic ) and </S>",
    "<S> gas(atomic)-to - dust ratios vary from 1.1 - 67.6 and 9.8 - 436.5 respectively , again broadly consistent with values for virgo . </S>",
    "<S> fornax is a mass overdensity in stars and dust of about 120 when compared to the local field ( 30 for virgo ) . </S>",
    "<S> fornax and virgo are both a factor of 6 lower over densities in gas(atomic ) than in stars and dust indicating loss of gas , but not dust and stars , in the cluster environment . </S>",
