    "the static properties of baryons are an important testing ground for qcd based calculations in the confinement region . in particular",
    ", a recent comparison of theoretical predictions for @xmath2 magnetic moments in different approaches has been given in @xcite .",
    "however , little experimental information is available for hadrons outside of the ground state su(3 ) octet . in view of the short life - time of the resonances",
    ", such information has to come from a detailed analysis of intermediate states .",
    "it was therefore suggested by kondratyuk and ponomarev  @xcite to consider radiative @xmath3 scattering as a means to measure the static properties of the @xmath2 isobar . as a result of many experimental and theoretical efforts  @xcite ,",
    "the particle data group  @xcite now quotes a value of @xmath4  @xcite for the magnetic dipole moment of the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "the large error bar is due to large nonresonant processes , external bremsstrahlung by initial and final state particles , and a strong background due to interactions in both the initial and final states  @xcite .",
    "a much cleaner experiment would be an electromagnetic excitation of the nucleon leading to the @xmath2 resonance with subsequent emission of a real photon followed by the decay into a nucleon and a pion .",

    "@xcite have recently investigated this reaction in the framework of an effective lagrangian model . for an incident photon with lab energy @xmath7  mev ( equivalent to a @xmath8 energy @xmath9  mev or a total @xmath8 energy @xmath10  mev ) they find differential cross sections of the order of 0.5  nb / sr@xmath11  mev , with a maximum for photons emitted with lab energy @xmath12  mev and at an angle @xmath13 .",
    "if we integrate these differential cross sections over all angles of the emitted pion and photon and over the final state photon energy , we obtain a total cross section of several microbarns .",
    "unfortunately , the a2 collaboration at mami working with the taps detector has only been able to see 3-photon events  @xcite at a rate corresponding to a cross section of tens of nanobarns , partly originating from the reaction @xmath14",
    "it is the aim of this contribution to point out that we only expect total cross sections for this process in the range of 5 - 10 @xmath15 , which is probably at the limit of the present experimental accuracy . for this purpose",
    "we have calculated both elastic ( compton ) and inelastic photon scattering through the @xmath2 resonance in the constituent quark model  @xcite . though this model is somewhat naive and has certain deficiencies , it has the advantage that the ratio of elastic and inelastic photon scattering can be expressed analytically . as a result",

    "the angular distribution for photon emission is rather constant .    in the future we plan to improve our calculations by including the backgrounds due to bremsstrahlung off the incoming and outgoing protons as well as radiation from nonresonant intermediate states .",
    "though we do not expect qualitative changes by such terms , they are likely to influence the angular and energy distributions of the process . a better understanding of these backgrounds might also give a chance to analyze the data obtained with incident photons of higher energies , which would increase the counting rate by giving a larger phase space to the emitted particles .",
