    "the possible breaking of parton model symmetries by the nucleon s quark distribution functions has been a topic of great interest since the experimental discoveries that the ellis - jaffe @xcite and gottfried @xcite sum rules are violated . in particular , the flavour asymmetry in the nucleon sea ( @xmath3 ) has been confirmed by several experiments @xcite , and the @xmath2-dependence of this asymmetry has been investigated .",
    "this asymmetry can be naturally explained in the meson cloud model , in which the physical nucleon wave function contains many virtual meson - baryon components , and the valence anti - quark in the meson contributes ( via a convolution ) to the anti - quark distributions in the proton sea .",
    "since the probability of the fock state @xmath4 is larger than that of the @xmath5 state in the proton wave function , the asymmetry @xmath6 emerges naturally in the proton sea .",
    "there have been many theoretical investigations ( see e.  g. @xcite and references therein ) on this subject .",
    "recently there has been increasing interest in the question of whether this asymmetry extends also to the polarized sea distributions _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath7 .",
    "such a polarized sea asymmetry would make a direct contribution to the bjorken sum rule . although well established experimental evidence for a polarized sea asymmetry is still lacking ,",
    "some experimental studies have been done @xcite .",
    "moreover several parameterizations @xcite for the polarized parton distributions arising from fits of the world data from polarized experiments leave open the possibility of this asymmetry .",
    "there have also been some theoretical studies on this asymmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the polarized sea asymmetries are calculated in the chiral quark - soliton model ( using the large-@xmath8 limit ) .",
    "sizable results for @xmath1 and @xmath9 were found , and it was further predicted that the flavour asymmetry of the polarized sea distributions is larger than that of the unpolarized sea distributions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 .",
    "such sizeable asymmetries would make an important contribution ( around 20% ) to the bjorken sum rule .",
    "fries and schfer @xcite calculated the non - strange polarized sea asymmetry by considering the @xmath0 meson cloud in the meson cloud model .",
    "their prediction for @xmath11 is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the result from the chiral quark - soliton model .",
    "boreskov and kaidalov @xcite analysed this asymmetry by calculating the regge cut contribution to the imaginary part of the high - energy photon - nucleon scattering amplitude .",
    "they found that the interference between the amplitudes for the photon coupling to a pion or to a rho meson can provide a sizable polarized anti - quark asymmetry in the small @xmath2 region .",
    "this asymmetry has also been discussed in the instanton model @xcite and a statistical model @xcite for the parton distributions of the nucleon .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the flavour asymmetry of the non - strange polarized anti - quarks using the meson cloud model .",
    "we include both the vector meson cloud and the interference terms of the pseudoscalar and the vector mesons .",
    "such interference terms appear naturally in the meson cloud model . in section",
    "ii , we derive the formulas in the meson cloud model to calculate the flavour asymmetry of non - strange polarized anti - quark distributions . the numerical results are given in section iii along with discussion .",
    "in section iv we discuss how a contribution to the flavour asymmetry can arise from the fermion nature of the quarks , often called pauli blocking .",
    "section v is a summary .",
    "in the meson cloud model ( mcm ) the nucleon can be viewed as a bare nucleon plus some meson - baryon fock states which result from the fluctuation @xmath12 .",
    "the wavefunction of the nucleon can be written as @xcite , |n_physical = z |n_bare + _ mb _ ^ dy d^2 * k * _ ^^_mb(y , k_^2 ) |m^(y , * k * _ ) ; b^^(1-y,-*k * _ ) [ nmcm ] where @xmath13 is the wave function renormalization constant , @xmath14 is the wave function of the fock state containing a meson ( @xmath15 ) with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath16 , transverse momentum @xmath17 , and helicity @xmath18 , and a baryon ( @xmath19 ) with momentum fraction @xmath20 , transverse momentum @xmath21 , and helicity @xmath22 .",
    "the model assumes that the lifetime of a virtual baryon - meson fock state is much larger than the interaction time in the deep inelastic or drell - yan process , thus the quark and anti - quark in the virtual meson - baryon fock states can contribute to the parton distributions of the nucleon . for spin independent parton distributions",
    "these non - perturbative contribution can usually be expressed as a convolution of fluctuation functions with the valance parton distributions in the meson and/or baryon .",
    "for polarised parton distributions in the model it is necessary to include all the terms which can lead to the same final state @xcite .",
    "this allows the possibility of interference terms between different terms in the nucleon wavefunction eq .",
    "( [ nmcm ] ) .",
    "the effect of interference between @xmath23 and @xmath24 terms on polarised quark distributions was calculated in @xcite . for polarised anti - quark distributions",
    "the interference will be between terms with different mesons and the same baryon e.g. @xmath23 and @xmath25 , see fig .  1 .",
    "we can write the total meson cloud contribution to the distribution of anti - quarks of a given flavour with helicity @xmath26 as x ^(x)=_^1_x dy f^_(m_1 m_2)b / n ( y ) ^_(m_1 m_2 ) ( ) [ xqbar ] where f^_(m_1 m_2)b / n ( y)=_^ ^_0 d k_^2 ^^_m_1 b(y , k_^2 ) ^*^_m_2 b(y , k_^2 ) , [ ff ] is the helicity dependent fluctuation function .",

    "( [ xqbar4 ] ) explicitly shows the existence of the interference contributions .",
    "we would like to point out that the above interference terms do not contribute to the unpolarized parton distributions due to the flavour - spin structure of the @xmath34 wavefunction .",
    "for example , the @xmath35-@xmath36 interference term contributes to @xmath37 and @xmath38 with equal magnitude but opposite sign ( see the below expressions for the wave functions ) , so the result is zero when the helicities are summed up .",

    "it is interesting that both models agree well with the experimental data for the unpolarized asymmetry , yet predict very different results for the polarized asymmetry . as the magnitude of the predicted polarized asymmetry appears to be fairly natural in each of these models",
    ", experimental data will provide a valuable test of these models , and give insight into the relation between helicity dependent and helicity independent observables in quark models .",
    "we do not find that the @xmath151 interference terms can be sizeable , which appears to be in disagreement with the conclusions of boreskov and kaidalov @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this disagreement is that we do not here consider interference terms where the @xmath0 meson has non - zero helicity .",
    "this is because any such terms only contribute to amplitudes in the virtual compton scattering which have a spin - flip between the incoming and outgoing proton states .",
    "these spin - flip amplitudes in turn only contribute to the cross - section @xmath152 , which is the interference between transverse and longitudinal polarisations of the virtual photon @xcite _ i & & + & & so any interference terms involving non - zero helicity @xmath0 mesons can be expected to decrease as @xmath153 as @xmath154 gets large . using",
    "the operator product expansion shows that the relevant operators are all twist 3 or higher .",
    "as the experimental data for @xmath155 for both the proton and the neutron show no marked @xmath154 dependence , we conclude that these higher twist contributions are not relevant at the experimental scales .",
    "we have not so far considered any contribution to the asymmetry arising from ` pauli blocking ' effects @xcite . in a model such as the bag model , where the valence quarks are confined by a scalar field , the vacuum inside a hadron is different from the vacuum outside .",
    "this manifests itself as a distortion in the negative energy dirac sea , which is full for the outside ( or free ) vacuum , whereas there will be empty states in the dirac sea of the bag . to an external probe",
    "this change in vacuum structure appears as an intrinsic , non - perturbative sea of @xmath156 pairs @xcite .",
    "this change in the vacuum is similar to the change in the fermi - dirac distribution when the temperature is raised above absolute zero .",
    "now when a quark is put into the ground state of the bag it wil have the effect of filling some of the empty negative energy states in the sea of the bag vacuum .",
    "the reason for this is that the ground state wavefunction can be written as a wavepacket in terms of plane wave states of positive and negative energy , with the energy distribution of the wavepacket centred at the ground state energy eigenvalue , but with non - zero contributions from negative energy plane waves .",
    "hence the presence of a quark in the bag ground state lowers the probability of a negative energy state being empty , which is the same as lowering the probability of finding a positive energy antiquark .",
    "as the proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark , the probability of finding a @xmath157 antiquark is reduced more than the probability of finding a @xmath158 antiquark _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath159 .",
    "the analysis of ref @xcite showed that , in the context of the meson cloud model , about 50% of the observed @xmath160 asymmetry may be due to pauli blocking .",
    "when we include spin in the analysis of pauli blocking , we find that putting a spin up quark into the bag ground state has the effect of filling some of the negative energy spin up quark states in the bag vacuum , which is equivalent to lowering the probability of finding a positive energy spin down antiquark . as the @xmath34 wavefunction of the spin up proton is dominated by terms with the two up quarks having spin parallel to the proton spin and the down quark having spin anti - parallel , pauli blocking predicts that the probabilities of finding spin down @xmath157 antiquarks and spin up @xmath158 antiquarks are reduced _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath161 or @xmath162    we can also estimate the contribution of the pauli blocking effect to the polarized asymmetry , again using the adelaide group s argument for calculating parton distributions in the bag model . in the parton model antiquark distribution functions",
    "are given by |q^(x ) = p^+ _ n ( p^+(1-x)-p_n^+ ) |",
    "n | ( 1 ^5)^_+(0 ) | p , s |^2 .",
    "the appropriate intermediate state @xmath163 consists of four quarks .",
    "if we assume the @xmath34 wavefunction for the proton with spin @xmath164 , and insert an additional quark only into the radial ground state , then we have the following matrix elements for the projection operators onto spin and flavour @xcite |p^(q)_u , + 1/2| = , & & |p^(q)_u , -1/2| = , +    of spin - spin coupling in the intermediate state . following the argument of the adelaide group for calculating the parton distributions we can then write the antiquark distributions as |u^ & = & 2 f_(4)(x ) g_(4)(x ) , +    @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the spin independent and spin dependent kinematic integrals over the momentum of the intermediate four quark state .",
    "the sea asymmetries can then be expressed as |d(x ) - |u(x ) & = & f_(4)(x ) , +    all @xmath2 , pauli blocking gives a negative contribution to the spin dependent flavour asymmetry in the sea , whereas the meson cloud contribution tended to be positive . also noting that as @xmath167 , we can integrate over all @xmath2 and then obtain an upper limit for the size of the pauli blocking contribution to the spin dependent asymmetry in terms of the contribution to the spin independent asymmetry : -_0 ^ 1 dx [ |d(x ) - |u(x ) ] _ 0 ^ 1 dx [ |d(x ) - |u(x ) ] .",
    "[ pbsums ] as an estimate for the integral on the rhs of eqn .",
    "( [ pbsums ] ) we may use the value of @xmath168 given by the analsis of reference @xcite .",
    "this then gives an upper limit of about @xmath169 for the magnitude of the integral over the polarized asymmetry .",
    "in the bag model , the ratio @xmath170 varies from about @xmath171 at low @xmath2 to unity at large @xmath2 , which gives us a value of about @xmath172 for the integrated polarized asymmetry .",
    "while these values are calculated at some scale appropriate to the bag model , the values of the integrals are not much affected by evolution up to experimental scales , so we expect the relation between polarized and unpolarized sea asymmetries to be approximately correct at all scales .",
    "the value of the pauli blocking contribution to the integrated polarized asymmetry is much larger than that we have calculated in the meson cloud model , in contrast to approximate equality in the unpolarized case .",
    "thus the experimental observation of any asymmetry in the polarized sea distributions is much more a test of the pauli blocking hypothesis than of the meson cloud model .",
    "the bjorken sum rule may be written _",
    "0 ^ 1 dx [ g_1^p(x ) - g_1^n(x ) ] & = & _ 0 ^ 1 dx [ ( u(x ) - d(x ) ) + ( |u(x ) - |d(x ) ) ] + & = & | | ( 1 - ) .",
    "we estimate that the contribution to the sum rule from pauli blocking plus meson cloud effects is about 5 - 10% of the value of the sum rule .",
    "we note that the dortmund group have recently @xcite analyzed the polarized sea asymmetry also using a pauli blocking type ansatz , and found a value around @xmath173 for the integrated asymmetry .",
    "this would correspond to a contribution of around 20% to the bjorken sum rule .",
    "the dortmund analysis was based on the proposed relation between polarized distributions : = .",
    "[ dortpol ] this relation is not obeyed by the distributions in our analysis .",
    "the reason for this is that pauli blocking should most affect the @xmath174 distribution rather than the @xmath175 distribution ( starting from an assumed @xmath34 value of 0 ) , and hence the lhs of the relation ( [ dortpol ] ) has magnitude less than one , while the magnitude of the rhs is greater than one .",
    "the meson cloud model is very successful in explaining the flavour asymmetry of the unpolarized parton distributions in the nucleon sea . in this paper , we have calculated the flavour asymmetry for the polarized anti - quark distributions of the nucleon .",
    "we have included the contributions from both the vector meson cloud and the interference terms between pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "we have used two prescriptions to describe the polarized valance quark distribution of the @xmath0 meson ",
    "( i ) calculating it in bag model and ( ii ) employing the ansatz given in @xcite to relate it to the unpolarized quark distribution of the @xmath33 meson .",
    "our calculations show that the interference effect mildly increases the prediction for @xmath176 in the intermediate @xmath2 region .",
    "we have also discussed the effect of ` pauli blocking ' on the asymmetry , and have seen that this effect gives a larger contribution to the asymmetry than meson cloud effects , in contrast to the unpolarized case .",
    "we would like to thank tony thomas , wally melnitchouk , andreas schreiber and kazuo tsushima for a number of useful discussions , especially in regard to the sign of pauli blocking contributions to the polarized sea asymmetry .",
