    "recently , a  considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the theoretical and experimental investigation of two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum spin systems . in case of the ideal 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet ( af ) on a  square lattice ,",
    "the magnetic long - range order is suppressed by zero - point fluctuations at any finite temperature.@xcite however , the presence of an easy - axis anisotropy can induce a  finite - temperature phase transition into the nel ordered state.@xcite on the other hand , for an easy - plane anisotropy , a  transition of the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type  @xcite was proposed , where the high - temperature disordered phase can be described as a  gas of vortices . below the bkt transition ( @xmath5 ) , the vortices are bound in vortex - antivortex pairs , and the spin - spin correlation decay changes from exponential to algebraic.@xcite a  crossover from the isotropic to xy behavior in low fields has been predicted for 2d heisenberg af.@xcite    interplane interactions ( which are always present in real materials ) can significantly modify the ground - state properties of quasi-2d systems , inducing for instance a  phase transition with three - dimensional ( 3d ) long - range magnetic order . due to the onset of 3d ordering in most real materials ,",

    "the variation of the ratio @xmath14 allows to study nicely the rich phase diagram of quasi-2d magnetic systems , including the transition from a  2d heisenberg af ( @xmath15 ) to the 3d heisenberg af ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "remarkably , even in presence of relatively strong interplane interactions , the 2d quantum fluctuations can significantly affect the magnetic properties of such systems,@xcite resulting , for instance , in a  peculiar non - monotonic field dependence of the ordering temperature .",
