    "the electrical conductivity is a very difficult and yet interesting problem , specially in presence of nonperturbative effects .",
    "in such a case , numerical methods are called for . in this work ,",
    "we want to show that lattice - regularized euclidean field theories can be useful in this respect , at least in the limit of vanishing temperature .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the so called _ sign - problem _ needs still to be overcome in many cases  @xcite ( see , though , refs .",

    ", we restrict ourselves to a model consisting of fermions that only interact with an external electromagnetic field . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", it shares many properties with more realistic models , and it can be considered as a necessary first step to check any numerical method which could be used in models with dynamical interactions .",
    "we consider the standard @xmath0 lattice - action , with wilson fermions and finite chemical potential , but with the gauge variables held fixed .",
    "we shall study the residue of the pole of the electrical conductivity at zero - frequency , which is purely imaginary .",
    "since a non - vanishing value for this residue unambiguously signals a conducting phase , this is a rather interesting quantity in our opinion . in order to obtain it ,",
    "we measure the electrical - current induced in the system by an external electric field .",
    "this technique requires a numerical calculation even in the case of an external spatially - homogeneous time - dependent electromagnetic field .",
    "the delicate point , however , is that our electric field varies in euclidean time .",
    "one can nevertheless assume that there is a linear relation between the euclidean current and the euclidean electric field , at least for small fields .",
    "this _ euclidean conductivity _ presents a pole whose residue can be straightforwardly measured . to check that the obtained result is physical , we follow a very elegant procedure due to kohn@xcite .",
    "he showed that the _ real - time _ residue can be measured by studying the sensitivity of the ground - state energy to an external aharonov - bohm electromagnetic field .",
    "we show how can this be done in the lattice formalism , and , in this particularly simple case of free fermions , we calculate it ( unfortunately , the kohn recipe seems really hard to use in a monte carlo study of a self - interacting problem ) .",
    "although at present we lack a rigorous proof of the equivalence of both calculations , its excellent numerical agreement gives a strong support to the linear response method .",
    "let us consider a model of wilson fermions@xcite in a lattice of spacing @xmath1 in the three spatial directions and @xmath2 in the temporal one , coupled to an external electromagnetic field .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 to the quotient @xmath4 .",

    "the indices @xmath12 run on the points of the four - dimensional space - time lattice .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions for the gauge field , and periodic in space but antiperiodic in time ( @xmath13 ) for the grassmann field .",
    "the site @xmath14 is the neighbor of @xmath15 in the @xmath16 direction . for finite temporal length , @xmath17 ,",
    "the system is at finite temperature @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we will only consider the zero temperature ( @xmath19 ) limit .",
    "we follow the prescription of introducing the chemical potential through an imaginary gauge field @xmath20  @xcite , which is fairly convenient for analytical calculations .",
    "the wilson parameter , @xmath21 , can be taken different for the spatial and time directions . in the limit @xmath22 with @xmath1",
    "fixed the model describes a spatial lattice with a continuous time ( as electrons in a metal ) , while for a continuum field theory both spatial and time continuum limits should be taken .",
    "we shall use the following representation for the ( euclidean ) gamma matrices @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the pauli matrices .    to define the electric four - current in the lattice we recall that in the space - time continuum limit it is defined as @xmath25 that can be obtained as a logarithmic derivative of the partition function respect to the gauge - field .",
    "this calculation can be exactly mimicked on the lattice noticing that a change in the link variable should be of the form @xmath26 . in this way one obtains  @xcite : @xmath27 where now @xmath28 the @xmath29 component is just the electric charge density that one encounters by differentiating with respect to @xmath30 the free energy density  @xcite . moreover , from the gauge invariance of the determinant of the fermionic matrix , @xmath31 , it is straightforward to prove the lattice continuity equation , for any configuration of the electromagnetic - field : @xmath32    eqs .",

    "[ den - res ] , dashed line ) .",
    "the upper limit of the band corresponds to the saturation due to the fermi statistics ( one particle per lattice - site ) . since the function @xmath42 is periodic , its gradient has zeroes in the brillouin zone , producing non - analiticies as the cusps in fig .",

    "the construction is as follows .",
    "the system of interest is constrained to verify periodic boundary conditions in the ( say ) first spatial direction , and immersed in an aharonov - bohm like electromagnetic field @xmath45 . with this choice of boundary conditions",
    "the product @xmath46 is gauge invariant since it represents the magnetic flux traversing the system .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ground - state energy and @xmath49 is the spatial volume .",
    "it is crucial that the infinite limit volume is taken _ after _",
    "the @xmath50 derivative is performed , since the effect of the aharonov - bohm field can be thought of as a change in the boundary conditions ( see below ) . in the infinite volume limit ,",
    "the energy no longer depends on @xmath50 .    in our case ,",
    "as the free energy and the ground - state energy coincide in the zero temperature limit , we can study the residue in the following way @xmath51 where @xmath52 is obtained from the intensive free energy @xmath53 after subtracting the vacuum contribution : @xmath54 .",
    "let us sketch the calculation .",
    "the free energy should be calculated in a finite volume and at finite temperature .",
    "we introduce our system in the aharonov - bohm electromagnetic field : @xmath55 this field can be transformed into a boundary effect by performing the following gauge transformation : @xmath56 so that @xmath57 excepting @xmath58 by direct inspection of the fermion matrix in eq .  ( [ matriz ] ) , one can easily recognize that a system verifying periodic boundary conditions in the 1 direction in the field @xmath59 is equivalent the same system with no field at all , but verifying @xmath60 this amounts to substituting @xmath61 by @xmath62 in the momentum - quantification in a finite lattice . for a system of free fermions",
    "the free energy can be now straightforwardly calculated .",
    "once the @xmath50 derivative is performed , the zero temperature limit can be taken by transforming the @xmath63 sum into an integral .",
    "we get , in the simplest case @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath64    notice that for the empty system , @xmath65 , the integral vanishes , as well as for the full band @xmath66 , since @xmath67 is a periodic function of @xmath61 .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ den - res ] ( dashed line in the lower part ) .",
    "in this section , we are going to reproduce the results of the sections [ model ] and [ elect ] by directly considering the integration of the partition function .",
    "this method has the advantage of being generalizable to inhomogeneous external fields , and also when interacting dynamical fields are present .",
    "examples of how to introduce an external field on an interacting lattice - gauge system can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . to compute the partition function",
    "it is necessary to work in finite lattices , consequently , an infinite volume limit should be taken .",
    "we have carried out measures in symmetric lattices of sizes @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "for the hopping term , we have taken @xmath72 .",
    "as the integral in the fermionic fields is gaussian , the computation of the electric current just requires the inversion of a @xmath73 matrix , @xmath74 being the space - time volume . the fermion matrix ( [ matriz ] ) being sparse , we have used a conjugate - gradient algorithm for the numerical inversion .",
    "we first consider the density of states in a vanishing external field . in order to measure @xmath75",
    "we invert the matrix at @xmath76 for @xmath77 small enough . in interacting systems",
    "the derivative can be calculated in terms of connected correlation - functions  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ den - res ] , upper part , together with the infinite volume values obtained analytically .",
    "although the finite size effects are non negligible even in the larger lattices for most values of @xmath78 , there is a clear trend to the asymptotic values .",
    "unfortunately , for an interacting system it is not immediate how to implement kohn s method for calculating the residue of the conductivity .",
    "in fact , the free energy is rather hard to calculate with a monte carlo simulation and what one directly obtains are mean - values .",
    "we are now going to present a different way of computing the residue , by directly measuring the system response to an external electrical field .",
    "notice that the presence of an electric field requires a non - homogeneous vector potential and consequently the inversion of the fermion matrix can no longer be performed in closed analytical form .",
    "this new recipe can be straightforwardly generalized to interacting systems , but its equivalence with the kohn s method is just an ansatz .",
    "nevertheless the agreement is excellent , as we will show .    by analogy with continuum electrodynamics , we want to study the electric current induced in the system by an external weak uniform electric field in the @xmath79 direction .",
    "the conductivity ( in the frequency domain ) , will be the proportionality constant between the electrical current and the external field .",
    "there are some subtleties that need to be considered when putting an external electric field on the lattice .",
    "we take the gauge - field configuration ( @xmath80 ) @xmath81 @xmath82 notice that the quantization of the electric - field is due to the spatial boundary conditions . to preserve the translational symmetry ,",
    "the displaced gauge field @xmath83 should be a gauge - transform of the one in eq .",
    "( [ uelectrico ] ) . since the needed gauge transformation is analogous to eq .",
    "( [ cambiogauge ] ) , it is easy to check that the condition that allows this transformation is the trivialness of the polyakov loop : @xmath84 with @xmath85 integer .",
    "this condition also allows to transform the gauge field to the coulomb gauge @xmath86 .",
    "if condition ( [ polyakov ] ) is violated , the translational invariance is lost and the electric current is no longer spatially homogeneous even on a homogeneous electric - field . however , with the correct field choice ( [ polyakov ] ) , we get a homogeneous electrical current aligned with the external electrical field , and imaginary as anticipated in eq .",
    "( [ jconj ] ) . in order to directly compare with the results obtained with eq .",
    "( [ condkohn ] ) , let us define @xmath87 if we want to stay within linear - response theory , we have to postulate a linear relation between the fourier transform of the electrical current @xmath88 and the external electrical field @xmath89 : @xmath90 notice that both @xmath88 and @xmath89 being real , @xmath91 .",
    "however , the results can be more cleanly cast in terms of a modified fourier transform for the electrical field : @xmath92 the rationale for this is that the electrical field @xmath89 on the lattice lives mid - way between sites at times @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the modified conductivity @xmath95 is related with the previous one by @xmath96 the nice feature of @xmath97 is that it turns out to be purely imaginary .    in fig .",
    "[ curvaconductividad ] we plot the imaginary part of @xmath97 as obtained from a field with @xmath98 and @xmath99 , ( from now on we shall only indicate the non - vanishing @xmath100 s ) , in a system of wilson fermions with @xmath70 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , that is within the band energy - range and therefore with a non - vanishing fermi surface .",
    "we see that for large frequencies the thermodynamic limit is reached in rather small lattices . however , at the minimal reachable frequency ( @xmath103 ) the conductivity is rapidly growing suggesting a singularity at zero frequency .",
    "in fact , for a ( classical ) system of free particles of density @xmath85 we expect that @xmath104 will behave as @xmath105 notice that if @xmath104 has a pole at @xmath106 with a purely imaginary residue the same will hold true for @xmath97 , and both residues will be equal .",
    "although the _ euclidean _ conductivity @xmath97 do not match the real - time one ( being imaginary , it can not fulfill the kramers - kronig relations ) , one can formally expect the residues to coincide in the passage from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "this suggest to define the following quantity which will be the basic object of our study : @xmath109 in the @xmath110 limit , @xmath111 tend to the residue of the pole . in order to measure this ,",
    "we have considered the smallest of possible external disturbances : @xmath112 .",
    "our result is shown in fig .",
    "[ den - res ] , lower part .",
    "we see that the _ euclidean _ residue follows quite closely kohn s result , which in fact can be considered as the infinite volume limit for our calculation .",
    "moreover , the physical picture is rather transparent : when the band is full , the system gets almost inert , while when the band is empty , it can be excited by the external field creating a hole in the dirac sea . since the smallest possible",
    "excitation has frequency @xmath103 , to be compared with a gap @xmath113 , it is reasonable that at @xmath114 , the larger is the space - time lattice , the smaller is the system response .",
    "in fact , notice that in fig .",
    "[ den - res ] when @xmath78 is below the lower band limit , the curves get horizontal : in this range of @xmath78 the system can be only excited by crossing the gap between the dirac sea and the conduction band . and the gap is , of course , @xmath78 independent in a non - interacting system .",
    "we remark that our results have been found within the linear response approximation .",
    "we can control this approximation in several ways .",
    "one is to study the fourier transform of the current , for frequencies at which the fourier transform of the external - field vanishes . in fig .",
    "[ nolineal ] we show the zero - mode of the electrical current for the electrical - field @xmath115 .",
    "we see that this non - linear effect tends to zero with growing lattice - size , which is quite reasonable since the minimum possible electric field is @xmath116 .",
    "the non - linear corrections are oscillating , but modulated by a rapidly decaying function . roughly speaking , for the largest lattice the non linear effects are of the same order as the distance to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a further check can be done by comparing the residue obtained from the data in fig .",
    "[ curvaconductividad ] with the one in fig .",
    "[ den - res ] : in the @xmath117 lattice , the differences are at the @xmath118 level , while in the @xmath119 lattice the differences are at the @xmath120 level .",
    "therefore , we believe that non - linear effects are under control for the not too small fields that we can deal with .",
    "we have presented a simple way of studying the electrical conductivity of a system of wilson fermions at finite density and zero - temperature in a path - integral formalism . in particular , we have computed the residue of the zero frequency pole of the conductivity , by numerically considering the linear response to an external electric field , varying in euclidean time .",
    "the results have been contrasted with an analytical computation based on a method proposed by kohn , and an excellent agreement has been found . as a further cross - check ,",
    "we have computed the density of states both analytically and numerically in a finite lattice , obtaining a nice thermodynamic limit convergence .",
    "it should be emphasized that in contrast with the analytical calculation which can only be done for a non interacting system ( or , at most , for simple external fields ) , the numerical calculations are easily generalizable to more complex models , as fermions self - coupled with quartic interactions or via a dynamic bosonic field .",
    "an open , very interesting question is the possibility of extracting the full real - time electrical conductivity function from its _ euclidean _ counterpart .",
    "we have shown that the residue of the zero - frequency pole can indeed be obtained",
    ". it would be also very interesting to extend this approach to systems at finite - temperature .",
    "this work was triggered during a discussion with f. guinea to whom we are indebted for many suggestions , discussions and bibliographical help .",
