    "the one - dimensional asymmetric exclusion process , which can be regarded as the prototypical stochastic interacting particle system @xcite , has been intensively studied in view of its non - equilibrium properties @xcite , exact solvability @xcite and applicability to practical problems @xcite .",
    "the state space for the exclusion process is the set of configurations of particles ( in other words , the exclusion process has a `` spatial structure '' ) , and each particle can hop to its nearest neighbor sites only if the target site is empty ( `` excluded - volume effect '' ) .",
    "on the other hand , the queueing process is one of the basic stochastic processes in the field of operations research @xcite .",
    "in addition to its practical relevance it often appears as effective model , e.g.   in all kinds of jamming phenomena .",
    "usually the spatial structure of the queue is neglected , i.e.  the queues are regarded as `` compact '' .",
    "however , often this assumption is not justified , e.g.  in pedestrian queues .",
    "therefore , recently a queueing process with excluded - volume effect ( _ exclusive queueing process _ , eqp ) has been proposed @xcite . on a semi - infinite lattice ,",
    "particles enter the system at the left site next to the leftmost occupied site and leave the system at the rightmost site . in the bulk the particles move according to the rules of the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eq ] .    the epq can be interpreted as a tasep with varying system length which allows to analyze its stationary - state properties @xcite . in a more recent paper @xcite",
    ", dynamical properties of the eqp were analyzed .",
    "especially , for the deterministic bulk hopping case , dynamical behaviors of the average system length and the average number of particles were investigated exactly . in this paper",
    "we derive more detailed results for the dynamical properties .",
    "the stationary state of the tasep and some of its generalizations have been solved by means of the matrix product ansatz in the recent two decades @xcite .",
    "the application of the matrix product ansatz to the calculation of non - stationary states is quite challenging and has been achieved only in a few cases so far , see e.g.   @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will introduce a matrix product dynamical state for the eqp , providing an explicit representation for the matrices .",
    "we utilize it for calculating typical quantities both in queueing theory and exclusion processes .    here",
    "we define the eqp as a discrete - time markov process on a semi - infinite chain where sites are labeled by natural numbers from right to left ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eq ] ) .",
    "a new particle enters the chain with probability @xmath1 only at the left site next to the leftmost occupied site ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "if there is no particle on the chain , a new particle enters at the ( fixed ) rightmost site ( @xmath3 ) with probability @xmath1 . each particle on the chain necessarily hops to its right nearest neighbor site if it is empty , i.e.  we consider the limit of deterministic bulk hopping ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "a particle on the rightmost site leaves the system with probability @xmath4 .",
    "these transitions occur simultaneously within one time step , i.e.  we apply the fully parallel update scheme . since we restrict our consideration to the case of deterministic bulk hopping @xmath0 ( the so - called rule 184 cellular automaton ) , the stochasticity of the model is due to only the injection and extraction probabilities @xmath1 and @xmath4 .    in @xcite ,",

    "the system approaches a stationary state which can be written in a matrix product form . on the other hand , in the divergent phase , a stationary state does not exist , and the average length of the system @xmath7 and the average number of particles @xmath8 increase asymptotically linearly in time @xmath9 . on the `` critical line '' @xmath10 , both @xmath11 and @xmath12 exhibit diffusive behavior , i.e.  they increase being asymptotically proportional to @xmath13 .    in this paper , we investigate the dynamical ( i.e. time - dependent ) properties of the eqp in more detail . in the next section",
