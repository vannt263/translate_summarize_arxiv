    "random lasers are probably among the most exotic sources of coherent light studied so far  @xcite .",
    "as their name already suggests , random lasers get their optical feedback not by external mirrors or through a resonator , but rather by the random scattering of light in a disordered medium .",
    "even though this operational principle makes a deliberate tuning or selection of desired laser modes and output frequencies technically rather involved  @xcite , first promising applications of random lasers are recently emerging for which these cost - efficient devices are ideally suited  @xcite . from the fundamental point of view , random lasers offer an exciting research area at the interface between mesoscopic physics , non - hermitian optics , and laser physics  @xcite . particularly exciting in this context",
    "is the hypothesis , first put forward by lethokov  @xcite , that random lasers may actually be occurring also on a natural basis in stellar gases , since both multiple scattering and amplification are present in such media  @xcite .",
    "such hitherto unobserved `` astrophysical random lasers '' would have a spatial extension many orders of magnitudes larger than the micron - sized random lasers that are meanwhile routinely fabricated in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the vastly different length scales on which random lasing may occur , and the many different physical systems in which they have been realized , have triggered the development of different theoretical approaches to describe this phenomenon  @xcite . whereas it might appear reasonable that a radiative transfer approach , which does not incorporate interference effects , may be appropriate for astronomical length scales with long amplifying paths and few scattering events , and a diffusive model may be suitable to describe strongly scattering media in the diffusive limit  @xcite , it has so far remained unexplored how to describe the crossover between such different regimes .",
    "an important aspect that is also missing in the literature is a global perspective on random lasing in which all the possible random lasing regimes are charted and properly identified",
    ".    the aim of this paper will be to take such a bird s eye perspective on random lasing and to connect different approaches with each other .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the general question which size a medium with a certain amount of gain and disorder needs to have such that it reaches the random lasing threshold . to address this problem",
    "we employ approximative tools such as the radiative transfer equation ( rte ) ( for the low - scattering , or quasi - ballistic , limit ) as well as a diffusive model ( for the strongly scattering limit ) and compare them with a full solution of the scalar wave equation that encompasses both of these limits just as well as the crossover region in between . while the latter model includes diffraction and interference effects and relies on heavy numerical simulations , the diffusive and radiative transfer models are `` incoherent '' in the sense that they neglect all wave effects .",
    "their advantage is to provide simple analytical results .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we first briefly recall letokhov s seminal results on the threshold of random lasers based on the diffusion equation  @xcite . in sec .",
    "3 we present a theory of the random laser threshold based on the rte . in sec .",
    "4 we introduce the employed coherent wave model . finally , in sec .",
    "5 we compare the results from these different models and discuss the conclusions that can be drawn from them .",
    "a short summary is presented in sec .",
    "we summarize here the well - known results of letokhov on the random laser threshold  @xcite .",
    "the presentation is inspired by the one given in the review  @xcite .",
    "we start from the diffusion equation for light with a gain term , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy density , @xmath2 is the energy transport velocity inside the medium , @xmath3 is the gain length and @xmath4 is the diffusion coefficient . at 2d or 3d",
    ", it reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mean free path . for simplicity , we consider only isotropic scatterers such that the mean free path is equal to the transport length  @xcite . to map our results also to the case of finite - size scatterers , which scatter anisotropically , the scattering mean free path @xmath6 needs to be rescaled to the transport length @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the scattering angle . the scatterers need to stay below the wavelength though , as shape - specific resonances would otherwise destroy the universality of our analysis  @xcite .    using the modal decomposition @xmath9 with appropriate boundary conditions",
    ", one can show that the threshold of a random laser is reached when @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the smallest eigenvalue , corresponding with the longest - lived mode .",
    "for a 3d sphere of radius @xmath12 , @xmath13 and for a 2d disk of radius @xmath12 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the first root of the bessel function @xmath16 .",
    "finally it leads to the following critical radius @xmath17 note that the numerical factors in front of @xmath18 differ from each other by only a few percents .",
    "note also that we have neglected here the `` extrapolation length ''  @xcite , which is a small correction in the diffusive limit that we consider in this section .",
    "the diffusive , or multiple - scattering regime , is reached when @xmath19 , which corresponds to the validity range of this threshold condition .",
    "in a regime of low scattering , transport of light is no longer governed by a diffusive equation , but is well described by the radiative transfer equation ( rte ) .",
    "the rte is used in many different fields dealing with transport in complex media , such as astrophysics  @xcite , neutron physics  @xcite , or biological imaging  @xcite .",
    "the diffusion equation can be derived from the rte with supplementary approximations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the rte is thus more general and has been shown to be valid from the ballistic regime to the diffusive one  @xcite .",
    "it neglects , however , all wave effects like interference and diffraction .",
    "the basic quantity of the rte is the `` radiance '' or `` specific intensity '' @xmath20 , which describes the photon density at point @xmath21 , propagating along direction @xmath22 at time @xmath23 . in a system exhibiting absorption and scattering , the rte reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the linear absorption coefficient , @xmath26 and @xmath27 describes the scattering angular diagram . for a medium with gain , @xmath28 and we can also use the linear gain coefficient @xmath29 .",
    "the rte can be derived from maxwell equations  @xcite but can also be found by simple energy conservation arguments , since it is a boltzmann - type equation .    from the specific intensity",
    "one can define two other useful quantities , the radiative flux @xmath30 , which is identical to the poynting vector , and the energy density @xmath31 , which is the quantity entering into the diffusion equation : @xmath32      for a slab geometry , the random laser threshold was found from the rte using a modal decomposition  @xcite , and applied to the case of a random laser based on cold atoms  @xcite . for a sphere geometry , letokhov _ et al .",

    "interestingly , one can also simplify the threshold equations in the opposite limit of very low scattering and high gain ..    for the 3d case , if @xmath50 , we have the simplification @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for @xmath53",
    "it gives @xmath54 .",

    "[ fig.letokhov_generalise ] .",
    "very surprisingly , this result suggests that a threshold exists even without scattering , a conclusion that seems clearly unphysical , suggesting that some of the approximations made to derive the rte threshold ( see appendix a ) break down in the ballistic limit .",
    "we discuss in more detail the nature of the employed approximations in appendix b.      the shape of the intensity distribution at threshold can be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq.finale ] ) ( or its 3d equivalent ) .    in 3d one finds  @xcite @xmath61 while in 2d we obtain @xmath62    in both cases , if there is more scattering than gain , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are real and @xmath66 is bell - shaped with its maximum at @xmath67 . on the contrary , if @xmath68 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are purely imaginary and @xmath66 increases from the center ( fig .  [ fig.comparison_shape ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with what could be expected in a quasi - ballistic regime , where photons farther from the center have been in averaged more amplified .",
    "in order to compare the predictions of the rte with a more complete model , we use coherent wave calculations of the lasing threshold , which account for the effects of finite wavelengths and wave interference . due to the computational difficulty of performing such calculations on disordered media , we restrict the comparison study to 2d , using the scalar wave equation @xmath69 \\psi(\\bm{r } ) = 0 .    \\label{wave equation}\\ ] ] this describes a 2d electromagnetic mode in the transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarization , where @xmath70 is the complex scalar wavefunction corresponding to the out - of - plane component of the electric field , @xmath71 is the mode frequency , @xmath72 is the 2d laplacian , and @xmath73 is the dielectric function .",
    "the wave equation ( [ wave equation ] ) introduces an extra length scale , the wavelength @xmath74 . for comparison to the rte",
    ", we shall be interested in the regime where the wavelength is shorter than the other length scales , i.e. ,  @xmath75 .",
    "we model the random laser by uniformly distributing @xmath76 delta - function scatterers at positions @xmath77 , within a circular region of radius @xmath12 .",
    "this region also contains a uniform background of gain material , with susceptibility @xmath78 .",
    "thus , @xmath79 the parameter @xmath80 , which has units of area , determines the strength of each scatterer .",
    "the use of independent delta - function scatterers allows us to relate the model parameters to the mean free path .",
    "the density of scatterers is @xmath81 , and the 2d scattering cross section of an individual scatterer in the first born approximation is @xmath82 .",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.comparison2d ] the comparison between the data of the coherent wave model ( previous section ) and the analytical results of the diffusion ( sec .",
    "[ sec.diffusion ] ) and rte thresholds ( sec .",
    "[ sec.rte ] ) .",
    "overall , looking at fig .",
    "[ fig.comparison2d](a ) , we can observe that the wave - model and the rte thresholds are quite close to each other .",
    "moreover , the wave - model threshold becomes very close to the diffusive ones for large optical thickness @xmath98 .",
    "the fact that fully incoherent models provide here very good estimates was not obvious from the outset because the incoherent models are only expected to describe transport properties averaged over the disorder configurations . on the contrary",
    ", the coherent model selects the `` best '' mode at each realization ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.chig ] ) .",
    "this also explains why the incoherent models predict larger gain thresholds and are thus `` pessimistic '' .",
    "the discrepancy between the different models increases as the optical thickness ( @xmath99 ) decreases ( see fig .  [",
    "fig.comparison2d]b ) .    ) .",
    "the red solid line is the rte threshold computed from eq .",

    "[ eq.ballistic2d ] ) is indicated by the green dotted line .",
    "note the logarithmic scales .",
    "( b ) zoom into the diffusive and intermediate regimes ( linear scales and inverted x - axis ) . ]",
    "another important observation is that the rte threshold is significantly more accurate ( closer to the wave model ) than the threshold from the diffusion equation .",
    "for example , in the intermediate regime @xmath100 , the wave model predicts a gain threshold @xmath101 , while the rte threshold is @xmath102 and the diffusive one is @xmath103 .",
    "thus , as soon as the random laser is not deeply in the diffusive regime , the rte theory provides a significant improvement .",
    "however , in the limit of very low scattering ( ballistic , or empty disk ) , the rte model predicts a scattering - independent finite threshold .",
    "as already mentioned , this indicates a breakdown of the approximations used to derive the threshold in the rte model . on the contrary",
    ", the scattering - independent threshold of the coherent model can have a clear physical interpretation : the disk boundary creates an index mismatch with the surrounding vacuum due to the gain coefficient , and thus reflects some light , which induces some coherent feedback . in this regime ,",
    "the laser is not `` random '' and is based on whispering gallery modes .",
    "the corresponding gain threshold depends on the wavelength because the index mismatch depends on the wavelength for a fixed gain coefficient .",
    "the coherent model is thus able to describe the transition from a diffusive random laser to a `` ballistic '' , cavity - based one .",
    "the partial reflection due to the index mismatch is not included in the incoherent models .",
    "we also can compare the averaged intensity distribution of the lasing mode at threshold obtained from the wave model and the analytical profile predicted by the rte model ( see eq .",
    "[ eq.intensity_profile2d ] ) .",
    "we show in fig .",

    "these qualitatively different behaviors are well captured by the rte prediction ( dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "the agreement is even quite good in the diffusive regime .",
    "differences are more important in the quasiballistic regime .",
    "first , the gain at threshold is higher in the rte model [ fig .",
    "[ fig.comparison2d ] ] and thus the intensity increases faster than in the wave model .",
    "second , oscillations appear in the coherent model , which are a signature of interference effects due to the partial reflection at the boundary , creating an oscillatory pattern in the lasing mode .",
    "this partial reflection also contributes to increasing the intensity at the center , reducing the difference between the center and the edge .    ) ] .",
    "the vertical scale has been chosen such that @xmath107 at the center . in the diffusive regime ( @xmath105 ) , the energy is confined near the center , while in the quasiballistic regime ( @xmath106 ) it increases from the center toward the edge . ]",
    "in this article , we have studied the threshold of random lasing in a 2d disk in the crossover from the diffusive to the quasi - ballistic regimes , and we compared different models to describe this transition . the more accurate , coherent model is able to describe this system in all regimes , at the cost of computational complexity , which , in particular , limits the size and dimensionality of the system under study . in the diffusive limit ,",
    "the diffusion equation , which provides a fully incoherent description , predicts the threshold quite accurately , although interference and wave effects are neglected .",
    "moreover , an incoherent model is also available beyond the diffusive regime .",
    "this model , based on the radiative transfer equation , also provides analytical results , which agree with the full coherent model on a qualitative level , and even show quantitative agreement in the crossover regime on a level superior to the diffusive model .",
    "the radiative transfer equation also correctly predicts the global shape of the averaged intensity distribution at threshold .",
    "surprisingly , even though the incoherent model is expected to break down deep in the ballistic limit because the boundary conditions can not be treated rigorously , it predicts a random laser threshold as well as a modal intensity distribution in qualitative agreement with the coherent model . at the other extreme , the diffusion model should also break down when the mean - free path becomes comparable to the wavelength . despite these limitations ,",
    "the incoherent models are very efficient in predicting the good order of magnitude for the random laser threshold in a large range of parameters",
    ".    the comparison with experimental data would also be very interesting . in most experimentally accessible systems , however , the polydispersity of the samples and the complicated geometry due to the scattering of the pump  @xcite makes a quantitative comparison very hard .",

    "because of these approximate boundary conditions , the diffusion equation is known to be bad near the borders of the medium ( meaning at a few @xmath6 ) .    in the approach presented in sec .",
