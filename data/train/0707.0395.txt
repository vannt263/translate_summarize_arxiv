    "rotational transitions of molecular hydrogen , lying in the mid - infrared range between 5 and 30@xmath4 m ( table  [ tab_lines ] ) , provide measurements of the mass and temperature distribution of the bulk of the warm molecular gas phase , at temperatures of @xmath6 to 1000k . by contrast , the transitions from higher vibrational levels in the near - infrared , better studied because more easily observable from the ground , arise from gas at apparent excitation temperatures of more than 1000k located in a thin layer of molecular clouds , hosting a negligible fraction ( of the order of @xmath10 ) of the total h@xmath0 mass @xcite .",
    "the rotational lines are thus more appropriate tracers of molecular gas being exposed to moderate heating , and arise from a much larger volume fraction of the molecular clouds .",
    "they constitute one of the most important coolants of warm molecular gas @xcite .",
    "h@xmath0 emission lines have been detected in a wide array of sources , including outflows from young stars @xcite , photodissociation regions @xcite , planetary nebulae @xcite , supernova remnants @xcite , large regions at the centers of galaxies @xcite and extranuclear large - scale shocks in galaxy collisions @xcite .",
    "the possible excitation mechanisms are accordingly varied . in normal galaxies ,",
    "the major excitation source is expected to be the far - ultraviolet radiation of massive stars in photodissociation regions , with photon energies between 6 and 13.6ev ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "h@xmath0 molecules can be pumped by fuv photons into electronically - excited states , followed by fluorescence and radiative cascade through the vibration - rotation levels of the ground electronic state .",
    "pure fluorescent spectra are produced only if the cascade is not significantly altered by collisions with hydrogen atoms and molecules ; if the critical densities for collisional deexcitation are exceeded , a portion of the pump energy is converted to heat by collisions , and the lowest rotational levels are populated by collisions and thermalized .",
    "pure fluorescence is thus much more likely in the vibrational transitions , that have high critical densities , than in the pure rotational transitions considered here , with critical densities below a few @xmath11@xmath12 for s(0 ) to s(3 ) .",
    "additionally , fuv photons can be absorbed by dust grains , followed by the ejection of photoelectrons that heat the gas .",
    "this also results in the thermal excitation of the low - energy levels of h@xmath0 by collisions with the warm gas . besides the radiation of massive stars , a second important source of excitation is shocks , in molecular outflows , supernova remnants or cloud collisions in a disturbed gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above processes , x - rays produced in active nuclei or in supernova remnant shocks can partially ionize and heat the gas over large column densities , leading to h@xmath0 excitation by collisions with hydrogen atoms and molecules , and with fast electrons @xcite .",
    "finally , h@xmath0 molecules can be formed directly into excited states .",
    "surveys of molecular hydrogen line emission in galaxies have been so far mostly restricted to starbursts , active galactic nuclei and ultraluminous systems , and have been performed mostly in the near - infrared , targetting vibration - rotation lines that arise from upper levels with much higher excitation energies than the mid - infrared lines .",
    "it has been speculated that the major source of h@xmath0 heating in star - forming galactic nuclei was shocks in supernova remnants , based on comparison of the luminosity of some vibration - rotation h@xmath0 lines with a limited number of galactic templates and with shock models @xcite .",
    "however , scaling individual templates to the integrated emission of galaxies has large inherent uncertainties , and the near - infrared line ratios most often used to discriminate between thermal and non - thermal emission are not always sufficient to distinguish between shocks and fluorescent excitation followed by collisional deexcitation in high - density regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite surveyed starburst galaxies in several vibration - rotation lines , and found that the dominant excitation mechanism was pumping by the far - ultraviolet radiation of massive stars , rather than collisional excitation .",
    "@xcite reached the same conclusion for a small sample of ultraluminous galaxies , in which the first vibrational level is thermalized by high densities in photodissociation regions .",
    "active nuclei ( liners or seyferts ) can show an excess of h@xmath0 emission relative to hydrogen recombination lines and aromatic bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the exact nature of the additional source of excitation , namely x - ray excitation , fluorescence induced by a non - thermal ultraviolet continuum , or shocks induced by dynamical perturbations , is often unclear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is however unlikely that significant h@xmath0 emission could arise from interaction between molecular clouds and jets from seyfert nuclei @xcite .",
    "the detection of a rotational line of h@xmath0 was first reported by @xcite ( the s(2 ) transition at 12.3@xmath4 m in orion ) from observations at las campanas observatory .",
    "it was soon followed by many more ground - based detections , but the majority of data on the rotational spectrum of h@xmath0 were produced by the sws instrument on board iso ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , with previous infrared spectroscopic capabilities , observations of normal galaxies have proven difficult due to sensitivity limitations , so that our current knowledge is mainly extrapolated from studies of very bright objects , maybe not representative of the general galaxy population .",
    "the purpose of this paper is thus to extend previous work to fainter systems than formerly accessible , and to characterize directly the generic properties of the warm molecular hydrogen content of normal galaxies .",
    "the sings sample ( spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , covering a broad range of infrared luminosities , morphologies and nuclear types , is ideally suited to such a pursuit .",
    "studies of rotational lines alone , without information on vibrational levels , have very limited diagnostic value concerning the source of excitation , because the low critical densities of the rotational levels make it likely that they will be thermalized most of the time , and thus can not be used to distinguish between the various heating mechanisms . because observations of vibration - rotation transitions in the near - infrared are still scarce for normal galaxies , and because they are typically performed in apertures that are not matched to our observations , we did not attempt to include vibrational levels in our analysis .",
    "the characterization of excitation mechanisms and physical conditions in the gas would greatly benefit from such information , but would necessitate an additional dedicated survey .    the rotational lines are , however , energetically important and can characterize the temperature and density conditions of a large mass fraction of the interstellar medium in galaxies , i.e. that consisting of warm molecular gas . from a sws survey of rotational lines in nearby starburst and seyfert galaxies ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite obtained mass fractions of h@xmath0 in the warm phase of several percent .",
    "in ultraluminous galaxies observed with spitzer , @xcite derive much lower mass fractions of warm gas , but the fact that the majority of their sample has only upper limits for the s(0 ) line makes it possible that the temperatures are overestimated ( because computed from the s(1 ) to s(3 ) lines only , whenever s(0 ) is undetected ) and thus the masses of warm h@xmath0 underestimated .",
    "this paper presents observations of warm molecular hydrogen in nearby galaxies obtained as part of sings @xcite . from these data , we present quantifications of the temperatures and column densities of warm h@xmath0 encountered in kiloparsec - scale areas , mostly nuclear regions , and a comparison of the power emitted in the rotational lines with those produced by [ siii ] at 34.8@xmath4 m , which is the dominant cooling line of normal galaxies in the mid - infrared range , and by dust .",
    "we emphasize the different properties of star - forming regions and nuclei classified as liners or seyferts , and discuss their h@xmath0 excitation mechanisms .",
    "the data , analysis methods and observational results are described in sections [ data ] to [ powers ] .",
    "the interpretation of the main findings is presented in sections  [ excitation ] and [ syliner ] , and a summary of the results and conclusions can be found in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the sings sample @xcite , comprising 75 galaxies , is intended to be a valuable representative set of local galaxies that are not ultraluminous , and whose moderate distances ensure that the properties of the interstellar medium can be studied at relatively small spatial scales ( a few hundreds of parsecs at the shortest wavelengths ) .",
    "numerous sources with mild starbursts or low - luminosity active nuclei are included . of this sample",
    ", we excluded from the present study the objects that were not observed in spectroscopic mode because of their very low brightness ( ddo154 , hoi , m81dwa , m81dwb ) , or containing very little dust and nebular emission within the nuclear area mapped by the high spectral resolution modules ( the quiescent ellipticals ngc584 and ngc1404 , the quiescent dwarf galaxies ddo53 , ddo165 , hoix and the asymmetric magellanic galaxies ngc4236 , ngc5398 , ngc5408 and ic4710 ) .",
    "the dwarf galaxies ic2574 and ngc5474 were also rejected because they lack observations in some of the spectroscopic modules .",
    "of the two star - forming dwarf galaxies with several extranuclear pointings , hoii and ngc6822 , we retained only ngc6822 here ; the regions within hoii are indeed two faint to allow an analysis of the h@xmath0 excitation diagram , contrary to some regions within ngc6822 .",
    "low - mass galaxies with extranuclear pointings will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "ngc3034 ( m82 ) was excluded due to the unavailability of nuclear spectroscopy from sings , as well as ngc1377 , which constitutes a galaxy class of its own very different from the rest of the sings sample , and has been discussed separately @xcite .",
    "the sample for h@xmath0 measurements comprises 66 targets in 57 galaxies ( table  [ tab_target ] ) .",
    "the pointings are centered either on the nuclear regions ( for most targets ) or on some bright star - forming complexes ( for a few dwarf galaxies and a spiral galaxy ) .",
    "diffuse regions within galactic disks are not covered by the present study .",
    "the aperture over which we extracted the spectra is the intersection of the various areas covered by all four spectroscopic modules .",
    "the central position and solid angle of this aperture , used to measure all the quantities presented in this paper ( line and continuum fluxes ) , is listed for each galaxy in table  [ tab_target ] . in practice , the limiting size is that of the maps performed with the high - resolution modules , which were enlarged in a few cases in order to cover the emission from a star - forming circumnuclear ring . at the distances of the targets , the equivalent linear diameters of the apertures range from 60pc to 3.8kpc ( distribution shown in fig .  [ fig : diameters ] ) , and the median is 900pc .",
    "although the apertures are in general small fractions of the optical extent of the galaxies , the measurements are still averages over very large and complex areas .",
    "it is expected that a large number of disconnected star formation sites , in addition to the nucleus , contribute to the total emission .      to estimate",
    "flux densities of the dust continuum and of the aromatic bands ( also referred to as the emission from pahs , or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) , we used images in the 3.6@xmath4 m and 7.9@xmath4 m bands of the irac camera @xcite , and scan maps in the three bands of the mips instrument @xcite at effective wavelengths of 24 , 71 and 156@xmath4 m . since in early - type galaxies",
    "photospheric emission can make an important contribution to 7.9@xmath4 m fluxes , we subtracted an estimate of this component in order to obtain pure measurements of aromatic band emission . to this effect",

    "in addition , we measured the s(4 ) to s(7 ) transitions in three galaxies in which these lines are bright enough to become detectable at low spectral resolution ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) .    in high spectral resolution data , we defined errors from fluctuations of the pseudo - continuum , which was fitted as an affine function of wavelength ( @xmath23 ) . in sl data , errors at each wavelength were estimated from spatial fluctuations of blank fields within the satellite spectral maps that are automatically obtained when the source lies in the other half of the slit ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "given this uncertainty , it is conceivable that the h@xmath0 emission be twice as bright in our 800 arcsec@xmath24 aperture as in the sws aperture ; but the s(0 ) line flux of @xcite is inconsistent with our data .    for this study",
    ", we estimate total infrared fluxes ( tir ) between 3 and 1100@xmath4 m , defined as a linear combination of 24 , 71 and 156@xmath4 m flux densities .",

    "the infrared fluxes are measured within the same area as the other quantities for direct comparison .",
    "the psf width at 156@xmath4 m is however much larger than the size of our spectroscopic aperture , so that some extrapolation is needed .",
    "we first measure mips fluxes within the larger aperture used to compare total infrared fluxes with line fluxes measured in the ll module .",
    "then , we scale these fluxes by the ratio of @xmath25 measured in the small aperture to @xmath25 measured in the larger aperture , which is equivalent to assuming that the spectral energy distribution does not change from an area of @xmath26arcsec@xmath24 to an area of @xmath27arcsec@xmath24 .",

    "excitation diagrams provide a convenient visualization of the distribution of level populations and allow first constraints on the excitation mechanisms ( thermal or non - thermal ) that can produce this distribution .",

    "the apparent excitation temperature can then be derived from each pair of transitions by : @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "since both radiative decay and collisions with h@xmath0 change the rotational number @xmath44 by an even number , the ortho and para states are largely decoupled and should in principle be dealt with independently .      as emphasized by @xcite",
    ", the lower rotational levels of h@xmath0 will be in collisional equilibrium over a wide range of conditions , because their critical densities are low .",
    "figure  [ fig : ncrit ] shows the critical densities of all the rotational transitions observable with the irs instrument , as a function of temperature , computed using the functional form for the collisional de - excitation rate coefficient by h@xmath0 given by @xcite and the transition probabilities given by @xcite .",
    "the derived critical densities for each line are about an order of magnitude lower than those for collisions with h computed by @xcite , the comparison being made at 600k , since @xcite provide results only for high temperatures .",
    "the integrated emission from warm h@xmath0 in star - forming galaxies is likely to come predominantly from the densest photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) within the beam , with densities above @xmath11@xmath12 @xcite , in which case the lowest rotational levels will be thermalized .",
    "observations of starburst galaxies with iso - sws @xcite as well as ultraluminous galaxies with spitzer - irs @xcite are indeed consistent with this expectation . at first sight , the same applies to the galaxies studied here .    however , some of the excitation diagrams show departures from thermalization of ortho levels with para levels , in the sense that the apparent temperatures derived from each pair of transitions of consecutive rotational number are not monotonic as a function of upper level energy .",
    "clear examples are ngc1266 ( @xmath45k , @xmath46k and @xmath47k ) ; ngc4254 ( @xmath48k , @xmath49k and @xmath50k ) ; and ngc4631 ( @xmath51k , @xmath52k and @xmath53k ) . such deviations from thermalization can be explained by an ortho to para density ratio in the excited states apparently different from the equilibrium value .",

    "we expect the warm h@xmath0 component to suffer less extinction , on average , than the warm dust continuum , because the two emission sources will not be cospatial in general , and the regions of high optical depth will be confined to compact regions , probably more concentrated than the regions participating in h@xmath0 emission ( see the striking example of ngc1377 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite did not see any evidence for significant extinction in the rotational h@xmath0 lines of ultraluminous galaxies , although these objects are expected to have much higher optical depths than the present sample . in the absence of any quantitative constraint on the differential extinction between the dust and h@xmath0 ,",

    "extinction effects would however depress the s(1 ) and s(3 ) line fluxes with respect to s(0 ) and s(2 ) , and could thus artificially lower the derived @xmath59 . in the following , we put lower limits to @xmath59 values , when less than 3 , derived for the eight galaxies with non - zero optical depth at 10@xmath4 m .",
    "ngc3198 is the sample galaxy with the highest optical depth in the silicate feature according to @xcite , but its excitation diagram shows no sign of attenuation of the s(1 ) and s(3 ) lines relative to the others , and is consistent with @xmath65 ( fig .  [ fig : diag_temp ] ) .",
    "the second most obscured galaxy of the present sample is ngc1266 ( it also has the highest nebular extinction according to @xcite , @xmath104mag ) , for which we derive @xmath66 .",
    "if this were due to optical depth effects , then the s(3 ) line at 9.7@xmath4 m should be more attenuated than the s(1 ) line at 17.0@xmath4 m . since this would be consistent with the excitation diagram",
    ", we can not exclude that the apparently low @xmath59 value be an extinction artifact in at least this galaxy .",
    "the dissimilar behavior of the two galaxies in terms of differential extinction between h@xmath0 and the dust could then arise from different excitation mechanisms and geometries : whereas in the nuclear regions of ngc3198 , classified as purely hii , the h@xmath0 emission is presumably distributed over a large volume , the h@xmath0 emission in the liner nucleus of ngc1266 may be much more compact , and not produced by star formation processes ( see section  [ powers ] ) . for 13 galaxies with negligible silicate extinction in the spectral decomposition performed by @xcite , the excitation diagrams do imply @xmath66 , whether a constraint on the lower temperature @xmath80 is applied or not .",
    "in addition , of the 6 galaxies found to have non - zero silicate extinction and @xmath66 , three would require @xmath105 in order to obtain @xmath65 after extinction correction ( by @xmath106% for ngc1266 , by a factor @xmath107 for ngc4631 and by a factor @xmath108 for ngc5866 ) .",
    "the three others ( ngc1482 , 4536 and 6946 ) would require either @xmath105 , or very low @xmath80 temperatures ( @xmath109k ) .",
    "since it is unlikely that the optical depth toward h@xmath0 be higher than toward the dust continuum , we conclude that our finding , discussed in section  [ excitation ] , is robust against extinction effects .",

    "otherwise , we used instead the 7.9@xmath4 m map and assumed the spatial distributions of aromatic bands in emission and co(1 - 0 ) line emission to be similar at the large spatial scales corresponding to our apertures .",

    "the first one is inherent to the difficulty of matching the physical area covered by the irs integral - field measurements , from single - dish or aperture - synthesis measurements within a different beam .",
    "the second dominant source of uncertainty comes from the conversion factor of co intensities to h@xmath0 masses , assumed uniform here .",

    "in particular , the conversion factor is expected to be lower for compact and actively star - forming regions than for more diffuse and more quiescent regions .",
    "we discount here variations due to metal abundance , since we could find co measurements for only two low - metallicity targets ( ngc2915 and ngc6822_a ) .    figure  [ fig : frac_warm ] shows the mass fraction of molecular hydrogen in the warm phase ( @xmath114k ) as a function of the minimum temperature of the warm component , as determined by the lowest - energy rotational h@xmath0 lines .",

    "the dynamic range in the warm gas mass fraction is much higher than accounted for by the uncertainty on the total h@xmath0 mass .",
    "the uncertainty on the warm h@xmath0 mass for individual objects is however extremely large , owing to the degeneracy between @xmath80 , often ill - constrained by the data , and the column density .",

    "j=5 are close to thermal equilibrium ( at a single temperature of the order of 300 - 400k ) , such a component at 70k as found in the free-@xmath80 fit is unlikely to be real . because the fits where @xmath80 is unconstrained allow mass fractions in the warm phase that are sometimes unphysical ( for example for ngc2976 and ngc4826 ) , we favor the constrained fits as more plausible , but emphasize that the mass distribution at low temperatures is in general unconstrained .    in the case of constrained-@xmath80 fits",
    ", it appears that for a small set of nuclear regions classified as liners or seyferts , the warm h@xmath0 phase consists only of a very small fraction of the total mass , but heated to higher temperatures than in regions classified as purely star - forming .",

    "the h@xmath0 rotational line fluxes predicted by @xcite are nearly an order of magnitude higher than those from the older models of @xcite , because of the inclusion of photoelectric heating by pahs , a better h@xmath0 model , and a finer numerical grid near the region of h@xmath0 emission .",

    "a possible explanation is that h@xmath0 emission comes from cooler and denser regions than [ cii ] and [ oi ] , because h@xmath0 exists at higher optical depths inside the clouds than c@xmath123 and o @xcite .",
    "the difference in physical conditions could thus merely reflect a different spatial origin . besides the different locations within pdrs",

    "the dispersion in the ratio is very similar to that seen in fig .",

    "the [ siii ] power predicted by the photodissociation region model of @xcite , with the same physical conditions as above , is however smaller than observed by a factor greater than 3 , which implies either that the majority of [ siii ] emission comes from hii regions in high - metallicity nuclear regions , or that the fraction of silicon incorporated in dust grains is smaller than 90%",
    ".    only the regions b and c in ngc6822 have significantly less [ siii ] emission , with respect to h@xmath0 emission , than the nuclear regions of spiral galaxies .",
    "their h@xmath0 emission is also slightly overluminous with respect to the aromatic bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_tir]c ) .",
    "this may not be entirely attributable to a metallicity effect , decreasing the abundances of pahs and silicon , since region a ( hubblev ) has normal flux ratios , and oxygen abundances are quite uniform in ngc6822 @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is that additional excitation of h@xmath0 may be provided in regions b and c , with respect to region a , by shocks in supernova remnants ( see the more general discussion in sect .",

    "no independant evidence exists to test the existence of shocks in these regions .",
    "@xcite obtained a normal hii optical line spectrum at the center of ngc6822_c , but since their beam of 2.5 arcsec@xmath24 is only about 1% of ours , we can not rule out shock excitation .",
    "finally , given the small distance of ngc6822 , the regions covered by the irs aperture are less than 100pc in size .",
    "greater fluctuations around the average properties are thus not unexpected . at present , we are unable to decide which scenario is the most likely .      figure  [ fig : frac_tir]c shows a remarkable constancy of the power ratio of the h@xmath0 rotational lines to the aromatic bands . among the measured dust and gas observables ,",
    "pah emission provides the tightest correlation with h@xmath0 .",
    "observations of photodissociation regions have shown that the emission from aromatic band carriers and from fluorescently - excited h@xmath0 just outside photoionized regions are nearly cospatial , with h@xmath0 sometimes seen to extend slightly deeper into molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "cospatiality might be expected since both species can be excited by fuv photons .",
    "aromatic band carriers can also be excited by lower - energy photons in the ultraviolet and optical , but with smaller absorption cross - sections ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that fuv photons will dominate the excitation whenever massive stars are present .",
    "h@xmath0 is however dissociated by fuv photons between 11.3 and 13.6ev where it is not self - shielded , whereas pahs survive the absorption of these photons .",
    "therefore , in the case of relatively dense pdrs ( associated with molecular clouds ) , where collisional heating is expected to be the major origin of the h@xmath0 rotational lines , h@xmath0 emission should peak at slightly higher optical depth than aromatic bands , in the transition layer between atomic and molecular hydrogen , with @xmath135 .",
    "in addition , pahs probably can not be excited as deep into molecular clouds as h@xmath0 , because at sufficiently high densities they will be coagulated onto grain mantles on short timescales @xcite .",
    "if photodissociation regions dominate the excitation of h@xmath0 , as consistent with the above results , a tight relation between aromatic band emission and rotational h@xmath0 emission can arise only if the physical conditions in pdrs , especially the @xmath121 ratio , are relatively uniform , because h@xmath0 fluxes and pah fluxes depend in very different ways on these two parameters .",
    "the condition of relatively constant @xmath121 ratios seems verified in the present sample at least for the average emission within kiloparsec - scale regions ( see above ) .",
    "based on the modelling of [ cii ] and [ oi ] emission , @xcite proposed that a regulation of @xmath121 might be achieved at the scale of individual pdrs by expanding hii regions in pressure equilibrium with their surrounding pdrs .",
    "a correlation was previously claimed by @xcite between the 3.3@xmath4 m band and the v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line at 2.12@xmath4 m for a small sample of starburst and seyfert galaxies . the dominant source that they propose for h@xmath0 excitation , following @xcite , is however not photodissociation regions , but shocks in supernova remnants . using the shock models of @xcite to estimate the sum of the s(0 ) to s(2 ) transitions ( up to 6% of the mechanical power , assuming that its totality is dissipated in molecular clouds ) , and the population synthesis model of @xcite to estimate both the total mechanical power and the fuv luminosity from continuous star formation with a salpeter initial mass function , shocks alone are in principle able to produce a significant fraction of the observed h@xmath0 emission , but only if the efficiency of conversion of mechanical power into h@xmath0 emission is unrealistically high .",
    "the rotational line ratios are also inconsistent with shock models , which predict higher temperatures ( @xmath136k ) except for very low shock velocities ( in which case the power fraction radiated away by rotational h@xmath0 lines is lower ) .",
    "if the collective rotational line emission from shocks in supernova remnants is similar to that observed in individual objects such as 3c391 and ic443 @xcite , then this mechanism can provide only a modest fraction of the total h@xmath0 emission .",
    "in addition , if h@xmath0 emission came predominantly from supernova remnants whereas aromatic bands arise mostly in photodissociation regions , the partial deconnection between the two , both temporal and spatial , would manifest itself by a large scatter in the observed relation between h@xmath0 and pah fluxes for galaxies with diverse star formation histories , which is not observed .",
    "more recently , @xcite proposed a relation similar to that presented by @xcite , between the 7.7@xmath4 m aromatic band and the rotational s(1 ) line in starburst galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : frac_tir]c not only confirms this result for lower - luminosity galaxies , but also shows that the dispersion for the whole sample of star - forming nuclei is very small , and much smaller with the aromatic bands than with the 24@xmath4 m emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_tir]d ) , which is dominated by the continuum from transiently - heated very small grains , as well as from big grains in intense radiation fields .",
    "the quantification of the average h@xmath0 to dust power ratios and their dispersions is given in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_tir ] .",
    "the energy coupling between aromatic band carriers and h@xmath0 strongly suggests that both are excited predominantly in photodissociation regions , although they may not come from the exact same layers ( at the same optical depths within the clouds ) .",
    "we present further analysis in the next section .    a similar correlation , with a similarly small dispersion ,",
    "was observed between the [ cii ] line and aromatic band emission @xcite .",
    "this relation suggests that aromatic band carriers are the source of a major part of gas heating in photodissociation regions , via the photoelectric effect , at least at modest radiation field intensities , since [ cii ] emission is the dominant cooling channel in this case . in the narrow range of physical conditions that seem to apply",
    "if the emission from hii nuclei is interpreted in the framework of photodissociation region models ( a dynamic range in @xmath121 of only a factor 10 ) , then the same link between aromatic band carriers and h@xmath0 would follow if h@xmath0 were heated in relatively dense photodissociation regions by the pahs .",
    "our results , however , suggest that in nearly half the star - forming targets , the dominant excitation mechanism of the rotational levels may be fluorescence in low - density regions , so that ortho - para thermalization is not achieved by collisions ( see sect .",
    "[ excitation ] ) . if the lines are fluorescently excited , the cause underlying the tight relation between h@xmath0 and aromatic band emission may be that both are proportional to the incident far - ultraviolet flux which excited them .",
    "the tight association between h@xmath0 emission and aromatic bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_tir]c ) may be surprising if one assumes that a significant fraction of aromatic band emission arises from diffuse , mostly atomic regions with low radiation field intensities .",
    "the infrared emission of such clouds is often termed cirrus @xcite .",
    "if this were the case , then the scaling of pah flux with h@xmath0 flux could be explained only if a constant fraction of the total fuv flux escaped pdrs and were absorbed in the more diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "we stress that we adopt here the definition of photodissociation regions stated by @xcite : these are not restricted to the interfaces between bright hii regions and dense molecular clouds , but apply more generally to all the neutral interstellar medium illuminated by fuv photons ( with energies between 6 and 13.6ev ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : frac_pah_frac_highu ] demonstrates the great difficulty of making the idea of an important contribution from the cirrus medium consistent with the data .",

    "the dust luminosity fraction of cirrus clouds , @xmath141 , can be evaluated as @xmath142 , if one assumes that @xmath143 and @xmath144 are in constant proportion to each other .",

    "we conclude that aromatic bands are mostly associated with photodissociation regions ( illuminated by fuv photons able to provide h@xmath0 excitation ) .",
    "in addition , since pahs are excited not only by fuv photons but also by low - energy photons , the observed constancy of the h@xmath0 to pah ratio imposes some restrictions on possible variations of the radiation field hardness . assuming that cirrus clouds , i.e. pdrs with low radiation field intensities , receive appreciably softer radiation than pdrs with high radiation field intensities",

    "measurement of h@xmath0 line fluxes in quiescent regions is however challenging , because they depend steeply on the @xmath119 and @xmath120 parameters .",

    "we have seen that the h@xmath0 to far - infrared ratios are consistent with values of @xmath121 , the ratio of the average radiation field intensity to the hydrogen density in pdrs , between about 0.1 and 1 . in principle , separate constraints on @xmath119 and on @xmath120 can be obtained from the temperature distribution reflected in the h@xmath0 line ratios @xcite . given the complexity of the surveyed regions , however , the interpretation of the line ratios by comparison with models of a single pdr is severely limited .",
    "first , the emission from many distinct pdrs , presumably showing a large range of physical conditions , is averaged within the beam .",
    "second , even though the total emission in the sum of the s(0 ) to s(3 ) lines is probably dominated by pdrs , shocks also related to the star formation activity must be present , driven in particular by supernova remnants , protostellar outflows , or turbulence dissipation @xcite . since these shocks are characterized by higher rotational temperatures than pdrs , they would contribute mostly to the s(3 ) line @xcite , and in view of the observed line ratios , negligibly to the lower - lying transitions .    in both cases ,",
    "the superposition of pdrs of different conditions or of shocks induces a spread in temperatures , and as a consequence these are not reproduced by single pdr models .",

    "although the ranges in @xmath119 and @xmath120 derived from s(2)/s(0 ) have a broad overlap with those derived from s(1)/s(0 ) , the s(3)/s(1 ) ratios are inconsistent , indicating more intense radiation fields and higher densities .",
    "the least biased tracer of physical conditions in the bulk of the pdrs is thus the s(1)/s(0 ) ratio ( for galaxies with @xmath65 ) .",
    "it suggests that the average @xmath119 varies between about 100 and 5000 ( in units of @xmath122ergs@xmath111@xmath8 ) and the average @xmath120 between about 500 and @xmath147@xmath12 .",
    "it is surprising that in several objects , the s(0 ) to s(3 ) transitions are not thermalized , as indicated by deviations from an apparent @xmath59 of 3 .",
    "@xmath60 values that are different from the equilibrium value at the temperature of the h@xmath0 gas arise naturally from fluorescent excitation , if the gas density is lower than the critical density for ortho - para equilibration by collisions with h and h@xmath123 @xcite .",
    "this is because the ultraviolet absorption lines have a greater optical depth in the ortho states than in the para states , so that the ortho states at a given depth are pumped less .",

    "is predicted to be close to @xmath148 .",
    "a thorough review of the phenomenon of selective excitation and its implications for the interpretation of excitation diagrams was provided by @xcite .",
    "note that radiative decay in the electronic ground state and most collisional ( de)excitations always occur at fixed spin number and thus preserve the ortho or para state .",
    "conversion from one state to the other can be accomplished by h@xmath0 dissociation followed by reformation on dust grains , or by reactions with protons and hydrogen atoms in the gas phase .",
    "deviations from thermalization had previously remained unseen for rotational lines of extragalactic sources @xcite . in the frame of pdr excitation , values @xmath66 may be interpreted as arising in fuv - pumped gas with sufficiently low densities to prevent ortho - para equilibration by collisions .",
    "however , because this process depends on unknown timescales for gas heating , cooling , dissociation and reformation , we are unable to quantify in a simple way the implied density conditions .",
    "alternatively , it is conceivable that the emission comes from initially cold gas , that has been heated by slow shocks and has not had time to reach the equilibrium value of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "for hii nuclei , however , we have seen that photodissociation region excitation is more likely than shock heating ( sect .  [ powers ] ) .",
    "another possibility is that in a fraction of the pdrs within the beam , the photodissociation front is advancing into cold gas ( in lte at time @xmath149 with @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) , and the recently - heated gas has not yet had enough time to reach lte at time @xmath152 ( with @xmath153 and @xmath154 according to equ .",

    "the latter quantity incorporates a significant contribution from hii regions , and should be dominated by variations in radiation field intensity , rather than variations in gas density .",
    "the fact that the horizontal spread is larger in this diagram than in the diagram involving the h@xmath0 brightness supports our tentative interpretation in terms of density effects .",
    "in addition , @xmath59 does not show any variation as a function of @xmath145 , and only a weak tendency to increase with the quantity @xmath138 discussed in the previous section .",
    "both these quantities are indicators of the average radiation field intensity ; they are observed to be generally correlated with the gas density , but only weakly .",
    "although the data do not allow us to truly estimate average densities in photodissociation regions , they suggest that in a substantial number of the observed nuclear regions , the emission can be dominated by low density gas , relative to well - studied galactic pdrs and starburst galaxies .",
    "new modelling is required to quantify the conditions under which rotational lines indicate @xmath66 in pdrs .",
    "the h@xmath0 line ratios , compared with the pdr model of @xcite , do not indicate lower gas densities , on average , in galaxies with @xmath66 than in galaxies with @xmath65 .",
    "however , the densities estimated in this way are averages within the whole beam , and the densest and warmest regions have a greater weight , because they are more luminous in h@xmath0 ; if a large spread in densities exists , with both dense clumps and diffuse pdrs , an increase in the diffuse fraction may not be easily detectable in the average density , while still leaving an imprint on @xmath59 .",
    "we note that the proton density should also play an important role , since ortho - para conversion is effected by collisions with h and h@xmath123 .",
    "whether galaxies with @xmath66 have lower proton densities in molecular clouds , due to reduced ionization by cosmic rays , is in principle testable with radio continuum observations of synchrotron radiation from cosmic ray electrons .",
    "the number of sample galaxies with adequate data , at sufficiently high angular resolution , is however too small to apply this test .",
    "we have seen in section  [ extinction ] that extinction effects are unlikely to modify our results in a statistical sense .",
    "the fitted @xmath59 values are correlated with the brightness of the dust emission , in the aromatic bands , the 24@xmath4 m continuum and total infrared emission ( not shown here but similar to fig .  [ fig : opr_sb ] ) , which is a further indirect argument against extinction effects being responsible for low @xmath59 values .",
    "if extinction played a significant role , then low @xmath59 values would be seen preferentially in bright and compact regions , which is not the case .",
    "the galaxies for which we derive the lowest @xmath59 values ( and among the lowest h@xmath0 surface brightnesses , regardless of the constraint on the @xmath80 temperature ) are ngc337 , ngc1705 ( @xmath59 is a lower limit ) , ngc2915 , ngc4552 ( @xmath59 is a lower limit ) and ngc7793 .",
    "the first three are dwarf galaxies , ngc7793 a very late - type spiral and ngc4552 is a small elliptical galaxy classified as liner , with the smallest infrared brightness of the whole sample . since smaller gas densities are expected in general in dwarf galaxies than in the central regions of massive galaxies , except in blue compact dwarfs such as mrk33 , this finding is consistent with our interpretation of small @xmath59 values in terms of low density .",
    "we may also remark that in ngc1705 , which is a starburst , no ultracompact hii region was detected in the radio @xcite ; thus no conflict exists with the hypothesis that the photodissociation regions in ngc1705 have low densities .",
    "a large number of the galaxies classified as liners or seyferts deviate significantly from the relations discussed in section  [ powers ] , in having a strong excess of h@xmath0 emission with respect to all the other tracers used here , not only aromatic bands but also [ siii ] , the 24@xmath4 m flux and the total infrared emission ( fig .  [ fig : frac_tir ] ) , arguing for an alternative excitation mechanism in these galaxies .",
    "the average and dispersion of each power ratio are given separately for hii nuclei and for liner and sy nuclei in the figure caption .",
    "given these results , the quantities by which the two categories are most clearly separated are the h@xmath0 to aromatic band ratio and the h@xmath0 to [ siii ] ratio . in particular , nuclear regions with @xmath156",
    "are likely to be of the liner or sy type at the 99% confidence level .",
    "we thus define an excess of h@xmath0 emission , with respect to hii nuclei , based on the observed relation with aromatic bands .",
    "we choose as the maximal h@xmath0 power associated purely with star formation the quantity @xmath157 .",
    "aromatic band carriers are thought to be destroyed in intense radiation field environments , such as hii region cores @xcite and ionized regions around seyfert nuclei @xcite .",
    "they would however survive where h@xmath0 is not dissociated , so that an enhancement of the h@xmath0/pah ratio is more likely caused by a genuine excess of h@xmath0 emission , in conditions where pahs are not excited , rather than normal h@xmath0 emission occurring where pahs would have been destroyed .",
    "furthermore , h@xmath0 emission is seen in excess not only with respect to aromatic bands , but also with respect to [ siii ] and other dust tracers ( 24@xmath4 m and total infrared emission ) .",
    "[ siii ] emission may be depressed because the ionization state of silicon becomes higher , but the dust continuum can not be suppressed like aromatic bands .",
    "our empirical quantification of the h@xmath0 excess is intended to extract the part of h@xmath0 emission that can not originate in photodissociation regions .",
    "the excitation mechanism that is required to account for this excess , while not exciting pahs , is either x - ray irradiation or shock heating .",
    "we discuss liner and sy nuclei as a single category , because no detectable difference exists in their h@xmath0 properties .",
    "this may be expected for several reasons : small - number statistics ; the fact that the classification of low - luminosity agns can be ambiguous as it depends on the aperture size in particular ; and the fact that the source of h@xmath0 excitation might not be directly linked to the nuclear activity , as the results discussed below suggest .",
    "the idea that a nuclear x - ray source may modify the chemistry and excitation of the surrounding molecular clouds through sufficiently large column densities as to offer a convenient way to identify active nuclei hidden by dust has recently received much attention .",
    "models predict , in particular , unusual ratios of tracers of dense molecular gas @xcite , consistent with observations of ngc1068 @xcite .",
    "x - ray excitation would also manifest itself in the properties of h@xmath0 , the most abundant molecule . to test the hypothesis that the additional excitation in galaxies showing a significant excess of h@xmath0 emission with respect to aromatic bands ( figure  [ fig : frac_tir]c ) is predominantly produced by nuclear x - rays , we have compiled estimated x - ray fluxes in the 2 - 10kev band obtained from chandra observations .",
    "the data and references are summarized in table  [ tab_xrays ] .",
    "the h@xmath0 excess is shown as a function of the x - ray luminosity of the nucleus in fig .",
    "[ fig : xrays ] . here , galaxies with no h@xmath0 excess according to our definition are shown below the dashed line .",
    "the spread in figure  [ fig : xrays ] is very large .",
    "since the available x - ray measurements do not isolate the hard x - ray component , but include soft emission , a substantial part can be thermal emission from supernova remnants , as opposed to power - law emission from the activity related to a central supermassive black hole .",
    "many hii nuclei with no h@xmath0 excess indeed have x - ray luminosities that are comparable to those of liner and seyfert nuclei . on the other hand , some galaxies , in particular ngc3627 , ngc4569 and ngc5866 , are very luminous in h@xmath0 but have only modest x - ray to h@xmath0 luminosity ratios compared with other h@xmath0-excess galaxies .",
    "we shall assume a power - law spectrum with a standard photon index of @xmath158 , as adopted by @xcite , to extrapolate the total x - ray luminosity to lower photon energies . under this assumption ,",
    "the luminosity between 0.2 and 10kev is only two times the luminosity between 2 and 10kev compiled here .",
    "up to 10% of the intrinsic 1 - 10kev luminosity may emerge in the sum of all h@xmath0 transitions @xcite , whereas in our comparison we have summed only the three rotational lines s(0 ) to s(2 ) .",

    "[ fig : xrays ] does not imply a direct excitation of h@xmath0 by x - rays , since it could also be understood in the frame of multi - phase shocks , produced by supernova remnants or by starburst winds ( see below ) . from near - infrared line ratios",

    "an efficient mechanism has to be invoked to account for the h@xmath0 brightness .",
    "it has been shown recently that galactic shocks can convert a very large fraction of the kinetic energy into rotational h@xmath0 emission without producing a lot of x - rays @xcite .",
    "we thus propose that large - scale shocks play a major role .",
    "ngc3627 is an interacting galaxy in the leo triplet , characterized by severe morphological and kinematical distortions and , in the center , a massive molecular gas concentration in the form of an asymmetric bar - like structure @xcite , with a peak in the stellar velocity dispersion that is shifted by about 3  from the nucleus , and probably strong gas inflow into the nucleus @xcite .",
    "ngc4569 is a starburst liner @xcite having recently produced a large number of supernova explosions , triggering the expansion of x - ray , h@xmath161 @xcite and synchrotron emission lobes @xcite , and also has a circumnuclear ring of molecular gas with strong non - circular motions @xcite .",
    "the situation could be similar to ngc4945 , where h@xmath0 emission is seen to follow the innermost part of a starburst outflow , with an extent of @xmath162pc @xcite .",
    "these two examples thus support the idea of a dominant excitation by shocks , triggered by dynamical perturbations and by a starburst wind , respectively .    in order to test the possibility that the excess h@xmath0 emission be caused by supernova remnant shocks , we estimated the required heating efficiencies in the following way .",
    "we first computed the star formation rate required to account for the excess h@xmath0 emission , assuming constant star formation , if all the mechanical power is converted to the power emitted by the sum of the s(0 ) to s(2 ) lines ( using the starburst99 population synthesis model of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we then compared this with the star formation rate estimated from the 24@xmath4 m luminosity , using the calibration of @xcite for the same initial mass function .",
    "the ratio of the two rates gives an order - of - magnitude estimate of the h@xmath0 heating efficiency @xmath163 that is needed if supernova shocks are invoked as the dominant heating mechanism , and is shown in fig .",

    "galaxies such as ngc4450 and ngc4579 , on the other hand , unambiguously require much more power than available in supernova remnants .",

    "we may also remark that for galaxies like ngc1377 , whose dust emission is interpreted as dominated by an extremely young and opaque starburst @xcite , the above criterion to select liner and sy nuclei will not be applicable .    * shock excitation in liner / sy nuclei : * we interpret the differences in h@xmath0/pah ratios as a genuine excess of h@xmath0 emission ( and not a deficit of the other tracers while preserving h@xmath0 ) , i.e. as requiring at least one additional mechanism to excite h@xmath0 molecules with respect to pdr heating .",
    "excitation by nuclear x - rays seems implausible , as models predict much lower heating efficiencies than what would be necessary to account for the estimated h@xmath0 excess , compared with x - ray luminosities derived from chandra observations .",
    "we thus favor excess heating by large - scale shocks , caused either by the collective effect of supernov  in an aging starburst , or by dynamical perturbations .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate suggests that supernova remnant shocks can easily account for the h@xmath0 excess of a fraction of the liner and sy nuclei ( for example ngc5195 ) , but do not provide enough mechanical power for the galaxies with the highest h@xmath0/pah ratios . for the latter , shocks triggered by dynamical perturbations are the best candidate to supply the excess h@xmath0 heating . in one case ,",
    "it is conceivable that the excess h@xmath0 emission may be produced by the interaction of a nuclear jet with the interstellar medium , namely in ngc1316 ( fornaxa ) .",
    "this target has the warmest h@xmath0 of the whole sample , with no evidence for a cool ( @xmath173k ) component , the lowest mass fraction in the warm phase , and is remarkable for its large - scale radio lobes .    *",
    "ortho - para thermalization in liner / sy nuclei : * consistent with the hypothesis that the additional h@xmath0 may be caused by shocks in which ortho - para equilibration is fast , the excitation diagrams of most galaxies with excess h@xmath0 emission are consistent with ortho - para thermalization ( @xmath65 ) , with three exceptions : ngc1266 , where we have seen that the apparent @xmath66 may be a result of high optical depth toward h@xmath0 , ngc5866 and ngc4125 .",
    "note that the latter two galaxies are observed edge - on , so that @xmath66 could also be an extinction artefact ; this would however imply that the optical depth derived from the silicate bands be underestimated by large factors ( see sect .",
    "[ extinction ] ) . if excess h@xmath0 emission originated from shocks with @xmath66 in the latter two galaxies",
    ", it would imply that the gas was initially cold and had not had time to reach equilibrium .",
    "the rotational h@xmath0 lines are most often fainter than the forbidden lines in the same wavelength range , in particular [ siii ] , [ neii ] , [ neiii ] and [ siii ] ( with no example of an h@xmath0-dominated line spectrum in the present sample ) , but are among the dominant coolants of molecular gas and provide important constraints on the excitation of the warm molecular interstellar medium , where a large mass fraction of the gas resides in normal galaxies . the results presented here",
    "are assumed to be representative of moderate - luminosity galaxies of all types , and can serve as a comparison point for future studies of distant galaxies .    support for this work ,",
    "part of the spitzer space telescope legacy science program , was provided by nasa through an award issued by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",

    "<S> results on the properties of warm molecular hydrogen in 57 normal galaxies are derived from measurements of h@xmath0 rotational transitions in the mid - infrared , obtained as part of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) . </S>",
    "<S> this study extends previous extragalactic surveys of emission lines of h@xmath0 , the most abundant constituent of the molecular interstellar medium , to fainter and more common systems ( @xmath1 to @xmath2l@xmath3 ) of all morphological and nuclear types . in our sensitive integral - field observations covering kiloparsec - scale areas , </S>",
    "<S> the 17@xmath4 m s(1 ) transition is securely detected in the nuclear regions of 86% of sings galaxies with stellar masses above @xmath5m@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the derived column densities of warm h@xmath0 ( with temperatures above @xmath6k ) , even though averaged over large areas , are commensurate with values observed in resolved photodissociation regions ; the median of the sample is @xmath7@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> they amount to a significant fraction of the column densities of total molecular hydrogen , between 1% and more than 30% . </S>",
    "<S> the power emitted in the sum of the three lowest - energy transitions is on average 30% of the power emitted in the bright [ siii ] cooling line ( 34.8@xmath4 m ) , and represents about @xmath9 of the total infrared power within the same area for star - forming galaxies , which is consistent with excitation in photodissociation regions . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the h@xmath0 line intensities scale tightly with the emission in the aromatic bands , even though the average radiation field intensity within the same area varies by a factor ten , can also be understood if both tracers originate predominantly in photodissociation regions , either dense or diffuse . </S>",
    "<S> a large fraction of the 25 targets classified as liners or seyferts , however , strongly depart from the rest of the sample , in having warmer h@xmath0 in the excited states , smaller mass fractions of h@xmath0 in the warm phase , and an excess of power emitted in the rotational transitions with respect to aromatic bands , the total infrared emission and the [ siii ] line . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a threshold in h@xmath0 to aromatic band power ratios , allowing the identification of low - luminosity agns by an excess h@xmath0 excitation . </S>",
    "<S> a dominant contribution from shock heating is favored in these objects . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we detect in nearly half the star - forming targets , in particular in low - density central regions of late - type galaxies , non - equilibrium ortho to para ratios , consistent with the effects of pumping by far - ultraviolet photons combined with incomplete ortho - para thermalization by collisions , or possibly non - equilibrium photodissociation fronts advancing into cold gas . </S>"
