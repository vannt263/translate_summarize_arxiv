    "there has recently been renewed interest @xcite- @xcite in the low energy scalar sector of qcd .",
    "especially , many physicists now believe in the existence of the light , broad @xmath1 resonance , sigma in the 500 - 600 mev region .",
    "the sigma is also very likely the `` tip of an iceberg '' which may consist of a nonet of light non @xmath2 - type scalars @xcite mixing @xcite with another heavier @xmath3 - type scalar nonet as well as a glueball .    a variety of different approaches to meson - meson scattering",
    "have been employed to argue for a picture of this sort . for our present purpose ,",
    "first consider an approach to describing @xmath4 , @xmath1 scattering which is based on a conventional non - linear chiral lagrangian of pseudoscalar and vector fields augmented by scalar fields also introduced in a chiral invariant manner @xcite .",
    "the experimental data from threshold to a bit beyond 1 gev can be fit by computing the tree amplitude from this lagrangian and making an approximate unitarization .",
    "the following ingredients are present : i ) the `` current algebra '' contact term , ii ) the vector meson exchange terms , iii ) the unitarized @xmath5(560 ) exchange terms and iv ) the unitarized @xmath6(980 ) exchange terms .",
    "although the @xmath7(770 ) vector meson certainly is a crucial feature of low energy physics , it is amusing to note that a fit can be made @xcite in which the contribution ii ) is absent .",
    "this results in a somewhat lighter and broader sigma meson , in agreement with other approaches which neglect the effect of the @xmath7 meson .    for the purpose of checking this strong interaction calculation ,",
    "the meson - meson scattering was also calculated in a general version of the _ linear _",
    "su(3 ) sigma model , which contains both @xmath5(560 ) and @xmath8 candidates @xcite .",
    "the procedure adopted was to calculate the tree amplitude and then to unitarize , without introducing any new parameters , by identifying the tree amplitude as the k - matrix amplitude .",
    "this also gave a reasonable fit to the data , including the characteristic ramsauer - townsend effect which flips the sign of the @xmath8 resonance contribution .",
    "at a deeper and more realistic level of description in the linear sigma model framework , one expects two different chiral multiplets - @xmath2 as well as @xmath9 - to mix with each other .",
    "a start on this model seems encouraging @xcite .",
    "now , if we restrict attention to the energy range from threshold to about 800 mev [ before the @xmath8 becomes important ] the data are well fit by the simple su(2 ) linear sigma model @xcite , when unitarized by the k - matrix method @xcite .",
    "if one further restricts attention to the energy range from @xmath4 threshold to about 450 mev , the data can be fit by using the non - linear su(2 ) sigma model @xcite , which contains only pion fields at tree or one loop ( chiral perturbation theory ) level . to get a description of the sigma resonance region by using only chiral perturbation theory",
    "@xcite would seem to require a prohibitively large number of loops ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the lessons we draw are , first , that the _ prescription _ of using the k - matrix unitarized su(2 ) linear sigma model provides one with a simple explanation of the scalar sector of qcd in its non - perturbative low energy region . secondly , the sigma particle of this model is not necessarily just a @xmath10 bound state in the underlying fundamental qcd theory .",
    "rather the linear su(2 ) sigma model seems to be a `` robust '' framework for describing the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "there are just two parameters .",
    "one may be taken to be the vacuum value of the sigma field ; this is proportional to the `` pion decay constant '' and sets the low energy scale for the theory .",
    "the second may be taken to be the `` bare '' mass of the sigma particle ; as its value increases the theory becomes more strongly interacting and hence non - perturbative .",
    "the k - matrix unitarization gives a physically sensible prescription for this non - perturbative regime wherein the model predicts the `` physical '' mass of the sigma to be significantly smaller than the `` bare '' mass .",
    "there is in fact a maximum predicted `` physical '' mass as the `` bare '' mass is varied .",
    "now it is well known that the higgs sector of the standard electroweak model is identical to the su(2 ) linear sigma model of mesons .",
    "the sigma corresponds to the higgs boson while the @xmath13 and @xmath14 appear eventually , in the unitary gauge , as the longitudinal components of the @xmath15 and z bosons .",
    "there is an important difference of scale in that the vacuum expectation value of the higgs boson field is about 2656 times that of the `` qcd sigma '' .",
    "however , once the bare masses of the two theories are scaled to their corresponding vev s , one can formally treat both applications of the same model at once .",
    "the practical significance of comparing these two applications is enhanced by the goldstone boson equivalence theorem @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this theorem has the implication that , for energies where @xmath16 is small , the important physical amplitudes involving longitudinal w and z bosons are given by the corresponding amplitudes of the sub - lagrangian of the electroweak theory obtained by deleting everything except the scalar fields ( massless `` pions '' and massive higgs boson ) .",
    "thus , except for rescaling , the electroweak amplitudes may be directly given by the pion amplitudes computed for qcd with varying bare sigma mass .",
    "there is no reason why the scaled higgs boson mass should be the same as the scaled `` qcd sigma '' mass since , while the two lagrangians agree , the scaled bare mass is a free parameter .",
    "a simple and perhaps most important point of the present paper is that the same model which appears to effectively describe the higgs sector of the electroweak model can be used , with the k matrix prescription to describe the non - perturbative scalar sector of qcd _ in agreement with experiment_. in fact , the k - matrix method of unitarization is a popular @xcite-@xcite approach to the non- perturbative regime of the electroweak model , although it is not easy to rigorously justify",
    ". we will see that the qcd sigma meson has about the same scaled mass as a higgs boson of 2 tev .",
    "this provides a practical justification of the use of the k - matrix procedure up to that value at least .",
    "in fact the successful addition of the @xmath8 resonance to the low energy sigma using the linear su(3 ) sigma model and the same unitarization scheme suggests that the range of validity of the electroweak treatment is even higher .",
    "it also suggests that the same method should also work in models which have more than one higgs meson in the same channel .",
    "furthermore , we will note that , treating the unitarized model as a `` prescription '' , even the bare mass going to infinity is a sensible limit .",
    "a leading experimental question at the moment concerns the actual mass of the higgs particle .",
    "direct experimental search @xcite rules out values less than about 115 gev .",
    "indirect observation via a `` precision '' global analysis of all electroweak data including the effects of virtual higgs boson exchange in loop diagrams actually gives a preferred central value of about 80 gev @xcite .",
    "however there are unexplained `` precision '' effects like the nutev experiment on @xmath17 neutrino scattering off nucleons @xcite and the measurement of the invisible z width at lep / slc @xcite which raise doubts about what is happening .",
    "for example in ref @xcite , the authors suggest the possibility of explaining these two effects by reducing the strength of neutrino couplings to the z boson . in that case",
    ", they find a new overall fit which prefers rather large higgs masses , even up to about 1 tev .",
    "this is somewhat speculative but does make it timely to revisit the large mass higgs sector and the consequent need for unitarity corrections .    in the present paper , after giving some notation in section ii , we review in section iii the fit to low energy @xmath1 @xmath4 scattering obtained with the k - matrix unitarized su(2 ) linear sigma model amplitude and its extension to higher energies using an su(3 ) linear sigma model .",
    "this establishes a preferred value for the bare mass of the `` qcd sigma '' and shows it to be in the non - perturbative region of the linear sigma model .",
    "the physical mass and width , obtained from the pole position in the complex s plane , differ appreciably from their `` bare '' or tree level values .",
    "this effect is explored in section iv for a full range of sigma `` bare '' mass values , which can be rescaled to arbitrary choices of bare higgs mass in the electroweak theory .",
    "the difference between zero and non - zero pion mass is also shown to be qualitatively small .",
    "further , the existence of a maximum value for the physical sigma mass is displayed .    in section",
    "v , using the equivalence theorem , we discuss the scattering in the @xmath1 ( higgs ) channel of longitudinal gauge bosons for the complete range of bare higgs masses .",
    "this provides the characteristic factor in the proposed `` w - fusion '' mechanism @xcite for higgs production , although here we will mainly regard it as a `` thought experiment '' .",
    "some of this material has already been given by other workers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one feature which is perhaps treated in more detail here is the peculiar behavior of the scattering amplitude for large bare higgs mass values .",
    "we note that it can be thought of as an evolution to the characteristic bare mass @xmath18 infinity shape .",
    "this shape is shown to be simply the k - matrix unitarized amplitude of the _ non linear sigma model_. in other words , taking the bare mass to infinity in the k - matrix unitarized amplitude effectively `` integrates out '' the sigma field .",
    "we also show that the magnitude of the scattering amplitude always peaks at the _ bare _ higgs mass . for values greater than about 3 tev ,",
    "the width is so great that the peaking is essentially unobservable .    in section",
    "vi we discuss the characteristic factor for the `` gluon fusion '' reaction @xcite , which is another possible source of higgs boson production .",
    "unlike the w - fusion reaction , this involves final state interactions rather than unitarization .",
    "we point out that in our model the magnitude of the gluon - fusion factor peaks at the _ physical _ higgs mass rather than at the bare higgs mass found in the w - fusion case .",
    "it seems to present an amusing example showing how the production mechanism of the higgs boson can influence its perceived properties .",
    "finally some concluding remarks and directions for future work are offered .",
    "first let us make a correspondence between the notations employed for the @xmath19 linear sigma model used to model low energy qcd and to model the higgs sector of the minimal standard @xmath20 electroweak theory . in the latter case the higgs sector by itself possesses @xmath21 symmetry which is explicitly broken when the gauge bosons and fermions are taken into account . in the low energy qcd application the lagrangian density",
    "is written in terms of the pion and sigma as @xmath22 where the real parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are both taken positive to insure spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .",
    "the vacuum value @xmath25 of the @xmath5 field is related to the pion decay constant as @xmath26 ( in the low energy qcd model , @xmath27 gev ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the tree level value of the sigma mass .",
    "finally the dimensionless parameter @xmath24 , whose value furnishes a criterion for the applicability of perturbation theory , is related to other quantities as @xmath30    the higgs sector of the standard model employs the fields @xmath31 these can be rewritten in terms of the @xmath32 and @xmath5 fields by identifying @xmath33 in this language the same lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ lsmlag ] ) is written @xmath34 here one employs the notation @xmath35 so that , noticing eq .",
    "( [ identification ] ) @xmath36 ( in the electroweak theory , @xmath37 tev , about 2656 times the value in the low energy qcd case ) .",
    "now let us consider the su(2 ) linear sigma model in eq .",
    "( [ lsmlag ] ) as a `` toy model '' for the scattering of two pions in the s - wave iso - singlet channel .",
    "it has been known for many years that this gives a good description of the low energy scattering near threshold in the limit of large sigma mass .",
    "of course , the non - linear sigma model is more convenient for chiral perturbation theory calculations .",
    "however we are going to focus on the properties of the sigma here and the simple linear sigma model is appropriate for this purpose .",
    "the i = j=0 partial wave amplitude at tree level is    @xmath38_{\\rm tree}(s ) =   \\alpha \\left ( { s } \\right ) + \\frac{\\beta ( s)}{m_{\\sigma b}^2 - s } \\label{pipiampl}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\beta ( s ) & = & \\frac { 3 \\sqrt { 1 - \\frac{4m_\\pi^2}{s}}}{16 \\pi f_\\pi^2 }    { \\left ( { m_{\\sigma b}^2 } - { m_\\pi}^2 \\right)}^2 . \\label{alphabeta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for generality we have added the effect of a non - zero pion mass which would correspond to the addition of a small term linear in @xmath5 to eq . ( [ lsmlag ] ) . the normalization of the amplitude @xmath40 is given by its relation to the partial wave s - matrix @xmath41 the formula above is not , of course , new ; we are following here the notations of @xcite , which contains many references .",
    "while this tree - level formula works well at threshold it does involve large coupling constants and can not be expected to be a priori reasonable even several hundred mev above threshold . in addition , at the point @xmath42 , the amplitude eq .",
    "( [ pipiampl ] ) diverges .",
    "a usual solution to this problem is to include a phenomenological width term in the denominator by making the replacement : @xmath43 however this standard approach is not a good idea in the present case . as emphasized especially by achasov and shestakov @xcite , the replacement eq .",
    "( [ conventionalreg ] ) completely destroys the good threshold result .",
    "this is readily understandable since the threshold result is well known to arise from a nearly complete cancellation between the first and second terms of eq .",
    "( [ pipiampl ] ) .",
    "an advantage of the non - linear sigma model is that the good threshold result is obtained directly without need for such a delicate cancellation .",
    "however , the pole in the linear sigma model can be successfully handled by using , instead of eq .",
    "( [ conventionalreg ] ) , k - matrix regularization @xcite , which instructs us to adopt the manifestly unitary form @xmath44_{\\rm tree}(s ) } { 1 - i \\left[{t^{0}_{0}}\\right]_{\\rm tree } ( s ) }   \\label{regularization}\\ ] ] using eq .",

    "elsewhere it provides a unitarization of the theory which is seen to have the general structure of a `` bubble - sum '' .",
    "we will adopt this very simple model as a provisional approximation for the strong coupling regime of qcd in the i = j=0 channel .",
    "it seems difficult to rigorously justify this as an effective procedure for the strong coupling regime .",
    "however we may at least compare with the experimental data on @xmath0 scattering @xcite .",
    "since @xmath47 is known there is only a single parameter - the tree - level mass @xmath29 . in fig .",
    "[ finalsu2lsmramp ] , the experimental curve for the real part @xmath48 of @xmath40 is plotted up to about @xmath49 gev .",
    "predictions for @xmath50 and 1.0 gev are also shown .",
    "it is seen that the data up to roughly @xmath51 gev can be fit when @xmath29 lies in the 0.8 - 1.0 gev range .",
    "thus , perhaps surprisingly , the simple model does a reasonable job of accounting for the low energy , but not just the linear threshold region , s - wave @xmath52 scattering data .",
    "this circumstance enhances the plausibility of the model based on the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lsmlag ] ) together with the unitarization scheme of eq .",
    "( [ tregularization ] ) .",
    "there still may be some lingering doubt because the energy region between about 0.8 and 1.2 gev is not at all fit by the model .",
    "however this is due to the neglect of a second scalar resonance which is expected to exist in low energy qcd . as shown recently in @xcite if the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lsmlag ] ) is `` upgraded '' to the three - flavor case @xcite-@xcite ( so that another scalar field @xmath53 identifiable with the @xmath8 is contained ) the entire region up to about @xmath49 gev can be reasonably fit .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ finalsu3lsmnrpipiamp ] ; in obtaining this fit the value @xmath54 gev was selected .",
    "two other parameters , @xmath55 gev and a @xmath56 mixing angle were also determined in the fit .",

    "( [ tregularization ] ) was employed .    in assessing the validity of this approximate model for low energy qcd one",
    "should also consider the role of the vector mesons .",
    "these are known to be important in many low energy processes and give the dominant contributions to the `` low energy constants '' @xcite of the chiral perturbation theory expansion .",
    "nevertheless it was found @xcite that , while rho meson exchange does make a contribution to low energy s - wave pion pion scattering , its inclusion does not qualitatively change the properties of the light @xmath5 resonance which seems crucial to explain the i = j=0 partial wave . more specifically , the effect of the rho meson raises the @xmath5 mass by about 100 mev and lowers its width somewhat .",
    "it also seems worthwhile to remark that this unitarized linear sigma model approach gives similar results to a more conventional non - linear sigma model approach @xcite wherein the scalar mesons are included explicitly . in order to get the effects of the vector and axial vector mesons in the linear sigma model framework one",
    "should also add them explicitly in a chiral symmetric manner ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us ask : how non - perturbative is the linear sigma model when it is employed as an approximation to low energy qcd ?",
    "the ordinary criterion for the model to be deep in the non - perturbative region is that the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath24 in eq .",

    "we note that the behavior is qualitatively similar .    in fig .",
    "4 , we show how @xmath73 depends on the choice of @xmath29 for low energy qcd .",
    "one sees that the real and imaginary pieces of @xmath63 are bounded .",

    "of course , many people consider this portion to be the least well established aspect of the electroweak theory .",
