    "the ensemble dynamics of self - driven particles can differ significantly from those of brownian random walkers @xcite .",

    "e. coli _ bacteria preferentially migrated to the chamber towards which the funnels pointed @xcite even though brownian particles would have remained equally distributed in both chambers .",
    "a simple simulation model showed that the rectification arises due to the modification of the run - and - tumble swimming dynamics of the bacteria by the walls of the microenvironment @xcite .",
    "when a running bacterium encounters a wall , it does not reflect away from the wall or immediately tumble , but swims in the direction of the wall while preserving as much as possible its prior direction of motion .",
    "refs . @xcite and @xcite found rectification under this interaction rule for independent swimmers that did not interact with each other .",
    "the rectification in the bacteria system resembles a ratchet effect in which a net dc motion occurs in the absence of a dc drive due to the application of an external ac drive or flashing substrate @xcite . for self - driven particles ,",
    "however , no external driving is necessary .",
    "in addition to demonstrations of directed bacterial motion achieved through a ratchet mechanism @xcite , it has also been shown that baths of swimming bacteria can induce directed rotational motion of asymmetric flywheels @xcite .",

    "these models qualitatively reproduce the motion of both macro - scale groups , such as fish schools and bird flocks @xcite , and micro - scale groups , such as bacterial swarms and cancerous tumors @xcite .",
    "the original vicsek model includes only a term for preferential velocity alignment with all neighbors within a fixed flocking radius , yet it exhibits a phase transition to unidirectional motion as a function of particle density and noise amplitude .",
    "although numerous modifications of the vicsek model have been proposed , such as the addition steric interactions @xcite and/or cohesion @xcite , only a very limited amount of work has been done on the interaction of flocking particles with walls or barriers .",
    "walls can impose a directional symmetry breaking @xcite , induce the formation of a vortex state @xcite or laning @xcite , or simply serve as aggregation focal points @xcite ; walls have also been used for understanding finite size effects @xcite , such as the relationship between the collective dynamics of fish in a tank and those of fish in the open ocean .    in this work",
