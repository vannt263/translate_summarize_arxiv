    "a novel approach which exploits the geometry of extra spacetime dimensions has been recently proposed@xcite as a means to resolving the hierarchy problem . in one such scenario due to arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali ( add)@xcite ,",
    "the apparent hierarchy is generated by a large volume for the extra dimensions . in this case , the fundamental planck scale in @xmath2-dimensions , @xmath3 , can be brought down to a tev and is related to the observed 4-d planck scale through the volume @xmath4 of the compactified dimensions , @xmath5 . in an alternative scenario due to randall and sundrum ( rs)@xcite , the observed hierarchy is created by an exponential warp factor which arises from a 5-dimensional non - factorizable geometry .",
    "an exciting feature of these approaches is that they both afford concrete and distinctive phenomenological tests@xcite .",
    "furthermore , if these theories truly describe the source of the observed hierarchy , then their signatures should appear in experiment at the tev scale .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the detailed phenomenology that arises in the non - factorizable geometry of the rs model .",
    "we will examine the cases where the standard model ( sm ) gauge and matter fields can propagate in the additional spacial dimension , denoted as the bulk , as well as being confined to ordinary 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "the broad phenomenological features of the latter case were spelled out in ref .",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "we expand on this previous work by considering the effects in precision electroweak observables and investigating a wider range of collider signatures , including the case of lighter graviton kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations .",
    "we also show that the lhc can probe the full parameter space of this model and hence will either discover or exclude it if the scale of electroweak physics on the 3-brane is less than 10 tev .",
    "the experimental signatures of the former scenario , where the sm fields reside in the bulk , are considered here for the first time . as we will see below",
    ", this possibility introduces an additional parameter , given by the 5-dimensional mass of the fermion fields , which has a dramatic influence on the phenomenological consequences and yields a range of experimental characteristics .",
    "while the general features of these signatures remain indicative of this type of geometry , the various details of the different cases can be taken to represent a wide class of possible models similar in nature to the rs scenario .",
    "we also present an argument which shows that spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking must be confined to the standard model 3-brane .",
    "the randall - sundrum model consists of a 5-dimensional non - factorizable geometry based on a slice of ads@xmath6 space with length @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the compactification radius .",
    "two 3-branes , with equal and opposite tensions , rigidly reside at @xmath9 orbifold fixed points at the boundaries of the ads@xmath6 slice , taken to be @xmath10 .",
    "the 5-dimensional einstein s equations permit a solution which preserves 4-dimensional poincar ' e invariance with the metric ds^2=e^-2()_dx^dx^- r_c^2d^2 , where the greek indices extend over ordinary 4-d spacetime and @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the ads@xmath6 curvature scale which is of order the planck scale and is determined by the bulk cosmological constant @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the 5-dimensional planck scale .",
    "the 5-d curvature scalar is then given by @xmath15 .",
    "examination of the action in the 4-d effective theory yields the relation",
    "^2=m_5 ^ 3k(1-e^-2kr_c ) for the reduced 4-d planck scale .",
    "the scale of physical phenomena as realized by the 4-d flat metric transverse to the 5th dimension @xmath16 is specified by the exponential warp factor .",
    "tev scales can naturally be attained on the 3-brane at @xmath17 if gravity is localized on the planck brane at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the scale of physical processes on this tev - brane is then @xmath20 .",
    "the observed hierarchy is thus generated by a geometrical exponential factor and no other additional large hierarchies appear .",
    "it has been demonstrated@xcite that this value of @xmath21 can be stabilized without the fine tuning of parameters by minimizing the potential for the modulus field , or radion , which describes the relative motion of the 2 branes . in the original construction of the rs model utilizing this stabilization mechanism , gravity and the modulus stabilization field",
    "may propagate freely throughout the bulk , while the sm fields are assumed to be confined to the tev ( or sm ) brane at @xmath17 .",
    "the 4-d phenomenology of this model is governed by only two parameters@xcite , given by the curvature @xmath12 and .",
    "the radion , which receives a mass during the stabilization procedure , is expected to be the lightest new state and admits an interesting phenomenology@xcite which we will not consider here .",
    "this scenario has enjoyed immense popularity in the recent literature , with the cosmological / astrophysical @xcite , string theoretic@xcite , and phenomenological implications all being explored .",
    "we note that similar geometrical configurations have previously been found to arise in m / string theory@xcite .",
    "in addition , extensions of this scenario where the higher dimensional space is non - compact@xcite , , @xmath22 , as well as the inclusion of additional spacetime dimensions and branes@xcite have been discussed .",
    "given the success of the rs scenario , it is logical to ask if it can be extended to include other fields in the bulk besides gravity and the modulus stabilization field .",
    "it would appear to be more natural for all fields to have the same status and be allowed to propagate throughout the full dimensional spacetime .",
    "in addition , garriga @xcite have recently shown that the casimir force of bulk matter fields themselves may be able to stabilize the radion field . in the case of",
    "non - warped , toroidal compactification of extra dimensions , bulk gauge fields can lead to an exciting phenomenology which is accessible at colliders@xcite .",
    "the possibility of placing gauge fields in the bulk of the rs model was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the couplings of the kk gauge bosons are greatly enhanced in comparison to those of the sm by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "an analysis of their contributions to electroweak radiative corrections was found to constrain the mass of the first kk gauge boson excitation to be in excess of 25 tev , implying that the physical scale of the @xmath17 brane , @xmath24 , must exceed 100 tev . by itself , if the model is to be relevant to the hierarchy problem with @xmath24 being near the weak scale , this disfavors the presence of sm gauge fields alone in the rs bulk .",
    "this endeavor has recently been extended to consider fermion bulk fields .",
    "grossman and neubert@xcite investigated this possibility in an effort to understand the neutrino mass hierarchy . using their results , kitano@xcite demonstrated that bounds on flavor changing processes such as @xmath25 also force the kk gauge bosons to be heavy for neutrino yukawa couplings of order unity .",
    "subsequently , chang @xcite demonstrated that placing fermion fields in the bulk allowed the zero - mode fermions , which are identified with the sm matter fields , to have somewhat reduced couplings to kk gauge fields .",
    "this allows for a weaker constraint on the value of  from precision electroweak data .",
    "gherghetta and pomarol@xcite have noted the importance of the value of the bulk fermion mass in determining the zero - mode fermion couplings to both bulk gauge and wall higgs fields and found interesting implications for the fermion mass hierarchy and supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in this paper we expand upon these studies and examine the phenomenological implications of placing the sm gauge and matter fields in the bulk .",
    "( in all cases to be discussed below , the backreaction on the metric due to the new bulk fields will be neglected . )",
    "we find that this possibility introduces an additional parameter , given by the 5-dimensional fermion mass , which governs the phenomenology . in the next section we peel the sm field content off the tev - brane , or wall , and derive the kk spectrum and couplings of gravitons , bulk gauge fields , and bulk fermions .",
    "the 5-d fermion mass dependence of the couplings of the kk states to the zero - mode fermions is explicitly demonstrated . in section 3",
    ", we explore the phenomenology associated with allowing the sm fields to propagate in the additional dimension .",
    "we delineate the broad phenomenological features as a function of the bulk fermion mass and find that there are four distinct classes of collider signatures .",
    "we investigate these signatures and also compute the kk gauge contributions to electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "we find that the stringent precision electroweak bounds on  discussed above are significantly relaxed for a sizable range of the fermion bulk mass parameter . in section 4 ,",
    "we expand on our previous work@xcite and examine the phenomenology in detail for the scenario where the sm fields all reside on the tev - brane .",
    "section 5 consists of our conclusions .",
    "appendix a contains an independent argument for confining the higgs fields to the tev - brane .",
    "lastly , simplified expressions for a number of couplings as a function of the fermion bulk mass are given in appendix b for the case when the sm field content propagates in the bulk .",
    "in order to examine the phenomenological implications of placing the field content of the sm in the bulk of the rs model , we need to know the properties of various bulk fields . in this section",
    ", we review the kk reduction and interactions of massless gravitons and bulk gauge fields , as well as bulk fermions with arbitrary 5-d masses , and establish the notation that will be used in the sections that follow . throughout our discussion",

    "the @xmath186 for the gauge kk fields were computed in the previous section and are given in appendix b. a global fit to the most recent electroweak data as presented at moriond 2000@xcite for the observables listed above , results in somewhat stronger bounds on the quantity @xmath189 than those obtained earlier@xcite , mainly due to the new value of @xmath182 @xcite employed in the fit .",
    "the resulting lower bound on the mass of the first gauge kk state as a function of @xmath105 is shown in fig .",
    "using the mass relationships given in the previous section between the gauge , graviton , and fermion kk excitations , we can translate this bound into constraints on the masses of the other first tower members as well ; this is also displayed in the figure . note that as @xmath105 becomes large and positive we reproduce the constraint computed in ref .",

    "the general @xmath105 dependent behavior of these constraints can be easily understood from the values of @xmath192 shown in fig .",
    "recall that for @xmath159 , the gauge tower couplings are small and approximately @xmath105 independent , while for @xmath193 , the tower couplings grow rapidly with increasing values of @xmath105 . hence , the precision electroweak bounds on the first tower states are rather weak and @xmath105 independent with @xmath194 gev for @xmath159 , and disappear completely for @xmath161 , but grow rapidly with increasing values of @xmath105 reaching the multi - tev region",
    ".    while almost all of the observables used in the electroweak fit described above are @xmath105-dependent since fermion couplings are directly involved , one is not , namely the mass of the @xmath177 .",
    "hence , one might be tempted to obtain a @xmath105-independent bound by using just this quantity alone .",
    "unfortunately , a useful limit can not be obtained using this single observable without a priori knowledge of the higgs boson mass . as was shown in the analysis of rizzo and wells@xcite for higgs fields on the wall , the existence of kk tower states for both the @xmath177 and @xmath178 gauge fields will lead to a predicted increase in @xmath180 for a fixed value of the higgs mass when",
    "@xmath195 is used as input . however",
    ", this increase in @xmath180 due to kk excitations can always be offset by a compensating increase in the higgs mass which in turn lowers @xmath180 due to loop effects .",

    "once the higgs mass is known , however , a @xmath105-independent bound can be obtained .",
    "this point has recently been emphasized by kane and wells@xcite .",

    "it is clear from the results shown in figures 2 , 3 , and 4 that four distinct regions , corresponding to specific ranges of @xmath105 , emerge , yielding four different classes of phenomenology .",
    "this is described in fig .",
    "region i corresponds to the range @xmath197 to @xmath198 , where the lower boundary is set by not allowing the fermion yukawa couplings to be fine - tuned , as discussed in the previous section . here ,",
    "the sm fermions have decoupled from the graviton kk tower and are only very weakly coupled to the gauge kk states .",
    "( recall that the sm gauge fields only interact weakly with to the graviton kk states , with the coupling strength being @xmath199 , independently of the value of @xmath105 . )",
    "the precision electroweak bounds give constraints on gauge and graviton kk masses that are less than 1 tev .",
    "in region ii with @xmath200 , the fermionic couplings of the gauge kk tower grow weaker , yielding an almost non - existent bound from precision electroweak data .",
    "the corresponding graviton kk tower - fermion interaction strength increases two orders of magnitude within this range , but remains small .",
    "note that constraints from the precision electroweak parameter @xmath189 disappear completely at @xmath161 , as the fermions and gauge kk states completely decouple at that point . in region",
    "iii , defined by @xmath201 , the fermionic couplings of both the gauge and graviton towers grow rapidly and the limits from @xmath189 on the masses of the first excitations lie in the few tev range .",
    "lastly , in region iv , corresponding to @xmath202 , the bound from @xmath189 is so strong that direct production of the kk excitations of either the gauge bosons or gravitons is kinematically forbidden at any planned collider",
    ". their only influence in this region will be through contact interaction effects .    before discussing the details of the collider phenomenology associated with the graviton and gauge kk states in these various regions ,",
    "we note that we will assume for simplicity that the gauge kk states are sufficiently massive so that mixing effects can be neglected . in general , the masses of the excitations of each gauge kk tower are given by the diagonalization of a mixing matrix , whose off - diagonal elements are proportional to the mass of the zero - mode kk state .",
    "hence , the excitations for the photon and gluon towers are automatically diagonalized and the masses of the kk states of the @xmath177 and @xmath178 towers are shifted by @xmath203 .",
    "this is a small effect for heavy kk states and hence we assume that the members in the @xmath178 , @xmath177 , photon and gluon towers are highly degenerate , level by level .",
    "this implies that the @xmath178 and @xmath204 tower members strongly interfere with one another appearing as a single resonance , @xmath205 , and are hence not separable at colliders .",
    "this scenario is also realized in the historically more conventional kk gauge analyses@xcite with flat spacetime .",
    "it is instructive to first examine the dependence of the graviton branching fractions on the fermion bulk mass parameter .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows these branching fractions for the first graviton excitation with a mass of 1 tev . in regions",
    "i and ii , we see that the primary decay mode , by approximately two orders of magnitude , is that of a pair of higgs bosons !",
    "the decay rates into more conventional channels , such as dijets , are uncharacteristically tiny and hence the usual signatures for graviton production will be altered . in regions",
    "iii and iv ,",
    "the fermions are no longer decoupled allowing for large branching fractions into fermion pairs , and thus the typical graviton production signals at colliders become available .",
    "we now examine the phenomenology of each region in turn .",
    "we first consider region i. since the fermion couplings here are far too weak to allow for graviton production at colliders , it is natural to ask whether such states could be produced via gluon - gluon fusion at the lhc since the @xmath206 luminosity is so large at those energies .",
    "this idea runs into two immediate problems .",
    "first , in region i we know from the @xmath189 analysis and the mass relations in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the first graviton kk mass is in excess of 900 gev .",
    "this expectation drastically reduces the production rate for such a heavy state down to the level of at most tens of events for a luminosity of 100 @xmath207 .",
    "the second problem is one of signal . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the primary decay mode in region i is into a pair of higgs bosons . for more customary channels , such as dijets ,",
    "we end up paying an additional factor of 100 leaving us with no signal .",
    "we thus conclude that graviton kk states in region i are not observable at the lhc or any other planned collider .    before continuing we note that when calculating cross sections and production rates for the first kk graviton and gauge bosons we have assumed that they can decay only into sm , , zero - mode states . we have found this to be a reasonable approximation for all the cases of interest to us though other final states may occur .",
    "one example of this possibility is the decay of a first kk graviton excitation into one zero - mode gauge or fermion state together with a first excited mode of a gauge or fermion state . for fermions",
    "this is kinematically allowed only over a small range of @xmath105 but can correspondingly always occur for the asymmetric gauge final state .",
    "such partial widths have been calculated and usually lead to rather small effects due to the reduction of the graviton coupling strength at the vertex and do not result in changes to the peak cross sections by more than @xmath208 .",
    "thus their neglect provides an adequate approximation for the result presented here .",
    "next , we turn to the gauge kk states ; they are expected to be lighter than the gravitons and the lowest lying states have coupling strengths to fermions approximately @xmath209 as large as do the corresponding sm gauge bosons .",
    "however , couplings of this strength are sufficiently large as to permit significant cross sections at colliders as is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig7]a and b for the tevatron and at a linear collider , respectively . in both cases",
    "these figures show the production of a 700 gev @xmath210 state which has an unusually distorted excitation curve due to the strong interference between the @xmath211 and @xmath212 states and the sm @xmath204 and @xmath178 background exchanges .",
    "this composite excitation is quite narrow for its mass due to the small gauge couplings and is quite unlike other possible s - channel resonances such as a graviton , @xmath213 or sneutrino .",
    "the observation of the gauge kk states will thus be the only signal for the rs model in this region .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] compares the search reach for these kk gauge bosons by both the tevatron and lhc in the drell - yan channel for region i ( as well as ii and iii ) in comparison to the bound obtained from the @xmath189 analysis .",
    "here we see that there is substantial room for discovering such gauge kk states with these machines in this region .    in region ii with the shrinking of the gauge couplings",
    "there is a general degradation of the search reaches for the kk gauge bosons at both the tevatron and lhc as shown in fig .",
    "simultaneously the fermion couplings to the graviton are beginning to turn on and , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the lhc has some chance of producing @xmath2141 tev gravitons for large values of @xmath215 .",
    "once @xmath105 exceeds @xmath216 and we are in region iii we see that the lhc can discover kk gauge bosons for all values of @xmath105 less than about @xmath217 .",
    "the window for graviton discovery , due to their larger masses is somewhat slimmer and is limited to larger values of @xmath155 .",
    "when @xmath218 gravitons can no longer be observed at the lhc due to their large masses .",
    "it is clear that in region iii the kk excitations of both the graviton and gauge bosons can be _ simultaneously _ produced as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] for an  linear collider .    in region",
    "iv the precision electroweak constraints show that the first excitation of both the gauge and graviton kk towers is above the kinematic threshold for direct production at the lhc .",
    "however , their contribution to fermion pair production may still be felt via virtual exchange , similarly to contact - like interactions .",
    "these effects are dominated by the gauge kk tower exchange as the gauge kk states are lighter , level by level , and much more strongly coupled than the corresponding kk gravitons .",
    "in addition , the gauge kk tower contributes to fermion pair production via a dimension - six operator , whereas the graviton contribution is dimension - eight .",
    "the effects of the kk graviton exchange can thus be essentially neglected in comparison to the kk gauge contributions .",
    "we modify the results of refs .",

    "search reach in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] for various lepton and hadron colliders with center - of - mass energies and integrated luminosities as indicated .",
    "all fermion final states were employed in the lepton collider analyses , while only drell - yan data was included in the hadron case .",
    "we see that the lhc with 100  will give comparable bounds to those obtained from our precision electroweak analysis , while the nlc has a substantial search reach .",
    "these bounds , as well as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , demonstrate that this is a problem region for the rs model as they naturally lead to values of @xmath24 significantly in excess of 10 tev .",
    "from the discussion in the previous section it is clear that if the sm fields propagate in the rs bulk then there is only a small range of @xmath105 for which the rs model can be directly tested through the production of graviton resonances . either such states are constrained to be too massive to be produced , as can be inferred from the analysis of precision electroweak data , or they decouple from the zero - mode fermions and can not be produced at all .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath24 is allowed to be @xmath219 tev only in regions i - iii , corresponding to the range @xmath175 to @xmath220 . for larger values of the fermion bulk mass parameter , which is most of this parameter s natural range , the lower bounds on @xmath24 begin to approach 100 tev .",
    "one may argue that this is disfavored since it is so far away from the weak scale and may create additional hierarchies .",
    "thus unless one can construct a model wherein the value of @xmath105 naturally lies in the above narrow range it appears that placing the sm in the rs bulk is somewhat undesirable . for this reason , and to complete our earlier brief analysis@xcite , we now explore the phenomenology for the case where the sm field content is entirely confined to the tev - brane .",
    "we remind the reader that in the case where only gravity propagates in the bulk , the graviton kk tower couplings to all wall fields , and for all tower members @xmath221 , are simply suppressed by ; the zero - mode coupling remains planck scale suppressed . in the language developed in section 2",
    ", this corresponds to values of the coefficients , @xmath222 .",
    "in addition to both direct and indirect searches for new physics at colliders , precision measurements can also provide useful constraints on new interactions@xcite .",
    "we saw above that a detailed analysis of radiative correction effects parameterized by the quantity @xmath189 gave powerful bounds on the mass of the first graviton excitation when the sm gauge fields ( and fermions ) were in the bulk .",
    "however , in the case where the sm completely resides on the 3-brane , it is clear that the masses of the bulk graviton fields are no longer correlated to @xmath189 at tree - level , so that this analysis is no longer useful in obtaining constraints .",
    "a different approach to probing deviations in electroweak data due to new physics is through shifts in the values of the oblique parameters @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225@xcite . in the case of graviton kk towers ,",
    "it is clear that loops involving such particles will contribute to the transverse parts of the sm gauge boson self - energies , which will then reveal themselves in deviations in @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 . recently",
    "han , marfatia , and zhang@xcite have considered the graviton tower contribution to these parameters within the context of the add scenario arising from both seagull and rainbow diagrams .",
    "this analysis can be modified in a relatively straightforward fashion to the case of localized gravity by recalling ( i ) that the coupling strength of the graviton tower is inversely proportional to @xmath24 and not , and ( ii ) the masses of the rs kk states are widely separated so that the sum over them must be performed explicitly and can not be performed via integration .",
    "since gravity becomes strong for momenta greater than the scale , we must introduce an explicit cut - off , @xmath226 with @xmath227 , to render the integrals and sums finite . for practical purposes",
    "we perform all of the integrations analytically leaving only the kk tower sum to be performed numerically by making use of the relations @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",

    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "most of the excluded region arises from too large of a negative contribution to either @xmath223 or @xmath224 from graviton loops , while the small nose - like region along the vertical axis is eliminated by values of @xmath223 which are positive and too large .",
    "note that , as usual , the parameter @xmath225 does not provide a meaningful bound since it is quite small in magnitude in comparison to @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "as we can see from the figure , these constraints complement those from direct collider searches , , those at the run ii tevatron .",
    "in fact , by combining the two sets of constraints we would find that a major part of the displayed parameter space would be excluded if nothing was found by the tevatron during run ii .",
    "( of course , the true size of the model parameter space is larger than what is shown in this figure . )",
    "this region would be further reduced in area by about a factor of two if we also required both that @xmath237 tev and that the magnitude of the bulk curvature be less than the 5-d planck scale as discussed in our earlier work@xcite , which demands that @xmath238 be less than @xmath239 . as will be discussed below , combining",
    "all of these requirements one can in fact show that the allowed region actually _ closes _ at graviton masses in the range near 4 tev .",
    "this shows the strong interplay between data from precision measurements , direct collider searches , and our theoretical prejudices .",
    "we now examine the direct production of the graviton kk states at high energy colliders in the scenario where the sm fields are constrained to the tev - brane .",

    "these may have previously escaped detection at the tevatron by having an extremely narrow width .",
    "in addition it is possible that their contributions to the oblique parameters discussed above may be cancelled by the effects of other sources of new physics and hence this window should also be probed by direct collider searches .",
    "we then turn to the more likely scenario where the mass of the first graviton excitation is at least a few hundred gev , and explore its resonance production at future colliders in detail .    to fully explore this phenomenology , we first determine the branching fractions for the decay of the first graviton kk state into two - body channels .",

    "the reasons for this were two - fold : first , such masses are outside the range directly accessible to lepii and , second , the tevatron collider bounds for new resonances in either the drell - yan or dijet channel are essentially absent below @xmath241 gev .",

    "* we found that the couplings of the resulting kk states are highly dependent on the value of the bulk mass parameter .",
    "we then identified four regions with distinct phenomenologies , corresponding to different ranges of @xmath105 .",
    "* we examined the phenomenological signatures of this model in all four regions .",
    "we compared the constraints placed on the model from precision electroweak data with those obtainable from direct collider searches .",
    "we found that the kk states couple too weakly in order to yield observable signatures for @xmath278 .",
    "the precision electroweak constraints resulted in strong bounds for larger values of @xmath105 and indicate that the gauge and graviton kk states will not be kinematically accessible at the lhc for @xmath279 . in this case",
    ", the presence of the kk towers will be probed via contact interaction searches .",
    "* we also presented theoretical arguments for limiting the range of @xmath105 .",
    "we reasoned that @xmath176 to @xmath175 in order to ensure that the fermion yukawa couplings are not overly fine - tuned .",
    "in addition , we saw that @xmath105 can not grow too large or else the precision electroweak bounds translate into a value of  which is far above the weak scale , rendering the rs model irrelevant to the hierarchy problem . * combining these theoretical and experimental constraints yields a narrow range of @xmath105 , @xmath175 to @xmath280 , for which the rs model is viable and can be probed directly in colliders .",
    "we thus also investigated the phenomenology of the rs model in this second case , expanding on our previous work . in this case",
    ", gravity is the only field which propagates in the extra dimension and expands into a kk tower upon compactification .",
    "the phenomenology is now governed by only two parameters , with the fermion bulk mass obviously being absent .",
    "we examined the possibility of lighter gravitons , which may be produced at lep ii as a direct resonance or in an emission process .",
    "we computed the effects of the graviton kk states on the precision electroweak oblique parameters and found constraints on the parameter space which are complementary to those obtainable from direct collider searches .",
    "in addition , we delineated the signatures for the graviton kk spectrum at future colliders .",
    "the combined results of our analysis in the scenario where the sm fields lie on the tev - brane are presented in the parameter plane @xmath236 in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] .",
    "the constraints from present data are summarized by the bounds from drell - yan and di - jet production at the tevatron from run i and from the global fit to the oblique parameters @xmath223 and @xmath224 , as labeled in the figure . in each case",
    ", the excluded area lies to the left of the curves .",
    "the theoretical constraints are given by curvature bound @xmath281 , which yields @xmath282 , and by the prejudice that @xmath283 tev to ensure that the model resolves the hierarchy .",
    "we see that this synthesis of experimental and theoretical constraints results in a small , _ closed _ allowed region in the model parameter space . comparing this allowed region with our previous results@xcite for the search reach for graviton production via the drell - yan mechanism at the lhc",
    ", we see that the lhc will be able to cover this entire region of parameter space with 100  of integrated luminosity .",
    "hence , in the scenario where the sm fields lie on the tev - brane , the lhc will be able to definitively discover or exclude the rs model of localized gravity , if it is relevant to the hierarchy .",
    "in this appendix we will supply a robust argument against spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) by higgs bosons in the rs bulk .",
    "we assume that ssb takes place either in the bulk or on the wall so that if ssb in the bulk is untenable we are forced to consider the higgs to lie only on the sm brane .",
    "since there are no massless gauge kk modes when there are bulk gauge masses , we would now be forced to identify the sm @xmath177 and @xmath178 bosons as the lowest massive kk modes of their respective towers . on the other hand",
    "the photon and gluons , having no corresponding bulk mass terms , can be identified with the ordinary massless modes .    to proceed",
    "we first consider the sm - like part of the action involving only the gauge and higgs fields taking @xmath16 : s_sm = d^4xdy , and follow all of the usual steps of ssb associated with the sm .",
    "the only difference with the usual result will be the labelling on the 5-d couplings and the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , , @xmath284 and @xmath285 etc . in the usual basis",
    "this generates bulk mass terms associated with the @xmath178 and @xmath177 fields , but none for the photon and gluon fields due to the remaining unbroken gauge invariance .",
    "we expect that both of these generated masses are naturally of order @xmath12 and that they are also related , assuming spontaneous symmetry breaking via higgs doublets in the bulk , by the usual sm - like relationship @xmath286 with , as usual , @xmath287 , @xmath288 being the angle diagonalizing the @xmath289 mixing matrix .",
    "the 5-d coupling of the photon is then identified as @xmath290 . now",
    "although this all seems trivial and straightforward problems begin to appear when we try to match these 5-d couplings and the generated masses to those in the usual 4-d sm .",
    "let us first consider the case where the sm fermions are in the bulk . then , since the photon has no bulk mass term , it is easy to calculate the relationship between @xmath291 and @xmath292 by considering the coupling between fermionic zero - modes , which we identify as the sm fields , with the photon tower zero - mode , , the ordinary photon which has a constant wave function in the extra dimension .",
    "we obtain the familiar relation e = e_5=gs .",
    "as discussed above , the @xmath178 and @xmath177 of the sm are now identified with the lightest massive modes of their respective towers with wave functions of the form _",
    "w , z = e^n_w , z , where @xmath293 is a normalization factor , @xmath294 are constants , and _",
    "w , z=^1/2 , respectively . denoting the complete fermion zero - mode wave functions symbolically by @xmath295 the relationship between the 5-d @xmath177 coupling and that for the sm is given by dy f_^2_wi_w= g2 , where @xmath296 represents the @xmath297 integration over the various wave functions . note that we have assumed that _ all _ fermion flavors have the same value of @xmath105 .",
    "if this were not the case universality violation would be rampant . in the @xmath178 case , due to the structure of the coupling",
    ", we arrive at two necessary conditions for the correct matching ( i ) & & g_5c_5dy f_^2_zi_z = gc , + ( ii ) & & g_5c_5s_5 ^ 2dy f_^2_z s_5 ^ 2i_z = gcs^2,where @xmath298 represents the corresponding @xmath297 integration over the @xmath178 and fermion wave functions . dividing eq .",
    "( 50ii ) by ( 50i ) , we arrive at @xmath299 . substituting eq .",
    "( 49 ) into eq .",
    "( 46 ) and using this @xmath299 result we arrive at the requirement that @xmath300 , independent of @xmath105 or @xmath301 ! this is of course in general impossible so we must conclude that if fermions are in the bulk the ssb breaking by bulk higgs fields does not allow us to simultaneously recover the correct sm couplings for the photon , @xmath177 or @xmath178 .",
    "now if the fermions are on the wall it is easy to see that @xmath299 and @xmath302 are automatically consistent with all of the required coupling relations since we must evaluate the @xmath177 and @xmath178 wave functions on the sm brane via delta functions .",
    "however now a different problem arises with the @xmath177 and @xmath178 masses since we now require @xmath303 where the @xmath248 s are the lowest roots of the appropriate combination of boundary condition equations that yield the tower mass eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore we require that this condition must hold without any fine - tuning of the ratio @xmath304 . to show that this condition does not hold naturally , let us take as an example @xmath305 from which we can calculate @xmath306 ; we find that @xmath307 assuming that @xmath308 with @xmath309 as input .",
    "knowing the input values of both @xmath310 and @xmath311 , which takes a common value in the bulk and on the wall , we can fix the ratio @xmath312 .",
    "this then allows us to evaluate the quantities @xmath313 , as given by eq.(48 ) , which are the indices of the bessel functions for the @xmath178 and @xmath177 tower member wave functions in eq.(47 ) .",
    "applying the usual @xmath48-even boundary conditions on these wave functions as discussed above we can determine the mass eigenvalues for the lightest members of each of these towers that we are now identifying with the @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the ratio of these eigenvalues should return the input value of @xmath311 to us since @xmath314 .",
    "if we do not obtain the input value or we find that that the result depends on the input value of @xmath315 we can conclude that this approach is internally inconsistent . since our input and output values are significantly different , we can conclude that this possibility fails as well .",
    "thus if fermions are on the wall we may recover the correct sm couplings but the sm mass relationship between the @xmath177 and @xmath178 becomes corrupted .",
    "this implies that the higgs can not generate ssb in the bulk when the fermions are on the sm brane . combining both arguments , we thus conclude from this discussion that ssb must take place on the sm brane and that therefore the higgs fields are to be found there as well .",
    "in this appendix we present concise expressions for the most common couplings discussed in the main text in the scenario where the fermion fields reside in the bulk .",
    "the @xmath316 graviton and gauge boson kk couplings to a pair of zero - mode sm fields are given in terms of simple integrals by :        : c^aag_00n=1  2(1-j_0(x^g_n))kr_c(x_n^g)^2 |j_2(x^g_n)| , where @xmath317 is defined in eq .",
    "( 14 ) , @xmath169 , and the @xmath318 denote the appropriate bessel roots that appear in the gauge and graviton kk wavefunctions as given in section 2 .",
    "note that the coupling of two zero - mode gauge bosons to the @xmath319 kk graviton can be computed analytically . in a similar manner we find the following expressions for couplings involving only a single zero - mode sm field :        : c^aag_0n=2 ^ 1 _ dz  z^2 j_1(x^a_z)+_^a y_1(x^a_z ) |j_1(x^a_)+_^a",
    "y_1(x^a_)| j_2(x^g_n z)|j_2(x^g_n)| , where @xmath320 for @xmath321 , and @xmath322 correspond to the bessel roots for the left - handed fermion kk tower .",
    "let us now turn to the wall higgs couplings to zero - mode bulk fields starting from the action s_ffh=_5 d^4xdy|(x , y ) ( x , y ) h^0(x)(y - r_c ) , where a factor of @xmath12 has been introduced to render @xmath167 dimensionless . when the higgs gets a vev of order the planck scale , @xmath327 , we must shift the field as @xmath328 .",
    "if we substitute the fermion mode expansions and extract out the zero - mode pieces and let @xmath329 to account for the required rescaling of the higgs field kinetic term , we can identify the 4-d coupling as @xmath330 ( with @xmath331 ) using the familiar ratio @xmath332 which multiplies @xmath333 and which has important implications as discussed in the text .",
    "note that @xmath333 is now naturally of order the tev scale .",
    "one also finds that the off - diagonal mode yukawa couplings are induced from the same action .",
    "for example , the coupling of the @xmath319 and @xmath334 non - zero tower members to the higgs is found to be @xmath335 while the coupling of a zero - mode and an @xmath319 mode fermion to the higgs is given by @xmath336 .",
    "thus the fermion tower members are seen to mix with themselves with a strength that is characterized by the induced zero - mode mode mass , , the mass of the corresponding sm fermion . for all sm fermions , except perhaps for the top quark , these effects are quite small since we expect that the unmixed tower fermion masses begin in the range of hundreds of gev if not larger .",
    "a similar analysis of the @xmath177 and @xmath178 tower shows that the wall higgs field induces the correct photon , @xmath177 and @xmath178 sm masses . here",
    "we need to identify the 4-d and 5-d gauge couplings through the usual relation @xmath337 and as before make use of the rescaling @xmath338 .",
    "again one finds that mixing between the gauge fields within these individual towers with a strength characterized by the induced mass of the zero - mode as occurs in non - warped space@xcite .",
