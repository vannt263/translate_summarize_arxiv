    "the study of finite size ( fs ) effects in quantum field theories has recently been received a lot of attention . while understanding the structure of fs effects has always been an important part of the theory of quantum fields ( in particular in the numerical simulation of lattice field theories ) , this renewed interest is due to the important role fs effects are playing in the verification of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "partially motivated by similarity to the ads / cft problem , nonlinear integral equations ( nlie ) have been proposed @xcite to describe the spectrum of excited states in the 2-dimensional o@xmath2 nonlinear @xmath1-model confined to a finite , periodic box . motivated also by a problem in the ads / cft correspondence , a generalization of lscher s formulas @xcite , giving the leading large volume dependence for all excited states were proposed @xcite .",
    "this result was succsessfully applied for calculating the 4-loop @xcite and 5-loop @xcite anomalous dimension of an important operator in the ads / cft correspondence .    in this paper",
    "we propose a set of nonlinear integral equations and corresponding quantization conditions for the description of the full finite size spectrum of the o@xmath0 nls model .",
    "based on the proposal that the @xmath3 nls model can be represented as a limit of appropriately perturbed @xmath4 parafermion conformal field theories ( cft ) , the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations for the ground state of the @xmath3 nls model were proposed first coset models were given in @xcite . ] in @xcite .",
    "the equations could be formulated in a rather elegant form in terms of the incidence matrix @xmath5 of an infinite dynkin diagram of type @xmath6 depicted in figure 1 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the volume , @xmath9 denotes the tba kernel @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes convolution : @xmath12    ( 280,30)(-140,-15 ) ( -114,-7 ) ( -130,-15 )    the energy of the ground state can be expressed in terms of the solution of ( [ tba ] ) by a simple integral expression : @xmath13 it was also shown that the solutions of the ground state tba equations satisfy certain functional equations , the so - called y - system equations , which take the following form for the @xmath3 nls model : @xmath14 detailed studies of analogous problems for integrable lattice models @xcite indicated that the y - system is universal in the sense that different solutions of the same y - system describe all excited states of the model . the difference between the solutions is encoded into their analytic structure .",
    "thus the excited states can also be described by tba equations , which are similar to the ground state tba equations but are supplemented by additional source terms and quantization conditions .    for relativistic quantum field theories ( qft )",
    "this phenomenon was first observed in  @xcite , where for certain perturbed cfts it was demonstrated that excited state tba equations can be obtained by the analytic continuation of some parameters of the ground state equations .",
    "later , based on an integrable lattice regularization , universality of the y - system for all excited states was demonstrated and excited state tba equations were derived in the sine - gordon model @xcite . in this model",
    "it was also shown that the source terms for excitations can be determined by studying the large volume asymptotics of the y - functions .",
    "the above examples suggested that it is true in general also for relativistic qfts that the same y - system describes all excited states of the model and the tba equations for the ground state and excited states differ only by source terms and additional quantization conditions , which can be determined from the knowledge of the infrared ( ir ) asymptotics of the y - functions . accepting the above hypothesis 1-particle tba equations were proposed for the @xmath3 and @xmath15 nls models by an appropriate modification of the analytic properties of the vacuum y - functions @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the tba approach to sigma models is that the number of unknown functions is infinite .",
    "it is desirable to find an equivalent nonlinear integral equation ( nlie ) description of the problem , with only a few unknown functions .",
    "although such a set of nlies is equivalent to the y - system and tba , it is a very useful technical tool that makes the analysis of finite size effects more efficient . in the cases of interest",
    "a y - system is equivalent to a t - system and the latter can be solved by an auxiliary linear problem called tq - relations . as it was shown in a series of papers",
    "the tq - relations are the basic tool for the derivation of an nlie @xcite .",
    "in @xcite integrable lattice regularizations were used to derive nlies for certain qfts , while in the case of the @xmath15 nls model @xcite started directly from the tq - relations of the continuum theory .    in a series of integrable lattice models",
    "@xcite and relativistic qfts @xcite it has also been demonstrated that similarly to the tba case the nlie for the ground state and excited states differ only in source terms and quantization conditions , which can be determined from the ir analysis of the unknown functions . using this hypothesis and starting from the ground state equations @xcite 1-particle nlies",
    "were proposed for the @xmath3 and @xmath15 nls models @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we propose a set of nonlinear integral equations and quantization conditions for the full spectrum of the periodic o@xmath0 nls model . in section 3",
    "we study the large volume limit and give a detailed analysis of the spectrum of 2-particle states in this limit using the solution of the asymptotic bethe ansatz .",
    "in section 4 we discuss our numerical results , both for small volumes , where comparison to the rotator spectrum and perturbation theory , and for large volumes , where comparison with the bajnok - janik formulas , are presented .",
    "technical details are explained in appendices  a  and  b.",
    "our starting point in this paper is the hypothesis that the same y - system describes all excited states of the @xmath3 nls model .",
    "we generalize the nlie technique to describe the complete finite size spectrum of the model .",
    "the generalization is based on the equivalent formulations of the y - system ( [ y ] ) through a t - system and tq - relations . with the help of the tq - relations we can define appropriate auxiliary functions in terms of which the infinite set of tba equations",
    "can be reduced to a finite set of equations , containing only a few unknown functions .    in the large @xmath8 limit eigenstates of the model",
    "are multi - particle states satisfying the bethe - yang equations , which provide quantization conditions on the set of particle rapidities , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "this is constructed as follows .",
    "we take an @xmath18-magnon solution of the asymptotic bethe equations : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and the @xmath21s are the magnon rapidities and their number @xmath22 determines the isospin of the @xmath23-particle state through the formula @xmath24    next we construct the t - system elements for @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 in particular , @xmath28 where @xmath29 which is a polynomial of degree @xmath23 as a consequence of the bethe ansatz equations ( [ uj ] ) .",

    "we need one more equation to quantize the rapidities of the physical particles .",

    "we will assume that this relation holds exactly .    for finite @xmath8 the y - system equations ( [ ysys ] ) for @xmath62 and ( [ ysys1 ] ) are unchanged and only the @xmath63 equation",
    "is modified to @xmath64 since the only change is the inclusion of the multiplyer @xmath65 , which is very close to unity for large @xmath8 , we will assume that the finite @xmath8 solution is a smooth deformation of the bethe ansatz construction , i.e. both the functions @xmath66 and the sets @xmath49 are smooth deformations of the ones determined by the above explicit construction at large @xmath8 .",
    "( [ xset ] ) still holds , but with @xmath67 containing the modified particle rapidities @xmath68 .",

    "it can be shown @xcite that the two linearly independent solutions of ( [ diff ] ) are @xmath77 ( which is a polynomial of degree @xmath18 ) and @xmath238 , an other polynomial of degree @xmath239 .",
    "we will assume a similar polynomial behaviour of @xmath76 in the upper half plane for large @xmath204 thus we can characterize the smoothly deformed solution @xmath76 uniquely by the requirement that ( in the upper half plane ) @xmath240 asymptotically for large @xmath204 .",
    "in this appendix we derive the nlie in the special case where the functions @xmath241 and @xmath174 have only real roots in the physical strip and also the roots of @xmath76 satisfy @xmath242 the set of real @xmath241 roots will be denoted by @xmath243 .",
    "this is the union of the set of physical rapidities with the set of type i holes .",
    "this important special case covers all 2-particle states discussed in this paper ( at least for large enough volume ) and many other multi - particle states of interest .",
    "the derivation in the most general case is more complicated , but goes essentially along the same lines .",
    "we start with some definitions . to any bounded meromorphic function",
    "@xmath244 we associate the fourier transform of its logarithmic derivative along a line parallel to the real axis : @xmath245 for the complex conjugate we have : @xmath246 the function @xmath244 has roots at @xmath247 and poles at @xmath248 .",
    "we have @xmath249 in the limit @xmath250 we have @xmath251    we start from ( [ bk],[bk ] ) and ( [ bbbar],[bbbar ] ) , which we recall here for @xmath223 : @xmath252 @xmath253\\,\\left [ 1+{\\rm e}^{-\\ell{\\rm cosh}\\theta}y_1(\\theta)\\right ] , \\label{bb1 } \\\\",
