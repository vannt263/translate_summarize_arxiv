    "the first charmonium state @xmath12 , the bound system consisting of the charmed quark @xmath13 and anti - quark @xmath14 , was discovered in 1974  @xcite .",
    "nine more charmonium states , the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 were observed shortly afterwards . some of them , the so called @xmath23 states with quantum numbers @xmath24 , were found in @xmath11  annihilation .",
    "four observed @xmath23 resonances have masses above open charm threshold  . ] .",
    "other states were observed in radiative decays of the  or . during the next two decades",
    "no other charmonium states were found .",
    "meanwhile , the decay properties of the known states were carefully studied . by the beginning of the xxi century the masses and widths of @xmath25  states as well as their hadron , lepton and two - photon decays were described by theory with good accuracy .    a new charmonium era started in 2002 . during the past six years",
    "numerous charmoniumlike states were discovered . among them , only the @xmath26  @xcite , @xmath27  @xcite and @xmath28  @xcite have been identified as candidates for conventional charmonium , while a number of other states with masses above open charm threshold have serious problems with a charmonium interpretation .",
    "many states observed in @xmath4 decays remain unidentified : the @xmath0  @xcite , @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2 , @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the so called @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 states  @xcite with quantum numbers @xmath24 that are produced in @xmath11  annihilation also remains unclear .",
    "two new states , the @xmath5  @xcite and @xmath6  @xcite , were discovered in double charmonium production and have also not yet been assigned to any of the vacant charmonium levels .",
    "there are a variety of theoretical interpretations of the new states .",
    "the conservative models  @xcite suggest a reconsideration the effect of the numerous open charm thresholds on the parameters of the conventional @xmath25  states predicted within the potential models . however , most recent approaches admit the existence of exotic states in the charmoniumlike spectrum . among them",
    "are : the models suggesting multiquark states that include either molecular states ( two loosely bound charm mesons @xmath30 )  @xcite , or tetraquarks ( tightly bound four - quark states , @xmath31[\\overline{c}\\overline{q}]$ ] )  @xcite ; charmonium hybrids ( @xmath25-gluon with excited gluonic degrees of freedom )  @xcite ; hadro - charmonium ( compact charmonium states , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , `` coated '' by excited light - hadron matter )  @xcite .",
    "an indication of the existence of exotic states would be the observation of charmoniumlike states with quantum numbers forbidden for conventional charmonium or an extremely narrow width .",
    "discovery of states with non - zero charge ( e.g. @xmath35[\\overline{cd}]$ ] ) , strangeness ( e.g. @xmath36[\\overline{cs}]$ ] ) or both ( e.g. @xmath35[\\overline{cs}]$ ] ) would be also an obvious sign of the existence of multiquark states .",
    "the narrow charmoniumlike state @xmath0 produced in the exclusive decay @xmath37 was discovered by belle in 2003  @xcite with a statistical significance of @xmath38 .",
    "the mass of this state , which decays in @xmath39 , was measured to be @xmath40 in a close proximity to the @xmath41 mass threshold .",
    "the width of the @xmath0 was found to be surprisingly small : @xmath42 at the @xmath43 c.l .",
    "the existence of the @xmath0 was confirmed by cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite , who reported the observation of a @xmath39  resonance consistent with @xmath0 produced inclusively in @xmath44 collisions , and by babar  @xcite who found @xmath0 in @xmath45 decays .",
    "today the world average mass and width values of the @xmath0 are @xmath46 and @xmath47  @xcite , respectively .",
    "it was found by belle  @xcite and confirmed by cdf  @xcite that the @xmath48  invariant masses concentrate near the upper kinematic boundary that corresponds to the @xmath49 meson mass .",
    "charmonium decays to @xmath50 violate isospin and are expected to be strongly suppressed .",
    "observation of the decay @xmath51",
    "@xcite and indications of the decay @xmath52 fix @xmath53 and confirm that the decay @xmath54 proceeds via @xmath55 .",
    "spin - parity analysis of the @xmath0 state in the final state @xmath56 performed by cdf  @xcite demonstrated that only @xmath57-even assignments @xmath58 and @xmath59 , decay via @xmath60 in the both cases , describe the data .",
    "belle measurements  @xcite favor quantum numbers @xmath58 .",
    "however , the @xmath61 assignments were not examined in the belle angular analysis .",
    "neither the @xmath62 ( corresponding to @xmath58 ) nor the @xmath63 ( corresponding to @xmath64 ) are expected to have such a large branching fraction for the decay to the isospin violating @xmath50 mode . for example , the @xmath63 is expected to decay dominantly into light hadrons , while the @xmath62 should have a @xmath65 that is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that measured for the @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the mass of the @xmath0 is @xmath66 smaller than the expected @xmath62 mass .",
    "the most popular option for the @xmath0 interpretation is an s - wave @xmath67  molecular state  @xcite .",
    "this proposal is motivated by the proximity of the @xmath0 to the @xmath67  threshold : @xmath68  @xcite . in the molecular model ,",
    "the @xmath0 is naturally a @xmath58 state ; admixtures of decays to @xmath50 and @xmath69 are expected ; a small @xmath65 is also predicted .",
    "other options for the @xmath0 are tetraquark states  @xcite , hybrids  @xcite or a threshold effects  @xcite .",
    "this year babar updated the measurement of @xmath70 and reported a new decay mode , @xmath71 ,  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath0 signals seen in these two modes .",
    "the branching fraction @xmath72 is in agreement with previous measurements  @xcite , while @xmath73 is found to be unexpectedly large .",
    "this measurement is inconsistent with a pure @xmath67  molecule interpretation of @xmath0 and favors the model assuming mixing of a @xmath67  molecule with a conventional charmonium state  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the discovery of numerous charmoniumlike states discussed in this review became possible due to the excellent performance of both the kekb and pepii @xmath4-factories .",
    "a very high luminosity of @xmath11  colliders , constructed to search for @xmath74-violation in @xmath4 mesons , allowed them to be used as _ charmonium",
    "_ factories . using all possible charmonium production mechanisms at center - of - mass energy near @xmath75 , the belle and",
    "babar collaborations have made significant contributions to charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "surprisingly , the major fraction of the observed charmoniumlike states with masses above open charm threshold can not be explained as conventional charmonium .",
    "although the number of exotic theoretical interpretations of these states is growing , they can still not explain all of the existing observations .",
    "the field remains puzzling and intriguing .",
    "more efforts are needed both to improve the theoretical understanding and to perform more precise measurements of exotic states at super @xmath4-factories .",
