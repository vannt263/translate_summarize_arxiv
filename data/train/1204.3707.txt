    "the majority of atoms in highly excited states and some open - shell ( e.g. , rare - earth ) atoms even in vicinity of the ground state behave as complex , chaotic many - electron systems with very dense spectra and strong configuration mixing .",

    "statistical methods for chaotic compound states are widely used in nuclear physics ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "similar methods were developed for open - shell atomic systems @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "we used the cerium atom as a testing ground for the applications of the statistical theory , and studied properties of the hamiltonian matrix in chaotic many - body systems , statistics of the intervals between energy levels , average orbital occupation numbers as functions of the excitation energy , electromagnetic amplitudes between chaotic many - body states , enhancement of weak interaction effects in such states , and electronic and electromagnetic widths of chaotic compound resonances .",

    "we want to use the statistical theory to describe the effect of compound resonances on electron recombination with open - shell multicharged ions .",
    "electron recombination is an important process in laboratory and cosmic plasmas , as well as in ion storage rings .",

    "theory and experiment often deviate significantly .",
    "for example , strong enhancement of the recombination rate were observed for au@xmath5  @xcite , u@xmath6  @xcite and w@xmath3  @xcite at low electron energies . for such ions",
    "the observed recombination rate is orders of magnitude greater than that due to direct radiative recombination ( rr ) . in simpler systems",
    "the enhancement is due to resonant dielectronic recombination , though even for ions like fe@xmath7 and fe@xmath8 the dielectronic recombination appears to be deficient @xcite . in complex open - shell ions such as au@xmath9 and isoelectronic w@xmath3",
    "the absolute majority of the resonances correspond to many - excited - electron eigenstates which have very high density ( exponentially small level spacings ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite we used a statistical approach to show that the 200-times enhancement over rr observed in au@xmath5 @xcite is due to electron capture in these compound resonances .",
    "in this paper we use the statistical theory to calculate the recombination rates for tungsten ions w@xmath1 , @xmath225 . our results for w@xmath3 , where the measured rate at low ( @xmath10  ev ) energies is @xmath4 times higher than the radiative rate @xcite , are in good agreement with experiment . for other tungsten ions",
    "we predict similar strong enhancements of the recombination rate .",
    "a detailed derivation of the statistical theory for the recombination cross section is presented in the next section .",
    "numerical calculations based on our statistical theory are somewhat similar to those of standard dielectronic recombination . however , in the statistical theory one does not need to diagonalize potentially very large hamiltonian matrices for the excited states of the compound ion . instead , the statistical formalism contains new parameters , namely the spreading width @xmath11 and average electron orbital occupation numbers in the initial ( ground ) state of the ion .",

    "this dielectronic state plays the role of a _ doorway _",

    "the process looks as a series of electron collisions .",
    "the initial electron @xmath21 collides with an atomic electron in state @xmath17 and excites it into state @xmath19 .",
    "then one of the excited electrons interacts with another atomic electron to produce more excitations , etc . as a result",
    ", the initial electron energy is shared between many electrons , and none of them has enough energy to escape . in this way a long - lived compound resonance is formed .",

    "this temporal picture assumes that individual time steps @xmath27 can be resolved .",

    "in the recombination process the total energy of the system `` electron @xmath30 ion '' is well defined .",
