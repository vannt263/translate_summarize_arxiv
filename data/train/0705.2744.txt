    "the appearance of a light higgs boson , which might be similar to that of the standard model ( sm ) , is a specific feature of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and distinguishing the various scenarios is an important task for coming experiments at hadron colliders .",
    "higgs discovery through the main decay channel into a pair of @xmath3 quarks will be difficult  @xcite , in particular in the mass range below 140 gev which is common to both the sm and the mssm , and experimental investigations have to deal with signatures resulting from the more rare decay modes .",
    "besides inclusive single higgs production , higgs boson production in association with a high-@xmath0 hadronic jet provides a useful channel for higgs searches at hadron colliders , which allows for refined cuts increasing the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "specifically , for the sm higgs boson  @xcite , simulations considering the decay channels @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite have shown promising signal and background results for the atlas detector .    in the meantime",
    ", a lot of progress has been made towards improving the sm predictions .",
    "the fully differential distribution for higgs production at next - to - next - to - leading order qcd accuracy has become available @xcite , improved by resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms for low @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "higher - order corrections to differential cross sections for a higgs boson associated with a high-@xmath0 jet have been obtained explicitly : the next - to - leading order qcd corrections in the large top - mass limit @xcite and , recently , the corresponding resummation of soft - gluon emission effects @xcite .    for the analogous mssm processes",
    ", @xmath0-distributions have been studied in the limit of vanishing superpartner contributions at leading order  @xcite and were improved recently by soft - gluon resummation effects @xcite .",
    "this limit is usually a good approximation when the superpartners are heavy , at a mass scale around @xmath6 .",
    "the general case was treated in a previous paper , where we studied the mssm prediction for the total hadronic cross section for the production of the lightest neutral higgs boson @xmath7 in association with a high-@xmath0 jet including all superpartner loop contributions at leading order  @xcite , thus extending the mssm predictions also to the case of light supersymmetric partners of quarks and gluons .    in the present paper",
    ", we complete our study by presenting results for the distributions of pseudorapidity and transverse momentum , @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "section 2 briefly reviews the contributing parton processes , and section 3 introduces the expressions for the differential hadronic cross sections @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the presence of cuts . in section  4",
    "we present numerical results for the distributions at the lhc and the tevatron , based on mssm parameters around specific benchmark scenarios , in comparison with the sm results .",
    "at the partonic level , production of a higgs - boson @xmath7 together with a jet is described generically by @xmath12 involving partons @xmath13 with momenta @xmath14 .",
    "there are three classes of parton processes : gluon fusion @xmath15 ( figure  [ gghg ] ) , quark  gluon scattering @xmath16 ( figure  [ ughu ] ) , and quark  anti - quark annihilation @xmath17 ( figure  [ uuhg ] ) . while gluon fusion is an entirely loop - induced process , the other two classes also get contributions from tree - level @xmath18-quark initiated processes ( see figure [ bghb - born ] ) . those born - type processes",
    "are in general dominant for @xmath19 , while for large values of @xmath20 the loop - induced processes dominate .",
    "this behaviour is essentially a consequence of the yukawa - coupling of the lightest mssm higgs boson to @xmath18-quarks , which can be enhanced for low values of the @xmath21-boson mass @xmath20 .",
    "formulae for the relevant couplings occurring in this process in our notation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the virtual presence of the superpartners in the loop contributions modify in addition the overall production rates for supersymmetric higgs bosons .",

    "experimental restrictions to the detectability of the produced particles are conventionally realized by imposing specific cuts to the kinematically allowed phase space .",

    "we use feynhiggs 2.5.1 @xcite for calculating the @xmath103 prediction and allow for a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath106 .",
    "secondly , we calculate the leading order mssm prediction for the branching ratio @xmath107 @xcite and exclude parameter points if the prediction falls outside of the range @xmath108 .",
    "this range is determined by using the experimental central value @xcite and adding up the experimental @xmath109 interval ( @xmath110 ) and an estimate of the independent theoretical uncertainty ( @xmath111 ) .",

    "* small- scenario : * + in figure [ smalla ] , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the small-@xmath102 scenario and corresponding relative differences to the sm are shown .",
    "while the total hadronic cross section in this scenario is about 11% below the sm , the variation in the @xmath8 distribution is about 2% , as in the other two scenarios .",
    "opposite to the other two scenarios the @xmath0 spectrum is slightly softer than in the sm .",
    "the range of variation of @xmath10 with @xmath0 is about @xmath173 .",
    "the doubly differential cross section in figure  [ doubly - diff](c ) shows a behaviour similar to the other two scenarios . calculating the cross section ratio @xmath169 according to eqs .",

    "we show results for the @xmath134 scenario in figure  [ mh - max - smallma ] .",
    "the change with respect to the sm is dramatic . due to the enhanced cross sections of the @xmath18-quark processes , the quark - gluon scattering contribution dominates the cross section and",
    "even the contribution from @xmath175 is larger than from gluon fusion .",
    "the total hadronic cross section in the mssm is 22 times higher than in the sm ( @xmath176 ) .    out of all jets allowed by our cuts  ( [ the - cuts ] ) a larger fraction of jets",
    "is radiated into the central part of the detector .",
    "for instance , the fraction of jets produced with @xmath177 compared to all jets allowed by the cuts is 93% in the mssm versus 85% in the sm .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath0 spectrum is much softer than in the sm , yielding an enhanced rate for processes with jet transverse momenta below @xmath178 , e.g. by a factor of 10 for @xmath179 , and rates similar to the sm above @xmath178 .",
    "the typical hadronic cross section for higgs + jet in the sm expected at the tevatron for the cuts @xmath180 and @xmath153 is around @xmath181 for higgs masses around 100 , which is possibly not sufficient to be observable at the tevatron .",
    "therefore , for the tevatron only the mssm scenarios with low @xmath20 and @xmath121 not too small are of interest .",
    "those scenarios exhibit a cross section enhanced by a factor of up to 30 compared to the sm @xcite .",
    "this is due to the contribution of @xmath18-quark initiated processes which become dominant because of the strongly enhanced yukawa coupling of @xmath18-quarks to the higgs boson @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ mh - max - smallma - tev ] shows results for the same low-@xmath20 scenario as just described for the lhc in the previous paragraph . very similar to the lhc case , we see a strongly enhanced total hadronic cross section with a softer @xmath0 spectrum and a larger fraction of jets radiated into the central part of the detector than in the sm .",
    "we have calculated pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions for the mssm @xmath7 + high-@xmath0 jet production cross section at the lhc and the tevatron . for scenarios with large @xmath20 ,",
    "the loop - induced processes dominate the cross section , and superpartners can have a significant impact when they are not too heavy . for small @xmath20 , the yukawa couplings of the @xmath18-quarks are enhanced and hence the cross section is dominated by @xmath18-quark induced tree - level parton reactions .",
    "the example investigated here , the @xmath134 scenario , shows a strongly enhanced hadronic cross section compared to the sm , by a factor of more than 20 .",
    "such a scenario predicts for both lhc and tevatron a softer @xmath0 spectrum , with a fraction of jets radiated into the central part of the detector larger than in the sm .",
