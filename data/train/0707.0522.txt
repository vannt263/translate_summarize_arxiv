    "however , there is only one known oxide spinel superconductor to date , liti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( lto ) , with a superconducting phase that persists up to 13 k. johnston et al . found superconductivity in lto as the end member of a solid solution of spinel - structure li@xmath4ti@xmath5o@xmath1 ( 0@xmath6x@xmath60.33).@xcite in the li spinels half - integral charge exists on each of the octahedral ions due to the monovalent nature of tetrahedrally coordinated li . unlike the layered structure of superconducting cuprates , lto has 3d connectivity of edge - sharing tio@xmath7 octahedra with average octahedral site valence of @xmath8 ( equal amounts of ti@xmath9 and ti@xmath10 ) . oxygen deficient srtio@xmath11 and lto both superconduct and both have mixed - valent ti in octahedral coordination;@xcite however , the ti@xmath9/ti@xmath10 ratio is 1.0 in lto while there is significantly more ti@xmath10 in srtio@xmath11 .",
    "superconductivity and normal state properties of lto can be largely explained in terms of a @xmath12-band superconductor within the bardeen - cooper - schreiffer ( bcs ) model.@xcite however , the microscopic mechanisms of superconductivity are still not well understood and open questions still remain as to the role of electron - electron correlations and spin fluctuations in determining some of its properties .",
    "recent theoretical studies on the composition - driven metal - insulator transition for li(m , ti)@xmath0o@xmath1 with m = li and al @xcite postulate that electronic correlations are strong in these materials .",
    "since a quantum site percolation model that reproduces noninteracting behavior does not successfully predict the details of the metal to insulator transition , they conclude that electronic correlations are significant in the lto parent system as well as li - excess and al - doped lto .    in bulk studies of primarily polycrystalline samples ,",
    "there have been widely varying normal state and superconducting properties influenced by vacancies,@xcite li content , and ti network disorder.@xcite studies probing the effects of lattice strain on the superconductivity in bulk lto have shown the application of hydrostatic pressure to increase the debye temperature which in turn increases t@xmath13 as predicted by bcs theory , and such enhancement of t@xmath13 has been observed in both li deficient and stoichiometric lto samples.@xcite there have been comparatively fewer bulk single crystal studies with systematic characterization of physical properties .",
    "epitaxial thin films of lto are model systems for the systematic study of the role of lattice strain and microstructural disorder on superconducting properties .",
    "epitaxial lattice strain gives rise to changes in the bandwidth that affect electron - electron correlations in many epitaxial thin film systems.@xcite in addition , systematic variations in epitaxial film microstructural disorder may be obtained through the choice of substrate with lattice parameters not equal to the film lattice parameter due to changes in film growth mode or nucleation of dislocations and other defects.@xcite such variation in microstructure can shed light on the various scattering processes that may or may not affect its superconducting properties .",
    "finally , the choice of substrate orientation may provide insight into either intrinsic or strain - induced anisotropic film properties.@xcite however , to date there has been no report of epitaxial thin film growth , although polycrystalline thin films have been synthesized by inukai et al.@xcite    in this paper , we report on the successful synthesis and superconducting and normal state characterization of epitaxial lto thin films on single crystalline mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 , mgo , and srtio@xmath2 substrates . by comparing the superconducting and normal state transport properties of lto films on these three different substrates we are able to identify the role of lattice strain , ti network disorder and stoichiometry on superconductivity . for example ,",

    "these antiphase boundaries provide ti network disorder in lto films .",
    "a previous report indicated that diffusion of mg into lto could suppress the superconducting phase,@xcite and in this case the source of mg would be interdiffusion at the film - substrate interface .",

    "other spinels have been shown to grow epitaxially on perovskite - structure substrates,@xcite lto films were also grown on perovskite sto ( a = 0.3905 nm , f = -7.07 @xmath16 ) .",
    "the perovskite substrate promoted the growth of the spinel superconducting phase in spite of the high compressive strain and anti - phase boundaries due to the unit cell of lto being twice a perovskite unit cell .",
    "mao and sto substrates were chosen to perform a more extensive thickness dependence study on both ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) oriented substrates .",
    "epitaxial thin films of the normal spinel structure oxide liti@xmath0o@xmath1 were deposited via pulsed laser deposition on single crystalline ( 001 ) mgo , ( 001 ) , ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) mao , and tio@xmath0 - terminated ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) sto with thickness ranging from 5 nm to 1@xmath17 m .",

    "rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) was used to evaluate both film thickness and composition . however , quantitative analysis of low - z ions such as li and o is difficult , and as such only ti atom density and uniformity were obtained using this technique .",

    "x - ray absorption spectra for lto films of thickness 15 - 300 nm were taken at room temperature in both normal and grazing incidences ( the sample s surface normal direction was collinear with the incoming photon direction and was tilted 60 degrees from the incoming photon direction , respectively ) .",
    "reference spectra were measured on bare substrates as well as powder from the target material .",
    "spectra were obtained by measuring total electron yield , monitoring the sample drain current as a function of photon energy .",

    "the sample current was normalized to the incoming photon flux as measured using a gold mesh inserted in the beam path .",
    "the degree of linear polarization of the incoming x - ray flux was 99@xmath251@xmath16 for both beamlines .",
    "the lateral dimensions of the x - ray interaction area are much larger than the electron escape depth vertically , thus the measured signal averages over a large number of intragrain volume as well as grain boundaries .",

    "magnetization measurements were performed with dc field applied both in the plane and out of the plane of the sample . to minimize sample flux trapping when cooling through t@xmath13 ,",
    "the trapped flux in the squid magnetometer s superconducting magnet was reduced to less than 0.28 oe as calibrated by a 99.9@xmath16 pure dy@xmath0o@xmath2 sample .",

    "films on mao and sto under compressive strain exhibited elongation of the out - of - plane lattice parameter .",
    "for example , reciprocal lattice mapping of the film 444 reflection on sto(110 ) showed almost full relaxation of the film to bulk lattice parameters for film thickness greater than 100 nm , but only partial relaxation below 100 nm .",
    "careful x - ray diffraction measurements indicated that the lattice parameters of lto were elongated along the out - of - plane direction with up to 1.7@xmath16 elongation from bulk for a 22 nm thick film on ( 001)mao .",
    "this result suggests that biaxial compressive strains for ultrathin films are non - volume preserving and therefore may affect the debye temperature and in turn the t@xmath13 .",
    "films on mgo had reflections which overlay the substrate reflections to within the experimental resolution of the diffractometer , thus the films are under slight tension and show very little contraction of the out - of - plane lattice parameter .",
    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) indicated the low lattice mismatch between lto and mgo gave rise to smooth films with an rms roughness of 0.444 nm ( or approximately half of a spinel unit cell ) for a 100 nm thick film .",
    "however , rougher film morphology was seen on mao substrates , with 1.6 - 2.6 nm rms roughness for films of similar thickness .",
    "films on sto had comparable roughness to those on mao , and film grain size for both substrates at a deposition temperature of 450 @xmath19c or 600 @xmath19c was on average 100 nm . the rougher surface morphology was attributed to the larger epitaxial lattice mismatch and the accompanying full lattice relaxation . since sto and mgo have approximately half the unit cell size of lto , we expect antiphase boundaries in the lto films on sto and mgo but not on mao .",
    "given the similarities of the sto and mao samples , these antiphase boundaries appear not to affect the surface morphology .",
    "films on ( 110 ) oriented substrates had elongated grains with an aspect ratio of 2:1 favoring the [ 1@xmath260 ] in - plane axis as the fast - growth direction , as well as increased out of plane roughness compared to ( 001 ) oriented films .",
    "no measurable anisotropy or roughening compared to ( 001 ) films was measured on films grown on ( 111 ) oriented mao , though the average grain size of 30 nm was smaller than grain sizes of ( 110 ) films with comparable thickness .",
    "rbs analysis enabled us to probe the degree of interdiffusion of species at the film / substrate interface . because of the difficulty in analyzing low z ions such as li and o , we focused on analyzing the uniformity of the atomic density of ti from the lto as well as the atomic species from the respective substrates .",
    "rbs analysis confirmed the interdiffusion of mg into the lto films deposited at 600 @xmath19c from mgo substrates with an approximate ratio of mg to ti of 0.25:2 assuming a uniform film stoichiometry , but no measurable interdiffusion for films on sto or mao substrates to within the 5@xmath16 accuracy of the measurement .",

    "similarity of the aforementioned spectra to mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 mg k edge spectra@xcite implies that the interdiffused mg in lto / mgo samples substitutes primarily into tetrahedrally coordinated sites .",
    "however , as - deposited films on mao show little mg at the surface , with a peak to background of approximately 1.01:1 for the mg k edge .",
    "in order to probe the cation environment and its effect on the observation of superconductivity , surface sensitive soft x - ray absorption spectroscopy was performed at the ti l@xmath24 and o k absorption edges on films of varying thickness below 500 nm to determine the ti ion environment .",
    "spectra have been aligned to the first sharp peak at each absorpton edge : 455 ev for the ti l@xmath28 peak ( figure [ tixasfig ] ) and 530 ev for the first o k edge peak ( figure [ oxasfig ] ) . unlike heavier @xmath3 transition metals like fe with two dominant features at the l@xmath24 edge , each of the ti l@xmath2 ( 454 - 458 ev ) and l@xmath0 (",
    "460 - 465 ev ) absorption features are split into qualitatively t@xmath29 and e@xmath30-like sub - peaks .",
    "crystal field effects have a large effect on the relative intensity of each of these peaks for the case of ti@xmath10 in different environments.@xcite for the case of ti@xmath9 in compounds such as latio@xmath2 , the lower energy t@xmath29-like peaks have low intensity compared to the e@xmath30-like peaks .",
    "since bulk lto has an equal number of ti@xmath9 and ti@xmath10 in octahedral environments , one would expect a spectrum similar to mixed - valence octahedral ti such as in la@xmath31sr@xmath32tio@xmath2.@xcite comparison of the sto ti@xmath10-only spectrum in figure [ tixasfig ] ( a ) to spectra ( d)-(f ) shows that lto spectra have an increase in spectral weight at a 454 ev pre - peak feature at the expense of l@xmath28 intensity , as well as a merging of the l@xmath33 and l@xmath34 peaks .",
    "this trend is also seen in the y=0.4 and y=0.6 spectra from abbate et al s study on la@xmath31sr@xmath32tio@xmath2.@xcite    ra et al.@xcite examined powders of stoichiometric and li - excess li@xmath4ti@xmath5o@xmath1 and found qualitatively similar ti l@xmath24 lineshapes for 0@xmath6x@xmath60.33 . following their analysis , lorentzian fits were made simultaneously to the pre - edge feature at 454 ev as well as each of the l@xmath28 , l@xmath35 , l@xmath33 , and l@xmath34 peaks .",
    "the ratio of l@xmath28 to l@xmath35 peak areas was approximately 0.14 for lto on mgo and mao , and showed a trend of increasing l@xmath28 contribution for films on sto and aged samples .",
    "this suggests that the surface of aged samples as well as the those of sto have slightly more ti@xmath10 character than similar films on mgo or mao .",
    "samples on sto capped with 3 nm aupd or srruo@xmath2 deposited in - situ at 400 @xmath36c showed similar spectra to uncapped samples , suggesting that the more ti@xmath10-like spectrum is intrinsic to the surface and interface of as - deposited lto films on sto .",

    "all spectra with solid lines were taken in normal incidence , while the dotted spectra overlaying spectrum ( c ) was taken in grazing incidence . ]",
    "in contrast , the o k edge features may be divided into two regions : two low - energy peaks at 530 ev and 532.5 ev that show strong hybridization between o @xmath37 and ti @xmath3 states , and a broader region between 536 - 548 ev exhibiting mixing of ti @xmath38 and o @xmath37 states.@xcite the lower - energy peaks for the various samples resemble the spectrum from the target material due to similar ti - o hybridization with the intensity for the two peaks for the fresh samples equal in magnitude and insensitive to film thickness from 15 nm to 87 nm on sto .",
    "since these lower - energy peaks are sensitive to neighboring ti ions , one would expect similar spectra between the edge - sharing tio@xmath7 octahedra in lto and the distorted edge - sharing octahedra in ramsdellite li@xmath0ti@xmath2o@xmath18 and rutile tio@xmath0 when compared to the corner - sharing octahedra in sto .",
    "one would also expect dramatic changes between fresh and aged sample spectra , but the aged lto / mao sample ( figure [ oxasfig ] ( c ) ) showed large changes only when measured in grazing incidence .",
    "grazing incidence measurements reduce the effective x - ray penetration depth by cos(@xmath23 ) , thus a very shallow volume is probed in grazing incidence .",
    "a similar but weaker trend of suppression of the 530 ev peak when compared to the 532.5 ev peak can be seen in the aupd capped lto / sto sample ( figure [ oxasfig ] ( b ) ) as the aupd cap also serves to reduce the effective probing depth of the lto underlayer , but also protects the lto material from reaction with air .",
    "together these imply that while aging can affect the surface of lto samples dramatically , the depth of aged material is on the order of the photoelectron escape depth ( of order 5nm@xcite but is material - dependent )",
    ".    again , comparison to the spectra from ra et al .",
    "confirm that the surface material is close to target stoichiometry as - deposited and such surface material decreases in li content as the sample ages .",
    "aging for 48 hours in air affects the surface - sensitive xas lineshape , but only with aging for longer timescales do significant changes in normal and superconducting state transport properties occur .",
    "therefore the variations in transport properties for different samples described below can not be attributed to variations in ti average valence , ti site symmetry or li deficiency and hence ti network disorder .",
    "although xas spectra can show strong differences based on site symmetry for isovalent compounds such as rutile and anatase tio@xmath0,@xcite there is no clear distinction as a function of thickness for the lto films shown in figures [ tixasfig ] and [ oxasfig ] .",
    "thus the average valence and site occupation for the surface monolayers of each film should be identical , in spite of the presence of measurable superconductivity in thicker films and no resistive superconducting transition in a 15 nm film on sto .",
    "thick and relaxed films on mao , mgo and sto substrates also have similar features to the thin films on sto , indicating that the surface monolayers do not change substantially post - deposition as a function of substrate , and the xas surface measurement is insensitive to the presence of anti - phase boundary disorder .",
    "the magnetic response of lto films was measured on all substrates and found to be comparable to lto bulk single crystals , polycrystalline pellets , and powder samples .",
    "zero - field cooled samples at 1.8 k show diamagnetic shielding with low applied fields .",
    "a linear extrapolation at low applied fields for the data presented in figure [ fig1 ] yielded a typical lower critical field h@xmath39 of 46@xmath253 oe at which point the diamagnetic response deviated from linearity by 1 @xmath16 .",

    "in fact , the much larger surface to volume ratio and small grain size pointed to non - stoichiometry at the film surface and at grain boundaries .",

    "in particular , we discuss the normal state resistivity values , resistive transition temperatures and widths , the upper critical field , the ginzburg - landau coherence length - mean free path product and hall mobility as a function of substrate and film thickness .",
    "the normal - state resistivities versus temperature for nominally stoichiometric films on mao ( e.g. figure [ maoresvsht ] ) and sto deposited at 600 @xmath19c are comparable to that of polycrystalline thin film samples@xcite as well as bulk polycrystalline samples@xcite despite the presence of large compressive epitaxial strains . the film on ( 001 )",

    "in contrast , films on mgo were found to have an order of magnitude greater normal - state resistivity despite having minimal epitaxial strain and much smoother film morphology compared to films on sto or mao .",
    "the significantly larger normal state resistivity values suggest that partial mg@xmath49 interdiffusion into octahedral sublattice sites@xcite at the 600 @xmath19c deposition temperature coupled with antiphase boundary - related ti network disorder@xcite give rise to greater scattering in the normal state",
    ". a lower deposition temperature of 450 @xmath19c yielded films with higher residual resistivity , though superconducting transitions for films on mao and sto remained at approximately 10 k. interdiffusion does not play as large a role at a 450 @xmath19c deposition temperature as confirmed by an increase in the mg k xas edge intensity in films grown at 600 @xmath19c .",

    "mgo show a sharper zero field transition width of 0.3 k but with transition temperatures depressed to 6.9 - 9 k. the lower transition temperatures on mgo substrates , in contrast to those on mao and sto substrates , can result from more significant mg interdiffusion into the lto film.@xcite films on ( 110 ) or ( 111 ) oriented mao substrates show broader transition widths of up to 1.5 k which may be linked to smaller grain size in afm scans .",
    "the increased number of non - superconducting grain boundaries in such samples may dominate the resistivity measurement , or the intragrain volumes themselves may be off - stoichiometry . similar broadening of transition widths without significant degradation of the transition temperature were seen in powder pellets of lto@xcite as well as artificial yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath18 superlattices.@xcite the broadening in the aforementioned studies was not due to intrinsic properties of the superconducting regions but instead the boundary regions with the non - superconducting material . since the lto film transition temperature is not suppressed as a function of orientation for the 150 nm thick lto films in figure [ ctvshc2 ]",

    "foner and mcniff@xcite found that in spite of different starting compositions of li@xmath53ti@xmath54o@xmath1 , t@xmath13 values were uniformly 12 k for stoichiometry deviations in the range of @xmath55 .",

    "in analogy , the t@xmath13 of films on mao and sto for a given thickness is suppressed in thinner films to a value of on average 10.8@xmath250.5 k compared to 900 nm thick films with a critical temperature of 11.3 k. thinner films such as the 60 nm film on ( 001)mao or 50 nm film on ( 001)sto in figure [ ctvshc2 ] have suppressed critical temperatures in zero field , though in high field their behavior approaches those of thicker films . on the other hand , the films on mgo had a suppressed critical temperature but fit very well to the universal whh curve when the reduced field @xmath58 = @xmath50(t)/[t@xmath13(h=0)@xmath46(d@xmath50/dt)@xmath56 ] is plotted as a function of reduced critical temperature t = t@xmath13(h)/t@xmath13(h=0 ) .",
    "the increase in the reduced @xmath58 for low applied fields over that estimated from the whh model can result from increased localization due to a disordered or inhomogeneous phase @xcite in thinner lto samples , whereas the significant interdiffusion of mg in films on mgo yields a more uniform li@xmath59mg@xmath60ti@xmath0o@xmath1 phase .",

    "if one compares the films on sto from figure [ fig4 ] and their twins on ( 001 ) and ( 110)mao using the dimensionless weighting parameter @xmath69 , one may evaluate the relative contribution of the metallic and semiconducting components in the fit .",
    "elongation of the grain structure for films on ( 110)sto ( e.g. figure [ fig4 ] ) and mao allows for the measurement of differing ratios of intragrain and intergrain volumes along different crystallographic directions in the same sample .",
    "thus by using equation [ eq_twocomprho ] one may separate the intrinsic lto resistivity from contributions to the resistivity by non - intrinsic sources such as grain boundaries and other microstructural disorder . as the grains on ( 110)sto are elongated along the [ 1@xmath260 ] direction ,",
    "current confined along the [ 1@xmath260 ] direction probes a large fraction of intragrain volumes with fewer intergrain areas contributing to the resistivity . on the other hand ,",
    "when current is confined along the [ 001 ] in - plane direction for the same sample , the relative amount of intergrain resistivity contributions are increased , and accordingly the measured sheet resistivity increases as well as a decrease in resistivity with increasing temperature above 150k .",
    "this suggests that while intragrain volumes are well - connected along the [ 1@xmath260 ] direction , grain boundary resistance can have substantial influence along the [ 001 ] crystallographic direction .",
    "the similarity in shape for the ( 001)sto resistivity data along both the [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] in - plane directions point to a more isotropic contribution of grain boundary resistance on the measured sheet resistivity .    for the above samples",

    "additionally , @xmath77 for films on sto and mao confirms that there is little anisotropy in the ratio of the two resistivity channels along different crystallographic directions for ( 001 ) oriented films .",
    "finally , @xmath78 indicates that antiphase boundaries in films on sto can increase the apparent contribution from a high resistivity channel in the temperature region of 20 - 100k for thick lto films without substantially affecting the t@xmath79 .",
    "while films thicker than 100 nm on mao and sto showed similar transport and magnetization characteristics , there was a distinct thickness dependence on the transport for films thinner than 100 nm .",
    "figure [ resthicknestrend ] shows the normal state resistivities for lto films on mao and sto deposited at 450 @xmath19c with thickness ranging from 14.6 - 87 nm .",
    "the resistive superconducting transition in lto films disappears for 29 nm thick lto films on mao and 14.6 nm thick films on sto .",
    "the disappearance altogether of a superconducting transition in very thin lto films is a signature of a superconductor - insulator transition as a function of film thickness .",
    "this transition has been seen in other systems and originated from coulomb interactions or impurity scattering that localizes states.@xcite the onset of insulating behavior occurs for thicker films in the case of lto / mao samples compared to those of lto / sto , thus suggesting that the impurity scattering from interfacial defects such as misfit dislocations@xcite due to epitaxial strain between the film and the substrate in partially strained lto / mao are more effective in the suppression of superconductivity than misfit dislocations and antiphase boundaries in relaxed lto / sto samples . however , with the exception of the thinnest films , the similarity in field dependent critical temperatures ( figure [ ctvshc2 ] ) indicates that such defects do not , for the most part , impact the superconducting properties .",
    "a two component resistivity model may also be applied to lto films thinner than 100 nm with high residual resistivity . however , in lieu of the bloch - gruneisen form of the metallic resistivity component , a logarithmic resistivity is better suited to the temperature regime between 15 k and 100 k ( figure [ resthicknestrend ] , insets ) .",
    "such a logarithmic dependence on temperature signifies either weak localization of carriers or defect and impurity - induced electron scattering as seen in granular or amorphous metal films.@xcite a strong magnetoresistance is found for systems where weak localization is dominant,@xcite but a weak magnetoresistance at 5 t of less than 0.1 % points to a defect - induced scattering mechanism such as antiphase boundary scattering as the source of logarithmic temperature dependence on resistance . as this logarithmic behavior",
    "is seen clearly in films on sto deposited at 450 @xmath19c ( @xmath81 figure [ resthicknestrend](b ) @xmath8229 nm ) but a bloch - gruneisen type fit is more suitable for films of the same thickness on sto deposited at 600 @xmath19c , the higher deposition temperature seems to reduces antiphase boundary defect density such that this scattering channel is minimized .",
    "previous studies on films with antiphase boundaries have shown that high - temperature annealing results in grain growth and a reduction in antiphase boundary density.@xcite a further crossover as a function of thickness from a logarithmic dependence to exponential temperature dependence of sheet resistance and stronger localization occurs for the thinnest films ( @xmath81 figure [ resthicknestrend ] ( a ) or ( b ) @xmath8314.6 nm ) , and this normal - state resistance crossover is accompanied by a subsequent complete suppression of the superconducting transition .",
