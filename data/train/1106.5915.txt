    "our main interest is in the behavior of the process when ruin occurs , that is , when @xmath30 .",
    "crucial questions , for example , are `` how long does it take for ruin to occur ? '' and `` what do the paths look like leading up to ruin ? ''",

    "implies @xmath33 as the initial level @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , it is convenient to introduce , by elementary means , a new probability measure @xmath34 given by @xmath35 and to state our results as limit theorems conditional on @xmath30 , that is , under  @xmath34 .",
    "some further background is useful to place our results in context . the original work on the cramr ",
    "lundberg model was done under the _ cramr  lundberg condition _ @xmath36 which among other things implies @xmath11 a.s .",
    "embrechts , klppelberg and mikosch @xcite call ( [ cr ] ) the _ small claims condition_. the major results in this area include a large deviation estimate for the probability of ruin @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant which can be identified , and @xmath39 if @xmath40 in addition , the asymptotic behavior under @xmath41 of several of the variables listed above is known ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the ruin estimate ( [ ruinprob ] ) was extended to general lvy insurance risk processes satisfying ( [ cr ] ) by bertoin and doney @xcite .    a second regime under which the cramr ",
    "lundberg model has been studied is the _ subexponential _ or _ large claims case _ ( see asmussen and klppelberg  @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the claim size distribution is subexponential and , roughly speaking , ruin occurs solely due to the realization of one extremely large claim .",
    "the small and large claims models each have their various strengths and weaknesses . a third , intermediate",
    ", regime was introduced recently in the general model by klppelberg , kyprianou and maller @xcite . to motivate this model , observe that in the small claims case ( [ cr ] ) holds , while in the large claims ( subexponential ) case @xmath42 thus , to obtain a new model we must either consider processes whose distributions satisfy ( [ sube ] ) and which are not subexponential or processes which satisfy @xmath43 for some @xmath44 but for which ( [ cr ] ) fails .",
    "it is the latter alternative that we will focus on . since @xmath11 a.s .",
    ", it is easy to see that such processes must satisfy that , for some @xmath1 , @xmath45 for example , those with distribution tails of the form @xmath46 satisfy ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "a natural class of distributions which include those of the form  ( [ p ] ) is the class of convolution equivalent distributions of index @xmath47 , which we now briefly describe . as in @xcite",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the nonlattice case , with the understanding that the alternative can be handled by obvious modifications .",
    "a  distribution @xmath48 on @xmath49 with tail @xmath50 belongs to the _ class _ @xmath0 , @xmath1 , if @xmath51 for all @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "distributions in @xmath0 are called _ convolution equivalent _ with index @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath56 , the limit in ( [ s2 ] ) must be of the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is finite .",
    "much is known about the properties of such distributions . in particular ,",
    "the class is closed under tail equivalence , that is , if @xmath56 and @xmath59 is a distribution function for which @xmath60 then @xmath61 .",
    "although the exponential distribution with parameter @xmath47 is not in @xmath0 , distributions in @xmath62 are `` near to exponential ; '' for example , distributions with tails comparable to @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , are in @xmath0 .",
    "the inverse gaussian distributions , with appropriate choices of parameters , form an important class of distributions which are convolution equivalent .",
    "these in turn are a special case of the tempered stable distributions , which have been the subject of considerable recent activity .",
    "for further examples and more on convolution equivalence see @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we can take the tail of any lvy measure , assumed nonzero on some interval @xmath65 , @xmath66 , to be the tail of a distribution function on @xmath67 , after renormalization . with this convention",
    ", we say then that the measure ( or its tail ) is in @xmath68 if this is true for the distribution with the corresponding ( renormalized ) tail .",
    "the convolution equivalent model introduced in @xcite is then one in which @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the restriction of @xmath71 to @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , .",
    "the condition @xmath74 implies @xmath75 is a nonnegative supermartingale , from which it follows immediately that @xmath11 a.s .",
    "( this is also true when . )    by way of comparison with the small claims model , consider a one parameter family of cramr ",
    "lundberg models ( [ cl ] ) , in which the claim size distribution .",
    "let @xmath76 and set @xmath77 then @xmath78 if @xmath79 and @xmath80 if @xmath81 .",
    "thus the convolution equivalent models correspond to larger premium rates ( faster drift of @xmath8 to @xmath82 , lower probability of ruin ) , than under the small claims condition  ( [ cr ] ) . in general , for any convolution equivalent model , there is an associated model in which  ( [ cr ] ) holds , obtained by adding an appropriate positive drift , which corresponds to decreasing the premium rate .",
    "however , this change in premium rate leads to quite different behavior in the two models .",
    "conditional on ruin occurring , the qualitative behavior of the claims surplus process is very different in the convolution equivalent model as opposed to either the small or large claims models . in these latter two cases ,",
    "the time to ruin , @xmath83 , is of order @xmath12 as @xmath20 . in the small claims case ,",
    "under mild assumptions , there is a constant @xmath84 such that @xmath85 and @xmath86}\\biggl|\\frac{x(t{\\tau(u)})}{{\\tau(u)}}-bt\\biggr|\\to0 \\qquad\\mbox{in } { p^{(u)}}\\mbox { probability},\\ ] ] indicating that ruin occurs owing to the build up of small claims which tend to cause @xmath8 to behave as though it had positive drift ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . in the subexponential case ,",
    "the ruin time is again of order @xmath12 ( in distribution ) .",
    "however , in this case the process evolves quite normally , that is , like a sample path for which ruin does not occur , until a very large claim suddenly causes ruin .",
    "this claim is so large that the shortfall @xmath87 ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "an obvious shortcoming of the small claims model is that it does not allow for disasters , that is large jumps , which are observed in real insurance data . on the other hand ,",
    "the subexponential model is very extreme and uninformative in the sense that paths leading to ruin look quite normal until suddenly a large claim occurs , which results in ruin with an arbitrarily large shortfall .",
    "by contrast , the convolution equivalent model allows for disasters to occur , but they are not so ruinous as to be disproportionate in size relative to the reserve level . we will show that , in this model , asymptotically , ruin occurs in finite time ( in distribution ) , and for ruin to occur ,",
    "the claims surplus process must take a large jump from a neighborhood of the origin to a neighborhood of @xmath12 .",
    "this jump may result in ruin , but if not , the process @xmath88 subsequently behaves like @xmath8 conditioned to hit @xmath72 . in either case , the shortfall at ruin converges in distribution to a finite random variable as @xmath20 .",
    "these results will follow from a path decomposition and asymptotic analysis of the distribution of @xmath8 , conditional on ruin , in a way described below .",
    "the idea of studying ruin through a description of the entire path leading up to ruin , seems to have first appeared in asmussen @xcite , where the small claims case for random walk is investigated .",
    "for work in the subexponential case , see asmussen and klppelberg @xcite .",

    "the heuristic meaning of the result is that the conditioned process , for large @xmath12 , can be approximated as follows :    * run the process @xmath182 for times @xmath204 ; * then , run the process @xmath205 from time @xmath183 on , that is , at time @xmath206 the value of the process is @xmath207 .",

    "it is apparent that many asymptotic results will flow from theorem [ thml1 ] .",

    "so far this has been neglected in studies of this type ( except , see the paper of braverman @xcite discussed below ) .",
