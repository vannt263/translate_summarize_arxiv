    "strong interactions of quarks are described in the standard model ( sm ) by an @xmath5 gauge theory known as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite . as the gauge group is non - abelian ,",
    "the gluons have direct self - interactions that lead to the well - known asymptotic freedom @xcite due to a negative beta function @xmath6 , which causes the coupling constant @xmath7 decreasing at short distances or ultraviolet(uv ) region , so that perturbative qcd at the uv region works well . at low energies or infrared(ir ) region , perturbative methods are no longer applicable as the coupling constant @xmath7 grows in the ir region .",
    "we are currently unable to solve from first principle the low energy dynamics of qcd , one can then construct effective quantum field theories to describe the low energy features of qcd , such as dynamically generated spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite . it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that such a dynamically generated spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking can lead to the consistent mass spectra for both the lowest lying nonet pseudoscalar mesons and nonet scalar mesons . though the resulting mass spectra for the ground states were found to agree well with the experimental data , it is not manifest in a chiral effective field theory how to characterize the excited meson states .",
    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) duality conjectured by maldacena @xcite and further developed in @xcite has shed new light on solving the problem of strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "subsequently , this correspondence is aggressively expanded to include qcd .",
    "there are two types of ads / qcd models , one is called hard - wall ads / qcd @xcite , the other is known as a soft - wall ads / qcd @xcite . there is also another interesting way to calculate the mass spectra for light mesons and baryons by using the approach of light - front holography@xcite .",
    "the soft wall ads / qcd model has been applied to characterize the basic trend of excited states by introducing the dilaton as a special background field .",
    "the 5d action of soft wall ads / qcd model can be written as follows [ lagran1 ] s_5=d^5xe^-(z)tr with @xmath8 playing the role of a soft cut - off . where @xmath9 , @xmath10e^{2i\\pi(x , z)}$ ] , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with @xmath19=\\delta^{ab}/2 $ ] ) correspond to the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector meson fields . here",
    ", the term @xmath20 was introduced to improve the masses of scalar mesons which we have discussed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 is the solution of the minimal condition in 5d space , it has the following form for the case of three flavors @xmath22    for simplicity , su(2 ) symmetry remains to be considered as a good symmetry .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is found to be @xmath24",
    "@xcite with @xmath25 being the color number , and @xmath26 is fixed by   correspondence .    in our previous paper @xcite , we have constructed a predictive soft - wall ads / qcd model by simply modifying the background metric at the infrared region , which can result in a non - trivial dilaton solution .",
    "such a model has been shown to incorporate both the chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement , and lead to a consistent prediction for all of the resonance scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial vector mesons with agreement better than @xmath27 in comparison with the experiment data . here",
    "we shall extend such a predictive ads / cd model to include three flavor quarks .",
    "the problem and challenge of including three flavor quarks mainly come from the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking due to the difference between strange quark and up / down quark masses , which leads to the different values @xmath28 and @xmath29 in ads / qcd models . in general , by considering the effects of su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking , we shall be able to make a prediction for the mass spectra of all su(3 ) octet and singlet resonance mesons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : includes ] , we shall first apply the same dilaton solution obtained in@xcite with appropriate parameters concerning the strange quark to present an intuitive prediction for the su(3 ) octet and singlet meson mass spectra . in section [ sec : add ] , we will consider several physically meaningful higher - order interaction terms to improve the predictions for the mass spectra of mesons , which includes the @xmath30 symmetry breaking term .",
    "by appropriately solving the minimal conditions including the su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects , we arrive at a more reasonable prediction for the mass spectra of all su(3 ) octet and singlet ground - state and resonance mesons .",
    "the possible contributions from the determinant term due to the instanton effects are discussed in section [ sec : determinant ] . in section [ sec : mixing ] , we discuss possible effects from the mixing term between isosinglet and singlet mesons .",
    "our conclusions and remarks are presented in the last section .",
    "here we take the same metric as the one introduced in @xcite [ metric ] ds^2=a^2(z)(_dx^dx^-dz^2);a^2(z)=(1+_g^2z^2)/z^2 where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a constant mass scale .    as we have shown in @xcite that the background dilaton @xmath33 has an asymptotic behavior [ dilation0 ] ( z)=_d^2 z^2 where the parameter @xmath34 sets the meson mass scale , which actually relates to the mass scale @xmath32 when the @xmath21 is known .    considering the independent variations corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we arrive at the following two minimal conditions : [ xexpect ] _",
    "z(a(z)^3e^-(z)_z(z ) ) -a(z)^5e^-(z)m_x^2(z)-a^5(z)e^-(z)(z)^3=0 . + _",
    "z(a(z)^3e^-(z)_z v_s(z ) ) -a(z)^5e^-(z)m_x^2 v_s(z)-a^5(z)e^-(z ) v_s(z)^3=0 .    in the chiral limit or with exact su(3 ) symmetry , one has @xmath29=@xmath28 , then the above two equations are reduced to one , so that the dilaton solution obtained from @xmath28 in @xcite can directly be applied .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the form of @xmath35 in model iib can lead to the better mass spectra for resonance mesons in comparison with experimental data .",
    "thus , we shall take the similar form for @xmath37 and @xmath29 but with su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects : ( z)= z(m_u+z^2)(1+f_u z^4)^-5/8 , v_s(z)= z(m_s+z^2)(1+f_s z^4)^-5/8 . where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are interpreted via ads / cft duality as the up quark or down quark mass and quark condensate , respectively . similarly @xmath40 and @xmath41 correspond to the strange quark mass and its condensate .",
    "the normalization @xmath42 is fixed by qcd with @xmath43 @xcite . with the above",
    "given forms for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we have the relation for the two mass scales @xmath44 .",
    "the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined by using the well measured pion and kaon meson masses @xmath45 mev , @xmath46 mev and their decay constants @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 mev .",
    "the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fixed from minimizing the breaking of gell - mann - oakes - renner(gmor ) relations @xmath51 and @xmath52 , numerically it is at a few percent level .",
    "other parameters are fitted by optimizing the mass spectrum of all mesons .",
    "the numerical values of the input parameters with three flavor quarks are given in table i , where the parameters concerning two flavor quarks are taken to be the same as the ones given in @xcite .",
    "all the quoted experimental data for comparison are taken from the particle data group(pdg ) @xcite .",
    ".the input parameters in the present model with three falvors . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have investigated the infrared improved soft - wall ads / qcd model with three flavors , and shown that the chiral @xmath53 and @xmath54 symmetry breaking and linear confinement can well be understood within such a simple model .",
    "the resulting resonance meson states agree well with the experimentally confirmed resonances . except the quartic interaction term discussed in @xcite",
    ", two additional quartic terms have been introduced to improve the mass spectra of su(3 ) octet and singlet states , especially the ground state mesons .",
    "the special quartic term @xmath55 which breaks chiral u(1 ) symmetry has been shown to interact with the singlet pseudoscalar when adding to the action , it then results in a better agreement for the prediction of @xmath56 meson mass .",
    "we have also found that the quartic term @xmath57 can improve the prediction for the ground state mass spectra of axial - vector mesons , and bring a better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the instanton effects given by the determination term have also been discussed , though it can improve the prediction for the ground state mass spectra of scalar mesons , while its coupling coefficient can not be too large , otherwise it may cause the instability of the dilaton solution and also the breaking of the gomr relation for kaon meson .",
    "it is similar to the quartic term of meson field x , which may change the sign of the dilaton solution in the infrared region and destroy the special slope of dilaton needed to generate the linear confinement , so its coupling coefficient has to be set in an appropriate range .",
    "we would like to point out that the simple predictive ads / qcd model discussed in the present paper provides us an intuitive and also quantitative understanding on both the su(3 ) chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement , while it needs to be further improved and developed for a better understanding on the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking in order to bring a more consistent prediction on the mass spectra of all su(3 ) octet and singlet meson states .",
    "it would be interesting to further investigate possible contributions from other higher order terms . again in the present considerations , the dilaton and gravity are treated as background fields , it would be important to study the dynamical features of dilaton field and consistently consider the 5d gravity effects from the back - reacted geometry .",
