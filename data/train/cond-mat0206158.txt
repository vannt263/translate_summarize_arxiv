    "in any systems of gauge fields ( abelian or non - abelian ) coupled to matters ( fermions or bosons ) , the conventional green function is defined as : @xmath3    in momentum space , the fully - interacting fermion green function in eqn.[non ] takes the form @xmath4 . in 4 ( 3 ) dimensional space - time , it corresponds to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) where the anomalous dimension @xmath7 can be calculated by standard renormalization group ( rg ) by extracting uv divergences .",
    "unfortunately , this green function is not gauge invariant , @xmath7 depends on the fixed gauge in which the calculation is done .",
    "schwinger proposed the following gauge - invariant green function @xcite : @xmath8 where the inserted dirac string makes the schwinger green function gauge invariant .",
    "@xmath9 depends on the the integral path @xmath10 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . for simplicity reason ,",
    "we take @xmath13 to be a straight line @xcite .    in fact",
    ", the path @xmath14 should be determined by the underlying physical systems . in qed or qcd , in principle , one should perform average over all possible paths from @xmath11 to @xmath12 with some weights , but what kind of weight factors should be used is still unclear .",
    "non - smooth paths with cusps or intersections will also cause additional complications .",
    "perturbative qcd makes sense only at short distance , so choosing straight line may be reasonable .",
    "see @xcite for some preliminary discussions . in condensed matter systems such as fractional quantum hall effects or high temperature superconductors ( hts ) , formulated on a lattice ,",
    "the physical quantities such as real electron green function in fqhe or angle resolved photo - emissions spectroscopy ( arpes ) in hts are independent of path , therefore taking a straight line is not only simplest and also plausible . in @xcite",
    ", we will discuss the path dependence of gauge - invariant green functions in different condensed matter systems formulated on lattices .    in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the schwinger gauge - invariant green function",
    "is closely associated with the hadronic bound states and was studied before @xcite . in recent years , its importance in condensed matter system was recognized in the contexts of fractional quantum hall systems @xcite and high temperature superconductors @xcite .    by a singular gauge transformation which attaches two flux quanta to each electron ,",
    "an electron in an external magnetic field was mapped to a composite fermion in a reduced magnetic field @xcite .",
    "although transport properties which are directly related to two particle green functions can be directly studied in the composite fermion language , the tunneling density of states which is directly related to the single particle electron green function is much more difficult to study .",
    "in fact , the single particle electron green function is equal to the gauge - invariant green function of the composite fermion which was evaluated for non - relativistic fermions by phenomelogical arguments in ref.@xcite .",
    "most recently , the importance of gauge - invariant green function of fermion to angle resolved photo - emission ( arpes ) data in high temperature superconductors was discovered independently by rantner and wen ( rw ) @xcite and the author @xcite in different contexts . starting from @xmath15 or @xmath16 gauge theory of doped mott insulators @xcite , rw discussed the relevance of this gauge - invariant green function to arpes data .",
    "they also pointed out that in temporal gauge , the equal - space gauge - invariant green function in eqn.[inv ] is equal to that of the conventional gauge dependent one in eqn.[non ] .",
    "starting from a complementary ( or dual ) approach pioneered by balents _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the author studied how quantum @xcite or thermal @xcite fluctuations generated @xmath17 vortices can destroy @xmath18-wave superconductivity and evolve the system into underdoped regime at @xmath19 or pseudo - gap regime at finite @xmath20 . in the vortex plasma regime around the _ finite _ temperature kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite , the vortices can be treated by classical hydrodynamics . by anderson singular gauge transformation which attaches the flux from the classical vortex to the quasi - particles of @xmath18-wave superconductors @xcite , the quasi - particles ( spinons ) are found to move in a random _ static _ magnetic field generated by the classical vortex plasma @xcite .",
    "the electron spectral function @xmath21 is the product of the classical vortex correlation function and the _ gauge invariant _ green function of the spinon in the random magnetic field .",
    "techniqually , this static gauge invariant green function is different from the original dynamic schwinger gauge invariant green function .",
    "conceptually , both are single particle gauge - invariant green function and are physically measurable quantities .",
    "recently , two different methods are developed to calculate the gauge invariant green function eqn.[inv ] .",
    "the author in ref.@xcite evaluated it in a path integral representation . in ref.@xcite , by applying the methods developed to study clean @xcite and disordered @xcite fqh transitions and superconductors to insulator transitions @xcite , the author developed a very simple and effective method to study the gauge invariant green function . in the context of @xmath0 dimensional massless quantum electro - dynamics ( qed3 ) @xcite ,",
    "the author studied the gauge - dependent green function both in temporal gauge and in coulomb gauge . in temporal gauge",
    ", the infrared divergence was found to be in the middle of the contour integral along the real axis , it was regularized by deforming the contour into complex plane by physical prescription , the anomalous dimension was found and argued to be the same as that of gauge - invariant green function .",
    "however , in coulomb gauge , the infra - red divergence was found to be at the two ends of the contour integral along the real axis , therefore un - regulariable , anomalous dimension was even not defined .",
    "this infra - red divergence was shown to be canceled in any physical gauge invariant quantities such as @xmath22 function and correlation length exponent @xmath23 as observed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the author also studied the gauge - invariant green function directly by lorentz covariant calculation with different gauge - fixing parameters and find that the exponent is independent of the gauge fixing parameters and is exactly the same as that found in temporal gauge .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the simple and effective method developed in ref.@xcite to study the two interesting physical systems : @xmath24 dimensional qed and @xmath0 dimensional chern - simon theory and their corresponding @xmath2 non - abelian counter - parts .",
    "the importance of the first system is obvious in high energy physics .",
    "the second system is closely related to the high temperature behaviors of @xmath24 dimensional qed or qcd .",
    "it may also describe fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) transitions @xcite . the gauge invariant green function eqn.[inv ] is a relativistic analog of tunneling density of state in fqh system studied by phenomelogical method in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we study qed4 in both temporal gauge and lorentz covariant gauge , we also extend our results to non - abelian @xmath25 qcd . in section iii , we study qed3 with chern - simon term also in both temporal gauge and lorentz covariant gauge , we also extend our results to non - abelian @xmath25 chern - simon theory .",
    "finally , we reach conclusions by summarizing our results in three simple and intuitive rules .",
    "the standard @xmath24 dimensional massless quantum electro - dynamics ( qed4 ) lagrangian is : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a four component spinor , @xmath29 are @xmath30 species of dirac fermion , @xmath31 are @xmath32 matrices satisfying the clifford algebra @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast to qed3 studied in @xcite , the coupling constant @xmath34 is marginal ( or dimensionless ) at 4 space - time dimension .",
    "straight - forward perturbation suffices .    with the gauge fixing term @xmath35 , the gauge field propagator",
    "is : @xmath36    by extracting uv divergence , we find the anomalous exponent for the gauge dependent green function in eqn.[non ] @xmath37    note that in landau gauge @xmath38 , @xmath7 vanishes ! in usual textbooks ,",
    "the detailed calculations were given in feymann gauge @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "obviously , @xmath7 is a gauge - dependent quantity and its physical meaning in any lorentz covariant gauges is not evident . in the following section , we will calculate @xmath7 in two lorentz non - covariant gauges : temporal gauge and coulomb gauge .      as stated in the introduction , the main focus of this paper is the gauge - invariant green function eqn.[inv ] . in temporal gauge ,",
    "the equal - space gauge invariant green function is the same as the gauge dependent one @xcite .",
    "the strategy taken in ref.@xcite is to calculate the conventional green function in temporal gauge @xmath41 and then see what we can say about the gauge invariant green function .",
    "as shown in @xcite in the context of qed3 , in temporal gauge and coulomb gauge which break lorentz invariance , we run into both uv and ir divergences .",
    "a sensible and physical method was developed to regularized these plaguey ir divergences .",
    "here we take the same strategy and apply similar method to regularized these ir divergences in the context of qed4 .    with the notation @xmath42 , in @xmath43 gauge ,",
    "it is easy to find the propagator : @xmath44    the one - loop fermion self - energy feymann diagram is     the fermion self - energy diagram in temporal gauge    the corresponding expression is @xmath45    by using standard @xmath46 matrices clifford algebra and suppressing the prefactor @xmath47 , we can simplify the above equation to : @xmath48    we choose the external momentum @xmath49 to be along @xmath50 axis , then @xmath51 . setting @xmath52 , we find the logarithmic divergence : @xmath53    the integral can be rewritten as : @xmath54    as expected , we run into ir divergence at @xmath55 which is in the middle point of the contour integral on the real axis from @xmath56 to @xmath57 . fortunately , by physical prescription , we can avoid the ir singularity at @xmath55 by deforming the contour as shown in fig.2     the contour path @xmath58 to bypass the ir singularity in temporal gauge    the divergent part in eqn.[div ] becomes :    @xmath59    putting back the prefactor @xmath47 , we get the final answer : @xmath60    we can identify the anomalous dimension as @xmath61    we expect this is the correct anomalous dimension of the gauge - invariant green function eqn.[inv ] in qed4 .",
    "it is consistent with the result in @xcite achieved with very different method .    in the above calculation",
    ", we choose a cut - off @xmath62 in 4-momentum @xmath63 , just as in qed3 studied in @xcite , we can introduce an alternate cut - off @xmath64 only in 3-momentum @xmath65 , but integrate the frequency @xmath66 freely from @xmath67 to @xmath68 . using the similar infra - red regulization scheme as in fig .",
    "2 , we find exactly the same answer as eqn.[expqed ] .",
    "this agreement indeed shows that the exponent eqn.[expqed ] is universal independent of different cut - offs or different renormalization schemes .    just as in qed3 studied in @xcite , we could evaluate the green function in coulomb gauge @xmath69 . as in temporal gauge",
    ", we also run into ir divergence . in",
    "both cut - off @xmath70 and cut - off @xmath71 , we run into ir divergences at @xmath72 which are at the two end points of the contour integral on the real axis from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "unfortunately , from physical prescription , we are unable to avoid the ir singularities at the two end points @xmath73 by deforming the contour . therefore , we are unable to identify anomalous exponent . furthermore , the results are different in the two different cutoffs .",
    "this should cause no disturbance , because , in contrast to the green function in temporal gauge , the green function eqn.[non ] in coulomb gauge does not correspond to any physical quantities .",
    "all these ir divergences should disappear in any gauge - invariant physical quantities like @xmath22 function and critical exponents .",
    "the final answers for these physical quantities should also be independent of different cut - offs or different renormalization schemes .      in this subsection",
    ", we will calculate the gauge invariant green function directly in lorentz covariant gauge eqn.[qedco ] without resorting to the gauge dependent green function .",
    "we will also compare with the result achieved in temporal gauge .",
    "the inserted dirac string in eqn . [ inv ] can be written as : @xmath74 where the source current is : @xmath75 where @xmath76 parameterizes the integral path @xmath13 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",

    "fortunately , the @xmath89 independent part was already given in ref.@xcite in a different context : @xmath90 where @xmath46 is the euler constant .",
    "the linear divergence is a arti - fact of the momentum cut - off and should be ignored in lorentz invariant regularization .    we only need to evaluate the @xmath89 dependent part : @xmath91    combining the logarithmic terms in eqs.[int1 ] and [ int2 ] leads to : @xmath92    finally , we should evaluate the contribution from the third term in eqn.[three ] which can be written as : @xmath93    eqn .",

    ". instead we can construct perturbative expansion in _ real space _ by the following feymann diagrams in fig.3     the perturbative expansion series of eq.[third ]    the corresponding expression is : @xmath96    being just quadratic , there is no loops in the above feymann series .",

    "survives : @xmath103    the above equation leads to : @xmath104    in all , the final anomalous exponent is @xmath105    this is exactly the same as that calculated in the temporal gauge .",
    "as expected , the gauge fixing parameter @xmath89 drops out in the anomalous dimension @xmath7 although @xmath106 all depend on @xmath89 separately .      the calculations in the last two subsections on abelian qed can be straight - forwardly extended to non - abelian @xmath2 qcd by paying special attention to the internal group structure of @xmath2 group .    in temporal gauge ,",

    "eqn.[expqcd ] can also be derived by using the lorentz covariant calculation presented in the last subsection .",
    "the results achieved in this section is not new , but two new , simple and effective methods are developped to rederive these old results . in the next section , we will use these new methods to derive new results in gauge theories with chern - simon term .",
    "in the two component notations suitable for describing time reversal and parity breaking mass term and chern - simon term , the standard @xmath0 dimensional massless quantum electro - dynamics lagrangian with chern - simon term is : @xmath120 where @xmath29 are @xmath30 species of dirac fermion @xcite .",
