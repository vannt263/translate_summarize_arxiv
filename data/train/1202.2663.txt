    "particle - in - cell simulations are carried out in a two dimensional space , the @xmath1 plane with @xmath2 as ignorable direction , with three components for particle velocities and field components .",
    "the @xmath3 , @xmath4 coordinates correspond to the @xmath5 ( earth - sun direction in magnetotail ) , @xmath6 ( north - south direction in magnetotail ) coordinates in the geocentric solar magnetospheric ( gsm ) system .    a double current sheet with reversing magnetic field in the @xmath0 direction is initialized as : @xmath7 a uniform guide field is present along the out - of - plane @xmath2 direction and equal to @xmath8 .",
    "the initial density profile is a double harris current sheet with a superimposed background plasma with density @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reference density and @xmath12 ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the simulation box lengths in the @xmath0 and @xmath16 directions and the half - width of the double current sheet respectively .",
    "the lengths are normalized to @xmath17 , the ion inertial length , with @xmath18 the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath19 .",
    "the ratio between the ion plasma and cyclotron frequencies is @xmath20 .",
    "the ion mass @xmath21 is taken @xmath22 larger than electron mass @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the elementary charge .",
    "the plasma is initialized with a maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "the electron thermal velocity is chosen @xmath25 .",
    "ion temperature is @xmath26 .",
    "the simulation parameters are chosen to mimic the plasma characteristics in the solar wind current sheets as observed by wind and cluster spacecrafts @xcite . in order to speed - up the occurrence of magnetic reconnection , instead of using a perturbation as in previous studies ,",
    "the initial system configuration is chosen not in equilibrium .",
    "the initial current is 20% of the current necessary to support consistently the initial magnetic field configuration .",
    "as result of this non - equilibrium , the plasma is initially accelerated toward the double current sheet to establish a current consistent with the initial magnetic field configuration , accelerating the reconnection initiation .",
    "the simulation time step is @xmath27 .",
    "the grid is composed of @xmath28 cells , resulting in a grid spacing @xmath29 . in total @xmath30 computational particles",
    "are in use .",
    "periodic boundary conditions for particles and fields are applied in the @xmath0 and @xmath16 directions .",
    "simulations are carried out with the parallel implicit particle - in - cell ipic3d code @xcite .",
    "these simulations would be extremely difficult for be carried out with explicit particle - in - cell codes because of the size of the simulation box and the simulated time period . if compared with typical parameters in explicit particle - in - cell simulations , large time step , grid spacing and ion to electron mass ratio",
    "have been used .",
    "numerical stability is retained , thanks of the implicit discretization in time of the particle - in - cell governing equations @xcite .",
    "in fact , a time step @xmath31 makes the explicit particle - in - cell method unstable in these parameters regime .",
    "moreover , the grid spacing in use is approximately 277 debye lengths .",
    "the possibility of using grid spacings that are much larger than debye length still avoiding aliasing instabilities , such as the finite - grid instability , is a property of the implicit particle - in - cell .",
    "moreover , an ion to electron mass ratio equal to 256 is here used , instead of 25 and 100 in previous studies with explicit particle - in - cell codes @xcite .",
    "the effect of the implicit numerical scheme is to damp artificially the unresolved waves , such as the light and langmuir waves @xcite .",
    "the implicit particle - in - cell algorithm still correctly describes phenomena evolving on time scales that are larger than the time step .",
    "magnetic reconnection occurs over time period of tens of @xmath32 , approximately ten thousand times the simulation time step , and the implicit numerical scheme does not alter its evolution .",
    "a tearing instability rapidly occurs out of particle noise and generates several plasmoids .",
    "the reconnected flux for the single plasmoid @xmath33 is calculated as the difference of the out - of - plane component of the vector potential @xmath34 at @xmath0 and @xmath35 points along the line @xmath36 ( center of the top current sheet ) .",
    "figure   1 panel a shows a stack plot of the out - of - plane component of the vector potential @xmath34 , normalized using the background ion skin depth and the asymptotic magnetic field @xmath37 .",
    "an @xmath34 minimum identifies an @xmath0  point ( green and red colors in figure   1 panel a , while a maximum ( black color ) indicates an @xmath35 point .",
    "the plot illustrates multiple plasmoids collapse , forming larger plasmoids .",
    "the reconnection rate is used to characterize the speed at which magnetic reconnection occurs .",
    "a separate analysis of the reconnection rate at different reconnection sites is required , because magnetic reconnection develops in a large number of points . in addition , the reconnection sites move in time , it is therefore necessary to identify the reconnection site and follow them during the simulation .",
    "the reconnection rate is calculated for each reconnection site , indicated with solid lines in figure   1 panel a. the reconnection rate can be computed in two ways : ( i ) the time derivative of the reconnected flux @xmath33 ( solid lines in figure  1 panel b ) ( ii ) the reconnection electric field @xmath38 in the upstream region , normalized to the alfvn velocity @xmath39 and @xmath37 ( dashed lines in figure   1 panel b ) .",
    "the two measures of reconnection rates are in agreement in each site .",
    "the reconnection rate evolves very similarly for all the @xmath0  points : it grows very rapidly until time @xmath40 , when it reaches the 0.3 peak value , then decreases reaching the range @xmath41 for different @xmath0  points .        as result of magnetic reconnection , several high density structures are formed by the outflow plasmas of adjacent @xmath0  points ( figure   2 , time @xmath42 ) .",
    "the electron plasmoid density is approximately four times the background density . at time @xmath42 , plasmoids are large @xmath43 and progressively grow by merging and forming larger plasmoids .",
    "low density layers , called _ cavities _",
    "@xcite , form along the reconnection separatrices . during the simulation , the expulsion and formation of smaller plasmoids",
    "are not observed . because secondary islands are not produced during magnetic reconnection , the plasmoids have approximately the same spatial size and very large plasmoids , such as _ monster _",
    "plasmoids @xcite , do not appear .",
    "the hierarchical self - similar structure of the plasmoid - dominated current sheet is not detected in the particle - in - cell simulations @xcite .",
    "all the plasmoids develop a relatively strong out - of - plane core magnetic field , as shown in the @xmath44 contour plot in figure   3 .",
    "the core magnetic field is unipolar and in the same direction for the plasmoids of both current sheets .",
    "the intensity of @xmath44 magnetic field without the guide field is approximately @xmath45 , that is the value of the guide field in the proposed simulation .",
    "as noted in previous works @xcite , the core magnetic field is not uniform over the plasmoids , but it presents a complex pattern .",
    "the s - shaped @xmath44 regions , that were found in hybrid simulations of multiple @xmath0  points reconnection , are present also in the @xmath44 contour plot in figure   4 .",
    "the coalescence process drives the anti - reconnection @xcite , where magnetic reconnection inflow and outflow are reverted .",
    "the inflow is directed in the @xmath0 direction , while the outflow direction in anti - reconnection is along the @xmath16 direction ( white arrows in figure   4 ) .",
    "the signature of anti - reconnection is visible in the typical quadrupolar structure of the hall magnetic field in the white dashed squares in figure   4 .",
    "the quadrupole hall magnetic field is rotated @xmath46 with respect to the typical reconnection hall magnetic field and generates the s - shaped regions , observed previously in multiple @xmath0  points reconnection hybrid simulations @xcite .",
    "the out - of - plane current component of the current drives the coalescence process .",
    "in fact , plasmoids act as wires carrying current in the same direction attracting each other , coalescing one plasmoid into another one .",
    "the total current is supported only by the electrons : the intensity of electron current is seven times higher than the ion current , developing in the opposite direction ( figure   5 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with the three - dimensional kinetic simulations of flux ropes , where the axial current is supported only by electrons @xcite .    with     the most intense electric fields are in - plane and localized along the separatrices or in the plasmoids , as shown in figure   6 .",
    "the maximum value of the electric field is @xmath47 , that is approximately 10 times the peak reconnection rate .",
    "the electric field configuration in a plasmoid region is shown in detail in an enlargement of an area occupied by a plasmoid at time @xmath48 in figure  7 .",
    "a strong inward electric field is present in its center .",
    "along the separatrices , the electric field is normal to the separatrices ( black line in panel b ) : it is directed inward inside the separatrix , while it is outward just outside the separatrix .",
    "thus , ions in the plasmoid are accelerated inward , while electrons are accelerated outward and reflected back in the plasmoid .",
    "the ion bulk flow in a plasmoid is presented in figure   7 panel b. in guide field reconnection , the reconnection jets are not completely directed along the @xmath0 direction , but their directions are tilted by the guide field @xcite .",
    "thus , the reconnection jets from different @xmath0  points do not run head - to - head , but stream one over the other .",
    "the strong ion bulk flow is localized inside the plasmoid .",
    "an analysis of the ion phase space @xmath49 and @xmath50 vs @xmath3 in a @xmath51 thick region along @xmath52 ( blue dashed line in panel b ) shows that ions are accelerated towards the plasmoid center , and in the @xmath53 and @xmath16 directions for small and large @xmath0 values respectively .",
    "this combined motion generates a rotation of the ion bulk flow in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "outside the separatrix line , a weak ion flow rotates in the opposite direction .",
    "this ion bulk velocity system is consistent with the ion current pattern , presented in figure   5 panel b.        in magnetic reconnection studies , the bipolar electric field signatures are regarded as flag of electron micro - instabilities @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the parallel electric field @xmath54 in figure  8 reveals that there are several bipolar parallel electric field structures inside the plasmoids and along the separatrices .",
    "these signatures have maximum and minimum values @xmath55 , approximately equal to peak reconnection electric field .",
    "an enlargement of the same region presented in figure  7 shows that bipolar electric field structures are aligned along the magnetic field lines , suggesting the presence of a beam instability .",
    "the electron distribution function is analyzed to verify this hypothesis .",
    "the electron distribution functions , @xmath56 , in four different locations are presented in figure   9 panel a. the four different regions , black boxes in the central subpanel , have been chosen along the separatrix ( red line in the @xmath57 contour plot in the central subpanel ) , covering a @xmath58 wide area .",
    "a comparative analysis of the four electron distribution functions shows the presence of counter - streaming electron beams along the magnetic field . in subpanel",
    "i , the electron distribution is taken in proximity of an @xmath0  point and is approximately maxwellian . in subpanel ii",
    ", the distribution function shows an electron core population at positive @xmath49 and @xmath50 , a beam moving from left to right along the magnetic field direction ( red line in the subpanels ) .",
    "an electron beam at negative @xmath49 and @xmath50 is present also .",
    "sub - panels iii and iv confirm the presence of two beams , one at positive @xmath49 and @xmath50 and one at negative @xmath49 and @xmath50 , moving in opposite directions .",
    "figure   9 panel b shows the electron phase space along a separatrix , @xmath59 vs @xmath60 ( curvilinear coordinate along the magnetic field line vs the parallel velocity )",
    ". for high and low @xmath59 values , two electron beams are visible as two electron populations moving at opposite speeds .",
    "the interaction of two beams results in the formation of phase space electron holes , in white dashed lines in figure   9 panel b. there is clear indication that electron holes are generated by two - stream instabilities of the two electron beams along the separatrices .",
    "magnetic reconnection in a plasmoid chain has been studied by kinetic simulations .",
    "magnetic reconnection is initially triggered by the tearing instability in multiple @xmath0  points .",
    "several plasmoids originate from the outflow plasma of magnetic reconnection .",
    "the reconnection rate calculated for different points reaches a maximum in a very short period @xmath61 . after a very fast transient , the plasmoid chain dynamics",
    "is dominated by plasmoid coalescence . in this second phase ,",
    "the reconnection rate decreases rapidly reaching an asymptotic values range @xmath62 for different @xmath0  points .    several high density regions , the plasmoids develop as a result of the initial tearing instability .",
    "plasmoids grow in size by merging . at a given time , the plasmoid are approximately the same size .",
    "secondary plasmoid formation and ejection of smaller plasmoids are not observed .",
    "the self - similar plasmoid hierarchy in the plasmoid chain @xcite is not present in the reported simulation .",
    "this is in contrast with previous plasmoid chain particle - in - cell simulation results @xcite , where secondary plasmoids were indeed detected .",
    "the difference between previous particle - in - cell simulations with the here presented results , might be explained by the use of different simulation box lengths , plasma temperatures , and ion to electron mass ratios .",
    "it is important to note that collisionless particle - in - cell simulations with realistic mass ratio do not report the formation of secondary plasmoids @xcite .",
    "further studies are necessary to identify which simulation parameters determine the occurrence of secondary plasmoids in particle - in - cell simulations .",
    "an out - of - plane core magnetic field develops in correspondence of the plasmoids .",
    "the strong core magnetic field has been observed several times in satellite observations .",
    "isse 3 and geotail missions reported the presence of cross - tail magnetic field in the earth s",
    "magnetotail @xcite . moreover , mhd @xcite and hybrid simulations @xcite confirmed the formation of a plasmoid core field and proposed a formation mechanisms in terms of hall - generated currents .",
    "moreover , hybrid simulations @xcite revealed that the core magnetic field has a complex structure originating from the complex flow pattern in the plasmoid . in multiple",
    "@xmath0  points reconnection hybrid simulation , s - shaped @xmath44 regions were found .",
    "the fully kinetic simulation in this paper confirms the formation of unipolar core magnetic field and complex @xmath44 pattern .",
    "some of these structures , such as s - shaped regions , can be explained as a result of the hall magnetic field in anti - reconnection .",

    "outside ) the plasmoid .",
    "intense normal electric fields have been observed in magnetotail and an ion acceleration mechanism due by repetitive ion reflections between the separatrices have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the kinetic simulations in this paper shows an electric field configuration , that can support such acceleration mechanism @xcite and is agreement with the results of particle - in - cell studies @xcite .",
    "the kinetic study of plasmoid chain reveals that the separatrices are regions populated by counter - streaming electron beams , eventually driving the two - stream instability .",
    "an analysis of the electron distribution functions and phase space along the separatrix shows the presence of electron beams along the separatrices and the formation of electron phase space holes .",
    "bipolar electric field structures were previously observed in @xcite . in this study , it is proven that bipolar electric field structures are associated with electron phase space holes , produced by the two - stream instability of electron beams along the separatrices .",
    "the two - stream instability could generate the electron holes observed in plasmoid embedded in the magnetotail current sheet @xcite .",
    "the general properties of magnetic reconnection in a plasmoid chain in the kinetic framework have been studied by analyzing two dimensional particle - in - cell simulation results . a plasmoid chain is rapidly formed by the tearing instability and plasmoids coalescence progressively in larger plasmoids .",
    "secondary islands are not formed and plasmoids are approximately the same size with no hierarchical self - similar structure .",
    "this is probably a result of the chosen simulation parameters .",
