    "the underlying cause of the glass transition is far from clear , although there are a variety of theories @xcite .",
    "one recent method of understanding the glass transition has been to simulate the glass transition in a variety of dimensions ( including 4 dimensions or higher ) @xcite . indeed , the glass transition is often thought to be similar in 2d and 3d  @xcite and in simple simulation cases such as hard particles , one might expect that dimensionality plays no role . as a counterargument , two - dimensional and three - dimensional fluid mechanics are qualitatively quite different @xcite . likewise , melting is also known to be qualitatively different in 2d and 3d  @xcite .",
    "recent simulations give evidence that the glass transition is also quite different in 2d and 3d @xcite .",
    "in particular , flenner and szamel  @xcite simulated several different glass - forming systems in 2d and 3d , and found that the dynamics of these systems were fundamentally different in 2d and 3d .",
    "they examined translational particle motion ( motion relative to a particle s initial position ) and bond - orientational motion ( topological changes of neighboring particles ) .",
    "they found that in 2d these two types of motion became decoupled near the glass transition . in these cases",
    ", particles could move appreciable distances but did so with their neighbors , so that their local structure changed slowly . in 3d , this was not the case ; translational and bond - orientational motions were coupled .",
    "they additionally observed that the transient localization of particles well known in 3d was absent in the 2d data . to quote flenner and szamel , ``",
    "these results strongly suggest that the glass transition in two dimensions is different than in three dimensions . ''    in this work , we use colloidal experiments to test dimension dependent dynamics approaching the glass transition .",
    "colloidal samples at high concentration have been established as model glass formers @xcite .",

    "recently noted that these arguments should apply to disordered systems as well @xcite .",
    "one can measure particle motion relative to the neighbors of that particle to remove the influence of these long wavelength fluctuations @xcite . using this method",
    "we observe that the translational and structural relaxations are similar between 2d and 3d , demonstrating that the underlying glass transitions are unaffected by the mermin - wagner fluctuations .",
    "we analyze three different types of colloidal samples , all using bidisperse mixtures to avoid crystallization .",
    "the first sample type is a quasi-2d sample with hard particles ( short range , purely repulsive interactions ) which we term ` 2dh . '",
    "the 2dh sample is made by allowing silica particles to sediment to a monolayer on a cover slip  @xcite .",

    "flenner and szamel found that in 2d particles move large distances without significantly changing local structure  @xcite .",
    "they noted that time scales for translational motion and time scales for changes in local structure were coupled in 3d , but not in 2d .",
    "the standard way to define these time scales is through autocorrelation functions .",

    "the decoupling is most strongly seen for the most concentrated samples ( green curves ) , for which @xmath31 decays on experimental time scales but where @xmath32 decays little on the same time scales .",
    "the slower decay of bond - orientational correlations relative to translational correlations for our 2d data is in good qualitative agreement with flenner and szamel s observations @xcite . upon approaching the glass transition in 2d ,",
    "particles are constrained to move with their neighbors such that @xmath8 decays less than might be expected on time scales where @xmath23 has decayed significantly . in 3d , however , on approaching the glass transition particles move in a less correlated fashion .",
    "to quantify the correlated motion of neighboring particles we compute a two - particle correlation function @xcite .",
    "this function correlates the vector displacements of pairs of nearest neighbor particles ( see methods ) .",
    "[ fig : cor ] shows these correlations : 1 corresponds to complete correlation , and 0 is completely uncorrelated . for both 2d samples ( solid symbols ) the correlations increase for larger @xmath33 , as indicated by the fit lines",
    "this increased correlation reflects particles moving in parallel directions with their nearest neighbors . for the 3d data ( open squares in fig .",

    "@xmath35 is determined from the large - large peak position in the pair correlation function @xmath36 at the highest concentrations , and has values @xmath37 and 3.10 @xmath38 m for 2dh , 2ds , and 3d respectively .",
    "( the location of the @xmath36 peak depends slightly on @xmath0 for 2dh and 3d experiments , and more strongly on @xmath5 for the 2ds experiments ; for consistency , we keep @xmath35 fixed to these specific values . )",

    "[ fig : visual ] shows displacement vectors for particles in the three samples near their glass transitions . for both 2dh and 2ds samples , there are clusters of particles moving in similar directions as seen by adjacent displacement arrows pointing in a similar direction .",
    "this clustering is less pronounced in 3d , consistent with the small correlations between nearest neighbor motions in 3d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cor ] ) .",
    "as suggested in the introduction , it is plausible that some of the significant translational motion in the 2d samples is due to mermin - wagner fluctuations which act at long wavelengths @xcite . to disentangle the potential influences of long wavelength fluctuations from relative motions , we subtract collective motions by measuring `` cage relative '' particle motions @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to measure displacements relative to the average displacements of each particle s nearest neighbors , that is , relative to the cage of neighbors surrounding each particle .",
    "previous work has shown that using cage - relative coordinates reveals the dynamical signatures of phase transitions for systems of monodisperse colloids  @xcite .",

    "the black curves are the lowest concentrations , which all have @xmath51 .",
    "this is because at lower concentrations , particles can translate a significant amount without losing neighbors . however at larger concentrations , @xmath52 in all 3 types of samples .",
    "for all three experiments , the two correlation functions look fairly similar at the three highest concentrations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bond_isfcompare]@xmath50 . in particular ,",
    "the differences between the 2d and 3d data are much reduced as compared with the original analysis shown in panels @xmath17 .",

    "[ fig : bond_isfcompare ] , which are the samples closest to the glass transition . in each case , the correlation functions do not fully decay within our experimental observation time .",

    "we turn now to the question of transient localization , which flenner and szamel found to be present in 3d but not 2d .",
    "the trajectories of 3d particles showed localized motions separated by abrupt jumps , while trajectories of 2d particles did not have these two distinct types of motion @xcite . in their data , this caused a plateau in the 3d msd , which was not seen in the 2d msd .",
    "the plateau is due to particles being transiently trapped in cages formed by their neighbors , with the plateau height set by the cage size @xcite .    motivated by the considerations above",
    ", we investigate the cage - relative mean square displacements ( cr - msd ) @xcite .",
    "in analogy with the cage - relative scattering function , we use the cage - relative displacement @xmath58 to define the cr - msd .",
    "[ fig : msd ] shows the original msd data ( thin lines ) and cr - msd ( lines with circles ) . for all experiments as the concentration increases the msd drops , reflecting the slowing dynamics on approaching the glass transition . in some cases , the cr - msd is larger than the msd ( for example , all the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd]@xmath8 ) . in these situations ,",
    "the motion of each particle is less correlated with the motion of its neighbors , so the cage - relative analysis effectively adds a random vector to each particle s displacement , thus increasing the msd on average . however , for the 2d samples as they approach the glass transition , the opposite occurs . especially for the green curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd]@xmath26 , the data closest to the glass transition , it is clear that the cage - relative analysis dramatically decreases the cr - msd data relative to the original msd .",
    "while we show data close to the glass transition , none of our data are from glasses .",
    "there have been a number of experiments on other 2d colloidal systems such as soft particles  @xcite and attractive particles  @xcite which observed a slowly rising msd for glasses .",
    "our results suggest that the msd rise seen in these prior experiments may also disappear with cage - relative analysis , strengthening the argument that these prior experiments studied truly glassy samples .    to quantify transient localization , we measure the instantaneous logarithmic msd slope @xmath59 from @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 corresponds to normal diffusion .",
    "we quantify the amount of localization by the minimum value of this slope , @xmath62 ; this is the logarithmic slope at the inflection point of the msd or cr - msd .",
    "[ fig : gamma]@xmath29 shows the cr data for the 2d samples ( filled symbols ) and 3d ( open squares ) as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "while the 3d data reach lower values , the overall trend is similar between 2d and 3d : the closer to the glass transition , the more pronounced transient localization is .",
    "note that in the work of flenner and szamel , they tested both newtonian dynamics and brownian dynamics ; the latter is more appropriate for colloids . with brownian dynamics in 2d",
    ", they found slightly more pronounced msd plateaus .",
    "it is possible that the presence of brownian dynamics in our experiments also contributes to our observed similarities in transient localization between 2d and 3d .",

    "we plot the change in @xmath62 upon using the cage - relative analysis , and it is generally negative .",

    ", we observe that particles move in parallel with their neighbors , such that their local structure changes less than if the motions were uncorrelated . while it is clear from prior work that in 3d particle motions have some correlation with their neighbors @xcite , in our data the correlations are more significant for the 2d samples .",
    "these are likely related to mermin - wagner fluctuations / the peierls instability in 2d @xcite .",
    "our 2d samples are , of course , quasi-2d . both are influenced by nearby large 3d regions of fluid .",
    "the 2dh sample also has hydrodynamic interactions between particles and the nearby bottom of the sample chamber .",
    "we find that 2ds samples are more affected by long - wavelength fluctuations than 2dh , which could be due to the difference in interactions @xcite .",
    "it is certainly plausible that softer interactions allow for more fluctuations in the nearest - neighbor distance , whereas for dense samples with hard interactions , fluctuations are by necessity smaller ( as particles can not move too close together before they repel ) @xcite .",
    "recent simulation work has shown differences in correlation lengths for disks with soft and hard interaction potentials during 2d melting  @xcite",
    ". nonetheless , the agreement between the two 2d data sets is striking , especially given the different particle interaction potentials .",
    "namely as distinct from the 3d samples , both 2d samples show large mermin - wagner fluctuations .",
    "another important experimental factor is the system size : approximately @xmath63 for both 2d systems and @xmath64 for the 3d system .",
    "it is likely that for even larger 2d systems , the mermin - wagner fluctuations would be more pronounced @xcite .",
    "klix , maret , and keim @xcite recently argued that mermin - wagner fluctuations should be present in glassy systems .",
    "probably the most interesting aspect of our study is the suggestion that indeed 2d mermin - wagner fluctuations are present in our amorphous samples .",
    "mermin - wagner fluctuations conventionally result from elasticity associated with the development of an order parameter .",
    "the origin of elasticity in glassy systems is less well understood .",
    "while we have not proven that our observed long - wavelength fluctuations are indeed mermin - wagner fluctuations , one could vary the system size in future investigations to examine how the difference between conventional and cage - relative measurements depends on system size . in conclusion , with our efforts and other recent work , there is a compelling collection of evidence that 2d and 3d glass transitions are fundamentally the same : there is strong qualitative agreement between our observations studying three colloidal systems , the colloidal experiments and simulations of illing _",
    "@xcite , and the soft particle simulations of shiba _ et al .",
    "the similarities between the conclusions , despite the differences in methods and dynamics , suggest the results are independent of the details .",

    "<S> phase transitions significantly differ between two - dimensional and three - dimensional systems , but the influence of dimensionality on the glass transition is unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> we use microscopy to study colloidal systems as they approach their glass transitions at high concentrations , and find differences between 2d and 3d . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in 2d particles can undergo large displacements without changing their position relative to their neighbors , in contrast with 3d . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to mermin - wagner long - wavelength fluctuations that influence phase transitions in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> however , when measuring particle motion only relative to their neighbors , 2d and 3d have similar behavior as the glass transition is approached , showing that the long wavelength fluctuations do not cause a fundamental distinction between 2d and 3d glass transitions . </S>"
