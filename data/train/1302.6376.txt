    "in a variety of physical contexts , the situation arises that two or more propagating channels with different transport properties are coupled together , competing with each other or modifying each other s properties . under these circumstances it is interesting to study the resulting localization properties on the coupled system .",
    "such a question arises in particular in the context of exciton - polaritons , which are hybrid particles : half photons , half excitons , the two channels being coupled linearly via dipolar interaction .",
    "@xcite another realization of this physical situation can be found in bilayer graphene , with different degrees of disorder affecting the two layers .",
    "a recent work proposed such bi- or trilayers as field effect transistors , whereby a gate potential controls the degree of disorder sensed by the electrons in the bilayer .",
    "@xcite    similar questions arise in the problem of energy or matter localization in few- or even many - body problems , where a multitude of propagation channels may exist to transport particles or energy from one place in the system to another . for example , energy may be transported in small , nearly independent units in the form of quasiparticles , or it may have a propagation channel in which a larger amount of energy is propagating in the form of blobs of several quasiparticle - like excitations that form sorts of bound states .",
    "such  bound states \" were argued to be favorable transport channels in the context of few - particle problems .",
    "the problem was especially studied in low dimensions ,  @xcite where under certain circumstances such compounds are found to have an enhanced localization length as compared to single - particle excitations .",
    "the question arises , then , as to which channel of propagation is the most favorable in transport problems containing a larger number of particles , or in the situation of particles at finite density .    in this type of problem ,",
    "the various propagation channels are not independent , but couple to each other by scattering events .",
    "understanding transport in such interacting systems is a challenging and largely unresolved problem .",
    "here we do not aim at resolving all aspects of the many - body problem , but address one sub - question which arises in its context .",
    "indeed , the interacting systems have a common feature with noninteracting hybrid particles : two or more propagating channels with parametrically different localization properties are coupled together and influence each other s transport characteristics . under these circumstances it is interesting to study what are the resulting localization properties in the coupled system . in particular in the specific case where",
    "a less localized system is coupled to a more localized one , the question arises as to which of the two components eventually dominates the transport : does one obtain an insulating or conducting system ?",
    "a central result of our work is to show that the answer to this question depends crucially on the dimensionality of the system .    in our recent work  @xcite the question of the competition between alternative propagation channels",
    "was raised in disordered one - dimensional systems .",
    "this case can be studied in great detail in the form of a single - particle problem with two parallel , coupled channels . among others , this naturally describes the anderson localization of exciton - polaritons in quasi - one - dimensional semiconductor heterostructures . by exactly solving the anderson model on a two - leg ladder ( @xmath0 )",
    ", we found two regimes whose localization properties are qualitatively different : ( i ) a resonant regime , where the  slow \" chain ( the more disordered one ) dominates the localization length of the ladder ; this can be understood as a manifestation of the fact that in one dimension the backscattering rate determines the localization properties of a coupled system , since in general the localization length is of the order of the mean free path ; ( ii ) an off - resonant regime , where the  faster \" chain helps to delocalize the slow chain , although with low efficiency .    in that 1d study",
    "the disorder was taken to set the smallest energy scale , which allows for a fully analytic solution of the problem . in higher dimensions ( @xmath2 ) , however , weak disorder has no significant effect on localization .",
    "hence , we are restricted to considering intermediate or strong disorder in order to address meaningfully the question of the role of interchannel coupling . meanwhile , since the disorder is comparable to or stronger than the hopping strengths , resonance conditions , as in regime ( i ) of the weakly disordered 1d chains , are impossible .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the physics in one dimension , proliferation of backscattering plays a subdominant role for the anderson transition of the coupled system , and therefore , the resulting phenomenology of coupled - channel problems turns out to be rather different .",
    "in this paper we study two coupled bethe lattices with different transport characteristics .",
    "this can be viewed as the limit of infinite dimensions ( @xmath3 ) of the problem of coupled channels , which we will contrast with the case of two coupled chains ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the behavior on the bethe lattice is suggestive of the physics to be expected in high - dimensional systems .",
    "indeed , we believe that the qualitative behavior of coupled lattices in @xmath1 is very similar to the phenomenology found on the bethe lattice . however , the latter has the significant advantage of being exactly solvable , which we exploit below .",

    "and , where the existence of the localization transition was proven and the location of the mobility edge was found .",
    "that work showed in particular that localization is possible in the _ absence _ of loops in the lattice .",
    "the model was solved by studying the self - consistency equation for the on - site self - energy , which leads to a nonlinear integral equation for the probability distribution function of that quantity . the transition from the localized phase to the delocalized phase",
    "is characterized by the instability of the fixed point distribution of real self - energies with respect to a perturbation with infinitesimal imaginary parts of the self - energies .",
    "physically , the latter describes an infinitesimally weak coupling to a dissipative bath which allows for decay processes .",
    "the above instability signals that local excitations start coupling to a bath on sites infinitely far away , which signals their spatial delocalization .",

    "the recent work ref .   points out that the anderson model on the bethe lattice may have a further transition within the delocalized phase and corresponds to a transition in the level statistics . here , we focus however on the standard delocalization transition , as discussed by abou - chacra    in the present work we generalize the approach by abou - chacra to the case of two coupled bethe lattices . following refs .",
    "and we derive a recursion relation for the local green s functions ( encoded in a @xmath12 matrix in layer space ) and study the effect of interlayer coupling on the location of the transition .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the band center ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the case of lattices with identical hopping , but different disorder strengths .",
    "this choice is motivated by the one - dimensional case , where equal hoppings lead to resonance effects , which enhance the localization tendency in the coupled system .",
    "in contrast , we find that despite the choice of equal hoppings such a localizing effect almost never occurs on coupled bethe lattices .",
    "this is illustrated by the schematic phase diagrams of fig .",
    "[ bethe - ph - diag ] , which anticipate and summarize the main results of our analysis : under most circumstances the coupling between two layers _ enhances delocalization_. only when one couples a barely metallic layer to a strongly disordered second layer and excludes next - nearest - neighbor interlayer couplings [ @xmath5 in the hamiltonian ( [ full - ham - bethe ] ) below ] , the coupling can induce localization .",
    "however , in the largest part of the phase diagram the coupling has a delocalizing effect . in the case of next - nearest - neighbor interlayer couplings ( i.e. , nearest - neighbor coupling across layers , @xmath11 ) ,",
    "the coupled layers are always delocalized if one of the uncoupled layers is delocalized .",
    "moreover , in some range of parameters a coupling between two localized lattices can induce delocalization .",
    "our central result may be summarized by the statement that on bethe lattices the delocalized lattice essentially dominates the physics . in other words , if a delocalized channel exists , delocalization , diffusion , and the ability of entropy production will persist even upon coupling to more localized channels . as mentioned before this is quite opposite to the phenomenology in 1d where most often the more disordered chain dominates the localization properties .",

    "however , the latter is not the case if we allow for next - nearest - neighbor interlayer hopping .",
    "indeed , this introduces a weak but nonnegligible additional propagation channel , which proceeds via the disordered lattice . as the study below will show ( and as anticipated in fig .",
    "[ bethe - ph - diag ] ) , in the case @xmath11 , the renormalization of the hopping @xmath21 always dominates over the enhancement of effective disorder , and hence , the coupling always has a delocalizing tendency . in the context of the more general problems of coupled parallel propagation channels in many - body systems , the case of @xmath24 appears to be a rather generic and natural choice .",

    "the amplitude @xmath133 is the lowest order term in an expansion in the hopping .",
    "it corresponds to anderson s `` upper limit '' approximation , which neglects self - energy effects from sites lateral to the considered paths , as well as the regularization of resonances due to higher order corrections from hoppings along the path .",

    "a naive linear interpolation between @xmath165 and @xmath166 allows us to obtain a rough estimate _ c0.37 for the bethe lattices of connectivity @xmath13 considered here .",
    "we have studied the anderson localization problem on two coupled bethe lattices , which represents a two - channel problem in the limit of infinite dimensions .",
    "our main result is the finding that a conducting transport channel is hardly ever localized by the coupling to more disordered channels .",
    "rather , transport is usually enhanced by such a coupling .",
    "this holds true except in the case where three conditions are met simultaneously : ( i ) the conducting channel is very close to criticality ; ( ii ) it is coupled to a strongly localized channel ; ( iii ) next - nearest - neighbor interlayer couplings are strongly suppressed or absent . only in these exceptional cases the coupling to localized channels may induce a localized phase in an otherwise conducting channel .",
    "the coupling between moderately localized channels may instead induce delocalization .",
    "we believe that these trends persist also in high but finite dimensions ( @xmath1 ) where the metal - insulator transition takes places at strong disorder .",
    "this conjecture is based on the observation that in higher dimensions , as well as on the bethe lattice , delocalization is mostly driven by a sufficiently strong forward scattering , whereas weak localization effects and enhanced backscattering play a much less important role than in @xmath167 .",
    "we believe that this difference is at the root of the very different phenomenology between coupled bethe lattices and 1d chains .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the localization length becomes parametrically larger than the mean - free path at weak disorder .",
    "however , since the proliferation of weak localization and backscattering leads to complete localization ( in the absence of special symmetries ) , we expect that a well propagating channel becomes more strongly localized upon resonant coupling to a more disordered channel , similarly as in one dimension",
    ". it might be interesting to investigate this numerically .",
    "apart from its theoretical interest , the physics of coupled , unequally disordered 2d lattices might also have practical applications .",
    "for example , it was recently proposed  @xcite that a sheet of bilayer graphene with different disorder strength on the two layers could be operated as a field effect transistor , whereby a perpendicular gate bias tunes the effective disorder of carriers .",
    "the study of localization properties of few- or many - particle systems is more subtle than the toy problem which it motivated here in part .",
    "the reason is that multiple ( much more than two ) coupled channels with complicated substructures may exist to transport particles or energy . in particular , for few - particle problems , it has been shown that some of the channels , in which a large number of quasiparticle - like excitations are propagating in the form of `` bound states , '' can be more efficient for transport than others , in which the excitations propagate essentially as independent units .",
    "@xcite this suggests that one might have to think of the many - body problem as having a hierarchy of channels with parametrically different transport properties .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the effective dimensionality of such channels should be the same as that of the system .",
    "our analysis of a two - channel model in 1d has demonstrated that a `` bad '' channel dominates only when it is resonantly coupled to a better ( `` faster '' ) channel . if the two channels are far from resonance , or if they live in higher effective dimensionality , the fast channel almost always dominates the localization properties , as the present study suggests .",
    "moreover , even in 1d resonance conditions are not met very easily .",
    "it either requires two channels with equal hopping strength , or an energy close to the band center or the band edges .",
    "summarizing these considerations , we come to the qualitative conclusion that , apart from some exceptional cases , better conducting channels generically dominate the delocalization : a diffusing channel is difficult to shut down by coupling to dirtier channels .    in the context of interacting many - particle systems",
    "the above leads to the following conjecture : in order to establish that a many - particle system conducts and is not fully localized , a sufficient condition will be found by identifying the best transport channel and showing that it is delocalized .",
    "indeed , our study suggests that the inclusion of coupling to other channels usually only enhances transport .",
    "this observation should be a central ingredient when generalizing the ideas of refs .   and to the analysis of quantum dynamics and transport of systems with several particles .",
    "however , at this stage , the application to many - particle systems remains a conjecture which needs to be tested further .",
    "for example , one should establish whether coupling to a much larger number of slow channels does not alter our qualitative findings of  the survival of the fastest \" .",
