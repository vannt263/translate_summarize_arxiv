    "string breaking is an important dynamical mechanism in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . a quark and an anti - quark separated by a distance @xmath171",
    "are connected by a string of color electric flux .",
    "the string costs energy in proportion to its length , and thus leads to a linearly rising quark - anti - quark potential @xmath172 , where @xmath77 is the string tension . when the quark mass is taken to infinity , i.e.  when one considers an @xmath173 yang - mills theory of pure gluons , in which quarks and anti - quarks appear just as external sources of color flux , the confining string is unbreakable . in qcd with dynamical quarks , however , the string can break by quark - anti - quark pair creation , as soon as the energy of the string is larger than the mass of the mesons generated in the pair creation process .",
    "the dynamics of string breaking , i.e.  its evolution in real time , is inaccessible to classical simulations using lattice gauge theory , which is usually formulated in euclidean time . as for other quantum systems with a large number of degrees of freedom , studying the real - time evolution of a lattice gauge theory leads to a very severe sign problem .",
    "for this reason , understanding the real - time dynamics of gauge theories from first principles remains inaccessible to the traditional methods of theoretical physics .",
    "quantum simulators are a very promising tool for overcoming this problem .",
    "string breaking is only one example of a dynamical mechanism whose real - time evolution is interesting but very difficult to investigate .",
    "the real - time evolution of heavy ion collisions is another example , which may serve as a strong motivation and an ultimate long - term goal for the development of quantum simulators for gauge theories .",
    "another interesting phenomenon of great relevance in particle physics is the spontaneous breaking and restoration of symmetries .",
    "for example , in the early universe , chiral symmetry was intact before it got spontaneously broken at sufficiently low temperature . in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "one attempts to recreate a droplet of the early unbroken phase and observes its evolution back into the vacuum state .",
    "the time evolution of metastable false vacuum states has been discussed in doomsday scenarios of cosmic evolution , in which the rapid expansion of a bubble of true vacuum wipes out the preexisting false vacuum . in one spatial dimension , string breaking by pair creation and false vacuum decay are similar phenomena , with the dynamical quark and anti - quark playing the role of the walls of the true vacuum bubble .",
    "in fact , as we will see , we can use the same model hamiltonians to quantum simulate both string breaking and false vacuum decay .    in wilson s formulation of lattice gauge theory , the fundamental gauge degrees of freedom are parallel transporter matrices taking values in the gauge group , which are associated with the links connecting neighboring lattice sites on a 4-dimensional euclidean space - time lattice . in lattice",
    "qcd the link variables are @xmath174 unitary matrices with determinant 1 , which constitute an 8-parameter family of continuously varying classical gauge degrees of freedom per link . as a consequence , in wilson s formulation of lattice gauge theory , there is an infinite - dimensional hilbert space already for each individual link , which largely complicates the construction of quantum simulators .",
    "quantum link models are an alternative formulation of lattice gauge theory , in which the fundamental gauge degrees of freedom are represented by discrete quantum variables , so - called quantum links , which have a finite - dimensional hilbert space per link . in the simplest case of a @xmath0 gauge theory , a quantum link",
    "is simply represented by a quantum spin .",
    "when one chooses spin @xmath175 , a single qubit per link is hence sufficient to represent the gauge field . in an @xmath33 gauge theory",
    "the quantum link is a generalized quantum spin with a continuous gauge symmetry , which has at least 4 discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , two qubits per link are required to represent a non - abelian gauge field .",
    "a @xmath176 quantum link model requires 6 and an @xmath173 quantum link model requires 20 discrete states per link , which amounts to 3 or 5 qubits per link , respectively . for simplicity , in this supplementary material",
    "we limit ourselves to @xmath0 quantum link models in one spatial dimension , considering both the spin @xmath175 representation ( one qubit ) and the spin 1 representation , with 3 discrete states per link .    in this supplementary material",
    ", we discuss quantum link models with a small number of degrees of freedom , which still display the physical phenomenon of string breaking or false vacuum decay .",
    "the proposed model hamiltonians are not yet fully realistic from a particle physics point of view . in particular",
    ", they address the physics of the schwinger model ( i.e.  qed in @xmath177 space - time dimensions ) rather than qcd in @xmath178 dimensions . for simplicity ,",
    "the schwinger model is formulated with so - called staggered fermions , which have only one degree of freedom per lattice site .",
    "it should be pointed out that we are not yet addressing the schwinger model in the continuum limit .",
    "hence , several steps will have to be taken in order to turn the proposed quantum simulations into something that becomes truly useful for particle physics .",
    "still , the pathway towards this ultimate goal is clearly visible .      in order to better understand the theoretical framework of quantum link models ,",
