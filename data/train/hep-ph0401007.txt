    "nowadays we know , that hadrons have a finite size , which in electromagnetic ( em ) interactions is revealed as the em structure of hadrons , phenomenologically to be described by one or more ( it depends from the spin of hadron under consideration ) functions of one variable ( the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath6 of a virtual photon ) , called the em form factors ( ff s ) . if in the vertex with three lines appear one virtual photon and two identical strongly interacting particles , one speaks about the elastic em ff s of hadron . if there is one virtual photon and two different hadrons ( or one hadron and one real photon ) we speak about the transition ff s .",
    "a subgroup of the latter represent the pseudoscalar meson transition ff s , describing any @xmath7 transition , where @xmath8 can be @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    unlike the elastic meson and baryon em ff s , the pseudoscalar meson transition ff s",
    "are not well elaborated till now , though there are special physical problems in which they play an important role .",
    "for instance , there is no evaluation of the @xmath9 contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( in connection with its precise measurement at the e-821 experiment in bnl ) just due to the absence of a reliable behaviour of the corresponding transition ff s in the time - like region .    in this contribution we solve the latter problem by a construction of unitary and analytic models of the pseudoscalar meson transition ff s , which reproduce existing experimental data in space - like and time - like region quite well .",
    "there is a single ff for each @xmath10 transition to be defined by a parametrization of the matrix element of the em current @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the polarization vector of the photon @xmath14 , @xmath15 appears as only the pseudoscalar meson belongs to the abnormal spin - parity series .",
    "a straightforward calculation of @xmath16 behaviour in qcd is impossible and one can obtain @xcite in the framework of pqcd only the asymptotic behaviour @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the meson weak decay constant .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath16 for @xmath19 can be determined from the axial anomaly in the chiral limit of qcd @xmath20    in order to describe the soft nonperturbative region of @xmath21 a simple interpolation formula has been proposed by brodsky , lepage @xcite @xmath22 which , however , does not describe even the space - like data well . as a consequence , in the space - like region ( @xmath23 )",
    "one usually fits the experimentally observed @xmath24 dependence of @xmath25 by a normalized empirical formula @xmath26 where @xmath27=@xmath28 is related to the size @xmath29 of the pseudoscalar meson p.    and in the time - like region ( @xmath30 ) , of the well known vector - meson resonance behaviour , one is left with breit - wigner extension of the vmd model @xmath31 which , however , is justified only at the region of resonances and generally violates the unitarity condition and the normalization .",
    "from all mentioned above it follows that it is highly desirable to construct more sophisticated model of the pseudoscalar meson transition ff s .",
    "there are dominating experimental data on the pseudoscalar meson transition ff s in the space - like region @xcite .",
    "however , recent measurements of the @xmath32 , @xmath33 processes at vepp-2 m in novosibirsk @xcite around @xmath34-meson supplemented older data @xcite at lower energies and they all provide a possibility to carry out a serious analysis of the corresponding ff s .",
    "so , at present day we have all together    * for @xmath0 : @xmath35 33 points * for @xmath1 : @xmath35 52 points * for @xmath2 : @xmath35 59 points .    in the next section",
    "we construct unitary and analytic model of the pseudoscalar meson transition ff s which unifies all known properties of ff s and the existing data will be utilized for an evaluation of free parameters of the model .",
    "so , our intention is to achieve a description of all @xmath36 and @xmath30 data on the pseudoscalar meson transition ff s by one , however , distinct for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , analytic function explicitly known on the real axis of @xmath37-plane from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , respecting all properties of @xmath40 like the asymptotic behaviour ( [ a2 ] ) , the normalization ( [ a3 ] ) , the analytic properties of @xmath41 , the reality condition @xmath42=@xmath43 from which it directly follows a property of the unitarity condition , that the @xmath44 is @xmath45 only from the lowest branch point on the positive real axis of @xmath37-plane to @xmath39 , etc .",
    "the transition ff @xmath41 is suitable to split into two terms depending on the isotopic character of the photon @xmath46 where @xmath47 can be saturated only by isoscalar vector mesons and @xmath48 can be saturated only by isovector vector - mesons , whereby both sets are characterized by the photon quantum numbers .",
    "the analytic properties of @xmath41 consist in the assumption , that @xmath41 is analytic in the whole complex @xmath37-plane besides the cut on the positive real axis from @xmath49 up to @xmath39 , because there is the intermediate @xmath33 state allowed in the unitarity condition of every @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 transition ff , which generates just the lowest branch point @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , from the unitarity condition it follows that there is an infinite number of higher branch points on the positive real axis of @xmath37-plane as there is allowed infinite number of higher intermediate states in the unitarity condition of ff s under consideration . in our model",
    "we restrict ourselves to two square - root cut approximation of the latter picture . in order to fuse such analytic properties into our model",
    "we start with the following 4 resonance vmd model parametrization of ( [ a7 ] ) @xmath50 and apply the normalization condition ( [ a3 ] ) . however , in order to take into account the fact , that @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( unlike @xmath53 ) are not directly measurable quantities , employing the relation for two - photon partial width @xmath54 of the pseudoscalar meson @xmath8 , one comes to a redefinition of the norm through the known partial two - photon width @xmath55 in the following way @xmath56 then from ( [ a8 ] ) one obtains the following condition on coupling constant ratios @xmath57 from which one can express e.g. @xmath58 by all others . substituting the latter into ( [ a8 ] )",
    "one gets the vmd parametrization @xmath59a_{\\omega}+ \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ \\frac{m_{\\phi}^2}{m_{\\phi}^2-t}-\\frac{m_{\\omega'}^2}{m_{\\omega'}^2-t}\\right ] a_{\\phi}+\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ \\frac{m_{\\rho}^2}{m_{\\rho}^2-t}-\\frac{m_{\\omega'}^2}{m_{\\omega'}^2-t}\\right ] a_{\\rho } , \\quad a_i=(f_{i\\gamma p}/f_i )    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to be normalized automatically . in order to obtain from ( [ a12 ] ) the unitary and analytic model ,",
    "we incorporate the two - cut approximation of the true analytic properties by an application of the nonlinear transformation @xmath60",

    "the effective square - root branch points @xmath64 and @xmath65 include in average contributions of all higher important thresholds in both , isoscalar and isovector case , respectively , and are left to be free parameters of the constructed model .",
    "the variable @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) in ( [ a13 ] ) is conformal mapping @xmath68 @xmath69 ; \\quad   q_{in}^s=[(t_{in}^s - t_0)/t_0]\\ ] ] of the four -sheeted riemann surface in @xmath37-variable into one @xmath66-plane ( @xmath67-plane ) .    as a result of application of ( [ a13 ] ) all vmd terms in ( [ a12 ] ) first give the factorized forms @xmath70 on the pure asymptotic term @xmath71 , independent on the flavour of vector - mesons under consideration ( however it depends on the isospin ) and carrying just the asymptotic behaviour @xmath72 of the vmd model , and the so - called resonant term ( the second one in ( [ a15 ] ) ) describing the resonant structure of vmd terms , which however , for @xmath73 is going out on the real constant and so , it does nt contribute to the asymptotic behaviour of the vmd model    the subindex 0 in ( [ a15 ] ) means that still @xmath74=0 of all vector mesons is considered .    in order to demonstrate the reality condition @xmath42= @xmath43 explicitly , one can utilize in ( [ a15 ] ) relations between complex conjugate values of the corresponding zero - width vmd model pole positions in @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) plane @xmath75 and @xmath76 following from the reality that in a fitting procedure of existing data on @xmath41 such @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) is found that @xmath77 and @xmath78    finally , incorporating @xmath79 by a substitution @xmath80 one comes to the unitary and analytic models of @xmath41 in the following form @xmath81= \\left ( \\frac{1-v^2}{1-v_n^2}\\right ) ^2\\cdot \\label{a19}\\\\ & \\cdot & \\left \\{f_{\\gamma p}(0){\\bf { v}}_{\\omega'}+ \\left [ { \\bf{v}}_{\\omega}-{\\bf{v}}_{\\omega'}\\right.\\right ] a_{\\omega } + \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left.\\left [ { \\bf{v}}_{\\phi}-{\\bf{v}}_{\\omega'}\\right ] a_{\\phi}-{\\bf{v}}_{\\omega'}a_{\\rho}\\right \\}+ \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left ( \\frac{1-w^2}{1-w_n^2}\\right)^2{\\bf{w}}_{\\rho}a_{\\rho}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 now , substituting instead of @xmath8 in ( [ a19 ] ) @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we get three different unitary and analytic models for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "they are applied to a description of existing data on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 transition ff s .",
    "@xmath0 : the best description ( see fig.1 ) is achieved with @xmath89 = 23.2 i.e. @xmath90 = 0.83 and following values of parameters :    @xmath91 + @xmath92=@xmath93 + @xmath94=@xmath95 + @xmath96=@xmath97 + @xmath1 : the best description ( see fig.2 ) is achieved with @xmath89 = 47.5 i.e. @xmath90 = 1.01 and following values of parameters : @xmath98 + @xmath99=@xmath100 + @xmath101=@xmath102 + @xmath103=@xmath104    @xmath2 : the best description ( see fig.3 ) is achieved with @xmath89 = 67.4 i.e. @xmath90 = 1.25 and following values of parameters :    @xmath105 + @xmath106=@xmath107 + @xmath108=@xmath109 + @xmath110=@xmath111",
    "we have briefly reviewed the present - day experimental and theoretical situation about the pseudoscalar meson transition ff s and came to the conclusion that there is no reliable prediction of them in the time - like region .",
    "since there are besides quite good experimental information in the space - like region new novosibirsk measurements of @xmath112 annihilation processes into @xmath113 at the @xmath34-meson peak , we have constructed the well founded unitary and analytic model of @xmath86 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 with four vector - mesons and predicted a reasonable behaviour of these transition ff s in the space - like and time - like regions simultaneously .",
    "results can be applied for a prediction of various cross - sections and decay rates in which pseudoscalar meson transition ff s appear , further , an evaluation of contributions of @xmath9 processes into the muon anomalous magnetic moment can be carried out and also the strange pseudoscalar meson transition ff s can be in principle predicted for the first time .",
