    "hickson compact groups of galaxies are small systems of three to seven galaxies with projected separations on the sky of a few galactic diameters and velocity dispersions comparable to the internal stellar motions of the group galaxies .",
    "although several hickson groups have a high projected galaxy density and seem to form a physical group , the hypothesis that a close system in projection is also compact in 3-d is only confirmed when the member galaxies are found to be in interaction with one another .",
    "if so , the low relative velocity dispersion of galaxies in the group as well as the small distances between them will favor the formation of merger remnants ( barnes 1989 ) .    several photometric and spectroscopic indicators of galaxy interactions have been identified in the literature such as shells , ripples , isophote twists , double nuclei , kinematically decoupled cores in ellipticals ( bertola et al .",
    "1988 ) and disturbed rotational velocity curves of disks ( rubin et al .",
    "other useful indicators of galaxy interactions can be found in the cold and warm gaseous component of a galaxy .",
    "cold gas is very important in identifying late - type but not early - type interacting galaxies , since these are mostly devoid of hi ( van gorkom 1991 , van gorkom 1997 ) .",
    "warm gas , in contrast , is present in both early and late - type galaxies and can be used as a tracer of recent or on - going interactions .",
    "although the warm gas component usually contributes only a small fraction of the total mass of a galaxy , it responds very quickly to gravitational perturbations and should therefore allow a detailed study of the recent history of interactions / accretions of the system .",
    "we have begun a program to study the warm gas properties and kinematics of galaxies in a subsample of hickson compact groups with the main aim of identifying interaction and merging signs among the member galaxies and in this way attempt to determine the evolutionary stage of the compact group .",

    "a general trend of constant velocity dispersion with increasing radius of the group was detected for a combined sample of nine x - ray detected groups including hcg 90 suggesting that the groups may be embedded in a common dark matter halo ( zabludoff and mulchaey 1998 ) .",

    "+ in order to convince the reader that the gaseous velocity profiles of h90b+d are separated and can be measured in the region of overlap we plot in fig . 9",

    "the upper pannel indicates with a bold square the region within which the h@xmath0 profiles are shown in the lower pannels .",
    "the lower left and right pannels show respectively the measured profiles and the best gaussian fits to the data ( of fwhm = 63 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "each small square in the lower pannels correspond to a 0.91@xmath3 @xmath10 0.91@xmath3  pixel and a velocity interval of 380 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we can clearly measure both components of h90b and h90d in the overlaping region . *",
    "parabolic velocities + l94 argued that the system h90b@xmath33d is not in interaction .",
    "one of the reasons presented was the fact that the parabolic velocity is much larger than the difference between the two systemic velocities .",
    "we did the same calculation using the gas parameters ( the gas central velocity and the total mass determined from the gas kinematics and the virial theorem ) and we find as parabolic velocities v@xmath34=130 @xmath22 45 km s@xmath6 and v@xmath34=230 @xmath22 55 km s@xmath6 for the systems h90c+d and h90b+d respectively .",
    "this can be compared with the central gas systemic velocity differences of 150 @xmath22 30 kms @xmath6 and 95 @xmath22 30 km s@xmath6 respectively .",
    "errors bars are large , and therefore the discrepancy between the parabolic velocities and velocity differences may be not significant .        combining the gas and stellar kinematic data , we conclude that h90b and h90c may be s0 galaxies . according to l94 ,",
    "the ratio v/@xmath35 of h90c , as measured from the stellar component , is 0.7 for an apparent ellipticity of 0.26 .",
    "this places h90c in the v/@xmath35 _ vs. _ ellipticity diagram of davies et al .",
    "( 1987 ) in the domain of the rotationally supported objects .",
    "our gas study leads to the same conclusion , with v/@xmath35 = 0.87 for an apparent ellipticity of 0.1 .",
    "likewise , for h90b , the stellar v/@xmath35 is 0.6 , for an apparent ellipticity of 0.28 , and for the gas component the v/@xmath35 is 1.6 for an apparent ellipticity of 0.6 .",
    "therefore , both h90b and h90c may be rotationally supported objects .",
    "10 presents the ratio of mass of hii gas to k band luminosity as a function of radius from the center of the galaxy for galaxies h90b , c and d. the hii gas masses have been derived from the calibrated monochromatic images and transformed into mass densities in m@xmath27 pc@xmath16 .",
    "the k band luminosity profiles come from unpublished photometry by mendes de oliveira , transformed into surface density in l@xmath27 pc@xmath16 .",

    "11 are not affected by this uncertainty given that the zero point of the k photometry is identical for the three galaxies .",
    "tables 3 , 4 and 5 give details of the plots shown in fig .",

    "the m@xmath25/l@xmath36 of h90c and h90d raise regularly with approximately the same slope .",
    "the slope of the curve of h90b is , however , very different from those for the two other galaxies .",
    "for h90b the m@xmath25/l@xmath36 increases rapidly from 7.0 m@xmath27 / l@xmath27 at a radius of 4@xmath3 to 5.75 m@xmath27 / l@xmath27 at 15@xmath3 from the center . after that it decreases slowly .",
    "the rapid increase corresponds to the gas excess present in the monochromatic map of h90b ( see fig .",
    "4a ) . between radii 15@xmath3 and 20@xmath3 , the m@xmath25/l@xmath36 ratio increases for h90d while it decreases for h90b .",
    "an analysis made by hibbard et al .",
    "( 1995 ) of the hi content of several merger remnants showed that an increase of the m@xmath37/l@xmath36 in the outer parts of an interacting system is a strong signature of a late - stage encounter .",
    "we can not be as affirmative here , mainly due to the extension of the gas which is very small compared to that for the hi gas .",
    "what we can say , however , is that we detect a significant difference in the behaviour of the m@xmath25/l@xmath36 _ vs. _ radius curve for h90b , as compared to those for h90c and h90d .    in a scenario where h90d is considered as a gas reservoir and h90b is the `` recipient '' , it seems plausible to find a higher amount of gas for h90d and a higher m@xmath25/l@xmath36 ratio in the extreme part of h90b , where the gas exchange is taking place .",
    "* insights from the study of the kinematics and gas content + the values listed in table 2 show that the total ionized gas mass in h90d is four times higher than that for h90b and twice as high as that of h90c .",
    "the values found for the two early - type galaxies , however , even if small , are consistent with previous studies of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of elliptical and lenticular galaxies in other environments ( goudfrooij et al .",
    "1994 , macchetto et al .",
    "1996 ) . what is anomalous in the early - type galaxies h90b and h90c",
    "is not their gas content but their gas kinematics , as summarized below .",
    "+ - h90c : + the strong decoupling between the warm gas and the stellar major axes for this galaxy and the contrast between the well behaved kinematics of the gas and the ` u - shape ' kinematics of the stars along its kinematic major axes suggest that the gas disk of h90c is of external origin .",
    "it may be the result of an interaction .",
    "the gas is relaxed while the stars still feel the effects of a recent interaction .",
    "+ - h90b+d : + the vfs and the monochromatic maps of this system strongly suggest that there is an interaction in progress taking place between these two galaxies . the vfs of the two galaxies are twisted and the vcs show non - axisymmetric motions .",
    "the monochromatic maps show evidence that there is a gas bridge between these two galaxies : there is an excess of ionized gas in the sw side of h90b , towards h90d , and the gas distribution is non - axisymmetric with an extension to the ne side of h90d , in the direction of h90b .",
    "+ l94 concluded that there is no strong observational evidence for an interaction in progress between h90b and d from the stellar kinematics .",
    "this difference between the kinematics of the gas and of the stars can arise , for an example , if the gas component responds more quickly to gravitational perturbations than the stellar component . in this case",
    "the gas kinematics may show evidences of interaction that do not have counterparts in the stellar kinematics .",
    "+ the hypothesis that h90b+d form an interacting system is enforced by the observation that in binary galaxies the interaction is more efficient when the encounter is prograde ( alladin & narasimhan 1982 ) , which is the case for this system .",
    "* insights from other ism phases + other components of the ism of the galaxy members can help determining the evolutionary stage of the compact group hcg 90 .",
    "+ several studies show that hcg 90 has diffuse x - ray emission ( ponman et al .",
    "1996 , mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) .",
    "the emission is not centered on any group member , suggesting that hcg 90 may be a young , dynamically evolving group .",
    "+ h90a is not included in this study but hi observations for this galaxy are available by oosterloo and iovino ( 1997 ) . located at 8@xmath17 or 77 h@xmath6 kpc to the north of the other three members ,",
    "the velocity difference between h90a and the rest of the group is only 100 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the morphology of the hi emission is very disturbed , showing an extension in the direction of the remaining group members ( mainly to hcg 90c ) .",
    "oosterloo and iovino ( 1997 ) concluded that the hi morphology for this galaxy suggests a strong tidal interaction with the other group members .",
    "+ co emission has been detected in hcg 90 by verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) mainly centered on h90d .",
    "however huchtmeier & tammann ( 1992 ) show , from smaller beam data , that h90b also displays significant co emission .",
    "the case of h90c is still not resolved .",
    "verdes - montenegro et al . ( 1998 ) indicate that this member presents only marginal co emission , but they suggest that observations with a smaller beam may be able to confirm their detection .",
    "we suggest the following scenario : h90d is the warm gas reservoir of the group . h90c and",
    "d have experimented a past interaction with gas exchange .",
    "the gas acquired by h90c has already settled and relaxed ( as suggested by the well behaved shape of the gas velocity curve of h90c ) but the effects of the interaction can still be visible in the morphology of the two galaxies and their stellar kinematics ( l94 ) . on the other hand , h90d is now in the process of fueling h90b with gas , a process that will possibly result in a major merger .",
