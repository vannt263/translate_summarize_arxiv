    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are generally believed as the descenders of the low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( alpar et al .",
    "as the formation rate per unit mass of lmxbs is orders of magnitude greater in globular clusters ( gcs ) than in the galactic field ( katz 1975 ; clark 1975 ) , it is not surprise that @xmath4 of the detected msps are located in gcspfreire / gcpsr.html ] ( cf .",
    "manchester et al .",
    "the relatively high formation rate of lmxbs and msps is a natural consequence of the frequent stellar encounters . with the x - ray populations in various gcs",
    "have been revealed by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , pooley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and gendre et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found a positive correlation between the number of lmxbs in gcs and the stellar encounter rate , @xmath2 .",
    "this provides evidence for the dynamical formation of lmxbs in gcs . as the descenders of the lmxbs , msps",
    "are also expected to have a dynamically origin .",
    "very recently , with the corrections of the observational effects in the radio pulsar surveys toward different gcs , hui , cheng & taam ( 2010 ) have found a positive correlation between the msp populations in gcs and @xmath2 , which has long been predicted .",
    "moreover , the authors have also found another positive correlation between the metalicity and the msp population .",
    "this relation is not unexpected as the high metalicity in a gc can result in a more efficient orbital shrinkage by magnetic braking .",
    "therefore , the parameter space for the successful roche - lobe overflow is enhanced ( ivanova 2006 ) and subsequently lead to a higher formation rate of msps .",
    "a brand new window for investigating the msps in gcs has been open by the launch of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope_. since msps are the only steady @xmath0-ray emitters in gcs , observations with _ fermi _ can provide an alternative channel for investigating msp populations . shortly after the commence of its operation , the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard",
    "the spacecraft has detected @xmath5rays from 47 tucanae ( hereafter 47  tuc ) ( abdo et al . 2009 ) .",
    "terzan  5 , which hosts the largest known msp population , has also been subsequently detected ( kong et al . 2010 ) .",
    "as the sensitivity of lat increases monotonically with the continuous all - sky survey , a total of 15 confirmed detections of @xmath5ray emitting gcs have very recently been reported by abdo et al .",

    "on the other hand , tam et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have recently reported 7 other new detections with @xmath7 years data . among all known @xmath0-ray gcs , liller  1 , which has the highest metalicity in our milky way ,",
    "is also found to have the highest @xmath0-ray luminosity ( tam et al .",
    "this discovery further suggests that the effects of metalicity can not be neglected .",
    "thanks to these surveys , we are able to study these clusters as a unique class for the first time .    to explain the @xmath5rays from gcs , there are two main streams .",
    "venter & de jager ( 2008 ) and venter et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest the @xmath5rays are originated from the curvature radiation of electrons in msp magnetospheres .",
    "however , the frequent stellar interactions can lead to a complicated magnetic field structure ( cheng & taam 2003 ) , which can possibly explain the difference of the radio and x - ray properties of msps in gcs with respect to those located in the galactic field ( cf .",
    "hui , cheng & taam 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "one consequence of the complicated surface magnetic field is to turn off the accelerating region for producing high energy photons .",
    "ruderman & cheng ( 1988 ) argue that if the open field lines are curving upward due to the effect of local field then in this case @xmath8 pair production and outflow can occur on all open - field lines . as a result",
    ", the outer - magnetospheric gap is quenched by these pairs .",
    "this scenario is supported by the fact that the msps in 47  tuc are essentially thermal x - ray emitters ( bogdanov et al .",
    "all these demonstrate the potential difficulties of the pulsar magnetospheric model in explaining the observed @xmath5rays from gcs , which motivate the exploration of additional / alternative emission mechanisms .",
    "on the other hand , bednarek & sitarek ( 2007 ) have proposed that the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) could be a possible mechanism to produce @xmath5rays from gcs . in their model",
    "they predict that gcs could be sources of gev - tev photons .",
    "unfortunately they have ignored the contribution from the galactic background photons .",
    "very recently , through generalizing the ics model by including various soft photon fields , cheng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have found that the observed @xmath5ray spectra of all 8 @xmath0-ray gcs reported by abdo et al .",
    "( 2010a ) can be well - modeled by the ics between relativistic electrons / positrons in the pulsar wind of msps in the gcs and the background galactic soft photons .",
    "this provides another possible explanation for the origin of the @xmath5rays .    in this paper , we report the results from exploring the @xmath5ray emission properties by comparing with various cluster properties , which provides us with insight on the origin of the @xmath5rays from this class of gcs . in  2 , we report the method and the results from the correlation and the regression analysis .",

    "ivanova ( 2006 ) proposes that the absence of the outer convective zone in metal - poor main sequence donor stars in the mass range of @xmath103 - @xmath104 , in comparison to their metal rich counterparts can be responsible , since the absence of magnetic braking in such stars precludes orbital shrinkage , thereby , significantly reducing the binary parameter space for the production of bright lmxbs . for a conventional scenario , msps",

    "2010 ; ivanova 2006 ) .",
    "we note that the link between the lmxbs in extragalactic gcs and the metalicity is somewhat weaker than with the cluster mass ( e.g. sivakoff et al . 2007 ; kim et al . 2006 ; kundu et al .",

    "since the relaxation time at the cluster core is generally longer than the lifetime of lmxbs , the cluster is continuously evolved with mass segregation at the cluster center which can result in a varying formation rate of compact binaries ( cf .",

    "abdo et al . ( 2010a ) have argued that the @xmath0-ray emission is magnetospheric in nature because of the hard photon indices and the cutoff energies inferred from the phenomenological model is consistent with the values expected from the magnetospheric model . on the other hand , cheng et al .",

    "in view of the aforementioned complication , it is not possible to discriminate the ics and the magnetospheric scenarios unambiguously simply based on the currently available information .",

    "( 2010a ) are best fitted by the upward scattering of either the galactic infrared photons or the galactic optical photons .",
    "this has prompted us also to discriminate which source provides the predominant soft photon field for ics .",
    "since the ic radiation power is directly proportional to the energy density of the soft photon field , a logarithmic slope of unity is thus expected for the fundamental plane parameters @xmath83 , @xmath89 , @xmath95 and @xmath101 . for the corresponding parameters of @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath89 and @xmath101 ) ,",
    "the line of unity is found to cut through the centers of the @xmath59 error contours for both @xmath2 and [ fe / h ] fundamental plane relations . on the other hand , for the parameters correspond to @xmath15 ( i.e. @xmath83 and @xmath95 ) , the expected value is only marginally intersected with their @xmath61 error contours .",
    "although an unambiguous conclusion can not be drawn from the current population yet , the comparison between the theoretical expectation and the fundamental plane parameters does favor the scenario involving the background infrared emission as the soft photon field for ic upscattering .",
    "we would like to point out that the predicted spectral shape in energy regime much larger than 10 gev is significantly different for different soft photon fields ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 in cheng et al .",
    "therefore , observations with tev facilities , such as magic , hess and veritas , can be feasible to lift up this degeneracy . furthermore ,",
    "as the ics model and the magnetospheric model predict a rather different tev spectrum for gcs ( cheng et al . 2010 ; venter et al . 2009 ) , tev observations in the future can possibly better discriminate these two possible contributions of soft photons .",
    "constraints for the emission model can also be derived from the other energy bands . with the diffusion of the relativistic pulsar wind particles",
    ", it has been shown that extended radio and x - ray emission from the gcs can also be produced by synchrotron radiation and ics respectively ( cheng et al .",
    "this is consistent with the recent discovery of the diffuse x - rays around terzan  5 which exteneded up @xmath114  pc ( eger , domainko & clapson 2010 ) .",
    "although a clear scenario can not be identified yet , these diffuse x - rays are more likely to have a non - thermal origin ( eger , domainko & clapson 2010 ) . assuming these x - rays are originated from the tail of ics , the corresponding @xmath5ray spectrum can be calculated ( cheng et al .",
    "therefore , a systematic search for the extended x - ray and radio feature outside the half - mass radii of the other @xmath5ray gcs can provide us indpendent constraints .    in exploring the fundamental plane relations , our analysis suggests that by combining the soft photon energy densities with @xmath2/@xmath3 $ ] the data scattering can be reduced .",
    "these best - fit relations can provide the indicators in identifying what kind of gcs are potential @xmath5ray sources for a further search . and the other way round , any deeper @xmath5ray search from the gcs can result in an enlarged sample size and a lower sensitivity limit than the current value ( i.e. @xmath115  erg  @xmath10  s@xmath11 ) , which will certainly enable a further test for all these reported relations .",

    "<S> we have investigated the properties of a group of @xmath0-ray emitting globular clusters ( gcs ) which have recently been uncovered in our galaxy . by correlating the observed @xmath0-ray luminosities @xmath1 with various cluster properties , we probe the origin of the high energy photons from these gcs . </S>",
    "<S> we report @xmath1 is positively correlated with the encounter rate @xmath2 and the metalicity @xmath3 $ ] which place an intimate link between the gamma - ray emission and the millisecond pulsar population . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a tendency that @xmath1 increase with the energy densities of the soft photon at the cluster location . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the two - dimensional regression analysis suggests that @xmath1 , soft photon densities , and @xmath2/@xmath3 $ ] possibly span fundamental planes which potentially provide better predictions for the @xmath0-ray properties of gcs . </S>"
