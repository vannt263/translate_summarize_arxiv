    "@xmath354 @xmath355 and @xmath356 but only two of them give non - zero poisson brackets with @xmath59 of generalized degree @xmath357 @xmath358 the corresponding 1-parameter groups of contact transformations have the form @xmath359,\\\\ & [ z_6\\rightarrow z_6 + 5\\,\\lambda\\,z_3 ^ 4,\\quad z_7\\rightarrow z_7+\\lambda\\,z_3 ^ 5],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the omitted variables are left unchanged , and @xmath360 is a parameter .",
    "both transformations preserve the equation of chemical equilibrium , since they do not change the chemical potentials .",
    "the first transformation represents the uniform scaling of pressure and concentrations by the scale factor @xmath361",
    "so it does not affect our considerations .",
    "the second transformation shifts pressure by the value @xmath362 which leads to violation of equality of @xmath76 to zero at zero density and hence has no physical sence , so the term @xmath363 is restricted in any perturbation of the debye - hckel model .",
    "as can be seen from the above examples , the introduced method of generalized normal forms is a flexible instrument for studying the critical phenomena in various physical systems .",
    "it can be used whenever there is a natural symplectic or contact form . to our knowledge , thermodynamic equations of state have never been considered from this point of view . in the context of infinitesimal contact transformations and the corresponding systems of odes ,",
    "normal forms were previously studied only in the case of quasi - homogeneous unperturbed part @xmath59 of generalized degree @xmath236 with weight @xmath364 with generic coefficients ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p  37 ) and references therein ) .    in both examples",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath59 was a quasi - homogeneous polynomial with a canonical weight , and a generalized normal form was obtained rather easily .",
    "however , it is not so for all interesting systems . for example ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath365 where @xmath366 @xmath367 @xmath368 is not quasi - homogeneous for any canonical weight .",
    "such a hamiltonian arises in studying the interaction between two nonlinear oscillators at the level of perturbation .",
    "the problem of stability of the equilibrium for a system with such an unperturbed part was partially solved in @xcite by methods of kam theory : for sufficiently high orders of the perturbation , the origin is lyapunov stable . at low orders",
    "it is natural to deal with a normal form instead of an arbitrary perturbation , since it contains a significantly smaller number of terms . in the general case ,",
    "explicit formulas for minimal resonant sets turn out to be very complicated .",
    "nevertheless , lemma  1 gives an algorithm , which can be used to obtain the leading terms of the poisson brackets , and hence a minimal resonant set , for given @xmath369 and linear order on monomials .",
    "for example , the minimal resonant set for @xmath370 @xmath371 @xmath372 and a lexicographical order determined by the order @xmath373 consists of monomials @xmath374 where @xmath375 and @xmath376 except the following : @xmath377 @xmath378 @xmath379 @xmath380 @xmath381 @xmath382 @xmath383 @xmath384 @xmath385 @xmath386 @xmath387 @xmath388 @xmath389 @xmath390 @xmath391 @xmath392 @xmath393 @xmath394 @xmath395 @xmath396 @xmath397 @xmath398 @xmath399 @xmath400 @xmath401 @xmath402 @xmath403 @xmath404 @xmath405 @xmath406 @xmath407 @xmath408 @xmath409 @xmath410 @xmath411 @xmath412 @xmath413 @xmath414 @xmath415 @xmath416 @xmath417 @xmath418 @xmath419 @xmath420 @xmath421 @xmath422 this set consists of @xmath423 monomials , while in an arbitrary perturbation there are @xmath424 terms at these degrees .",
