    "the stereoscopic imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope array veritas completed a two - year survey of the cygnus region of the galactic plane in very high energy ( vhe ) gamma rays @xcite .",
    "the survey covered the area between galactic longitudes @xmath1 and @xmath2 and galactic latitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a region chosen because it contains both a high density of material and a significant population of potential vhe gamma - ray emitters , including a number of pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) and supernova remnants ( snrs ) . as acceleration of either electrons or nuclei above 1 tev within these stellar remnants can also generate gamma - ray emission , detection of gamma rays from these objects may provide insight into the nature of both the acceleration process within the remnant and the nature of the accelerated population of particles @xcite .",
    "relativistic electrons can produce gamma rays via both non - thermal bremsstrahlung and inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering off nearby optical , ir , or microwave photons . protons and heavier atomic nuclei generate gamma rays via the decay of neutral pions produced by their interaction with interstellar material .",
    "identifying gamma - ray emission from snrs that is produced by pion decay could provide insight into the origin of galactic cosmic rays , by providing evidence that snrs are sites of hadronic cosmic ray acceleration within the galaxy .",
    "while the initial survey yielded no clear source detections , the blind search suggested possible vhe gamma - ray emission at several locations , most notably in the vicinity of the  ( @xmath5-cygni ) .",
    "snr  g78.2 + 2.1 is a @xmath6 diameter supernova remnant ( snr ) @xmath7  kpc distant , with a shell - like radio and x - ray structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is considered young to middle - aged at @xmath8 years @xcite and in an early phase of adiabatic expansion into a medium of fairly low density @xcite .",
    "@xcite also identifies a slowly expanding hi shell immediately surrounding the radio shell .",
    "@xcite suggest this shell was created by the progenitor stellar wind .",
    "most of the radio and x - ray emission lies in distinct northern and southern features @xcite .",
    "the northern region is characterized by enhanced thermal x - ray emission , suggestive of shocked gas @xcite , as well as strong optical emission with sulfur lines @xcite .",
    "however , it evinces little to no co emission @xcite . the gamma - ray satellite _ fermi _  sees diffuse gamma - ray emission above 10 gev from the entire remnant @xcite and has discovered a gamma - ray pulsar , , at the center of the remnant @xcite .",
    "this pulsar , which has a spectral cutoff of 3.0 gev , also has a low luminosity ( @xmath9  erg  s@xmath10 ) and a spin - down age ( 76.8  kyr ) much greater than the estimated age of .",
    "@xcite argue , however , that was likely born with something close to its current spin period , in which case its spin - down age is not indicative of its actual age .",
    "it therefore remains plausible that  is the remnant of s progenitor star @xcite . except where otherwise noted , all gev and tev sources",
    "are considered to be at a distance of 1.7 kpc , the estimated distance of  @xcite .",
    "subsequent to the completion of the veritas cygnus region survey , follow - up observations were taken of the vhe gamma - ray source candidate near .",
    "based on those further observations , we report here the discovery of an extended , unidentified source of vhe gamma rays that lies within an area of enhanced radio emission along the northwestern shell of snr g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "the observational details are described in  [ sec : observations ] ; the analysis and results are presented in  [ sec : analysis ] and  [ sec : results ] , respectively .",
    "we discuss the nature of the tev gamma - ray emission in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the veritas  observatory consists of an array of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona @xcite .",
    "each telescope is equipped with a @xmath11 field - of - view ( fov ) , 499-pixel photomultiplier tube camera .",
    "the array is run in a coincident mode , requiring a minimum of two out of four telescopes to trigger in order for an event to be recorded .",
    "data included in this paper were taken with an upgraded array configuration that has improved sensitivity and gamma - ray point - spread function ( psf ) @xcite relative to that used during the cygnus region survey .",
    "this configuration has @xmath12 energy resolution between 100  gev and 30 tev and a @xmath13 ( standard deviation above background ) point source sensitivity of @xmath14 of the crab nebula flux above 300  gev in less than 30 hours of observation at zenith angles less than @xmath15 .",
    "the observations under discussion were motivated by , but do not include , data from the veritas  cygnus region survey @xcite .",
    "the initial two - year survey covered the area of the remnant with an effective exposure time of  and showed evidence of an extended gamma - ray excess .",
    "the approximate location of the survey excess was re - observed with a set of dedicated pointings during september - november of 2009 , for a total live - time of .",
    "these observations were performed in `` wobble '' mode , with the center of the veritas field - of - view offset by @xmath16 from the target position ( ra @xmath17 , dec @xmath18 ) .",
    "the zenith angle was restricted to @xmath19 for these observations .",
    "approximately @xmath20 of the data were taken at a time when three out of the four veritas  telescopes were operational ; the remaining @xmath21 was taken with the full array .",
    "images from these data are calibrated according to the standard procedure described in @xcite and cleaned using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "after calibration , the primary photon direction is calculated via stereoscopic reconstruction based on the intersection of image primary axes . to ensure that the primary photon direction and energy can be well - reconstructed ,",
    "an initial event selection is applied , requiring that events have three images passing the following criteria : more than four pixels per image , an image centroid no more than @xmath22 from the camera center , and a total integrated charge per image of at least  photoelectrons .",
    "calibrated images are described in terms of a second - moment parameterization @xcite .",
    "cosmic - ray background is rejected using selection criteria applied to two composite parameters based on these moments : mean - scaled length ( msl ) and mean - scaled width ( msw ) @xcite .",
    "we impose the requirements and ; in addition , we require the angle between the reconstructed gamma - ray arrival direction and the source position to be less than @xmath23 .",
    "the chosen background - rejection criteria are optimized for moderate - strength ( @xmath24 of the crab nebula flux ) extended sources . together with the image quality requirements they impose an energy threshold for this measurement of .    to minimize the number of independent search elements , our search is restricted to a pre - defined circular region with radius @xmath25 centered on the target position . in the imaging analysis and source",
    "morphology studies the ring background model @xcite is used to estimate the residual cosmic ray background ; the reflected - region model @xcite is used when extracting the spectrum .",
    "we also excluded from the background estimation circular regions with radius @xmath26 around four bright stars in the fov ( @xmath5 cygni , p cygni , 40 cygni , and hip100069 ) as well as two overlapping circular @xmath27-radius regions used to approximate the profile of the excess seen in the veritas  survey data @xcite .",
    "all results reported here have been verified by an independent calibration and analysis chain .",
    "figure  [ fig : excesswithoverlay ] displays the background - subtracted , acceptance - corrected tev image of the region of . a clear signal with  net counts is detected at the location of the northern rim of the remnant .",
    "this signal is significant at the  level after accounting for all test points in the pre - defined @xmath25 search region .",
    "figure  [ fig : excesswithoverlay ] also shows the locations of the gamma - ray pulsar  ( ) ,  from  at the center of the snr , and the centroid of the emission from the remnant seen by _ fermi _  above 10 gev .",
    "the morphology of  is derived from a binned extended maximum - likelihood fit to the counts map before background subtraction .",
    "the cosmic ray component is modeled as an exposure - modulated flat background and the source by a symmetric two - dimensional gaussian convolved with the veritas point spread function ( psf ) ( @xmath28 containment radius of , derived from an identically processed observation of the crab nebula ) .",
    "we find a fitted extension of .",
    "the fitted centroid coordinates are ; however , we maintain the identifier  for the source , which was originally assigned on the basis of a preliminary centroid estimation .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in this location is @xmath29 , with a combined systematic uncertainty in the position , due to the telescope pointing error and systematic errors of the fit itself , of @xmath30 .",
    "figure [ fig : tevspec ] shows the spectrum derived from the reconstructed gamma - ray events within from the center of the search region ; runs where only three of four telescopes were operational have been excluded from this sample .",
    "the threshold for the spectral analysis is and the energy resolution is at 1 tev . the photon spectrum is fit well (  ) by a differential power law in energy , @xmath31 , between and 10 tev , with a photon index of and a flux normalization at 1 tev of . the integral flux above ( ) corresponds to of the crab nebula flux above that energy .",
    "no other significant tev source is found in the maps .",
    "figure  [ fig : rosat ] presents an exposure - corrected rosat pspc @xmath32  kev image of  generated from archival data ( see @xcite for observational details ) .",
    "the tev gamma - ray emission overlaps a region of enhanced x - ray emission coincident with the bright radio arcs associated with the northern rim of the snr shell . as the highly absorbing column to the remnant screens out most source photons below @xmath33  kev , we excluded all photons below this energy to suppress background .",
    "several bright x - ray sources are associated with known stars and have been identified in previous work , but none of these overlap the vhe gamma - ray - emitting region @xcite .    to better study the enhanced x - ray emission overlapping the tev contours , we also re - analyzed the data from asca sequence # 25010000 previously studied by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : asca ] shows the @xmath34 kev exposure - corrected x - ray map , generated by co - adding data from the two gas imaging spectrometers .",
    "the image is consistent with that seen by .",
    "we extracted source and background spectra from the two @xmath35 elliptical regions displayed in figure  [ fig : asca ] and generated count - weighted response files appropriate for diffuse emission .",
    "the source region , centered on coordinates ra  @xmath36  @xmath37  @xmath38 , dec  @xmath39  @xmath40  @xmath41 ( j2000 ) and oriented with position angle @xmath42 , contains the bulk of the x - ray emission located within the veritas  contours .",
    "the background ellipse , centered at ra  @xmath36  @xmath43  @xmath44 , dec  @xmath39  @xmath45  @xmath46 ( j2000 ) with position angle @xmath47 , is placed where the x - ray emission is evidently at background level in the rosat image .",
    "the source spectrum was grouped with a minimum of 20 counts per channel and fitted in the @xmath34  kev range using the xspec software package .",
    "the spectra are evidently soft with few net counts above @xmath48  kev after background subtraction .",
    "a significant line feature is found at 1.9   kev ; we do not , however , find any evidence for the strong ne line feature at @xmath49 kev reported by @xcite .",
    "we modeled the x - ray spectrum using an absorbed raymond - smith thermal plasma model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ascaspec ] ) .",
    "this provides an adequate fit with @xmath50 .",
    "the best - fitted temperature is @xmath51 kev .",
    "si is overabundant by a factor of @xmath52 relative to solar .",
    "the column density is @xmath53 and the normalization is @xmath54 . the absorption - corrected flux for this model is found to be @xmath55 in the 0.5@xmath568.0  kev band .",
    "we also considered that the plasma behind a shock expanding in a low - density medium might not have had time to reach ionization equilibrium given the assumed snr lifetime , in which case the spectrum would be better modeled by a non - equilibrium ionization model .",
    "we attempted to fit the asca spectrum with an absorbed non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model , the `` vgnei '' model of xspec , but were unable to obtain good constraints on the fitted parameters .",
    "we also attempted to constrain the flux of any possible power - law component in the spectrum by adding a power - law with photon index fixed to 2.0 and then varying the power - law normalization until the @xmath57 increased by 2.7 ( @xmath21 confidence level ) relative to the best fitted model with no power - law component .",
    "we place an upper limit on the flux of a power - law component of @xmath58 in the 0.5@xmath568.0  kev band .",
    "we note that our result differs significantly from that given in @xcite .",
    "while we have chosen a source region similar to their `` r1 '' source region , we find that our fits to the asca spectrum require neither an additional power - law component nor a large ne ix line feature .",
    "the discrepancy seems to be caused by the choice of background region .",
    "we selected a background region that was as close as possible to the source , in order to account for the large variance in the galactic emission in this part of the plane .",
    "@xcite considered four nearby asca pointings and chose the one with the least source contamination , @xmath59 from the center of the `` r1 '' region .",
    "a choice of background region similar to uchiyama s allows us to reproduce the previously - reported nonthermal component and spectral features .",
    "we have discovered a spatially extended source of vhe gamma - ray emission , , located on the northwest rim of the shell - type supernova remnant .",
    "the tev gamma - ray emission is coincident with the leading edge of a prominent arc - shaped radio continuum feature along the snr rim ( fig .",
    "[ fig : excesswithoverlay ] ) and with a region of enhanced x - ray emission that we identify as thermal in origin ( figs .",
    "[ fig : rosat ] ,  [ fig : asca ] , and [ fig : ascaspec ] ) .",
    "lies near the inner edge of a slowly expanding hi shell immediately surrounding the radio shell identified in 21  cm line observations @xcite ; it also lies near a region of bright [ sii ] optical line emission within the snr that is identified as shock - heated gas based on the [ sii]/h@xmath60 line ratio @xcite .",
    "there are also two gev sources associated with .",
    "one is a pulsar , , located at the center of the remnant @xcite .",
    "the other is an extended source candidate reported above 10 gev by _ fermi _",
    "a point source co - located with  was previously reported in the first and second _ fermi _  catalogs but @xcite conclude that it was an artifact of failing to model the extended source above 10 gev rather than a separate source .",
    "between g78.2 + 2.1 and the cyg ob2 association ( roughly @xmath61 away ) lies a 50 parsec - wide area of 1 - 100 gev gamma - ray emission , detected by _ fermi _ , that has been interpreted as a cocoon of freshly - accelerated cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the tev gamma - ray emission and the features observed in the x - ray , optical , and radio continuum can be most simply related to the presence of shocks at the interaction of the supernova ejecta and the surrounding medium .",
    "has a relatively low interior density and , as previously noted , appears to be surrounded by a dense hi shell @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest this hi shell was created by the progenitor stellar wind as it swept up the ambient medium .",
    "the interaction of the supernova shock with the hi shell might drive a shock into the dense shell and a reflected shock back into the cavity .",
    "emission arising from these shocks would then account for the observed [ sii ] lines , enhanced thermal x - rays , and strong radio continuum emission near .",
    "shocks can produce tev gamma - ray emission via either inverse - compton scattering of accelerated electrons or hadronic interactions of accelerated nuclei .",
    "high - energy electrons capable of producing tev photons via inverse - compton scattering should also produce x - ray synchrotron radiation detectable as a non - thermal power - law in the x - ray spectrum . while our analysis of the asca x - ray spectrum shows no evidence for a non - thermal component , the upper limit on this component is not yet strong enough to rule out inverse - compton scattering as the source of the tev , if not the gev , gamma - ray emission .",
    "deeper x - ray observations of  should provide better constraints .",
    "the flux of tev photons from hadronic processes depends on the energy available for shock acceleration and the density of the target material .",
    "one of the prerequisites of this scenario is that the necessary density of target material , as inferred from the gamma - ray flux , be consistent with that estimated from measurements at other wavelengths .",
    "equation 9 in @xcite gives ( on the assumption that the spectrum of the charged particles is a power law with index of @xmath62 ) the expected gamma - ray flux above a given threshold energy as a function of the threshold energy @xmath63 , the fraction @xmath64 of the sn kinetic energy @xmath65 converted to cosmic rays , the distance @xmath66 of the snr , and the density @xmath67 of the target material ,      for @xmath69  gev , @xmath70  kpc , @xmath71 as expected for a remnant in the early sedov phase , and assuming @xmath72  erg , which is consistent with estimates derived from optical data @xcite , we find that a density of  is required to produce the observed tev flux . however , this equation is for the total flux integrated over the whole spherical shell of a snr .",
    "the gamma - ray emission from ver j2019 + 407 is confined to a relatively small portion of the snr shell .",
    "thus , it is likely that only a fraction of the sn blast wave participates in the shock acceleration producing the tev gamma - ray emission .",
    "assuming an isotropic explosion , we account for this by scaling @xmath65 by the ratio of the surface area covered by ver j2019 + 407 to the total surface area of the remnant . using the fitted 95@xmath73 ( 68@xmath73 ) containment radius of the tev gamma - ray emission gives a correction factor of 0.5 ( 0.14 ) .",
    "once uncertainties in the source extension , integral flux , and snr distance are also taken into account , the average density required to produce the observed tev flux above  increases to .",
    "we find these densities consistent with our knowledge of the region from other wavelengths . given that no significant co emission is detected in this area of the remnant",
    ", any target material must be atomic rather than molecular , with the necessary high density perhaps arising in the swept - up h i shell .",
    "@xcite estimated a gas density of 2.5  @xmath74 in the h i shell surrounding the remnant , consistent with the range of densities derived from the tev data .",
    "optical data also shed some light on densities in the vicinity of ver j2019 + 407 .",
    "mavromatakis gives the ratio of [ sii ] @xmath756716 to [ sii ] @xmath756731 line fluxes at multiple locations within g78.2 + 2.1 , one of which is close to ( although not precisely coincident with ) ver j2019 + 407 .",
    "all of these ratios are close to one , and , within a plausible range of temperatures , imply post - shock densities on the order of a few 100  @xmath74 .",
    "mavromatakis infers these densities to be arising behind a radiative shock and estimates a primary shock velocity of @xmath76 km / s , consistent with that inferred from an x - ray temperature of @xmath77 kev .",
    "he deduces pre - shock cloud densities on the order of @xmath78  @xmath74 , which are not unreasonable given the average densities inferred here from the gamma - ray flux .",
    "the shock velocities inferred from the optical and x - ray data , however , are too low for the forward shock to accelerate particles to tev energies at the present time .",
    "any hadronic tev gamma - ray emission would have to arise from particles accelerated during an earlier epoch that are only now interacting with the shell .",
    "the limited angular extent of the tev gamma - ray emission also raises questions .",
    "if we view the sn blastwave as expanding in the low - density bubble blown by the progenitor stellar wind until it reaches the much higher - density cavity wall , why should the interaction favor one portion of the cavity wall over the others ?",
    "asymmetries in the shock propagation , variations in the density of the cavity wall , or the former presence of a cloud ( now evaporated by the shock ) within the low density region could provide an explanation , as could the strength and orientation of the ambient magnetic field relative to the local shock velocity @xcite . given the more symmetric and diffuse gev gamma - ray emission seen from the remnant , asymmetric diffusion of accelerated particles out of the remnant",
    "might also play a role , as the highest - energy particles would be the first to escape .",
    "however , at this stage there is no clear evidence for or against any of these possibilities . in these scenarios ,",
    "could be responsible for some or all of the freshly - accelerated cosmic rays within the cocoon detected by _",
    "fermi_. however , the results shown here can not be used to draw strong conclusions about the cocoon s relationship to  or to set a meaningful upper limit on cocoon emission above 300 gev .",
    "the cocoon contours from @xcite were derived from an analysis where , which is no longer considered an independent source , was included as part of the background model . since this would artificially reduce the intensity of the gev gamma - ray emission seen near , the @xcite contours provide a spatial reference only and should not be used to judge the relationship of the cocoon to . moreover , gamma - ray emission on the scale of the cocoon ( roughly four square degrees ) can not be detected with veritas using the ring - background estimation method , which will cause the source to self - subtract .",
    "analysis techniques better adapted to highly extended sources , combined with further data taken in alternative observation modes , will be required to confirm the presence or absence of cocoon emission and make a definitive statement about s role in feeding the cocoon .",
    "bears some similarity to other well known tev sources .",
    "h.e.s.s .",
    "observations of the shell - type snr rcw 86 have revealed the presence of vhe gamma rays suggestive of a shell - type morphology @xcite .",
    "@xcite have explained the tev gamma - ray emission from rx j0852.0 - 4622 as arising from hadronic emission in a wind - bubble scenario , similar in many aspects to the scenario proposed here .",
    "other explanations of  are also possible . nearly half of galactic tev sources are identified with pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "tev pwne are typically extended sources energized by electrons accelerated in the pulsar wind . because the lifetimes of the electrons can be long",
    ", the electrons can diffuse over large distances from the pulsar and the centroid of the tev gamma - ray emission is often offset from the pulsar @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the luminosity of  in the 1@xmath5610  tev band@xmath79 assuming a distance of 1.7  kpc  is 2% of the spin - down power of , a value within the range seen for pwne . on the other",
    ", @xcite examined the offsets between tev gamma - ray emission and pulsar location for 21 tev sources , and the pulsar , while offset from the centroid of the tev gamma - ray emission , generally lies well within the angular extent of the tev source . in the single case for which the angular offset is significantly larger than the angular size of the tev source ",
    "psr j1702 - 4128/hess j1702 - 420 inspection of the tev image shows tev emission at the pulsar location @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the offset between  and  is several times larger than the angular size of , and we detect no tev gamma - ray emission either at the location of  or in the intervening region between  and the tev source .    finally , it is possible that  is the pwn of an unknown pulsar in the line - of - sight toward .",
    "this scenario could explain the gev and radio continuum emission , but would ascribe the location of  near the [ sii ] line emission and the enhanced thermal x - ray emission within  to chance superposition .",
    "such a scenario can not be excluded at the current time , but could be tested by a sensitive search for the pwn in the x - ray band and also by radio or x - ray searches for the putative pulsar .    in summary , we have detected gamma - ray emission from a region of enhanced radio , optical line , and x - ray emission in the northwestern shell of .",
    "the extended tev source overlaps with gev gamma - ray emission from the remnant but is notably offset from the gamma - ray pulsar which lies outside the 99% confidence contour of ver  j2019 + 407 .",
    "it seems most probable that ver j2019 + 407 arises from particles ( either hadronic or leptonic ) accelerated within the snr shock , although we can not yet rule out the possibility of a line - of - sight coincidence between the remnant and an un - associated pulsar wind nebula .",
