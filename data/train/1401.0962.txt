    "the role of sulphuric acid in the formation of cloud condensation nuclei ( ccn ) is believed to be significant@xcite , on account of its low vapour pressure , relatively high atmospheric concentration and its affinity to water .",
    "however , simple attempts to understand the binary nucleation of sulphuric acid and water in detail have proved problematic .",
    "it is clear that classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) is insufficient for describing this process , since the critical cluster size suggested from experimental data appears to be small , and consequently several extensions and alternatives have been studied @xcite .    one approach , the use of atomistic models that explicitly treat individual molecules or atoms within numerical simulations , has proliferated as a consequence of increasing computational power ; especially based on quantum chemistry methods which treat the electronic interactions explicitly .",
    "popular quantum chemistry methods include electronic density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and m@xmath0ller - plesset perturbation theory ( mpn where n refers to the order of the perturbation ) @xcite .",
    "the usual strategy is to identify the lowest energy molecular configuration and then to use the rigid - rotor - harmonic - approximation ( rrho ) to compute free energies , and thereby investigate cluster stability and nucleation through specific growth and decay routes .",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite is employed by both dft and mpn .",
    "it involves the separation of the wavefunctions of electrons and nuclei followed by a classical treatment of the dynamics of the nuclei .",
    "the dft approach has been used to describe sulphuric acid and water clusters @xcite . in simulations based on such approaches ,",
    "the sulphuric acid and water system has been observed to exhibit proton transfers .",
    "such events are of particular importance in this system and a challenge to the modelling .",
    "a question that arises is whether we can account for such processes correctly while representing the nuclei as classical particles .",
    "might a quantum treatment of the proton dynamics be more accurate ?",
    "perhaps the additional uncertainty in proton position can alter the delicate balance between neutral and ionised structures ? in this paper",
    "we employ path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) to study the quantum nuclear degrees of freedom ( also known as zero - point motion ) of sulphuric acid / water molecular clusters to address this question .",
    "a particular issue for consideration is the level of hydration of a single sulphuric acid molecule that is required for proton transfer to occur , a matter that can be addressed either by zero temperature calculations or dynamics performed at finite temperature .",
    "it has been suggested that the threshold is around three or more water molecules@xcite .",
    "transfer of the second proton was studied by ding and laasonen @xcite who concluded that it is likely for a level of hydration of around eight or nine water molecules .",
    "pimd emulates the quantum behaviour of a particle by using a classical quasiparticle or bead description , a detailed derivation of which is given by @xcite .",
    "the pimd method has been shown to have a significant effect on the properties in some hydrogen bonded systems @xcite .",
    "pimd has been employed previously together with a parametrised version of the pm6 model @xcite ( a semi - empirical model of electronic structure ) to study sulphuric acid and water clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the pimd technique ( using the normal mode transformation @xcite ) increased thermal fluctuations and produced more liquid - like behaviour in systems at a temperature of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the degree of hydration required for the first and second ionisation events for the sulphuric acid molecule , and concluded that the first ionisation takes place when four water molecules are present in the cluster in agreement with earlier work @xcite .",
    "the second ionisation event occurred in the presence of @xmath2 water molecules in contrast with the study by ding and laasonen @xcite though the latter was based on geometry optimisation techniques rather than on molecular dynamics .",
    "as the purpose of this paper was to gauge the importance of zero - point motion in the sulphuric acid and water system as accurately as possible , it was decided to use dft rather than the semi - empirical pm6 model developed by @xcite .",
    "we study the importance of zero - point motion in a small cluster of sulphuric acid and water using pimd @xcite as implemented in the castep code@xcite .",
    "section [ sec:2methods ] describes the theory used , section [ sec:3results ] details our results , and section [ sec:4conclusion ] concludes our study where we comment on the significance of zero - point motion in the sulphuric acid and water system .    a 16 bead representation of a system containing one sulphuric acid and four water molecules : the distribution of bead positions conveys the quantum uncertainty . ]",
    "according to the pimd technique each particle ( nucleus ) is represented by a set of quasiparticles ( known as beads ) connected by harmonic springs .",
    "the following hamiltonian describing the bead dynamics can be derived using the trotter approximation @xcite : @xmath3\\ ] ]    under the condition @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of beads and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the position and momentum of bead @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the harmonic frequency of the inter - bead springs and is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the system temperature and the boltzmann constant respectively . while @xmath14 denotes the mass of the particle , the mass of the beads",
    "is represented by @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the classical potential in which the particle moves .",
    "the quantum nuclear behaviour is reflected in both the position and momentum of the beads under the influence of this hamiltonian , which is controlled by the stiffness of the inter - bead springs .",
    "since the latter is proportional to the mass of the particle , the hydrogen nucleus is expected to be the most susceptible to zero - point effects .",

    "the spatial separation of the beads clearly illustrates the greater positional uncertainty of the hydrogen nuclei compared to that of the oxygen and the sulphur nuclei .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations at @xmath17 incorporating both classical nuclear dynamics and pimd were performed using the castep @xcite ( version @xmath18 ) code .",
    "the standard on - the - fly ultrasoft pseudopotential provided internally by the castep code was employed for all calculations .",
    "the perdew - burke - ernzerhof @xcite ( pbe ) functional was used with a plane wave basis set .",
    "the pbe functional has been found to perform well for hydrogen bonded systems@xcite .",
    "a cut off energy of @xmath19 was found to converge the plane wave basis set sufficiently for all systems studied . a time step of @xmath20 was used for classical ( single bead ) simulations and a time step of @xmath21 or shorter was used for the pimd simulations due to the stiffness of the inter - bead springs .",
    "castep utilizes the born - oppenheimer version of ab initio md and the langevin thermostat with a friction constant of @xmath22 was used in all simulations .",
    "the equilibration period was judged by observing when the running mean energy of the system had relaxed ( usually requiring less than @xmath23 ) and also by monitoring the distribution of cluster temperature ( or kinetic energy in the centre of mass frame ) , which ought to be approximately gaussian @xcite with a standard deviation ( @xmath24 ) obeying @xmath25 .",
    "a typical temperature histogram satisfying this requirement is shown in figure [ fig : temphistogram ] .",

    "configurations of @xmath29[h_{2}o]_{n=3 - 4}}$ ] were studied at a target temperature of @xmath30 .",
    "pimd uses a certain number of beads to approximate the zero - point motion , and cases with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 beads were tested in this study .",
    "the staging transformation@xcite was used for all pimd simulations .",
    "the @xmath31 case represents the classical limit of the pimd technique and corresponds to the complete neglect of zero - point motion .",
    "the box size of the system was optimised against mp@xmath36 level data @xcite as shown in figure [ fig : binding energy](c ) .",
    "the binding energies , at zero temperature , of the two configurations in figures [ fig : sath and saqh configuration(a ) ] and [ fig : sath and saqh configuration(b ) ] are compared against mp@xmath36 level data .",
    "a box size of @xmath37 was chosen as a compromise between accuracy and computational demand .",
    "molecular configurations likely to feature a dissociated sulphuric acid molecule were identified from the literature and investigated .",
    "one such configuration was labelled iii - i-1 by @xcite and is illustrated here in figure [ fig : config h label ] and denoted config h. our single bead simulations at @xmath17 show that the proton labelled h1 moves with considerable freedom between oxygens o1 and o5 .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : hb hb comparison for dft ] demonstrates an anticorrelation between the length @xmath38 of the dissociating bond o1-h1 and the sum of the lengths of the neighbouring hydrogen bonds , labelled o3-h7 and o4-h6 in figure [ fig : config h label ] , and denoted @xmath39 .",
    "the formation of the ` ionised ' state due to the switch to the o5-h1 bond ( such that the value of @xmath38 is large ) is seen to depend upon the prior existence of both the neighbouring hydrogen bonds ( namely a low value of @xmath39 ) .",
    "if either neighbouring hydrogen bond is broken the system remains ` neutral ' ( with a low value of @xmath38 ) , which is not surprising since the configuration is then similar to the sath structure shown in figure [ fig : geometry - optimised - configuration ] .",
    "this is an important corollary to conclusions acquired from consideration of geometry optimisation at @xmath40 , where config h has been shown to ionise @xcite . at @xmath30",
    "the behaviour can most certainly not be represented by harmonic fluctuations about an ionised mean structure and a free energy based on the rigid - rotor - harmonic - approximation for this configuration would fail due to significant anharmonic contributions .",
    "we shall return to this system in the next section .",
    "a pimd study was performed first for two low energy configurations ( denoted sath and saqh ) identified in the literature @xcite and shown in figures [ fig : sath and saqh configuration(a ) ] and [ fig : sath and saqh configuration(b ) ] .",
    "it is envisaged that hydrogen bonds , in particular those associated with the sulphuric acid , would be the most susceptible to zero - point effects due to the inherent tendency of sulphuric acid to dissociate .",
    "figure [ fig : oolength ] shows the average oxygen - oxygen distance ( @xmath41 ) of specific hydrogen bonds as a function of the number of beads representing atoms in the system .",
    "the bonds labelled hb1 and hb2 in the sath structure contract in length by around @xmath42 with respect to the outcome of classical dynamics while the situation for hb3 is less clear .",
    "note that the longest simulations were performed for the single bead and 16 bead representations of the sath structure , as indicated in table [ tab : timestepdata ] .",
    "for other cases shorter studies were performed to illustrate the trends , though the accuracy of the results is lower .",
    "the average oxygen - oxygen separation @xmath41 of specific hydrogen bonds as a function of the number of beads used in the simulation .",
    "labels hb1 and hb2 refer to figure [ fig : sath and saqh configuration(a ) ] and hb3 is shown in figure [ fig : sath and saqh configuration(b ) ] .",
    "the error bars were determined by the standard blocking procedure @xcite and a blocking length of @xmath43 was found to give independent sampling .",
    "the calculations correspond to the cases listed in table [ tab : timestepdata ] . ]",
    "next we examine in detail how the behaviour of the hydrogen atom in hydrogen bond hb2 is affected by pimd .",
    "this is explored by constructing a potential of mean force ( pmf ) for the hydrogen , defined by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are geometric parameters illustrated in figure [ fig : pmfe ] and @xmath47 is the proportion of simulation snapshots with the hydrogen located within the region defined by @xmath48 and @xmath49 divided by the equivalent proportion for noninteracting particles .",
    "for the pimd simulations the centroid of the beads representing the hydrogen atom was used to produce the pmf .",
    "the method is described extensively by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : pmfb ] and [ fig : pmfc ] show the pmfs acquired using classical md and pimd , respectively , for hydrogen bond hb2",
    ".    the pmf plots in figure [ fig : pmf ] visualise the differences between the dynamics of the hb2 bond in figure [ fig : sath and saqh configuration(a ) ] under classical md and the pimd schemes .",
    "such a comparison is limited by the computationally expensive techniques employed .",
    "however it does offer an insight into the importance of zero - point effects in small clusters of sulphuric acid and water .",
    "the main effect is a shift in the minimum of the pmf of hydrogen bond length @xmath45 by about @xmath50 going from the dft to the pimd result indicating that the zero - point motion has a mean configurational influence on this bond .",
    "figure [ fig : pmfd ] is a one dimensional version of figures [ fig : pmfb ] and [ fig : pmfb ] obtained by integrating over the @xmath46 parameter .",
    "plot of the o1-h1 bond length ( denoted as @xmath51 ) against time in config h in figure [ fig : config h label ] from the @xmath52 bead simulation as detailed in table [ tab : timestepdata ] .",
    "the plot clearly illustrates the motion between the neutral and ionised states . the horizontal line drawn at @xmath53 provides a simple threshold between covalent and hydrogen bond - like behaviour of the o1-h1 bond . under quantum nuclear dynamics",
    "the fraction of time spent above this threshold increases in the order of 10% . ]",
    "the effects of zero - point motion are clearly rather subtle . to explore this further",
    ", we return to the delicate switching behaviour of the o1-h1-o5 bonds discussed in section [ sub : dft ] and contrast the classical and quantum nuclear dynamics . figure [ fig : bimodal ]",
    "illustrates the motion of the proton between the neutral and ionised positions , discussed earlier , in terms of the o1-h1 bond length . which of the nuclei o1 or o5 was the nearest neighbour to the h1 nucleus ( see figure [ fig : config h label ] )",
    "was monitored to quantify this hopping behaviour .",
    "it was found that in the classical case h1 was closer to o1 for @xmath54 percent of the simulation with standard error @xmath55 whereas in the 16 bead pimd simulation this figure dropped to @xmath56 with @xmath57 . .",
    "this property was further investigated by defining a threshold for the o1-h1 bond length below which the system is considered neutral , and beyond which it is better described as ionised .",
    "we define a @xmath58 distance to separate the two regimes , and this is shown as a horizontal line in figure [ fig : bimodal ] . for the classical dynamics , the percentage of time the system remains neutral according to this criterion is @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "an analysis of the pimd simulation with 16 beads yields a corresponding percentage of neutral residence time of @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "these results are consistent with those determined from the nearest neighbour criterion .",
    "the proportion of time spent in the ionised configuration rises from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "this suggests that the inclusion of zero - point motion promotes the formation of the ionised state ; quantum uncertainty favours proton transfer .",
    "as a consequence of the computational expense of the pimd technique , especially when using many beads , the simulations presented are limited in duration to around @xmath65 for some configurations , and rather less for others .",
    "the statistics on the structural and dynamical behaviour are therefore preliminary .",
    "however , it is possible to extract some important features from these simulations that correspond to intuitive expectation , and which can be explored further with more extensive calculations .",
    "our study of small clusters of water and sulphuric acid molecules leads us to two main conclusions .",
    "firstly , we have demonstrated that molecular dynamics can reveal features that are not available from knowledge of the geometry optimised structure at zero temperature .",
    "the prime example of this is the complex behaviour of cluster configuration iii - i-1 identified by @xcite @xcite and here denoted config h. this configuration has been regarded as the most stable ionised configuration for the trihydrated sulphuric acid molecule @xcite , but our results indicate that the structure exhibits both neutral and ionised characteristics at @xmath30 .",
    "this conclusion highlights the limitations of the rrho approximation@xcite for free energy estimation using a single optimised structure .",
    "secondly , the inclusion of zero - point motion through pimd simulations of the sulphuric acid - water system has been shown to produce small but clear structural distortion at @xmath30 in a selected number of configurations when compared with classical dynamics .",
    "the mean oxygen - oxygen separation of hydrogen bonds hb1 and hb2 in the structure shown in figure [ fig : sath and saqh configuration(a ) ] is reduced by @xmath42 .",
    "we observe a mild shortening of the hb2 hydrogen bond length , shown by constructing potentials of mean force for the classical and pimd schemes , as illustrated in figure [ fig : pmf ] . furthermore",
    ", our results indicate that zero - point motion brings about a greater propensity for proton transfer in the o1-h1-o5 substructure of the configuration shown in figure [ fig : config h label ] at @xmath30 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the paper by @xcite where quantum nuclear effects on the hydrogen bond are studied , specifically figure 3 in reference - ",
    "@xcite where the oo length is compared with the length of the projection of the covalent oh bond on the oo vector .",
    "the implication is that the projected covalent bond length is increased by quantum effects when the hydrogen bond is considered to be strong , as judged by a shift in vibrational frequency of the covalent oh bond due to the presence of the hydrogen bond .",
    "our research supports the view that the zero - point effect is most significant in configurations where proton transfer is intrinsically likely .",
    "classical and pimd simulations of the cluster shown in figure [ fig : config h label ] have demonstrated frequent proton transfer . using an o - h separation of @xmath53 as a threshold for distinguishing the ionised from the neutral state ,",
    "the cluster is found to remain neutral @xmath59 of the time ( @xmath60 ) with classical md and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) according to pimd .",
    "it is possible to infer that quantum effects have increased the degree of proton transfer .",
    "it is expected that simulations at lower temperatures would increase the significance of the zero - point effects , making this an avenue for future research .",
    "in addition , since substances such as ammonia and amines are increasingly thought to be relevant to atmospheric nucleation @xcite , assessing the importance of zero - point motion in these systems would also be of interest .    in summary , zero - point motion does affect the structure of small clusters of sulphuric acid and water , particularly the lengths of hydrogen bonds . at @xmath66 ,",
    "the contribution appears to be most significant for cases that are intrinsically susceptible to proton transfer .",
