    "generically , exchange maps with flips have periodic points and so are not transitive ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , for every even @xmath5 there exist transitive cets with flips defined on @xmath1 subintervals ( see @xcite ) . in this article",
    "we extend this result : we determine for which pairs @xmath6 there exists a transitive cet defined on @xmath1 subintervals and having @xmath2 flips .",
    "we look for the least number of subintervals and flips required for a cet to be transitive .",
    "as remarked by keane @xcite , every cet with flips defined on two subintervals has a periodic point , and thus is not transitive .",
    "thus we begin by looking at cets defined on three subintervals .",
    "the examples presented in this paper then work as building blocks of transitive , uniquely ergodic cets having arbitrary numbers of subintervals and flips .",
