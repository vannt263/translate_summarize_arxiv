    "high precision optical photometry from space telescopes is a milestone for modeling of eclipsing binary systems , where current models can not reproduce very small amplitude variations adequately .",
    "even though , reasonable light curve modeling of these systems provides not only absolute physical properties , but also reveals additional small amplitude light variations beside the eclipse events and binarity effects ( i.e. reflection , gravity darkening , etc ... ) .",
    "this leads us to find accurate position of the components of these system on hr diagram and evaluate their variation nature more accurately .",
    "there is a few indicators to reveal the internal layers of the stars .",
    "one of them is the stellar pulsation .",
    "unfortunately the pulsations can not be observable for each star .",
    "on the other hand , the initial analysis and some studies in the literature , such as @xcite , indicated that kic7385478 is one of the candidates for the eclipsing binaries with pulsating component .",
    "moreover , the pulsation behaviour seen in the stars is very important pattern to understand the stellar itself and its evolution . according to the observations lasting as long as several decades indicate that there are several type pulsating stars such as cepheid , @xmath4 doradus , and @xmath6 scuti type pulsating stars in the instability strip in the hertzsprung - russell diagram , especially on the main sequence .",
    "all these types are separated by their locations in the instability strip from each other . analysing the pulsation frequencies , which is generally known as stellar",
    "seismology called asteroseismology , the physical processes behind both the pulsating nature and stellar interiors can be revealed .",
    "this is why the pulsating stars have an important role to understanding stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "kic7385478 is an interesting eclipsing binary whose out - of - eclipse variation does not seem regular .",
    "the system was identified as a variable star in asas catalog ( asas j195058 + 4259.8 ) for the first time @xcite with a variation period of 1@xmath7.6551 and @xmath8 color of 0@xmath9.661 .",
    "variation amplitude in @xmath10 and @xmath11 filters are given as 0@xmath9.12 and 0@xmath9.19 , respectively .",
    "later , @xcite compiled the @xmath0 eclipsing binary catalog , including kic7385478 .",
    "extracted high precision light curves , ephemeris , period and effective temperature estimation for most of the system are provided in the catalog .",
    "the catalog provides effective the temperature of kic7385478 as 6477 @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite revised the temperature to 6735 @xmath12 .",
    "more recently , @xcite estimated the effective temperatures of the primary and the secondary components of kic7385478 as 6346 @xmath12 and 4719 @xmath12 , respectively , which are based on spectral energy distribution fitting .",
    "the ephemeris and the period were revised by @xcite , who provided eclipse timing analysis of the system .",
    "their analysis revealed the orbit of a third body physically bound to the eclipsing binary and they estimated the minimum mass of the third body as 0.27 . beyond these studies",
    ", there is no comprehensive analysis of the system published so far .    in this study , we focus on spectroscopic and photometric modeling of the system . in the next section",
    "we give summary of photometric observations , and spectroscopic observations including reduction process .",
    "section  [ s3 ] comprises spectroscopic , orbital and light curve modeling together with calculated physical properties and evolutionary status of the system .",
    "in addition we further give analysis on residuals from light curve modeling in order to investigate out - of - eclipse light variations .",
    "in the final section , we summarize and discuss our findings .",
    "there is no  @xmath13  photometric filters in photometer of the @xmath0 space telescope , hence @xmath0 photometry contains no color information .",
    "however , response function of the photometer covers a very broad wavelength range , which is between 4100   and 9100   and this allows to collect photons from a large part of the optical spectrum and increases the photometric precision , thus enables to detect light variations with a sub - milimag amplitude , such as planet transit and small amplitude oscillations .",
    "photometric measurements are collected in short cadence and long cadence mode , which have typical exposure times of 58.89 seconds and 29.4 minutes , respectively . in this study",
    ", we use long cadence ( 29.4 min ) data of kic7385478 available at @xmath0 eclipsing binary catalog .",
    "we consider detrended and normalized fluxes @xcite in the catalogue .",
    "however , observations from quarter 12 and 13 are not included in the catalogue data file , hence we downloaded data files of these missing quarters from mast data archive center , in _ fits _ format . in order to evaluate these data together with the catalogue data , we consider simple aperture photometry ( sap ) measurements in the _",
    "fits _ data files of quarter 12 and 13 .",
    "then we detrend and normalize sap fluxes as described in @xcite .",
    "the final data set covers @xmath54 years of time span with 65722 data points in total .",
    "mast archive reports 0.9% contamination level in the measurements , which indicates negligible contribution to the measured fluxes of kic7385478 , if any .",
    "we carried out spectroscopic observations of kic7385478 by 1.5 m russian  turkish telescope equipped with turkish faint object spectrograph camera ( tfosc ) at tubitak national observatory .",

    "noise ratio ( snr ) of observed are between 80 and 145 , which are estimated via photon statistic .",
    "we further obtained high snr spectra of @xmath18psc ( hd222368 , f7v , @xmath19 ) , and hd184499 ( g0v , @xmath20 ) to use as radial velocity template and spectroscopic comparison .",
    "we used standard iraf packages and tasks to reduce all observations . in each observing run",
    ", several bias and halogen lamp ( flat field ) frames were obtained as well as comparison lamp ( fe - ar ) images , just before or after the target star observation . in the beginning of the reduction process",
    ", master bias frame obtained from nightly taken 8 - 10 bias frames were subtracted from all object , fe - ar comparison lamp and halogen lamp frames .",
    "then , normalized master flat field frame was produced from bias corrected halogen lamp frames and all target and fe - ar spectra were divided by the normalized flat field frame .",
    "cosmic rays removal and scattered light corrections were applied to the bias and flat field corrected images .",
    "the spectra from reduced frames were extracted with iraf task `` @xmath21 '' under noao.imred.echelle package .",
    "fe - ar images were used for wavelength calibration and finally wavelength calibrated target star spectra were normalized to the unity by using cubic spline functions .",
    "instead of the published effective temperature estimations in the literature , we use the advantage of having medium resolution spectra of the system to estimate the spectral type and effective temperature , which would be more accurate .",
    "our preliminary light curve analysis indicates that the secondary component makes @xmath515% contribution to the total light of the system , which means the contribution of the secondary component in the spectra taken around secondary minimum would be negligible in our resolution .",
    "we have a good spectrum taken at orbital phase @xmath50.45 ( see table  [ t1 ] ) where the signal of the secondary component fairly diminishes in the resolution of our spectrum , so that we mainly observe the spectrum of the primary component .",
    "we adopt this spectrum as @xmath22 for the primary component and compare it with the observed spectra of @xmath18psc and hd184499 .",
    "the comparison shows that the primary seems hotter than the both standard stars , therefore , we switch to synthetic spectrum fitting method .",
    "in general , we use the latest version of python framework @xmath23 , which provides easy use of various synthetic spectrum calculation codes . among these codes , we adopt spectrumgrayro / spectrum / spectrum.html ] code @xcite and calculate synthetic spectra by using atlas-9 @xcite model atmospheres in conjunction with line list from the third version of the vienna atomic line database ( @xmath24 ) @xcite .",
    "grids of model atmospheres are taken from the temperature range between 6000 k and 7500 k in steps of 250 k and gravity ( log @xmath25 ) range between 4.5 and 3.5 . in all calculations ,",
    "we adopt 2  of microturbulence velocity and solar metallicity .",
    "calculated spectra are convolved with a gaussian line - spread function to match the resolution of the reference spectrum and this convolution is done either by auxiliary program @xmath26 provided by the spectrum code or by built - in function of @xmath23 code .",
    "however , we do not consider the rotational broadening and other broadening mechanisms , which could be ignored due to the relatively large instrumental broadening in our spectra .",
    "the models with the temperature 7000 k and log @xmath25 values 4.5 and 4.0 provide very close matches to the reference spectrum . however , calculated physical properties of the system show that the log @xmath25 value of the primary component is 4.27 ( see section  [ s3.4 ] ) .",
    "we also use synthetic spectrum fitting routine in @xmath23 , which mainly adopts method of minimizing @xmath27 value of the difference between the reference spectrum and synthetic spectra . for this purpose , we choose wavelength region of 4750  5700   and executed fitting routine by fixing log @xmath25 value and choosing different starting parameters for the temperature and metallicity .",
    "this method confirmed primary star temperature as 7000 k and solar metallicity assumption .",
    "this temperature corresponds to the @xmath28 spectral type according to the calibration given by @xcite .",
    "considering calculated error of the temperature from @xmath27 minimization method , temperature steps in atlas-9 grids and current resolution of the observed spectra , uncertainty of the temperature is estimated to be 200 k. we plot the observed reference spectrum and the best matched synthetic spectrum in figure  [ f1 ] , for three different regions .",
    "we calculate radial velocities of the system by cross - correlating each observed spectrum with a template spectrum using @xmath29 task in iraf @xcite . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath18psc as the template since it provides the most similar spectrum to kic7385478 and obtained with the same instrumental setup .",
    "we consider absorption lines in chelle orders 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 , which cover 5000 - 6800  , except strongly blended lines and broad lines , such as h@xmath30 and na i d lines . in figure",
    "[ f2 ] , we show cross - correlation functions of two spectra obtained around orbital quadratures .    we give log of observations in table  [ t1 ] , together with measured radial velocities and their standard errors .",
    "orbital phases in the table are calculated via ephemeris and period given in @xcite , which we also adopt for further analysis .",
    "investigating table   [ t1 ] , one can easily notice the large standard error values for the measured radial velocities of secondary component .",
    "this is primarily caused by the small contribution of the secondary component to the total spectrum of the system , which can be evaluated from the cross correlation peaks of components given in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "we note that 3600 s of exposure time corresponds to 0.025 orbital phase step and estimated radial velocity shift during this exposure time is about 8 at the orbital quadratures for the secondary component , and much smaller for the primary component .",
    "these shifts are negligible compared to the standard errors of the measured radial velocities , therefore we can safely ignore the velocity shift due to the long exposure time .",

    "it may also be noticed that light level around 0.75 phase is slightly higher than the light level around 0.25 phase ( see figure  [ f4 ] , panel @xmath44 ) , which means this effect is dominant through 4 years of @xmath0 observations .",
    "difference in the depth of the primary and secondary minima is another important feature of the light curve , which indicates large difference between the temperatures of the components .",

    "since the effective temperature of the primary component is at critical location where the convective outer envelope is very thin or almost becomes radiative , we carried out solutions by setting gravity darkening ( @xmath45 ) and albedo ( @xmath46 ) values to 0.32 and 0.5 , respectively ( for convective envelopes ) and setting both parameters to 1.0 ( for radiative envelopes ) . in both cases , there is almost negligible difference between solutions with radiative envelope and convective envelope assumption , where convective envelope assumption leads to a slightly lower residuals , thus we continue with 0.32 and 0.5 values for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",

    ", @xmath49 is defined as the ratio of the axial rotation rate to the orbital rate .",
    "linear limb darkening coefficients ( @xmath50 ) of the components are adopted from @xcite .",
    "we start analysis with detached configuration , therefore we consider inclination of the orbit ( @xmath51 ) , temperature of the secondary component ( @xmath52 ) , dimensionless omega potentials of the primary and the secondary component ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , luminosity of the primary component ( @xmath55 ) as adjustable parameters . in addition , we observe a general phase shift of 0.002 in the phase binned light curve , which possibly arises from a shift in the adopted ephemeris due to the third body @xcite , hence we also adjust phase shift during analysis . in a few iterations ,",
    "we observe that the @xmath54 value jiggles around the inner critical potential value and secondary component has entirely filled its roche - lobe in the corresponding roche geometry .",

    ", we consider distorted shape of the secondary component and adopt @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath56 as adjustable parameters during iterations . after a few iterations ,",
    "we achieve statistically the best parameter set , however , we still observe that the residuals from the solution exhibit additional wave - like variation through an orbital cycle .    during the iterations , we noticed that the contribution of the secondary component to the total light is not more than 15% , therefore we expect negligible contribution from the secondary component to the wave - like variation in residuals",
    ". the most possible explanation could be that the roche - lobe filled secondary star transfers its own mass to the primary component through the inner lagrange point , l1 , of the system .",
    "the transferred mass possibly hits directly to the photosphere of the primary component without forming an accretion disk , thus forms a local region warmer than the surrounding photosphere .",
    "therefore , we consider this hot region as a bright spot on the primary component and add a single bright spot into our light curve model . at first step , we adopt spot longitude and radius as adjustable parameters together with eclipsing binary parameters and fixed the spot co - latitude and temperature factor to 45@xmath57 and 1.03 , respectively . after these parameters are adjusted , we fix the spot longitude and radius , and adjust spot co - latitude and temperature factor . until we achieve the best solution , we adjust different number of spot parameters simultaneously with a different combinations .",

    "physical properties of the components suggest that the low mass secondary component has already evolved off the main sequence before the dwarf primary component , which is not expected in the scope of the stellar evolution theory .",
    "continuous mass transfer between the components could explain this situation , which could change the roles ( and masses ) of the components in long time scales . if the mass transfer does not lead to a disk , a hot spot forms on the photosphere of the mass gaining component , where the streaming matter directly hits to its photosphere .",
    "almost continuous @xmath0 long cadence photometry through four years indicates a brightness level difference between orbital quadrature phases ( i.e. 0.25 and 0.75 phases ) , which could be explained by this kind of a hot spot on the primary ( mass gaining ) component . at that point",
    ", the assumption of an impact system ( no disc ) can be justified by the mass ratio ( 0.22 ) and fractional radius of the primary ( 0.21 ) according to lubow - shu criterium @xcite for disc formation .",
    "furthermore , we do not observe any emission feature in h@xmath30 , indicates the absence of the disk and this is consistent with impact system assumption .",
    "the position of the primary component on hr diagram corresponds to the middle of the region where @xmath4 doradus variables are located and suggests intrinsic light variations related to pulsation .",
    "when we subtract the eclipsing binary model from the long cadence data , we see clear signal which has a dominant period of @xmath50.5 day indicating @xmath4 doradus type pulsations and confirms the intrinsic variation suggested by the position on hr diagram .",
    "however , we also observe occasional increase in the amplitude of the residuals where the dominant period becomes the orbital period , including @xmath50.5 day variation as a smaller amplitude variation .",
    "multiple frequency analysis of the residuals results in 735 frequencies , where the first two frequencies indicate @xmath4 doradus type pulsations , while the third and the fourth frequencies correspond to the orbital frequency .",
    "most of the remaining 731 frequencies correspond to either the orbital frequency or its harmonics .",
    "this indicates an additional light variation with a period almost identical to the orbital one and this variation is usually suppressed by the light variation originating from pulsations .",
    "figure  [ f7 ] and figure  [ f8 ] clearly show that the amplitude of the orbital frequency varies in time and this causes broad and shallow peak structure at the orbital frequency in amplitude spectrum of 4 year data , which is another evidence for the additional light variation mentioned above .",
    "possible star spot activity originating from the cool secondary component could easily cause this kind variation , thus leads to many low and high order combinations of the pulsation and orbital frequencies in the amplitude spectrum , especially in period analysis of continuous long term data , which covers @xmath54 years in case of kic7385478 .",
    "it is also known that stellar magnetic activity may cause orbital period modulations via mechanism proposed by @xcite .",
    "another possibility for orbital period modulations is variable mass transfer rate in the donor .",
    "since the typical time scales for applegate mechanism and variable mass transfer rate are decades or longer , these are not comparable to the modulations observed in residual data of kic7385478 , therefore are not likely .",
    "estimated spectral type and luminosity class of the secondary component provide support for the spot activity possibility . according to the eclipsing binary model , 14% contribution of the secondary component to the total light",
    "is expected at very broad band @xmath0 filter , which means we may observe small amplitude light variation due to the possible spot activity of the secondary star . however , when we check the observed spectra of the system , we do not observe any emission feature in ca ii h & k lines , which are very sensitive to the chromospheric activity in cool stars .",
    "considering the temperatures and radii of the components , one may easily conclude that the contribution of the secondary component to the total light around 3950    is almost completely negligible , hence , considering only the spectroscopic indicators , we may not arrive at the conclusion on the existence of star spot activity in case of kic7385478 .",
    "therefore , we can still speculate that the secondary component might have star spot activity , which seems the most possible cause of the occasional amplitude increase in the light residuals .",
