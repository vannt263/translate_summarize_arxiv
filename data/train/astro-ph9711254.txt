    "the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068 is one of the nearest and brightest seyfert galaxies and thus one of the closest candidates for an actively accreting supermassive black hole .",
    "its distance is about 15mpc , corresponding to 73pc/@xmath5 .",
    "cores of seyfert galaxies are classified as types 1 and 2 , with type 1 exhibiting broad and narrow lines while the spectra of type 2 show only narrow lines .",
    "unified theories of agn propose that all agn harbour a continuum source surrounded by a dusty molecular torus .",
    "depending on the observer s viewing angle this torus either obscures the view on the inner source ( type 2 ) , or it does not ( type 1 ) ( antonucci and miller 1985 ) . for ngc1068 bailey et al .",
    "( 1988 ) find from nir spectroscopy a rather low @xmath6 , perhaps as small as @xmath7 .",
    "the extinction is wavelength - dependent and much less in the near infrared , allowing for a deeper look towards type 2 cores in the ir .",
    "accordingly , the first high - resolution ir observations of ngc 1068 exhibited a spectacular compact central ir core and an underlying galaxy ( chelli et al .  1987 ; blietz et al .",
    "1994 ; tacconi et al .",
    "1994 ; young et al .  1996",
    "; weinberger , neugebauer , matthews  1996 ; quirrenbach , eckart , thatte  1997 ; thatte et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "recent investigations of the center of _ our _ galaxy indicate that the difference between it and a seyfert core is not of a generic nature but rather a question of the _ current _ level of activity ( mezger , duschl , zylka  1996 = mdz96 ) . for our galactic center",
    "it was shown by duschl and lesch ( 1994 ) and  in more detail  by beckert et al .",
    "( 1996 = bdm96 ) that the radio - ir spectrum of the central source sgr a * can be explained as optically thin synchrotron radiation of quasi - monoenergetic relativistic electrons .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by a flux density @xmath8 between a maximum flux in the fir range and a low frequency turnover at @xmath9 ghz due to synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) .",
    "recently , muxlow et al .",
    "( 1996 = mph96 ) have presented spectacular merlin interferometry observations of the central radio structure of ngc1068 between 5 and 22ghz .",
    "they have separated the core into 5 components with a minimum distance between individual components of @xmath10 mas .",
    "all but one of the components show negative spectral indeces @xmath11 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while the remaining component shows a positive index of @xmath14 .",
    "mph96 identify this component as the true center of ngc1068 , in so far as resembling the nuclear source of our galaxy , sgr a*.    in this letter we present speckle masking bispectrum observations of the core of ngc1068 in the k - band with a resolution of 76 mas , give the flux at 2.2 @xmath15 m , and discuss the nuclear radio - ir spectrum of this seyfert galaxy .",
    "the ngc1068 speckle interferograms were obtained with the 6 m telescope at the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ) in russia on october 3 , 1996 .",
    "the speckle interferograms were recorded with a 256@xmath16256 pixel nicmos3 camera through a standard k - band filter with center wavelength of 2191 nm and fwhm bandwidth of 411 nm .",
    "a typical speckle frame is shown in fig .",
    "the exposure time per frame was 200ms , k - band seeing was about 15 .",
    "778 object speckle interferograms and 526 reference star ( hic12014 ) interferograms were recorded .",
    "the scale was 30.82 mas / pixel and the field of view 79 @xmath16 79 .",
    "diffraction - limited images were reconstructed from the speckle data using the speckle masking method ( weigelt 1977 ; lohmann , weigelt , wirnitzer  1983 ; pehlemann , hofmann , weigelt  1992 ) .",
    "the process includes the calculation of the average power spectrum and the average bispectrum and the subtraction of the detector noise terms from those .",
    "the 4-dimensional bispectrum of each frame consisted of @xmath17 49 million elements .",
    "no postprocessing by image restoration methods was applied to the speckle masking reconstructions . for the calibration of the flux the photometric standard star hic110609 ( @xmath18 bs 8541 ) , chosen from elias et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , was observed on september 30 , 1996 .",
    "we adopt the hic110609 flux to be 12.57 jy at 2.2 @xmath15 m .",
    "the top diagram of fig . [ vis ] shows the azimuthally averaged visibility function of ngc1068 together with the corresponding uniform - disk ( ud ) and gaussian fits .",
    "the object visibility function was obtained by compensating both , the seeing - calibrated speckle transfer function and an additional transfer function due to the different spectra of ngc1068 and the reference star hic12014 ( k0 ) . on the bottom diagram",
    "the analogous plots are shown for the reference star hic12014 .",
    "the hic12014 visibility function was obtained by reducing two different data sets of hic12014 .",
    "the reconstructed visibility function of ngc 1068 decreases to about 50% of the zero - frequency value at the diffraction cut - off frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the low - frequency peak is caused by the underlying galaxy .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the short horizontal part of the visibility function at @xmath20 is caused by an additional point source or by an overestimation of the transfer function due to the different spectra of ngc1068 and the reference star .",
    "the decrease of the ngc1068 visibility function is much larger than the errors ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ vis ] ) .",
    "for example , between 10% and 70% of @xmath19 the visibility function decreases by about 25% , which is approximately three times larger than the 8% error at 70% of @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , future observations will be useful to confirm the result and to improve the accuracy .",
    "the diameter of the resolved ngc1068 core was derived from the reconstructed visibility function by fitting symmetric uniform disks ( ud ) and gaussian models .",
    "the fits were carried out in the range between 20% and 70% of @xmath19 . the fitted diameters @xmath21 ( fwhm ) and @xmath22 of the gaussian and the ud model are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "these diameters correspond to 2.2 pc @xmath25 0.5 pc and 3.7 pc @xmath25 0.8 pc , respectively .",
    "an alternative model interpretation of the decreasing visibility function is , for example , an object slightly larger than the above diameters plus an unresolved central object or an object which is unresolved in one direction ( @xmath17 ew ) , but resolved in the direction perpendicular to it ( @xmath17 ns ) .",
    "figure [ rek ] shows the diffraction - limited speckle masking reconstruction of ngc1068 .",
    "the resolution of the reconstructed image is 76mas .",
    "it shows an elongated structure in the northern direction , i.e. approximately the position of the radio jet .",
    "figure [ rad ] shows the azimuthally averaged radial plots of the reconstructions .",
    "photometry was performed by comparing the integral intensities of the long - exposure images of ngc1068 and the photometric standard star hic110609 .",
    "it yields for the flux @xmath26 of ngc1068 in the k - band the value @xmath27 .",
    "> from this value we have to subtract the flux of the underlying faint extended component in order to get the flux @xmath28 of only the 30mas component .",
    "we determine the contribution of this extended component from the zero - frequency visibility peak discussed above to 20% @xmath25 10% of @xmath29 .",
    "this results in a flux from the 30mas component of @xmath30 .",
    "mph96 showed that the central @xmath31 have substructures on a scale of 100mas requiring observations with a resolution of better than @xmath32 to separate the true nuclear spectrum from that of surrounding sources .",
    "only a few published radio flux determinations of the nucleus of ngc1068 have a sufficiently high angular resolution to allow the separation of individual nuclear components and thus to use it for physical investigations of the nucleus property .",
    "fortunately , our speckle observations have the required high angular resolution ( 76 mas ) .",
    "therefore , our resolution would allow the separation of the individual core components discussed by mph96 if present in the ir .",
    "we assume that the single source that we have observed in the k - band is the same as the true nucleus observed by mph96 .",
    "our observations constitute an upper limit to the volume from which the above determined @xmath33 originate .    usually , the k band flux from nuclei of seyfert2 galaxies is attributed either to a warm dust torus or a compact nuclear stellar cluster or a combination of the two ( e.g. , thatte et al .",
    "if our source is the torus that is held responsible for the different appearences of seyfert1 and 2 galaxies , our observation constitute the first determination of a torus size . to clarify the nature of the radiating source , further spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements with a similarly high angular resolution are necessary .",
    "however , a combination of the flux measurements and nuclear source identification by mph96 in the radio frequency regime with our observation makes it intriguing to speculate whether a sizable fraction of @xmath28 could originate from the very nucleus of ngc 1068 rather than from the torus .",
    "this could be achieved in a scattering halo above and below the nuclear torus . in this halo",
    "a large part of the flux could be isotropically scattered rather than absorbed and thermalized in an opaque torus along our direct line - of - sight to the nucleus .",
    "@xmath28 lies only about a factor of two above the extrapolated @xmath8 spectrum derived for the range around 10ghz : the spectral index @xmath34 between 5ghz and the k band amounts to @xmath35 .",
    "we note that this value is very similar to that of other galactic nuclei , like sgr a * ( bdm96 ) , m81 ( reuter and lesch 1996 ) ; m104 ( jauch and duschl , in prep . ) , where @xmath36 .",
    "if ngc 1068 has the same spectral shape as these other galactic nuclei , then a fraction of @xmath28 could indeed be contributed from the nucleus of ngc 1068 .    however , one has to admit that very little is known about the true nuclear spectrum of ngc1068 in the intermediate frequency range . to persue our speculation ,",
    "we assume  as a working hypothesis  that also between 22ghz and the ir range , the spectrum goes like @xmath4 .",
    "we then follow bdm96 and interpret this as optically thin synchrotron radiation of quasi - monoenergetic electrons .",
    "the mean electron energy then is fairly well constrained since the maximum of @xmath37 has to be at frequencies above the k band , but not much higher as otherwise the total nuclear flux from the center of ngc1068 would be too large .",
    "the situation is less clear with the ssa frequency .",
    "we can not rule out that ssa in fact occurs at frequencies even smaller than 5ghz . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the source radius discussed below is only a lower limit .",
    "for details we refer the reader to bdm96 .    if we assume that the maximum of @xmath37 is indeed achieved around 2@xmath15 m , and that ssa of the source becomes important for frequencies below 5ghz , we find as emitting region a homogeneous sphere of radius @xmath38 cm ( @xmath39 ) with a magnetic field @xmath40 g ( assumed to be the same everywhere in this region ) .",
    "the relativistic electrons have a number density @xmath41 , a mean energy @xmath42gev and a width of the energy distribution @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "[ figspect ]  we show a comparison of the observed fluxes of ngc1068 core and our model spectrum using the above parameters .",
    "if our speculation applies , it turns out that the main difference between ngc1068 and other galactic centers analysed on the basis of the same interpretation ( sgr a * : bdm96 ; m81 : reuter and lesch 1996 ; m104 : jauch and duschl , in prep . )",
    "are the source radius and - especially - the energy of the relativistic electrons .",
    "the above size of 0.01mas means that our resolved 30mas object is not the synchrotron source itself but rather a larger object , most likely the nuclear torus and/or a circumnuclear scattering halo .",
    "we have resolved a compact source with a diameter of @xmath44mas in the core of ngc1068 .",
    "this object is most likely a nuclear torus and/or a circumnuclear scattering halo .",
    "part of the radiation from the central 30mas may be light from the nucleus scattered in the halo . under this assumption",
    ", we were able to determine physical parameters of the nucleus and compare them to other galactic centers , active and non - active ones .",
    "one then is tempted to speculate that the higher efficiency of the acceleration mechanism for the electrons may be the true difference between an active galactic center and a normal one .",
