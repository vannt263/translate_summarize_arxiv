    "observational efforts during the past decade have brought marked progress in characterising the lower end of the main sequence down to and beyond the hydrogen - burning limit , and identifying a class of unambiguously substellar objects .",
    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) are commonly defined as compact objects with a mass below the minimum for sustaining equilibrium hydrogen fusion ( @xmath1 ) . since the detection of the first bona - fide bds @xcite and the discovery of a jupiter - mass companion to 51peg by mayor & queloz",
    "@xcite , the field of substellar astronomy has seen the direct detection of more than 300 ultracool dwarfs and the indirect detection of 110 planetary mass objects in orbit around other stars . while there is no agreement yet whether brown dwarfs should be distinguished from extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) based on their formation history , or by defining the minimum mass for deuterium burning ( @xmath2 ) as the lower limit of the bd mass range , in terms of atmospheric properties and spectroscopic appearance there is a smooth transition , and some overlap , between both classes of objects , regardless of definition .",
    "the spectroscopic characterisation of these sources of 2200k@xmath3700k has prompted the introduction of the two new spectral classes l and t. while the original description of the l sequence was based on optical spectral properties @xcite , the definition of a classification scheme for the latest l - type and the t dwarfs has required the use of near - ir spectra , owing to the fact that the lion s share of emitted flux and of spectroscopic characteristics in these objects is found at @xmath4 m @xcite .    while the youngest / most massive brown dwarfs jointly populate the early l ( and late m ) classes together with the least massive hydrogen - burning ( very low mass- , or vlm- ) stars , more evolved brown dwarfs of late - l type have effective temperatures similar to those of the egps closest - in to their primary star ( \" , e.g.  51  peg , hd  209458 @xcite ) .",
    "the coolest t dwarfs detected to date @xcite exhibit atmospheric properties close to those anticipated in egps at larger separation , and thus are crucial test cases for our understanding of planetary atmospheres .",
    "the spectral appearance of substellar objects , proceeding from the lowest - mass main - sequence stars to lower effective temperatures is mainly characterised by the onset of condensate formation in the latest m dwarfs , leading to strongly dust - dominated atmospheres of early l - types with very red @xmath5-colours . from mid - l to early t - types this trend",
    "is reversed with a decreasing signature of dust , strengthening of water vapour absorption and the appearance of methane .",
    "the strongest ch@xmath6 bands at 3.3 and 2.2 m have been observed in dwarfs as early as l5 @xcite .",
    "the l / t transition is thus now defined by the first appearance of the weaker band at 1.6 m @xcite .",
    "while the near - ir spectra of t dwarfs are turning blue again with decreasing @xmath7 , caused by the deepening molecular bands and collision - induced absorption ( cia ) of h@xmath8 in the @xmath9-band , their optical - infrared colours become extremely red due to the massively pressure - broadened resonance lines of nai and ki .",
    "chemical interaction , the complex spectra of molecules , the physics of dust formation and the treatment of line broadening in high density conditions make spectral modelling of brown dwarfs and giant planets a challenging task . with advancements in computational techniques and availability of better chemical and physical input data over the years , models of the atmospheres and interiors ,",
    "@xcite have been able to keep up with observational progress in their ability to describe the global properties of brown dwarfs . in this review ,",
    "we present an introduction into dwarf atmosphere modelling with the ` phoenix ` code in sect .",
    "[ phoenix ] , followed by an overview of the current status of models and recent developments in sect .",

    "we discuss the special case of modelling the irradiated atmospheres of close - in extrasolar giant planets in sect .",
    "[ planets ] and discuss the outlook to possible direct observations of egps .",
    "http://www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/phoenix/[`phoenix ` ] ( see @xcite and references therein ) is a general stellar model atmosphere code for treating both static and moving atmospheres , designed to be both general enough to allow essentially all astrophysical objects to be modeled with a single code , and to make as few approximations as possible .",
    "successful applications of the ` phoenix ` code include models of novae , all types of supernovae @xcite and hot stars @xcite . compared to these cases cool stars and brown dwarfs",
    "are in many respects simpler instances of the classical stellar atmosphere problem , i.e.  the photospheres can be considered as plane parallel and the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium , local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) and flux conservation at each level hold to a high degree .",
    "complications arise from the need to treat convection into optically thin layers , highly non - grey opacities that cause extreme deviations of the radiation field from that of a blackbody , and the prevalence of molecules at low temperatures .",
    "molecules first appear at temperatures of about 5000k , and dominate the conditions in m dwarfs , locking up hydrogen and most of the metals .",
    "this dramatically increases the complexity of the equation of state ( eos ) as chemical interactions of hundreds of species have to be considered simultaneously .",
    "the ` phoenix ` code currently solves for the chemical equilibrium ( hereafter ce ) partial pressures of 40 elements with usually 2 to 6 ionization stages each , over 600 molecular species @xcite , and over 1000 liquids and crystals from a study by sharp & huebner @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium models , however , can only describe the conditions , under which condensates _ may _ be formed , but not the actual nucleation rate and growth of grains .",
    "therefore , two limiting cases for the presence of dust in the photosphere have been described by allard et al .",
    "@xcite , referred to as ames - dusty and ames - cond .",
    "while in both cases dust is assumed to have formed wherever it can under ce , removing refractory elements from the gas phase , the former models consider all grains to remain at the place where they formed , while the latter assume that dust will completely settle to deeper layers and does not contribute to the opacity at all .      with the electronic , vibrational and rotational transitions of molecules being orders of magnitude more complex than atomic line spectra , the handling of up to several @xmath10 line opacities poses a computational problem of its own .",

    "the strongly broadened alkali d1/d2 lines , special damping profiles @xcite are used .",
    "combined dust extinction profiles for power - law grain size distributions with 1 , 2 , 10 and 100 times the standard ism values ( full lines from bottom to top respectively , where the two first curves are nearly undistinguishable ) . the scattering and absorption contributions of the 100 ism profile are also shown ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the conditions are typical of the upper photospheric layers in a 1800k ames - dusty model atmosphere ( see allard et al .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "the structures seen in the profile at @xmath27 m are due to dust absorption ( mg@xmath8sio@xmath6 at 10 and 16.5 @xmath28 m and mgal@xmath8o@xmath6 at 13 @xmath28 m ) .",
    "scattering contributions dominate below @xmath29 m , but remain modest in the ir for all but the largest grain sizes .",
    "the absorption profile shows little sensitivity to grain sizes . ]    for models where dust opacity is considered ( ames - dusty ) , extinction from 31 grain species are currently included , with absorption and scattering cross - sections calculated using the mie formalism applied to spherical grains @xcite .",
    "figure  [ gsize ] shows the combined extinction from all dust species included in our eos , which provide an essentially continuous opacity , though several pronounced features exist in the mid - ir , due to e.g.  the absorption peaks of silicates and corundum ( al@xmath8o@xmath30 ) .",
    "an uncertain factor in these calculations is the size of the grains , about which only little is known for the conditions of dense stellar atmospheres . for lack of a better model , a power - law distribution",
    "is frequently assumed , adopting an ism model of @xmath31 for grain diameters 6.25nm@xmath32250 nm .",
    "however , the total extinction per dust mass remains insensitive to particle size as long as the grains remain within the rayleigh limit @xmath33 , and therefore the ir opacity would only be affected if the grains became much larger than in the ism ( cf .  sect .  [ settling ] ) .",
    "the evolution of spectral properties from the hydrogen - burning limit to the coolest observed brown dwarfs is displayed in fig.[mltspectra ] . the transition from m- to l - types",
    "is characterised by disappearance of the optical vo and tio bands , while feh becomes stronger in the red optical and near ir spectrum , and a shift of the ir sed , exhibited in increasingly red ( @xmath34 ) colours .",
    "these changes are explained by depletion of gaseous tio due to the formation of titanates and to a lesser degree the condensation of vo , and the added opacity of silicate grains .",
    "dust extinction blocks efficiently the emission in the optical and tends to smear out the remaining molecular absorption bands , the most prominent being due to h@xmath8o and co.    k , top , with very little dust being formed ) , a young bd ( @xmath35k , middle , with dust opacity included ) and an older field bd ( @xmath36k , bottom , without dust opacity ) .",
    "the most important absorption features are indicated . ]",
    "dusty models such as the middle plot in fig.[mltspectra ] reproduce well the observed spectra of early l dwarfs .",
    "as @xmath7 sinks below 1700k , silicates form at deeper layers , where they affect the emerging spectrum less , the outermost layers can cool and molecular bands begin to grow in strength again .",
    "the cooling also triggers a rapid change from a ce composition where most carbon is bound in carbon monoxide to a carbon chemistry dominated by methane , allowing the much stronger bands of this molecule to shape the ir spectrum .",
    "we can see the end point of this transformation at @xmath7=1000k , with the bottom plot showing an ames - cond model where the atmosphere is dust - free , and water and methane bands are strong . consequently , cool evolved brown dwarfs emit more flux at shorter wavelengths ( in the near - ir @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 broad bands ) , between the strong water vapour and methane bands , than blackbodies of the same bolometric luminosity would predict , and show very blue ( @xmath34 ) colours compared to l dwarfs . this important fact",
    "was already predicted by the model calculations of allard et al .  in 1995",
    "@xcite and confirmed by the discovery of the first evolved brown dwarf , gliese 229b @xcite .",
    "therefore , based upon observational evidence , the latest m and most l dwarfs carry atmospheric dust , whereas late t dwarfs show little or no evidence of condensates contributing to the opacity .",
    "our models presented in sect .  [ structchem ] reproduce these extreme states well , but can not adequately describe the transition between the two .",
    "in fact , in a static equilibrium model there is no solution that allows dust to remain suspended in the photosphere at all , as the grains will eventually sink to lower layers , and take all condensible elements with them until their abundance has decreased below the saturation pressure .",
    "radiation pressure is negligible at such low luminosities and certainly can not provide the force required to keep grains lifted up . because of the relatively inefficient transport of energy by radiation and the large molecular opacities , these cool atmospheres are all convective .",
    "convection can thus provide the essential replenishment of condensible material in the cloud layers .",
    "we therefore understand the presence of dust as a delicate equilibrium between 1 ) the sedimentation of the largest grains by gravity to deeper , hotter layers where they are melted and sublimated , 2 ) the convective updraft of condensible material , and 3 ) the efficiency of the condensation process and growth rate of grains .",
    "it becomes clear from this that the cloud layer can only exist in close proximity to a convection zone , where mixing is still vigourous enough to balance the sedimentation and depletion process . as the radiative - convective boundary retreats with decreasing luminosity",
    ", the cloud top also sinks deeper into the atmosphere .",
    "realising this connection between convective mixing and the presence of dust , various models have been developed to describe the cloud structure ( cf .",
    "the review by marley et al .",
    "the model of tsuji @xcite assumes a fixed grain size and defines a lower limiting temperature @xmath40 , below which grains would coagulate too fast to stay suspended .",
    "the vertical extent of the cloud deck is thus defined by the condensation temperature and @xmath40 , the latter being an empirical parameter that needs to be adjusted by comparison with observations .",
    "a more detailed approach has been developed by ackerman &  marley @xcite , which uses a simplified description of the equilibrium between grain settling and mixing to derive modal grain size and dust density . above the convection zone",
    ", vertical transport is assumed to occur only due to turbulent mixing with a fixed eddy diffusion coefficient .",
    "their model also includes a free parameter @xmath41 to describe the sedimentation efficiency , which again is adjusted to fit the cloud thickness to observations .",
    "they find that observed l dwarf colours can be reproduced well using a relatively small range in @xmath41 @xcite .    in the model used in the current version of ` phoenix ` , allard et al .",
    "@xcite describe a more detailed calculation of the equilibrium between mixing and various condensate growth processes .",
    "vertical transport within the convection zone is calculated according to mixing length theory , and overshoot into the radiative layer is modelled by assuming a velocity law based on the 3d - hydrodynamical simulations of ludwig et al .",
    "the time scales for condensation , coagulation and coalescence , and the sedimentation speed of grains , are currently calculated according to the description of rossow @xcite for cloud microphysics in planetary atmospheres .",
    "the removal of elements from the gas phase by condensation and sedimentation is self - consistently taken into account in the solution of the ce system .",
    "the main differences from @xcite are thus the formulation of a depth - dependent mixing velocity driven by convective overshoot in the radiative zone , and the use of the microphysical time scale approach of rossow , which adds a level of physical detail , though it risks extrapolating results which have only been tested empirically in the very different conditions of solar system planets .",
    "another model based on the work of rossow has been published by cooper et al .",
    "@xcite , though they give no details on their the mixing velocity law , and have not yet included the cloud opacity into the atmosphere structure .",
    "the most advanced and detailed treatment of cloud microphysics to date has been presented by woitke & helling ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cf .  also c.  helling , this volume ) .",
    "their model provides a kinetic description of turbulent mixing and dust formation and precipitation processes , also based on an overshooting velocity field calibrated on hydrodynamical models @xcite . at this stage only one species , tio , is considered , and the computational complexity of these non - local cloud formation models has so far prohibited incorporation into a self - consistent model atmosphere code .",
    "it is worth noting that all these models except @xcite predict the formation of dust grains larger than 1 m , and ranging up to several 100 m  @xcite , in some layers of the atmosphere .",
    "ir extinction coefficients in these models are thus no longer independent of the grain size , and measurements of the near- and mid - ir sed may provide an observational test of the size distribution .    in parallel to the settling into deeper layers it is also possible that the cloud deck is breaking up into smaller features , with the surface coverage decreasing with @xmath7 .",
    "the balance of dust rainout and replenishment by convective upwelling is certainly conductive to the formation of unstable cloud structures , and evidence of this might be found in the very rapid change of the sed and the reappearance of feh absorption bands in early t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "but while observations of both periodic and transient variability in l and some early t dwarfs clearly indicate the existence , and rapid evolution , of surface patterns , no trend for an increase in amplitude has been found that would support a significant change of the cloud fraction towards the l / t boundary @xcite .",
    "the models of ackerman &  marley require a steady decrease in cloud coverage to explain the observed colour change at the beginning of the t dwarf sequence @xcite , while the settling code of allard et al .",
    "@xcite is able to reproduce these broad - band colours with a homogeneous cloud deck , but has not been tested against all changes of spectral features .",
    "more detailed comparison with spectroscopic observations will therefore be required to decide if uniform cloud models can fully account for the transition from dusty to dust - free atmospheres .",
    "a serious obstacle to improving models for ultracool atmospheres is the lack of physical input data for many atomic and molecular opacities .",
    "most existing databases of molecular lines such as hitran @xcite have been compiled for planetary atmosphere studies , and are oriented towards low temperatures .",
    "consequently , they are highly incomplete at energy levels strongly populated in brown dwarf and cool star atmospheres .",
    "stellar atmosphere models therefore rely strongly on the efforts of laboratory spectroscopists and molecular physicists to produce comprehensive experimental and theoretical high - temperature line lists ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* cf .  also s.  johannson , this volume ) .    for dense molecular bands completeness of all relevant transitions ( i.e.  covering all levels populated at temperatures of 5003000k ) , is generally more important to correctly include blanketing effects , than accurate individual line strengths and positions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lbandstds ] , which compares lines from the low - temperature databases with simulations using the stds code @xcite , calculated for transitions from the vibrational ground state , as well as the first ( dyad ) and second ( pentad ) excited levels ( _ hot bands _ )",
    ". for population numbers typical of brown dwarf conditions , lines from each band contribute about the same integrated absorption strength , but distributed over approximately 2@xmath42 , 2@xmath43 , 2@xmath44 and 1.3@xmath45 lines , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the spectra calculated from the geisa / hitran lines and from only the ground - state transitions allow several times more flux to escape between the lines .",
    "the spectra including the hot bands on the other hand converge as soon as @xmath46 lines are included .",
    "the plots , as labeled from the top , show spectra based on the geisa / hitran line list , and on 3 lists calculated with the stds code  @xcite . ]    completeness and accuracy for the ir water bands in the coolest brown dwarfs remains problematic @xcite .",
    "the available data for ammonia bands , which dominate the mid - ir spectrum in late t dwarfs , are even more limited .",
    "in addition , mounting evidence suggests that ch@xmath6/co as well as nh@xmath30/n@xmath8 do not reach their ce mixing ratios in the cool upper layers of t dwarf atmospheres , as some key reaction times could be orders of magnitude larger than the timescale for mixing with warmer layers @xcite . probing molecular abundances at low spectral resolution",
    "is complicated by the strong blending of many bands ( e.g.  co and h@xmath8o at 4.55 m ) , which might be disentangled by high - resolution observations .",
    "the discovery rate of egps has only been slightly behind that of brown dwarfs .",
    "most known egps are associated with a parent star similar to our sun and have very small orbital separations compared to that of jupiter .",
    "their close proximity to a solar - type star makes the modeling of such objects slightly more complicated than brown dwarfs because both the intrinsic interior source of heat and the intense extrinsic solar radiation must be accounted for .",

    "stellar radiation is capable of warming the planet s surface to an equivalent temperature above 1600k , i.e.  conditions similar to dusty l dwarfs .",

    "the exact thermal profile will also depend on the global atmospheric circulation that would redistribute the irradiated energy @xcite . on the other hand , for orbital separations larger than about 1 au",
    "the stellar flux no longer adds significantly to the thermal near - ir egp spectrum , implying that such egps can be well approximated by a non - irradiated atmosphere .",
    "such an approximation is only valid for the thermal radiation emitted beyond 1 m . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the planet s atmosphere reflects the stellar flux , making it appear much brighter than isolated brown dwarfs .",
    "the reflected optical starlight persists out to large orbital distances , as cooler atmospheres form highly reflecting cloud layers ( ices with albedos of 0.5 ) .",

    "independent of the spectral type of the primary ( from g to m ) , the egp at 0.05au has a contrast reaching @xmath51 in the @xmath52 band .",
