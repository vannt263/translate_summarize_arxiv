    "one of the greatest achievements obtained in the past few years in astrophysics is the determination of cosmological parameters with type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) , which suggests an accelerating universe at large scales ( riess et al .",

    "2003 , barris et al .",
    "2004 , knop et al .",
    "2003 , riess et al .",
    "the cosmic acceleration was also confirmed , independently of the sn ia magnitude - redshift relation , by the observations of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( wmap : bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) and the large scale structure in the distribution of galaxies ( sdss : tegmark et al .",
    "2004a , 2004b ) .",
    "it is well known that all known types of matter with positive pressure generate attractive forces and decelerate the expansion of the universe .",
    "given this , a dark energy component with negative pressure was generally suggested to be the invisible fuel that drives the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "there are a huge number of candidates for the dark energy component in the literature , such as a cosmological constant @xmath3 ( carroll et al . 1992 ) , an evolving scalar field ( referred to by some as quintessence : ratra and peebles 1988 ; caldwell et al . 1998 ) , the phantom energy , in which the sum of the pressure and energy density is negative ( caldwell 2002 ) , the so - called  x - matter \" ( turner and white 1997 ; zhu 1998 ; zhu , fujimoto and tatsumi 2001 ; zhu , fujimoto and he 2004b ) , the chaplygin gas ( kamenshchik et al .",
    "2001 ; bento et al .",
    "2002 ; zhu 2004 ) , the cardassion model ( freese and lewis 2002 ; zhu and fujimoto 2002 , 2003 , 2004 ; zhu , fujimoto and he 2004a ) , and the brane world model ( randall and sundrum 1999a , 1999b ; deffayet , dvali and gabadadze 2002 ) .",
    "samples of sn ia sources available in the early analysis contain only sources with redshifts @xmath4 .",
    "although observations of the fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) can constrain the cosmological model up to redshifts as high as @xmath5 ( e.g. , spergel et al . 2003 ) , a more direct measurement of the universe with objects located at very large distances is strongly desired .",
    "fortunately , recent observations extended the sn ia sample to sources with redshifts as large as @xmath6 .",
    "the previous result was confirmed by these high redshift sources and the analysis revealed that before its acceleration the universe underwent a period of deceleration ( riess et al .",
    "the success of including high redshift sn ia sources inspires us to great efforts to search for cosmological rulers with much higher redshifts . based on the @xmath7 relation found recently in a class of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004b ) , dai et al .",
    "( 2004 ) assumed that the grb sources obeying this relation can be used to measure the universe . in their sample of 12 grbs ,",
    "two have redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "soon after their work , the same issue was investigated by many authors ( see ghirlanda et al . 2004a ; friedman and bloom 2005 ; firmani et al .",
    "2005 ; xu et al .",
    "2005 ; liang and zhang 2005 ) .",
    "it was found that current grb data which are lack of low redshift sources could be used to marginalize some parameters in their reasonable ranges ( see xu et al .",
    "2005 for a detailed explanation ) , or they could be employed to constrain the cosmological model with a new bayesian method ( firmani et al .",
    "although the size of the current grb sample is small and low reshift sources are missed , the idea that some high redshift extragalactic sources other than sn ia might be employed to determine the cosmological model is quite interesting and promising .",
    "it would be natural that , for a kind of source which could serve as candles , one assumes a distribution of luminosity , which is reasonable due to fluctuation . as discussed in kim et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the uncertainty of a source must include both the systematic uncertainty and the magnitude dispersion .",
    "we argue that , if there exists a distribution of luminosity of the candles , the expected luminosity itself ( or the corresponding deduced luminosity distance ) could be different from source to source , which would be due to an intrinsic property rather than to the measurement uncertainty .",
    "this raises a topic of finding an appropriate method to estimate cosmological parameter ranges with candles with a certain distribution .    when employing candles such as sn ia or grbs to measure the universe , the confidence level associated with the fit of the theoretical curve to the luminosity distance data was described by a statistic @xmath0 which is defined under the assumption that the measurement uncertainty is the only cause of the deviation of the data to the curve .",
    "the best fit will be obtained when one reaches the minimum value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , for candles with a certain distribution , the deviation of the observed luminosity from the expected curve must be caused by both the measurement uncertainty and the distribution itself .",
    "when taking into account the distribution of luminosity , the @xmath0 statistic could not be defined if the distribution itself is unknown .",
    "the minimizing @xmath0 method will not be applicable if the statistic itself can not be defined .",
    "in the following , we will study how to deal with this matter and investigate what one can expect from the analysis .",
    "a corresponding method will be proposed and will be illustrated with two samples .",
    "in this section , we propose a method to deal with candles with a certain distribution when employing them to constrain the cosmological model .",
    "as mentioned above , the statistic @xmath0 could not be defined for candles with a certain distribution if the distribution itself is unknown .",
    "even if the distribution is known , the statistic is still undefinable since there is no way to know the real luminosity of each source .",
    "these difficulties lead to two problems .",
    "one is that the well - known minimizing @xmath0 method could not be applicable without a definition of the statistic .",
    "the other is that the probability associated with the statistic @xmath9 , if we define it when taking into account the deviation arising from the distribution , is not available ( since the real luminosity of each source is unknown ) .",
    "it is known that the convolution of two gaussian is still a gaussian with a width that is given by the quadratic sum of the two widths of the original distributions .",
    "that is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the variances of the two gaussian functions concerned and @xmath13 is that of the resulted gaussian .",
    "let us consider the deviation of an observed luminosity distance modulus , @xmath14 , of a source from the real value of the quantity , @xmath15 , which follows    @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the measurement uncertainty of @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the central value of @xmath20 , which is the real value of the modulus expected in the case when there is no distribution of the candles , and @xmath21 represents the deviation of @xmath20 from @xmath19 .",
    "suppose that the distribution of candles is narrow enough so that the absolute value of the deviation of @xmath20 from @xmath19 , @xmath22 relative to @xmath19 could be determined by @xmath23relative to the expected central moduli , the @xmath0 statistic of  a sample of the candles could be determined by@xmath24^{2}}{\\sigma _ { ob , i}^{2}+(\\delta \\mu _ { th , i})^{2}}.\\]][note that , in the case of sn ia , @xmath25 should be replaced by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the uncertainty in the individual distance moduli deduced from the empirical relation between the light - curve shape and luminosity and @xmath28 is the uncertainty associated with the dispersion in supernovae redshift ( transformed to units of distance moduli ) due to peculiar velocities ( see riess et al .",
    "2004 ) ]    it seems that , with equation ( 3 ) , one might be able to evaluate the @xmath29 statistic . but because @xmath30 is in no way to be known , this is unfortunately not true .",
    "however , under the condition that the distribution of candles is narrow , we can estimate @xmath30 with the width of the distribution .",
    "let @xmath31 be the width of the distribution of @xmath32 ( called the intrinsic distribution of the relative luminosity distance moduli ) .",
    "( note that @xmath33 should of course become unity when there is no deviation of @xmath20 from @xmath19 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath34",
    ". thus the @xmath0 statistic could be estimated by@xmath35^{2}}{\\sigma _ { ob , i}^{2}+% \\widetilde{\\sigma } _",
    "{ dis}^{2}\\mu _ { th,0,i}^{2}}.\\ ] ]    as long as @xmath31 is provided , the @xmath36 statistic is then available according to ( 4 ) . for any kind of candle , quantity @xmath31 could be estimated when the sample employed is large enough and the measurement uncertainty @xmath17 is small enough and when the cosmological model is fixed .",
    "obviously , this could not be realized at present since the cosmological model itself is currently a target to be pursued and for interesting candles the measurement uncertainty is always quite large . but",
    "this can not prevent one to estimate the limits of @xmath31 .",
    "as the deviation of @xmath37 from @xmath19 is caused by both the distribution of @xmath20 and the measurement uncertainty of @xmath37 itself , @xmath31 must be smaller than @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the width of the distribution of @xmath40 , which is determined by @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being the size of the sample .",
    "let us over estimate the effect of the measurement uncertainty in the opposite way . within the range of @xmath43",
    "$ ] we take the value that is the closest one to @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "obviously , the distribution of @xmath46 would be narrower than the distribution of @xmath32 since the deviation caused by the measurement uncertainty is over subtracted .",
    "we take the width of the distribution of @xmath47 as @xmath48 , which is calculated with @xmath49 .",
    "clearly , @xmath50 must be larger than @xmath48 . with these two quantities we have@xmath51^{2}}{\\sigma _ { ob , i}^{2}+% \\widetilde{\\sigma } _ { dis,\\max } ^{2}\\mu _ { th,0,i}^{2}}\\]]and@xmath52^{2}}{\\sigma _ { ob , i}^{2}+% \\widetilde{\\sigma } _ { dis,\\min } ^{2}\\mu _ { th,0,i}^{2}}.\\]]since @xmath53 , one gets @xmath54 . with equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 )",
    ", one can calculate the corresponding probability associated with the @xmath0 statistic and confine the conventional confidence contour . in this way",
    ", cosmological parameters would be constrained . with this estimating method , the first problem is largely eased and the second is solved .",
    "let us consider a grb sample . the sample was presented and studied in xu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and xu ( 2005 ) ( the xdl grb sample ) which contains 17 grbs .",
    "as suggested in ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , the scatter of the data points of their grb sample around the correlation of @xmath7 found recently ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004b ) is of a very small order .    to check if the data of the xdl grb sample are consistent with no scatter beyond the measurement errors in terms of statistics , the simplest method is to calculate the mean of the deviation of the deduced luminosity distance moduli from the expected one of the sample and then compare it with the average of the measurement error .",
    "the mean of the deviation is defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the expected value of @xmath57 , while the average of the measurement error is calculated with @xmath58 .",
    "( note that , as redshifts of these sources are not the same , we consider the relative values . )",
    "we get the following from the xdl sample : @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where we adopt @xmath61 .",
    "it shows that the deviation is slightly larger than the measurement error .",
    "( ignoring the slight difference between the two quantities , the result confirms what suggested in ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004a , 2004b . ) taking @xmath19 as @xmath56 adopted here , one finds that @xmath62 is identical with @xmath38 defined in last section .",
    "thus , for the xdl sample , @xmath63 , suggesting that the distribution , if exists , would be quite narrow .",
    "another approach involves a simulation analysis .",
    "we assume that there is no intrinsic distribution of the deduced luminosity distance moduli , and thus the deviation observed is due to the measurement uncertainty .",
    "obviously , under this assumption the distribution of @xmath64 should peak at unity .",
    "according to the null hypothesis , the observed value of @xmath56 for each source is obtained by chance from a parent population of @xmath65 whose distribution obeys a gaussian with the measurement uncertainty served as the width of the gaussian . for",
    "each source one can create a @xmath66 via simulation as long as the expected value @xmath56 and the measurement uncertainty are known . in this way , from the 17 @xmath56 and the corresponding measurement uncertainties",
    ", one can create a set of 17 @xmath67 data by a monte - carlo simulation and then obtain a set of 17 @xmath68 data .",
    "we perform 100 times of simulation and get 100 sets of 17 @xmath69 data . combining these 100 sets",
    "we get a large sample with its size being 1700 .",
    "the deviation of the relative simulated luminosity distance moduli from the expected one ( the unity ) is defined as @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath71 could be written as @xmath72 , which could thus be directly compared with @xmath62 , the deviation of the observed data defined above . from the xdl sample we get @xmath73 , which suggests that the deviation associated with observation , denoted by @xmath62 , is also slightly larger than that expected from the measurement uncertainties .",
    "two methods come to almost the same result , suggesting that there might be an intrinsic distribution of the relative luminosity distance moduli of the xdl sample , although it would be quite narrow ( as the difference between @xmath71 and @xmath62 and that between @xmath74 and @xmath62 are small ) .",
    "to illustrate how to apply the method proposed above to deal with data with intrinsic distributions , we assume in the following that there is a distribution of the true value of the deduced relative luminosity distance moduli for the xdl sample , although the distribution , if it exists , might be very narrow ( see what suggested above ) .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we perform the fit with three @xmath0 statistics .",
    "one is the conventional @xmath36 which could be determined by ( 3 ) when taking @xmath75 .",
    "the other two are @xmath1 and @xmath76 which are determined by equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) respectively .",
    "each @xmath0 statistic is calculated with the xdl grb sample in many tries . in each try , we adopt a set of parameters and based on these parameters we deduce both the observed and theoretical luminosity distance moduli . with these moduli and the measurement uncertainties , we are able to evaluate @xmath77 and @xmath38 ( see what proposed in last section ) , and then the corresponding @xmath0 statistic would be well determined ( @xmath78 is adopted throughout this paper ) . for each @xmath0 ,",
    "the best fit will be obtained when the smallest value is reached .",
    "displayed in fig .",
    "1 are the hubble diagram and the confident contour plot of the xdl grb sample . as concluded previously by other authors ( see ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004a ; friedman and bloom 2005 ; xu et al .",
    "2005 ) , currently , employing grb samples alone can not tightly constrain the cosmological model . fig .",
    "1 shows that , the parameter ranges are indeed poorly constrained even there is no intrinsic distribution of the relative luminosity distance moduli ( see solid lines in fig .",
    "taking into account an intrinsic distribution of the moduli leads to much poorer results .",
    "this indicates that if there indeed exists an intrinsic distribution of the moduli , the effect arising from the distribution should not be ignored .",
    "shown in table 1 are the best fit cosmological parameters for the three kinds of universe , obtained by applying the minimizing @xmath36 method to the three @xmath0 statistics , where the @xmath79 errors are estimated from the corresponding @xmath79 contours in fig .",
    "1b . as shown in fig .",
    "1b , the @xmath79 contours are not closed within the ranges of the plot .",
    "this leads a poor constraint to the limits of the parameters .",
    "some limits are therefore not able to be determined , which are denoted by `` ? '' in table 1 .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the fact that the parameter ranges are poorly constrained ( even when the intrinsic distribution of the relative luminosity distance moduli is ignored ) might probably be due to the lack of low redhsift sources , as it is already known that low redhsift sources are important when employing a grb sample to constrain the cosmological parameters ( see firmani et al .",
    "we thus follow what were done previously ( see ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004a ) to combine an sn ia sample and the xdl sample to constrain the cosmological model .",
    "the sn ia sample employed is that presented in riess et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( the so - called gold set of sn ia ) which contains 157 sources ( where , many low redshifts sources are included ) .",
    "in the same way and for the same reason we apply the minimizing @xmath36 method to the three @xmath0 statistics to find the best fit cosmological parameters .",
    "note that , unlike what is shown in the case of the grb sample , the deduced luminosity distance moduli of the sn  ia sources do not depend on the adopted cosmological parameters .",
    "it is known that , in estimating the deduced luminosity distance moduli of the sn  ia sources , deviations caused by different magnitudes of the peak luminosity of the sources have been checked .",
    "indeed , we find that the distribution of the relative luminosity distance moduli of the sn ia sample is very narrow ( the figure is omitted ) .",
    "this suggests that , if it still exists ( possibly caused by the small deviation from the adopted empirical relation between the light - curve shape and luminosity ) , the intrinsic distribution must be extremely narrow .",
    "thus we ignore the intrinsic distribution of the relative luminosity distance moduli of the sn ia sample , and consider only @xmath77 and @xmath38 for the grb sample when we calculate the corresponding @xmath1 and @xmath80 for the combined sample ( including the xdl grb sample and the gold sn ia sample ) .    shown in fig .",
    "2 are the hubble diagram and the confident contour plot of the combined sample .",
    "one finds that , including the sn ia sample significantly improves the constraint of the ranges of cosmological parameters .",
    "once more , the result shows that taking into account the intrinsic distribution of the relative luminosity distance moduli leads to a poorer constraint .",
    "the effect is still obvious ( although it is less obvious than that adopting the grb sample alone ) and therefore should not be neglected .",
    "the resulting best fit cosmological parameters as well as their @xmath79 errors are listed in table 1 as well .",
    "the effect of the intrinsic distribution of cosmological candles is investigated in this paper . due to fluctuation ,",
    "it is natural that a property ( say , the luminosity ) of sources served as a cosmological candle might form a distribution and scatter around a central value .",
    "if the distribution does exist , the statistic @xmath36 can not be defined since the distribution itself is unclear and the real value of the property for each source is unknown . however , when the distribution is narrow , the deviation of the observed modulus of each source from the central value could be estimated within a ceratin range .",
    "we accordingly define a lower and upper limits of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath81 , to estimate cosmological parameters via the conventional minimizing @xmath0 method .",
    "the confidence contours of these two @xmath0 statistics can then be plotted in the conventional way , and with these curves the ranges of the parameters could be determined as long as a confidence level is assigned .    with this method , a sample bearing a relatively small width of the intrinsic distribution of the deduced relative luminosity distance moduli would be applicable to constraining the cosmological parameters . to illustrate this method we employ a grb sample alone and later",
    "combine this grb sample with the gold sn ia sample , assuming that this grb sample ( the xdl sample ) has an intrinsic distribution of the deduced relative luminosity distance moduli while the sn ia sample has not .",
    "the analysis suggests that : a ) the effect of the intrinsic distribution of the relative luminosity distance moduli is obvious and therefore should not be neglected if the distribution itself does exist ; b ) taking into account this effect would lead to a poorer constraint of the ranges of cosmological parameters .",
    "this indicates that in the attempt of constraining the cosmological model with grb samples , the results tend to be worse than what previously thought if the mentioned intrinsic distribution exists , although the distribution is very narrow .    as revealed recently by wang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , there is a clear evidence for a tight linear correlation between peak luminosities of sn ia and their @xmath82 colors at @xmath83 12 days after the @xmath84 maximum .",
    "they found that this empirical correlation allows one to reduce scatters in estimating their peak luminosities from @xmath83 0.5 mag to the levels of 0.18 and 0.12 mag in the @xmath85 and @xmath86 bands , respectively .",
    "we wonder if taking into account this effect can reduce the measurement uncertainty of the luminosity distance of the sn ia sources .",
    "if so , the ranges of the cosmological parameters might be better constrained ( when compared with fig .",
    "2 ) ( this will be investigated later ) .",
    "as encountered in other cases , our method suffers from possible evolution of candles .",
    "quite recently , firmani et al . (",
    "2004 ) found evidence supporting an evolving luminosity function of long grbs , where the luminosity scales as @xmath87 .",
    "it is unclear if the corrected gamma - ray energy , from which the luminosity distance moduli of the adopted grb sample are deduced , evolves with redshif .",
    "if so , the question if the grb sample can still be used to constrain the cosmological model should be answered .",
    "this deserves a detailed investigation .",
    "( it could be done only when the size of the sample is large enough ) .",
