    "we call a graph _ intrinsically linked _ ( _ intrinsically knotted _ ) if every embedding of that graph into three - space contains a nontrivial link ( knot ) .",
    "intrinsically linked and intrinsically knotted graphs were first studied in the early 1980s by sachs @xcite and by conway and gordon . since then these graphs have been extensively studied .",
    "significant progress has been made in this area , such as the complete classification of minor minimal examples for intrinsically linked graphs by robertson , seymour , and thomas . since this classification",
    "was completed , work has turned to finding graphs whose every embedding contains more complex structures . for example , one could require that every embedding of the graph contain a nonsplit link of @xmath4 components @xcite , or a link with linking number larger than some constant @xcite .",
    "we would now like to combine the two properties of intrinsic linking and intrinsic knotting and ask the following question : does there exist a graph such that any embedding of this graph contains a nonsplit link , where at least one of the components of this link is a nontrivial knot ?",
    "the answer is affirmative , and we demonstrate examples .",
    "* theorem [ mainthm ] * _ every embedding of the graph @xmath6 contains a nonsplit link of two components , where at least one of these two components is a nontrivial knot .",
    "_    this graph contains one hundred and twenty - six vertices , so it is unlikely to be minor minimal .",
    "in fact , it is possible that graphs as small as @xmath7 or @xmath8 have this property , but current techniques do not allow us to detect it .",
    "a graph containing an @xmath4-component link in every embedding was first demonstrated by flapan , foisy , naimi , and pommersheim @xcite .",
    "the link constructed in @xcite has the form of a chain of components , each linked to its neighbors .",
    "a different type of @xmath4-component link , more like a ring of keys where one component links all the others , was found in @xcite .",
    "using this later construction , we can produce a link of arbitrarily many components , some of which are nontrivial knots .",
    "* theorem [ knottedkeys ] * _ given @xmath9 , there exists a graph @xmath0 such that every embedding of @xmath0 contains a nonsplit link of @xmath10 components , where at least @xmath5 of the components are nontrivial knots . _",
    "flapan @xcite and shirai and taniyama @xcite proved that for a given @xmath11 , certain graphs always contain a two component link with linking number greater than or equal to @xmath11 .",
    "this led the author and diesl to study graphs that contained two component links with linking number equal to a multiple of @xmath11 , for @xmath12 @xcite . here",
    "we continue this work and search for links with linking number equal to a multiple of a given integer @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the sequence from @xcite defined as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "then we have the following theorem .    *",
    "theorem [ zeromodn ] * _ given @xmath19 , every embedding of @xmath20 contains a 2-component link @xmath21 with @xmath22 for some @xmath23 .",
    "_    the author and diesl produced the analogous result for the case of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath24 the number of vertices required for the graph in theorem [ zeromodn ] is roughly @xmath26 whereas the bound from @xcite is smaller , roughly @xmath27 .",
    "so , while here we are able to extend the construction to all @xmath4 , this extension comes at a cost .",
    "to prove thoerem [ mainthm ] , we first produce an intrinsically knotted graph @xmath28 and show that a certain pair of edges in this graph are contained in a knotted cycle in any embedding .",
    "this graph @xmath28 is closely related to the graph introduced by foisy in @xcite .",
    "we then take ten copies of @xmath28 and carefully glue them together to produce @xmath6 .",
    "the crucial idea is that any embedding of @xmath6 can be contracted down to a copy of @xmath29 , where every triangle containing a distinguished vertex is the contraction of a knotted cycle .",
    "thus the linked triangles in @xmath29 correspond to a pair of linked cycles in @xmath6 and as one of these triangles contains the distinguished vertex , the corresponding cycle is knotted .",
    "every embedding of the graph @xmath6 contains a nonsplit link of two components , where at least one of these two components is a nontrivial knot .",
    "[ mainthm ]    let @xmath28 be the graph shown in figure [ fgraph ] .",

    "]    we , however , want the edges @xmath30 and @xmath31 to always be contained in a knotted cycle , whatever the embedding of @xmath28 .",
    "this graph contains two disjoint copies of @xmath32 which is intrinsically linked , and in fact each copy always contains a triangle linked with a square . using the edges running between the two copies of @xmath32",
    ", we may contract @xmath28 to the graph shown in figure [ 4cycles ] .",
    "we contract the triangle containing @xmath33 to cycle 1 , and the triangle containing @xmath34 to cycle 2 . because of the edges in the middle of the graph , the triangle containing @xmath33 is adjacent to the square linked with the triangle containing @xmath34 .",
    "contract this square to cycle 2 , and the analogous square in the other copy of @xmath32 to cycle 3 .",
    "this gives us that cycle 1 is linked with cycle 3 , and cycle 4 is linked with cycle 2 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite and @xcite that the graph in figure [ 4cycles ] always contains a knotted cycle , and clearly this knotted cycle must use the edges @xmath30 and @xmath31 . since vertex expansion ( and edge addition ) do not change the isotopy type of a cycle , every embedding of @xmath28 contains a knotted cycle that uses the edges @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "every embedding of @xmath29 contains a pair of linked triangles , and one of these triangles must include the vertex @xmath50 .",
