    "as a result , at such points no fixed lower estimation can be guaranteed , and lacking a uniformly valid pointwise comparision of @xmath134 and @xmath13 , a direct conclusion can not be drawn either .    this explains why the case of the interval @xmath4 already proved to be much more complicated for the integral mean norms .    in a series of papers @xcite",

    "taking @xmath621 root and estimating @xmath622 simply by 2 yields theorem [ th : posdepth ] .",
    "given the results for maximum norm and the above results of theorem [ th : lqcircular ] and theorem [ th : posdepth ] , it is in order to clarify if the linear growth with @xmath5 is indeed the maximal possible order of oscillation in @xmath8 norms .",
    "that is settled by the next result .",
    "let @xmath48 be any compact , connected  not necessarily convex  domain , bounded by a finite or countable number of closed , rectifiable jordan curves @xmath623 ( @xmath624 with finite total arc length @xmath625 .",
    "then for any @xmath174 there exists some polynomial @xmath113 with @xmath626 .",
    "note that the rectifiable assumption is necessary to have finite @xmath8 norms , for otherwise most polynomials have infinite @xmath8 norms on the boundary . however , apart from this assumption , the domain @xmath15 is quite general , including nonconvex , multiply connected domains . for disconnected domains ,",
    "the analysis may be done separately for connected components , and for compact sets without an interior even a lower order of oscillation is possible , as it has been shown at least for the interval @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we may be satisfied with the degree of generality of the above formulated assertion .",
    "we will provide a simple example .",
    "let @xmath627 be any diameter , and chose an endpoint of the diameter @xmath474 .",
    "without loss of generality we may assume that this endpoint is just the origin @xmath73 , and we can as well assume that @xmath628 $ ] . then our polynomial will simply be @xmath629 .    at points , where @xmath630 , we have @xmath631 , and @xmath632 . on the other hand , for points in the ring domain @xmath633 and belonging to @xmath15 we have @xmath634 .",
    "so we can write @xmath635 by construction , the point @xmath103 on the other end of the diameter @xmath474 sits in @xmath291 , and belongs to some of the boundary curves @xmath623 , which boundary curve must have some positive length @xmath636 , say .",

    "it follows that at @xmath643 it holds @xmath644 until @xmath645 , and so we have @xmath646 \\\\ & \\ge \\frac{d\\left [ d^{nq } - ( d-\\lambda)^{nq}\\right]}{nq+1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath647 finally applying this in leads to @xmath648 since @xmath505 and @xmath649 , it suffices to observe that @xmath650 decreases for @xmath651 and thus @xmath652 .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath653 as here the constant depends only on the domain @xmath15 , we conclude that @xmath654 holds for the chosen polynomial @xmath113 , whence the assertion .    in case of a convex domain @xmath15 ,",
    "the parameters occurring here in @xmath655 have a simpler meaning .",
    "first , the boundary @xmath291 is connected ( consists of only one convex curve ) , and thus @xmath656 and @xmath657 .",
    "second , as we have used several times , _ for convex curves _ the estimate @xmath658 holds true , always , whence simplifies to @xmath659 , say .    in @xcite a more precise value of the constant @xmath655",
    "has also been obtained for the case of the infinity norm . as for @xmath8-norm",
    "neither the order ( in general ) , nor the more exact constants are known , it seemed to be well ahead of time to bother with sharper values of the constant @xmath655 here .",
    "nevertheless , our feeling is that the slightly more involved construction of @xcite would indeed provide a better constant , which may be sharp , apart from an absolute constant factor , like in case @xmath157 . here",
    "we do not pursue this issue any more .",
    "above we have seen , that like in case of the maximum norm , also for the @xmath660 norm any compact convex domain @xmath15 admits polynomials @xmath113 with oscillation not exceeding @xmath16 . on the other hand we have shown for some classes of convex domains that the order of oscillation indeed reaches @xmath661 .    a natural question  quite resembling to the question posed by erd 77 years ago in case of the maximum norm  is to identify those domains which indeed admit order @xmath5 oscillation even in @xmath660 norm .    it has been clarified that , like in case of the maximum norm , also for @xmath8 norms the interval @xmath4 behaves differently : there the order of oscillation may be as low as @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it is certainly necessary that _ some _ conditions are assumed for an order @xmath5 oscillation .",
    "the question is if apart from having a nonempty interior , is there need for any additional assumption ?",
    "we think that probably not .    for all compact convex domains @xmath48 there exist @xmath662 such that for any @xmath43 we have @xmath663",
    ".    we are not really close to this conjecture .",
    "let us point out that a general estimate ",
    "however weak  is still missing in the full generality of all convex compact domains .",
    "apart from the cases discussed here , we mentioned that the case of the interval @xmath4 is clarified  there the oscillation being of order @xmath3 .",
    "so clearly also here there is a difference between various compact convex sets .",
    "however , we do not really know if @xmath4 is indeed to be  the worst \" , i.e. of lowest possible oscillation , as for general domains really nothing  not even some mere @xmath664 e.g.has been proved to date .    therefore ,",
    "posing a more modest goal , we would be interested as well _ in any estimate _",
    "working for _ general compact convex domains _ , without further assumptions on the geometrical features of it .",
