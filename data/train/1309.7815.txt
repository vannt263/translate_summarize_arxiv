    "homogeneous as well as heterogeneous crystallization are of importance in materials design and production . but even for one of the most simple models for liquids , the suspension of monodisperse hard spheres ,",
    "the crystallization process is not fully understood @xcite .",
    "+ for the hard sphere system the transition from the supersaturated fluid to the crystal is purely entropic .",
    "it is a first order transition , hence in the case of packing fractions slightly higher than the coexistence packing fraction the system prevails in its meta - stable fluid state for a characteristic induction time before it is transformed irreversibly into a crystal .",
    "+ the idea of the present work is to modify and restrict the possible number of pathways to crystallization in a controlled manner to understand how sensitive the crystallization process and , in particular , the induction time are with respect to changes in configuration space . + the method we employ is to take a configuration of hard spheres and to pin a randomly chosen fraction of them to their current positions . this model is called the random pinning model ( rp ) in the literature .",
    "its diffusive behavior and relaxation properties have already been studied numerically and analytically ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for high pinning concentrations , the relaxation times become large and the dynamic scattering function displays two step relaxation characteristic of glassy dynamics @xcite . +",
    "even though the dynamics change , the configurations correspond to typical equilibrated fluid configurations @xcite .",
    "therefore , static properties , as for example the static structure factor or the pair correlation function do not display any signatures of the restricted number of configurations . + in case the system undergoes the phase transition to the crystal , though , the transition process is modified .",
    "+ recently , computer simulations of the rp model were used to detect signatures of a static length scale associated with the glass transition in systems of hard spheres @xcite and mode coupling theory @xcite .",
    "+ in the present work , the pinning concentrations are kept sufficiently low not to reach the glass transition , because we are interested in crystallizing trajectories .",
    "our study is split in two parts : in the first part we discuss crystallization for static random pinning , i.e.  once the pinned hard spheres are chosen , they stay pinned for the rest of the simulation .",
    "the concentration of pinned hard spheres can directly be translated into a length scale that interferes with the typical size of a critical cluster . in the second part",
    "we alter the selection of pinned hard spheres in time intervals @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 directly interferes with the typical time scale to form a critical cluster . due to the external time scale @xmath0",
