    "systems composed of small particles with sizes of 10 s of nanometers dispersed in solvents are known as colloidal suspensions.@xcite with increasing interest in the properties of complex fluids and their various thermodynamic phases , colloidal systems are a subject of vast experimental and theoretical investigations.@xcite    the two - dimensional ( 2d ) colloids are of special interest for several reasons .",
    "first , colloidal systems can be realized rather easily experimentally , as in air - water interfaces or between two parallel glass plates , and advances in measurement techniques such as digital video microscopy bring about a wealth of information on these systems.@xcite second , the nature of melting of 2d crystals is different than their 3d counterparts , making them a subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigations.@xcite colloidal suspensions in the fluid phase may crystallize as their density increases or the range of interaction changes .",
    "existence of a glassy phase@xcite and re - entrant melting@xcite are examples of various motivating derives behind some of the recent work .",
    "possibilities of photonic band - gap structures made out of colloidal crystals promise interesting applications.@xcite    in this work , we first use the hnc and py approximations for a comparison between the two approaches for the pure hard - core potential ( phcp ) as a model for a colloidal system .",
    "it is well known that the simple hnc approximation , which omits the elementary diagrams , gives a good description of the large interparticle distance behavior . on the other hand , the py approximation yields better results for the short interparticle distances.@xcite in the next step , we employ the widely used hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) approximation to study the liquid state correlation functions and freezing transition of charge - stabilized colloidal particles in two - dimensions interacting via the hard - core yukawa potential ( hcyp ) .",
    "our basic aim is to test how well the hnc method models the static properties of a colloidal system .",
    "similar calculations@xcite in 3d resulted in good agreement between the predictions of hnc theory and monte carlo simulations . to this end",
    ", we calculate the pair - correlation function and the static structure factor for a range of densities and temperatures .",
    "we discuss our results in comparison to other theoretical approaches and available experiments .",
    "in this section , we introduce the model of two - dimensional charged colloidal particles .",
    "we consider the colloidal particles trapped in a surface energy well at an air - water interface modeled by a hard - core and a yukawa interaction.@xcite the pair potential @xmath0 between the colloidal particles is given by @xmath1}}{r } & \\mbox{for $ r>\\sigma$\\ , , } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the strength of the interaction , @xmath3 is the hard - core radius , and @xmath4 is the inverse of the debye screening length of the colloidal system .",
    "phcp without the yukawa tail is obtained by setting @xmath5 .",
    "the form of the interaction potential between charge - stabilized colloids is different from that between charged colloidal particles as inferred from the recent experiments of marcus and rice.@xcite the role of long - range forces in colloidal systems has been emphasized by noro _",
    "et al_.@xcite      given the above potential to describe interactions between charged colloidal particles , the evaluation of correlation functions reduces to a problem in classical liquid state theory@xcite .",
    "one of the basic quantities of interest is the pair - distribution function defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of the liquid .",
    "the pair - distribution function gives the probability of finding a particle at @xmath8 when we fix another particle at @xmath9 .",
    "other relevant quantities are the pair - correlation function @xmath10 , and the static structure factor defined by @xmath11 the pair - correlation function for a simple , isotropic fluid can be decomposed using the ornstein - zernike relation@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is called the direct correlation function and can be related to the structure factor through @xmath14\\ , .\\ ] ] a closure relation between @xmath15 and @xmath13 is needed to supplement the ornstein - zernike relation .",
    "there are some closure relations between @xmath15 and @xmath13 . in the following we use the well - known the hnc and py approximations . in the hnc approximation",
    ", the closure relation takes the form@xcite @xmath16 - 1-y(r)\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the interparticle pair potential and by construction @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the inverse temperature . on another hand ,",
    "the py closure relation is given by@xcite @xmath19 the self - consistent solution of eqs .",
    "( [ oze ] ) ,  ( [ soze ] ) or  ( [ py ] ) gives the information on the correlations in the liquid state within the hnc or py schemes .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our numerical calculation of the hnc and py equations for a system of colloidal particles interacting with hcyp .",
    "we have solved eqs .",
    "( [ oze ] ) ,  ( [ soze ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ py ] ) for hnc and py approximations , respectively",
    ". one can find solutions for these set of equations by numerical iteration taking the potential defined in eq .",
    "( [ hcyp ] ) as input .",
    "we have obtained the correlation functions for a wide range of values of the density @xmath20 , screening length @xmath21 , and inverse temperature @xmath22 .",
    "more specifically , we have calculated the pair - correlation function , the static structure factor , the collective mode energy , and direct correlation function which is related to the effective potential .",
    "we have then used the hansen - verlet@xcite criterion to estimate the phase line for liquid - solid transition .    as a comparison , firstly , we compare the results between the hnc and py approximations . to show the differences , we compare the results for two extreme regions , low and high densities . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the pair - distribution function at @xmath23 within the hnc and py approximations for phcp .",
    "one can see that the differences between two approaches increase by increasing density .",
    "it is evident that we have a sharp peak in @xmath24 and the height of the peak increases as we increase the density .",
    "this means that the probability of finding a particle at @xmath24 when we fix a particle in the origin increases with increasing density .",
    "one can observe the long - range oscillatory behavior in pair - distribution function which is a sign for liquid - solid phase transition .",
    "using eq.([ssf ] ) , one can find the static structure factor .",
    "we depict in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the static structure factor at @xmath23 within the hnc and py approximations for phcp .",
    "there is a peak around @xmath25 which increases with increasing density .",
    "a sharp peak in the structure factor at @xmath25 produces long - range oscillatory behavior with periodicity @xmath3 in the pair - distribution function which is a signature for the long - range order or the solid phase .",
    "furthermore , the height of this peak is very important in predicting of the liquid - solid phase transition .",
    "the hansen - verlet criterion simply states that the phase transition takes place when the value of the first peak in @xmath26 reaches a special constant .",
    "it is interesting that the difference between the value of the static structure factor within the two approximations near the first peak is small .",
    "this small difference allows the use of hnc results to be reasonable to predict the liquid - solid phase transition for phcp .",
    "we used the recent results of weber , marx and binder @xcite for the density at which the phase transition takes place to determine the height of this peak in our results .",
    "this value in our results is about @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath28 within the hnc approximation .",
    "we now report the results for hcyp within the hnc approximation .",
    "the static structure factor is shown in fig.[fig3 ] at fixed @xmath29 and @xmath30 for different values of @xmath31 .",
    "we observe that with increasing density the peak structure in the static structure factor increases .",
    "again , the increasing peak height of static structure factor shows the tendency toward the formation of solid phase .",
    "we also can observe that there is a shift in the position of the peak , which means in the high density regime the hard - core part of the potential is dominant compared to the yukawa part and the position of the peak shifts to the position for the hard - core one .",
    "we observe the same behavior by fixing @xmath21 and @xmath31 , and changing @xmath32 or by fixing @xmath32 and @xmath31 , and changing @xmath21 .",
    "the above argument means that by changing the strength and range of the yukawa part or the temperature , one can reach the phase transition point .",
    "the results at @xmath33 , @xmath34 for different values of @xmath21 and at @xmath35 , @xmath29 for different values @xmath21 are depicted in figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "it is evident from fig.[fig4 ] that the position of the peak is different from the high density limit , which implies , for low density limit the yukawa part has the major contribution in the liquid - solid phase transition .",
    "the position of the peak also has some information about periodicity in pair - distribution function . generally , the position of the peak near the phase transition point for hcyp only depends on the value of the density and it is insensitive to other parameters .    in fig.[fig6 ]",
    "we show the pair - distribution function at fixed @xmath29 , @xmath30 and different values of @xmath31 .",
    "it is interesting to note that we have a shift toward @xmath24 as we increase the density , which again means that the hard - core part has major contribution in the high density limit .",
    "it is clear that the period of the oscillations also changes as the density increases .",
    "it is possible to study the evolution of the first peak in the static structure factor when the physical quantities change , to extract some useful information about liquid - solid phase transition .",
    "we show in fig.[fig7 ] , the variation of this peak in terms of @xmath32 for a set of densities @xmath36 at @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the yukawa part is important only for low density and it is the source of liquid - solid phase transition in the low density region .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath32 at which the phase transition takes place also shifts to the right very rapidly with decreasing density , because the mean distance between two particles increases with reducing density and the effect of the yukawa interaction decreases exponentially as the mean distance increases .    in fig.[fig8",
    "] we show the variation of the first peak in terms of @xmath32 at @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "it is observed that with increasing @xmath21 , the curves @xmath39 are going to tend to a constant , which means that hard - core part again has the major effect on this system in this region and we can thus observe the phase transition with changing density .",
    "from the previous figures and using the hansen - verlet criterion , we can obtain the liquid - solid phase transition line .",
    "we depict in fig.[fig9 ] the phase line for different values of @xmath21 .",
    "it is interesting to note that all phase separation lines tend to the same point in the high density limit , which is reasonable .",
    "another important point is that with increasing @xmath21 the phase line tends to the line @xmath28 .",
    "this line is equivalent to the liquid - solid phase transition line for pure hard - core potential .",
    "the phase diagram of colloidal systems in 2d is of particular recent interest because of the subtleties in freezing or melting transition .",
    "bladon and frankel@xcite using an attractive aquare - well potential found a first order melting transition where the system goes into a liquid phase from a crystal phase . however , molecular dynamics@xcite simulations and recent experiments@xcite show solid - to - hexatic and hexatic - to - liquid phase transitions if there is an attractive part to the colloidal potential . in an earlier work lwen@xcite",
    "did not find a hexatic phase in a yukawa system .",
    "it appears that how the form of the interaction potential influences the possible phases in 2d colloidal systems is not entirely clear .",
    "issues such as attractive or repulsive nature , hard or soft core , and long range part of the potential remain to be systematically investigated . in our analysis , we used the hansen - verlet criterion to determine the liquid - solid freezing transition which seem consistent with available results .    in summary , we have used in this paper the hnc theory to study the correlation functions of a 2d hard - core yukawa fluid as a model for colloidal systems .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the yukawa tail in the model potential by comparing our results with those for purely hard - core potential .",
    "the reliability of our correlation functions at small distances are tested against the py approximation . using the hansen - verlet criterion which uses the value of the first peak in the static structure factor",
    ", we obtained the phase diagram showing the liquid - solid transition .",
