    "the development of self - consistent many - body theories aiming at the description of low - energy nuclear phenomena provides the necessary theoretical tools for an exploration of the nuclear chart into known and unknown regions .",
    "theoretical methods ( both relativistic and non - relativistic ) formulated within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) and effective field theory ( eft ) are the most promising tools for the global investigation of the properties of atomic nuclei .",
    "the dft and eft concepts in nuclear structure models have been extensively discussed in a number of recent articles @xcite .",
    "the power of the models based on these concepts is essentially unchallenged in medium and heavy mass nuclei where ab - initio type few - body calculations are computationally impossible and the applicability of the spherical shell model is restricted to a few regions in the vicinity of doubly shell closures .",
    "the self - consistent mean - field approach to nuclear structure represents an approximate implementation of kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , which is successfully employed in the treatment of the quantum many - body problem in atomic , molecular and condensed matter physics .",
    "the dft enables a description of the nuclear many - body problem in terms of energy density functionals ( edf ) , and self - consistent mean - field models approximate these functionals , which include all higher - order correlations , with powers and gradients of ground - state nucleon densities ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "edf functionals are universal in the sense that they can be applied to nuclei all over the periodic table .",
    "although they model the effective interaction between nucleons , edf are not necessarily related to any nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential . by employing these energy functionals ,",
    "adjusted to reproduce the empirical properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , and bulk properties of some spherical nuclei , the current generation of self - consistent mean - field methods has achieved a high level of accuracy in the description of the ground states and the properties of excited states in arbitrarily heavy nuclei , exotic nuclei far from @xmath0-stability , and in nuclear systems at the nucleon drip - lines ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the self - consistent methods ( such as hartree - fock ( hf ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) ) based on zero range skyrme forces or finite range gogny forces are frequently used in nuclear structure calculations @xcite .",
    "these approaches represent non - relativistic energy density functionals based on the schrodinger equation for many - body nuclear problem @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", one can formulate the class of relativistic models based on the dirac formalism , which can generally be defined as _ covariant density functionals _ ( cdf ) @xcite .",
    "these models , such as quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite , are based on concepts of non - renormalizable effective relativistic field theories and dft , and they provide a very interesting relativistic framework for the studies of nuclear structure phenomena at and far from the valley of @xmath1stability @xcite . relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models @xcite are analogs of the kohn - sham formalism of dft @xcite , with local scalar and vector fields appearing in the role of local relativistic kohn - sham potentials @xcite .",
    "the energy density functional is approximated with the powers and gradients of auxiliary meson fields or nucleon densities .",
    "the eft building of the energy density functional allows error estimates to be made , provides a power counting scheme which separates long- and short - distance dynamics and , therefore , removes model dependences from the self - consistent mean field approach @xcite . in the description of nuclear ground states and the properties of excited states the self - consistent mean - field implementations of quantum hadrodynamics , the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model ( rhb ) and the relativistic ( quasiparticle ) random phase approximation ( rqrpa ) and their subversions ,",

    "the _ mean field _ is a basic concept of every dft .",
    "one can specify _ time - even _ and _ time - odd _ mean fields @xcite dependent on the response of these fields to the action of time - reversal operator .",
    "the properties of time - even mean fields in nuclear density functionals are reasonably well understood and defined @xcite .",
    "this is due to the facts that ( i ) many physical observables such as binding energies , radii etc .",
    "are sensitive only to these fields , and ( ii ) the model parameters are fitted to such physical observables .",
    "on the other hand , the properties of time - odd mean fields , which appear only in nuclear systems with broken time - reversal symmetry , are still poorly understood .",
    "however , it is already known that these fields are important for proper description of rotating nuclei @xcite , band terminations @xcite , magnetic moments @xcite , isoscalar monopole vibrations @xcite , electric giant resonances @xcite , large amplitude collective dynamics @xcite , fussion process @xcite , the strengths and energies of gamow - teller resonances @xcite , the binding energies of odd - mass nuclei @xcite and the additivity of angular momentum alignments @xcite .",
    "they also may play a role in the @xmath2 nuclei @xcite and affect the definition of the strength of pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "there was a dedicated effort to better understand time - odd mean fields in the framework of the skyrme energy density functional ( edf ) theory ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . on the contrary ,",
    "much less attention has been paid to these fields in covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that time - odd mean fields are defined through the lorentz invariance in the cdft @xcite , and thus they do not require additional coupling constants . on the other hand , time - odd mean fields are not well defined in non - relativistic density functional theories @xcite and , as a consequence , there are a number of open questions related to these fields .",
    "the current manuscript aims at better and systematic understanding of time - odd mean fields and their impact on physical observables in non - rotating nuclei in the framework of the rmf realization of the cdft .",

    "the polarization effects induced by nm and the energy splitting between blocked state and its unoccupied signature partner induced by nm decrease with the increase of mass ( compare tables [ nm - odd ] and [ nm - odd-3 ] below ) .",

    "it was also checked on some examples that additional binding due to nm only weakly depends on the parametrization of the rmf lagrangian .",

    "for example , the binding energy modifications due to time - odd mean fields will be larger for the configuration based on blocked single - particle state with small @xmath90 than for the configuration with large @xmath90 of the blocked state if both blocked states belong to the same @xmath92-shell . on the contrary , the rmf calculations do not reveal this type of correlations between additional binding due to nm and the structure of the blocked state .",
    "indeed , the configurations which have the largest changes in binding energies due to nm ( @xmath93 mev ) are [ 413]5/2 , [ 404]7/2 , [ 640]1/2 , [ 631]3/2 , [ 505]9/2 and [ 501]1/2 .                  when discussing current distributions , it is important to remember that the calculations are performed in one - dimensional cranking approximation .",
    "although the rotational frequency is equal to zero in the calculations , the results for the currents still obey the symmetries imposed by the cranking approximation .",

    "this energy gap is about 2 mev in the skyrme edf calculations with the sly4 force @xcite , while it is much smaller being around 0.45 mev in the crmf calculations with the nl1 , nl3 and nlsh parametrizations .",
    "the energies of the @xmath156 states are not affected by time - odd mean fields in the skyrme edf calculations @xcite , while appreciable additional binding is generated by nm for these states in the crmf calculations ( fig .",
    "[ multi ] ) .    figs .",
    "[ odd - odd - al ] and [ odd - odd - cl ] show the results of the calculations for ground state configurations in odd - odd al and cl nuclei .",
    "the calculations suggest that signature separation due to time - odd mean fields is also expected in the configurations of odd - odd nuclei located at zero or low excitation energies .",
    "the signature separation is especially pronounced in the @xmath2 @xmath209al ( the @xmath1665/2 \\otimes \\nu [ 202]5/2 $ ] configuration ) and @xmath154cl nuclei .",
    "this is because proton and neutron currents in these configurations are almost the same both in strength and in spatial distribution . as a result ,",
    "their contribution to the total energy is large when these currents are in the same direction ( the @xmath156 configurations ) and close to zero when these currents are in opposite directions ( the @xmath155 configurations ) .",
    "note that @xmath209al is axially deformed while @xmath154cl is triaxially deformed with @xmath210 .",
    "however , both of them show the enhancement of the signature separation at @xmath2 .",
    "the signature separation is rather small for the majority of nuclei away from the @xmath2 line .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the strength of the currents in one subsystem ( and thus the impact of nm on binding energies ) is much stronger than in another subsystem . as a result",
    ", there is no big difference ( large signature separation ) between the cases in which proton and neutron currents are in the same and opposite directions .",
    "however , some nuclei away from the @xmath2 line also show appreciable signature separation . these are @xmath211al and @xmath212cl nuclei ( figs .",
    "[ odd - odd - al ] , [ odd - odd - cl ] ) for which the strengths of proton and neutron currents ( but not necessarily the spatial distribution of the currents ) are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the effects of time - odd mean fields are enhanced at the @xmath2 line",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ nznz ] clearly shows that the enhancement of signature separation is not restricted to the @xmath2 line . indeed ,",
    "signature separation of the configurations based on the same combination of blocked proton and neutron states are very similar in the @xmath2 and @xmath213 nuclei despite the fact that the deformations of compared nuclei differ sometimes appreciably .",
    "there are considerable signature separation in the configurations based on the same blocked proton and neutron states in the @xmath2 and @xmath201 nuclei ( fig .",
    "[ nznz]b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "almost no signature splitting is observed in the @xmath2 and @xmath202 nuclei when the configurations are based on different blocked proton and neutron states ( fig .",
    "[ nznz]a ) .",
    "this suggests that the enhancement of signature splitting is due to similar proton and neutron current distributions ( see discussion in previous paragraph ) .",
    "when considering odd - odd nuclei one has to keep in mind that the present approach takes into account only the part of correlations between blocked proton and neutron and neglects the pairing .",
    "in particular , the residual interaction of unpaired proton and neutron leading to the gallagher - moshkowski doublets of two - quasiparticle states with @xmath214 and @xmath215 @xcite is not taken into account .",
    "thus , future development of the model is required in order to compare directly the experimental data on odd - odd nuclei with calculations .",
    "this question will be discussed in more details in a forthcoming manuscript @xcite .",
    "time - odd mean fields ( nuclear magnetism ) have been studied at no rotation in a systematic way within the framework of covariant density functional theory by performing the blocking of the single - particle states with fixed signature .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * in odd - mass nuclei , nuclear magnetism always leads to an additional binding indicating its attractive nature in the cdft .",
    "this additional binding only weakly depends on the parametrization of the rmf lagrangian . on the contrary",
    ", time - odd mean fields in skyrme edf can be attractive and repulsive and show considerable dependence on the parametrization of density functional .",
    "this additional binding is larger in odd - neutron states than in odd - proton ones in the cdft framework .",
    "the underlying microscopic mechanism of additional binding due to nm has been studied in detail .",
    "the perturbative results clearly indicate that additional binding due nm is defined mainly by time - odd fields and that the polarization effects in fermionic and mesonic sectors of the model cancel each other to a large degree . *",
    "additional binding due to nm can have a profound effect on the properties of odd - proton nuclei in the ground and excited states in the vicinity of the proton - drip line .",
    "in some cases it can transform the nucleus which is proton unbound ( in the calculations without nm ) into the nucleus which is proton bound .",
    "this additional binding can significantly affect the decay properties of proton unbound nuclei by ( i ) increasing the half - lives of proton emitters ( by many orders of magnitude in light nuclei ) or ( ii ) moving the @xmath216 value inside or outside the @xmath216 window favorable for experimental observation of proton emission .",
    "* relative energies of different ( quasi)particle states in medium and heavy mass nuclei are only weakly affected by time - odd mean fields .",
    "this is because additional bindings due to nm show little dependence on blocked single - particle state . as a result",
    ", the present investigation suggests that time - odd mean fields can be neglected in the fits of covariant density functionals aimed at accurate description of the energies of the single - particle states .",
    "* the phenomenon of signature separation @xcite and its microscopic mechanism have been investigated in detail .",
    "it was shown that this phenomenon is active also in the configurations of odd - odd nuclei .",
    "it is enhanced for configurations having the same blocked proton and neutron states ; this takes place either at ground state or at low excitation energy in the nuclei at or close to the @xmath2 line . some configurations away from the @xmath2 line",
    "also show this effect but signature separation is appreciably smaller .",
    "the present investigation has been focused on the study of time - odd mean fields in the cdft with non - linear parametrizations of the lagrangian .",
    "point coupling @xcite and density dependent meson - nucleon coupling @xcite models are other classes of the cdf theories .",
    "it is important to compare them in order to make significant progress toward a better understanding of time - odd mean fields .",
    "the work in this direction is in progress , and the results will be presented in a forthcoming manuscript @xcite .",
