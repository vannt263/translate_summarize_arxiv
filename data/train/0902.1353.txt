    "while laser cooling with near resonant light narrows down atomic momentum distribution , forced evaporation on trapped atoms favors spatial confinement into the quantum degenerate regime . since the first successful experiment on atomic bose - einstein condensation , or the controlled production of many bosonic atoms into the same quantum ground state of a trapping potential , the field of atomic quantum gases has blossomed into one of the leading frontiers in physics , attracting ever increasing interest",
    "the ultimate goal along this line of thought is to control the state of an arbitrary assembly of an interacting many body system , and either use it to simulate other physical systems or to perform quantum computations .",
    "significant efforts have been directed toward the above ambitious goal , with the immediate pursuit from more recent endeavors targeted at the generation , control , and study of cold molecules .",
    "these endeavors include important successes such as the bcs to bec cross - over due to tunable interactions induced through b - field magnetic feshbach resonances and the production of quantum degenerate heteronuclear molecules in specific low lying ro - vibrational states of their electronic ground states @xcite .",
    "the latter advance is especially illuminating , highlighting the prospects for observing and utilizing anisotropic and long range interactions from the permanent electric dipoles .",
    "molecule quantum fluids bring in new possibilities due to their richer internal degrees of freedom , such as alignment and rotation @xcite , even after their hyperfine spins like those of atomic spinor quantum gases are neglected . in this short note",
    ", we propose a simple mechanism to generate a vortex state , relying on the internal degrees of freedom of a heternuclear molecule , through adiabatically flipping the axial bias of an external e - field ioffe - pritchard trap ( ipt ) @xcite .",
    "the physics of our proposal can be analogously mapped onto the successful protocol first proposed @xcite and demonstrated for magnetically trapped atomic condensates @xcite .",
    "our theory hopefully will lead to parallel experiments that begin to address new opportunities afforded by the molecular internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe our model for dc e - field trapping of cold heteronuclear molecules based on the interaction between their permanent electric dipoles with a spatially varying static e - field ipt .",
    "this is analogous to the operation of the famous ipt for magnetic dipoles with an inhomogeneous b - field @xcite .",
    "the heteronuclear diatomic molecule is modeled as a 3d rigid rotor @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the eigen structure of a heteronuclear molecule inside a dc e - field and identify states capable of trapped by a local e - field minimum and their associated quantum numbers .",
    "next , the rotational properties of such eigen states are studied , which helps to illustrate the proposed vortex pump mechanism based on the flipping of the axial bias e - field @xcite .",
    "finally we conclude .",
    "it is imperative to present this study because this analogy between e - field and b - field and between molecular e - dipole and atomic b - dipole is not a simple one to one map .",
    "the magnetic dipole of an atom contains both an electronic and a nuclear component , respectively , proportional to the electronic spin ( @xmath0 ) and the nuclear spin ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "its projection onto the local b - field is approximately proportional to the projection of its hyperfine spin @xmath2 when the b - field is weak .",
    "in contrast , the molecular dipole is a fixed constant and pointed along the molecule axis connecting the two nuclei .",
    "the internal rotational angular momentum of the molecule stays in the perpendicular plane of the molecule axis in the absence of an e - field . despite these differences",
    ", our study finds that the isoshima , _ et al .",
    "_ , protocol @xcite , originally developed for b - field trapped atoms or molecules , remains effective for heteronuclear molecules in a e - field ipt .",
    "much of these comparative studies and analogies will become clear from the materials presented in the third and fourth sections .",
    "we consider a diatomic molecule composed of two different atomic nuclei and described in terms of their center of mass @xmath3 and relative coordinate @xmath4 . neglecting the nuclear and electronic spins and their associated interactions , or assume we consider an eigen state of the above internal degrees of freedom , the remaining hamiltonian reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the inhomogeneous static e - field , which is slowly varying over the molecule size of @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the permanent electric dipole moment operator for this specific electronic and internal spin eigen - state @xcite . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the total and the reduced mass of the two atoms making up the molecule .",

    "i.e. _ , free space e - field traps analogous to the b - field ipt can be constructed .",

    "the strong field seeking states with @xmath26 can not be used to spatially confine molecules with static fields , because it is impossible to construct a local e - field maximum .    the significant progress gained over the years in trapping and manipulating neutral atoms with static b - fields @xcite provide important enabling technologies for the experimental successes of cold atom physics research .",

    "trapped atomic spinor condensates @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will confirm numerically the vortex creation protocol for a condensate of heteronuclear molecules in an e - field ipt .",
    "basically , we will simulate the axial e - field bias flip and check for the adiabatic conditions of the associated internal state .",
    "there are two main points we need to watch for .",
    "first we need to create the proper vortical phase structure on a condensate during the time evolution of the e - field .",
    "secondly we must maintain adiabaticity during the flip of the internal state of a polar molecule .",

    "since @xmath23 is a conserved quantity , this eigen state @xmath72 can be expanded by a series of @xmath18 in @xmath73 , @xmath74 the flipping of the e - field bias adiabatically corresponds then to nothing but a rotation of the initial state along the unit vector @xmath75 in the transverse plane by an angle of @xmath76 . according to the rotation properties we discussed before , this flipping of the bias then gives @xmath77|j ,- m_j\\rangle ,    \\label{rotpsimj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gains clearly a vortex with a winding number @xmath78 .",
    "turning to the second question concerning the adiabaticity , we simply can propagate the initial wave function @xmath35 in real time , simulating the complete process of the bias flip . to test the level of adiabaticity and the validity of eq .",
    "( [ rotpsimj ] ) , we consider points @xmath79 along a circle in the @xmath80-@xmath81 plane .",
    "the absolute value for the e - field along the circle is then a constant , although their local directions are all different . in fact , for the e - field ipt being considered here , the e - field can be written as @xmath82 with @xmath83 a constant . choosing the weak field seeking state @xmath84 with @xmath28 at @xmath85 as considered in fig .",

    "the adiabaticity is found to be fully satisfied , and the state overlap is essentially 100% except for the extra topological phase gained as shown in fig .",
    "a numerical fit gives precisely the slope for the phase over @xmath66 being exactly equal to @xmath95 , which confirms the high fidelity operation of our vortex pump proposal .    before concluding , we point out that , like the system of magnetically trapped atomic spinors inside a b - field ipt @xcite , the quantity of @xmath96 is found to commute with the hamiltonian @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the spatial gradient of the e - field ipt , and @xmath99 is the mechanical angular momentum of the heteronuclear molecule .",
    "@xmath100 is the rotational angular momentum of the molecule .",
    "if the flip of the e - bias is indeed adiabatic , the respective quantum numbers conserve the combination @xmath101 . after going through the flip",
    ", the internal rotational state is changed from @xmath23 to @xmath102 , which then must be accompanied by an increase of @xmath103 to its mechanical angular momentum .",
    "thus we see the appearance of a vortex state .",
    "in conclusion , by analogy with b - field trapping of neutral atoms with magnetic dipoles , we study and identify weak field trapping states of polar molecules inside a spatially inhomogeneous dc e - field .",
    "further , we suggest that an effective and efficient vortex pump protocol can be envisioned for condensates of polar molecules @xcite , based on the flipping of the axial bias field , originally suggested @xcite and experimentally demonstrated for atomic spinor condensates inside a b - field ipt @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed that the e - field bias flip remains effective , and the vortex state created maintains a vorticity proportional to the @xmath23 quantum number of the trapped molecule state .",
    "when a diatomic molecule is placed inside a homogeneous e - field , @xmath23 is a good quantum number .",
    "the weak field trapping states can be associated with very large values of @xmath23 , thus the amount of vorticity created could become very significant even after a single bias flip .",
    "this vorticity possibly could open up a practical approach to reach the rapid rotation limit of atomic / molecular quantum gases .    more generally , we find that this protocol for vortex creation remains effective if the diatomic molecule is taken as a symmetric top @xcite .",
    "interestingly we find the e - bias flip also works for the strong field trapping states provided the polar molecules are confined through other means not relying on its permanent electric dipole .",
    "finally , other improvements to the b - field bias flip protocol @xcite , such as those developed for cyclically operated continuous vortex pumping schemes can be analogously extended to the case of heteronuclear molecules @xcite .",
