    "today , adhesively bonded and coated aluminum structures find a range of technological applications . understanding the factors affecting the adhesion properties of oxide covered aluminum surfaces is important for controlling the long term performance and durability of these structures .",
    "one such factor is the nature and strength of the interfacial bonds between the resins of the adhesive or coating and the substrate . despite their technological relevance ,",
    "the understanding of metal oxide surfaces in general is at a far less advanced level than most other solid surfaces .",
    "experimental studies face complications in preparing the nearly perfect , clean surfaces needed for atomic scale surface investigations , and by the sheer complexity of the crystal and electronic structures .",
    "theoretical studies have been impeded by the limited experimental data available for guidelines and the complexity of the oxide structures .    in this paper",
    "we present a theoretical investigation of methanol ( ch@xmath2oh ) adsorption on clean @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) . the choice of methanol and @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 )",
    "is motivated by the desire to contribute to a more fundamental understanding of adhesion of organic coatings or adhesives at oxide - covered aluminum surfaces .",
    "because of the size and chemical complexity of the binders found in coatings and adhesives , the interpretation of the adhesion mechanism can be difficult .",
    "one strategy to simplify the analysis is to study the interaction of smaller molecules ( representative of the various components of the binder ) with the surface.@xcite following this approach , we will address the binding properties of the different functional groups separately .",
    "methanol is a good starting point for such studies as it is the smallest organic molecule with a hydroxyl group , and because it is well characterized both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite in addition to the thermodynamically stable @xmath0 phase , alumina ( al@xmath1o@xmath2 ) has a number of metastable bulk phases ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8,@xmath9 ) , some being stable up to rather high temperatures . unlike most of the metastable aluminas ( the exceptions are the @xmath7 and @xmath8 phases ) , the atomic structure of @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2 and its ( 0001 ) surface is agreed upon,@xcite and therefore represents an ideal starting point for theoretical studies of adsorption on alumina surfaces .",
    "the adsorption of methanol has been studied experimentally and theoretically on a range of metal oxides , e.g. , cr@xmath1o@xmath2 , zro@xmath1 , and tio@xmath1 , but to our knowledge only one theoretical@xcite and few experimental@xcite investigations of methanol adsorption on al@xmath1o@xmath2 have appeared in the literature .",
    "water , which also has an oh - group , has been shown@xcite to adsorb both as a molecule and dissociatively on @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study both molecular and dissociative adsorption of methanol . in the present study our focus is on molecular adsorption on the clean and perfect ( no steps or defects ) ( 0001)-surface of @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the effect of preadsorbed hydroxyl groups and the dissociative methanol adsorption will be subject of a future study .",
    "bulk @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2 has the corundum structure with alternating o and al layers along the [ 0001 ] direction with stacking sequence @xmath10al  o@xmath2al  al  o@xmath2al@xmath10 . the ( 0001 ) surface is obtained by cleaving the crystal between any of these layers .",
    "only the surface obtained by cleaving between two aluminum layers is non - polar .",
    "previous studies@xcite have shown that in the absence of hydrogen and adsorbed h@xmath1o this aluminum - terminated surface is more stable than the other ( 0001 ) surfaces .",
    "figure  [ metads ] shows a schematic top view of the aluminum terminated @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) surface .",
    "we here use first - principles , plane - wave density - functional theory@xcite ( dft ) to determine the adsorption ( binding ) energy and the equilibrium structure of methanol on @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) .",
    "the merit of first - principles calculations is that no experimental input is needed for an accurate determination of structural energies .",
    "we can thus compare calculations based entirely on theory with experimental findings .",
    "the dft calculations were performed by employing the dacapo code@xcite in the generalized gradient approximation , using ultra - soft pseudopotentials and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the surface is represented by a slab of finite thickness ( 8.3  ) alternating with a vacuum region ( 14.7  ) .",
    "the equilibrium geometries of the methanol molecule , the clean surface , and the adsorbate system are found by locally minimizing the hellmann - feynman forces until the sum of forces on the unrestrained atoms is less than 0.05 ev /  . by adsorbing methanol on one side of the slab only an artificial dipole",
    "is created .",
    "this artificial dipole is corrected for in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the optimized geometry of the isolated ( gas phase ) methanol molecule is in excellent agreement with experiments , with bond lengths and bond angles deviating from the experimental values@xcite by @xmath11  1  % . the most important bond angle and lengths for the present study",
    "are given in table  [ tab : geometri ] .",
    "upon optimization of the clean @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) atomic structure , the inter - plane spacing is relaxed from the bulk spacing .",
    "the distance between the adjacent outermost aluminum and oxygen layer is reduced by 87.2  % , in good agreement with previous theoretical work.@xcite",
    "in our calculations we allow for molecular adsorption of one methanol molecule per surface unit cell ( fig .  [ metads ] ) , or one molecule per exposed al atom .",
    "methanol adsorbs by the transfer of electronic charge from the o atom of methanol to create a bond to the exposed al atom . upon the adsorption of methanol , the layer spacing of @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) changes markedly .",
    "we find that the spacing between the top al and o layers changes from 0.11  to 0.33  , whereas the lateral change of bond length between the surface o atoms and the surface al atoms is small ( 15% ) .",
    "the changes in bond lengths within the adsorbed methanol molecule are modest ( 14 % ) .",
    "the bond lengths of methanol in the gas phase and as adsorbed on the alumina surface are listed in table  [ tab : geometri ] .",
    "the adsorption energy per methanol molecule is calculated from @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total energy of the system per unit cell , @xmath14 is the energy for the clean aluminum oxide surface per unit cell , and @xmath15 is the energy of a methanol molecule away from the surface .",
    "we calculate two adsorption energies for methanol , one for moving the methanol molecules from the surface all the way into the gas phase ( @xmath16 ) , and one for moving a complete layer of methanol structurally unchanged off the surface ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the latter is dominated by the strength of the al - o@xmath18 bond ( ` m ' labels atoms in the molecule ) , and can very accurately be calculated by present - day dft approximations .",
    "the @xmath15 adsorption energy includes energetic contributions from the structural changes within the molecule , as well as interactions between the methanol molecules ( adsorbate - adsorbate interactions ) .",
    "we can compare our calculated adsorption energies with those of experimental measurements .",
    "however , for all results of the experiments it should be kept in mind that the chemisorption of methanol on al@xmath1o@xmath2 is very sensitive to surface defects and the presence of adsorbed water or hydrogen on the surface .",
    "in contrast , in our calculations we investigate a perfect ( no defects or steps ) clean @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) surface . from our dft calculations",
    "we find that the energy of the al - o@xmath18 bond is @xmath4 ev / molecule ( @xmath19 kcal / mol ) and that @xmath20 ev / molecule ( @xmath21 kcal / mol ) , the small difference of 0.02 ev / molecule indicating the calculated effect of the molecule - molecule interactions and the structural changes in the methanol molecule .",
    "given the difficulty in carrying out experimental measurements on methanol adsorption on clean alumina surfaces , these theoretically obtained adsorption energies agree reasonably well with the value 0.77 ev / molecule ( @xmath22 kcal / mol ) obtained from temperature programmed desorption experiments@xcite at low coverages . in an uhv - chemisorption experiment on thin @xmath0- and @xmath5-al@xmath1o@xmath2 films at low coverage an adsorption energy @xmath11 0.3 ev / molecule ( 7  kcal / mol ) was found.@xcite    figure  [ chd ] shows a contour plot of a cross section of the electron density difference @xmath23 in a slice approximately through the outermost al and o atoms of the surface and the o and ( hydroxyl - group ) h atoms of the adsorbed methanol .",
    "@xmath23 measures how electron charge is moved in space due to the adsorbate - surface interaction . the electron density difference is defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron density of the full adsorbate system , @xmath26 is the electron density of the surface without methanol , and @xmath27 is that of methanol without the surface .",
    "the atomic positions are in all cases keep fixed as for the full adsorbate system , thus @xmath23 shows the change in electron density exclusively due to the presence of the adsorbate .",
    "whereas an al atom in the bulk of @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2 is sixfold coordinated , the surface al atom ( al@xmath28 ) on the al - terminated ( 0001 ) surface is only three - fold coordinated , making this site a strong electron acceptor . when methanol adsorbs , the o atom of methanol ( o@xmath18 ) binds to al@xmath28 by donating electron density to creation of the al@xmath28-o@xmath18 bond , forming a dative ( covalent ) bond .",
    "this is seen in figure  [ chd ] as an increase in electron density on the axis directed along the al@xmath28-o@xmath18 bond and a depletion of electron density at o@xmath18 . calculating the electron transfer from the electron density difference",
    "@xmath23 we find that roughly 0.05 electrons are transferred to the al@xmath28-o@xmath18 bond from the lone - pair electrons on o@xmath18 .",
    "it is worth noting that the adsorption energy found here for methanol is very similar to the adsorption energy for water on @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) .",
    "hass et al.@xcite obtained a molecular adsorption energy of 1.01 ev / molecule ( 23.3 kcal / mol ) in the low - coverage regime by dft calculations , as well as the bond lengths reproduced in table  [ tab : geometri ] .",
    "the similarity between water and methanol molecular adsorption is not too surprising .",
    "the parts of methanol taking an active part in the binding to the surface are the o@xmath18 and h@xmath18 atoms of the hydroxyl group , similar to the oh group of adsorbed water .",
    "we have performed first - principles density - functional theory calculations on the molecular adsorption of methanol at the @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) surface . with one methanol molecule adsorbed per surface aluminum atom",
    "the adsorption energy is calculated to be @xmath29 ev / molecule . with molecule - molecule interactions taken into account ,",
    "the adsorption energy is slightly less , @xmath4 ev / molecule .",
    "an electron density difference plot shows that methanol adsorbs by donating electron charge from the methanol oxygen to create a bond to the surface aluminum . upon adsorption of methanol , the surface atomic structure changes .",
    "most notably , the spacing between the top al and o layers change from 0.11  to 0.33  .",
    "we thank c.  ruberto for providing data facilitating the @xmath0-al@xmath1o@xmath2(0001 ) calculations . this work has been done in _ light metal surface science _ a joint project between sintef and ntnu , financed by the norwegian research council , hydro aluminium , profillakkering as , norsk industrilakkering as , noral as , jotun powder coating as , electro vacuum as , dupont powder coatings and gsb .",
