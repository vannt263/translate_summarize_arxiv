    "this system is such that if it can be controlled in the specified way by a given pair @xmath26 , this will also be true for almost all pairs @xmath26 ( except for a set of measure zero ) @xcite . in other words , sc is necessary and sufficient for full control of a system governed by eq .",

    "sc is a mathematical formalization of the idea that a node can fully manipulate only one of its successor elements at a time and that a directed cycle is inherently self - regulatory .",
    "a consequence of this is that the driver nodes are such that every network node is either part of a set of non - intersecting linear chains of nodes that begin at the driver nodes or is part of a set of directed cycle that do not intersect each other or the set of linear chains ( fig .",

    "ruths showed @xcite , this implies that there are three types of network nodes that must be directly manipulated by a unique driver node , and which we call sc nodes : ( i ) every source node , and every successor node of a dilation ( when a node has more than one successor node ) that is not part of the set of linear chains or of the cycles , namely ( ii ) the surplus of sink nodes with respect to source nodes or ( iii ) internal dilation nodes .",
    "an alternative structure - based control method for networks that lack source nodes was developed by fiedler , mochizuki et al .",
    "@xcite . this method is a mathematical formalization of the following idea : in order to drive the state of a source - less network to any one of its dynamical attractors one needs to manipulate a set of nodes that intersects every feedback loop in the network - the feedback vertex set ( fvs ) .",
    "this requirement encodes the importance of feedback loops in determining the dynamical attractors of the network , a fact that was recognized early on in the study of the dynamics of biological networks @xcite .",

    "guarantees that we can guide it from any initial state to any of its dynamical attractors ( i.e. , its natural long term dynamic behavior ) regardless of the specific form of the functions @xmath11 and @xmath14 . in the following we refer to this attractor - based control method as feedback vertex set control ( fc ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : controlfigure]b ) , and to the group of nodes that need be manipulated in feedback vertex set control as a fc node set .",

    "sc was applied to diverse types of real networks and the ratio of the minimal number of sc nodes needed , @xmath28 , and the total number of nodes , @xmath29 was used to gauge how difficult it is to control these networks @xcite . both sc and fc",
    "can be used to answer the question of how difficult to control a network is ( albeit each focuses on a different aspect of control , full control or attractor control ) , so a natural question is how the fraction of control nodes in real networks compares between sc and fc ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the size of the minimal fc control set ) . to answer this question ,",

    "a surprising result is that the fraction of control nodes @xmath32 and @xmath33 appears to be inversely related across several types of networks .",

    "a similar @xmath34 relationship is also seen in food web networks and internet networks , while the opposite relationship ( @xmath35 ) is seen in the social trust networks with low @xmath32 and intra - organizational networks . on further reflection , fc s prediction that gene regulatory networks are easier to control than social trust / communication networks",
    "is supported by recent experimental results in cellular reprogramming and large - scale social network experiments @xcite .    to explain the topological properties underlying the difference in @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", we note that the fraction of nodes @xmath32 and @xmath33 obey the relations @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fraction of source nodes , @xmath38 is the fraction of external dilations nodes in sc , @xmath39 is the fraction of internal dilation nodes in sc , and @xmath40 is the fraction of nodes in the fvs of the network .",
    "empirical directed networks tend to have a bow - tie structure @xcite , in which most of the network belongs to the largest strongly connected component ( which contains most cycles in the network , and thus determines @xmath40 ) , its in - component ( the nodes that can reach the strongly connected component , which thus determine @xmath37 ) , or its out - component ( the nodes that can be reached from the strongly connected component , which thus determine @xmath38 ) .",

    "[ eq:4]-[eq:5 ] and the bow - tie structure of real networks offer a topological explanation for the observed relationships between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .        applying this reasoning to the studied real networks ( [ tab : stable2 ] ) , we find that all networks with @xmath43 have a topology dominated by their scc component ( @xmath44 , fig . [",

    "[ fig : fvsvssc ] , pink shading ; e.g. metabolic networks and circuits ) .",
    "the rest of the networks have a mixed profile ( @xmath48 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsvssc ] , no shading ) , and include networks with @xmath45 ( citation networks and the texas power grid ) and the networks in which @xmath49 ( a political blog network and two online social communication networks ) .    motivated by the observed remarkable agreement between the number of sc nodes @xmath32 of real networks and their degree - preserving randomized versions @xcite , we study fc control in similarly randomized real networks ( [ tab : stable2 ] and ) .",
    "we find much weaker agreement : for most networks the number of fc control nodes is higher than the number of control nodes in randomized versions ( @xmath50 ) ( fig . [",
    "fig : fvsrandom]c ) .",
    "a closer look reveals that the cycle structure of the real networks is responsible for the underestimation of @xmath33 .",
    "although the size of the largest scc is similar or smaller compared to their degree - preserving randomized counterparts , real networks tend to have a more complicated cycle structure , evidenced by the over - representation of cycles compared to the randomized networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsrandom]d ) , and reflected by the larger size of their fvs ( [ tab : stable2 ] ) .",
    "a subset of networks , which includes food webs and citation networks , features fewer cycles than randomized networks and a smaller scc than randomized networks , leading to @xmath51 ( [ tab : stable2 ] ) . similarly to the case of sc , full randomization , which turns the network into an erds - rnyi directed network @xcite , shows little correlation between @xmath33 in randomized networks and real networks ( [ fig : fvser ] , [ tab : stable2 ] , and ) .",
    "validated dynamic models can be an excellent testing ground to assess control methods @xcite . here",
    "we use two models for the gene regulatory network underlying the segmentation of the fruit fly ( _ drosophila melanogaster _ ) during embryonic development : a differential equation model by von dassow et al .",
    "@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dynmod]a ) and a discrete ( boolean ) model by albert and othmer @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dynmod]b ) .",
    "both models consider a group of four subsequent cells as a repeating unit , include intracellular and intercellular interactions among proteins and mrnas , and both recapitulate the observed ( wild type ) pattern of gene expression ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dynmod]a - c and ) .",
    "using sc and fc on these network models , we find @xmath52 ( 4 ) and @xmath53 ( 14 ) for the differential equation ( discrete ) model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dynmod]a - c , [ fig : sfig2 ] , and ) . both model networks are dominated by @xmath54 ( 0.66 and 0.71 , respectively ) , similarly to the brown - shaded networks in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsvssc ] . for sc , the appropriate driver signal @xmath25 needs to be determined for each initial condition using , for example , minimum - energy control @xcite or optimal control @xcite . for fc , locking the fc nodes in their trajectory in the wild type attractor successfully steers the system to the wild type attractor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dynmod]d - e , [ fig : sfig3]-[fig : sfig5 ] , and ) .",
    "thus , fc gives a control intervention which is directly applicable to dynamic models and which is directly linked to their natural long - term behavior .",
    "we emphasize that a control intervention for a real biological system would involve combining fc or sc with a closed - loop control approach because of the inherently approximate nature of any model @xcite .",
    "a subset of the fc node set is often sufficient for a given model and an attractor of interest @xcite . for the fruit fly gene regulatory models we show that 16 ( 12 ) nodes are sufficient for the continuous ( discrete ) model , respectively , which is a 66% ( 14% ) reduction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dynmod]a - c , [ fig : sfig3]-[fig : sfig5 ] , and ) .",
    "this shows that fc provides a benchmark for attractor control node sets that are model independent , as well as an upper limit to model dependent control sets .",
    "thus fc can be used as a gauge for the large body of recent control methods that require a dynamic model to be used @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", sc provides no analogue to this .",
    "network control methods have the general objective of identifying network elements that can manipulate a system given a specified goal and a set of constraints . yet , as we demonstrate using sc and fc , the definition of control ( e.g. full control or attractor control ) and the dynamics of the system ( linear or non - linear ) can have a significant impact on what these network elements are and how many of them are needed .    sc and fc answer complementary aspects of control in a complex network ; which one to use depends on the specific question being asked and on what the natural definition of control is in the system or discipline of interest . we argue that attractor - based control ( and , thus , fc ) is often the natural choice of control for systems in which the use of dynamic models is well established @xcite , particularly in biological networks , in which dynamic models have a long history and an ever - increasing predictive power @xcite . as we showed in this work ,",
    "fc is directly applicable to systems in which only structural information is known , and also to systems in which a parameterized dynamic model is available , for which it provides realizable control strategies that are robust to changes in the parameters and functions .",
    "fc also provides a benchmark and a point of contact with the large body of work in control methods that require the network structure and a dynamic model @xcite . to our knowledge , something similar is not the case for sc , which instead has the advantage of being a well - developed concept in control and systems theory with connections to other notions of control in linear and nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "further work is needed to extend fc and address questions such as the level of control provided by a subset of nodes and the difficulty of steering the system towards a desired state ( control energy ) , concepts which are well - developed in control theory approaches @xcite . taken together",

    "this will also be true for almost all pairs @xmath26 ( except for a set of measure zero ) @xcite .",
    "in other words , sc is necessary and sufficient for control of almost all linear time - invariant systems consistent with the network structure in @xmath19 .",
    "the applicability of sc also extends to nonlinear systems ; sc of the linearized nonlinear system around a state of interest @xmath111 is a sufficient condition for ( local ) controllability of the system from @xmath111 to any sufficiently close state in a sufficiently small time @xcite ( the same is also true if we are interested in a trajectory instead of single state @xmath111 ) .",

    "for most cases , obtaining the eigenvalues of @xmath19 and their geometric multiplicities is computationally demanding and requires specifying a value for the weight @xmath118 of each self - loop .",
    "for the special case of a single fixed weight @xmath119 for the self - dynamics of every node ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) , the number of driver nodes is equivalent to the one specified by sc using @xmath19 but setting all diagonal elements to zero @xcite .",
    "these considerations about self - dynamics are crucial when using sc on the nonlinear systems we consider , eqs .",
    "[ eq : sdyn1]-[eq : sdyn2 ] . since the nonlinear functions @xmath11 have a decay term that prevents the system from increasing without bounds",
    ", then a linearization of the @xmath11 s will give nonzero diagonal entries for @xmath19 .",
    "thus , sc would predict that a single driver signal is sufficient for controllability regardless of the topology of the real network considered , a result which tells us little about structure - based control in these networks .",
    "instead , we follow the approach of liu et al . @xcite and do not include the decay self - dynamics as a self - loop in the graph structure",
    ". two equivalent interpretations of this approach under sc are that ( i ) we consider the decay terms to not dominate the linearized dynamics ( i.e. , we set them to zero ) , or ( ii ) every element has the same ( or very similar ) fixed weight for its self - dynamics ( i.e. , the self - dynamics are fixed and every other nonzero entry in @xmath19 is arbitrary ) .",
    "here we use the maximum matching approach of liu et al .",
    "@xcite to identify the minimum number of driver nodes in @xmath122 . given a directed network ,",
    "an undirected bipartite graph is created in the following way : for every node @xmath8 in the original network , a node @xmath123 of type @xmath124 and a node @xmath125 of type @xmath126 are created in the bipartite graph .",
    "the connectivity in the bipartite graph is such that if node @xmath8 has a directed edge to node @xmath6 in the original network , then the bipartite graph will have an undirected edge from node @xmath123 to node @xmath127 . as liu et al",

    "<S> it can only provide sufficient conditions to control systems with nonlinear dynamics @xcite , and its definition of control ( full control ; from any initial to any final state ) does not always match the meaning of control in biological , technological , and social systems , in which control tends to involve only naturally occurring system states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several new methods of control have been proposed to incorporate the inherent nonlinear dynamics of real systems and relax the definition of full control @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> only one of these methods , namely feedback vertex set control ( fc ) , can be reliably applied to large complex networks in which only the structure is well known . </S>",
    "<S> this method , based on the mathematical framework in @xcite , incorporates the nonlinearity of the dynamics and considers only the naturally occurring end states of the system as desirable final states . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we study whether a complex network is difficult to control using sc and fc as benchmark methods , and identify the topological characteristics that underlie their commonalities and differences . </S>"
