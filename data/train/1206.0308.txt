    "if two systems containing mobile charge carriers are spatially separated such that direct charge transfer is not possible , but close enough to allow interaction between the carriers in different layers , the resulting momentum transfer will equalize the drift velocities in both systems . this frictional effect was experimentally observed between ( quasi ) two - dimensional electron gases in double quantum well structures @xcite . in most of the theoretical work",

    "show , the contribution of phonon mediated interaction to the drag resistivity is vanishingly small at low temperatures , but becomes noticeable for @xmath96k , the effect being more pronounced the larger the layer separation .",

    "it is also interesting to notice that in the range from 100 to 250k , the drag resistivity @xmath101 , including the effect of phonons , is closer to the @xmath102 behaviour @xmath69 than the purely coulomb drag result , @xmath72 .",

    "electron interaction via phonon exchange into the theory of coulomb drag significantly changes the magnitude of the predicted drag resistivity in graphene - hbn heterostructures . for large layer separations ,",
    "the deviations become noticeable at temperatures higher than 150k .",
    "as the lowest phonon resonance frequency in the spacer material hbn corresponds to a temperature of approximately 1100k , our result at first sight seems to be at odds with the notion that phonon effects should be proportional to the thermal population factor of the relevant modes .",
    "this is indeed the case for other transport phenomena , like the substrate limited electron mobility in graphene , where real momentum transfer from an electronic state ( in graphene ) to a phonon mode ( in a dielectric substrate material ) plays a role@xcite .",
    "the decay rate of the electronic state is then overall proportional to the thermal population of the phonon mode .",
    "our scenario however involves the exchange of virtual phonons in a process that is of second order in the interlayer interaction@xcite , and no decay processes into real phonon states are relevant for @xmath6 .",
    "we note that in ref .  , the effect of substrate phonons on coulomb drag was considered for the case where a material described by a uniform dielectric function fills what is our region iii of fig .",
    "[ fig : layer_general ] , and a deviation from the low - temperature @xmath102 behavior of @xmath6 was predicted for temperatures roughly an order of magnitude lower than the phononic resonance frequency of the substrate material .",
    "up to date , there remains considerable discrepancy between experimental data on coulomb drag between graphene layers embedded in sio@xmath7/al@xmath7o@xmath108@xcite and hbn@xcite and the existing theoretical work .",
    "for hbn , the reported drag resistivities in the fermi liquid regime are roughly a factor of three larger than predicted , and the results of the present paper do not change this situation .",
    "the experimentally reported @xmath102 dependence of @xmath6 for @xmath109 nm and @xmath110nm@xmath48 up to temperatures of 240k does not disagree with our results presented in .",
    "actually , it appears that in the temperature range of 100 to 250k the inclusion of phonon mediated interaction brings the behaviour of drag closer to the low temperature @xmath102 behaviour than with static coulomb interaction only . nevertheless , an extension of the experimental data shown in ref .   up to room temperature would be needed to distinguish clearly between @xmath6 and @xmath72 .",
