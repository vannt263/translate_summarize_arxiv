    "however , the direct detection of circumstellar disks around hbe at millimeter wavelengths has remained elusive until recently .",
    "we carried out a high sensitivity search for circumstellar disks around hbe with the aim of studying the frequency and time - scales of disks in these massive stars .",
    "we observed a sample of hbe in the continuum at mm- and cm- wavelengths using the pdbi and vla ( fuente et al . 2001 ; fuente et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter paper  i ) and detected two dusty disks around mwc  1080 and r mon with total ( gas+dust ) masses of @xmath10.003  m@xmath2 and @xmath10.01  m@xmath2 respectively .",
    "these were the first detections of dusty disks in hbe .",
    "r  mon is a very young hbe with a t tauri companion separated by 0.69@xmath6 . because of its youth , r mon is not directly visible in the optical but appears as a resolved conical reflection nebula in scattered light . at infrared wavelengths ,",
    "r mon appears as a point source located 0.06@xmath7@xmath80.02 south from the optical peak .",

    "( 1997 ) measured an extinction of a@xmath9=13.1 mag towards the star that they interpreted as due to an optically thick disk of radius , r@xmath10=100  au .",
    "our previous vla and pdbi images of r  mon at 1.3 cm , 0.7 cm and 2.7 mm showed a compact source located @xmath10.45@xmath7 south from the optical position ( paper  i ) . based on these interferometric observations we derived a mass of 0.01  m@xmath2 for the dusty disk .",
    "r mon hosts the most massive disk detected in hbe so far and it is the best candidate to study disks around massive stars . in this paper",
    ", we present observations at higher angular resolution and sensitivity of the r  mon disk in the continuum at 3 mm and 1.3 mm and in the @xmath3co rotational lines .",
    "our @xmath3co observations are consistent with the existence of a gaseous disk in keplerian rotation around the star .",
    "we present high - angular resolution observations in the continuum at 115.3 ghz and 230.5 ghz and in the @xmath3co 1@xmath40 and 2@xmath41 lines towards the b0 star r  mon .",
    "the @xmath3co observations were carried out with the iram array at plateau de bure ( pdbi ) from 2003 , december to 2004 , march in the c and a configuration providing a beam of 2.28@xmath7@xmath111.27@xmath7 at 115.3 ghz and 1.47@xmath7@xmath110.94@xmath7 at 230.5 ghz .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was determined from measurements on mwc349 , 0420 - 014 and 0528 + 134 .",
    "the maps were not corrected for primary beam attenuation . during 2006 , january we carried out continuum observations of this source using the new a@xmath12 configuration of pdbi .",
    "these observations provide a beam of 1.28@xmath7@xmath110.83@xmath7 at 2.7 mm and 0.72@xmath7@xmath110.33@xmath7 at 1.3 mm .",

    "the new high angular resolution continuum images are presented in fig .",
    "these images provide a more accurate position for the disk that now is settled to r.a.=06:39:09.954 dec=+08:44:09.55 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the peak emission in the new 2.7 mm continuum image is 4.1@xmath80.5  mjy / beam in agreement with our previous measurement published in paper  i. we have detected , for the first time , the r  mon disk at 1.3 mm .",
    "the peak flux in the 1.3 mm image is 7.2@xmath81.0 mjy / beam and the integrated flux is 11.8 mjy .",
    "this difference between the peak flux and the integrated flux at 1.3 mm suggests a spatial extension of @xmath10.3@xmath7 . at the distance of r",
    "mon , this implies a disk radius of @xmath1150  au .",
    "our new 1.3 mm measurement is consistent with our previous upper limit already discussed in paper i and implies a spectral index for the dust of @xmath13@xmath50.5 .",
    "the new value of the 1.3 mm flux can be used to further constrain the disk mass . after subtracting the free - free emission ,",
    "we have fitted the emission at millimeter wavelengths assuming thermal dust emission with t@xmath14=215  k ( natta et al . 2000 ) , @xmath15 and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 ( see more details in paper i ) .",
    "our best fit is obtained for a disk with a mass of 0.007  m@xmath2 and @xmath13=0.30.5 .",
    "values of @xmath13 between 0.5 and 1 are usually found in circumstellar disks around hae and tts and are thought to be evidence for grain growth in these disks ( see e.g. natta et al .",
    "the low value of @xmath13 in r  mon suggests that grain growth has proceeded to very large sizes already in the short lifetime of its disk .",
    "we have carried out high angular resolution mapping of the @xmath3co j=1@xmath40 and j=2@xmath41 lines towards r  mon using the pdbi . since the interferometer does not sample low spatial frequencies , almost all the flux is missed at the cloud velocities ( between 7.0 and 12.0  km  s@xmath16 ) .",
    "however , intense molecular emission is detected at the velocity intervals of 3.6  km  s@xmath16@xmath5v@xmath57.0  km  s@xmath16 and 12.0  km  s@xmath16@xmath5v@xmath515.6  km  s@xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "these @xmath3co observations allow us to study in detail the gas kinematics around r  mon .",

    "the weak component is extended in the north - south ( n - s ) direction . towards the north ,",
    "its emission presents a parabolic shape following the border of the infrared reflection nebula . towards the south ,",
    "the emission is concentrated in an elongated feature .",
    "since the emission at the velocity of the molecular cloud has been filtered out by the interferometer , our integrated intensity maps are actually the sum of the emission of the blue - shifted and red - shifted gas .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the integrated intensity maps of the emission at blue - shifted and red - shifted velocities separately .",
    "the emission presents a clear bipolar morphology with the blue lobe towards the north and the red one towards the south .",
    "this n - s distribution is consistent with the morphology of the bipolar outflow at large scale ( cant et al .",
    "1981 , bachiller et al . 1987 ) .",
    "the red lobe presents a jet - like morphology and remains unresolved in the direction perpendicular to it .",
    "jets in radio continuum at 1.3 cm ( paper i ) and [ sii ] emission ( movsessian et al . 2002 ) have previously been detected in r  mon .",
    "however , the direction of the red filament does not coincide with the direction of any of these jets but with the direction of one of the walls of the cavity suggesting that this high velocity emission arises in the entrained gas of the molecular cloud that is being accelerated by the outflow .    .model",

    "3 we show the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams of the emission of the @xmath3co 1@xmath40 and 2@xmath41 rotational lines in a strip perpendicular to the outflow ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the p - v diagrams show the characteristic @xmath22butterfly \" shape of a rotating disk .    we have modeled the emission of the @xmath3co 1@xmath40 and 2@xmath41 lines to have a deeper insight into the kinematics and physical characteristics of the disk .",

    "since the co emission has been filtered at the cloud velocities , we have only fitted the high velocity emission ( 3.6 km s@xmath16@xmath5v@xmath57.0 km s@xmath16 and 12.0 km s@xmath16@xmath5v@xmath515.6 km s@xmath16 ) . based on nir and mid - ir observations",
    ", several authors have proposed that contrary to hae and tts that host flared disks , hbe seem to have geometrically flat disks ( see e.g. acke et al .",
    "we have considered the two different geometries , a flared and a flat disk .",
    "the best fit with each geometry is shown in table 1 .",
    "the intensity ratio between the @xmath3co 1@xmath40 and 2@xmath41 lines is @xmath11 as expected for optically thick emission .",
    "since the @xmath3co lines are optically thick , the @xmath26butterfly \" shape is only dependent on the gas kinematics regardless of the disk geometry .",
    "the observational data are well fitted with a disk in keplerian rotation around the star .",
    "the outer radius of the disk is 1500  au , the inclination angle 20@xmath27@xmath85 and the mass of the star is constrained to 8@xmath81  m@xmath2 .",
    "the derived spectral types for r  mon range from b0 ( see e.g. hillenbrand 1992 ) to b8 ( mora et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the stellar mass we obtain is consistent with a star of a spectral type between b0 and b3 but it is larger than that expected for a b8 star .",
    "the high gas kinetic temperature derived using both the flat and the flared geometry also supports the classification of r  mon as an early be star ( see table 1 ) rather than as a cooler b8 object .",
    "since the @xmath3co lines are optically thick , the mass of the gaseous disk is not well determined by our observations .",
    "in fact , the estimated value of the mass is strongly dependent on the assumed geometry . using a flat disk ,",
    "the best fit is obtained with m@xmath14=0.014  m@xmath2 .",
    "a different disk mass is obtained with the flared geometry . in our flared model",
    "the height ( h ) increases linearly with the radius ( h  @xmath28  @xmath29 ) and the density is assumed to be constant in the z - direction .",
    "these assumptions are reasonable since in hydrostatic equilibrium h  @xmath28  @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , pitu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) based on interferometric co observations obtained that h  @xmath28  @xmath31 in the disk around the ae star hd  34282 .",
    "we obtain a reasonable fit to the data with h varying from 1 au ( at r=0.8 au ) to 1250 au ( at r=1500 au ) , and m=0.08 m@xmath2 .",
    "this mass is 10 times larger than that obtained from dust emission and a factor of 6 larger than that obtained from the co lines assuming a flat disk .",
    "this is quite surprising since in tts and hae the mass derived from the co lines ( assuming a standard co abundance ) is smaller than that derived from continuum observations ( see e.g. pitu et al .",
    "2003 ) and suggests that the disk associated with r  mon is very likely flat or at least flatter than those associated with tts and hae .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the low value of @xmath32 obtained in the case of the flat disk .",
    "however , we can not discard the possibility of a flared disk since the dust emissivity in the disk around r  mon could be smaller than in those around tts and hae because of the rapid grain growth and the fit we obtain using the flared disk is still reasonably good .",
    "the values of t@xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are similar in the flat and the flared disk models .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath35 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 are similar to those measured in the disks associated with tts and hae ( see e.g. dutrey et al .",
    "2004 ) suggesting that all these stars host disks with similar physical characteristics .    in fig .  3 and 4 we compare the results of our flat disk model with the observations",
    "the model fits very well the observations in the @xmath22red@xmath7 part of the p - v diagram .",
    "however there is a displacement between the observed emission and that predicted by the model in the @xmath22blue@xmath7 part ( see fig .  3 right ) .",
    "the only way to fit the blue part would be to assume an asymmetrical disk and/or an off - center star .",
    "r  mon is the first disk around a hbe detected in molecular lines and so far , our unique opportunity to investigate the physical structure and kinematics of the gas reservoir in the disks associated with these stars .",
    "our most interesting result is that the disk is in keplerian rotation around the star .",
    "keplerian rotation has also been found in most of the tts and hae studied so far and indicates a similar formation mechanisms for the stars in the range 18 m@xmath2 .",
    "the values obtained for the indexes @xmath34 and @xmath35 as well as that for the turbulent broadening are also similar to those found in tts and some hae ( see e.g. dutrey et al . 2004 ) .",
    "r  mon is a very young object ( age@xmath110@xmath37 yr ) which is still deeply embedded in the molecular cloud . on the contrary , tts",
    "are evolved objects ( age@xmath3810@xmath39 yr ) which are not any more associated with the parent molecular core ( age@xmath3810@xmath39 yr ) .",
    "the similarity between the disks of such different objects suggests a shorter timescale for the evolution of the disks associated with hbe .",
    "the low occurrence of disks associated with hbe also supports this conclusion . in paper",
    "i we showed that the disk masses in hbe stars are at least an order of magnitude lower than in hae stars .",
    "in fact , the ratio m@xmath14/m@xmath0 is roughly constant and equal to 0.04 for stars with spectral type a0-m7 and m@xmath14/m@xmath0 @xmath5 0.001 in hbe stars .",
    "this indicates a rapid dispersal of the disk material in hbe .    we have compared the r  mon disk with those associated with massive protostars in order to have a deeper insight into the evolution of disks around hbe .",
    "evidences for circumstellar disks have been found in massive protostars .",
    "the surface density in these disks is well described with @xmath402 ( cesaroni et al .",
    "this means that most of the gas is concentrated at small radii .",
    "recently , schreyer et al . ( 2006 ) detected a 1 m@xmath2 disk around mwc  490 , a 810 m@xmath2 star which is in a transition stage to hbe . in this case , the surface density varies with p@xmath411.5 and the disk radius is 1400 au .",
    "the values of @xmath35 and @xmath42 are similar to those derived in the disk around r  mon . however the mass of the mwc  490 disk is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of the r  mon disk .",
    "these results indicate that the disks around hbe flatten and lose a large fraction of their mass ( @xmath190% ) before the pre - main sequence phase ( @xmath510@xmath37 yr ) .",
    "the flattening of the disks can be due to the rapid grain growth .",
    "the low value of @xmath13 measured in r  mon is a clear evidence of the presence of large grains .",
    "the grain growth causes the optical depth of the disk to drop and allows the uv radiation to penetrate deep into the circumstellar disk and photo - evaporate the disk external layers ( dullemond & dominik 2004 ) .",
    "thus , we can propose an evolutionary sequence in which the disks associated with hbe start with a flaring shape but become flat during the pre - main sequence and lose most of their mass ( @xmath3890% ) before the star becomes visible ( @xmath510@xmath37 yr ) .",
    "the results of this letter are consistent with this scenario which , however , needs to be confirmed ."
