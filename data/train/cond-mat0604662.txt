    "a dynamic network of many nodes connected by weighted communication lines models a great variety of situations in physics , biology , chemistry and sociology , and it has a wide range of technological applications as well ; see , for instance , cnn1,marrob , newmannets , weight1,cp2005,nets05,weight2 . examples of weighted networks are the metabolic and food webs , which connect chains of different intensity , the internet , the world wide web and other social networks , in which agents may interchange different amounts of information or money , the transport nets , whose connections differ in capacity , number of transits and/or passengers , spin glasses and reaction  diffusion systems , in which diffusion , local rearrangements and reactions may vary the effective ionic interactions , and the immune system , the central nervous system and the brain , e.g. , high  level functions in the latter case seem to rely on synaptic changes .",
    "a rather general feature in these systems is that the nodes are not fully synchronized when performing a given task which may be either a matter of economy or else , perhaps more frequently , a necessary condition for efficient performance .",
    "even though this is as evident as the fact that links are seldom homogeneous , studies of partly synchronized networks are rare . furthermore , the relevant literature is dispersed , as it was generated in various distant fields , and a broad coherent description is lacking .",
    "in particular , related studies often disregard an important general property , namely , that the systems of interest are out of equilibrium .",
    "that is , they can not settle down into an equilibrium state but the network typically keeps wandering in a complex space of fixed points or , in one of the simplest cases , it reaches a _",
    "nonequilibrium _ steady state whose nature depends on dynamic details @xcite .",
    "this results in a complex landscape of emergent properties whose relation with the network details is poorly understood . in this paper , as a new effort aimed at methodizing somewhat the picture , we present some related exact results , together with illustrative monte carlo simulations , which apply to a rather general class of partly  synchronized heterogeneous or weighted networks .",
    "it follows , as a first application , examples of itinerancy and constructive chaos which mimic recent experimental observations .",
    "consider a network , with a processor , neuron , spin or , simply , variable at each node , and define the sets of node activities , @xmath6 and communication line weights , @xmath7 where @xmath8 each node is acted on by a local field @xmath9 which is induced by the weighted action of the other , @xmath10 nodes .",
    "we also define an additional , operational set of binary indexes , @xmath11 time evolution proceeds according to a generalized cellular  automaton strategy .",
    "that is , at each time unit , one simultaneously modifies the activity of @xmath12 variables , @xmath13 and the probability of the network state evolves in discrete time , @xmath14 according to @xmath15with the ( microscopic ) transition rate:@xmath16here , @xmath17 $ ] is the elementary local rate , @xmath18 is an arbitrary function of @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an inverse temperature  i.e .",
    ", a parameter which controls the stochasticity of the process and , for any set of @xmath12 sites chosen at random , one has that@xmath21",
    "this is the natural generalization of two familiar cases : the glauber sequential updating @xcite follows for @xmath22 so that it is obtained macroscopically in the limit of the minimal dynamic perturbation or @xmath23 while the above reduces to the little parallel updating @xcite for @xmath24 i.e. , as @xmath25 one may think of many situations whose understanding may benefit from studying the crossover between these two situations .",
    "for example , assuming a cell which is stimulated only in the presence of a neuromodulator such as dopamine , the parameter @xmath12 will correspond to the number of neurons that are modulated each cycle .",
    "that is , the other @xmath26 neurons receive no input but maintain memory of the previous state , which has been claimed to be at the basis of working memories @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , and also to have well defined references , we shall represent nodes in the following as binary variables , @xmath27 while @xmath28 and consider local rates @xmath29 , $ ] which is rather customary as a case that satisfies detailed balance @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that , in general , detailed balance is not fulfilled by our basic equation ( [ meq ] ) nor by the superposition ( [ rate ] ) as far as @xmath30 consequently , in general , our system can not be described by gibbs ensemble theory .",
    "we shall further assume that the fields satisfy @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{hi}\\]]we are assuming here a set of @xmath32 given _ patterns _ , namely , different realizations of the network set of activities , to be denoted as @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 where the product @xmath36 measures the _ overlap _ of the current state with pattern @xmath37 for @xmath38 and finite @xmath39 i.e. , in the limit @xmath40 from ( [ meq])([hi ] ) , the mesoscopic time  evolution equation@xmath41 \\right\\ } + \\left ( 1-\\rho \\right ) \\pi _ { t}^{\\mu } \\left ( \\mathbf{\\sigma } \\right )    \\label{mt}\\]]follows for any @xmath37 the details of the derivation , as well as some possible generalizations of this result , will be published elsewhere cortesnew .",
    "one of the simplest realizations of the above is the hopfield network hopf1,hopf2,perettob . in this case , the communication line weights are heterogeneous but fixed according to the hebb ( _ learning _ ) prescription @xmath42 and the local fields are @xmath43 these choices satisfy condition ( [ hi ] ) which also holds for other non  linear _ learning _ rules ; in any case , one may easily generalize ( [ mt ] ) to include other interesting cases ( see , for instance , @xcite ) which do not precisely conform to ( [ hi ] ) .",
    "the original hopfield model evolves by glauber processes , namely , by attempting a single variable change , @xmath44 at each unit time e.g .",
    ", the monte carlo step with probability @xmath45 the symmetry @xmath46 and detailed balance then guarantee asymptotic convergence to _ equilibrium _ , i.e. , @xmath47    computational efficiency has sometimes motivated to induce time evolution of the hopfield network by the little strategy , i.e. , @xmath48 in our formulation .",
    "this is known to drive the system to a full _ nonequilibrium _ situation , in general @xcite . the local rule and other details of dynamics",
    "are then essential in determining the emergent behavior .",
    "not only the time evolution may vary but also the nature of the resulting asymptotic state , perhaps including morphology , phase diagram , universality class , etc . ; see refs.@xcite for some outstanding examples of this assertion .    for completeness",
    ", we mention that the hopfield network , i.e. , @xmath49 will also correspond , in general , to a nonequilibrium situation when implemented ( unlike in the original proposal @xcite ) with asymmetric or time  evolving weights or with a dynamic rule lacking detailed balance .",
    "there is some chance that an _ effective hamiltonian _ @xcite _ _ , _ _ such that @xmath50 can then be defined , however .",
    "when this is the case , one may often apply equilibrium methods , with the result of relatively simple emergent properties torresjpa , cortesnc .",
    "concerning our proposal ( [ mt ] ) , we first mention that , assuming fields that conform to the hebb prescription with static weights , the hopfield property of _ associative memory _ is recovered for @xmath51 as expected . that is , for high enough @xmath20 ( which means below certain stochasticity ) the patterns @xmath52 may be attractors of dynamics .",
    "consequently , an initial state resembling one of the patterns , e.g. , a degraded picture will converge towards the original one , which mimics simple recognition @xcite .",
    "we checked too that , in agreement with some previous indications @xcite , implementing the hopfield ",
    "hebb network with @xmath53 produces the behavior that characterizes the familiar case @xmath54 including associative memory , even though equilibrium is precluded , e.g. , in general , no effective hamiltonian is predicted to exist for any @xmath53 @xcite . excluding these hopfield  hebb versions , our model exhibits a complex behavior which depends dramatically on the value of @xmath55 this is a consequence of changes with @xmath3 in the stability associated with ( [ mt ] ) , as we show next .",
    "the local fields may be determined according to various criteria , depending on the specific application of interest .",
    "that is , one may investigate the consequences of equation ( [ mt ] ) and associated stability for different relations between the fields and the weights @xmath56 and between these and other network properties .",
    "we shall be mostly concerned in the rest of this paper with a specific _ neural automaton _ as a working example . in this case",
    ", the above assumption of static line weights happens to be rather unrealistic . as a matter of fact ,",
    "one is eager to admit , concerning different contexts , that the communication line weights may change with the nodes activity , and even that they may loose some competence after a time interval of heavy work .",
    "this seems confirmed in the case of the brain where the transmission of information and many computations are strongly correlated with activity  induced fast fluctuations of the synaptic intensities , namely , our @xmath56 s @xcite . furthermore , assuming the experimental observation that synaptic changes may induce _ depression _",
    "depre0 seems to have important consequences @xcite .",
    "that is , a repeated presynaptic activation may decrease the neurotransmitter release , which will depress the postsynaptic response and , in turn , affect noticeably the system behavior . for concreteness , motivated by these facts , we shall adopt here the proposal in refs.@xcite .",
    "this amounts to assume a simple generalization of the hebb prescription which is in accordance with condition ( [ hi ] ) , namely,@xmath57 n^{-1}\\sum_{\\mu = 1}^{m}\\xi _ { i}^{\\mu } \\xi _ { j}^{\\mu } ,   \\label{wnew}\\]]where @xmath58 depends on the set of stored patterns .",
    "the hopfield case discussed above is recovered for @xmath59 while other values of this parameter correspond to fluctuations which induce depression of synapses by a factor @xmath60 on the average .",
    "the choice ( [ wnew ] ) happens to importantly modify the network behavior , even for a single _ stored _ pattern , @xmath61 the stationary , @xmath62 solution of ( [ mt ] ) is then @xmath63 with @xmath64 \\right\\ } + \\left ( 1-\\rho \\right ) \\pi , \\label{efe}\\]]and local stability requires that @xmath65 the fixed point is therefore @xmath66 \\right\\ } , $ ] independent of @xmath4 while stability crucially depends on @xmath55 the limiting condition @xmath67 corresponds to a steady  state bifurcation .",
    "this implies for @xmath68 that @xmath69 independent of both @xmath3 and @xmath70 non  trivial solutions @xmath71 in this case require that @xmath72 which includes the hopfield case .",
    "the other limiting condition @xmath73 corresponds to a period doubling bifurcation .",
    "it follows from this that local stability requires @xmath74 with@xmath75 -\\beta + 1\\right\\ } ^{-1}.   \\label{pc}\\]]it is to be remarked that this condition can not be fulfilled in the hopfield , @xmath76 case , for which one obtains from ( [ pc ] ) the nonsense solution @xmath77    the resulting behavior is illustrated in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "this shows , for @xmath78 the onset of chaos at @xmath79 in the saddle  point map ( [ mt ] ) and , accurately fitting this , in monte carlo simulations .",
    "the behavior shown in the top graph of figure [ figure1 ] , which is for @xmath80 is likely to characterize any @xmath81 as well .",
    "this behavior does not occur for the singular hopfield case with static synapses , for which the stability of @xmath82 is independent of @xmath55 the bottom graph in figure [ figure1 ] illustrates that one has for @xmath83 regimes of regular oscillations among the attractors ( i.e. , the given pattern and its negative  in this case with @xmath84 which are eventually interrupted as one varies @xmath4 even slightly , by eventual chaotic jumping .",
    "the critical value of the synchronization parameter for the emergence of chaos , due to local instabilities around the steady @xmath85 solution may be estimated in figure [ figure1 ] as @xmath86 for @xmath61 this is precisely the value that one obtains from equation ( [ pc ] ) for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89    figure [ figure2 ] confirms that this behavior occurs also for @xmath90 stored patterns , and figure [ figure3 ] shows the detail during the _ stationary _ part of typical runs for representative values of @xmath91 in particular , figure [ figure3 ] illustrates qualitatively  different types of time series our model exhibits , namely , from bottom to top : ( _ i _ ) convergence towards one of the attractors",
    "in fact , to one of the _ antipatterns_ for @xmath92 ( _ ii _ ) chaos , i.e. , fully irregular behavior with a positive lyapunov exponent for @xmath93 ( _ iii _ ) a perfectly regular oscillation between one of the attractors and its negative for @xmath94 ( _ iv _ ) onset of chaotic oscillations as @xmath3 is increased somewhat ; and ( _ v _ ) very rapid and completely ordered and periodic oscillations between one pattern and its antipattern when all the nodes evolve synchronized with each other at each time step .",
    "the cases ( _ ii _ ) and , less markedly , ( _ iv _ ) are nice examples of instability  induced switching phenomena .",
    "that is , as suggested also in experiments on biological systems ( see next section ) , the network describes heteroclinic paths among the stored patterns , remaining for different time intervals in the neighborhood of different attractors , the choice of attractor being at random .",
    "in summary , we report in this paper on a class of homogeneous or weighted networks in which the density , @xmath4 or the number of variables that are synchronously updated at a time may be varied .",
    "this is remotely related to _",
    "dynamics , _ _ block  sequential , _ and associated algorithms @xcite , which aim at more efficient computations , and it generalizes some previous proposals rosspra , herzpre , jcortes .",
    "we describe in detail the behavior of a particular realization of the class , namely , a _ neural automaton _ which is motivated by recent neurobiological experiments and related theoretical analysis . different realizations of the class correspond to different choices of the local fields @xmath95 that act upon the stochastic variables at the ( neural ) nodes . for certain values of these fields , which amount to fix the ( synaptic ) connections at some constant values , e.g. , according to the hebb prescription ,",
    "one recovers the equilibrium hopfield network .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is then irrelevant concerning most of the system properties .",
    "our model also admits simple extensions , corresponding to other values of the local fields , that one may characterize by a complex _ effective temperature _ @xcite .",
    "the hopfield picture has severe limitations concerning its practical usefulness @xcite , and some of these limitations may be overcome by producing a full nonequilibrium condition .",
    "it is sensible to expect that @xmath3 will then transform into a relevant parameter .",
    "this is , in fact , the situation in @xcite which deals with a modification of the hebb prescription which includes multiple interactions , random dilution and a gaussian noise .",
    "this implies a choice for the fields that even precludes the existence of an effective temperature , and chaotic neural activity ensues . our biologically motivated choice , namely , hopfield local fields with the simple prescription ( [ wnew ] ) , which is interpreted as a consequence of depressing synaptic fluctuations , induces a full nonequilibrium condition even for @xmath96 in this limit",
    ", the system was recently shown to exhibit enhancement of the network sensitivity to external stimuli @xcite .",
    "this happens to be a feature of the system for any @xmath55 this interesting behavior , which we illustrate in figure [ figure4 ] , corresponds to a type of instability which is known to occur in nature , as discussed below .",
    "this is associated here to a modification of the topology of the space of fixed points due to the action of the involved @xmath97controlled noise .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] is a model remake of experiments on the odor response of the ( projection ) neurons in the locust antennal lobe @xcite .",
    "our simulation illustrates two time series ( with different colors ) for the mean firing rate , @xmath98 in a system with six stored patterns which is exposed to two different stimuli of the same intensity and duration ( between 3000 and 4000 time steps each step corresponding here to @xmath12 trials ) .",
    "each pattern consists of a string of @xmath99 binary variables ; three of them are generated at random with , respectively , 40% , 50% and 60% of the variables set equal to 1 ( the rest are set equal to @xmath100 while the other three have the 1s at the first 70% , 50% and 20% positions in the string , respectively .",
    "the bottom graph shows with horizontal lines the baseline activity without stimulus ( bs ) and the network activity level in the presence of the stimulus @xmath101 ( sa1 ) and @xmath102 ( sa2 ) , which correspond to two of the random stored patterns .",
    "the conclusion is that the stimulus destabilizes the system activity as in the laboratory experiments .",
    "note , however , that this occurs for @xmath103 i.e. , in the absence of chaotic behavior . as a matter of fact",
    ", the behavior in figure [ figure4 ] will also be exhibited in the limit @xmath49 which does not show any irregular behavior @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the suggestion that fluctuating connections may induce fractal or _",
    "strange _ attractors as far as @xmath53 jcortes , marropre is confirmed here . as illustrated in figure [ figure3 ] , our system may exhibit both static and kind of dynamic associative memory in this case .",
    "that is , the network state either will go to one of the attractors ( corresponding to one of the given patterns _ stored _ in the connecting synapses ) or else , for @xmath104 will forever remain visiting several or perhaps all the possible attractors .",
    "furthermore , the inspection rounds may abruptly become irregular and even chaotic as the density of synchronized neurons varies slightly .",
    "it follows , in particular , that the most interesting , oscillatory behavior requires synchronization of a minimum of variables , and also that occurring chaotic jumps between attractors requires some careful tuning of @xmath55 in fact , as illustrated in the bottom graph of figure [ figure1 ] , once the critical condition @xmath83 is fulfilled a complex situation ensues where it seems difficult to predict the resulting behavior for slight variations of @xmath55    the chaotic behavior is further illustrated in figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "this shows trajectories among the three stored patterns , namely , @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xmath108 these are designed , respectively , as a homogeneous string of 1s , a string with the first 50% positions set to 1 and the rest to @xmath109 and as a string with only the first 20% positions set to 1 .",
    "we observe many jumps between two close ( more correlated ) patterns and , eventually , a jump to the most distant pattern .",
    "it seems sensible to comment on this behavior at the light of the growing evidence of chaotic behavior in the nervous system @xcite .",
    "we have shown ( e.g. , figure [ figure4 ] ) that chaos is not needed to have efficient adaptation to a changing environment .",
    "however , one may argue caos1 , for instance , that the instability inherent to chaotic motions facilitates this and , in particular , the system ability to move to any pattern at any time .",
    "this behavior , which has been described for the activity of the olfactory bulb and other cases , is nicely illustrated in figures [ figure3 ] and [ figure5 ] .",
    "our network thus mimics the observed correlation between chaotic neuron activity and states of attention in the brain , as well as other cases of constructive chaos in biology attent1,attent2,attent2bis , attent3 .",
    "chaos has been reported in other interesting networks ( e.g. , ref .",
    "domin ) but , to our knowledge , never in such a general setting as here . as a matter of fact",
    ", the present model allows for some natural generalizations @xcite and , in particular , suggests a great interest for a more detailed study of the apparently unpredictable behavior it exhibits for @xmath110 this teaches us that varying @xmath3 is a simple method to control chaos in networks , and that this may also help in determining efficient computation strategies @xcite . concerning the latter ,",
    "the model behavior may be relevant , for instance , when judging on the best procedure for specific data mining and for the control of different activities on a multiprocessor system @xcite , and deciding on whether to implement sequential or parallel programming in some extreme cases @xcite .",
    "our findings here may also help one in interpreting recent experimental evidence of parallel processing in laminar neocortex microcircuits @xcite .",
    "that is , a comparison between the model behavior and experimental results may shed light on the dynamics of these circuits and their mutual interactions .",
