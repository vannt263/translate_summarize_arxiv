    "therefore , a thorough understanding of the physical and chemical properties of puo@xmath0 is of great significance , full of challenges and has always attracted attention .",
    "recently , there have occurred in the literature a series of experimental reports @xcite on the strategies of storage of pu - based waste .",
    "when exposed to air and moisture , metallic plutonium surface rapidly oxidizes to puo@xmath0 @xcite . under special aqueous condition",
    ", the interaction of puo@xmath0 surface with adsorbed water can generate non - stoichiometric puo@xmath14 ( x@xmath150.27 ) @xcite via an overall reaction , namely , puo@xmath0+@xmath16h@xmath0o@xmath17puo@xmath14+h@xmath0 .",
    "however , the oxidation of puo@xmath0 has been proved to be strongly endothermic by subsequent first - principles theoretical calculation @xcite . to test the possible existence of surface puo@xmath14 ,",
    "recent photoemission study @xcite has been carried out and found that puo@xmath0 is only covered by a chemisorbed layer of oxygen and can be easily desorbed at elevated temperature .",
    "thus , puo@xmath0 is generally acknowledged as the highest stable pu - oxide under ambient conditions .",
    "however , under oxygen - lean conditions ( in the vacuum or inert gas ) , the puo@xmath0-layer can be  reduced to sesquioxides ( pu@xmath0o@xmath9 ) , which can promote the corrosion of the pu - metal by hydrogen @xcite . as we know , the low - temperature phase of pu - sesequioxide is a phase with space group @xmath18 ( no .",
    "206 ) , which is similar in the crystal structure to the cubic puo@xmath0  ( @xmath19 , no .",
    "225 ) with the 25% o vacancy located in the 16@xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) sites .",
    "the above mentioned experimental observations indicate that the surface of puo@xmath0 is to some extent chemically inactive , however , the formation of o vacancies can prominently modify the electronic structure properties of  both the bulk and the surface of puo@xmath0 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the surface layers are directly involved in the significant corrosion processes and many technological applications of the actinide oxides , thus a deep understanding of the physical and chemical properties of puo@xmath0 surfaces is always desirable .",
    "however , due to the radioactivity and toxicity of pu and the complexity of the pu element and pu - o system , it is extraordinarily difficult to experimentally explore the surface atomic and electronic structure properties of the pu - oxides , and particularly so for a single phase compound .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", conventional density - functional theory ( dft ) that applies the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) underestimates the strong on - site coulomb repulsion of the 5f electrons and , consequently , describes puo@xmath0 as incorrect ferromagnetic fm conductor @xcite instead of antiferromagnetic afm mott insulator reported by experiment @xcite .",
    "similar problems have been confirmed in studying other correlated materials within the pure lda / gga schemes .",
    "fortunately , several approaches , including the lda / gga+@xmath1 @xcite , the hybrid density functional of ( heyd , scuseria , and enzerhof ) hse @xcite , the self - interaction corrected local spin density sic - lsd @xcite , and lda combined dynamical mean - field theory dmft @xcite , have been developed to correct these failures in calculations of actinide compounds .",
    "the effective modification of pure dft by lda / gga+@xmath1 formalisms has been confirmed widely in study of puo@xmath0 @xcite . by tuning the effective hubbard parameter in a reasonable range ,",
    "the afm mott insulator feature was correctly calculated and the structural parameters as well as the electronic structure are well in accord with experiments . however , those increasing theoretical researches have been focusing on the bulk properties of puo@xmath0 , and very little is known regarding its surface physical and chemical properties , which is in sharp contrast to the depth and comprehensiveness of researches conducted upon the transition metal and rare earth oxides @xcite . as far as we are aware ,",
    "few dft studies of the puo@xmath0 ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces have been presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "in addition , one of the most important issues , i.e. , the possible formation of o vacancies and their effect on the atomic and electronic structures of puo@xmath0 surfaces , remains completely unexplored .",
    "motivated by the above mentioned facts , in this paper , we systematically study the surface properties of puo@xmath0 .",
    "specifically , we have addressed ( i ) the structural stabilities of the low - index puo@xmath0(111 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 001 ) surfaces based on the calculations of surface energies and surface relaxations , ( ii ) the surface electronic properties such as the surface work function and layer - projected density of the state ( pdos ) , and ( iii ) the effects of pu - oxide thickness and o - vacancy on the surface stabilities and electronic structure properties .",

    "our calculated equilibrium lattice parameter @xmath34=@xmath35   within gga+@xmath1 or @xmath34=@xmath36   within lda+@xmath1 is in good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "various convergence tests have been performed to ensure the above mentioned input parameters and models feasible and reasonable in our current calculations .",
    "the result thereof shows that the surface energy of a slab with certain thickness is converged within 3 mev / @xmath49 . in this paper , for the convenience of depiction and plotting",
    ", we are using the number of pu - cation layer @xmath50 in a puo@xmath0  slab to represent its thickness .",
    "thus , one can see in figs .",
    "1(a)-(c ) that the ideal ( 111 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 001 ) slabs have the same thickness tag , namely , @xmath50= 6 , and it is worth noting that in practice these slabs consist of 18 , 6 and 13 atomic monolayers ( mls ) , respectively .    according to tasker s conclusion @xcite on the surface stabilities of ionic crystals , the side - view of three low - index puo@xmath0 surfaces in fig .",
    "1 can reveal  that the oxygen - terminated ( 111 ) surface , consisting of successive and electrically neutral o - pu - oblocks , is the tasker - type - ii  surface , the ( 110 ) is the typical type - i surface stacked with identical neutral planes fulfilling the puo@xmath0 stoichiometry , and the ( 001 ) is the typical type - iii  surface , consisting of oppositely charged planes .",
    "generally , type - i and type - ii are stable nonpolar surfaces , while type - iii is unstable polar surface due to the dipole moment of the repeated unit in @xmath41 direction .",
    "the dipole moment may be quenched and the polar surface stabilized by a variety of methods@xcite , including surface reconstruction , the presence of adsorbates , and changes in the surface electronic structure . in our present work , the polar ( 001 ) surface is modeled as two oxygen - terminated surfaces with 50% oxygen vacancies to fulfill the stoichiometric formula , and the different distributions of the 50% o - vacancy considered here are showed in fig .",
    "besides above - mentioned three low - index surfaces , the pu - terminated ( 111 ) surface generated by removing the outmost o layers of the o - terminated ( 111 ) surface has been found to be quite unstable and eventually become o - terminated through a significant reconstruction in the surface region due to the intense dipole - dipole interaction . in such stable structure , the upper layers resemble the @xmath51-pu@xmath0o@xmath9(0001 ) surface .",
    "thus , we exclude the pu - terminated ( 111 ) slab model and briefly name the o - terminated puo@xmath0(111 ) surface as ( 111 ) surface if not mentioned differently .",
    "the surface energy @xmath52 is the energy needed to produce a unit surface from a 3d infinite crystal and is one central quantity in the studies of the relative stability of different surfaces . in the dft total - energy calculations of repeated slab - supercell geometries , @xmath52 can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total energy of the supercell with relaxed / unrelaxed slab , @xmath55 is the energy of the reference bulk with the same number of atoms , and the denominator @xmath56 is the total area of both surfaces of the slab with a finite thickness . here , the convergence of the @xmath52 ( i.e. , @xmath57 in eq.(1 ) )",
    "is mainly determined by two correlated factors , namely , the atomic structural relaxations in several outmost layers and the thickness of the slab model . for the surface structural relaxations",

    "the effect of the slab thickness should be highlighted especially when the slab consists of the complicated compounds such as the actinide oxides , and in addition , the work functions calculated with slab approximations are known to be depending on the slab thickness .",
    "thus , in this work , both factors will be considered and discussed in detail .",

    "note that the slab thickness is defined by the number @xmath50 of the pu - cation layers .",
    "four different terminations of defect-(001 ) slabs in ( b ) are described in fig .",
    "1(d ) . ]",
    "the calculated surface energy for fully relaxed  ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) slabs as a function of the thickness is illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) . obviously , both the gga+@xmath1 and lda+@xmath1 calculations give the consistent results that the ( 110 ) surface energy is much higher than the ( 111 ) surface energy",
    ". generally , the calculated @xmath52 for ( 110 ) is 42% with gga+@xmath1 ( or 33% with lda+@xmath1 ) higher than for ( 111 ) .",
    "therefore , the puo@xmath0(111 ) surface is much more stable than the more open  ( 110 ) surface with relatively higher concentration of the surface dangling bonds .",
    "for these two non - polar surfaces , fig .",
    "2(a ) furthermore shows two points worthy of special notice and further discussion : ( i ) despite the large difference in their respective @xmath52 between gga+@xmath1 and lda+@xmath1 calculations , the upper value ( i.e. , the lda+@xmath1 result ) of the ( 111 ) surface is notably smaller than the lower value ( i.e. , the gga+@xmath1 result ) of the ( 110 ) surface ; ( ii)the @xmath52 of the ( 111 ) surface is insensitive to the thickness with steady values ( 0.045ev / @xmath49 for gga+@xmath1 and 0.065ev / @xmath49 for lda+@xmath1 ) , whereas for the ( 110 ) surface the evolution of @xmath52 as a function of slab thickness shows an oscillating behavior , which indicates excellent agreement between lda+@xmath1 and gga+@xmath1 .    for the dft energetic studies of solid materials",
    ", it is well known that the gga calculation usually underestimates the experimental value and on the contrary the lda often reports overestimated results for many physical quantities , amongst which the surface energy is a typical one .",
    "these opposite deviations from the experimental measurement have been attributed to the overbinding  character of lda and the consequent overcorrection of this defect in gga @xcite .",
    "however , we are more interested in comparing the relative stabilities of different surfaces than in assessing the different performances of lda  and gga functionals , especially in the absence of the experimental data .",
    "as far as we are aware , a few existing dft calculations have given a similar trend in lda- and gga-@xmath52 results of metal oxides .",
    "for example , the lda-@xmath52 results are 35% and 22% higher than the gga results for ceo@xmath0(111 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces @xcite , respectively , while for mgo(001 ) surface the lda-@xmath52 is 25.8% higher than the gga-@xmath52 with the experimental values positioned in between . here , based on the above - mentioned point ( i ) , we are positive that the experimental observation will agree on the prominent stability of the puo@xmath0(111 ) surface .",
    "we now turn our attention to the evolution with the slab thickness of the surface energies in fig .",
    "as is known , for a certain cleaved surface , the consequent structural relaxation is an effective way to minimize the surface cleavage energy , corresponding to the @xmath97 , with the contribution defined as the surface relaxation energy @xmath98=@xmath99 . for ( 111 ) surface ,",
    "the @xmath97  ( not plotted here ) is very close to the @xmath57 , producing a quite small @xmath98 less than 1.0 mev / @xmath49 , and the thickness effect on the surface relaxation can be neglected . from fig .",
    "2(a ) , one can see that the @xmath97 of ( 110 ) surface is clearly larger than the corresponding @xmath57 with their difference ( @xmath100 ) being higher than @xmath101 mev / @xmath49 .",
    "additionally , we find that the @xmath97 is to some extent insensitive to the slab thickness , thus the oscillating behavior of @xmath57 is tied up to the dependence of @xmath98 upon the slab thickness .     of ( a ) the ( 111 ) slab and ( b ) ( 110 ) slab with @xmath102 .",
    "( c ) sketch map of the vertical displacement @xmath103 in the surface and subsurface of the relaxed ( 110 ) slab due to the mismatch @xmath104-pu @xmath105-o .",
    "( d ) the @xmath103 in both surface and subsurface of ( 110 ) slab and the relaxation surface energy @xmath100 as a function of the slab thickness . ]    in order to draw a clear comparison of the surface relaxation between ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces  and gain a detailed understanding of  the oscillating behavior of ( 110)-@xmath57 , it proves to be quite necessary to discuss the surface structures undergoing full relaxations .",
    "figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) show the interlayer relaxations along the directions perpendicular to the ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces respectively . here",
    "the interlayer relaxation @xmath106 is given by the optimized interlayer distance @xmath107  in a relaxed slab compared to the bulk interlayer distance @xmath108 along the corresponding direction .",
    "obviously , the signs @xmath109 and @xmath110 of @xmath106  indicate expansion and contraction of the interlayer spacing respectively .",
    "the stacking sequence of the ( 111 ) slab with @xmath50=@xmath111 consists of 9 o - pu - o  blocks , and therefore this ( 111 ) slab contains totally 27 atomic monolayers ( mls ) .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "3(a ) that the interlayer relaxations are really small , so that the shrinkage ratio of the thickness is only @xmath1120.25% .",
    "the ( 110 ) slabs used in fig .",
    "3(b ) contain 9 atomic mls with two oxygen and one plutonium atoms per 1@xmath1131 cell being coplanar .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows that ( i ) the interlayer relaxations in the ( 110 ) surface region of a few atomic layers are prominently larger than those of the ( 111 ) surface in fig .",
    "3(a ) ; ( ii ) the interlayer relaxations of pu sublattice are larger than the oxygen sublattice , which is especially apparent in the outmost two layers .",
    "such mismatch of the relaxations between o- and pu - sublattices gives rise to the vertical displacement @xmath103 between o and pu atoms which are coplanar in the unrelaxed ( 110 ) slab .",
    "figure 3(c ) gives a sketch map of the @xmath103 in the surface and subsurface layers as a result of the mentioned mismatch : @xmath104-pu @xmath114-o .",
    "one can see that due to the nonzero @xmath103 , cation - anion dipoles with inverse orientations are generated in the surface and subsurface respectively",
    ". strictly speaking , the relaxed ( 110 ) surface is now not a nonpolar surface for pu and o species .",
    "as we are aware , this observable surface polarization of puo@xmath0(110 ) slab induced by the structural relaxation is in good agreement with previous dft calculation @xcite . besides the interlayer ( vertical ) relaxation , the inplane ( lateral ) relaxation of the surface layer ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) tends to shorten the pu - o bond on the surface by driving two nearest - neighbor oxygen atoms ( bonding to the same pu atom ) to close up by @xmath115 , leading to the formation of o - o dimers on the ( 110 ) surface .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the vertical displacement @xmath103  shows an oscillating behavior with the increasing slab thickness while the structure of the inplane o - o dimers is to some extent insensitive to the slab thickness . to reveal a clear - cut relationship between the structural relaxation and the corresponding released energy @xmath100",
    ", we plot the @xmath103 ( in both surface and subsurface ) and @xmath98 as functions of the slab thickness @xmath50 in fig . 3(d ) .",
    "one can see that the oscillating behaviors of @xmath103  and @xmath98 are quite in - phase , indicating that the oscillations of @xmath52 of ( 110 ) surface as a function of slab thickness  originate from the interlayer relaxation .",
    "the ideal puo@xmath0(001 ) surface ( see fig .",
    "1(c ) ) is an unstable polar surface with an overall dipole field .",
    "however , it is found that 50% surface o vacancies in our defective ( 001 ) slab models ( see fig .",
    "1(d ) ) can effectively quench the dipole field and stabilize the surface . considering that a half oxygen vacancies can usually induce the significant surface reconstruction , here",
    "we first carry out the first - principles molecular dynamic ( fpmd ) simulations based on gga+@xmath1 within the micro - canonical ensemble to sufficiently optimize the defect-(001 ) surface structures and then calculate their zero - temperature surface energies . from the @xmath52 result ( including @xmath57 and @xmath97 ) presented in fig .",
    "2(b ) as a function of the slab thickness @xmath50 , one can see that with increasing @xmath50 , the @xmath57 for the four defect-(001 ) surface models converges to @xmath116ev / @xmath49 , which is still notably larger than that of the ( 110 ) surface .",
    "interestingly , according to the results of @xmath57 , surf-3 and surf-4 slab models are a bit less stable than surf-1 and surf-2 in the whole range of slab thickness that we considered .",
    "however , the values of @xmath97 for surf-3 and surf-4 models are lower than those for surf-1 and surf-2 models mainly due to the two different distributions of the surface oxygen vacancies , namely , the missing - row and uniform types in surf-1/surf-2 and surf-3/surf-4 respectively .",
    "after the structural optimization by the fpmd simulations , for all four defect-(001 ) surface models with @xmath117 , the surface oxygens as well as the subsurface oxygens beneath relax inward by @xmath118 and @xmath119   respectively , while the subsurface oxygens without surface oxygen above relax outward by @xmath120  . for surf-1/surf-2 ,",
    "the pu - sublattice relaxes inward by @xmath121  , on the contrary , the pu - sublattice relaxes outwards by @xmath122   for surf-3/surf-4 .",
    "accompanied with a slight discrepancy in vertical relaxations of the pu - sublattice for surf-1/surf-2 and surf-3/surf-4 , it is found that the difference in @xmath98  for these two types of ( 001 ) terminations is mainly caused by the distinguishing inplane ( lateral ) relaxations of subsurface pu - sublattices , which are sketched in figs .",
    "4(b ) and 4(c ) .",
    "for surf-1/surf-2 , the pu atoms bonding to the same surface oxygen atom relax to close up by @xmath123   and this periodic lattice distortion consequently provoke the zigzag manner reconstruction of surface oxygen - lattice from the initial linear chain .",
    "interestingly , this peculiar reconstruction was experimentaly observed in the defective polar ( 001 ) surface of uranium dioxide uo@xmath0 with 50% oxygen vacancies @xcite . however , because of the uniform distribution of the surface o - vacancies , the pu and o atoms in surf-3/surf-4 keep lateral inaction . for the defective ( 001 ) surfaces ,",
    "our current results show that both the slab thickness and the distributions of the surface o - vacancies can notably impact the surface stability , and there may be several more stabilizing mechanisms coexisting on the polar ( 001 ) surface . to briefly summarize our results in this section , we give the relative order of stability for low - index puo@xmath0 surfaces , namely , ( 111 ) @xmath2  ( 110 ) @xmath2 defect-(001 ) @xmath2 polar-(001 ) , which is well consistent with that of ceo@xmath0 @xcite and uo@xmath0 @xcite , which are of the same fluorite structure as puo@xmath0 .",

    "the orbital - resolved pdos of the bulk puo@xmath0 at the ground state has been calculated and analyzed in detail by previous dft+@xmath1 @xcite and hybrid dft @xcite studies , and those theoretical results of dos are usually tested by comparing with the experimental photoelectron spectroscopy ( pes ) measurements @xcite .    ,",

    "the fermi level is indicated by the vertical dashed line at @xmath60 ev . ]    here , we replot the pdos of the bulk puo@xmath0 with afm  phase as a benchmark for those of the pu - o atoms on different puo@xmath0 surfaces , aiming at finding significant influence in the electronic structure by the inclusion of surface effect .",
    "the pdos of bulk puo@xmath0 in fig .",
    "5(a ) demonstrates the following features : ( i ) above the fermi level , the insulating band gap is about @xmath124 ev , which is in good agreement with the experimental measurement @xcite ; ( ii ) below the fermi level the highest occupied band ( hob ) with a range of @xmath125 to @xmath60 ev is mainly the @xmath126(pu)-@xmath127(o ) hybridization , with little contributions from @xmath128 and @xmath129 states of pu ; ( iii ) the lower occupied band ( lob ) with a range of @xmath130 to @xmath131 ev consists of pu-@xmath128 and o-@xmath132 states . from the surface",
    "dos in fig .",
    "5 , one can see that the pdos distribution for the ( 111 ) surface shows a close resemblance to the case of the bulk puo@xmath0 , specifically , the similarities in the insulating band gap and the structures of pu-@xmath126 state with two pronounced peaks are so strong that the slight contraction and shift - up of the hob are almost covered up . for the ( 110 ) surface , the insulating band gap reduces to @xmath133 ev , and particularly , the two - peak structure of pu-@xmath126 disappears mainly due to the existing surface polarization with nonzero @xmath103 , which modifies the crystal symmetry of the oxide surface layer .",
    "for the ( 001 ) surface , since the surface layer of surf-1 slab model used in fig .",
    "5(d ) is not the stoichiometric puo@xmath0 but the ` pu - o ' , the insulating band gap further reduces to @xmath134ev , and a sharp peak of pu-@xmath126 state emerges below the fermi level , which implies the increase in the localized correlation of the pu-@xmath126 electronic state due to the presence of oxygen vacancies .",
    "these facts suggest that the surface effect of puo@xmath0 upon the electronic structure of the bulk phase appears to be insignificant for the stable ( 111 ) surface , to some extent significant for the ( 110 ) surface , and remarkable for the defect-(001 ) surface . in order to be able to theoretically reproduce the whole pes spectra of puo@xmath0 layers by the right description of the complex behavior of pu-@xmath126 state",
    ", there is clearly much left to be done .     as a function of the slab thickness : ( a ) puo@xmath0(111 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces , ( b ) the ideal ( 001 ) and the four defect-(001 ) surfaces . ]",
    "in addition to the pdos , we have also calculated the work function @xmath3 of low - index puo@xmath0 surfaces , and plotted them in fig .",
    "the work function @xmath3 is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface to the vacuum and can be written as @xmath135  @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the planar - averaged electrostatic potential in the middle of the vacuum and @xmath136 is the fermi energy of the system .",
    "therefore , work function is one fundamental physical quantity for the surface reactivity .",
    "furthermore , a modified or tunable @xmath3 can be useful for applications such as catalysis , because a slight change in the energy scale is exponentially amplified for chemical reactions .    from fig .",
    "6(a ) , one can see that the @xmath3 of stable ( 111 ) surface with an average value of @xmath138 ev ( gga+@xmath1 ) or @xmath139 ev ( lda+@xmath1 ) is much higher than that of the ( 110 ) surface with an average value of @xmath140 ev ( gga+@xmath1 ) or @xmath141 ev ( lda+@xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , for nonpolar surfaces , stable ( 111 ) surface will show its inertness in the surface chemical reactions , and the more open ( 110 ) surface is expected to be chemically active .",
    "figure 6(a ) also demonstrates the convergence behavior of @xmath3 as a function of the slab thickness . here",
    ", it is found that the gga+@xmath1 and lda+@xmath1 results of @xmath3 are in general agreement . for the stable ( 111 ) surface ,",
    "the work function shows less responsiveness to the thickness effect , as well as its surface energy @xmath52 in fig .",
    "on the contrary , both @xmath3 and @xmath52 of the ( 110 ) surface are sensitive to the slab thickness with a convergent oscillation . combining with the surface relaxation results given in fig .",
    "3(d ) , one can conclude that the thickness effect modifies both the surface stability and surface chemical activity through the structural relaxations .",
    "usually , the thickness of the oxide film formed on pu metal during stockpile process is typically of nanometer scale .",
    "thus , our present finding of thickness - selective surface activity may help to deepen the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms for the chemical reaction of small molecules ( such as water ) on oxidized pu surfaces , which is fundamental to the safety issue of nuclear industry .",
    "interestingly , a recent dft study @xcite has reported that the thickness effect of mgo film can be used to control the dissociation of water molecule on surface .",
    "for the case of the polar ( 001 ) surface shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) , the work function is mainly dominated by the strength of the anion - cation dipole , which impedes the escape of electrons .",
    "therefore , one can see that the work function of the ideal ( 001 ) surface is close to @xmath142 ev , which is much higher than that of the defect-(001 ) surfaces with an average value of @xmath143 ev .",
    "due to the significant influence of the existing dipole on the ( 001 ) surface , it is not reasonable to compare its surface chemical activity with ideal ( 110 ) or ( 111 ) non - polar surface merely via the surface work function .      in this section , we focus on the effect of o - vacancy with various concentrations upon the surface activity and surface relative stability by using the static gga+@xmath1 calculation and the approach of @xmath62 @xmath63 atomistic thermodynamics . here , our current study is mainly driven by the following motivations : ( i ) to explain the difference in the surface chemical activity between puo@xmath0 and @xmath144-pu@xmath0o@xmath9 , as mentioned in sec - i ; ( ii ) to discuss the mechanism of creating surface oxygen - vacancy in the cancelation of the polarity for puo@xmath0(001 ) surface ; and ( iii ) to explore the stable surface phase of puo@xmath0 in an oxidizing environment . amongst these listed issues , the o - vacancy is obviously the major factor .    in the calculation , to eliminate the thickness effect of the puo@xmath0 slab , we employ ( 111 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 001 ) slabs with @xmath145 , @xmath142 , and @xmath142 respectively .",
    "the various concentrations of oxygen vacancy ( @xmath5 ) are modeled by removing different amounts of oxygen atoms from ideal slabs with a series of surface unit cells . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the ratio between the number of o - vacancies and the total number of o atoms on the ideal surface layer .",
    "specifically , for the ( 111 ) surface , slabs of @xmath146 and @xmath147 unit cells are employed to create @xmath5 of @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 .",
    "for the ( 110 ) surface , slab of @xmath154 unit cells is used to create @xmath5 of @xmath155 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath153 .",
    "for the ( 001 ) surface , slab of @xmath156 unit cells can create @xmath5 of @xmath155 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath153 .    before the discussion on the evolution of work function as a function of @xmath5 , we first present the o - vacancy effect upon the structural relaxation of the ( 111 ) slab . the static calculation demonstrates that the ( 111 ) surface with on - surface o - vacancy is slightly preferred in total energy when @xmath1571/2 .",
    "however , when 1/2@xmath11@xmath1571 , the subsurface oxygen atoms , each of which sharing the same unit surface cell with one certain surface oxygen , will break through the above pu - terminated layer to form a complete o - terminated surface , leaving the subsurface o - vacancies at their former sites .",
    "therefore , when @xmath5@xmath21/2 , all the on - surface o - vacancies will convert to be the subsurface o - vacancies by a significant reconstruction .",

    "one can see from table i that for all three surfaces the work function will monotonically reduce with increasing cv .",
    "therefore , the introduction of o - vacancy can prominently enhance the surface chemical activity of non - polar ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces .",
    "for instance , the work function of the ideal ( 111 ) surface is @xmath4 ev , while a low @xmath5 = @xmath12 @xmath158 of on - surface o - vacancy can effectively depress the work function by @xmath159 @xmath160 ev and efficiently amplify the probability of the chemical reaction between the puo@xmath0(111 ) surface and other small gaseous molecules such as h@xmath0 and h@xmath0o , which will be investigated in our next work . this result can be also extended to explain the significant difference in the chemical activities between puo@xmath0 and @xmath144-pu@xmath0o@xmath9 , the latter has been found in experiment @xcite to be more active in interacting with small molecules .     of ( a ) puo@xmath0(111 ) , ( b ) ( 110 ) and ( c ) ( 001 ) surfaces with various concentrations of o - vacancy cv as a function of the oxygen chemical potential @xmath161 , with the corresponding pressure lines at t=300 k and t=600 k. the low - energy surface terminations are drawn with the thick lines in ( a)-(c ) , which are gathered in ( d ) with the ideal ( 111 ) surface as the reference configuration . ]    assuming that the puo@xmath0 surface is in equilibrium with an external oxygen environment and translating the oxygen chemical potential into temperature and pressure conditions according to eq .",
