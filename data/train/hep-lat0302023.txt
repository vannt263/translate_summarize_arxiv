    "is associated with the @xmath8 center of the gauge group . since the center symmetry is unbroken at low temperatures , an unbreakable string confines static quarks in the fundamental @xmath1 representation to static anti - quarks in the @xmath2 representation . in the high - temperature deconfined phase the polyakov loop",
    "@xcite gets a non - zero expectation value and the @xmath8 symmetry breaks spontaneously . as a result , there are three distinct deconfined phases",
    ". potential universal behavior at the deconfinement phase transition is described by an effective 3-d scalar field theory for the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "the center symmetry and its spontaneous breakdown were recently reviewed in @xcite . in full qcd the @xmath8 symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken because quarks transform non - trivially under the center . as a result ,",
    "the string connecting a quark and an anti - quark can break via the creation of dynamical quark - anti - quark pairs .",
    "still , color remains confined and non - abelian charged states  like single quarks or gluons  can not exist .    in this article",
    "we ask how confinement arises in a theory whose gauge group has a trivial center .",
    "the simplest group with this property is @xmath9 .",
    "while @xmath10 has a trivial center , its universal covering group @xmath11 has the non - trivial center @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , @xmath13 has a trivial center and the corresponding universal covering group @xmath14 has the non - trivial center @xmath15 .",
    "when one formulates yang - mills theories on the lattice , one usually works with wilson parallel transporters in the universal covering group @xmath14 .",
    "however , one can also work with parallel transporters taking values in the group @xmath13 .",
    "in that case , it is impossible to probe the gluon theory with static test quarks represented by polyakov loops in the fundamental representation of the gauge group .",
    "instead one is limited to purely gluonic observables .",
    "in fact , @xmath16 gauge theories have been studied in detail on the lattice @xcite .",
    "one finds that lattice artifacts  namely center monopoles  make it difficult to approach the continuum limit in this formulation . there is a phase transition in which the lattice theory sheds off these artifacts , and one then expects it to be equivalent to the standard @xmath11 yang - mills theory in the continuum limit .",
    "this suggests that it is best to formulate lattice gauge theories using the universal covering group , e.g. @xmath14 rather than @xmath13 , in order to avoid these lattice artifacts .",
    "the universal covering group of @xmath17 is @xmath18 which also has a non - trivial center : @xmath12 for odd @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "the center of the group @xmath24 is @xmath12 for all @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the universal covering groups of all main sequence lie groups have a non - trivial center .",
    "what about the exceptional groups ?",
    "interestingly , the groups @xmath0 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 have a trivial center and are their own universal covering groups .",
    "the groups @xmath27 and @xmath28 , on the other hand , have the non - trivial centers @xmath8 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the exceptional lie group @xmath0 is the simplest group whose universal covering group has a trivial center .",
    "the triviality of the center has profound consequences for the way in which confinement is realized .",
    "in particular , a static `` quark '' in the fundamental @xmath5 representation of @xmath0 can be screened by three @xmath0 `` gluons '' in the adjoint @xmath6 representation . as a result , in @xmath0 yang - mills theory",
    "the color flux string connecting two static @xmath0 `` quarks '' can break due to the creation of dynamical gluons .",
    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of full qcd ( with an @xmath4 color gauge group ) in which the string connecting a static quark and anti - quark can break due to the pair creation of light dynamical quarks . indeed , 6 of the 14 @xmath0 gluons transform as @xmath1 and @xmath2 under the @xmath4 subgroup of @xmath0 and thus qualitatively behave like dynamical quarks and anti - quarks . in particular",
    ", they explicitly break the @xmath8 center symmetry of the @xmath4 subgroup down to the trivial center of @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining @xmath29 @xmath0 `` gluons '' transform as @xmath3 under the @xmath4 subgroup and hence resemble the ordinary gluons familiar from qcd .",
    "it should be pointed out that  despite the broken string  just like full qcd , @xmath0 yang - mills theory is still expected to confine color . in particular , one does not expect colored states of single @xmath0 `` gluons '' in the physical spectrum .",
    "the triviality of the center of @xmath0 yang - mills theory also affects the physics at high temperatures . in particular , there is not necessarily a deconfinement phase transition , and we expect merely a crossover between a low - temperature `` glueball '' regime and a high - temperature @xmath0 `` gluon '' plasma . due to the triviality of the center , unlike e.g. for @xmath14 yang - mills theory , there is no qualitative difference between the low- and the high - temperature regimes because the polyakov loop is no longer a good order parameter .",
    "it is often being asked which degrees of freedom are responsible for confinement .",
    "popular candidates are dense instantons , merons , abelian monopoles and center vortices . center vortices ( and t hooft twist sectors ) are absent in @xmath0 gauge theories , while the other topological objects potentially exist , although their identification is a very subtle issue that often involves unsatisfactory gauge fixing procedures . at strong coupling @xmath0 lattice gauge theories",
    "still confine without a center .",
    "hence , center vortices should not be necessary to explain the absence of colored states in the physical spectrum @xcite .",
    "still , the center plays an important role for the finite temperature deconfinement phase transition in @xmath14 yang - mills theory , and center vortices may well be relevant for this physics .",
    "if @xmath0 yang - mills theory indeed has no finite temperature deconfinement phase transition , one might argue that this is due to the absence of center vortices and twist sectors .",
    "assuming that they can be properly defined , abelian monopoles are potentially present in @xmath0 gauge theory , and might be responsible for the absence of colored states . on the other hand , if  despite of the existence of abelian monopoles  a deconfinement phase transition does not exist in @xmath0 yang - mills theory , monopoles might not be responsible for the physics of deconfinement . in any case",
    ", quantifying these issues in a concrete way is a very difficult task .",
    "the exceptional confinement in @xmath0 gauge theory can be smoothly connected with the usual @xmath4 confinement by exploiting the higgs mechanism .",
    "when a scalar field in the fundamental @xmath5 representation of @xmath0 picks up a vacuum expectation value , the gauge symmetry breaks down to @xmath4 , and the 6 additional @xmath0 `` gluons '' become massive . by progressively increasing the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field",
    ", one can decouple those particles , thus smoothly interpolating between @xmath0 and @xmath4 gauge theories . in this way",
    ", we use @xmath0 gauge theories as a theoretical laboratory in which the @xmath4 theories we are most interested in are embedded in an unusual environment .",
    "this provides theoretical insight not only into the exceptional @xmath0 confinement , but also into the @xmath4 confinement that occurs in nature .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the center symmetry , the construction of the polyakov loop , and some subtle issues related to the physics of non - abelian gauge fields in a finite volume .",
    "some details of periodic and @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions are discussed in an appendix . in section 3",
    "we present the basic features of the exceptional group @xmath0 .",
    "section 4 contains the discussion of various field theories with gauge group @xmath0 . as a starting point",
    ", we consider @xmath0 yang - mills theory , which we then break to the @xmath4 subgroup using the higgs mechanism .",
    "we then add fermion fields in both the fundamental and the adjoint representation , thus arriving at @xmath0 qcd and supersymmetric @xmath0 yang - mills theory , respectively .",
    "in both cases , we concentrate on the chiral symmetries and we discuss how they are realized at low and at high temperature . in section 5 we substantiate the qualitative pictures painted in section 4 by performing strong coupling calculations in @xmath0 lattice gauge theory . in particular , we show that the theory confines although there is no string tension .",
    "finally , section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "when defined properly , the polyakov loop is a useful order parameter in yang - mills gauge theories with a non - trivial center symmetry , which distinguishes confinement at low temperatures from deconfinement at high temperatures . in particular ,",
    "the polyakov loop varies under non - trivial transformations in the center of the gauge group and it thus signals the spontaneous breakdown of the center symmetry at high temperatures . the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath31 measures the free energy @xmath32 of an external static test quark . in a confined phase with unbroken non - trivial center symmetry",
    "the free energy of a static quark is infinite .",
    "hence , @xmath33 and the center symmetry is unbroken . in a deconfined phase , on the other hand , @xmath32 is finite , @xmath34 , and the center symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the polyakov loop is a rather subtle observable whose definition needs special care . in particular , it is sensitive to spatial and temporal boundary conditions .",
    "for example , for a system of @xmath4 yang - mills gluons on a finite torus , the expectation value of the polyakov loop is always zero even in the deconfined phase @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath8 gauss law : a single static test quark can not exist in a periodic volume because its color flux can not go to infinity and must thus end in an anti - quark . due to the gauss law ,",
    "a torus is always neutral .",
    "since it always vanishes , on a finite torus the expectation value of the polyakov loop does not contain any useful information about confinement or deconfinement .",
    "still , using the polyakov loop , one can , for example , define its finite volume constraint effective potential , which does indeed allow one to distinguish confined from deconfined phases .",
    "let us consider a non - abelian yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath35 and anti - hermitean vector potential @xmath36 .",
    "the physics is invariant under non - abelian gauge transformations @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "we now put the system in a finite 4-dimensional rectangular space - time volume of size @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the extent in the spatial @xmath41-direction and @xmath42 is the extent of periodic euclidean time which determines the inverse temperature @xmath43 .",
    "we consider periodic boundary conditions in both space and euclidean time , such that our 4-dimensional space - time volume is a hyper - torus .",
    "this means that gauge - invariant physical quantities  but not the gauge - dependent vector potentials themselves  are periodic functions of space - time .",
    "the gauge fields themselves must be periodic only up to gauge transformations , i.e. @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the unit - vector in the @xmath46-direction and @xmath47 is a gauge transformation that relates the gauge field @xmath48 , shifted by a distance @xmath49 in the @xmath46-direction , to the unshifted gauge field @xmath36 .",
    "mathematically speaking , the @xmath47 define a universal fiber bundle of transition functions which glue the torus together at the boundaries .",
    "as explained in the appendix , the transition functions must obey the cocycle condition @xmath50 this consistency conditions contains the twist - tensor @xmath51 which takes values in the center of the gauge group .",
    "it should be noted that the transition functions @xmath47 are physical degrees of freedom of the non - abelian gauge field , just like the vector potentials @xmath36 themselves .",
    "in particular , in the path integral one must also integrate over the transition functions , otherwise gauge - variant unphysical quantities like @xmath36 itself might also become periodic . under general ( not necessarily periodic ) gauge transformations @xmath52 the transition functions",
    "transform as @xmath53 in lattice gauge theory the transition functions are nothing but the wilson parallel transporters on the links that connect two opposite sides of the periodic volume .",
    "the twist - tensor is gauge - invariant .",
    "hence , as was first pointed out by t hooft @xcite , non - abelian gauge fields on a torus fall into gauge equivalence classes characterized by the twist - tensor , which provides a gauge - invariant characterization of distinct superselection sectors .",
    "a non - trivial twist - tensor @xmath54 implies background electric or magnetic fluxes that wrap around the torus in various directions , while the sector with trivial twist @xmath55 describes a periodic world without electric or magnetic fluxes .",
    "it should be noted that one need not sum over the different twist - sectors in the path integral , because they correspond to distinct superselection sectors of the theory .",
    "interestingly , in a non - abelian yang - mills theory there is a symmetry transformation @xmath56 which leaves the boundary condition as well as the twist - tensor  and hence the superselection sector  invariant . here",
    "@xmath57 is an element of the center of the gauge group @xmath35 .",
    "this center symmetry exists only if all fields in the theory are center - blind .",
    "this is automatically the case for the gauge fields which transform in the adjoint representation .",
    "however , if there are fields that transform non - trivially under the center , the center symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "for example , a matter field that transforms as @xmath58 under gauge transformations , obeys the boundary condition @xmath59 which is gauge - covariant , but not invariant under the center symmetry of eq.([centersym ] ) .    based on the previous discussion , we are finally ready to attempt a first definition of the polyakov loop @xmath60,\\ ] ] which is invariant under the transformations of eq.([transition ] ) only because the transition function @xmath61 is included in its definition .",
    "then one obtains @xmath62   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\mbox{tr}[\\omega(\\vec x,\\beta ) \\omega_4(\\vec x,0 ) \\omega(\\vec x,0)^\\dagger \\omega(\\vec",
    "x,0 ) { \\cal p } \\exp(\\int_0^\\beta dt \\ a_4(\\vec x , t ) ) \\omega(\\vec x,\\beta)^\\dagger ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\phi(\\vec x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the center symmetry transformation of eq.([centersym ] ) the polyakov loop transforms as @xmath63 and thus it provides us with an order parameter for the spontaneous breakdown of the center symmetry . however , on a torus the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath64 always vanishes , simply because spontaneous symmetry breaking  in the sense of a non - vanishing order parameter  does not occur in a finite volume .",
    "alternatively , one may say that the expectation value of the polyakov loop always vanishes because the presence of a single static quark is incompatible with the gauss law on a torus .",
    "in any case , since it is always zero , on a finite torus the expectation value of the polyakov loop does not contain any information about confinement or deconfinement , or about how the center symmetry is dynamically realized .    still , even on a finite torus",
    "the polyakov loop can be used to define related quantities that indeed contain useful information about confinement versus deconfinement , and about the realization of the center symmetry .",
    "for example , one can define the finite volume ( @xmath65 ) constraint effective potential @xmath66 of the polyakov loop as @xmath67 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\exp(-s[a]),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 $ ] is the euclidean yang - mills action . in the confined phase , the constraint effective potential @xmath66 has its minimum at @xmath69 , while in the deconfined phase it has degenerate minima at @xmath70 which are related to one another by center symmetry transformations",
    ".    one may still not be satisfied with the previous definition of the polyakov loop .",
    "in particular , one may argue that the center symmetry transformations are part of the gauge group . in that case , the polyakov loop , as defined in eq.([polyakov ] ) , would simply be a gauge - variant unphysical quantity . in order to resurrect the polyakov loop from this deadly argument",
    ", we now discuss a space - time volume with @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions in the spatial directions .",
    "thermodynamics dictates that the boundary conditions in the euclidean time direction remain periodic .",
    "even the expectation value of the polyakov loop itself becomes a useful observable when @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions are used in @xmath4 yang - mills theory . in that case , a spatial shift by a distance @xmath40 is accompanied by a charge - conjugation transformation @xcite .",
    "a single static quark can exist in a @xmath30-periodic box because its color flux can end in a mirror anti - quark on the other side of the boundary . as a consequence ,",
    "the expectation value of the polyakov loop no longer vanishes automatically @xcite .",
    "in fact , it now vanishes only if one takes the infinite volume limit in the confined phase , while it remains non - zero in the deconfined phase .    in a @xmath30-periodic volume",
    "the physics is periodic up to a charge - conjugation twist , i.e. all physical quantities are replaced by their charge - conjugates when shifted by a distance @xmath40 in a spatial direction .",
    "of course , the gauge fields themselves are @xmath30-periodic only up to gauge transformations , i.e. @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the charge - conjugate of the gauge field @xmath36 .",
    "in the euclidean time direction we keep periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath73    as shown in the appendix , the cocycle conditions for @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions are given by @xmath74 and hence they differ from those for periodic boundary conditions . with @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions the transition functions transform under gauge transformations as @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the transpose .",
    "as we work out in the appendix , unlike for periodic boundary conditions , there are constraints on the twist - tensor itself .",
    "first @xmath77 and second @xmath78 interestingly , with @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions the twist - tensor is no longer invariant against the center symmetry transformations of eq.([centersym ] ) .",
    "one finds @xmath79 these relations can be used to relate gauge - equivalent twist - tensors to one another .",
    "first , let us assume that the center of the gauge group @xmath35 is @xmath15 with odd @xmath80 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath14 groups with odd @xmath80 as well as for @xmath27 which has the center @xmath8 .",
    "of course , the physical color gauge group @xmath4 with its center @xmath8 also falls in this class . in that case , in a @xmath30-periodic volume",
    "all twist - sectors are gauge - equivalent .",
    "in particular , using eq.([cetwist ] ) and putting the transformation parameter to @xmath81 one obtains @xmath82 for all @xmath41 .",
    "next , we put the transformation parameter @xmath83 and we choose @xmath84 such that @xmath85 , and @xmath86 such that @xmath87 . using the consistency condition eq.([cmtwist ] ) one finally obtains @xmath88 such that @xmath89 . hence , in this case the entire twist - tensor @xmath90 is trivial .",
    "consequently , for gauge groups with the center @xmath15 with odd @xmath80 there is only one @xmath30-periodic boundary condition .",
    "in other words , for @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions no analog of t hooft s electric and magnetic flux sectors exists  all twist - sectors are gauge - equivalent to the trivial one . in these cases , according to eq.([cetwist ] ) the twist - tensor element @xmath91 is independent of the spatial direction @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath80 is odd , its square - root in the center @xmath92 is uniquely defined ( without any sign - ambiguity ) . according to eq.([cgtwist ] )",
    "it transforms as @xmath93 under center transformations .",
    "this finally allows us to write down a completely gauge - invariant definition of the polyakov loop in a @xmath30-periodic volume @xmath94.\\ ] ] unlike for periodic boundary conditions , the center transformation of the transition function @xmath95 is now compensated by the variation of the square - root of the twist - tensor from eq.([cgsqrt ] ) and one obtains @xmath96 . defined in this completely gauge - invariant way , the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath31 indeed determines the free energy @xmath32 of a single static quark .",
    "in contrast to the periodic torus , a @xmath30-periodic volume can contain a single static quark , because the color flux string emanating from it can end in a charge - conjugate anti - quark on the other side of the boundary .",
    "the groups @xmath14 with even @xmath80 have a sign - ambiguity in the definition of the square - root of a center element . in that case",
    ", the expectation value of the polyakov loop vanishes even in a @xmath30-periodic volume .",
    "the same is true for @xmath18  the universal covering group of @xmath17  which has the center @xmath12 for odd @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath97 , and @xmath22 for @xmath98 , as well as for the symplectic groups @xmath24 and the exceptional group @xmath28 which both have the center @xmath12 . in those cases , one",
    "is limited to the construction of the finite volume constraint effective potential .",
    "the exceptional groups @xmath0 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 have a trivial center",
    ". then the polyakov loop is not an order parameter , but it can at least be defined without any problems even in a simple periodic volume .    keeping in mind the subtleties discussed above ,",
    "when we refer to the polyakov loop in the rest of this paper , strictly speaking , we mean the location of a minimum of its constraint effective potential on the torus , or its expectation value in a @xmath30-periodic box .",
    "both are identical in the infinite volume limit .",
    "in this section we discuss some basic properties of the lie group @xmath0  the simplest among the exceptional groups @xmath0 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath26  which do not fit into the main sequences @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath24 .",
    "while there is only one non - abelian compact lie algebra of rank 1  namely the one of @xmath101  there are four of rank 2 .",
    "these rank 2 algebras generate the groups @xmath0 , @xmath102 , @xmath4 and @xmath103 , which have 14 , 10 , 8 and 6 generators , respectively . for us",
    "the group @xmath0 is of particular interest because it has a trivial center and is its own universal covering group .",
    "as we will see later , this has interesting consequences for the confinement mechanism .",
    "it is natural to construct @xmath0 as a subgroup of @xmath104 which has rank 3 and 21 generators .",
    "the @xmath105 real orthogonal matrices @xmath106 of the group @xmath104 have determinant 1 and obey the constraint @xmath107 the @xmath0 subgroup contains those matrices that , in addition , satisfy the cubic constraint @xmath108 here @xmath76 is a totally anti - symmetric tensor whose non - zero elements follow by anti - symmetrization from @xmath109 the tensor @xmath76 also defines the multiplication rules for octonions @xcite .",
    "eq.([tensor ] ) implies that eq.([cubic ] ) represents 7 non - trivial constraints which reduce the 21 degrees of freedom of @xmath104 to the 14 parameters of @xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath0 inherits the reality properties of @xmath104 : all its representations are real .",
    "we make the following choice for the first 8 generators of @xmath0 in the 7-dimensional fundamental representation @xcite @xmath110 here @xmath111 ( with @xmath112 ) are the usual @xmath113 gell - mann generators of @xmath4 which indeed is a subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "we have chosen the standard normalization @xmath114 .",
    "the representation we have chosen involves complex numbers .",
    "however , it is unitarily equivalent to a representation that is entirely real . in the chosen basis of the generators it is manifest that under @xmath4 subgroup transformations the 7-dimensional representation decomposes into @xmath115 since @xmath0 has rank 2 , only two generators can be diagonalized simultaneously . in our choice of basis",
    "these are the @xmath4 subgroup generators @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "consequently , just as for @xmath4 , the weight diagrams of @xmath0 representations can be drawn in a 2-dimensional plane .",
    "for example , the weight diagram of the fundamental representation is shown in figure 1 .",
    "one notes that it is indeed a superposition of the weight diagrams of a @xmath1 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 in @xmath4 . since all @xmath0 representation are real , the @xmath5 representation is equivalent to its complex conjugate . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath0 `` quarks '' and `` anti - quarks '' are indistinguishable .",
    "in particular , a @xmath0 `` quark '' @xmath5 consists of an @xmath4 quark @xmath1 , an @xmath4 anti - quark @xmath2 and an @xmath4 singlet @xmath119 .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath120 contained in the @xmath5 of @xmath0 corresponds to a real reducible 6-dimensional representation of @xmath4 .    as usual ,",
    "@xmath121 define @xmath4 shift operations between the different states @xmath122 , @xmath123, ... ,@xmath124 in the fundamental representation .",
    "the remaining 6 generators of @xmath0 also define shifts @xmath125 the generators themselves transform under the 14-dimensional adjoint representation of @xmath0 whose weight diagram is shown in figure 2 .    from this diagram",
    "one sees that under an @xmath4 subgroup transformation the adjoint representation of @xmath0 decomposes into @xmath126 this implies that @xmath0 `` gluons '' @xmath6 consist of the usual @xmath4 gluons @xmath3 as well as of 6 additional `` gluons '' with @xmath4 quark and anti - quark color quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us now discuss the center of @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the maximal abelian ( cartan ) subgroup of both @xmath0 and @xmath4 is @xmath127 which must contain the center in both cases .",
    "since @xmath0 contains @xmath4 as a subgroup its center can not be bigger than @xmath8 ( the center of @xmath4 ) because the potential center elements of @xmath0 must commute with all @xmath0 matrices ( not just with the elements of the @xmath4 subgroup ) . in the fundamental representation of @xmath0",
    "the center elements of the @xmath4 subgroup are given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the @xmath130 unit matrix and @xmath131 is an element of @xmath8 . by construction ,",
    "the three @xmath105 matrices @xmath132 commute with the 8 generators of the @xmath4 subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "however , an explicit calculation shows that this is not the case for the remaining 6 generators .",
    "consequently , the center of @xmath0 is trivial and contains only the identity .",
    "the above argument applies to any representation of @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "the universal covering group of @xmath0 is @xmath0 itself and still it has a trivial center .",
    "as we will see , this has drastic consequences for confinement .",
    "in particular , the string between static @xmath0 `` quarks '' can break already in the pure gauge theory through the creation of dynamical `` gluons '' .    in @xmath4",
    "the non - trivial center @xmath8 gives rise to the concept of triality .",
    "for example , the trivial representation @xmath119 and the adjoint representation @xmath3 of @xmath4 have trivial triality , while the fundamental @xmath1 and anti - fundamental @xmath2 have non - trivial opposite trialities .",
    "since its center is trivial , the concept of triality does not extend to @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , as one can see from eqs.([dec7],[dec14 ] ) , @xmath0 representations decompose into mixtures of @xmath4 representations with different trialities .",
    "this has interesting consequences for the results of @xmath0 tensor decompositions @xcite .",
    "for example , in contrast to the @xmath4 case , the product of two fundamental representations @xmath133 contains both the trivial and the adjoint representation .",
    "the @xmath119 and @xmath134 representations are symmetric under the exchange of the two @xmath5 representations , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are anti - symmetric . as a result of eq.([prod77 ] ) , already two @xmath0 `` quarks '' can form a color - singlet . just as for @xmath4 ,",
    "three @xmath0 `` quarks '' can form a color - singlet `` baryon '' because @xmath135 another interesting example is @xmath136 as a consequence of the absence of triality , the decomposition of the tensor product of three adjoint representations contains the fundamental representation .",
    "this means that three @xmath0 `` gluons '' @xmath35 can screen a single @xmath0 `` quark '' @xmath137 , and thus a color - singlet hybrid @xmath138 can be formed .",
    "later we will also need the results for further tensor product decompositions , two of which are listed here @xmath139    it is also interesting to consider the homotopy groups related to @xmath0 because this tells us what kind of topological excitations can arise . as for @xmath4 ,",
    "the third homotopy group of @xmath0 is @xmath140 = { { \\sf z \\!\\!\\ !",

    "interestingly , in contrast to @xmath4 , for @xmath0 which has a trivial center @xmath144 the first homotopy group @xmath145 = \\pi_0[i ] = \\{0\\}\\ ] ] is trivial .",
    "hence , even in the pure gauge theory non - trivial twist - sectors do not exit .",
    "in this section we discuss various theories with gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "we start with pure yang - mills theory and then add charged matter fields in various representations .",
    "for example , we consider a scalar higgs field in the fundamental representation which breaks @xmath0 down to @xmath4 . by varying the vacuum expectation value of",
    "the higgs field one can interpolate between a @xmath0 and an @xmath4 gauge theory .",
    "we also add majorana `` quarks '' first in the fundamental @xmath5 representation and then also in the adjoint @xmath6 representation .",
    "the former theory is closely related to @xmath4 qcd , while the latter corresponds to @xmath146 supersymmetric @xmath0 yang - mills theory .",
    "let us first consider the simplest @xmath0 gauge theory  @xmath0 yang - mills theory .",
    "since @xmath0 has 14 generators there are 14 `` gluons '' . under the subgroup @xmath4 8 of them",
    "transform as ordinary gluons , i.e. as an @xmath3 of @xmath4 .",
    "the remaining 6 @xmath0 gauge bosons break - up into @xmath1 and @xmath118 , i.e. they have the color quantum numbers of ordinary quarks and anti - quarks . of course , in contrast to real quarks , these objects are bosons with spin 1 . still , these additional 6 `` gluons '' have somewhat similar effects as quarks in full qcd .",
    "in particular , they explicitly break the @xmath8 center symmetry of @xmath4 and make the center symmetry of @xmath0 yang - mills theory trivial .",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath0 yang - mills theory takes the standard form @xmath147 = \\frac{1}{2 g^2 } \\mbox{tr } f_{\\mu\\nu } f_{\\mu\\nu},\\ ] ] where the field strength @xmath148,\\ ] ] is derived from the vector potential @xmath149 the lagrangian is invariant under non - abelian gauge transformations @xmath150 where @xmath151 . like all non - abelian pure gauge theories , @xmath0 yang - mills theory is asymptotically free .",
    "complementary to this , at low energies one expects confinement .",
    "however , in contrast to @xmath4 yang - mills theory , the triviality of the @xmath0 center has far reaching consequences for how confinement is realized .",
    "in particular , as we have already seen in eq.([product ] ) , an external static `` quark '' in the fundamental @xmath5 representation can be screened by at least three `` gluons '' .",
    "hence , via creation of dynamical `` gluons '' the confining string connecting two static @xmath0 `` quarks '' can break and the potential flattens off .",
    "hence , the string tension  as the ultimate slope of the heavy `` quark '' potential at distance @xmath152  vanishes .",
    "thus , in contrast to @xmath4 yang - mills theory where gluons can not screen quarks , there is a more subtle form of confinement in @xmath0 yang - mills theory , very much like the confinement in @xmath4 qcd . in the qcd case screening",
    "arises due to dynamical quark - anti - quark pair creation , and again the confining string breaks .",
    "thus , @xmath0 pure yang - mills theory provides us with a suitable theoretical laboratory to investigate confinement without facing additional complications due to dynamical fermions . in the next section the issue of @xmath0 string breaking",
    "will be studied in the strong coupling limit of lattice gauge theory .    of course",
    ", unless one proves confinement analytically , one can not be sure that qcd , @xmath0 yang - mills theory , or any other gauge theory is indeed in the confined phase in the continuum limit . based on general wisdom",
    ", one would certainly expect that @xmath0 gauge theory confines color in the same way as qcd .",
    "in particular , we do not expect it to be in a massless non - abelian coulomb phase .",
    "an order parameter that distinguishes between a confined phase ( without a string tension , however , with color screening ) and a coulomb phase has been constructed by fredenhagen and marcu @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will show that @xmath0 lattice yang - mills theory is indeed in the confined phase in the strong coupling limit .",
    "due to the triviality of the center one also expects unusual behavior of @xmath0 yang - mills theory at finite temperature . in @xmath14 yang - mills theory",
    "there is a deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature where the @xmath15 center symmetry gets spontaneously broken . for two colors ( @xmath153 ) the deconfinement phase transition is second order @xcite and belongs to the universality class of the 3-d ising model @xcite . for @xmath154 , on the other hand , the phase transition is first order @xcite and the bulk physics is not universal .",
    "this is consistent with what one expects based on the behavior of the 3-d 3-state potts model @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature deconfined phase of @xmath14 yang - mills theory is characterized by a non - zero value of the polyakov loop order parameter and by a vanishing string tension .",
    "on the other hand , in the low - temperature confined phase , the polyakov loop vanishes and the string tension is non - zero . as we have seen before , already in the confined phase of",
    "@xmath0 yang - mills theory the string tension is zero .",
    "since for @xmath0 the center is trivial , the polyakov loop no longer vanishes in the confined phase and it is hence no longer an order parameter for deconfinement . as a result ,",
    "for @xmath0 there is no compelling argument for a phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "in particular , a second order phase transition is practically excluded due to the absence of a symmetry that could break spontaneously .",
    "even without an underlying symmetry , a second order phase transition can occur as an endpoint of a line of first order transitions .",
    "however , these particular cases require fine - tuning of some parameter and can thus be practically excluded in @xmath0 yang - mills theory . on the other hand",
    ", one can not rule out a first order phase transition because this does not require spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "since the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath4 yang - mills theory is already rather weakly first order , we expect the @xmath0 yang - mills theory to have only a crossover from a low- to a high - temperature regime . in qcd",
    "dynamical quarks also break the @xmath8 center symmetry explicitly . as the quark masses",
    "are decreased starting from infinity , the first order phase transition of the pure gauge theory persists until it terminates at a critical point and then turns into a crossover @xcite .",
    "of course , in the chiral limit there is an exact chiral symmetry that is spontaneously broken at low and restored at high temperatures .",
    "hence , one expects a finite temperature chiral phase transition which should be second order for two and first order for three massless flavors @xcite .",
    "a second order chiral phase transition will be washed out to a crossover once non - zero quark masses are included . in @xmath0 yang - mills theory there is no chiral symmetry that could provide us with an order parameter for a finite temperature phase transition .      in the next step",
    "we add a higgs field in the fundamental @xmath5 representation in order to break @xmath0 spontaneously down to @xmath4 .",
    "then 6 of the 14 @xmath0 `` gluons '' pick up a mass proportional to the vacuum value @xmath155 of the higgs field , while the remaining 8 @xmath4 gluons are unaffected by the higgs mechanism and are confined inside glueballs . for large @xmath155",
    "the theory thus reduces to @xmath4 yang - mills theory . for small @xmath155 ( on the order of @xmath156 ) , on the other hand , the additional @xmath0 `` gluons '' are light and participate in the dynamics .",
    "finally , for @xmath157 the higgs mechanism disappears and we arrive at @xmath0 yang - mills theory .",
    "hence , by varying @xmath155 one can interpolate smoothly between @xmath0 and @xmath4 yang - mills theory and connect the exceptional @xmath0 confinement with the usual confinement in @xmath4 .",
    "the lagrangian of the @xmath0 gauge - higgs model is given by @xmath158 = { \\cal l}_{ym}[a ] + \\frac{1}{2 } d_\\mu \\phi d_\\mu \\phi +   v(\\phi).\\ ] ] here @xmath159 is the real - valued higgs field , @xmath160 is the covariant derivative and @xmath161 is the scalar potential .",
    "we have seen in eq.([prod ] ) that the tensor product @xmath162 contains a singlet .",
    "hence , one might also expect a cubic term @xmath163 in the lagrangian .",

    "theoretical context this phenomenon has been explained in @xcite . just like other topological excitations , such as monopoles , cosmic strings and vortices ,",
    "a supersymmetric domain wall has the unbroken symmetry phase in its core .",
    "consequently , inside the wall ( as well as inside the string ) the chiral @xmath238 symmetry is restored .",
    "interestingly , the restoration of @xmath238 induces the spontaneous breakdown of the center symmetry @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the core of a supersymmetric domain wall is in the deconfined phase .",
    "when a confining string enters the wall the color flux that it carries spreads out and the string ends .    as one increases the temperature , a transition to a deconfined phase with restored chiral symmetry occurs . as usual , in the deconfined phase the @xmath8 center symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "when a confined - confined domain wall is heated up to the phase transition , the deconfined phase in its core expands and forms a complete wetting layer whose width diverges at the phase transition @xcite . due to the broken @xmath8 center symmetry",
    "there are also three distinct deconfined phases .",
    "when those coexist , they are separated by deconfined - deconfined domain walls .",
    "as the phase transition is approached from above , similarly , a deconfined - deconfined domain wall splits into a pair of confined - deconfined interfaces and its core turns into a complete wetting layer of confined phase @xcite .",
    "let us now ask how the situation is modified for @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory for which the center is trivial . interestingly , the remnant chiral symmetry is enhanced to @xmath242 which breaks spontaneously to @xmath205 . as a result ,",
    "similar to the @xmath4 case , there are now four different low - temperature chirally broken phases which are characterized by the @xmath7 phase @xmath243 of the `` gluino '' condensate . due to the triviality of the center",
    ", we have the exceptional confinement with a breakable string that we have already discussed in the non - supersymmetric @xmath0 yang - mills theory .",
    "when two distinct chirally broken phases coexist , they are again separated by a domain wall .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath4 case , @xmath0 strings can not only end on such walls because they can break and thus end anywhere .",
    "when @xmath0 `` gluons '' and `` gluinos '' are heated up , their chiral symmetry is restored in a finite temperature phase transition .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 pure yang - mills theory , a phase transition must exist because there is now an exact spontaneously broken @xmath7 chiral symmetry for which the `` gluino '' condensate provides us with an order parameter . as another consequence of the triviality of the center , there is only one high - temperature chirally symmetric phase .",
    "in particular , deconfined - deconfined domain walls do not exist . however , there are now two types of domain walls in the low - temperature phase .",
    "a wall of type i separates chirally broken phases whose `` gluino '' condensates are related by a @xmath7 transformation @xmath244 , while for a wall of type ii the phases are related by a @xmath245-rotation .",
    "the chiral phase transition may be first or second order . in the latter case",
    "the low- and high - temperature phases do not coexist at the phase transition and complete wetting does not arise .",
    "however , we find it more natural to expect a first order phase transition .",
    "for example , the deconfinement phase transition of an ordinary @xmath246 yang - mills theory , which has a @xmath22 center symmetry , is first order @xcite .",
    "if the chiral phase transition of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory is first order as well , the low- and high - temperature phases coexist and complete wetting may arise . when a wall of type i is heated up to the phase transition , we expect it to split into a pair of interfaces with a complete wetting layer of chirally symmetric phase in between .",
    "it is less clear if complete wetting would also occur for domain walls of type ii .",
    "we do not enter this discussion here . in any case ,",
    "complete wetting is no longer needed for strings to end on the walls .",
    "in order to substantiate some of the claims made in the previous sections we now formulate @xmath0 yang - mills theory on the lattice and derive some analytic results in the strong coupling limit . as usual , such results do not directly apply to the continuum limit and should ultimately be extended by monte carlo simulations into the weak coupling continuum regime .",
    "still , assuming that there is no phase transition separating the strong from the weak coupling regime , the strong coupling results provide insight into dynamical behavior  such as confinement  which persists in the continuum limit .",

    "on the other hand , we expect static `` quarks '' to be screened by `` gluons '' and hence the string to break . as a result ,",
    "the static `` quark '' potential levels off and large wilson loops obey a perimeter law .    in the strong coupling regime @xmath262 , and @xmath263",
    "can be used as a small expansion parameter .",
    "the first step of the strong coupling expansion is the character expansion of the boltzmann factor for an individual plaquette @xmath264 where @xmath265 is a generic representation of the gauge group and the corresponding character @xmath266 is the trace of the matrix @xmath267 in that representation .",
    "the coefficients @xmath268 enter the strong coupling expansion as power - series in @xmath263 .",
    "for example , for @xmath0 we have @xmath269    let us now compute the expectation value of a rectangular wilson loop of size @xmath270 in the strong coupling limit . in @xmath14 lattice",
    "yang - mills theory the leading contribution in the strong coupling expansion results from tiling the rectangular surface enclosed by the wilson loop with @xmath270 elementary plaquettes in the fundamental representation .",
    "this gives rise to the strong coupling area law .",
    "all higher order contributions amount to deformations of this minimal surface of plaquettes .",
    "such contributions are also present for @xmath0 . however , in the @xmath0 case there are additional terms arising from a tube of plaquettes along the perimeter of the wilson loop .",
    "in fact , these contributions dominate at large @xmath257 and give rise to a strong coupling perimeter law . for small @xmath257 , on the other hand ,",
    "the surface term dominates and yields a linearly rising potential at short distances .",
    "it should be noted that tube contributions arise even in @xmath14 yang - mills theory for wilson loops of adjoint charges . in that case",
    ", there is again no linearly rising confinement potential . due to the triviality of the center , for @xmath0",
    "the perimeter law arises already for fundamental charges .    here",
    "we consider only the leading contribution to the strong coupling expansion . for small @xmath271",
    "the surface term dominates and gives @xmath272 which yields a linear potential @xmath273 in an @xmath14 yang - mills theory the linear potential would extend to arbitrary distances and @xmath274 would play the role of the string tension . in the @xmath0 case , however , the large @xmath275 behavior is dominated by the perimeter term @xmath276 which gives rise to a flat ( @xmath257-independent ) potential @xmath277 at distances larger than @xmath278 the perimeter term overwhelms the surface term and the string breaks . hence , there is no confinement in the sense of a non - vanishing string tension characterizing the slope of the potential at asymptotic distances .",
    "when one pulls apart a @xmath0 `` quark '' pair beyond the distance @xmath279 , `` gluons '' pop up from the vacuum and screen the fundamental color charges of the `` quarks '' .",
    "this is possible only because @xmath0 has a trivial center . from the tensor product decomposition of eq.([product ] ) one infers that at least three `` gluons '' ( which are in the @xmath6 of @xmath0 ) are needed to screen a single `` quark '' ( in the @xmath5 of @xmath0 ) .",
    "since its string can break , pure @xmath0 yang - mills theory resembles full qcd . in that case ,",
    "dynamical quark - anti - quark pairs materialize from the vacuum to screen an external static quark - anti - quark pair at large separation .",
    "hence , also in full qcd the static quark - anti - quark potential flattens off and ultimately there is no string tension . of course",
    ", this does not mean that qcd does not confine .",
    "in particular , there should be no single quark or gluon states in the physical spectrum , i.e. qcd should not be realized in a non - abelian coulomb phase .",
    "an order parameter that distinguishes between coulomb and confinement phases ( even if there is no string tension ) has been constructed by fredenhagen and marcu @xcite .",
    "this order parameter can also be adapted to @xmath0 pure yang - mills theory and can , in fact , be evaluated in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the fredenhagen - marcu order parameter is a ratio of two expectation values .",
    "the numerator consists of parallel transporters along an open staple - shaped path connecting a source and a sink of color flux and the denominator is the square root of a closed wilson loop @xmath280 the open path symbolic object in the numerator stands for @xmath281 \\mbox{tr}(u_{\\box_y}^\\dagger \\lambda_b),\\ ] ] where @xmath282 is a path - ordered product of parallel transporters along the open path @xmath283 .",
    "this staple - shaped path of time - extent @xmath76 connects the source and sink points @xmath284 and @xmath285 that are spatially separated by a distance @xmath257 . at these points dynamical @xmath0 `` gluons '' are created by plaquette operators @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "the factors @xmath288 and @xmath289 reflect the fact that `` gluons '' transform in the adjoint representation .",
    "the closed path symbolic object in the denominator is a wilson loop of size @xmath290 in the adjoint representation .",
    "the fredenhagen - marcu order parameter describes the creation of a pair of adjoint dynamical charges that propagate for a time @xmath76 and measures their overlap with the vacuum in the limit @xmath291 . in a coulomb phase",
    "charged states exist in the physical spectrum and are orthogonal to the vacuum .",
    "consequently , the fredenhagen - marcu vacuum overlap order parameter then vanishes . in a confined phase , on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical charges are screened and @xmath292 goes to a non - zero constant for large @xmath257 and @xmath76 .    in the strong coupling limit",
    "the leading contribution to the numerator of the vacuum overlap order parameter is a tube of plaquettes emanating from the source plaquette @xmath293 , following the staple - shaped path , and ending at the sink plaquette @xmath294 .",
    "this leads to a perimeter law in the numerator .",
    "just like the wilson loop in the fundamental representation that was calculated before , the adjoint wilson loop in the denominator of the order parameter also obeys a perimeter law . due to the square root and the doubled temporal extent ,",
    "the perimeter behavior in the numerator and the denominator cancel exactly and one is left with @xmath295 here the plane of the plaquettes @xmath293 and @xmath294 is dual to the plane of the staple - shaped path @xmath283 .",
    "eq.([fredord ] ) shows that we are indeed in a confined phase ( without a string tension , however , with color charge screening ) and not in a non - abelian coulomb phase .",
    "of course , this strong coupling result does not guarantee that @xmath0 yang - mills theory confines also in the continuum limit , as one would naturally expect .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate this issue in numerical simulations .",
    "one might argue that in a pure gluon theory quarks are simply not present and can hence not even be used as external static sources . if one wants to study confinement of gluons without using static quarks , one can use the vacuum overlap operator also in an @xmath4 yang - mills theory . in the strong coupling limit one then finds again that gluons are in a confined phase with color screening by dynamical gluon creation  and are not in a coulomb phase .",
    "it should be noted that the fredenhagen - marcu order parameter makes sense only at zero temperature , because it requires to take the limit @xmath296 . since @xmath0 has a trivial center ( and thus a vanishing string tension ) there is no need for the standard finite temperature deconfinement phase transition . in particular",
    ", there is no center symmetry that could break spontaneously at high temperatures .",
    "of course , this argument does not exclude the existence of a first order phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "we find it more natural to expect just a crossover .",
    "again , this is an interesting point for numerical investigation . in any case , analytic strong coupling calculations can not answer this question .",
    "we have compared qualitative non - perturbative features such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in theories with @xmath0 and @xmath4 gauge groups . in particular , we have exploited the higgs mechanism ( induced by a scalar field in the @xmath5 representation of @xmath0 ) in order to interpolate smoothly between these two cases . we have focused on effects which are intimately related to the center of the gauge group , and which hence are qualitatively different for @xmath4 with center @xmath8 and @xmath0 with a trivial center .",
    "when all dynamical fields in an @xmath4 gauge theory are center - blind ( such as gluons or gluinos which have trivial triality ) the @xmath8 center is an exact symmetry . infinitely heavy quarks with non - trivial triality can be used as external probes of the gluon dynamics that provide information about how the @xmath8 symmetry is realized . in a confined phase with intact center symmetry the confining string connecting a static quark - anti - quark pair is absolutely unbreakable and has a non - zero string tension that characterizes the interaction at arbitrarily large distances .",
    "the string tension can vanish only when the center gets spontaneously broken , which is indeed unavoidable at high temperatures .",
    "then the euclidean time extent is short and the gauge field configuration becomes almost static . as a consequence ,",
    "the polyakov loop order parameter becomes non - zero .",
    "hence , the exact center symmetry provides us with an argument for the existence of a deconfinement phase transition .",
    "if the transition is second order , universality arguments suggest that it is in the universality class of a 3-d center - symmetric scalar field theory for the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath153 it is second order @xcite and falls in the universality class of the 3-d ising model @xcite .",
    "since it has a trivial center , the concept of triality does not extend to @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , any infinitely heavy external source can be screened by dynamical `` gluons '' and thus the string always breaks at large distances through the creation of dynamical `` gluons '' . as a result",
    ", the string tension ultimately vanishes .",
    "however , a strong coupling lattice study of the fredenhagen - marcu vacuum overlap order parameter shows that the theory is still confining  i.e. no colored states exist in the spectrum .",
    "confinement without a ( fundamental ) string tension is indeed exceptional for a pure gauge theory .",
    "it only arises for the exceptional lie groups @xmath0 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . as another consequence of the trivial center ,",
    "the @xmath0 polyakov loop is no longer an order parameter .",
    "hence , in contrast to @xmath14 yang - mills theory , for @xmath0 there is no compelling reason for a finite temperature deconfinement phase transition .",
    "we can not exclude a first order phase transition but we expect only a crossover .",
    "clearly , the triviality of the center implies less predictive power about a possible phase transition .",
    "once dynamical fields with non - trivial triality ( such as light quarks ) are included in an @xmath4 gauge theory , they break the center symmetry explicitly . as a result ,",
    "the string connecting a static quark - anti - quark pair can now break through pair creation of dynamical quarks and the string tension ultimately vanishes .",
    "again , the fredenhagen - marcu order parameter still signals confinement .",
    "in addition , the polyakov loop is no longer a good order parameter . from this point of view",
    ", the confinement in @xmath0 yang - mills theory resembles the one of @xmath4 qcd , and hence , it is not so exceptional after all .",
    "again , by using the higgs mechanism , we have also interpolated between @xmath0 and @xmath4 gauge theories with massless dynamical fermions , both in the fundamental and in the adjoint representation . in many of these cases",
    ", there is a non - trivial chiral symmetry that breaks spontaneously at low temperatures .",
    "since the @xmath0 representations are real , we have considered @xmath187 flavors of majorana fermions .",
    "the chiral symmetry then is @xmath297 which breaks spontaneously to @xmath298 .",
    "it is interesting how this pattern of symmetry breaking turns into the breaking of @xmath224 to @xmath225 that occurs in qcd .",
    "as we have seen , there are many interesting non - perturbative phenomena that arise in @xmath0 gauge theories . despite the fact that nature chose not to use @xmath0 ( at least at presently accessible energies ) it may be of theoretical interest to study @xmath0 gauge theories more quantitatively .",
    "lattice gauge theory provides us with a powerful tool for such investigations .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to check if the strong coupling confined phase extends to the continuum limit , by measuring the fredenhagen - marcu order parameter in a numerical simulation . with lattice methods one can also decide if the low- and high - temperature regimes in @xmath0 yang - mills theory are separated by a first order phase transition or just by a crossover .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate yang - mills theories with other gauge groups such as @xmath24 , which have a @xmath12 center symmetry .",
    "if they have a second order deconfinement phase transition , one expects it to be in the universality class of the 3-d ising model .",
    "a numerical study of @xmath299 gauge theory is presently in progress @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath299 with 10 generators is the fourth of the rank 2 lie groups besides @xmath300 , @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "based on its rank and its number of generators one might expect that it should behave more like @xmath4 than like @xmath301 .",
    "however , as in the @xmath11 case , we find that @xmath299 yang - mills theory has a second order deconfinement phase transition with 3-d ising critical exponents .    in conclusion , we have used @xmath0 gauge theories as a theoretical laboratory to study @xmath4 theories in an unusual environment . in particular , the embedding of @xmath4 in @xmath0 with its trivial center forces us to think about confinement without the luxury of the @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "as one would expect , confinement itself works perfectly well without the center symmetry .",
    "however , in its absence we loose predictive power about a possible phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "we like to thank s.  caracciolo , p.  de  forcrand , r.  ferrari , o.  jahn , j.  kuti and a.  smilga for interesting discussions .",
    "this work is supported by the doe under the grant doe - fg03 - 97er40546 , by the schweizerischer nationalfond , as well as by the european community s human potential program under the grant hprn - ct-2000 - 00145 hadrons / lattice qcd , bbw nr .",
    "in this appendix we derive some relations for periodic and @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions that are used in section 2 .",
    "first , we consider periodic boundary conditions . shifting the gauge field in two orthogonal directions @xmath45 and @xmath302 , on the one hand , one obtains @xmath303 on the other hand , by performing the two shifts in the opposite order , one finds @xmath304 the two results are consistent only if the transition functions obey the cocycle condition eq.([cocycle ] ) .",
    "eq.([transition ] ) guarantees gauge - covariance of the boundary condition , i.e. @xmath305 interestingly , the gauge transformed cocycle condition takes the form @xmath306 consequently , @xmath307 , i.e. the twist - tensor is gauge invariant .",
    "next , we consider @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions . as",
    "before , we shift the gauge field in two orthogonal directions .",
    "first , we pick two different spatial directions @xmath41 and @xmath308 , and we obtain @xmath309 performing the two shifts in the opposite order , one now finds @xmath310 the two results are consistent only if the transition functions obey the first cocycle condition of eq.([ccocycle ] ) .",
    "next , we pick the spatial @xmath41-direction and the euclidean time direction , such that @xmath311 again , performing the two shifts in the opposite order we obtain @xmath312 in this case , the resulting cocycle condition is the second one of eq.([ccocycle ] ) .",
    "eq.([ctransition ] ) ensures the gauge - covariance of @xmath30-periodic boundary condition , i.e. @xmath313 let us consider the gauge transformed cocycle condition @xmath314 hence , @xmath315 , i.e. the twist - tensor is invariant under the transformations of eq.([ctransition ] ) .",
    "similarly , we obtain @xmath316 such that @xmath317 .",
    "interestingly , with @xmath30-periodic boundary conditions there are further consistency conditions besides the cocycle condition eq.([ccocycle ] ) .",
    "for example , on the one hand , one has @xmath318 while , on the other hand , @xmath319 hence , unlike for periodic boundary conditions , there is the constraint of eq.([cmtwist ] ) , @xmath320 , on the twist - tensor itself .",
    "similarly , if one shifts in two spatial directions as well as in the euclidean time direction , on the one hand , one finds @xmath321 while , on the other hand , @xmath322 consequently , one also obtains eq.([cetwist ] ) , @xmath323 .      a.  m.  polyakov , phys .  lett .",
