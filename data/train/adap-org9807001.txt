    "overdamped brownian motion in a field of force ( markov process ) is a model widely used for description of noise - induced transitions in different polystable systems . in many practical tasks ( e.g. tasks of josephson electronics , kinetics of chemical reactions and so on )",
    "it is enough to know the probability of transition or even only a time scale of transition .",
    "when the transition occurs over a potential barrier high enough in comparison with noise intensity , the probability of transition is a simple exponent @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the mean transition time . in this case",
    "the mean transition time gives complete information about the probability evolution .",
    "the boundaries of validity of exponential approximation of the probability were previously studied in @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite authors extended the mean first passage time to the case of `` radiation '' boundary condition and for two barrierless examples demonstrated good coincidence between exponential approximation and numerically obtained probability . in a more general case the exponential behavior of observables",
    "was demonstrated in @xcite for relaxation processes in systems having steady states . using the approach of `` generalized moment approximation '' the authors of @xcite obtained the exact mean relaxation time to steady state and for particular example of a rectangular potential well demonstrated good coincidence of exponential approximation with numerically obtained observables .",
    "the considered in @xcite example of the rectangular well does not have a potential barrier , and the authors of that paper supposed that their approach ( and the corresponding formulas ) should also give good approximation in tasks with diffusive barrier crossing for a wide range of noise intensity .    in the frame of this paper",
    "we consider a different case than in @xcite,@xcite : we present investigation of nondecay probability of a metastable state .",
    "we treat the decay as a transition of markov process trajectory outside the region of a metastable state .",
    "we consider namely the probability to find a relization of markov process in a given interval , but not the probability to pass the boundary for the first time ( first passage time formalizm ) , since usually in experiment we can measure only the first one . in",
    "most of applied tasks no absorbing boundaries can be introduced and the precision of the used equipment allows to register the only fact of leaving the considered domain , but the boundary may be crossed many times during the transition ( infinite number of times for markov process , since this process is not differentiable ) .    using the approach proposed by malakhov @xcite,@xcite , that requires only knowledge of the behavior of a potential at @xmath2 , we have decomposed the nondecay probability into a set of moments ( cumulants ) , obtained recurrent formulas for these moments and approximately summarized them into the required probability .",
    "the obtained nondecay probability demonstrates exponential behavior with a good precision even in the case of a small potential barrier in comparison with noise intensity .",
    "consider a process of brownian diffusion in a potential profile @xmath3 .",
    "let a coordinate @xmath4 of the brownian particle described by the probability density @xmath5 at initial instant of time has a fixed value @xmath6 within the interval @xmath7 , i.e. the initial probability density is the delta function : @xmath8 , @xmath9 .    in this case",
    "the one - dimensional probability density @xmath5 is the transition probability density from the point @xmath10 to the point @xmath11 : @xmath12 .",
    "it is known that the probability density @xmath5 of the brownian particle in the overdamped limit satisfies to the fokker ",
    "planck equation ( fpe ) : @xmath13 + { \\partial^2w(x , t)\\over\\partial x^2}\\right\\}. & & \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the delta - shaped initial distribution .",
    "here @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the probability current , @xmath16 is the viscosity ( in computer simulations we put @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 is the temperature , @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath20 is the dimensionless potential profile . in this paper we restrict ourselves by the case of metastable potentials , i.e. we consider an overdamped brownian motion in a potential field @xmath21 in systems , having metastable states , such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to the following boundary conditions : @xmath24 .",
    "note , that the results obtained may be generalized for potentials of arbitrary types , e.g. for such that @xmath25 .",
    "it is necessary to find the probability @xmath26 of a brownian particle , located at the point @xmath10 ( @xmath27 ) within the interval ( @xmath28 ) to be at the time @xmath29 inside the considered interval : @xmath30 .",
    "further we for simplicity will call the probability @xmath26 as nondecay probability",
    ". we suppose , that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are arbitrary chosen points of an arbitrary potential profile @xmath33 and boundary conditions at these points may be arbitrary : @xmath34 , @xmath35 . in this case",
    "there is the possibility for a brownian particle to come back in the interval ( @xmath28 ) after crossing boundary points .",
    "consider the nondecay probability @xmath26 .",
    "we can decompose this probability to the set of moments . on the other hand ,",
    "if we know all moments , we can in some cases construct a probability as the set of moments .",
    "thus , analogically to moments of the first passage time @xcite-@xcite we can introduce moments of decay time @xmath36 ( or , generally , moments of transition time , see @xcite , where it was performed for the probability @xmath37 ) : @xmath38    here we can formally denote the derivative of the probability divided by the normalization factor as @xmath39 and thus introduce the probability density of decay time @xmath39 in the following way @xcite : @xmath40}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is important to mention that the moments of decay ( transition ) time ( [ 3 ] ) is a generalization of the well - known moments of the first passage time for the case of arbitrary boundary conditions ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the considered case of the potential @xmath21 ( such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) the moments of decay time coincide with the corresponding moments of the first passage time , if a reflecting boundary at the point @xmath31 and an absorbing boundary at the point @xmath32 are introduced . on the other hand , if we consider the decay of metastable state as transition over a barrier top , and compare mean decay time obtained via approach discussed in the present paper ( case of a smooth potential without absorbing boundary ) and the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) of the absorbing boundary located at the barrier top , we get two times difference between these time characteristics even in the case of a high potential barrier in comparison with the noise intensity .",
    "this is due to the fact , that the mfpt does not take into account the backward probability current and therefore is sensitive to the location of an absorbing boundary . for the considered situation ,",
    "if we will move the boundary point down from the barrier top , the mfpt will increase up to two times and tend to reach value of the corresponding mean decay time , which is less sensitive to the location of the boundary point over a barrier top .",
    "such weak dependence of the mean decay time from the location of the boundary point at the barrier top or further is intuitively obvious : much more time should be spent to reach the barrier top ( activated escape ) than to move down from the barrier top ( dynamic motion ) .",
    "the required moments of decay time may be obtained via the approach proposed by malakhov @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the laplace transformation method of the fpe ( [ 2 ] ) . following this approach",
    ", one can introduce the function @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the laplace transformation of the probability current , and expand it in the power series in @xmath43 : @xmath44    it is possible to find the differential equations for @xmath45 ( see @xcite,@xcite ; @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 using the boundary conditions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , one can obtain from ( [ a3 ] ) @xmath50 and    @xmath51    why did we calculate this recurrent formula for the functions @xmath45 ? the matter is , that from formula ( [ 3 ] ) ( taking the integral by parts and laplace transforming it using the property @xmath52 together with the expansion ( [ a1 ] ) ) one can get the following expressions for moments of decay time : @xmath53    one can represent the @xmath54-th moment in the following form :    @xmath55    this is a natural representation of @xmath36 due to the structure of recurrent formulas ( [ rec ] ) , which is seen from the particular form of the first and the second moments for the case @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) . from the recurrent formulas ( [ rec ] ) , ( [ t ] ) one can obtain : @xmath58 @xmath59 ^ 2\\right.+\\nonumber \\\\ + \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^d e^{-\\varphi(x)}dx\\cdot \\int\\limits_{x_0}^{\\infty } e^{\\varphi(v ) } \\int\\limits_{d}^{v } e^{-\\varphi(u ) } \\int\\limits_{u}^{\\infty } e^{\\varphi(z)}dzdudv- \\label{t2}\\\\ -\\left.\\int\\limits_{x_0}^{d } e^{-\\varphi(x ) } \\int\\limits_{x_0}^x e^{\\varphi(v ) } \\int\\limits_{d}^{v } e^{-\\varphi(u ) } \\int\\limits_{u}^{\\infty } e^{\\varphi(z)}dzdudvdx\\right\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the approach , applied in the paper by shenoy and agarwal @xcite for analysis of moments of the first passage time , it can be demonstrated , that in the limit of a high barrier @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the dimensionless barrier height ) the remainders @xmath62 in formula ( [ 9 ] ) may be neglected . for @xmath63 , however , a rigorous analysis should be performed for estimation of @xmath62 .",
    "let us suppose , that the remainders @xmath62 may be neglected in wide range of parameters and further we will check numerically when our assumption is valid .",
    "the cumulants of decay time @xmath64 @xcite,@xcite are much more useful for our purpose to construct the probability @xmath26 , that is the integral transformation of the introduced probability density of decay time @xmath39 ( [ 2a ] ) . unlike the representation via moments , the fourier transformation of the probability density ( [ 2a ] ) - the characteristic function - decomposed into the set of cumulants may be inversely transformed into the probability density .",
    "analogically to representation for moments ( [ 9 ] ) , similar representation can be obtained for cumulants @xmath64 : @xmath65 it is known that the characteristic function @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) can be represented as the set of cumulants ( @xmath68 for @xmath69 ) : @xmath70.\\ ] ]    in the case , when the remainders @xmath71 in ( [ 10 ] ) ( or @xmath62 in ( [ 9 ] ) ) may be neglected , the set ( [ char ] ) may be summarized and inverse fourier transformed : @xmath72 where @xmath1 is the mean decay time @xcite,@xcite ( @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 this expression is a direct transformation of formula ( [ t1 ] ) , where @xmath31 is arbitrary , such that @xmath57 .    probably , similar procedure was previously used ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) for summation of the set of moments of the first passage time , when exponential distribution of the first passage time probability density was demonstrated for the case of a high potential barrier in comparison with noise intensity .",
    "integrating probability density ( [ 11 ] ) , taking into account definition ( [ 2a ] ) , we get the following expression for the nondecay probability @xmath26 ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) : @xmath77 where mean decay time @xmath1 is expressed by ( [ tau ] ) . probability ( [ pr ] ) represents a well - known exponential decay of a metastable state with a high potential barrier @xcite . where is the boundary of validity of formula ( [ pr ] ) and when can we neglect by reminders @xmath78 and @xmath79 in formulas ( [ 9]),([10 ] ) ? to answer this question we have considered three examples of potentials having metastable states and compared numerically obtained nondecay probability @xmath30 with its exponential approximation ( [ pr ] ) .",
    "we used the usual explicit difference scheme to solve the fpe ( [ 3 ] ) , supposing the reflecting boundary condition @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) far above the potential minimum and the absorbing one @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) far below the potential maximum , instead of boundary conditions at @xmath2 , such that the influence of phantom boundaries at @xmath84 and @xmath85 on the process of diffusion was negligible .",
    "the first considered system is described by the potential @xmath86 .",
    "we have taken the following particular parameters : @xmath87 , @xmath88 that leads to the barrier height @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding curves of the numerically simulated probability and its exponential approximation are presented in fig.1 . in the worse case",
    "when @xmath93 the maximal difference between the corresponding curves is @xmath94 . for comparison ,",
    "there is also presented a curve of exponential approximation with the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) of the point @xmath32 for @xmath93 ( dashed line ) .",
    "one can see , that in the latter case the error is significantly larger .",
    "the second considered system is described by the potential @xmath95 .",
    "we have taken the following particular parameters : @xmath96 , @xmath97 that leads to the barrier height @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding curves of the numerically simulated probability and its exponential approximation are presented in fig.2 . in the worse case ( @xmath93 )",
    "the maximal difference between the corresponding curves is @xmath101 .",
    "the third considered system is described by the potential @xmath102 .",
    "this potential is multistable .",
    "we have considered it in the interval @xmath103 $ ] , taking into account three neighboring minima .",
    "we have taken @xmath104 that leads to the barrier height @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "the corresponding curves of the numerically simulated probability and its exponential approximation are presented in fig.3 . in difference with two previous examples ,",
    "this potential was considered in essentially longer interval and with smaller barrier .",
    "the difference between curves of the numerically simulated probability and its exponential approximation is larger .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative coincidence is good enough .",
    "finally , we have considered an example of metastable state without potential barrier : @xmath110 , where @xmath88 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . by dashed curve",
    "an exponential approximation with the mfpt of the point @xmath32 for @xmath93 is presented .",
    "it is seen , that even for such example the exponential approximation ( with the mean decay time ( [ tau ] ) ) gives an adequate description of the probability evolution and that this approximation works better for larger noise intensity .",
    "in the present paper the decay of metastable states , described by the model of markov process , has been considered .",
    "recurrent formulas of exact moments of decay time , valid for arbitrary noise intensity , have been obtained .",
    "some concrete examples of metastable states have been analysed numerically , and the time evolution of the nondecay probability of a metastable state is found to be really close to the exponent even for the case when the potential barrier height is comparable or smaller than the noise intensity if the exact mean decay time ( [ tau ] ) is substituted into the factor of exponent .",
    "for all investigated examples , the exponential approximation gives an adequate behavior of the probability .",
    "this approximation may be used in a wide range of parameters , enough for solution of many practical tasks , but it is necessary to remark , that the exponential approximation may lead to a significant error in the case of extremely large noise intensity , and in the case when the noise intensity is small , the potential is tilted , and the barrier is absent ( purely dynamical motion slightly modulated by noise perturbations ) .",
