    "non - abelian chern - simons theory is an example of a three - dimensional topological theory .",
    "it has been argued that radiative corrections in the theory serve only to displace the coupling constant , despite the fact that the gauge fixing term that must be appended to the classical lagrangian is metric dependent @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a number of ( but not all ) perturbative calculations , each of which requires some form of regularization @xcite . regulating this model",
    "is complicated by the three dimensional nature of the tensor @xmath3 occurring in the initial lagrangian , and by the fact that the theory is topological - it is difficult to respect these properties if one regulates by altering the initial lagrangian in some way .",
    "( for example , addition of a yang - mills term to the chern - simons lagrangian @xcite , while rendering the theory super - renormalizable , does not respect its topological nature and simple pauli - villars regularization @xcite breaks the brs invariance of the tree - level effective action.@xcite ) a way of circumventing this difficulty is to use a variant of operator regularization @xcite ; in this approach the initial lagrangian is not modified - rather , the operators occurring in the closed form expression for the generating functional are regulated .",
    "at one loop order , one encounters a functional determinant @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath5 is linear in the derivative operator , operator regularization can not be applied directly ; one must instead consider @xmath6 .",
    "however these two expressions may not be equal - a phase associated with @xmath4 may be lost if @xmath5 has negative eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "this phase may be determined by considering the so - called @xmath7-function @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the contribution of the @xmath7-function to @xmath4 is consistent with the expectations of @xcite , and that this result is independent of the gauge fixing parameter @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite it has been demonstrated that if operator regularization is used to evaluate the contribution of the two - point function to @xmath6 ( associated with modulus of @xmath4 ) then a result proportional to @xmath8 is obtained .",
    "this respects the gauge invariance of the theory , but clearly is not topological in character .",
    "this computation was performed in the so - called landau - honerkamp gauge .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the computation of @xcite by including a gauge parameter @xmath0 ( with the landau gauge recovered in the @xmath9 limit ) .",
    "operator regularization can not be used as in @xcite when @xmath10 due to the form of @xmath6 ; however a simple modification of the procedure ( explained below ) allows us to circumvent the difficulties which occur .",
    "it is found that the two - point contribution to @xmath6 is in fact dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "the form of these terms has not been anticipated @xcite as the gauge parameter @xmath0 is dimensionful ; they are proportional to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we now give the details of the calculation , demonstrate consistency with an extension of the brs identities ( known as the nielsen identities ) , and then show that to one - loop order there may be non - vanishing contributions to the vacuum expectation value of a product of wilson loops that are of order  @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider the classical chern - simons lagrangian @xmath13 if @xmath14 ( for some integer @xmath15 ) then ( [ e1 ] ) describes a topological quantum field theory which is invariant under gauge transformations of arbitrary winding number .",
    "we add to it the gauge - fixing lagrangian @xmath16 where @xmath17 has been split into the sum of classical background field @xmath18 and a quantum field @xmath19@xcite , and @xmath20 .",
    "( note that in ( 2 ) @xmath0 is dimensionful . )",
    "the ghost lagrangian associated with ( 2 ) is @xmath21 as this is independent of @xmath0 , its contribution to the one - loop generating functional was computed in @xcite and need not be considered further .",
    "usually the smooth limit to the landau - honerkamp gauge requires that a first order gauge fixing formalism be used : i.e. ( [ e2 ] ) being replaced by @xmath22 the landau - honerkamp gauge is obtained now by simply setting @xmath0 to zero ( as was done in @xcite ) .",
    "however , when we retain @xmath0 non - zero throughout the calculations , the gauge fixing terms ( [ e4 ] ) make the computations prohibitively difficult .",
    "for this reason we choose to work with the gauge fixing lagrangian ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "the contribution to the one - loop generating functional coming from ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) is given by @xmath23 unfortunately , the factor @xmath24 is not in a form that is appropriate for applying operator regularization @xcite directly to  ( [ e5 ] ) . the appropriate procedure in this case @xcite is to examine separately the modulus and phase of @xmath25 .",
    "the phase calculation , for arbitrary @xmath0 has been computed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we now concentrate on the contribution from the modulus , i.e. we examine    @xmath26    a perturbative expansion of @xmath27 can be developed if we first partition @xmath28 into the sum @xmath29 where @xmath30 contains all the dependence on the background field @xmath31 , and secondly use the schwinger expansion @xcite @xmath32 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we are interested in the two point function we need only retain terms which are second order in the background field @xmath31 .    from ( [ e6 ] ) we see that @xmath33 \\;\\ ; , \\ ; ( p \\equiv -i   \\partial)\\ ] ] so that @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",

    "all contributions to the two - point function which are eventually proportional to tadpole integrals have been dropped in ( [ e14 ] ) .    by using ( [ e13 ] ) , ( [ e14 ] ) can be converted into a sum of integrals in which the argument of the exponential occurring in each integrand is just @xmath64\\tau$ ] , allowing us to use the standard integrals to compute @xmath65 , as was done in the examples given in @xcite .",
    "some tedious calculation leaves us with the result @xmath66 this is transverse , as is required by gauge invariance , but is manifestly dependent on both the metric and gauge parameter @xmath0 .",
    "neither of the terms dependent on @xmath0 have been anticipated @xcite .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 occurs in the transverse direction in ( [ e16 ] ) , which is unlike what occurs in yang - mills theory where gauge - parameter dependence is confined to the unphysical longitudinal sector of the vector field .",
    "this does not imply that the propagation of physical degrees of freedom depends on an arbitrary parameter , as the pure chern - simons theory in fact has no dynamical content !",
    "we now turn to the nielsen identities to test the consistency of our expression for @xmath67 .",
    "much as the ward - takahashi and slavnov - taylor identities arise from considering the brs symmetry of the lagrangian , one obtains the nielsen identities @xcite by extending this symmetry to include variations in the gauge parameter . in doing",
    "so we are able to obtain relations between the variation of the gauge parameter in a given green s function with their product of other green s functions ( e.g. @xmath68 ) .",
    "the relevant nielsen identity for @xmath67 will be derived and the other green s functions arising in the identity will be calculated .",
    "we will then show that the @xmath0-dependence in ( [ e16 ] ) is consistent with this identity .    in the background field formalism the full lagrangian for a non - abelian gauge field ( including all sources ) @xcite",
    "is given by    @xmath69    where @xmath70 and other group indices have been suppressed .",
    "the lagrangian is invariant under the usual brs transformations :    @xmath71    where @xmath43 is a global grassmann parameter . by adding the following term parametrized by the global grassmann variable @xmath72 ( which does not alter the dynamics ) to the lagrangian    @xmath73    the new lagrangian is invariant under the following extended set of brs transformations  @xcite @xmath74 the generating functional is @xmath75 \\ ,   e ^ {   -\\int d^3x \\left ( { \\cal",

    "@xmath78 is invariant in the following manner @xmath79 note that integration over coordinate space is understood .",
    "the quantum fields here are not the ones which originally appear in the lagrangian but rather the legendre transform fields ( i.e. vacuum expectation values of the lagrangian fields ) which appear in the proper generating functional .",
    "thus the brs variations in terms of the these fields are not necessarily given by ( [ variations ] ) but may be expressed in terms of derivatives with respect to the sources ( this can be shown to hold for composite fields as well ) . also , for the particular green s functions we will want to obtain , we may choose to set @xmath80 ( i.e. @xmath81 ) .",

    "ghost number conservation then implies that all but the following terms vanish , @xmath86 we may now set @xmath87 and differentiate the two remaining terms with respect to @xmath88 and @xmath89 to obtain @xmath90 there is a contribution from neither @xmath91 nor from @xmath92 as these terms have a single uncontracted group index and @xmath78 is invariant in group space .",
    "thus we are left with the _ nielsen identity _ @xmath93",

    "in fact , the identity  ( [ nielsenid ] ) can be checked at one - loop order without having to calculate radiative corrections to @xmath95 .",
    "we thus turn our attention to the calculation of one - loop contributions to @xmath96 , pictured in figure  [ figoneloop ] .",

    "in the section  [ proper2point ] we derived the existence of gauge - parameter dependence in the two - point correlation @xmath116 .",
    "although these terms do not seem to have appeared before in the literature , we should not be too surprised by their existence since , as shown section  [ nielsenidentities ] , this dependence is just a consequence of the brs variation of operator @xmath117 .",

    "it is well known in quantum field theory that composite quantum fields require special regularization over and above any regularization of the elementary fields ( see for example collins @xcite ) .",
    "although , these coincident contributions do not introduce any further divergences into the expectation value of @xmath125 $ ] ( owing to the zero - measure of the region over which they contribute ) they do serve to destroy the topological properties which are enjoyed by @xmath125 $ ] at the classical level .",
    "it is thus found that , while the expectation values of cross - terms between the various elements of the link in ( [ wilsonlink ] ) have an _ a priori _ well - defined topological meaning , the _ self - interacting _ terms ( those involving more than one power on the gauge - connection on any given knot ) do not .    the solution which is typically proposed is as follows .",
    "instead of thinking of a given knot @xmath126 as a 1-manifold , we can allow them to have a slightly extended structure : that of a ribbon , @xmath127 as shown in figure  [ ribbon ]",
    ". this construction ( referred to as _ framing _ ) has been used extensively @xcite to give topological meaning to the wilson line operator which will thus depend on the topological structure of the ribbon .    at this point",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this latter equation @xmath184 is the ghost field of the brs multiplet and the vacuum expectation value @xmath185 refers to the matrix element in the presence of a single operator insertion @xmath186 ( analogous to equation  ( [ chi ] ) ) .",
    "equation  ( [ gaugedependence ] ) follows from taking @xmath187 of ( [ invariantgamma ] ) with vanishing background field provided that we identify @xmath78 with the vacuum expectation value of the framed wilson loop of  ( [ framedwilsonloop ] ) .",
    "whether @xmath188 \\rangle$ ] generally vanishes in the @xmath174 limit is unclear to us , but appears to be worth further consideration .",
    "in this paper we have calculated part of the two - point function in pure non - abelian chern - simons theory .",
    "the remaining parts of the two point function have been computed before , namely the @xmath0-independent contribution from the ghost lagrangian to the modulus @xmath27 @xcite and the contribution from the phase of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the result which we have obtained clearly indicates that this two point function is _ both _ gauge _ and _ metric dependent .",
    "this is in contrast to the result in @xcite where topological arguments were used to argue that radiative effects serve only to shift the coupling constant .",
    "the metric dependence of the two point function was noted previously @xcite where the computation was carried out in the landau - honerkamp gauge ( i.e. @xmath0 = 0 ) using operator regularization .",
    "the result of this paper is , to our knowledge , the first indication of gauge dependence in this two point function .",
    "the regularization procedure can not be held responsible for this dependence as it has not been necessary to explicitly introduce any regulating parameter into the lagrangian .",
    "indeed , the dependence on the gauge parameter has been shown to be consistent with the nielsen identities in section  [ nielsenidentities ] , above .",
    "the relationship between the vacuum expectation value of wilson line operators and the n - point correlation functions has been explored in @xcite .",
    "the discussion there is simplified as these authors , by using a regulating technique which does not respect brs symmetry in the tree level effective action @xcite , find that there are no radiative corrections to the two and three point functions up to two - loop order ( and hence that radiative corrections do not shift the coupling constant , as anticipated in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the effect of including the radiative corrections found in @xcite and in equation  ( [ e16 ] ) above on the vacuum expectations value of framed wilson line operators has , in the preceding section , been shown to give a possible contribution of order @xmath0 .",
    "this is clearly a problem worth pursuing .",
    "we note that operator regularization , which is very similar to the techniques employed above , has been used to demonstrate the absence of any need to renormalize chern - simons theory at two - loop order when @xmath189 @xcite .",
