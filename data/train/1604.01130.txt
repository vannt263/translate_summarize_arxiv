    "the majority of the systems that are frequently encountered in all aspects of our everyday life ; describing technological , environmental , financial and social processes are characterized by considerable size and significant complexity . in the technical world , contemporary industrial processes are composed by a large number of spatially distributed feedback modules with heterogeneous sensors , actuators and controllers that exchange information over a band - limited communication network that is embedded to the system .",
    "these systems are characterized as large - scale networked control systems and can be found in many real - life applications such as : telecommunication networks , water distribution systems , traffic networks , power systems , multi - vehicle formations to name a few .",
    "every system is susceptible to faults that may lead to catastrophic failures .",
    "complex processes are significantly more vulnerable to faults , since a malfunction in a single component may have a major effect to the entire system .",
    "there is a growing need for reliable real - time monitoring and supervision especially in the case of safety - critical systems .",
    "the broad objective is to design fault tolerant systems that maintain their operation even in the occurrence of faults .",
    "a timely diagnosis of a fault mode may improve the system s availability and maintainability by avoiding down - times , breakdowns and catastrophic failures .",
    "fault diagnosis has received considerable attention since the 1970s .",
    "most of the existing techniques involve a centralized architecture @xcite , where a single diagnostic module is responsible of receiving , and processing all the information measured by the sensors .",
    "this architecture is appropriate for small and centralized systems , however , it is ill - suited for large - scale systems with spatially distributed components .",
    "every monitoring system has certain limitations in terms of computational power and communication bandwidth . when the dimensionality and complexity of the system increases , it is likely that these limitations will not be satisfied by a centralized configuration .",
    "it is of great importance to express the formulation of fault diagnosis in a non - centralized way , making it applicable to real - life large - scale systems @xcite .",
    "existing methodologies interchange different types of data between their detecting nodes such as : state estimates @xcite , raw measurements of the interconnected states @xcite , or fault signatures @xcite .",
    "the first distributed fault diagnosis approach using particle filtering was introduced in @xcite . in general",
    ", the majority of the existing distributed techniques are designed for discrete - event systems @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present a full - order distributed particle filtering fault diagnosis ( dpffd ) algorithm for large - scale nonlinear / non - gaussian systems .",
    "the design objective is to develop a network of interconnected detector nodes ( dns ) to monitor a stochastic nonlinear process that is subject to a set of active fault modes .",
    "the dns should detect distributively the occurrence of a fault by computing the probability of failure of each mode .",
    "each dn has access to a partial and noisy measurement of the system s state and to processed statistical information from its neighboring nodes .",
    "it consists of an embedded processing unit that computes a local pf algorithm and a consensus filter that fuses the processed information of neighboring dns such that the entire detecting system reaches an agreement of its estimates .",
    "graph - based abstractions will be used to represent the active communication channels between the nodes .",
    "the output of the detection network is a filtered estimate of the process state and a probability of failure for each fault mode .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : a brief description of the centralized particle filtering algorithm is presented in section [ sec : centralized - particle - filtering ] .",
    "a centralized particle filtering fault diagnosis approach is analytically introduced in section [ sec : centralized - particle - filtering-1 ] . in section [ sec : distributed - particle - filtering ] the dpffd algorithm is derived .",
    "the performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated in section [ sec : numerical - results ] via numerical simulations . finally , concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the filtering problem is formulated based on the discrete time state - space approach .",
    "the main concept is to estimate the system s state by using a sequence of noisy measurements .",
    "it is assumed that the system s measurements are available at every discrete time instant .",
    "the state estimation should take place recursively as the measurements are received .",
    "consider a time - dependent , state vector @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the time index .",
    "the state - transition model of the state @xmath2 is defined according to : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a known , nonlinear function , and @xmath5 stands for the system s noise . at time",
    "step @xmath6 , the observation equation is expressed by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the measurement vector , @xmath9 is a known nonlinear function , and @xmath10 stands for the measurement noise .",
    "it is assumed that both the system noise @xmath11 and the measurement noise @xmath12 are white and independent .    in real life applications , most systems are nonlinear and driven by non - gaussian noise . as a result , optimal filters such as the kalman filter ( kf ) and its derivatives become ill - suited . particle filters ( pfs )",
    "is an alternative to the kalman approach , that is suitable to nonlinear problems .",
    "the pf is a sequential bayesian estimator that utilizes monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "this approach enables us to represent the non - gaussian posterior probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath13 by a set of @xmath14 randomly drawn particles @xmath15 and their corresponding weights @xmath16 .",
    "based on this representation , the posterior can have the following discrete approximation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes to the multivariate delta function . a way to mitigate the inability to directly sample from a posterior distribution",
    "is to apply the methodology of sequential importance sampling ( sis ) .",
    "this technique allows the computation of a distribution using random samples that are drawn from another .",
    "the particles @xmath19 are drawn from an importance density function ( proposal pdf ) @xmath20 .",
    "their corresponding weights @xmath21 , are sequentially calculated involving the likelihood function according to : @xmath22 filtering via sis takes place by recursively updating the importance weighs @xmath23 and the particles @xmath24 as new measurements @xmath25 become available .",
    "the most basic form of the pf algorithm is the sequential importance resampling filter ( sir ) .",
    "the most popular sir algorithm is the bootstrap filter that uses the state - transition density @xmath26 as the importance pdf . in this case",
    ", the update weight equation simplifies to @xmath27 .",
    "the particles will degenerate rapidly since the transition prior is not conditioned on the measurement data .",
    "the transition prior @xmath26 is a broader distribution than the likelihood @xmath28 , thus , only a few particles are assigned with a high weight .",
    "the performance of the algorithm will deteriorate rapidly and especially when the measurement noise is small . in order to make the sis simulation - based techniques viable , the _ resampling _ method of particles",
    "is adopted .",
    "the fundamental idea behind resampling is to preserve particles with large weights while discarding those with small weights .",
    "more about resampling techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "the schematic of the bootstrap filter is depicted in figure [ fig : schematic - of - pf ] .     ]",
    "this section presents a centralized particle filtering fault detection ( cpffd ) algorithm for nonlinear and non - gaussian stochastic nonlinear processes . in this work we extent the methodology reported in @xcite from simple one dimensional fault - growth models to state - space representations of generic nonlinear systems .",
    "the main objective of the cpffd methodology is to provide an estimate of the system s state by a noisy measurements sequence ( filtering ) , and generate a statistical characterization of the fault mode that can trigger fault alarms .",
    "consider the uncertain , nonlinear and discrete - time dynamic system @xmath29 , described by the following state - space model : @xmath30 where the terms @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 refer to the state , input and measurement vector , respectively ; @xmath34 , and @xmath35 denote the known nonlinear functions of healthy and measurement dynamics of the system , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 stand for the system and measurement noise with appropriate dimensions , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath38 refer to @xmath39 potential fault modes where the nonlinear function @xmath40 represents the dynamic of fault mode @xmath41 .",
    "the term @xmath42 is a scalar function representing the time profile of the fault occurrence that takes place at some unknown time @xmath43 . here",
    ", we can consider both types of faults : _ abrupt _ ( step - like ) or _ incipient _ ( exponential - like ) faults , described by : @xmath44 the algorithm incorporates the process model of ( [ eq : state space model ] ) , as well as a binary state vector , to detect changes in the process dynamics expressed by the terms @xmath42 . to this end",
    ", a vector of binary states @xmath45^{t}$ ] with @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 , is used to signal the occurrence of each fault mode .",
    "more specifically , @xmath48 indicates that the system is operating normally , while @xmath49 denotes the presence of fault mode @xmath41 in the system .",
    "this technique enables us to calculate probabilistic measures related to the existence of a fault in the system .    to determine the operating condition of the system ( normal or faulty operating condition ) and make a decision based on occurrence of faults",
    ", a particle filtering approach will be employed for a statistical characterization of both the binary and continuous - valued states , as new measurements are received .",
    "the binary states update sequence is augmented to the state - transition model @xmath29 given in ( [ eq : evolution of continuous state ] ) .",
    "this way , the state - transition model of system @xmath29 is converted to a _ failure sensitive filter _ that reflects the presence of changes to the original healthy dynamics .",
    "hence , the state vector that is used by the pf algorithm is @xmath50 \\in \\mathbb{r } ^{n_{x}+2 \\cdot m}$ ] , where @xmath51 .",
    "the state - space model of the system that is implemented in the pf algorithm can be expressed in terms of the continuous states vector , and the binary states vector .",
    "therefore , the state - transition model of these two state vectors and the measurement equation can be written as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are the approximations of non - gaussian process and measurement noise with appropriate dimensions , respectively .",
    "these noise sequences should be as close as possible to the actual ones ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "the evolution of the binary states @xmath55^{t},[1\\;0]^{t}\\}$ ] , is a nonlinear function driven by the identically independent distributed ( i.i.d ) uniform white noise @xmath56 .",
    "the function @xmath57 is defined such that the previous state @xmath58 is randomly excited at each time step by @xmath59 .",
    "this random vector of @xmath60 is assigned to ones of the binary states ( healthy / faulty ) based on the distance metric of the perturbed vector @xmath61 to the coordinates @xmath62^{t}$ ] and @xmath63^{t}$ ] . with this technique ,",
    "when a fault occurs , the weights will gradually converge the binary state @xmath64 to one ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the likelihood of the measurements will diminish the weights of particles associated with the healthy condition .",
    "a choice of @xmath57 that has been successfully used in @xcite is : @xmath66 where @xmath67^{t}$ ] and @xmath68^{t}$ ] .",
    "the state model of the cpffd algorithm can be written in a more compact form as : @xmath69 where @xmath70^{t}$ ] , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 are nonlinear functions of appropriate dimensions and structure calculating based on ( [ eq : evolution of continuous state ] ) .",
    "the above definition will be used to ease the notation in the subsequent parts of this paper .",
    "the outputs of the cpffd module are the _ probabilities of each failure mode_. these are the expectations of the binary states @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "this value is used to trigger alarm indicators if its value exceeds a certain threshold @xmath75 that marks the probability of detection ( i.e. @xmath76 indicates normal operation ) . with this layout two or more different co",
    "- existing fault modes can be simultaneously detected .",
    "the cpffd algorithm described in the previous section is not scalable or robust for complex large - scale dynamical systems that employ scattered measurement sensors over large geographical regions .    ]    here , we propose a distributed particle filtering fault diagnosis ( dpffd ) algorithm for large - scale nonlinear / non - gaussian systems .",
    "the main objective is to develop a network of interconnected detector nodes ( dns ) to monitor the full - order system that is subject to a set of active fault modes .",
    "figure [ fig : proposed - distributed - fault ] indicates the block diagram of the proposed distributed approach . similar to section [ sec : centralized - particle - filtering ] , we assume the presence of @xmath39 potential fault modes in system @xmath29 ( [ eq : state space model ] ) .",
    "a network of @xmath77 dns is deployed to monitor the full - order system .",
    "the local measurement equation of each of which is expressed by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 refers to the observation vector of dn @xmath80 ; the nonlinear function @xmath81 indicates the local measurement dynamics , and @xmath82 stands for its corresponding measurement noise .",
    "analogously to ( [ eq : compact - form ] ) , a compact formulation of the state - transition model that is used by the local pf module at each dn can be written as : @xmath83 where @xmath84 ; @xmath72 is calculated according to ( [ eq : evolution of continuous state ] ) , and @xmath85 is a nonlinear function that represents the local measurement dynamic ( [ eq : local measurement model-1 ] ) .",
    "it is reminded that @xmath86 includes both the continuous system s states vector @xmath87 as well as the binary states vector @xmath88^{t}\\ : j=1,\\ldots , m$ ] .",
    "as mentioned , the goal of the dpffd algorithm is to estimate the full system s state @xmath89 in a sequential manner and diagnose distributively the occurrence of the fault modes based on the local measurement vector of each dn .",
    "graph - based abstractions will be used to represent the active communication channels between the nodes .",
    "the communication network will be described by the graph @xmath90 , defined as the pair @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the vertex set or dns set , and @xmath93 represents the set of edges of @xmath90 .",
    "each element of @xmath94 represents an undirected communication link between two dns .",
    "the neighborhood @xmath95 of the vertex @xmath96 is defined as the set of all vertices that are adjacent to @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "if @xmath98 , it follows that @xmath99 , since an undirected edge exists between them .    the algorithm is performed in several steps at each dn in parallel with other neighboring nodes .",
    "each dn executes a local bootstrap pf ( _ particle update _ ) . in the first step ,",
    "@xmath14 particles are drawn according to the state transition equation of ( [ eq : compact form ld ] ) .",
    "the next step is the _ weight update step_. in this step , each node uses its local observation and communicates with its neighbors to update its particle weights based on @xmath100 .",
    "the main problem here is that each dn does not have access to global observation vector ( it is defined as the union of local observation vectors , @xmath101 . to calculate the value of @xmath100 in a distributed manner at each dn",
    ", each node requires to calculate its local likelihood function @xmath102 based on its observation and communicates with its neighboring nodes .    .",
    "[ fig : block - diagram - of ] ]    to calculate the value of @xmath100 in a distributed manner , we assume that the local measurement noise sequences of the dns are independent .",
    "therefore , the global likelihood function can be factorized as the product of the local likelihood distributions @xcite as : @xmath103 the above equation requires the same set of particles @xmath104 is sampled at each iteration , hence , the synchronization of the local random number generators of dns is necessary .",
    "the synchronous operation of the dns can be achieved by use of random number generators with identical seeds that are initialized at the same points .",
    "therefore , each dn calculates its local likelihood function based on its observation vector . following ( [ eq : weights ] ) and the factorization of the global likelihood distribution given in ( [ eq : global likelihood-1 ] ) , the particle weights are calculated as follows : @xmath105 where @xmath106 indicates the product of the local likelihood functions of node @xmath80 and its neighboring nodes represented by @xmath107 . since , it is often easier to work with the logarithm of a probability rather than the probability itself , we take the natural logarithm from ( [ eq : weight update-1 ] ) . therefore ,",
    "applying the natural logarithm @xcite yields to : @xmath108 the above sum can be calculated in a distributed way by means of distributed average consensus algorithm @xcite and communication graph topology .",
    "the consensus filter is executed iteratively in every time step of the dpffd algorithm .",
    "the input of the consensus filter at each dn is the logarithm of the local likelihood function , @xmath109 . in the consensus algorithm ,",
    "each dn computes @xmath110 iteratively by communicating with its neighbors across the pre - defined graph topology and use of the weighted average as : @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are fixed weights.we employ the metropolis weights to calculate the value of @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "note that the time index of the consensus filter is denoted by @xmath114 indicating that the algorithm is iterated at every time step @xmath6 of the local pf algorithm .",
    "the algorithm is executed until a certain convergence error is achieved or a pre - determined number of iterations is reached .",
    "in fact , the consensus filter plays the role of observation fusion center .",
    "its output relies on two factors : i ) type of the consensus algorithm ; and ii ) the communication graph topology between dns .",
    "finally the particle weights are updated according to : @xmath115 the schematic of the local pf algorithm performed in one of the dns is depicted in figure [ fig : block - diagram - of ] .",
    "other steps include : weight normalization , resampling , and mmse state estimate performed in the same way as explained in section [ sec : centralized - particle - filtering ] .",
    "the output of each dn is the probabilities of the failure modes @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "it is important to note that due to the consensus filter embedded at each dn , we have @xmath117=e\\left[b_{2}^{j}\\left(k\\right)|\\mathcal{z}\\left(k\\right)\\right]$ ] .",
    "this equality states that the probability of each failure mode has the same value in every dn due to the execution of the distributed agreement protocol .",
    "similar to the centralized case , this value is used to trigger alarm indicators if it exceeds a certain threshold @xmath75 that marks the probability of detection .",
    "the block diagram of the dpffd algorithm is depicted in figure [ fig : proposed - distributed - fault ] . during the execution of the diagnostic routine ,",
    "each dn computes its local likelihood function based on a reduced - order measurement of the system s state .",
    "then , each dn broadcasts its local processed data to the consensus filter that is used to compute the particle weights .",
