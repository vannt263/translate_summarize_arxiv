    "in recent years , stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models have rapidly become a fundamental tool in the study of both galactic and extragalactic stellar populations ( see @xcite for some recent examples ) . despite the increasing sophistication of the underlying stellar models used in sps and ever - growing libraries of spectra ( both empirical and synthetic ) available to modellers ,",
    "there are still areas in which models , and methods for fitting them to observational data , can be significantly improved and expanded .",
    "some of the current shortcomings are due to the need to adopt simplifying assumptions about the stellar population in question in order to make some problems tractable , e.g. the fitting of simple stellar population ( ssp ) models to galaxies , assuming that they can be represented by a single age , single metallicity model .",
    "a key area in which simplifying assumptions are implicitly made is the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) for individual ssps  this is largely due to the limitations of theoretical isochrones , which are used as the basis of all sps models ( except those of maraston and co - workers , who use a fuel - consumption based method ",
    "see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however it is well known that the morphology of the hb can impact strongly on the integrated light of stellar populations especially if an extended blue component is present , potentially affecting both colours and line indices , and hence impacting on inferred ages for these systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence it is vital to assess the ways which these ` simplified ' hbs inherent in theoretical isochrones impact on sps models , and whether a more realistic and detailed treatment of the hb is necessary , or indeed practical .",
    "this is the purpose of the work presented here .    for unresolved stellar populations our knowledge of their ages and elemental abundances",
    "is largely derived through the fitting of diagnostic spectral indices , hence the focus of our work is to investigate the effect of a detailed treatment of the hb on key spectral indices , such as h@xmath1 .",
    "however , it is important to realise that our results will also impact on analyses which use full - spectrum fitting methods , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] .    in real stellar systems",
    "the horizontal extension of the hb is governed by stochastic mass loss in stars approaching the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "all the stars in a particular ssp leave the trgb with the same core mass but individual stars have different masses remaining in the outer layers , which determine the position of the star along the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) . in stellar models",
    "this mass loss is parameterised by the mass loss parameter , @xmath4 , which is assigned some fixed value calculated according to the reimers mass loss relation @xcite .",
    "hence in theoretical isochrones the hb comprises a single mass point , with no extension .",
    "it is worth remembering here that an isochrone consists of a series of evolutionary points ( eps ) which define the locus of points for an ssp .",
    "whilst each ep defines the appropriate stellar parameters for any star located at that point , in terms of mass , effective temperature and luminosity , they do not represent individual stars themselves . in order to create an ssp ,",
    "an isochrone is `` populated '' according to some initial mass function ( imf ) which effectively gives the appropriate weighting to each ep . in most population synthesis work the isochrone",
    "is treated as an analytical function for this purpose , so that all eps along the isochrone are smoothly populated and the zahb remains as a single mass point . in order to create a model with an extended hb , effectively incorporating a spread in mass loss , the isochrone ( or , at least , the hb portion ) must be populated with a discrete number of stars , so that each star in the hb phase can be assigned a specific mass from within some range of masses  this requires interpolation between individual core - helium burning stellar tracks .    creating an integrated spectrum for these extended hb models",
    "is a computationally expensive procedure since the time taken is proportional to the number of points in the simulation ( for details on how integrated spectra for ssps are produced the interested reader is referred to @xcite , hereafter p09 ) . for the analytical case ,",
    "the number of points is just the number of eps along the isochrone , which varies between a few hundred and around two thousand depending on which isochrone set is used . to populate an isochrone with individual stars",
    ", one has to consider the problem of statistical fluctuations which are likely to arise as a result of low numbers of stars ( and hence poor sampling ) in the later stages of evolution , including the hb phase .",
    "this is of particular relevance in the case of an ssp with an extended blue hb , since these hot blue hb stars give rise to strong balmer lines , which are generally used as the primary age indicators for stellar populations .",
    "this problem can only be overcome by using large numbers of points in the simulation , potentially up to @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , part of the work presented here is to explore how large these statistical fluctuations can be in real stellar clusters , and how many input stars are needed in the models to avoid significant uncertainties in ages and metallicities derived from the final integrated ssp spectra .",
    "another problem in creating models with extended hbs is that there is still no theory which predicts mass loss rates from stellar parameters and so the value of @xmath4 is chosen arbitrarily , usually to reflect the typical hbs seen in galactic globular clusters .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that clusters apparently with the same age and chemical composition can have different hb morphologies . however , in principle @xmath4 can take any value and so producing a database of sps models to cover all possibilities is not feasible .",
    "the pioneering work of @xcite ( hereafter l2000 ) highlighted the importance of including realistic hbs in stellar population work .",
    "l2000 created models for 15 ssps using a single value for the mass loss parameter for all their models , which was chosen to replicate the range of hbs seen in galactic globular clusters .",
    "they included a gaussian spread in the hb mass distribution of @xmath6=0.02@xmath7 to simulate the observed extension of the hb .",
    "this work graphically demonstrated the systematic variation of hb morphology with age and metallicity ( see their figure 5 ) , showing that , at fixed @xmath4 , hbs generally become bluer as metallicity decreases and as age increases .",
    "l2000 note that the strength of the h@xmath1 line in the integrated population does not increase monotonically as metallicity decreases at a fixed age , but peaks at some intermediate metallicity and then falls again as metallicity continues to decrease .",
    "this is because h@xmath1 reaches a maximum strength in stellar spectra when the effective temperature , @xmath8 , is around 9500k and so h@xmath1 is maximised if the distribution of stars along the hb centres around this value . in these cases",
    "the contribution to h@xmath1 from the hb completely dominates over the contribution from the main - sequence turnoff and makes the population look spuriously young .",
    "it is apparent from the l2000 figures , but not specifically noted by them , that the actual extension ( i.e. from red to blue ) of the hb in the colour - magnitude diagrams is very different for the various ssps , even though the value of @xmath4 and @xmath6 are the same .",
    "this is because the stellar effective temperature in this phase is extremely sensitive to very small changes in envelope mass and so the resulting hb morphologies can be very different , even when the same mass loss prescription is used .    in this paper",
    "we use similar techniques to l2000 to model extended hbs , populating them with discrete numbers of stars by interpolating between core - helium burning stellar tracks and using a gaussian spread in the mass loss distribution , and we extend that work in 3 key ways .",
    "firstly we explore the effects of varying @xmath4 at fixed age and metallicity , which enables us to model high mass loss in metal rich systems to see whether we can mimic a system such as m32 , which has approximately solar metallicity , but an extended blue hb component .",
    "we are also able to create ssps at different metallicities with bimodal hbs , similar to those observed in several galactic globular clusters .",
    "secondly , we create several models which we populate with numbers of stars representative of typical stellar clusters , and use monte carlo techniques to explore the impact of statistical fluctuations on measured diagnostic line indices , such as h@xmath1 .",
    "thirdly , we create full integrated high resolution spectra for all our models and simulations which enables us to assess the behaviour of all diagnostic line indices ( within a wavelength range 2500  to @xmath96000 ) , as well as the continuum flux .",
    "we also investigate whether there are any diagnostic indices capable of breaking the degeneracy between an old ssp with extended blue hb ( hence strong h@xmath1 ) and a truly young or intermediate age ssp .",
    "-enhanced , [ fe / h]=@xmath10 set .",
    "for clarity , only 500 points are plotted for each hb ( @xmath910000 were used in each simulation ) .",
    "the 14  gyr isochrone used for the underlying population up to the trgb is also plotted . for reference purposes , the later evolutionary stages of the isochone",
    "are also shown for the 2 ` standard ' cases in the basti database , i.e. with fixed @xmath4=0.2 and @xmath4=0.4 .",
    "horizontal branch morphology is parameterised by hb type=@xmath11",
    " see text for details.,width=302 ]    .parameters used for @xmath12-enhanced hb models . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:1sigma ]    results from the statistical fluctuation tests are displayed in figure  [ fig : sampling ] which shows the h@xmath1 vs. fe5406 and h@xmath1 vs. mgb diagnostic grids . for the @xmath13 gc simulations",
    "the scatter in h@xmath1 is significant , and is larger for the extended blue hb case .",
    "however it is difficult to rigorously quantify the impact on implied ages for 3 reasons .",
    "firstly , for the same degree of scatter in h@xmath1 , the scatter in apparent age depends on the absolute h@xmath1 strength , since h@xmath1 strength does not vary linearly with age .",
    "for example , a change of @xmath140.2 in h@xmath1 implies a shift of @xmath91  gyr for a 3  gyr ssp , but a shift of @xmath94  gyr for a 12  gyr ssp .",
    "secondly , for the extended blue hb case , the implied age is dominated by the large offset towards younger ages caused by the blue hb itself , i.e. here the underlying 14  gyr ssp appears to have an age @xmath95  gyr , even without the statistical fluctuations ( see figure  [ fig : aegrid ] ) .",
    "thirdly , the magnitude of the scatter in apparent age caused by the scatter in h@xmath1 also depends on which diagnostic grid is used and what the properties of the underlying population are .",
    "figure  [ fig : sampling ] illustrates this last point . in the left hand panel ( i.e. the h@xmath1 vs. fe5406 grid ) it can be seen that the fe5406 index also has a scatter of around @xmath140.1 , in addition to the scatter in h@xmath1 .",
    "for the extended blue hb case this induces an uncertainty on both the implied age and metallicity of the population .",
    "however for the red hb case ( model 1 ) , the magnitude of the fluctuations for these 2 indices conspires to scatter the points along a line of constant age , implying no uncertainty on the age .",
    "the right hand panel of figure  [ fig : sampling ] demonstrates that not all metallicity indicators behave similarly however  in this case , the mgb index shows only negligible fluctuations and all the scatter is seen in the h@xmath1 index , implying an uncertainty of @xmath142 - 3  gyr for the same red hb simulations .    as a guide to the relative significance of fluctuations in various diagnostic indices ,",
    "1@xmath15 variations from the 30 simulations of the extended blue hb case at @xmath13 are tabulated in table  3 for all 21 lick indices , plus h@xmath16 , h@xmath17 and caii .",
    "as might be expected , fluctuations in h@xmath1 are larger for the @xmath18 case with a scatter of around @xmath140.25 , implying an uncertainty of up to 2  gyrs on the modelled 3.5  gyr ssp .",
    "it should be noted that , in this case , most of the fluctuations are coming from discrete sampling in the upper portion of the rgb , since the hb consists of a very compact red clump with very little extension .",
    "results from the @xmath19 simulations are also plotted in figure  [ fig : sampling ] but have been arbitrarily shifted to the lower left hand corner of the diagrams for clarity .",
    "it can be seen that , even with this total mass , there are still fluctuations in the h@xmath1 index at the level of @xmath90.05 in ew , corresponding to an uncertainty in age of 0.5 - 1  gyr for old ssps .",
    "various of the metal lines also display low level fluctuations implying a minimum uncertainty of around 0.05  dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , for these @xmath19 simulations all indices only fluctuate at a level that is likely to be within the measurement errors for real data .",
    "to summarise , we have created integrated spectra for 16 ssps , 4 each at 4 different metallicities , all with an underlying age of 14  gyr , with a range of extended hb morphologies .",
    "this was done by varying the mass loss prescription for each individual ssp in 2 ways , firstly setting a mean mass , @xmath20 , for stars coming on to the zahb , and then adding a spread in mass loss , @xmath6 .",
    "we find that the h@xmath1 strength for each ssp depends on the exact temperature distribution of stars along the hb , which in turn depends on the exact details of the mass loss prescription coupled with the metallicity of the population in question .",
    "for any of the modelled ssps with any amount of blue hb extension , h@xmath1 is increased relative to the fixed @xmath4=0.2 case ( i.e. the ` standard ' models ) , implying younger ages than the actual ssp age of 14  gyr . in the worst - case scenario modelled here",
    ", a solar metallicity 14  gyr population with a blue hb which has a peak in its distribution of stars around 9000k , has an implied age of around 2  gyr from the strength of the h@xmath1 line .    our preliminary investigation to identify spectral features which might be capable of breaking the degeneracy between an old ssp with extended blue hb , and a truly intermediate age or young ssp , indicates that the caii index defined by @xcite is a very promising candidate , at least for populations with low velocity dispersions , such as extra - galactic globular clusters ( but see caveat in the following paragraph ) .",
    "there is also tentative evidence that the mgii index , in combination with mg@xmath3 , could also be a very useful tracer of hot blue hbs .",
    "there are also indications that the uv continuum shortward of the mgii feature could also potentially be a useful additional tool , although more work is needed to model this part of the spectrum in the required detail .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the extreme blue hb models ( i.e. models 3 and 4 presented here ) have very strong uv continuum flux , as demonstrated by figure  [ fig : diffspec ] , even at solar metallicity .",
    "this supports the idea that extreme blue hbs can be a significant contributor to the uv upturn identified in old elliptical galaxies ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "an important caveat to all the tests and results presented here is that all our models have been created using ssps , i.e. single age , single metallicity systems .",
    "however another scenario which could explain strong h@xmath1 lines in a predominantly old population would be the presence of a small fraction of very young stars .",
    "although this is not likely to be an issue for globular clusters ( galactic or extra - galactic ) it is a possibility which is hard to completely rule out for elliptical galaxies .",
    "preliminary tests with our population synthesis code indicate that adding even a very small percentage ( @xmath211% ) of a young ssp ( 300  myr or less ) to a 14  gyr ssp would significantly strengthen h@xmath1 and imply an intermediate age , around 5 - 6  gyr ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , this scenario of a ` frosting ' of young stars in an otherwise old stellar population has been explored by @xcite for ( apparently ) quiescent galaxies in the shapley supercluster . however ,",
    "@xcite use the caii index as a tracer of hot stars and , as we have shown here , this index also traces hot hb stars in an ssp .",
    "so far we have not identified any completely unambiguous tracers that can distinguish between the 3 scenarios ; 1 ) a small fraction of hot young stars in an otherwise old population , 2 ) an old ssp with a hot hb , 3 ) an intermediate age ssp .",
    "it seems likely that no single tracer will be able to disentangle these 3 cases and a combination of well understood spectral indices and colours may well be needed  this is the focus of our ongoing investigation .",
    "another factor potentially linked to extended blue hbs is the presence of a stellar subpopulation with a high helium fraction .",
    "@xcite showed that the same level of helium enrichment required to reproduce the bluer main sequence in the massive gc @xmath22 centauri would also naturally produce the extreme blue hb stars seen in that cluster .",
    "very recent observational results have provided some evidence for varying helium fractions within individual gcs and there is at least circumstantial evidence linking helium enriched subpopulations to extended blue hbs ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the theoretical support for the hb morphology  enhanced - helium connection is that stars born with a higher helium abundance will display a lower mass at the turn off for a given cluster age . a lower mass at the to will favour lower mass  hence hotter and bluer  hb stars .",
    "we were able to test the potential impact of a higher helium abundance on our present work by utilising the helium - enhanced isochrones in the basti database in combination with a grid of helium - enhanced spectra , which have been produced for a subsequent paper ( coelho , salaris & percival , 2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "we chose helium - enhancement at the level @xmath23 , for the [ fe / h]=@xmath24 isochrone , which is a reasonable enhancement over the standard cosmological value , given current observational constraints ( e.g. @xcite ) and our new spectra incorporate the same fe and he abundance ratios as the isochrones .",
    "as a preliminary test , we measured the strength of spectral features in individual spectra for both the standard helium and enhanced helium versions , matching the spectra in @xmath8 and log@xmath25 .",
    "we found that for all the diagnostic lines considered in this paper , the line strengths are practically indistinguishable for the two cases , with any differences being less than 1 percent ( i.e. within the measurement errors ) .",
    "we also created an integrated spectrum for the [ fe / h]=@xmath24 , 14  gyr ssp using the helium - enhanced isochrone in combination with the helium - enhanced spectra .",
    "again we found that the strengths of all the indices under scrutiny here are negligibly different from the standard helium case .",
    "we note here that this result is consistent with that of @xcite who find that a similar level of helium enhancement has a negligible effect on broadband colours .    the important point to stress here is that , whilst enhanced helium is a likely mechanism for producing extended blue hbs , it in no way impacts on the work presented in this study .",
    "our diagnostic models and tests are not intended to predict , @xmath26 , the existence of hot hb stars , but rather to find diagnostics which can distinguish their presence in a stellar population from other hot components , such as a young sub - population . whether a blue hb morphology arises from a large mass loss along the rgb in stars with ` normal ' helium , or from a more moderate mass loss from stars with higher helium ,",
    "the resulting integrated spectrum is largely unaffected  the only parameter that matters here is the temperature range of stars on the hb , irrespective of how they have been produced . in fact , the results of our enhanced helium tests , described above , show that enhanced helium has absolutely no impact on the diagnostic indices discussed here , such as h@xmath1 , mgii and caii , nor on the results of the statistical fluctuations tests discussed below .    finally , the results of the tests presented here in section  [ sec : statfluc ] demonstrate that several key diagnostic line indices are significantly affected by statistical fluctuations , even in average to large mass gcs .",
    "equally problematic is the fact that not all indices fluctuate at the same level  some are strongly affected , including all the balmer lines , whilst others are only negligibly affected , such as caii ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this is potentially a significant source of uncertainty if full - sed fitting methods are used to derive ages , metallicities and/or star formation histories from integrated spectra , since different features in a spectrum can be giving conflicting best fit parameters .",
    "the problem is illustrated in @xcite who present integrated spectra for 14 magellanic cloud stellar clusters for which they derive best fit ages and metallicities using 2 different fitting codes , starlight @xcite and @xmath27 @xcite , and 3 different sets of ssp models , from @xcite , @xcite ( pegase - hr ) and @xcite .",
    "half of the clusters studied have masses in the range @xmath28 , which corresponds to the low mass cluster modelled here , in section  [ sec : statfluc ] . for several clusters ,",
    "@xcite find that the results from the different fitting routines and models are completely discrepant .",
    "as an example , cluster hw1 yields best - fit ages of 3.2 , 5.8 , 7.9 , 9.0 , 9.4 and 10  gyr from the 6 different combinations of ssps models and sed - fitting routines , whilst its actual age is known to be around 6  gyr from isochrone fitting to the cmd .",
    "other clusters are even more unconstrained , yielding ages ranging from @xmath211  gyr to 10  gyr for the same cluster . some of these variations in best fit parameters are likely to be due to systematic uncertainties in stellar parameters inherent within the ssp models themselves ( see @xcite ) , but statistical fluctuations in the observed spectra are almost certainly contributing to the problem .",
    "hence we urge caution if these types of stellar clusters are to be used as empirical calibrating objects for various aspects of sps models .",
