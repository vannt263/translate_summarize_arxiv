    "one of the most intriguing feature of quantum mechanics is entanglement .",
    "as shown in the early 20th century by einstein , podolsky , and rosen , quantum entanglement gives rise to nonlocality , namely the fact that spatially separated systems may behave in a way that can not be explained by any local theory @xcite .",
    "this effect , although it does not violate causality , may nevertheless be verified experimentally , as originally discovered by bell @xcite .",
    "more specifically , one can write a bell inequality that must be obeyed by any local realistic model but is violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "interestingly , there also exist other types of nonlocal behaviors , which go beyond entanglement .",
    "inspired by an early work of peres and wootters on a nonlocal effect manifested by correlated product states @xcite , bennett _ et al .",
    "_ discovered a set of nine orthogonal product states in @xmath4 dimensions that can not be perfectly distinguished if the two parties are restricted to local operations and classical communications ( locc ) @xcite .",
    "this behavior was termed _",
    "nonlocality without entanglement _ ( nlwe ) since we have a truly nonlocal behavior while entanglement is used neither in the preparation of the states , nor in the joint measurement that discriminates them perfectly .",
    "in contrast , the model of peres and wootters concerned the joint measurement of a pair of qubits prepared in a product ( hence non - entangled ) state via an observable admitting entangled eigenstates ; they exhibited an example with correlated qubits where such a measurement gives more information than a separate locc - type measurement .",
    "the nlwe behavior can be viewed as a new striking example of the nonequivalence between the concept of quantum entanglement and that of quantum nonlocality .",
    "it was know since werner @xcite that entanglement does not necessarily imply nonlocality in the sense of producing data that are incompatible with local realism ( entanglement @xmath5 nonlocality ) .",
    "this new type of nonlocality implies that the converse does not hold either ( nonlocality @xmath5 entanglement ) .",
    "note that nonlocality is not understood here as the incompatibility with local realism , but instead as the advantage of a joint measurement with respect to all locc strategies .",
    "more generally , nlwe thus raises the question : what kind of global operations can or can not be performed using locc operations only ?",
    "this question has attracted a lot of attention over the recent years as it underpins the use of entanglement as a resource in quantum information theory .",
    "@xcite have shown that any two orthogonal quantum state , entangled or not , can be reliably distinguished using locc .",
    "later , walgate and hardy @xcite established the necessary and sufficient conditions for a general set of @xmath6 quantum states to be locally distinguishable , and for a general set of @xmath7 to be distinguished given an initial measurement of the qubit .",
    "these results reveal a fundamental _ asymmetry _ inherent to local distinguishability , which is conjectured to be at the origin of nlwe . for example , there exist sets of bipartite orthogonal product states that can not be reliably distinguished locally if bob is to go first and only one - way communication from him to alice is allowed , but can be distinguished if alice performs the first sequence of measurements and then shares her results with bob .",
    "one such set is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for the computational basis ( cb ) while @xmath10 stands for the dual basis ( db ) .",
    "groisman and vaidman @xcite studied the _",
    "one - way indistinguishability _ exhibited by this simple set , and used it to construct an alternative proof of the nlwe of the nine states found by bennett _",
    "_ @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we further investigate this close connection between nlwe and one - way indistinguishability by introducing a 2-qubit quantum gate called the control - hadamard ( control - h ) .",
    "this gate applies a hadamard transform to one of the qubits conditioned on the other qubit being in the appropriate state of the cb , say @xmath11 .",
    "not surprisingly , this gate is closely connected to the set ( [ set_g ] ) since it generates ( [ set_g ] ) when applied on the four states of the cb .",
    "this control - hadamard gate can be easily generalized to the @xmath0-partite case with @xmath12-dimensional systems : the hadamard transform becomes a @xmath12-dimensional quantum discrete fourier transform ( dft ) applied to the @xmath0th system , while the control extends to the @xmath1 first parties .",
    "we will refer to this gate as a control - dft@xmath13 in the following .    in section  [ sect2",
    "] , we will show that this control - h gate provides us with a nice formalism to understand the mechanism of nlwe . based on our observations of a known set exhibiting this phenomena , namely the so - called shift ensemble introduced in @xcite",
    ", we will derive in section  [ sect3 ] a generic method to construct multipartite product bases exhibiting nlwe with systems of arbitrary dimension .",
    "finally , in sections  [ sect4 ] and [ sect5 ] , we will exploit the fact that nlwe is connected to other peculiar quantum phenomena such as unextendible product bases ( upb ) @xcite and bound entanglement ( be ) @xcite , and will apply our method to generalize the construction of a large variety of upbs and related be states , a task that has proven to be extremely difficult in the past .",
    "the shift ensemble defined in @xcite is the following set of 8 orthogonal three - qubit product states , @xmath14 to understand why this set exhibits nlwe , consider the following game .",
    "an external party randomly chooses a number between 1 and 8 and accordingly prepares the corresponding quantum state @xmath15 .",
    "he then sends the shares of this state to alice , bob , and charles , who are located respectively at a , b , and c , and asks them to identify the state they have received , i.e. , to perfectly determine the value of @xmath16 . note that alice , bob , and charles know the precise form of the states of the set , but ignore which one has been prepared . to distinguish between the possible states , the players may have recourse to locc only",
    "this means that they are allowed to perform any sequence of local operations or measurements on their respective shares of the state and communicate their results to the other players through a classical channel , but can not perform a joint measurement or communicate through a quantum channel . indeed ,",
    "if the players had access to joint operations , the problem would be trivial since the states are orthogonal , hence perfectly distinguishable .",
    "surprisingly , it turns out that when the set of operations is restricted to locc , the players will never be able to perfectly distinguish between the 8 possible states @xcite .",
    "although the set is made of orthogonal product states , which can thus be prepared locally , it has the property of being _ locally indistinguishable _",
    "( throughout this paper , we use indistinguishable to mean not perfectly distinguishable ) .",
    "+     and @xmath17 , respectively . for example , the first gate applies a hadamard to charles qubit if alice s qubit is @xmath18 and bob s qubit is @xmath17 . ]",
    "it is interesting to investigate how the joint measurement , which perfectly discriminates between the states of the set , can be implemented in terms of quantum logic gates .",
    "formally , it is a projective measurement based on the 8 projectors onto product states @xmath19 .",
    "consider the 3-qubit unitary operation @xmath20 , which transforms the 8 states of the cb onto the states of the shift ensemble , @xmath21 .",
    "the knowledge of this joint unitary operation @xmath20 gives a simple strategy to perform the joint measurement : it can be decomposed as the sequence of the joint unitary operation @xmath22 followed by a local measurement by alice , bob , and charles in the computational basis .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the unitary @xmath20 can be implemented by a simple quantum circuit made of 3 identical control - hadamard gates . as seen in fig.[fig1 ] , this gate is a tripartite gate which applies a hadamard transform onto one of the qubits conditioned on the other two being in the appropriate product state @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , in case the hadamard acts on charles qubit , this control - h gate performs the operation @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "because of the cyclic control conditions , the 3 gates appearing in the circuit for @xmath20 are commuting ; one can easily check that if the control conditions are satisfied for one of the gates , they can not be satisfied for the two others . we will call this property _ exclusivity_. as an example , consider the first and second gates of the circuit . expressing the hadamard as @xmath27 with @xmath28 , these two gates can be written respectively as @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 we deduce from these expressions that @xmath32 since it contains the product @xmath33 , which translates the exclusivity property .",
    "hence , @xmath34=0 $ ] , and the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula gives @xmath35/2}\\\\ & = & { \\rm e}^{i(a+b ) } { \\rm e}^{[a , b]/2}\\\\ & = & { \\rm e}^{ib } { \\rm e}^{ia } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which proves the commutation between the first and second gates of the circuit ( the same reasoning holds for any two gates ) . + _ why does the circuit works ? _ consider first the ensemble constructed by applying only the first control - h ( the one that acts on charles qubit ) on the states of the cb . as shown in @xcite , this ensemble is indistinguishable if charles is forced to perform the first non - trivial step of the measurement strategy , or equivalently if he is restricted to one - way classical communication towards alice and bob .",
    "this is obvious as his share of the state could either be in the computational or in the dual basis , and any non - trivial measurement ( one that will gain some information about one of these bases ) will always irreversibly loose some information about the conjugate basis .",
    "of course , if alice and bob start while charles is allowed to delay his measurement , then the set appears perfectly distinguishable .",
    "alice and bob should simply measure in the cb and then inform charles about the basis he should use .",
    "this is what walgate and hardy called the `` asymmetry of local distinguishability '' .",
    "+ next , let us play the same game but using a quantum circuit made of the two first control - h gates ( those acting on charles and bob s qubits ) .",
    "the fact that the two gates are commuting ( and exclusive ) guarantees that no entanglement will be created when the sates of the cb are processed , i.e. , the product states of the cb transform into another set of product states .",
    "this time , the ensemble appears indistinguishable to both charles and bob as their shares of the states are made of non - orthogonal , hence indistinguishable , states .",
    "this is obvious if we adopt a measurement point of view .",
    "the second gate tells us that bob can not start .",
    "but , since the gates commute , the second gate can be interchanged with the first , leading to the similar conclusion that charles can not start .",
    "thus , in order to perfectly distinguish the states locally , neither bob nor charles may start .",
    "again , if it is alice who goes first , then the ensemble becomes locally distinguishable .",
    "she simply measures her share of the state in the cb : if she gets a @xmath18 she knows that bob s share should be measured in the cb , and the outcome of bob s measurement determines which basis charles should use .",
    "a @xmath17 simply interchanges charles and bob s roles . in short",
    ", this ensemble is locally indistinguishable if charles or bob are forced to start , but distinguishable if alice goes first .",
    "+ now , consider the entire circuit of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , that is , the circuit made of the 3 control - h gates and the shift ensemble that it generates . following the two previous examples , we know that this ensemble is locally indistinguishable as each player sees an indistinguishable subset created by the hadamard gate acting on his qubit ( this gate can be placed last in the circuit ) . consequently , in this case _ nobody _ wants to start .",
    "because in every locc strategy , _ someone _ has to start , we get a simple picture of why the shift ensemble exhibits nlwe .",
    "this can be summarized as follows :    \\1 . in every locc strategy",
    ", someone has to start    \\2 .",
    "the last gate implies that alice can not start    \\3 .",
    "the gates commute and can thus be interchanged    \\4 . by ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , nobody wants to start    \\5 .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) are incompatible    the three scenarios we have presented and the corresponding locc strategies can be nicely illustrated with the diagrams of fig .",
    "the arrows represent the minimum amount of communication required to make the ensemble locally distinguishable .",
    "this intuitive picture will be translated into a rigorous proof in the next section .",
    "with the intuition gained from our circuit , we see that what is really at issue in nlwe is not the kind of locc protocols employed by the parties , nor the content of their communication , but rather the asymmetry of local distinguishability encapsulated in the states themselves . indeed , it is because each player does not know which of the two conjugated basis he should use to measure his share of the state ( the set is indistinguishable from his point of view ) and because all players are in this same situation ( the gates commute ) that the ensemble is locally indistinguishable as a whole .",
    "all we have used so far is thus the possibility , for each player , to have a state belonging to two conjugate bases .",
    "we may therefore extend our construction to systems of arbitrary dimension instead of qubits .",
    "given the central role played by the control - h gate , which creates this local indistinguishability , we may replace it with a @xmath12-dimensional quantum discrete fourier transform ( dft@xmath13 ) .",
    "this yields a simple strategy to construct an ensemble made of orthogonal tripartite product states of arbitrary dimensions that exhibits nlwe .",
    "note that by changing the control conditions of the gates while maintaining their exclusivity , we can define a whole family of nlwe ensembles with equivalent properties .",
    "furthermore , there is no need to restrict the circuit to a tripartite scenario . knowing that the key ingredient is a sequence of control - dft gates that are exclusive ( hence commuting )",
    ", we can further generalize the method and increase the number of parties .",
    "the quantum circuit will now be made of @xmath0 control - dft gates , one acting on each player , and we require these gates to be exclusive to make sure that the resulting ensemble is made of product states .",
    "this imposes some constraint on the dimensions of the players shares .",
    "a simple way to satisfy this exclusivity condition is to require that each player has a hilbert space large enough to accommodate @xmath1 gates with a different control state .",
    "we can therefore state the following sufficient condition @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the dimension of @xmath38 , the hilbert space of player @xmath39 , and @xmath0 is the total number of players .",
    "we thus have established a generic method to construct some @xmath0-partite ensemble of product states exhibiting nlwe using systems of arbitrary dimension : + _ statement : if we have @xmath40 parties working in respective hilbert spaces @xmath38 of dimension @xmath41 , a quantum circuit can be defined , based on @xmath0 control - dft gates , which generates a set @xmath42 made of @xmath43 orthogonal product states that form a basis of @xmath44 and exhibit nonlocality without entanglement . _",
    "+    . the first gate applies a discrete fourier transform in dimension @xmath45 to damian s qutrit if alice s state is a @xmath46 , bob s state a @xmath47 and charles state a @xmath48 . ]",
    "_ proof : _ let us denote the cb of player @xmath39 by @xmath49 .",
    "we consider the ensemble generated from the cb of all players by applying the unitary @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 are cyclic permutations of @xmath53 . in the simplest case",
    ", each party has a dimension @xmath54 , saturating relation ( [ dn ] ) , but this is not necessary for the proof to hold .",
    "as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the circuit generating this simplest ensemble exhibiting nlwe for a quadripartite scenario in which all parties hold a qutrit , i.e. , in a hilbert space of total dimension @xmath55 .",
    "let us proof now that the ensemble generated by ( [ shiftd ] ) exhibits nlwe .",
    "suppose alice has a share of dimension @xmath12 and performs the first step of the measurement procedure .",
    "we will show that , under the simple constraint of not allowing her operation to lead to a situation in which it has become impossible in principle to perfectly distinguish between the initial states @xmath56 , then she can not gain any information .",
    "first , let us rewrite the states of the ensemble as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is alice s share and @xmath59 is the state held by all the other players .",
    "we describe alice s measurement in two stages : first , her share of the state and the measuring device evolve unitarily under the action of some unitary operator @xmath60 ; second , some outcome @xmath61 is read out",
    ". the unitary evolution of alice s share and the measuring device can be described by : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the initial state of the measuring device , and @xmath64 is the joint state of alice s share and the measuring device corresponding to a particular outcome k. without restriction , we can choose @xmath65 to be real and non - negative .",
    "importantly , the states @xmath66 with different @xmath61 must be orthogonal as they correspond to different outcomes of the macroscopic measuring device .",
    "note that for each @xmath61 , only @xmath67 couples @xmath68 are necessary to completely describe the unitary evolution @xmath60 since alice only sees @xmath67 distinct states @xmath69 ( @xmath12 states of the cb and @xmath12 states of the db ) .",
    "we therefore redefine the unitary evolution @xmath60 via the @xmath67 relations @xmath70 with @xmath61 labeling the different outcomes , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 denoting the states of the db .",
    "next , we must impose some constraints on alice s possible operations .",
    "on the one hand , she has to distinguish between the @xmath12 states that are in the db at her side since these states appear identical to the other parties . on the other hand , there are also states that are in the cb but are only distinguishable by alice as they appear nonorthogonal to the other parties [ e.g. , the states @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the ensemble ( [ shift ] ) , or the states @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ] . for those states , which she sees as orthogonal",
    ", she must maintain perfect distinguishability whatever action she performs and for every value of the outcome @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , her measurement must either distinguish these states outright or leave them orthogonal , i.e. , we must impose for every @xmath61 and for all @xmath77 @xmath78 in addition to these @xmath79 constraints , we also need to consider the relations between the possible initial states at alice s site .",
    "more precisely , we know that the cb and db are related by the quantum fourier transform : @xmath80 the unitary evolution @xmath60 must conserve these relations , and , since @xmath81 with different @xmath61 are orthogonal , we can write @xmath67 relations of the form @xmath82 for each outcome @xmath61 , with @xmath83 . consider the last @xmath12 relations of ( [ rr ] ) .",
    "if we take the scalar product of two of them and reorganize appropriately the different terms of the sums , we obtain @xmath84 if we now choose @xmath85 , it follows @xmath86 by the second condition of ( [ orthd ] ) , all the terms of the second sum of the right - hand side are trivially equal to zero . since the remaining term does not depend on the value of @xmath87 , we conclude that , for each value of the outcome @xmath61 , all the @xmath88 s are equal . similarly , from the other @xmath12 conjugated relations of ( [ rr ] ) , we conclude that for all @xmath61 the @xmath89 s must be equal and equal to the @xmath88 s .",
    "it follows that if @xmath61 is a possible outcome for one particular initial state @xmath90 , then @xmath61 is a possible outcome for all the initial states .",
    "in addition , for all such outcomes @xmath61 the distinguishability condition ( [ orthd ] ) becomes the true orthogonality condition @xmath91 to summarize , after a measurement procedure which produced the outcome @xmath61 , the set of possible initial states of alice s share together with the measuring device have evolved into a set of states which is isomorphic to the initial set , i.e. , no information can be gained and communicated to the other players from the value of @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in order to perfectly distinguish between the states , alice can not start . in view of the commutation of the gates ,",
    "similar arguments can be used to show that the other players face the same dilemma of either gaining some useful information at the cost of irreversibly loosing perfect distinguishability , or not gaining any information at all .",
    "this completes the proof . @xmath92 +",
    ", one gets another ensemble exhibiting nlwe in dimension @xmath55 .",

    "indeed , for @xmath93 the size of the local hilbert space allows for the introduction of more gates without loosing the exclusivity ( or commutation ) condition .",

    "let us note that although our method _ as it is _ fails to create bipartite nlwe , the @xmath95 bipartite qutrit states ( `` domino '' states ) of @xcite do fit into our picture of commuting control gates .",
    "we can associate to this set a quantum circuit made of 4 control - gates , two for each player , where the exclusivity of the gates requires the fourier transform to act on 2-dimensional subspaces of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "an unextendible product basis is an incomplete orthogonal product basis whose complementary subspace contains no product state . _",

    "we complete these @xmath113 states by adding a proper _ stopper _ state , so as to force the unextendibility of the set .",

    "clearly , because of the @xmath109 states that are in the db for alice together with the stopper sate , we can not find a state orthogonal to alice s share ( this subset of @xmath102 states span her entire subspace ) .",

    "but the same argument as for alice s subspace can be applied as well .",

    "we therefore derive the first method to construct @xmath0-partite @xmath12-dimensional product bases exhibiting nlwe .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we display the quantum circuit generating the set exhibiting nlwe with 4 qutrits ; to our knowledge , it is the first example of nlwe in @xmath55 .",
    "the ingredients of our method are very general , and incorporate also the construction of the other known examples of nlwe introduced in @xcite . in contrary to the original work of ref .",
    "@xcite , we did not attempt to place a bound on the mutual information attainable through locc , but rather adopted the strategy of @xcite and restricted ourselves to proving that such a nontrivial bound exists .",
    "however , a strategy to calculate this bound is needed as it would allow us to compare the degree of nonlocality exhibited by the different ensembles we can construct with this method , so it is an interesting challenge for future work . because nlwe is connected to other quantum peculiarities such as unextendible product bases and bound entanglement , our method can be adapted to construct @xmath0-partite high - dimensional upbs and their associated be states , a task that has proven to be difficult in the past .",
