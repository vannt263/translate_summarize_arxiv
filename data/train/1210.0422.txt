    "recent statistical investigations pointed out that the nuclear regions of approximately 20 per cent of nearby galaxies show emission from ionized gas @xcite .",
    "the presence of this component is mostly explained by processes related either to intense star formation or to non - thermal activity in the nucleus . in principle , it is possible to distinguish the signature of the two different possibilities from the spectrum emitted by the ionized gas ( see e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "from a practical point of view , however , the task is made difficult because of the trend , observed in large samples of sources , to settle on to a smooth sequence , rather than forming distinct distributions .",
    "the problem is partially due to the difficulties related to the spectroscopic measurements , which lie at the basis of the technique , but the existence of a population of transition objects , characterized by intermediate properties , also plays an important role .",
    "there are in fact numerous works where the relationship between nuclear activity and star formation processes in the central regions of galaxies is addressed , mainly taking into account seyfert 2 galaxies ( e. g. * ? ? ?",

    "the properties of type 1 objects are clearly harder to understand , because the light , coming directly from the nuclear source , usually outshines the surrounding regions .",
    "this problem leaves open the question whether the sources are intrinsically different or not , which is a concern both for black hole  host galaxy relationships and for agn unification theories . at present , evidence for recent nuclear star formation exists also for type 1 agns ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is believed that there is little or no difference with respect to type 2 objects under this point of view , but the debate is still in progress .    as a result , though some kind of connection between nuclear activity and star formation must exist , its physical role is not yet clarified .",
    "several theories were developed , mainly invoking effects that could lead from nuclear star formation to agns and then evaluating the energetic feedback on the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "however , the possibility that the relation may change , depending on the host galaxy properties , should also be taken into account .",
    "indeed , it has been pointed out that the high velocity outflows , produced by the most massive stars of a young stellar population , are very unlikely to feed nuclear activity and they can even sweep the interstellar medium of low mass galaxies , preventing the onset of further star formation or nuclear activity . in very massive galaxies , on the other hand , the large amount of gas trapped in the gravitational field could serve as fuel for a powerful agn , which is again expected to stop the formation of new stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "such triggers may explain the reason why star formation is currently observed over a typically limited range of medium mass galaxies .",
    "in this work , we study the properties of the circum - nuclear regions of galaxies , whose spectra indicate the existence of an interstellar medium ( ism ) , which is ionized either by hot young stars or by non - thermal activity of the nucleus . after selecting our targets ,",
    "we carry out an extensive analysis of their stellar populations , their chemical compositions , and their ionization sources .",
    "comparing such properties with those of quiescent galaxies , we find additional evidence of close relationships between nuclear activity and star formation processes , together with several sequences , indicating a possible evolutionary connection between the different classes .",
    "our work is organized as follows : in  2 we describe the selection of our sample and its basilar properties ;  3 introduces the data analysis and the strategies that we applied to perform our measurements ; in  4 we present a discussion of our results and of their interpretation , while our conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "to investigate the relationship between star forming galaxies ( sfg ) and agns , our work required the selection of a wide sample of emission line galaxies .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provided the ideal archive of spectroscopic data for our purposes .",
    "here we looked for the spectra of galaxies with ionized gas components in the nucleus .",
    "the classification of these objects according to their ionization source led to the introduction of a diagnostic technique , which could successfully manage line emitting sources , including both type 1 and type 2 agns .",
    "our choice fell on the diagram plotting @xmath0 3727 } / f_{\\rm [ o iii ] 5007})$ ] against @xmath1 6300 } / f_{\\rm [ o iii ] 5007})$ ] ( hereafter the @xmath2 diagram ) .",
    "this instrument is a combination of two diagnostic ratios that express , respectively , the ionization degree and the hardness of the ionizing spectrum at large radii from the source @xcite .",
    "it provides the clear advantages of being compatible with all types of agn spectra , to be nearly independent from the chemical composition of gas , and to be free from stellar absorption contaminations , which are relevant for most recombination lines . on the other hand",
    ", it may suffer from differential extinction effects , while the [ o  i ] emission line is often weak and difficult to measure in noisy spectra .",
    "for this reason we collected the spectra of galaxies with detected emission lines of [ o  iii]@xmath3 , [ o  ii]@xmath4 and [ o  i]@xmath5 , requiring a s / n  @xmath6 for [ o  i ] .",
    "we extracted 119226 spectra that we plot in the @xmath2 diagram of fig .",

    "the red contours show the density distribution of sources in levels spaced by 100 objects per 0.05  dex square bin on the diagram .",

    "we , thus , built histograms showing the two - peaked source distributions and we located the minimum for each bin .",

    "\\eqno(1)\\ ] ]         by taking into account only the objects below the curve , we isolated a sample of approximately 16000 objects that consists of 60 per cent seyfert galaxies , including both broad and narrow line sources , 31 per cent composite seyfert - h  ii galaxies , 4 per cent liners , and 5 per cent sfgs .    a detailed classification of the narrow line emitting objects , identified by means of a line profile fitting code described in a companion paper ( ggfit , * ?",
    "* ) , can be performed by application of the classic vo diagnostic diagrams . before proceeding , however , we have to account for the stellar contributions , which significantly affect the intensities of recombination lines like h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 .",
    "these contributions were estimated with a spectral synthesis technique , based on the starlight code @xcite , using a set of 92 simple stellar population spectra ( ssp ) , obtained combining 23 ages ( from @xmath12  yr up to @xmath13  yr ) and 4 metallicities ( z = 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.020 , and 0.050 ) from the library of @xcite . in order to fit the observed spectra",
    ", we had to correct them for the extinction arising in our own galaxy , according to the extinction map provided by the ned service , to remove the cosmological redshift , and to re - sample the data in a fixed wavelength dispersion .",
    "we performed these operations by means of the iraf tasks deredden , newredshift , and dispcor .",
    "such procedures were meant to derive accurate models of the spectral continua and absorption lines , thus producing residuals of pure emission line spectra , provided that the @xmath14 of original data was high enough . a threshold value of @xmath15 at 5500    granted the possibility to apply the fitting procedures with reliable results .    since we are interested in the properties of the circum - nuclear regions of the galaxies , we restrict the sample to objects in the redshift range of @xmath16 , where the sdss fiber aperture covers a region of @xmath17kpc in radius . in this study we considered only seyfert 2 galaxies ( s2 g ) , collecting 2153 objects .",
    "a set of 1302 sfgs was identified on the diagnostic diagrams , by applying the constraints @xcite : @xmath18 / { \\rm h}\\beta ) < 0.61 / [ \\log ( [ { \\rm n\\ , ii } ] / { \\rm h}\\alpha ) ] + 1.3 \\eqno(2a)\\ ] ] @xmath18 / { \\rm h}\\beta ) < 0.72 / [ \\log ( [ { \\rm s\\ , ii } ] / { \\rm h}\\alpha ) ] + 1.3 \\eqno(2b)\\ ] ] @xmath18 / { \\rm h}\\beta ) < 0.73 / [ \\log ( [ { \\rm o\\ , i } ] / { \\rm h}\\alpha ) ] + 1.33 \\eqno(2c)\\ ] ] we finally collected an additional set of galaxy spectra , without detected emission lines , selecting 3000 objects , above the adopted @xmath19 threshold at 5500   , that were observed in the same redshift range . these formed our normal galaxy sample ( ng ) , which we compared to the line emitting objects .",
    "more general properties of the agn class , including broad line emitting sources , will be dealt with in @xcite .",
    "the circum - nuclear stellar populations of our galaxy sample contribute to the observed spectra with various components . depending on the object distance , different fractions of the target galaxy",
    "lie in the region covered by the spectrograph fibers . as a result",
    ", we observe the composite spectrum of integrated stellar populations , with their characteristic continuum and absorption lines , overlapped to the emission lines , produced by the diffuse ionized gas .",
    "to apply the classification procedures , described above , and to investigate the physical properties of the sample , we need to distinguish between these components . for this purpose , we reproduced the stellar populations , which originate the spectra of all the selected galaxies , using starlight .",
    "the models were computed applying linear combinations of the 92 synthetic spectra of ssps , with homogeneous age and chemical composition , extracted from the library of @xcite and sampled at the same spectral resolution of data .",
    "some model examples , for the spectra of ngs , s2gs and sfgs , are given in fig .",
    "2 . after masking the wavelength ranges affected by strong emission lines",
    ", we modeled the spectra with starlight , thus estimating the weight of each ssp contribution to the integrated signal and reproducing pure stellar spectra .",
    "applying this analysis to the whole sample , we observe that , on average , the properties of stellar populations differ significantly in the nuclei of distinct galaxy classes . fig .",
    "3 illustrates this general result in a plot of the average spectra of sfgs , s2gs , and ngs , for comparison , after normalization to the specific flux at 5500   .",
    "according to expectations , the spectra of sfgs are clearly different , with respect to the other classes , due to the presence of young hot stars , which dominate the emission , yielding a blue peaked spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the spectra of ngs and s2gs , on the other hand , are remarkably similar and characteristic of an evolved stellar population . in spite of the comparable seds , however , s2gs show on average a 4000    break that is clearly shallower than the corresponding feature of ngs .",
    "it becomes therefore evident that an excess of hot stars , specifically belonging to the spectral class a , populates the circum - nuclear region of active galaxies .    , width=317 ]    in the following sections we shall discuss how the average properties detected in the sample affect the central environment of the objects under investigation .",
    "the focus of our analysis will be centered on the region covered by the @xmath17kpc aperture of the sdss fiber including the galaxy nuclei .",
    "we dub such region the circum - nuclear part of the galaxy , while we talk about _ nuclear processes _ to refer to the unresolved source of ionizing radiation in the nucleus .",
    "once the stellar contributions in our sample of spectra had been reproduced by means of proper templates , we turned our attention to the analysis of the diffuse ism .",
    "this task requires different approaches for the various classes of galactic nuclei we previously distinguished .",
    "indeed , the physical processes , which are relevant to ionized gas in presence of either an agn or young stars , represent far extremes of the ionization phenomenology and they involve quite different gas phases . each class",
    "must , therefore , be dealt with by means of the most appropriate technique , though tests performed by comparing the results of multiple methods on the same objects have also been taken into account .",
    "modeling the physics of ionized gas emitting regions in agns is a great challenge .",
    "following @xcite , there are five main aspects to be taken into account for a correct representation of the ionized gas : photoionization and radiative recombination , thermal balance , ionizing spectrum , gas chemical composition , and cloud or filament distribution . in addition",
    ", the thermal balance has to consider mechanical heating and the role of dust , which is always present in the narrow line regions ( nlr ) of agns .",
    "we have excluded from our analysis gas kinematics , winds , and gas confinement mechanisms .",
    "exploiting photoionization codes , such as cloudy v06.02 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we are able to solve numerically the ionization and thermal structure of a single cloud",
    ". however , we can also explore different parameter spaces and build more sophisticated models , such as composite models with more clouds and various geometries , as well as time dependent models . in our calculations we assumed open geometry .",
    "the input parameters , that we are considering , include the ionizing spectrum ( a non - thermal power law , in our case ) , the density @xmath20 , the ionized column density @xmath21(h  ii ) , the ionization parameter @xmath22 , and the metal abundances @xmath23 .",
    "the ionization parameter expresses the ionization degree of photo - ionized gas and it is defined as the ratio of the ionizing photon density and the gas density , according to the relation : @xmath24    .single cloud model parameter space [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the other hand , as we show in fig .  7",
    ", a substantially different situation applies to the chemical properties of the ism in star forming galaxies . according to the metallicity indicators discussed in  3.2.2 , these objects are rather characterized by ism with a sub - solar chemical composition , suggesting that their on - going star formation is a first generation process .",
    "this result is also confirmed by the evidence that stellar masses in galaxies hosting nuclear star formation are generally lower than in s2gs , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the processes of star formation and stellar feedback originate an interplay , which connects the chemical properties of stars with those of the ism , wherein they reside .",
    "the inter - stellar gas is chemically enriched through stellar activity , while the metallicity of stars reflects the chemical composition of the environment , where they are formed .",
    "the spectral synthesis technique , which we exploited to account for the stellar continua and absorption features , reproduce the circum - nuclear stellar populations of our galaxy sample , in terms of a mixture of ssps .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the average stellar population metallicities through : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass fraction ascribed to the @xmath27-th ssp component of the spectrum .",
    "considerations on the application of such paradigm to large samples led to evaluate a typical uncertainty of @xmath28dex .        despite the different chemical compositions of the gas seen in fig .",
    "7 , the average metallicity detected in the stellar populations in sfgs and s2gs is mostly similar , but with a slight over - abundance of heavy elements in the second group . as it is shown in fig .  8 ,",
    "indeed , the metallicity of stars in the sfg sample stays low , with no appreciable dependence on the age of the populations , as we would expect for a generation of stars originated by an unpolluted medium .",
    "s2gs , on the contrary , exhibit also a spread of high metallicity population components , which represents a hint of further star formation in a chemically enriched medium , bringing such objects on the same range of metallicities , commonly observed in the circum - nuclear regions of ngs .",
    "this result indicates that sfgs and s2gs host stellar populations mainly formed in a pristine inter - stellar gas , but , as it is also suggested by the average spectral properties illustrated in fig .  3 , the process occurred earlier in s2gs , where the o / b spectral class stars have already evolved off the main sequence .",
    "if this scenario is actually correct and we do observe stellar populations formed by pristine gas both in sfgs and s2gs , then it is likely that the circum - nuclear regions of active galaxies experienced past star formation , on a time scale which should account for the evolution of massive and short - lived o / b stars and for the enrichment of the ism , but not for that of lower mass a stars , as well as for the formation of new stars in the enriched medium .",
    "a look at the relationship between the stellar population ages in the circum - nuclear regions of galaxies and their total stellar masses , illustrated in fig .",
    "9 , also reveals some further interesting effects .",
    "sfgs and s2gs , indeed , lie on what appears to be a well defined sequence of increasing nuclear population age for larger total mass .",
    "the sequence has a high mass break and the range of masses , where agn activity is observed , is also populated by ngs .",
    "the total stellar mass , therefore , increases regularly with age , through the star forming and nuclear activity stages .",
    "later on , the stellar mass assembly is stopped and galaxies evolve as quiescent objects , dominated by old populations . before drawing any conclusions , however , we have to consider the possible biases , introduced by our sample selection criteria .",
    "in particular , the choice of a @xmath29 limiting threshold reflects in the selection of more luminous objects .",
    "sfgs are not particularly prone to this problem , because the high luminosity of their young stellar populations enables us to detect objects with fairly small masses , but for s2gs and ngs this could be a real issue . if we look at the mass distribution of the sdss line emitting sources , which , in the considered redshift range , fall in the agn region of the @xmath2 diagram , however , it turns out that a @xmath19 threshold is not systematically excluding low mass objects from the sample , so that the observed mass range for s2gs is a real feature in the considered volume .",
    "the ng sample , on the other hand , experiences a quite different situation . in this case",
    ", we are not able to include very low mass quiescent objects , but the issue is not particularly critical for our interests , because the artificial cut - off falls below the transition region between star forming and active galaxies . moreover , as we noted in the analysis of the average spectral properties , in order for the difference between the spectra of s2gs and ngs to have an appreciable physical meaning , we need that the ng sample covers a similar mass range , with respect to the s2gs",
    ". therefore , the adopted limiting constraints do not affect the s2 g distribution , though we may expect that the ng population extends well below the detected lower end of the s2 g mass range .",
    "further investigation on the properties of low mass ngs would represent a useful extension of our work , but the task would require extensive spectral modeling of large numbers of spectra , which is beyond the scope of our current analysis .",
    "spectral index plotted against the total estimated mass of sfgs , s2gs , and ngs .",
    "symbols are the same as in fig .",
    "8.,width=317 ]    the differences that we appreciated on the basis of our averaged analysis can be better understood by looking at the diagram plotted in fig .  10 , where we show the distribution of the @xmath30(4000   ) spectral index ( defined as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a function of the total stellar mass .",
    "the region covered by sfgs and s2gs represents a well defined sequence of regular growth in the index , with increasing host galaxy stellar mass .",
    "quiescent galaxies , instead , are well separated from this sequence .",
    "the situation is fully consistent with a smooth transition of gradually increasing stellar ages in a generation of stars formed in pristine gas , as soon as we move from low mass sfgs to high mass sfgs , all the way across s2gs .",
    "the transition region can be identified within a range of total stellar masses of @xmath31 .",
    "the overlapping mass range may represent a region where star forming activity is most likely going to start an interplay with the agn . depending on the interaction between these processes ,",
    "the galaxy may either stop its stellar mass assembly , eventually evolving as a low mass quiescent system , or form new generations of stars , like the high metallicity populations detected in some s2 g spectra of our sample , to become a high mass system .",
    "the difference between the two evolutionary possibilities probably resides in the power of the nuclear source and the way it affects ism in the surrounding space .",
    "as we subdivide our observational sample in objects with different types of nuclear activity , taking into account seyfert 2 , star forming nuclei and normal galaxies , we observe that the circum - nuclear environments are characterized by appreciably different properties .",
    "objects featuring ionized gas in their nuclear spectra show distinct ism chemical compositions , characteristic of pristine gas in sfgs and of evolved medium in s2gs .",
    "the stellar populations , however , do not reflect such a dichotomy , being almost everywhere consistent with star formation powered by pristine gas .",
    "another striking property is the appreciably tight relationship , which holds between the age of stars and the global stellar mass of galaxies .",
    "a relationship between the age of stars and the stellar mass observed in galaxies is expected , if more massive systems are also forming more quickly . since the circum - nuclear regions of active galaxies appear",
    "to be more likely explained as the result of a single star formation event , rather than as the combination of several loops , our analysis suggests that nuclear activity takes place after the bulk of stellar mass assembly has occurred . because of its role in controlling the star formation time - scale , the observed stellar mass is likely a key parameter in determining whether an agn can be triggered and if star formation can affect the circum - nuclear regions further on .",
    "the average trends that we identified in our sample actually mark an important distinction in the environment of individual galaxies , whose nuclei are affected by different degrees of activity . the properties observed within a wide sample of galaxies , including normal objects , as well as star forming and active ones , are consistent with the expectation that star formation and nuclear activity should be actually related in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the connection can be largely supported on the basis of sound theoretical grounds , but it is still missing a conclusive observational confirmation .",
    "in our analysis we identified several properties of the selected galaxies , which may lead to a more precise investigation of the problem and , ultimately , to a clearer view of the general picture .      1 .",
    "there is a range of galaxy masses ( @xmath31 ) where sfgs and agns are characterized by circum - nuclear stellar populations of approximately the same age and similar chemical abundances in the stellar component ; 2 .",
    "objects in this range are the oldest sfgs and the youngest agns ( in terms of stellar population ) ; 3 .",
    "although the metallicity of stars in sfgs within this mass range are indistinguishable from those of lower mass objects and from most of the s2gs , there are some s2gs showing evidence for further evolution .",
    "the metallicity of the stars seems to be independent from the mass of the whole galaxy and from the age of the circum - nuclear stellar population , as it is the case for the gaseous component .",
    "this suggests that we are observing different stages of the evolution of the same star formation process .",
    "therefore , the circum - nuclear regions of sfgs with mass @xmath31 , which are clearly in a more advanced evolutionary stage than lower mass sfgs , seem to be the most promising candidate precursors of agns , if there is any causal link between the two phenomena .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the conclusions reported in the high resolution studies of @xcite , who , investigating the nuclear environment on a much smaller scale , in a few particular cases , were able to detect co - existing star formation and nuclear activity and to estimate the typical time - scales connecting the two processes .",
    "further evidence for a connection between star formation and nuclear activity from a much more similar dataset was also achieved by @xcite , in their analysis of the role of agn feedback in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "looking at a sample of early type objects in the redshift range @xmath32 , they concluded that agn feedback is a key process in the evolution of a galaxy through its stages of star formation , nuclear activity and quiescent existence .",
    "they also conclude that the agn feedback process is likely to smoothly affect the star formation rate of a galaxy , during time , and that more massive objects experienced this transition earlier .",

    "<S> the existence of correlations between nuclear properties of galaxies , such as the mass of their central black holes , and larger scale features , like the bulge mass and luminosity , represent a fundamental constraint on galaxy evolution . </S>",
    "<S> although the actual reasons for these relations have not yet been identified , it is widely believed that they could stem from a connection between the processes that lead to black hole growth and stellar mass assembly . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of understanding how the processes of nuclear activity and star formation can affect each other became known to the literature as the starburst - agn connection . despite years of investigation , the physical mechanisms which lie at the basis of this relation are known only in part . </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we analyze the problem of star formation and nuclear activity in a large sample of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we study the relations between the properties of the nuclear environments and of their host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mass of the stellar component within the galaxies of our sample is a critical parameter , that we have to consider in an evolutionary sequence , which provides further insight in the connection between agn and star formation processes .    </S>",
