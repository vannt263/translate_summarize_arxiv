    "clinoatacamite contains three crystallographically distinct cu sites , such that the crystal structure consists of kagome planes of cu2 and cu3 sites alternating with triangular planes of cu1 sites .",
    "@xcite these sites are distinguished primarily through the cu - o - cu bond angle , with an average angle of about 96@xmath19 for bonds involving a cu1 site and an average angle of about 118@xmath19 for bonds within the cu2-cu3 distorted kagome plane .",
    "( while the distorted lattice structure leads to some further variation within these averages , the differences are small compared to the difference in average angles for the in - plane and between - plane cases . ) on the basis of these differences , it has been suggested that clinoatacamite should be thought of as a very - anisotropic pyrochlore ( quasi-2d)-lattice heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic kagome planes weakly coupled to triangular planes .",
    "@xcite within this scenario , and based on bond angle considerations , the exchange interaction between layers is likely ferromagnetic and about one order of magnitude smaller than the antiferromagnetic in - plane one .",
    "other works have emphasized the @xmath20-oh bridging geometry of clinoatacamite , and suggested that the material is best thought of as a distorted pyrochlore magnet with exchange interactions that are comparable in the kagome planes as well as between the kagome and triangular planes .",

    "[ sec:3d ] in the thermodynamic limit is very demanding using linked - cluster expansions .",
    "hence , we will also model this material using a two - dimensional geometry consisting of a two - layer system of kagome and triangular planes , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dclusters ] .",
    "for such a model , we can straightforwardly implement a numerical linked - cluster expansion , as explained below .",
    "we will show that this simple approximation leads to a very good agreement between the experimental uniform susceptibility and the theoretical results .        in order to perform a nlce study of such a two - dimensional model , we start with the heisenberg hamiltonian on the checkerboard lattice , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the spin-@xmath7 vector at site @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the strength of the exchange interaction on each bond that connects sites @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "throughout the paper , the largest exchange interaction in each case study sets the unit of energy .",
    "we consider three different types of bonds on the lattice , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt ] .",
    "there , the red ( shaded ) areas make apparent the presence of an embedded kagome lattice in the checkerboard lattice .",

    "[ fig:2dclusters ] . finally , if @xmath29 , then one has the planar pyrochlore lattice . because of the anisotropies in the hamiltonian of eq .",

    "therefore , in the following , we implement a nlce that properly deals with the model presented here , in which some of the symmetries of the lattice are broken .    , and",
    "all other bonds are zero .",
    "if the strength of the blue ( thick ) bonds , @xmath26 , is nonzero , and the interaction on the black ( thin ) bonds , @xmath27 , is zero , then the resulting structure can represent a kagome lattice coupled to sites sitting on a triangular lattice.,width=316 ]      in linked - cluster expansions ,  @xcite an extensive property of the model per lattice site in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath30 ) is expressed in terms of contributions from all of the clusters , up to a certain size , that can be embedded in the lattice : @xmath31 the contribution from each cluster ( @xmath32 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is proportional to the weight of the cluster for that property ( @xmath33 ) , and to its multiplicity ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the weight is defined recursively as the property for each cluster ( @xmath35 ) , minus the weights of all of its subclusters , @xmath36 and the multiplicity is defined as the number of ways that particular cluster can be embedded in the infinite lattice , per site .",
    "symmetries of the lattice are often used in identifying topologically distinct clusters and in computing their multiplicities .",
    "this results in major simplifications of the algorithm and usually allows for access to larger clusters in the series . here , we implement nlces , where @xmath37 is computed by means of full exact diagonalization,@xcite for lattice models that break some of the point - group and/or translational symmetries of the underlying lattice . in",
    "what follows , we discuss how essentially the same expansion as for the symmetric case can be used for the latter cases .    as an example , let us consider the uniform checkerboard lattice . in the first order of the square expansion , a single crossed square has a multiplicity of @xmath38 ( refs .",
    ", ) since the number of ways it can be embedded in the lattice is half the number of sites .",
    "in the second order , the only distinct cluster consists of two corner - sharing crossed squares .",
    "this cluster has a multiplicity of @xmath39 , where the extra factor of two comes from the two possibilities for its orientation on the lattice ( related by a @xmath40 rotation ) , and so on.@xcite now , consider the anisotropic lattice of fig .",
    "[ fig : latt ] where , in general , @xmath41 . in this case",
    ", the translational symmetries are reduced by a factor of two , and the point - group symmetries are reduced by a factor of four , from those of the isotropic checkerboard lattice .",
    "so , the square expansion basis used for the isotropic case can not be used for this lattice anymore , since the topological clusters and the multiplicities have changed .    the goal is to rearrange the terms in the series to be able to use the square expansion basis of the isotropic lattice without having to redefine the topological clusters and their subclusters .",
    "examining the problem more carefully reveals that the new lattice can still be tiled by considering two different building blocks , as opposed to one crossed square for the uniform lattice , which is a direct consequence of the factor - of - two reduction in translational symmetries .",
    "these two blocks are numbered @xmath42 and @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt ] .",
    "so , in the first order , one has two distinct clusters in the sum , each with a multiplicity that is half of that of the single block in the first order of the isotropic case .",
    "this trend continues in higher orders as for example , in the second order , there will be four distinct clusters , as opposed to one in the isotropic case , with subclusters that are the two blocks in the first order .",
    "but , just like in the first order , the multiplicities for each cluster are reduced by a factor proportional to the increasing factor in the number of clusters ( four for the second order ) .",
    "moreover , the pool of subclusters of these four clusters contains the same number of clusters of each type in the first order , namely , four from each of the two building blocks .",
    "the above argument implies that in the expansion for the less symmetric checkerboard lattice , we will have different _ realizations _ of clusters that existed in the expansion for the symmetric lattice , and that the latter expansion is applicable to the anisotropic case if the weight of each cluster is replaced by the average weight of those realizations .",
    "it is easy to see that the maximum number of topologically distinct realizations of clusters in the isotropic square expansion for the lattice of fig .",
    "[ fig : latt ] will be eight .",
    "this number is the same factor by which the point - group and translational symmetries are reduced from that of the isotropic checkerboard lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt ] , we have generated the eight realizations in the first order ( among which only two are topologically distinct ) .",
    "each of these building blocks can serve as the starting block in the same algorithm that generates all of the clusters in the expansion for the isotropic case .",
    "in fact , this guarantees the generation of the eight realizations for every cluster in the expansion .",
    "the applications of this averaging scheme in nlces are not limited to the example described here . in principle , this method can be used in any other expansion ( e.g. , site expansion , triangle expansion , etc . ) , and for any other model with a hamiltonian that breaks some symmetries of the underlying lattice . in the following section",
