    "aquila x1(=v1333 aquilae ) is a soft x - ray transient source that shows x - ray bursts ( koyama et al .",
    "1981 ; czerny , czerny & grindlay 1987 ) , thereby indicating that the compact object is a neutron star . from quiescent observationss",
    "the companion star has been identified to be a v=19.2 k - type star .",
    "the optical counterpart brightens by @xmath325 magnitudes during x - ray outbursts which is interpreted as reprocessing of radiation in the accretion disk ( thorstensen , charles & bowyer 1978 , hereafter tcb ; canizares , mcclintock & grindlay 1979 ; charles et al .",
    "1980 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "1980 ) .",
    "attempts to find the orbital period have revealed many variations but no firm period .",
    "watson ( 1976 ) reported an unconfirmed 1.3 day x - ray periodicity during the 1975 outburst .",
    "chevalier & ilovaisky ( 1991 ) have obtained an 18.97 hr periodicity from optical photometry during its active state , which they interpret as being the orbital period .",
    "tcb observed the optical counterpart in its low state .",
    "they found the only significant feature in the spectrum was the mg@xmath4 5175  blend in absorption ; no balmer lines were evident .",
    "they concluded that the spectrum is characteristic of a k0 - 3 v star .",
    "shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also obtained low resolution spectra of aql x1 in quiescence .",
    "they too found the mg@xmath4 absorption blend but also h@xmath1 and the paschen series in emission .",
    "they found by fitting the continuum spectrum that it could be best described by a k5 star .",
    "aql x1 is known to undergo regular x - ray and optical ourbursts on a timescale of @xmath31 year ( kaluzienski et al .",
    "1977 ; priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ; charles et al .",
    "1980 ) much more frequently than the other neutron star transient cen x4 ( mcclintock & remillard 1990 ) .",
    "recently the rxte all sky monitor showed aql x1 to be have undergone an x - ray outburst between late january and early march 1997 ( levine & thomas 1997 ) .",
    "ilovaisky & chevalier ( 1997 ) reported that aql x1 was optically in quiescence by 30 march 1997 .",
    "in this letter we report on our medium resolution spectra of aql x1 obtained in may 1997 , when the source was in quiescence .",
    "we were able to determine the spectral type of the companion star and also its rotation speed .",
    "we obtained intermediate resolution spectra of aql x1 on 13 may 1997 using the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope at siding spring , australia . a tek 1024@xmath5 ccd attached to the rgo spectrograph was used during all the observations .",
    "the 600v grating was centered at 5190  giving a dispersion of 1.55   pixel@xmath6 and a spectral resolution of 3.6(fwhm=165 km s@xmath6 at h@xmath1 ) .",
    "we took 10 spectra of aql x1 each with an exposure time of 1800 secs starting at 14:58 ut with interspaced cu - ar arc spectra for wavelength calibration .",
    "template field stars of a variety of spectral types were also observed .",
    "the data reduction and analysis was performed using the starlink figaro package , the pamela routines of k.horne and the molly package of t.r .",
    "removal of the individual bias signal was achieved through subtraction of the mean overscan level on each frame .",
    "this was acceptable since an examination of the bias frames showed no significant structure .",
    "small scale pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations were removed by multiplying by a flat - field frame prepared from observations of a tungsten lamp .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted using the optimal algorithm of horne ( 1986 ) , and calibration of the wavelength scale was achieved using 4th order polynomial fits giving an rms scatter of 1/12th of a pixel ( 0.13 ) .",
    "we determine the spectral type of the companion star by minimizing the residuals after subtracting different template star spectra from the doppler - corrected average spectrum .",
    "this method is sensitive to the rotational broadening @xmath7 and the fractional contribution of the companion star to the total flux ( @xmath8 ; 1-@xmath8 is the `` veiling factor '' ) .",
    "first we determined the velocity shift of the individual spectra of aql x1 with respect to each template star spectrum by the method of cross - correlation ( tonry & davis 1979 ) . the aql x1 spectra were then interpolated onto a logarithmic wavelength scale ( pixel size 80 ) using a @xmath9 interpolation scheme to minimize data smoothing ( stover et al .",
    "no significant velocity variations were observed ( see section 4 ) , so we averaged the aql x1 spectra to the rest frame of the template star .    in order to determine the rotational broadening @xmath7 we follow the procedure described by marsh , robinson & wood ( 1994 ) .",
    "basically we subtracted a constant representing the fraction of light from the template star , multiplied by a rotationally broadened version of that template star .",
    "we broadened the template star spectrum from 0 to 200 km  s@xmath6 in steps of 1 km  s@xmath6 using the gray rotation profile ( gray 1976 ) .",
    "we then performed an optimal subtraction between the broadened template and averaged aql x1 spectra .",
    "the optimal subtraction routine adjusts the constant to minimize the residual scatter between the spectra .",
    "the scatter is measured by carrying out the subtraction and then computing the @xmath10 between this and a smoothed version of itself .",
    "the constant , @xmath8 , represents the fraction of light arising from the template spectrum , i.e. the secondary star .",
    "the optimal values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are obtained by minimising @xmath10 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the above analysis was performed in the spectral range 51206710  excluding the h@xmath1 emission line and the interstellar feature at 5190  .",
    "a linear limb - darkening coefficient of 0.76 was used ( al - naimiy 1978 ) appropriate for 6000   and an effective temperature of 4500 k ( typical for a k star ) .",
    "we also performed the above analysis using zero and full limb - darkening and only obtained a change in @xmath7 of at most 4 .    from table 1",
    "it can be seen that the minimum @xmath10 occurs at spectral type k1 with a @xmath7 of 62@xmath11 ( 1-@xmath12 ) and the companion star contributing about 94% to the observed flux at @xmath3 6000  .",
    "1 shows the results of the optimal subtraction and the @xmath10 ",
    "@xmath7 plot is shown in fig .",
    "all the template stars used in the above analysis were of luminosity class @xmath13 .",
    "the effects of using different luminosity class spectra in the analysis was estimated by comparing the absorption line flux density of stars of different spectral type and class .",
    "we find using template stars of spectral type k1 , k4 and k7 and luminosity class @xmath14 and @xmath13 , the flux density of the stars of different luminosity class ( but the same spectral type ) are only different at the 1 percent level .",
    "therefore , the value we obtain for @xmath8 in the above analysis is not dependant on the luminosity class of the template star used .    in order to verify the validity of the minimum in the @xmath10 ",
    "@xmath7 plots we performed the same analysis on a template star .",
    "the broadening in the template star spectrum is dominated by the instrumental broadening . to this template star we added noise to produce a spectrum of comparable quality to our aql x1 data .",
    "the above broadening and optimal subtraction procedure was then repeated , the results are shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the minimum @xmath10 occurs when no broadening is used .",
    "this is exactly as expected since the template star spectrum must be dominated by instrumental broadening .",
    "therefore we are confident that the minimum @xmath10 for the aql x1 spectrum is real , although the errors in the @xmath7 determination are large .",
    "in fig . 1 we show the variance - weighted average of the aql x1 spectra , which has a signal - to - noise ratio of about 25 in the continuum .",
    "the most noticeable feature is double peaked h@xmath1 emission which has a broad base ( fwzi@xmath32000 ) .",
    "we tried to see if there was any velocity variation in the absorption lines by cross - correlating the individual aql x1 spectra with a template star ( hr 807 ) , but found no significant variation over the 5 hr baseline .",
    "therefore we quote the mean heliocentric systemic velocity obtained from the averaged aql x1 spectrum of 57@xmath1521(the template star used , hr 807 , had a heliocentric velocity of 15@xmath1516 ) . again from the averaged aql x1 spectrum the equivalent width of h@xmath1 is 5.3@xmath150.3 with a mean heliocentric velocity of 99@xmath1530 , obtained using a single gaussian fit .",
    "after subtracting the spectrum of the companion star from the aql x1 spectrum , the most noticable feature is the single peaked h@xmath1 emission line ( presumably arising from the accretion disc ) with a fwhm velocity of 816@xmath1540(see fig .",
    "this is in contrast to the observed aql x1 spectrum which shows a double - peaked profile , implying that the core of the double - peaked profile is due to the h@xmath1 absorption line arising from the secondary star .",
    "we can compare the accretion disc h@xmath1 emission line in aql x1 with that in cen x4 since both have neutron star primaries and probably similar orbital periods .",
    "the width of the disc h@xmath1 emission line in cen x4 is 687@xmath1520(fwhm ; casares et al .",
    "1997 ) whereas it is broader in aql x1 , which suggests that the binary inclination of aql x1 may be higher than that of cen x4 .",
    "if we assume keplerian motion in the accretion disc and that the mass of the compact object , and orbital period of the two systems are comparable , then the velocities in the disc simply scale with @xmath16 ( frank , king & raine 1992 ) . using the velocity widths given above for aql x1 and cen x4 and the binary inclination for cen x4 ( 40@xmath17 ; shahbaz , naylor & charles 1993 ) , we estimate @xmath18 for aql x1 .",
    "it should however , be noted that the assumption of keplerian velocities at the outer edge of the disc may not hold ( orosz et al .",
    "1994 ) . for a system at such an inclination",
    "one might have expected to see a double - peaked emission line profile , arising from an accretion disk viewed at high inclination .",
    "however , there are probably other sources of h@xmath1 emission from the system which contaminate the disc profile , such as from the heated face of the secondary star or from the bright spot .",
    "also note the poor resolution and signal - to - noise of our data , therefore we can not rule out a high binary inclination on the lack of a double - peaked profile alone .",
    "if the orbital period is 18.97 hr and the secondary star fills its roche lobe , then the density of the secondary star is @xmath20=0.3 g  @xmath21 . a k1 main sequence star would have @xmath20=1.9 g  @xmath21 . , implying that the radius of the secondary star must be about twice that of a main sequence star in order for it to fill its roche lobe .",
    "it is therefore likely to be evolved , similar to the secondary star in cen x4 ( shahbaz , naylor & charles 1993 ) .",
    "if we believe the estimate to the binary inclination to be @xmath2 , and that both systems have similar mass compact objects , then one can estimate @xmath19 for aql x-1 ( @xmath19 scales with @xmath16 c.f . the mass function equation ) . using @xmath19=146 ( mcclintock & remillard 1990 ) and @xmath22 for cen x4 and @xmath23 for aql x1 we estimate @xmath19 for aql x1 to be @xmath3170 .",
    "using medium resolution optical spectra , we have determined the spectral type of the companion star in the neutron star x - ray transient system aql x1 , to be a k1 star . by optimally subtracting different broadened versions of the companion star spectrum from the average aql x1 spectrum we determine the rotational broadening of the companion star to be @xmath0 , with a contamination of @xmath3 6% to the observed flux at 6000 .",
    "we also estimate the binary inclination to be @xmath2 by measuring the width of the accretion disc h@xmath1 emission line , and @xmath19 to be @xmath3 170 .",
    "we are grateful to all the staff at the aat , siding spring in particular our telescope operator jonathan pogson .",
    "the data reduction was carried out on the oxford starlink node , and the figures were plotted using the @xmath24 software ."
