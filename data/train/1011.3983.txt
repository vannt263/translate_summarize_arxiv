    "the dispersal of young stars out into the field and whether or not there are kinematically - related groups of stars in the solar neighbourhood is one of the open problems in galactic astrophysics .",
    "although stars do not form isolated but within clusters and associations , most of them end up in the field .",
    "once scattered through the galaxy , these young stars are difficult to identify .",
    "eggen @xcite assumed that clusters form a halo of evaporated stars . during its disintegration",
    ", the whole group can not be identified although within some regions one can found stars moving in the same direction and at the same rate .",
    "this idea gave rise to the concept of moving group or stellar kinematic group ( hereafter skg ) .",
    "+ the idea of a moving group as a group of stars sharing a common origin has been the subject of an intense discussion .",
    "it is now , however , well established that the `` classical '' moving groups ( e.g. hyades , ursa major ) are in reality a mixture of two different populations : a group of coeval stars ( related to the halo of an evaporating cluster ) and a second group with a dynamical ( resonant ) origin ( e.g. famaey et al .",
    "+ identifying stars with a common origin ( i.e. same kinematics , same age , same chemical composition ) is only possible if a combination of techniques are used .",
    "nearby - late type stars are excellent targets for this kind of study since i ) their spectra is full of narrow absorption lines , allowing determination of accurate radial velocities , and ii ) it is unlikely that an old star by chance shares chromospheric indices or a lithium abundance similar to those of young solar - like stars .",
    "in a recent work , maldonado et al . @xcite studied a sample of 405 nearby late - type stars , attempting to identify unambiguous skgs members by analysing high - resolution ( r@xmath157000 ) echelle spectra obtained in 2 - 3 meters class telescopes .",
    "the study is focused in nearby ( distances less than 25 pc ) , main - sequence ( luminosity class v / iv - v ) , late - type ( spectral types fgk ) stars .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue @xcite is used as a reference . to identify stars in skgs , maldonado et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed both the kinematics and the spectroscopic age indicators .",
    "radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating , using the iraf routine _ fxcor _ , the spectra of the program stars with spectra of radial velocity standard stars of similar spectral types . for those known",
    "spectroscopic binaries , the radial velocity of the centre of mass of the system were considered .",
    "typical uncertainties are between 0.15 and 0.25 @xmath2 .",
    "these radial velocities were used together with hipparcos parallaxes @xcite and tycho-2 proper motions @xcite to compute the galactic - spatial velocity components @xmath3 , as explained in montes et al .",
    "+ young stars are assembled in an specific region of the @xmath4 plane @xmath5 , although the shape is not a square ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "possible members of skgs are selected allowing a dispersion of 8 @xmath6 in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 components with respect to the central position of the skg .",
    "the same dispersion is considered when taking the @xmath9 component into account .",
    "the final number of candidates for each skg is given in table  [ tab1 ] ( column 4 ) .",
    "@xmath4 plane .",
    "different colours and symbols indicate membership to different skgs .",
    "large crosses represent the convergence point of the young skgs shown in the figure as given by montes et al . @xcite .",
    "the dotted line represents the boundary of the young disc population .",
    "figure from maldonado et al .",
    "]      members of a given skg should be coeval and since clusters disperse on time scales of a few hundred years they should also be moderately young ( @xmath1 50 - 650 myr ) . the classic method to compute the stellar age ( i.e. evolutionary tracks )",
    "does not work good enough for the latest spectral types .",
    "however , late - type stars show other properties which can be used to determine their age : + * lithium abundance : * an age estimate of late - type stars can be carried out by comparing their li  i 6707.8 equivalent width with those of stars in well known young open clusters of different ages ( e.g. maldonado et al .",
    ", montes et al .",
    "nevertheless , it should be regarded as an additional age indicator since the relation lithium - age is poor constrain and biased towards younger ages .",
    "* age derived from cromospheric activity : * there are several observables of the magnetic field of a solar - type star : chromospheric emission lines , e.g. ca  ii h , & k or ca  ii irt , or the x - ray emission from the stellar corona ( e.g. lpez - santiago et al . , martnez - arniz et al .",
    "@xcite ) in addition , there is a strong correlation between the stellar rotation and the chromospheric activity in cool stars ( e.g. montesinos et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this way",
    ", the stellar age can be estimated ( mamajek & hillenbrand @xcite , garcs et al .",
    "@xcite ) :    * by using the index @xmath0 which is a measure of the cromospheric emission in the cores of the ca  ii h , & k absorption lines , normalised to the total bolometric emission of the star . * by searching for x - ray counterparts in the rosat catalogue . * from the rotational period of the star ( gyrochronology )",
    "the agreement between the different activity - age estimates is overall good , as can be seen in fig .",
    "chromospheric age shows an enhancement of the star formation rate in the last 2 gyr , then the distribution becomes more or less flat .",
    "rosat ages are biased towards stars younger than 3 - 4 gyr ; i.e. , older stars have negligible ( or undetectable ) x - ray emission , and therefore their distribution does not offer information on the stellar formation history . as far as rotational ages are concerned , there are not enough stars with measured rotational periods to draw robust conclusions . + a summary of the ages obtained ( percentages of stars according to their ages for each age - indicator ) can be seen in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "age distribution for chromospheric - derived ages ( upper panel ) , rosat ages ( middle panel ) , and rotational ages ( lower panel ) .",
    "figure from maldonado et al .",
    "from a total sample of 405 stars , maldonado et al . @xcite identify 102 stars which share the same kinematics that those stars in skgs ( i.e. @xmath1 25% of the sample ) .",
    "in addition , 78 stars are classified as _ other young discs stars _ ( i.e. stars which are in the boundaries of the young disc population but without a clear identification to some of the skgs ) . from them , 36 have ages that agree with the accepted ages of the corresponding moving group .",
    "that means that only @xmath110% of the nearby late - type stars can be associated to skgs .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarises the number of kinematic candidates to the different skgs and the final number of possible members and no - members of each of the skgs studied in maldonado et al .",
    "+ list of young stars in skgs can be very useful for further investigations .",
    "some examples include search for solar analogues , substellar companions , study of the flux - flux and rotation - activity - age relationships in groups of stars with different ages ( martnez - arniz et al .",
    "@xcite ) or search for cold faint dusty debris discs ( e.g. the dunes project , eiroa et al . , @xcite , montesinos et al .",
