    "a neutron - star low - mass x - ray binary ( ns - lmxb , or hereafter simply lmxb ) consists of a mass accreting neutron star ( ns ) and a mass - donating low - mass star which fills the binary roche lobe .",
    "it is well known that these objects show bimodality in x - ray spectral states , namely soft and hard states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the soft state when the mass accretion rate is high ,",
    "mass from the companion spirals onto the ns through a standard accretion disk @xcite which is optically thick and geometrically thin .",
    "the spectrum is soft , which we can describe by the canonical model of @xcite : a disk blackbody with a temperature of @xmath51 kev , plus a blackbody from the ns surface with a temperature of @xmath5 2 kev .",
    "the latter component is often found to be weakly comptonized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "over the past three decades , this model has been reinforced by a number of studies including , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when the accretion rate is low and the source is in the hard state , the inner accretion disk transites into an optically thin and geometrically thick flow around the ns , which is further characterized by a large radial velocity component , a nearly free - fall ion temperature , and possibly a significant difference between the ion and electron temperatures .",
    "the hot electrons therein strongly comptonize the ns blackbody emission and harden the spectrum to @xmath7 100 kev @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these  normal \" objects , a special kind of lmxbs with high inclination angles , namely dipping lmxbs ( also called dippers ) showing periodic dips in their x - ray intensity , seldom have their spectral states investigated . for a long time , their dips were thought to be caused by progressive covering of a largely extended scattering region called accretion disk corona ( adc , * ? ? ? * ) by the companion star ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , new studies revealed that the dips can be explained simply by obscuration of the central compact x - ray source by an ionized and extended absorber located at some outer parts of the accretion disk @xcite , and the adc is no longer required .",
    "based on the new scenario , it is reasonable to consider dipping lmxbs essentially the same objects as non - dipping lmxbs , except for their higher inclinations .",
    "hence it is worthwhile to examine whether we can understand dippers in the same spectral classification scheme as for non - dipping lmxbs , possibly with some modifications .",
    "so far , broad - band spectra of dipping lmxbs were studied extensively , e.g. , with bepposax .",
    "examples include relatively luminous dippers 4u 1915 - 05 @xcite , xb 1254 - 690 @xcite and xb 1658 - 298 @xcite , as well as dimmer ones such as xb 1323 - 619 @xcite and exo 0748 - 676 @xcite .",
    "the reported spectra are generally rather hard , often extending to @xmath5 100 kev , which are reminiscent of the hard state of non - dipping lmxbs .",
    "however , these previous works did not clearly specify whether the objects were in the hard state or not .",
    "since dippers , like the other lmxbs , must be distributed over the two states , we presume that some of them actually reside in the soft state , and their broad - band spectra appear harder because , e.g. , their higher inclination leads to a stronger comptonization . to examine this possibility , we need to analyze broad - band non - dipping spectra of some appropriate dippers in a unified way which is consistent with the study of non - dipping objects .",
    "the available publications are clearly inadequate for this purpose , because different authors employed different modelings .    for the above purpose , we need to use an x - ray instrument with a high spectral resolution and broad - band coverage .",
    "the most suited one is the japanese satellite suzaku @xcite , which has a soft x - ray energy resolution of @xmath8 ev realized by the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an energy coverage up to @xmath9 100 kev achieved by the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , five dipping lmxbs have been observed in total with suzaku , and among them , we selected the most luminous one 4u 1915 - 05 ( see section [ sec : observation ] for details ) .",
    "this source is the first dipper discovered in 1982 @xcite , showing stable periodic dips with a period of @xmath10 mins @xcite , and frequent type i x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "it is also known as an ultracompact x - ray binary ( ucxb ) which has a helium rich donor star @xcite .",
    "its 0.6 - 10 kev persistent luminosity , was @xmath11 erg s@xmath1 @xcite at an assumed distance of 9.3 kpc ( see below ) , reached the range typical of lmxbs in the soft state .",
    "the broadband spectrum of this source was studied by @xcite using bepposax . by fitting a 0.5 - 200 kev spectrum with a cut - off power - law model",
    ", these authors reported a rather high cut - off energy of @xmath5 80 kev , which is suggestive of strong comptonization .",
    "however , further exploration with other x - ray satellites ( e.g. , rosat , chandra , xmm - newton ) did not give much improved knowledge of this issue due to their limited energy coverage @xcite .",
    "furthermore , few of these studies attempted spectral classification of this object in comparison with non - dipping lmxbs .    in the present paper , we utilized an archival suzaku data set of 4u 1915 - 05 acquired on 2006 november 8 .",
    "we focus on its non - dip broadband spectral properties , while the x - ray dips are out of the scope of our study . throughout the paper , the source distance",
    "is assumed to be 9.3 kpc , as determined by @xcite with an uncertainty of @xmath12% , using the x - ray bursts as a standard candle . using the same method ,",
    "other studies gave similar values of 8.4 - 10.8 kpc @xcite and 7 - 9 kpc @xcite ; thus , the distance uncertainty is typically 20% . since the source shows x - ray dips , but no x - ray eclipse , its inclination angle is estimated to be @xmath13 @xcite , with a @xmath14 uncertainty @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : fourdippers ] summarizes the suzaku observations of four dipping lmxbs among the five sources in the archive , excluding 4u 1822 - 37 which has been found to have strong magnetic field ( @xmath5 12 g ; * ? ? ?",
    "we estimated their 1 - 50 kev luminosities , by fitting their background subtracted spectra with an absorbed cut - off power - law model , and then removing the absorption .",
    "the bolometric corrections , which depend on the cutoff energy , are typically smaller than 1.3 .",
    "thus , among the four dippers observed with suzaku , 4u 1915 - 05 is the most luminous , and hence is suited to our purpose of identifying a dipping lmxb in the soft state .       @xmath15 the 0.8 - 10 kev xis spectrum and 15 - 40 kev hxd - pin spectrum",
    "were fitted simultaneously .",
    "the quoted errors refer to 90% confidence limits .",
    "+ @xmath16 another edge was found around 3.4 kev , which is probably an ionized argon k - edge .",
    "+ @xmath17 @xmath18 was corrected for the inclination factor @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 was assumed .",
    "+ @xmath21 definition of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the same as in table [ tab : totalspectra ] , however the unit is @xmath25 erg @xmath26 s@xmath1 ."

    "<S> the dipping low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1915 - 05 was observed by suzaku on 2007 november 8 for a net exposure of 39 ksec . </S>",
    "<S> it was detected by the xis with a 0.8 - 10 kev signal rate of @xmath0 cts s@xmath1 per camera , and hxd - pin with a 12 - 45 kev signal rate of @xmath2 cts s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> after removing the periodic dips and an x - ray burst , the 0.8  45 kev continuum was successfully described by an optically thick disk emission with an inner - disk temperature @xmath3 kev and a neutron - star blackbody emission with a temperature @xmath4 kev , on condition that the blackbody component , or possibly the disk emission too , is significantly comptonized . </S>",
    "<S> this successful modeling is consistent with 4u 1915 - 05 being in a high - soft state in this observation , and implies that its broadband spectrum can be interpreted in the same scheme as for many non - dipping low - mass x - ray binaries in the soft state . </S>",
    "<S> its bolometric luminosity ( @xmath5 0.02 times the eddington limit ) is relatively low for the soft state , but within a tolerance , if considering the distance and inclination uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> as a high - inclination binary , this source exhibited stronger comptonization effect , with a larger comptonizing @xmath6-parameter , compared to low and medium inclination binaries . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the comptonizing coronae of these objects in the soft state is in an oblate ( rather than spherical ) shape , extending along the accretion disk plane , because the @xmath6-parameter would not depend on the inclination if the corona were spherical . </S>"
