    "the origin of magnetism in itinerant ferromagnets has been object of concern in last years @xcite . in an previous work",
    "@xcite we have developed a two band symmetric model to describe the effect of coulomb correlation in these metals .",
    "it consisted of a hubbard like narrow band ( band @xmath1 ) with intrasite coulomb interaction u , hybridized with another band , which is broad and uncorrelated ( band @xmath2 ) , through the hybridization coupling @xmath3 .",
    "now we allow a shift between the centers of the two bands in order to describe a more general and realistic band strucuture ; we also let the band @xmath2 width varies . both have strong influence on the kind of magnetic state of the metal .    as in roth",
    "s approach@xcite , the correlation is present in only one site ( say , the origin ) , while in the others acts an effective spin and energy dependent but site independent field , the self - energy @xmath4 .",
    "this field is self - consistently determined by imposing the vanishing of the scattering @xmath5 matrix associated to the origin , thus restoring the translational invariance of the host .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denotes spin .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the tunneling amplitudes between neighboring sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in each band .",
    "even with this single - site approximation ( ssa ) , @xmath12 describes in a quite satisfactory way the physics of these systems but we still need to resort to further approximations . and these include the decoupling in the green function and the self consistency generated by the vanishing of the scattering @xmath5 matrix .",
    "the main equations we get are : @xmath13 the green function of the @xmath1 band , where @xmath14 is the recursion relation of the renormalized @xmath1 band and @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the bare bands , with @xmath17 in this paper we use @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in arbitrary energy units .",
    "all energy magnitudes are taken in units of @xmath20 , making them dimensionless .",
    "the bare @xmath1 band width is then @xmath21 .",
    "we use homothetic bands @xmath22 @xmath23 is the center of the @xmath2 band and represents a shift in the bands .",
    "@xmath24 is a phenomenological parameter describing the ratio of the effective masses of the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 electrons . from now on we take @xmath25 and @xmath26 real and constant independent of @xmath27 .    in fig .",
    "[ bare ] we display typical value for the density of states ( dos ) of the bare bands when @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    [ bare ]     and @xmath2 bands ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) for @xmath32 and @xmath29.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the vanishing of the t - matrix gives a self - consistent equation for the self - energy : @xmath33 with @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an initial guess for @xmath1-band occupation number at the origin .",
    "the self - consistency is performed both in @xmath36 and in @xmath37 , for each total occupation @xmath38 .",
    "the total number of electrons per site is a constant of motion .",
    "the self - consistency and the dynamics distribute the electrons among @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , eventually producing a ferromagnetic state ( it turns out that the @xmath2-band is allways paramagnetic for the range of parameters used in this work ) .",
    "we want now to exhibit the combined effect of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath24 and @xmath23 on this process at @xmath44 .",
    "the effect of @xmath43 and @xmath23 , apart from transfering electrons from one band to the other , is to produce band broadening@xcite in both bands .    in fig .",
    "[ conv ] it can be seen the process by which an initial guess , denoted by the point @xmath45 , labeled @xmath46 , converges , here after five steps , for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , to point @xmath51 , whose coordinates differ from those of point @xmath52 by less than @xmath53 . in some situations",
    "the number of steps needed to achieving convergence may be larger .     and",
    "point @xmath46 was our initial guess for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then the path @xmath57 is generated in the process . only in the last step",
    "the coordinates of the output , point @xmath51 , differ from that of the previous point , @xmath52 , by less than @xmath53.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ nd2 ] we plot the converged values of @xmath58,@xmath59 in an interval of @xmath0 for @xmath60 , @xmath48 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for @xmath0 less than @xmath61",
    "the system is basically paramagnetic .      in fig .",
    "[ nanb ] we exhibit the ratio of @xmath62 versus @xmath0 as obtained from the process of convergence and self - consistency .",
    "here @xmath60 , @xmath48 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is seen that for small @xmath0 the method distributes most of the electrons into the @xmath1-band .          in fig .",
    "[ mag ] it is plotted magnetization versus @xmath0 when @xmath60 , @xmath48 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in agreement with fig .",
    "[ nd2 ] the magnetization starts at @xmath66 and increases monotonically up to @xmath56 .",
    "for the same values of parameters the internal energy of the ferromagnetic state is compared with that of the paramagnetic one in fig .",
    "[ elivre ] , for the same range of @xmath0 .",
    "the difference between them is rather small and oscilatting with @xmath0 .",
    "several factors influence on this : the small separation of the correlated @xmath67 bands and the contibution of the uncorrelated @xmath2 band , which may be of the same order in both states and even overcomes the contribution of the @xmath1 band for some occupation @xmath0 . from fig .",
    "[ dosab ] it can be seen that the @xmath2 band contribution competes with the one from the @xmath1 band if @xmath68 crosses the hubbard gap .",
    "so we expect that band degeneracy may be crucial to stabilize the ferromagnetic state .     and @xmath2 bands .",
    "the latter is non magnetic .",
    "here @xmath60 , @xmath48 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath69 .",
    "the fermi energy is at @xmath70 and the magnetization is @xmath71 .",
