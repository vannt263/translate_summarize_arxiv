    "although the dark matter has been gravitationally confirmed by astrophysical observations in various way , one has no information on the properties , e.g. , the mass and the coupling . in a various dark matter models ,",
    "a kind of popular model includes a light new boson which mediates between the standard model and a dark sector , e.g. ,  ref .",
    "such a light particle simultaneously plays an important role in order to solve several problems , for instance , the small scale structure problems  @xcite , the lithium problem  @xcite , and the muon @xmath1 anomaly  @xcite .",
    "recently , a @xmath0be nuclear transition experiment has reported a signal which can be interpreted as an unknown light vector boson  @xcite .",
    "the vector boson ( @xmath2 ) is observed as a resonance in @xmath3 pairs whose invariant mass is @xmath4mev .",
    "if one supposes a purely vector interaction between the standard model matter fields and the light vector boson , the consistency in the other experimental results requires the interaction should be protophobic  @xcite , which can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 the coupling with the neutron @xmath7 , which is defined as @xmath8 , satisfies @xmath9 .",
    "on the other hand , the coupling with proton @xmath10 is restricted as @xmath11 .",
    "we fix the couplings as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 in the following discussion .",
    "phenomenology of the @xmath2 boson and their models have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we assume the light vector boson to be a gauge boson of a broken u(1)@xmath16 gauge symmetry and to be a mediator between the standard model and the dark sector which includes the dark matter , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . using some simple models ,",
    "we investigate experimental constraints on their parameters in the dark sector , and also discuss the compatibility with the thermal relic dark matter scenario .",
    "as the dark sector , we consider a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the u(1)@xmath16 gauge symmetry by a dark higgs @xmath17 , which is a complex scalar boson charged under u(1)@xmath16 .",
    "the lagrangian of the dark sector is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the field strength tensor of @xmath2 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath17 is expanded as @xmath20 in the unitarity gauge , and @xmath21 .",
    "some terms irrelevant in our computation are suppressed here .",
    "the parameters are defined as @xmath22 the original parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be written by @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the gauge coupling @xmath27 . for simplicity , we consider that interactions between the higgs boson and the dark sector can be neglected  @xcite .",
    "first , we study a complex scalar and a dirac fermion dark matter models , where the dark matters are charged under u(1)@xmath16 .",
    "if the dark matter is the complex scalar field @xmath28 , the lagrangian is @xmath29 since the annihilation into @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the s - wave processes , they dominate the thermal relic abundance . in this model ,",
    "the experimental bounds on these two channels are , in addition to the dark matter mass @xmath32 , determined by the couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the annihilation cross section at the dark age ( @xmath35 ) is bounded by an observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the planck as @xmath36@xmath37/s / gev  @xcite .",
    "hence , the region where the dark matter is lighter than 30 gev is naively excluded by the result .",
    "even if the dark matter is heavier than the value , the large sommerfeld enhancement through the @xmath2 boson excludes the thermal relic scenario @xcite .",
    "the similar bound is obtained by ams-02 for the region @xmath38",
    "@xcite with @xmath39 .",
    "these indirect signals are 1- or 2-step cascades studied in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the region is also excluded by the direct detection result of the lux experiment  @xcite . in order to see these bounds ,",
    "we have followed the analysis method used in refs .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : directcoupling ] .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider only the @xmath31 channel in the figure , so that , only @xmath40 is relevant coupling .",
    "the result can be translated into the @xmath30 channel with the replacement of @xmath41 by @xmath42 in their non - relativistic annihilation cross sections .",
    "even if the both of the channels contribute to the annihilation process , the thermal relic dark matter can not be obtained .",
    "note that recently ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that if the dark matter is lighter than the vector boson a certain parameter region can explain the thermal relic abundance , see fig .",
    "[ fig : directcoupling ] .    considering the dirac fermion dark matter @xmath43 ,",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath44 where @xmath43 is the dark matter .",
    "the dark matter annihilates through the s - wave processes into @xmath31 and @xmath45 .",
    "the situation of the experimental bounds and the consequence for the thermal relic scenario are the same with @xmath28 , except for the light dark matter window .",
    "the non - relativistic annihilation cross section of @xmath46 is just a half of the cross section of @xmath47 if @xmath48 , while the result of the @xmath45 channel is give by the replacement of @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "since the sommerfeld enhancement factor is the same with @xmath28 , the result is almost the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : directcoupling ] , so that the thermal relic scenario is also excluded .",
    "next , we study the u(1)@xmath16 singlet dark matter models . interactions between the dark matters and the standard model are induced by the mixing with another particle charged under the u(1)@xmath16 gauge symmetry .    in the case of the real scalar dark matter",
    "@xmath51 , the dark higgs @xmath52 can be used as the mediator .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking , the lagrangian is @xmath53 where we impose a @xmath54 symmetry ( @xmath55 ) to stabilize the dark matter .",
    "the coupling @xmath56 is introduced like @xmath33 .    in the previous section",
    ", the direct detection excludes the thermal relic scenario if the dark matters is heavier than about 5gev . in this model",
    ", however , the leading contribution to the direct detection comes from the loop induced diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagramdirectdetection ] .",
    "hence , the direct detection bound becomes significantly weaker than the previous models .",
    "since the scalar three point interaction is proportional to @xmath25 , the sommerfeld enhancement factor is also suppressed by @xmath57 @xcite , unless @xmath58 .",
    "we also consider the u(1)@xmath16 singlet dark matter model including a majorana fermion @xmath59 .",
    "since the majorana fermion can not interact with @xmath17 alone , we additionally introduce a dirac fermion @xmath60 whose u(1)@xmath16 charge is the same with @xmath17 .",
    "then , the lagrangian is @xmath61 where the yukawa coupling @xmath62 can be chosen as real and positive without loss of generality .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking , the coupling becomes the source of the fermion mixing .",
    "the mass eigenstates are obtained by a so(3 ) rotation and a chiral rotation to flip the sign of a mass term as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are , respectively , the left - handed and the charge conjugation of the right - handed components in @xmath60 , namely , @xmath66 .",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath67 are the four component majorana fermions defined as @xmath68 .",
    "we assign the mass eigenvalues so as to be @xmath69 , i.e. , the dark matter is @xmath70 .",
    "then , the lagrangian is written as follows , @xmath71 where @xmath72 the mass eigenvalues are related as @xmath73 in the numerical analyses below , we chose @xmath74 to evade the complexity of the co - annihilation of the dark fermions .",
    "the leading contribution to the direct detection signal is also the loop diagram given in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagramdirectdetection ] like the real scalar model . since the s - wave annihilation channel is suppressed by @xmath75 ,",
    "the leading annihilation process is the p - wave .",
    "hence , the indirect detection bound does not work to exclude the thermal relic scenario for the majorana dark matter .",
    "even though the indirect detection bounds are too weak , the sommerfeld enhancement factor @xcite and the self - scattering cross section can be large if one takes the region of the heavy dark matter mass @xmath76 and the lighter mediator mass @xmath26 .",
    "in this situation , the large self - interaction can solve the small scale structure problems as shown in the next section .",
    "we show the indirect and the direct detection bounds of the real scalar dark matter model , and that whether they are compatible with the thermal relic abundance or not .",
    "we also investigate future prospects of the direct detection bound .",
    "the dark higgs @xmath52 mediates the annihilation into the @xmath2 pair and the direct detection as fig .",
    "[ fig : diagramdirectdetection ] . in these processes",
    ", amplitude can be written without @xmath27 . since the annihilation to @xmath30 is almost insensitive to @xmath27 , the physics of this model",
    "is described by only @xmath56 and the dark matter mass .",
    "indeed , our results are not changed in @xmath77@xmath78 .    as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : realfig1 ] , since the sommerfeld enhancement is suppressed , the cmb bound excludes the thermal relic scenario only if the dark matter is lighter than about 30gev .",
    "the electron - positron flux excludes the scenario up to the mass of about 100gev .    in this letter",
    ", we consider the case that the masses of the @xmath2 boson and the dark higgs bosons are the same scale .",
    "note that because the transfer momentum in the dark matter - nucleon scattering in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagramdirectdetection ] is also the same scale @xmath79@xmath80 , therefore the transfer - momentum contribution to the direct detection is not neglected .",
    "in addition to the lux bound in 2013  @xcite , we have also drawn their recent result  @xcite , and the prospects of the xenon1 t @xcite and the lz experiments  @xcite .",
    "evaluating the hadronic matrix elements , we have used a result of the lattice qcd simulation @xcite .",
    "it is found that the current lux bound is too weak to exclude the thermal relic scenario .",
    "the expected bound by lz can exclude the scenario up to a few hundreds gev , for @xmath81 mev .",
    "[ figreal1 ]    the dark higgs mass dependence of the expected direct detection bounds is shown in fig .",
    "[ figreal2 ] .",
    "it is found that the expected bounds by the xenon1 t and the lz experiments can exclude the scenario up to 200 gev and above 1 tev , respectively .",
    "if the dark higgs is lighter than the @xmath2 boson , the scalar decays via two off - shell states . in the case ,",
    "a loop induced decay into @xmath82 becomes the dominant channel . eventually , the life time of the dark higgs becomes larger than one second , so that the observed matter abundance could be suffered if the dark higgs abundance is too large .",
    "the direct detections can reach the higher dark matter mass for the lighter dark higgs . considering the life time of the dark higgs",
    ", the reaches decrease about 100 gev .",
    "[ figreal2 ]",
    "since the majorana dark matter mainly annihilates through the p - wave process , only the direct detection is important to restrict the thermal relic scenario .",
    "the bounds and the prospects are shown in the fig .",
    "[ figmajo ] .",
    "the yukawa coupling to obtain the thermal relic abundance becomes large , when the dark matter is heavier than the mass difference @xmath83 .",
    "below the value , the cross section is determined by the mass difference , so that the coupling is independent of the dark matter mass . recently , the region heavier than about 40 gev has been excluded for @xmath84 . with the projected experiments ,",
    "the thermal relic region is excluded until the lower limit of their sensitivity , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "similar to the real scalar dark matter case , these behavior are almost independent of @xmath27 .    considering the heavy dark higgs ,",
    "the direct detection bound becomes weaker .",
    "the current bound is not sensitive if @xmath86 , while the prospected sensitivities by the xenon1 t and the lz experiments reach the dark higgs of 200 and 350 mev , respectively .",
    "as mentioned before , the self - scattering cross section is enhanced by @xmath87 .",
    "we have calculated the velocity - averaged transfer cross section @xcite , and found that due to the enhancement , the self - interaction can be large enough to solve the small scale structure puzzles . in this case",
    ", the coupling @xmath27 should be a bit smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "the details are shown in fig .",
    "[ figself ] .",
    "in this letter , we have investigated the dark matter models where the ptotophobic 16.7mev  boson is a mediator between the standard model and the dark sector .",
    "because of the severe constraint from the cmb observation , due to the large sommerfeld enhancement , the thermal relic scenarios are almost excluded in the u(1)@xmath16 charged dark matter models .",
    "considering the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the u(1@xmath89 gauge symmetry , it is found that , when the dark matter is the u(1@xmath89 singlet , the dark matter can easily satisfy the observed relic abundance under the current experimental constraints .",
    "some parameter regions can be probed by the future direct detection experiments .",
    "particularly , in the majorana dark matter model , the large self - scattering cross section to solve the small scale structure puzzles can be achieved , while a bit small @xmath27 is required .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , a light and a long - lived particle could solve the lithium problem .",
    "hence , the parameter region where the dark higgs becomes a long - lived particle also attracts our attention  @xcite .",
