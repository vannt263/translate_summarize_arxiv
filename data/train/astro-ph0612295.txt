    "the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) is a treasury program on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , awarded a total of 640 hst orbits , carried out in two cycles ( 320 orbits in cycles 12 and 13 each ; scoville et al .",
    "2006a ; koekemoer et al . 2006 ) .",
    "cosmos is a 2 square degree imaging survey of an equatorial field in @xmath11 band , using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "the hst acs observations provide high resolution imaging to map the morphology of galaxies as a function of environment and epoch covering from high redshift ( @xmath12 ) to the nearby ( @xmath13 ) universe . since substantial large - scale structures ( e.g. , voids , filaments , groups and clusters of galaxies ) occur on scales up to 100 mpc in the comoving frame , our 2 square degree cosmos field can adequately map galaxy evolution over the full range of environments , 80.7 mpc for @xmath14 , 126.6 mpc for @xmath15 , 155.3 mpc for @xmath16 , 175.2 mpc for @xmath17 , 190.0 mpc for @xmath18 , and 201.5 mpc for @xmath19 , under a flat cosmology of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 . ] .",
    "it is also interesting to note that our survey volume at high redshift is similar to that of the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) at low redshift .    our acs survey depth",
    ", @xmath24 ab allows us to detect of the order of @xmath25 sources in the cosmos area .",
    "therefore , the cosmos project is fundamental to virtually all areas of galaxy evolution , identification of different classes of objects , evolution of large - scale structures as well as that of dark matter .",
    "in particular , the following interesting issues can be covered by our cosmos project using statistically large samples : [ 1 ] the evolution of galaxies , clusters , large - scale structure , and cold dark matter on mass scales up to @xmath26 as a function of redshift , [ 2 ] the formation , assembly , and evolution of galaxies as a function of large - scale structure environment , morphology and redshift , [ 3 ] the cosmic star formation history as a function of large - scale structure environment , morphology and redshift , and [ 4 ] detailed study of the nature , morphology and clustering properties of different populations of galaxies such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , extremely red objects , ly@xmath27 emitters ( laes ) , lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , and star - forming galaxies , and their evolution with redshift .",
    "however , to understand the whole evolution of galaxies , agns , and dark matter , it is absolutely necessary to obtain multi - wavelength observations with high spatial resolution from x - ray to radio .",
    "in particular , we need optical multi - band images of the cosmos field , as we only take @xmath11 band data with acs .",
    "therefore , ground - based optical observations are also an essential part of the cosmos project .",
    "such data will be helpful in studying stellar contents of one million galaxies at various redshifts and in estimating photometric redshifts with reasonable accuracy .",
    "this could best be accomplished by using wide - area ccd detectors on 8 m class telescopes . in this respect ,",
    "the subaru prime - focus camera , suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al . 2002 ) , on the subaru telescope ( kaifu et al . 2000 ; iye et al .",
    "2004 ) , provides its superior imaging capability because of its very wide field of view ( @xmath28 ) .    during the period january 2004",
    "to april 2005 , we obtained deep optical images of the cosmos field with suprime - cam with the following seven filters ; @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we describe these observations in detail ; see also taniguchi et al .",
    "the last filter is the narrowband filter centered at 815 nm with a fwhm of 12 nm .",
    "the broad - band data will be used to measure photometric redshifts and stellar mass ( mobasher et al .",
    "2006 ) , identify large scale structures ( scoville et al . 2006b ; guzzo et al . 2006 ) , estimate local densities ( capak et al .",
    "2006b ) and optically identify sources detected in x - ray ( hasinger et al .",
    "2006 ) , radio ( schinnerer et al .",
    "2006 ) , and infrared ( sanders et al 2006 ) wavelengths .",
    "combined with the narrow - band ( nb816 ) observations , these will be used to identify laes at @xmath29 ( murayama et al 2006 ) , [ o ii ] emitters at @xmath30 ( takahashi et al .",
    "2006 ) , and h@xmath27 emitters at @xmath31 ( shioya et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we describe in detail the observational procedures , filters , sensitivities and completeness of the cosmos subaru suprime - cam imaging ( see also taniguchi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "science investigations and their initial results are presented in the aforementioned papers . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the ab magnitude system .",
    "the cosmos field covers an area of 1.4 @xmath32 1.4 degree , centered at ra(j2000 ) = 10:00:28.6 and dec(j2000 ) = + 02:12:21.0 . the suprime - cam consists of ten @xmath33 ccd chips and provides a very wide field of view , @xmath34 in @xmath35 pixels ( 0202 pixel@xmath23 ) . despite the large field of view of the supreme - cam",
    ", we need a total of nine pointings to cover the whole cosmos area .",
    "this requires special mapping ( i.e. dithering ) patterns to carry out the imaging observations . in order to obtain accurate astrometry",
    ", we also need to arrange the patterns to overlap .",
    "furthermore , we need to take care of gaps ( @xmath36@xmath37 or @xmath38@xmath39 ) between the ccd chips of the suprime - cam . in order to save observing time ,",
    "we need an efficient mapping pattern with minimum pointings for covering the whole field of cosmos with minimizing the shallower edges around the outside of the mosaic . on one hand , in order to achieve reliable astrometry covering the whole cosmos field , it is also necessary to have a half - array shifted data set .    taking these two points into account , we use the following two mapping patterns ; pattern a and pattern c. originally , we had another pattern b. however , we did not use this in our observations . from this historical reason , we refer our two mapping patterns as pattern a and c throughout this paper .",
    "pattern a is a half - array shifted mapping method in which 12 pointings are necessary to map the whole cosmos field ; see figure 1 .",
    "the detailed dithering properties are given in table 1 .",
    "pattern c is our most efficient mapping method in which only nine pointings are enough to map the whole field ; see figure 2 .",
    "the detailed dithering properties are given in table 2 .",
    "pattern a was used with a relatively short unit exposure time ( e.g. , a few to several minutes ) because this pattern data were used to obtain better astrometry and photometry in the whole cosmos field ( aussel et al .",
    "2006 ; capak et al .",
    "2006a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "pattern c was used with a longer unit integration time because this pattern was used to obtain deeper data efficiently .",
    "our suprime - cam observations of the cosmos field have been made during a period between 2004 january and 2005 march , consisting of three common - use observing programs .",
    "four nights were allocated within the university of hawaii observing time on the subaru telescope during a period between 2004 feb and 2004 march ; pi = n. scoville .",
    "a summary of the observational programs is given in table 3 .",
    "it is noted that the two programs , s03b-239 and s04b-142 , were allocated as an open use intensive program ; such intensive programs provide the opportunity for researchers to proceed with large programs of advanced study that can only be achieved with the unique capability of subaru telescope and its instruments and needs an allocation of significant telescope time . another intensive program ( cosmos-21 )",
    "was also accepted in the semester s05b ( s05b-013 ) ; note that ` 21 \" means 21 filters in the optical window .",
    "however , details of observations of s05b-013 will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "including the university of hawaii time , 24.5 nights were allocated in total for our suprime - cam imaging of the cosmos field .",
    "these observations were carried out in eight observing runs ; see table 4 . during these runs",
    ", we obtained optical images of the cosmos field with the johnson broad band filters , @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the sdss broad band filters , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , and a narrowband filter , @xmath6 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 in capak et al .",
    "( 2006a ) to distinguish from the original sdss filters .",
    "also , our @xmath0 and @xmath2 filters are designated as @xmath43 and @xmath44 in capak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) where @xmath45 means johnson and cusins filter system used in landolt ( 1992 ) . ] .",
    "the filter response curves including the ccd sensitivity and the atmospheric transmission are shown in figure 3 .",
    "all the individual ccd data were reduced using imcat by the standard process ; bias subtraction , flat fielding , combining the frames , astrometry , and photometry . here",
    "we note that the night sky subtraction needs two steps to account for fringing and scattered light .",
    "the scattered light also makes it difficult to carry out accurate flat fielding .",
    "however , our careful experiments show that the central 26@xmath46 area of the field of view is stable at flat to 1% although the scattered light pattern shows variations as large as a few % outside the central 26@xmath46 area .",
    "details of these reduction procedure are described in capak et al .",
    "( 2006a ) and aussel et al .",
    "the psf sizes of final images are summarized in table 5 .",
    "note that the psf size of the images used for generating the official catalogue was matched to that for the image with worst seeing ( 16 ) .    in figure 4",
    ", we show the composite color image of the whole cosmos field made from @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 data .",
    "the reduced images were divided into tiles with a dimension of @xmath47 as shown in figure 5 .",
    "note that the center position of the cosmos field is located in the # 65 tile .",
    "the region colored in light - blue covered by 81 ( 9@xmath329 ) tiles is the cosmos hst / acs field .",
    "we estimate the limiting magnitudes by using the 81 tiles . for each tile , we performed aperture photometry for 10000 random points ( 810000 points in total ) on the psf matched image ( 16 ) with @xmath48 diameter and @xmath36 diameter .",
    "then we evaluated the limiting magnitudes from the standard deviation for the distribution of the random photometry .",
    "the results are summarized in table 5 . as shown in table 5 ,",
    "the 3@xmath49 limiting magnitudes are deeper than 27 mag .",
    "( @xmath48 aperture ) in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "however , in @xmath5 band , the limiting magnitude reaches to 25.7 mag .",
    "difference of the limiting magnitudes among the 81 tiles is less than 0.25 mag in each band ( figures  612 ) .        in figures 20 and 21",
    "we show the number counts of detected objects against the magnitude measured with @xmath48 aperture and @xmath36 aperture for each band , respectively . in this analysis",
    ", we use sextractor version 2.3.2 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) with the detection criteria of 5-pix connection above the 2@xmath49 significance and measured aperture magnitude for the detected objects .",
    "the sextractor parameter setup file used in our analysis is given in table 6 . apparently , the source detection comes to be incomplete at a shallower magnitude than the limiting magnitude .",
    "this may be interpreted as a result of flux lost from extended sources .",
    "note that breaks or drops of the number counts in the bright part are due to saturated objects .    in order to estimate detection completeness ,",
    "we have performed a simulation using the iraf artdata .",
    "we assume that galaxies have two types of light distributions obeying the exponential law and the de vaucouleurs @xmath50 law . for each type of galaxies",
    ", we generated 200 model galaxies for each total magnitude interval ( 0.2 mag ) in 9 tiles ( # 026 , # 029 , # 032 , # 062 , # 065 , # 068 , # 098 , # 101 , and # 104 in figure 5 ) .",
    "their sky positions , half - light radius ( 015 to 075 ) , ellipticities ( 0.3 to 1.0 ) , and position angles ( 0@xmath51 to 360@xmath51 ) are randomly determined .",
    "then these model galaxies are put into the ccd data together with poisson noises . after smoothing model - galaxy images to match to the seeing size",
    ", we try to detect them using sextractor with the same procedure as that used before .",
    "the detectability of the model galaxies in each band is shown in figures 2228 as a function of total magnitude and also summarized in table 7 .    in order to compare the input total magnitude of the model galaxies used in the completeness analysis with magnitudes obtained by aperture photometry , we measured the aperture magnitudes of them by sextractor .",
    "figures 2932 show the relation between the aperture magnitude ( @xmath48 diameter and @xmath36 diameter ) and the input total magnitude of model galaxies with the profiles of the exponential law and de vaucouleurs law .",
    "the measured aperture magnitudes are always offset toward fainter against the input total magnitudes .",
    "these offsets are smaller for @xmath36 aperture magnitudes .",
    "we present deep optical imaging observations made with the suprime - cam on the subaru telescope .",
    "our observations cover the seven filter bands from @xmath0 to @xmath5 .",
    "these imaging data allow us to investigate photometric properties of @xmath52 1 million galaxies found in the cosmos field together with the high - resolution acs @xmath53 imaging data .",
    "the major cosmos datasets including the subaru images and catalogs are publicly available ( following calibration and validation ) through the web site for ipac / irsa : + * http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu / data / cosmos/*.    the hst cosmos treasury program was supported through nasa grant hst - go-09822 .",
