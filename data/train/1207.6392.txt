    "the higgs boson mass in the standard model ( sm ) is not stable against qunatum corrections and its square has quadratic divergences . because the reduced planck scale is about 16 order larger than the electroweak ( ew ) scale , there exists huge fine - tuning around @xmath3 to obtain the ew - scale higgs boson mass .",
    "supersymmetry is a symmetry between the bosonic and fermionic states , and it naturally solves this problem due to the cancellations between the bosonic and fermionic quantum corrections . in minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm )",
    ", the gauge couplings for @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 gauge symmetries are unified at about @xmath7  gev  @xcite , which strongly suggests grand unified theories ( guts ) . unlike the sm , we can have the renormalizable superpotential terms that violate the baryon and lepton numbers , and then there may exist proton decay problem . to solve such problem , we usually introduce the @xmath0-parity under which the sm particles are even while the extra supersymmetric particles ( sparticles ) are odd .",
    "thus , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) like neutralino can be cold dark matter candidate  @xcite .    however , there are strong constrains on the supersymmetry viable parameter space from the recent lhc supersymmetry searches  @xcite . for example , in the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model or constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , gluino mass should be larger than about 1.4 tev and 850 gev for squark masses around and much larger than gluino mass , respectively .",
    "also , squarks ( at least the first two generation squarks ) must have masses larger than about 1.1 tev from the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "recently , the atlas and cms collaborations have announced the discovery of a higgs - like boson with mass around @xmath8  gev and @xmath9  gev , respectively  @xcite . in the @xmath10 final state ,",
    "the atlas and cms rates are roughly @xmath11 and @xmath12 times the sm prediction . in the @xmath13 channel ,",
    "the atlas and cms signals are roughly @xmath14 and @xmath15 times the sm prediction , respectively . in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels ,",
    "the atlas rates are respectively @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 times the sm prediction , and the cms rates are respectively @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "so these rates are somewhat suppressed compare to the sm prediction but error bars are relatively large . the higgs physics implications in the supersymmetric sms ( ssms ) have been studied extensively  @xcite . by the way , the new results from the cdf and d0 experiments  @xcite support the @xmath25 higgs signal and suggest an enhancement relative to the sm of the @xmath26+higgs with higgs@xmath27 rate by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "but we will consider not it here since it is different from the atlas and cms results .",
    "as we know , there are two higgs doublets @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the mssm that gives masses to the up - type quarks and down - type quarks / charged leptons , respectively . the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass , which is a linear combination of @xmath31 and @xmath32 and usually sm - like , is smaller than @xmath33 boson mass @xmath34 at tree level .",
    "thus , to realize the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass around 125.5 gev radiatively , the squark and/or gluino masses will be about a few tev in general in the msugra / cmssm .",
    "and then there exists at least less than one - percent fine - tuning .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to explain the above higgs decay rates and generate the correct higgs boson mass simultaneously in the mssm .",
    "for example , if the sm - like higgs particle has dominant component from @xmath31 , we can suppress the rates in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 final states , and then increase the @xmath10 rate .",
    "but the rates for the @xmath13 and @xmath18 channels will increase as well .",
    "also , if the stop is light , we can increase the higgs to two photon rate , but it is difficult to generate the 125.5  gev higgs boson mass  @xcite .",
    "the possible model might be the light stau scenario  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we shall consider the next to the mssm ( nmssm ) where an sm singlet field @xmath35 is introduced .",
    "the points are the following : ( 1 ) we can increase the higgs quartic coupling from the superpotential term @xmath36 if the ratio @xmath37 of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) for @xmath31 and @xmath32 is not large ; ( 2 ) we can suppress the couplings between the @xmath38 gauge bosons and the higgs particle due to the mixings among @xmath35 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , the strong cp problem is another big fine - tuning problem in the sm . from the experimental bound on the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) ,",
    "the strong cp phase @xmath39 is required to be smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "an elegant and popular solution to the strong cp problem is provided by the peccei ",
    "quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite , in which a global axial symmetry @xmath41 is introduced and broken spontaneously at some high energy scale .",
    "the axion @xmath42 is a pseudo - goldstone boson from the spontaneous @xmath41 symmetry breaking , with a decay constant @xmath43 .",
    "the original weinberg  wilczek axion  @xcite is excluded by experiment , in particular by the non - observation of the rare decay @xmath44",
    "there are two viable `` invisible '' axion models in which the experimental bounds can be evaded : the kim ",
    "shifman  vainshtein ",
    "zakharov ( ksvz ) axion model  @xcite and the dine  fischler  srednicki  zhitnitskii ( dfsz ) axion model  @xcite . from laboratory , astrophysics , and cosmological constraints ,",
    "the @xmath41 symmetry breaking scale @xmath43 is constrained to the range @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for such @xmath43 range , the invisible axion can be a good cold dark matter candidate with correct relic density  @xcite .    because axion can be the correct dark matter candidate , supersymmetry",
    "may only need to solve the gauge hiearchy problem and realize gauge coupling unification .",
    "therefore , we consider three kinds of the nmssm scenarios : in scenario i , @xmath0-parity is conserved and the lsp neutralino relic density is around the observed value ; in scenario ii , @xmath0-parity is conserved and the lsp neutralino relic density is smaller than the observed value ; in scenario iii , @xmath0-parity is violated and then the lsp neutralino is not stable . in particular ,",
    "scenario iii is very interesting since it can not only avoid the constraints from the lhc supersymmetry searches and xenon100 experiment  @xcite , but also may relax the other phenomenological constraints .",
    "moreover , the proton decay problem can be solved by requiring the baryon or lepton number conservation  @xcite , or by requiring the minimal flavour violation  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study the natural and realistic nmssm .",
    "we first briefly review the naturalness condition in the ssms and discuss the nmssm with and without @xmath0-parity . to satisfy the phenomenological constraints and fit the experimental data",
    ", we consider the @xmath1 analyses for all three kinds of scenarios , and find that we can indeed explain the higgs boson mass and decay rates very well .",
    "considering the small @xmath1 values and fine - tuning around 2 - 3.7% , we obtain the viable parameter space with light ( e.g.  less than around 900  gev ) supersymmetric particle spectra only in scenario i. for the small @xmath1 values and fine - tuning around 1 - 2% , we get the viable parameter space with relatively heavy ( e.g.  less than about 1.2 tev ) supersymmetric particle spectra . in particular , the best benchmark point has almost minimal @xmath1 and 3.7% fine - tuning in scenario iii .",
    "the generic features for the viable parameter space with smaller @xmath1 are that the light stop is around 500 gev or smaller , the singlino and higgsino are light chargino and neutralinos , the wino - like chargino is heavy , and the bino - like and wino - like neutralinos are the second heaviest neutralino and heaviest neutralinos , respectively .",
    "thus , we find that the lhc supersymmetry search constraints can be relaxed due to quite a few jets and/or leptons in the final states in scenarios i and ii , but the xenon100 experiment still gives strong constraint on the dark matter direct detection cross sections . moreover , the correct dark matter relic density can be realized in scenario i as well .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 is not large and the second lightest cp - even higgs particle is sm - like  @xcite , which is helpful to increase the sm - like higgs boson mass .",
    "however , the additional contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath2 are smaller than three sigma low bound  @xcite in general due to relatively small @xmath46 . as we know , with @xmath0-parity violation , we can escape the constraints from the lhc supersymmetry searches and xenon100 experiment , and the @xmath0-parity violation superpotential term(s ) may increase the muon @xmath2 and explain the neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "therefore , scenario iii with @xmath0-parity violation is more natural and realistic than scenarios i and ii .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we explain the naturalness criteria in the ssms in section ii .",
    "we present the nmssm with and without @xmath0-parity in section iii , and the experimental constraints / data and numerical analyses in section iv .",
    "section v is our conclusion .",
    "for the guts with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking , the usual quantitative measure @xmath47 for fine - tuning is the maximum of the logarithmic derivative of @xmath34 with respect to all the fundamental parameters @xmath48 at the gut scale  @xcite @xmath49 in the following numerical calculations , we will use this definition to calculate the fine - tuning .",
    "however , the above fine - tuning definition is a little bit abstract .",
    "thus , we shall present the concrete bounds on the @xmath50 term , third - generation squark masses and gluino mass in the following  @xcite .",
    "the sm higgs - like particle @xmath51 in the mssm is a linear combintation of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . to simplify the discussion on naturalness",
    ", we can reduce the higgs potential to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is negative . minimizing the higgs potential",
    ", we get the physical sm - like higgs boson mass @xmath54 @xmath55 so the fine - tuning measure can also be defined as  @xcite @xmath56    for a moderately large @xmath57 , for instance , @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 where @xmath50 is the supersymmetric bilinear mass between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the tree - level and radiative contributions to the soft supersymmetry - breaking mass squared for @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the following concrete bounds  @xcite :    * the upper bound on the @xmath50 term is @xmath62 thus , the @xmath50 term should be small than about 400 gev for @xmath63 fine - tuning .",
    "consequncely , the charged and neutral higgsinos will be light . in the nmssm",
    ", we just change the @xmath50 term to the effective @xmath50 term @xmath64 .",
    "* the one - loop radiative corrections to @xmath65 in the leading logarithmic approximation from the stop sector are @xmath66 where @xmath67 is top yukawa coupling , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are supersymmetry breaking soft masses for the third generation quark doublet and right - handed stop , @xmath70 is the top trilinear soft term , and @xmath71 is the effective supersymmetry breaking mediation scale .",
    "thus , one obtains @xmath72 where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are two stop mass eigenstates .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath76 . also , we can require that the lighter sbottom mass be smaller than @xmath77 , which is automatically satisfied via an simple mathematical proof .",
    "* the two - loop radiative corrections to @xmath65 in the leading logarithmic approximation from gluino are @xmath78 is the strong coupling , and @xmath79 is the gluino mass . here",
    ", the contributions from the mixed @xmath80 term , which are relevant for large a - term , are neglected .",
    "thus , the bound on gluino mass is @xmath81 so the gluino mass is lighter than about 1.8 tev .",
    "therefore , the natural mssm and nmssm should have relatively smaller ( effective ) @xmath50 term , stop masses as well as gluino mass . in this paper",
    ", we shall not only use eq .",
    "( [ bg - ft ] ) to calculate the numerical values of the fine - tuning , but also consider the following natural supersymmetry conditions :    * the @xmath50 term or effective @xmath50 term is smaller than 300 gev . * the squar root @xmath82 of the sum of the two stop mass squares is smaller than 1.2  tev .",
    "consequencely , we can show that the light sbottom mass is smaller than @xmath83 . *",
    "the gluino mass is lighter than 1.5 tev .",
    "however , such kind of the natural mssm and nmssm might be excluded by the lhc supersymmetry searches and xenon100 dark matter direct detection .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-parity violation might be needed for the natural mssm and nmssm , and then supersymmetry only needs to solve the fine - tuning problem and explain the gauge coupling unification .",
    "let us explain the convention first .",
    "we denote the quark doublets , right - handed up - type quarks , right - handed down - type quarks , lepton doublets , and right - handed leptons as @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "we denote the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 gauginos as @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , respectively . to solve the @xmath50 problem in the mssm",

    "in addition , from the theoretical point of view , we usually have the family universal squark and slepton soft masses in the string model building .",
    "therefore , as in the msugra / cmssm , we consider the following universal supersymmetry breaking soft terms @xmath105",

    "next , we consider the @xmath0-parity violation .",

    "( [ rpv-1 ] ) , the first three terms conserve the baryon number while violate the lepton number , and the last term conserves the lepton number while violates the baryon number .",
    "thus , to forbid the proton decay , we require either baryon number conservation or lepton number conservation , _ i.e. _ , we turn on either the first three terms or the last term in the above superpotential  @xcite .",
    "the alternative ways are to consider the minimal flavour violation  @xcite or discrete @xmath118 @xmath0-symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath119 and @xmath116 terms can contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath2 and generate the neutrino masse and mixings , and the @xmath116 and @xmath117 terms can contribute to the @xmath120 , etc  @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that the nmssm with @xmath0-parity violation has been studied before  @xcite , and the nmssm with baryon number conservation is similar to the @xmath121ssm  @xcite .    in this paper , to increase the sm - like higgs boson mass while keep the sparticle spectrum light , we will concentrate on the natural and realistic nmssm with the following properties : ( 1 ) @xmath46 is not large so that the sm - like higgs boson mass can be lifted via the tree - level @xmath36 term ;",

    "<S> from the current atlas and cms results on higgs boson mass and decay rates , the nmssm is obviously better than the mssm . to explain the fine - tuning problems such as gauge hiearchy problem and strong cp problem in the sm , we point out that supersymmetry does not need to provide a dark matter candidate , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath0-parity can be violated . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we consider three kinds of the nmssm scenarios : in scenarios i and ii @xmath0-parity is conserved and the lightest neutralino relic density is respectively around and smaller than the observed value , while in scenario iii @xmath0-parity is violated . </S>",
    "<S> to fit all the experimental data , we consider the @xmath1 analyses , and find that the higgs boson mass and decay rates can be explained very well in these scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> considering the small @xmath1 values and fine - tuning around 2 - 3.7% ( or 1 - 2% ) , we obtain the viable parameter space with light ( or relatively heavy ) supersymmetric particle spectra only in scenario iii ( or in scenarios i and ii ) . because the singlino , higgsinos , and light stop are relatively light in general , we can relax the lhc supersymmetry search constraints but the xenon100 experiment gives a strong constraint in scenarios i and ii . </S>",
    "<S> in all the viable parameter space , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath2 are generically small . with @xmath0-parity violation </S>",
    "<S> , we can increase @xmath2 , and avoid the contraints from the lhc supersymmetry searches and xenon100 experiment . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , scenario iii with @xmath0-parity violation is more natural and realistic than scenarios i and ii . </S>"
