    "the accretion tori around the stellar and massive black holes are the one of the interest to explain the observed high energies ( @xmath1- and @xmath2-rays ) in different astrophysical scenarios@xcite such as active galactic nuclei which may form during the collapse of super - massive stars @xcite , coalescing of the black hole and neutron star @xcite , etc .",
    "the analytic and numerical investigations of the oscillatory modes of accreated tori have been focused for a few decades .",
    "the oscillating relativistic tori in a strong relativistic region were numerically developed by @xcite and reference therein .",
    "the axisymmetric modes of high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hf qpos ) were investigated around the non - rotating and rotating black holes using a fixed spacetime matrix . in order to examine the disk oscillation under the influence of the radial perturbation and their nonlinear coupling with other modes ,",
    "@xcite studied the numerical simulations of the relativistic torus around the black hole implementing a pseudo potential .",

    "we have previously found @xcite the numerical study of the dynamical instability of the torus on the equatorial plane due to perturbation which was represented injecting gas from the outer boundary of the domain .",
    "it was shown that the mass accretion rate in the perturbed torus strongly depended on the cusp location and dynamical changes of the torus triggered the ppi .",
    "recently , the evolution of the perturbed torus implemented by adding the subsonic velocity to radial , vertical , and diagonal velocities of the torus had been carried out by @xcite .",
    "it was seen that the both @xmath1-ray and vertical epicyclic modes might be strongly excited in tori .",
    "the long term oscillatory behavior of the black hole torus system is known as runaway instability @xcite in case of axisymmetric perturbation but it is called ppi @xcite if we apply a nonaxisymmetric perturbation on the rotating torus around the black hole .",
    "it is seen in recent numerical simulations that eventhough the runaway instability does not have a significant impact on dynamic of the rotating torus @xcite , the nonaxisymmetric perturbations on the rotating torus may have a critical impact on the disk instability and in the variation of high energetic astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "based on the above insight , the aim of this paper is to extend the understanding of the dynamical instability of the relativistic torus in the case of the nonaxisymmetric perturbation of the angular velocity of the stable torus carried out by @xcite .",
    "all numerical simulations had been done by perturbing the torus which had a constant specific angular momentum rotating around the non - rotating black hole .    the ppi which created due to interactions of the propagation waves across the corotating radius is mostly explained by nonaxisymmetric perturbation of the torus around the black hole @xcite .",

    "the power spectrums of the observational data taken by various ground and space base detectors indicate the possibility of qpos from the various astrophysical phenomena .",
    "these qpos are the result of the consistent mechanism which is varying significantly with time .",
    "studying the qpos behavior of the tori around the black holes would help determine the physical properties of the black holes such as spin and mass @xcite .",
    "the frequencies numerically determined from oscillating tori around the black hole create certain ratios which may be used to identify the properties of black holes .",
    "for example , the ratio @xmath5 is suggested to be a resonance between the fundamental frequency ( orbital ) and its overtones in a strong gravitational region .    the paper is organized as follows : equations , models , and initial setups of the relativistic torus are given in section [ formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics ] . in section [ numerical results ] , the numerical results from our simulations are given and discussed in detail . the perturbations which produce qpos and ppi are revealed .",

    "it is also noted in fig.[casei_density_diff_time ] that as a consequence of increasing the angular velocity of the initial torus , the torus moves outward from the black hole and tightens more which causes an increase in the maximum density of initial stable torus .",
