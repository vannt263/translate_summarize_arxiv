    "the disordered two - dimensional systems are ubiquitous in the modern experiment , reflecting the current technological state of growing films . put simplistically , there are two dimensions to disorder : the strength and the frustration it induces in the system , both varying with the chemical composition .",
    "accordingly , there are several types of order at zero temperature : a homogeneous order , when the frustration is small , and an alternative order , the random glass state , frequently observed at low temperatures@xcite . in magnetic spin systems with a phase transition in a low - temperature ordered phase , like the ferromagnet , a weak disorder suppresses the phase transition temperature . in strongly disordered systems",
    "the phase transition in the spin glass state , that normally takes place at a finite freezing temperature , @xmath2 , can be suppressed by varying the chemical composition , as well as by decreasing the film thickness,@xcite all the way down to zero temperature . at low temperatures",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the spin glass are determined by its low - energy spectrum , described qualitatively by the picture of the droplet excitations . in particular",
    ", this spectrum determines the lower critical dimension . in this paper , for the two - dimensional gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice , we find the free energy and the specific heat in a wide range of temperatures and show , that the density of states vanishes at low energies , unlike the density of states in the spin glass .",
    "the random bond ising model , describing disordered spin systems , is the short - range version of the edwards - anderson model.@xcite usually , such models are divided into several classes , with continuous and discontinuous , as well as symmetric and asymmetric , distributions of the bond interactions . for a continuous symmetric disorder ,",
    "of which the gaussian distribution is a typical example , the random bond ising model develops no order in two dimensions,@xcite with @xmath2 equal to zero .    in the homogeneous spin systems , where the discrete symmetry [ @xmath3 for the ising system ] is breaking down spontaneously",
    ", the ground state [ the pair ] is unique , and all excitations have a finite energy , the gap .",
    "non - frustrating disorder induces tails of the density of states inside the gap . in two dimensions",
    "these excitations are the domain walls , encircling the connected area of the flipped spins .",
    "the longer the domain wall is , the more excitation energy it brings in .",
    "similarly , the ground state of the two - dimensional gaussian random bond ising model is probably also unique @xcite , whereas the low - energy excitations are droplets @xcite , representing connected clusters of flipped spins with fractal like boundaries .",
    "since the two dimensions lie below the lower critical dimension of the spin glass phase,@xcite the energy of the droplets , albeit distributed randomly , scales with the droplet size @xmath4 as @xmath5 , where the exponent @xmath6 has been found in multiple studies . @xcite",
    "the boundary of the droplet ( the domain wall ) treads a long fractal path before its total energy , locally positive and negative due to the frustration , will be fine - tuned into some positive value close to zero . from the thermodynamic point of view",
    "these droplet excitations represent two - level , flipped / non - flipped , states , presumably non - interacting .",
    "@xcite they determine the free energy and the specific heat at low temperatures .",
    "the extended low - energy excitations can be studied by methods of classical statistics , despite that at low temperatures the quantum fluctuations dominate on small scales . in the work  [ ] the density of states for a continuous and symmetric distribution of the bond interactions",
    "was found to be finite at zero energy and growing linearly with the excitation energy .",
    "accordingly , the specific heat was found to behave linearly , @xmath7 , at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the two - dimensional gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice at low temperatures . the usual method of choice for study such models",
    "is the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "however , the monte carlo method at low temperatures suffers markedly from slowing down.@xcite owing to a lack of the intervening phase transition from the paramagnetic phase in the spin - glass state , the high - temperature series , defined and valid in the paramagnetic phase at high temperatures , can be continued all the way down towards the zero temperature , provided a long enough series is known .",
    "the high - temperature continuation is convenient in that it gives a properly disorder - averaged observable directly in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we find the free energy and the specific heat .",
    "the specific heat vanishes at low temperature , in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics , and is found to follow the power law at low temperatures : @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "independently , we check this power law by directly counting all the many - body states of the gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice , confined onto small 6x6 samples .",
    "the @xmath10-law have been also observed in the experiments , @xcite though , the origin might be different and due to the spin - waves . interpreting this result in terms of independent two - level droplet states ,",
    "we find , that the density of states follows the power law , @xmath1 , at low energy @xmath11 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice is described and the graph expansion method is explained . in section iii",
    "the result for the average free energy and the specific heat are found , using the continuation of the high - temperature series as well as , independently , by studying small samples of the same model . in the approximation of independent two - level droplets",
    "the density of states is found at low energies .",
    "the two - dimensional gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice describes an anisotropic magnetic system , consisting of ising spins , characterized by binary value @xmath12 , assigned to each site @xmath13 on the square lattice .",
    "the two spins across the bond @xmath14 , a pair of the nearest - neighbor sites @xmath13 and @xmath15 , are coupled by an anisotropic exchange interaction .",
    "the total energy of this system reads @xmath16 the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath17 is a quenched random variable , which changes from one bond to another , and is distributed independently , randomly and symmetrically around zero : @xmath18=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } j}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{j^2_{\\mathbf{x}\\mathbf{y}}}{2j^2}\\right).\\ ] ] the average strength of the bond interaction can be normalized as : @xmath19 , without any loss of generality . the randomness of the bond interactions , eq.([distri ] ) , introduces a certain amount of frustration to the spin order , and the proper order parameter of this system is expected to be of the edwards - anderson type : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gibbs canonical statistics thermal average with the hamiltonian , eq.([rbi ] ) , at temperature @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the quenched disorder average with the distribution eq.([distri ] ) .",
    "however , for the two - dimensional random bond ising model with a continuous distribution of the bond interactions , like the gaussian distribution , there is no edwards - anderson order at any temperature , @xcite @xmath24 .",
    "this property is due to the presence of the soft modes , representing , for the ising systems , a flipped , with respect to the ground state , clusters of connected spins .",
    "also , some sites may be connected to the outside by couplings that all turn out to be small , or the `` effective '' field from the outside spins may turn out to be small too .",
    "this should be contrasted to the homogeneous ising model on the square lattice , where any excitation with respect to the ground state carries an energy , greater than the gap @xmath25 , and the specific heat follows the arrhenius activation law : @xmath26 , at low temperatures @xmath27 .",
    "we calculate the free energy of the gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice , eq.([rbi ] ) , using the continuation of the high - temperature series . in the work  [ ]",
    "the high - temperature series for this model was calculated , using the linked - cluster expansion method . in this method",
    "the thermal fluctuations , contributing to the free energy in the given order of the inverse temperature , @xmath28 , are sorted out by their footprint on the lattice , i.e. the minimal cluster in which a given fluctuation process may occur .",
    "it further turns out that many apparently different clusters give identical high - temperature series contributions , and therefore can be combined into broader classes , represented by a single graph , embeddable in the lattice .",
    "for that reason we will call this expansion a graph expansion .",
    "the main novel approach of this paper is to re - sum the high - temperature series before summing up the graphs .",
    "namely , for each given graph we aim to account for all possible fluctuations in all orders of @xmath28 , i.e. we try to find the accurate free energy for each graph in a wide interval of temperatures @xmath28 . in this way we order the thermal fluctuations by widening the footprints rather than by growing the perturbation order .",
    "the average free energy per one site of the square lattice is given by the graph expansion:@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 numerate the connected simple graphs , that are embeddable into the square lattice .",
    "@xmath31 is the number of the embedding of the graph @xmath32 into the square lattice .",
    "it comprises the degeneracy under the action of the point group @xmath33 of the square lattice on the embedding cluster and the degeneracy under the action of the bending parts of the embedding cluster .",
    "if @xmath34 is a subgraph of graph @xmath32 , then @xmath35 is the number of the embedding of the graph @xmath34 into any particular variant of the embedding of the graph @xmath32 into the square lattice .",
    "@xmath36 is the average free energy of the gaussian random bond ising model , limited to some embedding of the graph @xmath32 into the square lattice .",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are independent of a particular variant of the embedding .",
    "the cumulant of the graphs @xmath32 contribution to the free energy is defined recursively as:@xcite @xmath37 note , that eq.([exp ] ) follows from the above expression when @xmath32 covers a large part of the square lattice and , therefore , asymptotically @xmath38 .",
    "let us redefine , shifting by a constant , the bond energy of the ising model as : @xmath39 \\right ) .\\ ] ] we observe , that for any graph , that has at least one dangling edge , ending in a vertex of incidence valence one , the average cumulant of the free energy , evaluated using eq.([shift ] ) , is exactly zero .",
    "eliminating such dangling bonds one by one , we end up with a backbone graph , that consists of vertices of incidence valence two , three and four , all embeddable into the square lattice .",
    "graphs , that contribute the cumulants to the average free energy of the gaussian random bond ising model , eq.([exp ] ) , are conveniently classified , combined , into diagram classes , with the simplest diagrams schematically shown in fig.[diagram ] .",
    "these diagrams consist of vertices of incidence valence three and four connected by lines that represent vertices of incidence valence two and adjacent edges .",
    "obviously , the average free energy may depend only on the total length of the line , and not on its particular embedding route .",
    "we also observe , that a cumulant contribution from the graphs , that represent one - line reducible diagrams , also vanish . as well as the cumulant contribution from the graphs , that represent diagrams , that can be disconnected by cutting out a four - fold vertex , the so - called articulate graphs . finally , the sum in the graph expansion , eq.([exp ] ) , span only over graphs from the diagram classes , shown in fig.[diagram ] and the likes .",
    "any graph has a distinct property , namely the weight , defined as the number of the edges of this graph .",
    "we enumerate all backbone graphs without dangling edges up to the weight 14 and calculate their lattice degeneracy constants @xmath31 , as well as their sub - graph number table @xmath35 .",
    ", in units of @xmath40 , vs the inverse temperature , @xmath41 , for four sets of graphs with weights up to w=10,11,12,13 of red , green , blue and pink lines correspondingly .",
    "@xmath42 is fitted in the interval @xmath43 , the black line .",
    "( color online.),scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we study the low temperature phase of the gaussian random bond ising model , using a method of continuation of the high - temperature series , since there is no phase transition for the two - dimensional random bond ising model . summing up in eq.([exp ] )",
    "the contributions of all the graphs up to weight thirteen , falling into diagram classes like in fig.[diagram ] , we find the high - temperature series for the average free energy per site of the gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice : @xmath44 where the energy unit @xmath19 can be reinstated by dimension counting .",
    "this series is impractical to analyze at low temperatures as it is too short and irregular .",
    "instead we evaluate the free energies for all the graphs , that have weight less than thirteen , more precisely , namely up to the 127th order of the inverse temperature @xmath28 .",
    "this longer high - temperature series is re - summed , using the borel method , and then the pade approximation to the integrand . calculating the borel integral numerically gives us a useful approximation of the average free energy dependence on the inverse temperature . in the interval @xmath45 , thus calculated average free energy for any particular set of graphs turn out to be almost exact .",
    "we notice , that rearranging graphs by weight up to @xmath46 results in a partial sum of graphs : @xmath47 .",
    "the high - temperature series of @xmath47 in @xmath28 coincides with that of eq.([ser ] ) up to the power @xmath48 , and deviates in higher orders . at low temperatures , @xmath47",
    "start to increasingly overshoot in opposite directions , for odd and even weights @xmath46 .",
    "and we notice , that by attenuating the contribution of the subset of graphs of the largest weight @xmath46 by a factor @xmath49 results in the average free energy : @xmath50 , that continues to a somewhat lower temperature .",
    "we evaluate the average free energy , @xmath50 , for four sets of graphs of the maximum weight @xmath51 , all in the interval of the attenuation factor : @xmath52 . for each value of @xmath46 and @xmath49 an approximation of the free energy in the interval @xmath53",
    "is found , using the high - temperature series continuation up to the 127th order .",
    "it turns out to be already converged enough to be almost independent on the increasing of the maximum 127th order further .",
    "then , the attenuation factor is adjusted to give the free energy approximations , @xmath50 , to the lowest possible temperatures .",
    "we find @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the maximum weight , @xmath51 , correspondingly .",
    "the resulting approximations , @xmath50 , are shown in fig.[free ] .",
    "for odd weights , @xmath58 , there is apparently a high degree of convergence , whereas curves for even weights , @xmath59 , are less convergent .",
    "the anomaly of the curve @xmath60 is coming from one special `` window '' graph . for higher weights",
    "the contribution of one graph is smoothened by the others .",
    "we assume , that @xmath61 is the most accurate approximation of the true average free energy per site of the gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice in the interval @xmath62 .",
    "we fit @xmath42 in the interval @xmath63 , using the following extrapolation formula : @xmath64 it extrapolates between the ground state energy : @xmath65 , at zero temperature , and the high - temperature behaviour : @xmath66 , corresponding to a bunch of independent spins .",
    "we find , by best fitting 161 points of @xmath42 with the overall accuracy of 0.02% , that",
    "i ) @xmath67 , which is indeed close to @xmath68 , ii ) @xmath69 and iii ) the average ground state energy per site @xmath70 , in agreement with what has been found before.@xcite it is necessarily negative and somewhat higher in comparison with @xmath71 of the homogeneous ising model .",
    "this effect is due to the frustration and can be understood as follows .",
    "all bonds on the square lattice can be divided into two types , relaxed and frustrated ones , according to the value of @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the ground state configuration of the spins .",
    "we presume , that the frustrated bonds have relatively smaller interactions @xmath74 , whereas the relaxed bonds have relatively larger interactions @xmath74 in the ground state . also , @xmath75 is the exponent in the power law behavior of the specific heat : @xmath76 at low temperatures . approximately , the exponent @xmath75 is close to @xmath77 and the entropy @xmath78 is close to @xmath68 .",
    "vs the droplet energy in units @xmath40 , as found for the gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice ( red line ) , vanishing at zero energy , and the ansatz for a spin glass,@xcite which is finite at zero energy ( blue line ) .",
    "( color online),scaledwidth=43.0% ]    in statistical physics the free energy , eq.([freee ] ) , and the specific heat , eq.([result ] ) , at low temperatures are both related to [ i.e. can be derived from ] the many - body density of energy levels , that follows the law : @xmath79 for small positive @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the total ground state energy , @xmath82 is the total number of sites , @xmath83 is the proper normalization factor , @xmath84 is some characteristic energy scale of the order of @xmath40 , and @xmath85 in order to verify the validity of this relationship between the two exponents , we find all the many - body energy levels for a small cluster of size 6x6 of the two - dimensional gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and average relative energies , @xmath86 , for the @xmath87 lowest many - body excited states over 200 or so samples of the gaussian bond disorder . in this way we find the average many - body density of states , @xmath88 , and fit it with the ansatz , eq.([mbdos ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath89 , given by the best fit , turns out to be consistent with the exponent @xmath90 , while representing the independent low - energy approach to determine the density of states of the frustrated spin system .",
    "also , the free energy , eq.([freee ] ) , and the specific heat , eq.([result ] ) , can be derived on the microscopic level from the model of a non - interacting dilute system of two - level states , the droplets .",
    "an excited state in a system of ising spins is specified by a set of connected clusters of flipped spins with respect to the ground state .",
    "mutually disconnected clusters contribute independently to the total excitation energy .",
    "the excitation energy of a flipped cluster is positive , and is the energy of the domain wall boundary .",
    "the domain wall energy is the sum of the energies of the local bonds , positive and negative alike . with a small probability",
    ", we can find a specific fractal like loop with many negative bonds across it and , if the spins inside are overturned , the domain wall energy will be atypically small , although positive .",
    "such loops are rare in the space of random walks , but in real space are dense , and the two - level states are also dense , but presumably independent .",
    "the free energy of a system of independent two - level states reads @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the density of states . working out the relationship between the free energy , eq.([freee ] ) , and the two - level states model , eq.([twol ] ) , we find the low - energy asymptote for the density of the droplet states : @xmath93 approximately , @xmath1 at a small droplet energy @xmath11 .",
    "the density of states , eq.([dos ] ) , is shown in fig.[density ] , as well as the ansatz for the density of states of the spin glass.@xcite one can easily see why , provided an insufficient accuracy at low energy , or equivalently low temperature , the two relationships can be mistaken .",
    "the result , eq.([dos ] ) , shows clearly the difference between the gaussian random bond ising model on the square lattice and i ) the same model defined in one dimension , where the density of states @xmath94 at @xmath95 and ii ) other systems , that develop the spin glass phase at low temperatures .",
    "in conclusion , the average free energy and the specific heat has been found with high accuracy in a wide range of temperatures for the two - dimensional gaussian random bond model on the square lattice . at low temperatures",
    "both show a power law behaviour , with @xmath96 . we have found evidence , that the density of states of the low - energy droplet excitations vanishes at low energies , in remarkable contrast to the finite density of states in the spin glass phase and the finite density of states in the same model in one dimension .",
    "however , our method does not reveal the entire spectrum , or other properties of the low - energy droplet excitations .",
