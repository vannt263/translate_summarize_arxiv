    "the discovery of superconductivity at temperatures as high as 26 k in lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas @xcite , a layered compound devoid of cuo@xmath7 planes , has rekindled interest in high - temperature superconductivity . as for the cuprates @xcite , high pressure experiments can potentialy play an important role in furthering our understanding of the new fe - based pnictides @xcite .",

    "resistivity and magnetic susceptibility studies by several groups @xcite using various fluid pressure media agree that @xmath5 is positive initially , but differ widely on its magnitude . as in previous studies on the high-@xmath10 cuprates @xcite and the binary compound mgb@xmath7 @xcite , it would be of interest to carry out benchmark determinations of @xmath6 in magnetic susceptibility measurements on lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas using the most hydrostatic pressure medium known , he gas .",
    "one notable result is that the non - superconducting , undoped pnictides laofeas @xcite , cafe@xmath7as@xmath7 @xcite , srfe@xmath7as@xmath7 @xcite , and bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 @xcite reportedly become superconducting under pressure when pressure media such as fluorinert , methanol - ethanol , and silicone oil were used , superconductivity in cafe@xmath7as@xmath7 appearing at a relatively low pressure @xmath11 gpa .",

    "@xcite on cafe@xmath7as@xmath7 using he - gas pressure medium fail to detect any sign of superconductivity to 0.7 gpa and 2 k. these authors suggest that not only in cafe@xmath7as@xmath12 but also in srfe@xmath7as@xmath7 and bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 , non - hydrostatic stress components may have been responsible for the reported pressure - induced superconductivity .",
    "in addition , very recently matsubayashi _",

    "as evidenced by full shielding in the ac susceptibility , is only found in a rather narrow ( 2 gpa ) pressure region centered about 6 gpa , whereas non - bulk ( filamentary ) superconductivity is revealed in the resistivity which falls to zero over a much wider pressure region .",
    "the potentially important role shear stresses play in the superconductivity of the fe - based pnictides is emphasized in the recent review of chu and lorenz @xcite . indeed , shear - stress effects on @xmath6 are well known from studies on such diverse superconducting materials as organic metals @xcite , high-@xmath10 oxides @xcite , mgb@xmath7 @xcite , and re metal @xcite .    to our knowledge ,",

    ". it would be of obvious interest to extend such studies to the lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas system to ascertain whether @xmath6 differs from the findings of earlier studies where less hydrostatic pressure media were employed . using he as pressure medium brings a further benefit",
    ":  it allows one to change the hydrostatic pressure at relatively low temperatures , thus permitting studies of phenomena impacting superconductivity which are both pressure and temperature dependent .",
    "an example for such phenomena in the cuprates are the well known oxygen ordering effects which have been shown in some systems to be the dominant factor determining the dependence of @xmath10 on pressure @xcite .",
    "to throw some light on these issues , we have determined @xmath6 using he - gas pressure medium to 0.78 gpa for the original fe - based superconducting pnictide , lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas , where @xmath2 and 0.14 . for these doping levels",
    "we find the initial pressure derivative @xmath5 to be positive , but markedly less than the published values using other pressure media ; in addition , the dependence of @xmath10 on pressure is not reversible but depends on the detailed pressure / temperature history of the sample .",
    "possible origins for this behavior are discussed .",

    "ac susceptibility measurements at 0.1 oe rms and 1023 hz were carried out under pressure to the same high accuracy as measurements at ambient pressure by surrounding the sample with a primary / secondary compensated coil system connected to a stanford research sr830 digital lock - in amplifier via a sr554 transformer preamplifierthe .",
    "a two - stage closed - cycle refrigerator was used to cool the pressure cell to temperatures as low as 5 - 6 k ; measurements were carried out upon warming up slowly through the transition at the rate @xmath15 k / min .",
    "all susceptibility measurements were repeated at least once to verify that the reproducibility of the transition temperature was within 20 mk .",

    "we now compare the values of @xmath5 obtained from the present ac susceptibility measurements using hydrostatic he - gas pressure on lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 to those obtained in the above resistivity studies . in fig .",

    "the large magnitude of the superconducting transition is consistent with bulk superconductivity ; in fact , the shielding effect is approximately twice that expected for perfect diamagnetism .",

    "the superconducting transition is seen to shift monotonically to higher temperatures . here",
    "@xmath10 is defined by the transition midpoint ( see fig .",

    "@xmath10 is seen to increase under pressure at the rate + 1.20 k / gpa , clearly less than the value + 2 k / gpa inferred from the resistivity onset but greater than the value using the @xmath29 criterion at nearly the same f concentration ( @xmath24 ) @xcite ; in the resistivity studies the pressure was always changed at rt .",
    "the pressure was then successively reduced at low temperatures ( 62 k , 52 k , 45 k for points 2@xmath303 , 3@xmath304 , and 4@xmath305 , respectively ) before cooling down further to measure @xmath31 up to and including point 4 , the @xmath6 dependence is reversible ; however , at ambient pressure ( point 5 ) @xmath10 lies @xmath32 mk lower than the initial value at ambient pressure ( point 1 ) .",
    "interestingly , after warming the sample back to rt and holding for 1.5 h , @xmath10 is seen to revert ( point 6 ) back to its initial value .",
    "this behavior bears some resemblence to that observed previously from oxygen - ordering effects in the cuprates where @xmath6 may differ strongly whether the pressure is changed at rt or low temperatures @xcite ; there is , however , one notable difference - - when pressure is reduced at low temperature in a cuprate with oxygen ordering , all values of @xmath10 would differ , and not just those below a certain pressure threshold .    to examine",
    "whether , as in the cuprates , there exists a particular ( sub - rt ) temperature above which such @xmath10-relaxation occurs , we applied 0.66 gpa pressure at rt ( point 7 ) and then released pressure at 60 k ( point 8) , reproducing exactly the previous results .",

    ", @xmath10 would be expected to increase by approximately 8 k. in fig .",
    "2(a ) , however , the application of 0.66 gpa he - gas pressure at rt is seen to slightly broaden the transition in the ac susceptibility and shift it only slightly ( @xmath4 0.2 k ) to higher temperatures ( point 2 in fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , a shift 40@xmath26 less than the 8 k expected !",
    "this difference in @xmath5 decreases to 15 @xmath26 if the resistivity zero point is used ( 4.4 k / gpa ) .",
    "the sample was then allowed to remain at rt for various cumulatitive lengths of time ( 20 h for point 3 , 68 h for point 4 , 112 h for point 5 ) for a total of 112 h , during which time the pressure at rt decreased only slightly to 0.65 gpa ; surprisingly , @xmath10 is seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) to decrease by @xmath4 0.3 k ( point 5 ) ! releasing the pressure then at 55 k to 0 gpa  results in @xmath10 shifting further downwards to a temperature ( point 6 ) @xmath4 0.5 k less than its initial value at ambient pressure ( point 1 ) , the transition recovering its original sharpness .",
    "after the release of pressure at 55 k ( point 6 ) , holding the sample at 270 k for 1 h did not result in a further change in @xmath10 ( point 7 ) .",
    "the superconducting transition appears to be stuck at this lower value . such a feature was not observed in oxygen ordering phenomena in the cuprates @xcite .    a second sample from the same synthesis batch",

    "a pressure of 0.33 gpa was then applied at 60 k ( point 11@xmath40 ) and released again at 50 k ( point 12@xmath40 ) , yielding a value of @xmath10 approximately 0.8 k lower than the initial value ( point 1@xmath40 ) .",

    "in all previous high - pressure studies on the superconducting pnictides , pressure was changed at rt .",

    "to our knowledge , the only measurements of @xmath6 under pressure on lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas for fluorine concentrations near those ( @xmath2 and 0.14 ) used in the present study are the resistivity measurements to 1.5 gpa with fluorinert pressure medium by takahashi _",
    "@xcite for @xmath47 0.05 , 0.08 , 0.11 , and 0.14 . as discussed above ,",
    "if the pressure is changed at rt , the values obtained for @xmath5 from resistivity studies depend sensitively on the criterion used to determine @xmath10 ; the resistivity onset or @xmath29 point give @xmath21 2 or 0.54 k / gpa , respectively , in contrast to the present ac susceptibility studies using he - gas pressure where the intermediate value @xmath48 k / gpa is observed .",

    "the fact that the anomalous temperature / pressure effects are most dramatic for the @xmath13  sample , which lies near the substitution limit of f for o , suggests that the application of pressure may cause an irreversible phase separation .",
    "this would explain why the value of @xmath10 does not recover in our experiments after a pressure cycle , as seen in fig .",

    "et al_. @xcite using _ n_-pentane : iso - amyl alcohol pressure medium to 0.94 gpa .",
    "it appears , therefore , that in the 1111 fe - pnictides the pressure dependence of @xmath10 depends sensitively not only on the dopant concentration but also on which physical property is measured , how the value of @xmath10 is determined , and the type of pressure transmitting medium used .",

    "the marked temperature / pressure history effects seen in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 2(b ) may be indicative of important shear - stress effects between grains in polycrystalline samples , even when purely hydrostatic he - gas pressure is applied .",
    "parallel measurements on high quality single crystals would test this hypothesis .",
    "it is also possible that short - range diffusion of oxygen or flourine anions within the crystal structure may occur in response to a change in pressure at rt , much as the oxygen ordering effects  observed in the cuprate oxides @xcite .    in order to check whether the temperature / pressure history effects seen here might result from the penetration of the he pressure medium into the crystal lattice",
    ", we heated a 3.3 mg portion of the @xmath13 sample used in the present he - gas experiments to 100@xmath51c while connected to a sensitive mass spectrometer .",
    "we were unable to detect the slightest trace of he escaping from the sample .",
    "subsequent vaporization of this sample in an ultra - sensitive mass spectrometer set the he impurity level at @xmath4 1 ppm , an amount far too small to effect the dramatic changes observed in @xmath10 .",
    "an alternative scenario is conceivable .",
    "the undoped compound laofeas exhibits a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) and structural phase transition ( tetragonal@xmath30orthorhombic ) below 150 k @xcite . substituting o with f or applying pressure",
    "are believed to suppress this transition and allow a superconducting ground state to appear . a competition between a sdw instability and superconductivity is also observed in ceo@xmath0f@xmath1feas @xcite",
    ". perhaps shear - stress effects result in superconducting and nonsuperconducting sdw regions in the sample which lead to the complex temperature / pressure history effects found in the present studies .",
    "whatever the explanation for the anomalous behavior of @xmath6 , it is likely that in the oxypnictides , as in the cuprates , a full understanding of the manner in which @xmath10 changes under pressure may be difficult to obtain since it almost certainly depends on several factors simultaneously , including the strength of shear - stress effects as well as changes in the carrier concentration and the separation and area of the superconducting planes .",
    "further experimentation is clearly needed here which focusses both on pressure - induced changes in the superconductivity and crystal structure on global and local scales .",
