    "obviously @xmath5 is the average energy density .",
    "the quantity we are interested in is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the dimensionality of spacetime .",
    "more specifically , we shall analyze the inequality    [ eq : x ] @xmath8 ( it is not trivial because we are concerned , in particular , with negative @xmath0 ) under the condition @xmath9    in this expression the maximum is taken over all @xmath10 and all sets of indices .",
    "the hats over the indices mean that the components of the riemann tensor are found in the ( orthonormal ) frame associated with the observer .    in the next section",
    "i discuss the importance of inequality   in determining whether a spacetime is physically realizable . in section  [ sec : couex ] the massless scalar field is considered in the two - dimensional de sitter space . by explicit calculations",
    "the existence is demonstrated of a ` reasonable ' state @xmath1 such that is violated ( in this letter i regard a state @xmath1 as reasonable if @xmath11 is smooth over the whole spacetime ) .",
    "within the last decade dozens of papers ( see @xcite or @xcite for a review ) have been published on inequalities that look similar to and express the idea that  the more negative the energy density is in an interval , the shorter must be the duration of the interval \" @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all of them are often called equally  quantum inequalities ( qi ) , which leads sometimes to confusion and even mistakes .",
    "so , let us first establish terminology .    pick a non - negative function @xmath12 normalized by @xmath13 and",
    "consider the ` weighted average ' of the energy density @xmath14 ( both integrals are taken along @xmath3 , see the introduction ) .",
    "denote by @xmath15 the fock space built on a quantum state @xmath16 .",
    "then _ difference _ qis are the statements of the form @xmath17 following @xcite i shall call them _",
    "almost all quantum inequalities established so far are of type i. among them are , for example , those proved in @xcite or in @xcite ( in the former @xmath16 is the standard minkowski vacuum @xmath18 and in the latter it is the vacuum defined by the timelike killing field present in the spacetime ) .",
    "the second group is represented by the relation ( 4.1 ) of @xcite .",
    "the absolute qi have been derived so far only for massless fields in two dimensions @xcite@xcite , as is stated in  @xcite .",
    "the distinction between the difference and the absolute qis is _",
    "fundamental_. in particular , does not become even when @xmath19 , which happens in the minkowski space when @xmath20 , and perhaps may also occur in curved spacetimes for some special choice of @xmath16 .",
    "the reason is that the corresponding inequality holds not for the set of _ all _ ( reasonable ) @xmath1 , but only for a _ very special subset _ thereof ( recall that @xmath1 can always be transformed into @xmath21 by an appropriate bogolubov transformation ) .",
    "thus a phrase like ``  arbitrarily extended distributions of arbitrarily negative energy are not possible in minkowski spacetime '' @xcite to be a _",
    "correct _ inference from such a qi ( the inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1 ) ) in this case ) has to be complemented by quite a restrictive stipulation : `` if the field is in the state @xmath22 . ''",
    "* remark . *    the procedure proposed in @xcite ( the transition to the limit @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the length of @xmath25 ) transforms the inequality from into one looking _ similar _ to that from but not satisfying an essential condition @xmath26 . while the _ real _ does not follow from in this limit either",
    "the importance of the qis lies basically in the fact that they supposedly  place some severe constraints on wormhole and warp drive spacetime geometries \" @xcite .",
    "specifically , it was argued that the ` total negative energy ' needed to maintain a human - size alcubierre bubble or krasnikov tube is about @xmath27 g   and that the ` absurdly benign ' wormhole can exist only if the exotic matter supporting it is concentrated in a @xmath28 cm thick layer  @xcite .",
    "these estimates are obtained in assumption that for an appropriately chosen @xmath12 with @xmath29 @xmath30 in any spacetime for any ( free ) quantum field had infinite ` tails ' ) .",
    "this form it took a little later @xcite .",
    "there is also an additional requirement on @xmath31 , but[snoska ] in simply connected spacetimes without ` boundaries ' it is always satisfied . ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that is _ a conjecture_. being an absolute qi it , contrary to a common misconception ,",
    "_ neither follows from , nor is supported by any of multiple difference qis _ , as discussed above . at present",
    "it can be substantiated _ only _ by flanagan and vollick s qis for massless fields in two dimensions @xcite@xcite .    once the assumption is made the reasoning goes , roughly , as follows .",
    "consider a point @xmath32 through which there is a timelike geodesic segment @xmath33 of the length @xmath34 with @xmath0 negative and approximately constant along @xmath3 .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 ( @xmath32 satisfying all these requirements happens to exist in all three above - mentioned spacetimes ) .",
    "applying with @xmath36 to @xmath3 one can write @xmath37 or latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : pl_den }    @xmath32 must be planckian ! all the prohibitive values for the ` total amount of negative energy ' that are interpreted as severe restrictions on the warp drives stem just from this fact .    those restrictions _ by themselves _",
    "are , however , of little interest : both warp drives were designed to illustrate the idea of ` faster - than - light ' travel and to do that by as simple means as possible .",
    "it seems not improbable that it is just their simplicity that leads to the undesirable properties of the matter sources .",
    "that is why it would be important to find out to what spacetimes the foregoing reasoning can be generalized .",
    "a number of cases in which it does _ not _ work are already known @xcite . among them",
    "are    1 .",
    "the spacetimes in which the ` exotic matter ' is generated by _ interacting _ quantum fields , because _ is known _ to break down in this case , which is demonstrated with the casimir effect ; 2 .",
    "some wormholes , because the condition mentioned in the footnote  [ snoska ] does not hold there ; 3 .   the spacetimes in the relevant regions",
    "of which @xmath39 for all observers ( as , for example , in the vicinity of _ any _ gravitating body ) .    and yet , a lot of interesting spacetimes are conceivable that should be dismissed as ` unphysical ' be ( an analog of ) the restriction true .",
    "thus the quantum inequality deserves to be tested most seriously . in doing so ,",
    "however , one has to specify @xmath12 more definitely , because generally @xmath40 ( unless , of course , exotic matter is distributed homogeneously as in the example above , but no reasons are seen to restrict ourselves to this case ) . and",
    "it is quite possible that among qis obtained from by specifying @xmath12 some are true and some other are not .",
    "for example , one can choose @xmath12 to be the characteristic function of the interval @xmath41 : @xmath42 @xmath43 then is just @xmath44 and the inequality in transforms into .",
    "as well one could choose another @xmath12 : @xmath45 and get another inequality satisfying . ] .",
    "the state considered in the next section satisfies , ( in fully agreement with the results of @xcite ) and at the same time , as we shall see , violates .",
    "fortunately , one does not need to test _ all _ possible @xmath12 .",
    "the point is that the whole reasoning cited above fails when so does . to see this",
    "consider a situation in which breaks down , while with @xmath46 does not .",
    "that clearly would imply @xmath47 and , as a consequence , @xmath48 . the latter inequality combined with implies @xmath49 .",
    "so , instead of one gets @xmath50 quite a useless result !    to summarize",
    ", if the inequality held for all reasonable quantum states it would mean that a wide class of ` shortcuts ' @xcite require planck scale energy densities .",
    "in this implication can be substituted _ neither _ by a difference qi _ nor _ by the system , .",
    "that can be violated even in the minkowski space follows immediately from the results of @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding state would have singularities at @xmath51 . to construct a ` reasonable ' state violating",
    "consider the two - dimensional de sitter spacetime .",
    "one of the customary choices of coordinates casts the metric into the form @xmath52 however , to fix in a convenient way the quantum state of the field we shall use different coordinates . pick a function @xmath53 such that @xmath54{0.4pt}{1.4em } \\ , \\raisebox{-.55em}{$\\displaystyle{}_{(\\epsilon,\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\epsilon)}$ }   } = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln\\tan x,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a small positive constant .",
    "[ for example , @xmath53 can be defined as @xmath56\\,{\\mathrm{d}}s,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a partition of unity for the cover @xmath58 of ir , with @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . ]",
    "the new coordinates are defined as follows @xmath61 and the metric takes the form    [ eq : c ] @xmath62 where @xmath63 is smooth and nonzero in the whole space . in the region @xmath64 , see figure  [ fig : ris2 ] ,     the region @xmath64 ( dark gray ) of the de sitter space ( light gray ) in different coordinates.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    @xmath65 @xmath63 can be expressed explicitly : @xmath66{0.4pt}{1.4em } \\ , \\raisebox{-.55em}{$\\displaystyle{}_{w}$ }   } \\\\ = \\frac{4\\alpha^2\\cos^2\\nu\\cos^2\\mu } { \\sin^2(\\mu-\\nu)\\cdot e^{-2u}e^{-2v}}= \\alpha^2\\sinh^{-2}(u - v).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    consider now the massless scalar field in the conformal vacuum state associated with the metric .",
    "its renormalized stress - energy tensor in @xmath64 is readily found by formula ( 6.136 ) of @xcite : @xmath67 let @xmath68 be a geodesic segment@xmath69,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 are chosen so that @xmath71 for an observer whose world line is @xmath3 the energy density is as was erroneously written in the draft of this letter ) with which the term @xmath72 enters the expression .",
    "this coefficient , though , plays absolutely no role in what follows as we neglect the whole term [ on the strength of the condition ] . ]",
    "@xmath73 which yields @xmath74 at the same time @xmath75 thus , @xmath76 which obviously  just by picking sufficiently small @xmath55 and @xmath77  can be made arbitrarily large in contradiction with [ note that @xmath78 and so the criterion is satisfied ] .",
    "in a number of papers warp drives and wormholes have been labelled as unphysical because of the enormous energy densities supposedly needed for their existencem .",
    "so , deneb , say , with its radius @xmath79 m is characterized by the length scales with the ratio @xmath80 .",
    "the ratio of the mass scales is @xmath81 .",
    "is deneb unphysical ? ] .",
    "this idea is supported by the results obtained for the alcubierre bubble and krasnikov tube and based on the conjecture , .",
    "the generalization of these results , however , would require the validity of a slightly different inequality , namely , for all reasonable quantum states in reasonable spacetimes .",
    "in fact , however , the inequality turns out to be invalid even in a simplest case of the massless scalar field in the two dimensional de sitter space .",
    "consequently , there are no reasons any longer to expect that the shortcuts are necessarily connected with planckian energy densities .",
    "so , these objects are perhaps not that unphysical after all .",
