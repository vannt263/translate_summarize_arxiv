    "the motivation for this paper is the study of the modular representation theory of the symmetric group , and more generally the representation theory of the cyclotomic hecke algebra of type @xmath4 .",
    "this area has recently been revolutionised by the discovery by brundan and kleshchev of new presentations for these algebras , which show in particular that the algebras are non - trivially @xmath5-graded .",
    "the contribution in the present paper concerns the definition of the _ specht modules _ , which play a central role in the representation theory of cyclotomic hecke algebras .",
    "these modules have been studied within the graded setting by brundan , kleshchev and wang , and developed further by kleshchev , mathas and ram , who have given a presentation for each specht module with a single generator and a set of homogeneous relations .",
    "these relations include homogeneous analogues of the classical garnir relations for the symmetric group , which allow the specht module to be expressed as a quotient of a ` row permutation module ' .",
    "although the homogeneous garnir relations are in some sense simpler than their classical counterparts , their statement in @xcite is awkward in that the ` garnir elements ' involved are given as linear combinations of expressions in the standard generators @xmath6 for the row permutation module which are not always reduced .",
    "our main result concerning specht modules is an expression for each garnir relation as a linear combination of reduced expressions ; this simplifies calculations with specht modules , both theoretically and computationally .",
    "but this result is a by - product of the main work in this paper , which is to consider tilings of skew young diagrams by dyck tiles .",
    "these tilings were introduced by kenyon and wilson , who defined in particular the notion of a _ cover - inclusive dyck tiling_. they used these tilings to give a formula for the inverse of a certain matrix @xmath7 arising in the study of double - dimer models .",
    "we re - interpret the entries of @xmath7 in terms of what we call _ cover - expansive dyck tilings _ , and then , by proving recurrence relations for the numbers of cover - inclusive and cover - expansive dyck tilings , we show that ( sign - modified versions of ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 are in fact change - of - basis matrices for two natural bases for a certain permutation representation of the symmetric group .",
    "the fact that the two change - of - basis matrices are obviously mutually inverse provides a new proof of kenyon and wilson s result . along the way we give a result showing several different equivalent conditions to the cover - inclusive condition .    in order to derive our result on garnir relations",
    ", we then express the sum of the elements of one of our two bases in terms of the other ; this involves defining a certain function @xmath9 on partitions , and proving a similar recurrence to the recurrence for cover - inclusive dyck tilings .",
    "combining this with our results on change - of - basis matrices means that @xmath10 equals the sum over all partitions @xmath11 of the number of cover - inclusive dyck tilings of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , this had already been shown by kim , and then by kim , mszros , panova and wilson , verifying a conjecture of kenyon and wilson . as well as providing a new proof of this result ,",
    "our results working directly with the function @xmath9 allow us to derive our application to garnir relations without using dyck tilings .",
    "we now describe the structure of this paper .",
    "[ defnsec ] is devoted to definitions . in [ cidtsec ]",
    "we study cover - inclusive dyck tilings , giving equivalent conditions for cover - inclusiveness and then proving several bijective results which allow us to deduce recurrences for the number @xmath12 of cover - inclusive dyck tilings of @xmath3 . in [ cedtsec ]",
    "we prove similar , though considerably simpler , recurrences for cover - expansive dyck tilings . in [ ypmsec ]",
    "we recall the young permutation module @xmath13 for the symmetric group ; we define our two bases for this module , and use dyck tilings to describe the change - of - basis matrices .",
    "we then introduce the function @xmath9 and use it to express the sum of the elements of the first basis in terms of the second , before summarising the relationship between our work and that of kenyon , kim , mszros , panova and wilson . finally in [ klrsec ] we give the motivating application of this work , introducing the specht modules in the modern setting , and using our earlier results to give a new expression for the homogeneous garnir relations .",
    "the author is greatly indebted to david speyer and philippe nadeau for comments on the online forum mathoverflow which inspired the author to introduce dyck tilings into this paper .",
    "as usual , a _ partition _ is a weakly decreasing sequence @xmath14 of non - negative integers with finite sum .",
    "we write this sum as @xmath15 , and say that @xmath0 is a partition of @xmath15 .",
    "when writing partitions , we may group equal parts together with a superscript , and omit trailing zeroes , and we write the partition @xmath16 as @xmath17 .",
    "the _ young diagram _ of a partition @xmath0 is the set @xmath18 we may abuse notation by identifying @xmath0 with its young diagram ; for example , we may write @xmath2 to mean that @xmath19 for all @xmath20 . if @xmath2 , then the _ skew young diagram _ @xmath3 is simply the set difference between the young diagrams for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we draw ( skew ) young diagrams as arrays of boxes in the plane , and except in the final section of this paper we use the _ russian convention _ , where @xmath21 increases from south - east to north - west , and @xmath22 increases from south - west to north - east .",
    "for example , the young diagram of @xmath23 is as follows .",

    "the _ height _ of the node @xmath28 is @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30th _ column _ of @xmath27 is the set of all nodes @xmath28 for which @xmath31 .",
    "we use compass directions to label the neighbours of a node ; for example , if @xmath32 is a node , then we write @xmath33 and refer to this as the _ sw neighbour _ of @xmath32 ; we also write @xmath34 , and similarly for the other compass directions .",
    "a node @xmath32 of @xmath0 is _ removable _ if it can be removed from @xmath0 to leave the young diagram of a partition ( i.e.  if neither nor is a node of @xmath0 ) , while a node @xmath32 not in @xmath0 is an _ addable node of @xmath0 _ if it can be added to @xmath0 to leave the young diagram of a partition .",
    "we define a _ tile _ to be a finite non - empty set @xmath35 of nodes that can be ordered @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for each @xmath38 .",
    "we say that @xmath35 _ starts _ at its leftmost node , which we denote t , and",
    "_ ends _ at its rightmost , which we denote t. the _ height _ t of @xmath35 is defined to be @xmath39 , and we say that @xmath35 is a _ dyck tile _ if this maximum is achieved at the start and end nodes of @xmath35 , i.e.  @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath35 is _ big _ if it contains more than one node , and is a _",
    "singleton _ otherwise .",
    "the _ depth _ of a node @xmath41 is @xmath42    now suppose @xmath0 and @xmath1 are partitions with @xmath2 .",
    "a _ dyck tiling _ of @xmath3 is a partition of @xmath3 into dyck tiles .",
    "given a dyck tiling @xmath43 of @xmath3 and a node @xmath44 , we write for the tile containing @xmath32 .",
    "we say that @xmath32 is _ attached to _ if @xmath32 and lie in the same tile in @xmath43 , and similarly for , and .",
    "if @xmath35 is a tile in @xmath43 , the _ ne neighbour of @xmath35 _ is the tile starting at @xmath45 , if there is one , while the sw neighbour of @xmath35 is the tile ending at @xmath46 , if there is one .",
    "se and nw neighbours of tiles are defined similarly .",
    "now we recast the main definition from @xcite .",
    "say that a dyck tiling @xmath43 of @xmath3 is _ left - cover - inclusive _",
    "if whenever @xmath47 and @xmath48 are nodes of @xmath3 , @xmath49 lies weakly to the left of @xmath50 .",
