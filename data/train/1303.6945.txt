    "currently , observational cosmology has revealed that our universe is in an accelerating phase .",
    "it has been verified by the data of type - ia supernova and a large - scale structure [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "further , the anisotropic behavior of radiations in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as predicted by wmap [ 5 - 7 ] favor the accelerating expansion of universe . the exotic energy with negative pressure , known as _ dark energy _ ( de ) , is responsible for accelerating behavior of the universe . despite several observational facts ,",
    "the nature of de is still an open issue in physics .",
    "it is well - known that when phantom energy from an external source accretes onto bh , then mass of bh decreases such that it eventually attains extremal state and finally converts to ns . during accretion process , charge and angular momentum",
    "remain unchanged .",
    "in newtonian theory , the problem of accretion of matter onto the compact object was formulated by bondi [ 8 ] .",
    "michel [ 9 ] derived the relativistic formula for the accretion of perfect fluid onto the schwarzschild bh .",
    "babichev et al .",
    "[ 10 ] investigated that phantom accretion onto a bh that can decrease its the mass if the back reaction effects of accreting phantom fluid on geometry of bh are neglected .",
    "jamil et al . [ 11 ] discussed the critical accretion on the rn bh .",
    "they determined the mass to charge ratio beyond which a bh can be converted into a ns .",
    "the same conclusion was drawn by babichev et al .",
    "[ 12 ] , by using the linear eos and chaplygin gas eos for rn bh .",
    "madrid and gonzalez [ 13 ] showed that accreting phantom energy onto kerr bh can convert it into a ns .",
    "sharif and abbas [ 14 - 16 ] discussed the phantom energy accretion onto a class of bhs and found that cch is valid for phantom accretion onto a stringy charged bh .    motivated by the recent development in horava - lifshitz gravity , we investigate the phantom accretion onto a static kehagias - sfetsos ( ks ) bh in ho@xmath0ava lifshitz ( hl ) gravity , by using babichev - dokuchaev - eroshenko method [ 17 ] and discuss the locations of the critical points of accretion .",
    "further , the relations between critical points and horizons have been found .",
    "the gravitational units are used .",
    "all the latin and greek indices vary from 0 to 3 , otherwise it will be stated .",
    "the ks bh solution [ 17 ] is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants ) , for @xmath6 , ks bh @xmath7 schwarzschild bh .",
    "the horizons of ks bh can be obtained by solving @xmath8 , for @xmath9 .",
    "hence , in this case horizons are given by @xmath10    the energy momentum tensor representing phantom energy in perfect fluid given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are energy density and pressure of phantom energy and @xmath14 is the velocity four - vector of fluid flow .",
    "we note that @xmath15 satisfies the normalization condition , that is @xmath16 .    for the phantom energy accretion onto a ks bh , we shall drive two equations of motions , one by the conservation of energy - momentum tensor and other by projecting the energy - momentum conservation law on the four - velocity .",
    "the energy conservation equation @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an integration constant and @xmath20 for the inward phantom flow .",
    "further , the energy flux equation can be derived by projecting the energy - momentum conservation law on the four - velocity , that is , @xmath21=0 for which eq.([7 ] ) leads to @xmath22=-b_1,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is another integration constant which is related to the energy flux . also , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are densities of the phantom energy at finite and infinite @xmath9 . from eqs.([8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath26=b_2,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 .",
    "the rate of change of bh mass due to phantom accretion is given by [ 12 ] @xmath28 using eqs.([9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) in the above equation yields @xmath29 we note that the mass of bh decreases if @xmath30 .",
    "thus the accretion of phantom energy onto a bh decreases the mass of bh .",
    "it can be noted here that one can solve eq.([12 ] ) for @xmath31 by using eos @xmath32 . since all @xmath13 and @xmath12 , violating dominant energy condition , must satisfy this equation , hence it holds in general , that is @xmath33 .",
    "now , we analyze the critical points ( such points at which flow speed is equal to the speed of sound ) during the accretion of phantom energy .",
    "the phantom energy falls onto bh with increasing velocity along the particle trajectories .",
    "the conservation of mass flux is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the constant of integration . dividing and squaring eqs.([8 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a positive constant . differentiating eqs.([13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) and eliminating @xmath38 , we derive @xmath39+\\frac{du}{u } \\left[v^2-\\frac{u^2}{a(r)+u^2}\\right]=0.\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the lapse function as defined after eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "this equation shows that turn - around points ( critical points ) are located where both the square brackets vanish .",
    "thus @xmath42 solving above equations for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we can obtain @xmath45 we can note that in the limit @xmath6 , the above equations reduce to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , that is the schwarzschild hb case [ 9 ] .",
    "the physically acceptable solutions of eqs.([16a ] ) and ( [ 16b ] ) are obtained if @xmath48 and @xmath49 , implying that    @xmath50    it is not possible to determine analytically the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for which @xmath53 and @xmath54 , however we can obtain the positivity of these quantities graphically as shown in fig . *",
    "it is known that a bh surrounding the matter is expected to capture particles of a matter that passes near bh . in this paper",
    ", we have explored the phantom accretion onto a bh in hl gravity . by assuming that infalling fluid does not alter the generic properties of the bh , the equations of motion for steady state spherically symmetric phantom flow near bh",
    "have been derived .",
    "we herein discuss the accretion and critical accretion onto a bh by using babichev - dokuchaev - eroshenko method [ 10 ] .",
    "it has been found that like the cases of the schwarzschild and rn bhs , phantom accretion decreases the mass of bh in hl gravity .",
    "there exist two horizons for the hl bh , which depends on @xmath31 and @xmath55 .",
    "the critical accretion analysis implies that accreting fluid would attain speed of sound if @xmath56 .",
    "the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 plotted in fig . * 1 * , imply that for @xmath59 , the critical accretion is possible as @xmath60 .",
    "the location of critical point in case is @xmath61 .",
    "thus the location of inner and outer horizons ( eq.([2 ] ) ) for @xmath56 is given by table *",
    "1*.    from the fig .",
    "* 1 * and table * 1 * , we observe that for @xmath62 , the critical accretion points lie outside the inner and outer horizons . for @xmath63 ,",
    "the critical accretion pints lies inside the outer horizons but outside inner horizons .",
    "thus , we conclude that for each value of @xmath62 , there exist two circular horizons ( inner and outer ) that are bounded by a circle of larger radius , representing the critical accretion region .",
    "as @xmath31 becomes large @xmath64 the outer horizon lies into the critical accretion region ."
