    "intermittency is an apparently random alternation of a signal between a quiescent state and bursts of activity . in 1949 ,",
    "batchelor and townsend used the word intermittency to describe their observations of the patchiness of the fluctuating velocity field in a fully turbulent fluid.@xcite many natural systems display intermittent behavior , for example , turbulent bursts in otherwise laminar fluid flows , sunspot activity , and reversals of the geomagnetic field .",
    "well known models of intermittency include the three types introduced by pomeau and manneville,@xcite as well as crisis - induced intermittency.@xcite a different variety of intermittency was first reported when synchronized chaos in a coupled chaotic oscillator system undergoes the instability as the coupling constant is changed @xcite .",
    "this intermittency is now known as on - off intermittency .",
    "@xcite on - off intermittency appears in nonlinear dynamical systems with invariant subspaces , where the dynamics restricted to the invariant subspace is chaotic and the system is close to a threshold of transverse stability of the subspace .",
    "the main difference of on - off intermittency from other types is in the mechanism of the origin : on - off intermittency relies on the time - dependent forcing of a bifurcation parameter through a bifurcation point ; in pomeau - manneville intermittency and crisis - induced intermittency the parameters are static .",
    "it is known that the on - off intermittency exhibits characteristic statistics : @xcite ( i ) the probability density function ( pdf ) of the magnitude of deviation @xmath4 from the invariant subspace obeys the asymptotic power - law , @xmath5 , with a small positive exponent @xmath6 , ( ii ) the power spectral density ( psd ) of the time series @xmath7 in a low - frequency region exhibits a power - law @xmath0 dependence , and ( iii ) given an appropriately small threshold @xmath8 , the pdf of the laminar duration @xmath9 takes an asymptotic form @xmath10 in a certain wide range of @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite since on - off intermittency generates signals having @xmath11 psd with @xmath12 , the question arises whether a mechanism of intermittency , similar to the on - off intermittency , can yield signals having other values of the exponent @xmath13 of psd , in particular @xmath14 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate this question .",
    "signals having the psd at low frequencies @xmath15 of the form @xmath16 with @xmath13 close to @xmath17 are commonly referred to as `` @xmath2 noise '' , `` @xmath2 fluctuations '' , or `` flicker noise .",
    "'' power - law distributions of spectra of signals with @xmath18 , as well as scaling behavior in general , are ubiquitous in physics and in many other fields , including natural phenomena , human activities , traffics in computer networks and financial markets .",
    "@xcite many models and theories of @xmath2 noise are not universal because of the assumptions specific to the problem under consideration .",
    "recently , the nonlinear stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) generating signals with @xmath2 noise were obtained in refs .",
    "( see also recent papers @xcite ) , starting from the point process model of @xmath2 noise .",
    "@xcite yet another model of @xmath2 noise involves a class of maps generating intermittent signals .",
    "it is possible to generate power - laws and @xmath2-noise from simple iterative maps by fine - tuning the parameters of the system at the edge of chaos @xcite where the sensitivity to initial conditions of the logistic map is a lot milder than in the chaotic regime : the lyapunov exponent is zero and the sensitivity to changes in initial conditions follows a power - law . @xcite",
    "manneville @xcite first showed that , tuned exactly , an iterative function can produce interesting behavior , power - laws and @xmath2 psd .",
    "this mechanism for @xmath2 noise only works for type - ii and type - iii pomeau - manneville intermittency .",
    "@xcite intermittency as a mechanism of @xmath2 noise continues to attract attention .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we consider a mechanism of intermittency , similar to the on - off intermittency , occurring in nonlinear dynamical systems with invariant subspace .",
    "in contrast to the on - off intermittency , we consider the case where the transverse lyapunov exponent is zero . in recent years",
    "there is a growing interest in dynamical systems which are characterized by zero lyapunov exponents , namely , which trajectories diverge nonexponentially .",
    "@xcite chaos in such dynamical systems is called weak chaos . by relating nonlinear dynamics with the @xmath2 noise model based on the nonlinear sdes",
    "we show that for such nonlinear dynamical systems the power spectral density of the deviation from the invariant subspace can have @xmath1 form , i.e. , @xmath2 noise in a wide range of frequencies .",
    "thus a generalization of the on - off intermittency yields a new mechanism of @xmath3 noise with the asymptotically power - law pdf , originated from the commonly known phenomenon of the intermittency and weak chaos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we propose a model of intermittency with zero transverse lyapunov exponent and in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] we present some examples of nonlinear maps exhibiting @xmath2 noise . to obtain analytical expressions of the pdf and psd of the deviation from the invariant subspace , in sec .",
    "[ sec : map - sde ] we approximate discrete maps with sdes . section [ sec : concl ] summarizes our findings .",
    "we consider two - dimensional maps having a skew product structure : @xcite @xmath19 the function @xmath20 has the property @xmath21 and , thus , @xmath22 is the invariant subspace , while @xmath23 is the deviation form the invariant subspace .",
    "we assume that the dynamics @xmath24 in  ( [ eq : map0 ] ) restricted to the invariant subspace is chaotic . if the transverse lyapunov exponent @xmath25 along an orbit on the invariant subspace converges and is less than zero , then the invariant subspace is transversely stable with respect to this orbit .    in this article",
    "we consider the case when @xmath26 and , consequently , the transverse lyapunov exponent is zero .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the two terms with the lowest powers in the expansion of the function @xmath27 in the power series of @xmath23 have the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "this form satisfies the condition @xmath26 .",
    "particularly @xmath30 , however , generally @xmath6 may be fractional , as well",
    ".    we will consider the case where the function @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g - expansion ] ) is not constant and can acquire both positive and negative values .",
    "thus the expansion ( [ eq : g - expansion ] ) leads to the the map for small values of @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that when @xmath35 , the map ( [ eq : map1 ] ) becomes a multiplicative map @xmath36 , which is essentially the same as the map considered in ref .",
    "for modeling of on - off intermittency .",
    "the map ( [ eq : map1 ] ) is similar to pomeau - manneville map @xmath37 on the unit interval with one marginally unstable fixed point located at @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite the main difference from the map ( [ eq : map1 ] ) is that in the pomeau - manneville map ( [ eq : p - m ] ) the coefficient in the second term is static .",
    "let us consider the situation when @xmath38 . if @xmath39 then the map ( [ eq : map1 ] ) leads to the decrease of the deviation from the invariant subspace @xmath22 , whereas for @xmath40 the deviation @xmath23 grows .",
    "in contrast to systems with nonzero transverse lyapunov exponent , the growth or decrease of the deviation is not exponential .",
    "in fact , if the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : map1 ] ) is much smaller than the first and , consequently , eq .  ( [ eq : map1 ] ) can be approximately replaced by the differential equation @xmath41 , the growth or decrease of the deviation @xmath23 can be described by a @xmath42-exponential function with @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath42-exponential function , used in the framework of nonextensive statistical mechanics , @xcite is defined as @xmath44_{+}^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ , , \\label{eq : q - exp}\\ ] ] where @xmath45_{+}\\equiv\\max\\{x,0\\}$ ] .",
    "thus , although the lyapunov exponent is zero , the map can be characterized by a nonzero @xmath42-generalized lyapunov coefficient.@xcite    if the average of the variable @xmath46 is positive , @xmath47 , and there is a global mechanism of reinjection , the map ( [ eq : map1 ] ) leads to the intermittent behavior .",
    "as in on - off intermittency , the intermittent behavior appears due to the time - dependent forcing of a bifurcation parameter through a bifurcation point @xmath48 , thus the behavior described by map ( [ eq : map1 ] ) can be considered as a kind of on - off intermittency . however , on - off intermittency is usually investigated in dynamical systems with nonzero transverse lyapunov exponent .    for small durations of the laminar phase",
    ", one can approximate the map ( [ eq : map1 ] ) replacing @xmath49 in the second term on the right hand side with initial value @xmath50 . in this case",
    "( [ eq : map1 ] ) describes a random walk with drift .",
    "since the average displacement due to the diffusion grows as @xmath51 and the displacement due to drift term is proportional to @xmath52 , for small enough durations @xmath52 the diffusion is more important than the drift .",
    "it is known that for the unbiased random walk the distribution of the first return times has the power - law exponent @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite therefore , for small enough durations @xmath52 one can expect to observe the power - law form , @xmath54 , of the pdf of the laminar phase durations , the same as in on - off intermittency .",
    "the first two terms in the expansion ( [ eq : g - expansion ] ) do not allow to determine uniquely the pdf of the deviation @xmath23 . in order to determine pdf of @xmath23 and psd of the series @xmath55 , we need to take into account more terms in the expansion of the function @xmath27 in the power series of @xmath23 .",
    "one of the possibilities that we will consider is for the third term in the expansion to be equal to @xmath56 ( note , that @xmath57 when @xmath29 ) , leading to the map @xmath58 particularly , for @xmath30 , @xmath59 and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g - expansion ] ) and ( [ eq : map2 ] ) display simple taylor expansions .",
    "note , that a mechanism of reinjection operates at large values of @xmath23 and does not change eq .",
    "( [ eq : map2 ] ) , written for small values of @xmath23 close to the inveriant subspace .",
    "another example of the function @xmath27 having the expansion in the power series of @xmath23 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : map1 ] ) can be obtained according to the following consideration : in ref .",
    "a map of the form @xmath60 was considered as a model of on - off intermittency . in the log domain",
    "this map transforms to @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 . the critical condition for the onset of on - off intermittency is the condition for unbiased random walk , @xmath64 .",
    "one of the reasons for intermittent behavior is highly non - linear relation @xmath65 between @xmath66 and @xmath49",
    ". we can expect intermittent behavior also using other nonlinear functions instead of the exponential function .",
    "one of the generalizations of the exponential function , which corresponds to the differential equation @xmath67 , is the @xmath42-exponential function ( [ eq : q - exp ] ) obeying the equation @xmath68 .",
    "thus , instead of @xmath65 we will consider a relation @xmath69 , leading to a map of the form @xmath70 where the @xmath42-logarithm , defined as @xcite @xmath71 is a function inverse to @xmath42-exponential function .",
    "expanding the map ( [ eq : map - q - exp ] ) in power series of @xmath23 we get eq .",
    "( [ eq : map1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath42-exponential function @xmath72 tends to infinity as @xmath66 approaches @xmath73 and the variable @xmath74 can be introduced only when @xmath75 does not reach @xmath73 .",
    "this can be achieved by modifying the map ( [ eq : map - on - off - log ] ) for the values of @xmath66 close to @xmath73 in order to avoid reaching this value .",
