    "the remarkable progress in the field of ultracold atomic gases has provided access to a number of systems which may display quite new physical properties .",
    "one of the most striking example is provided by ultracold fermionic gases @xcite and the bec - bcs crossover . while the physics of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) is known from superfluid @xmath1he ( and from ultracold bosonic atomic gases ) , and the one of bcs condensates from superconductors , fermionic gases provide systems which display a smooth continuous evolution between these two extremes .",
    "this is made possible by the existence of feshbach resonances which allow to control the value of the scattering length @xmath2 merely by changing the applied magnetic field .",
    "for ultracold gases the kinetic energy of the atoms is so small that only s - wave scattering is relevant , and it is fully characterized by the scattering length . since pauli principle forbids s - wave scattering between identical atoms , the scattering length corresponds in most of the experiments performed so far to scattering between atoms in different hyperfine states of a same element .",
    "these hyperfine states are often called for convenience `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' . in the case of a wide feshbach resonance ( as it occurs for example for @xmath3li and @xmath4k ) , the closed channel responsible for the feshbach resonance may be omitted and the system is described by a single open channel hamiltonian , where the interaction is characterized by the single parameter @xmath2 . with the densities produced in experiments",
    "this interaction has quite a small range compared to the interatomic distance .",
    "this single channel hamiltonian is particularly interesting because it is at the same time very simple and highly non trivial , and moreover it is realized with an excellent precision in these ultracold fermionic gases .",
    "hence we may hope , in getting full control and understanding of this hamiltonian , to gain knowledge which may be applicable to more complex hamiltonians , such as those encountered in condensed matter physics or in quark matter @xcite .    in this context",
    "a simple general expression for the energy of a system described by this hamiltonian has been found by tan @xcite , which involves only the momentum distribution @xmath5 of the particles together with their large @xmath6 behaviour",
    ". however the details raise unanswered mathematical difficulties .",
    "nevertheless the expression can be checked in limiting cases ( see appendix [ a ] for details ) .",
    "this expression is of high interest since it is quite non trivial .",
    "it is directly related to the well - known problem that , for a contact interaction , the kinetic energy presents a formal divergence , because the momentum distribution @xmath5 behaves as @xmath0 for large momentum ( as found for example in the perturbative calculation of belyakov @xcite ) , a feature merely linked to two - body physics .",
    "naturally there is no divergence in the energy itself , because the interaction energy comes in to compensate this feature from the kinetic energy .",
    "this is easily seen from a simple finite range interaction model ( for example the square well potential ) , with range @xmath7 .",
    "the momentum distribution decreases more rapidly than @xmath0 , for momentum beyond @xmath8 which acts as a cut - off in momentum space .",
    "the apparently singular situation is found when one lets @xmath9 , which should be taken as the definition of the contact interaction . in the formula found by tan",
    ", the total energy appears essentially as the kinetic energy with this divergence problem removed .",
    "indeed the high momentum part , responsible for the divergence , is subtracted out and an additional explicit contribution which contains the scattering length appears .",
    "this matter has been taken up recently by braaten and platter @xcite who made use of the operator product expansion developped by k. g. wilson .",
    "they have in this way derived the energy relation in a compact and formal way .",
    "in contrast with tan approach the interaction comes in explicitly . they have also obtained the expression of the known @xcite adiabatic relation for this contact potential hamiltonian . this convenient expression in terms of the scattering length and of the coefficient of the @xmath0 tail in the momentum distribution has been pointed out by tan @xcite .",
    "quite recently it has been used @xcite to obtain the number of closed - channel molecules in the two - channel model . also very recently it has been derived and studied in details by zhang and leggett @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present first a derivation of this energy formula , which is simple , explicit , fairly short and avoids unnecessary and uncontrolled mathematical complications .",
    "it is in line with tan approach , in that it deals only with the kinetic energy .",
    "this is done in a careful way in order to avoid divergences .",
    "our treatment is similar in spirit to ref.@xcite .",
    "this simple proof allows straightforward generalizations to more complicated situations , with unequal masses , several kinds of particles and two - dimensional space .",
    "next we show how , in a field theoretical approach , the @xmath0 tail in the momentum distribution and the energy formula arise in a natural way . finally , as a specific example , we consider also quantitative calculations within the ladder diagrams approximation in the normal state .",
    "there are different ways to obtain the energy and we can compare the various approximate results , which gives an indication on the quality of the approximation .",
    "in this paragraph we consider the case where we have only two kinds of particles which are ultracold fermions .",
    "the volume of the system is assumed to be unity .",
    "namely we have @xmath10 particles with mass @xmath11 and @xmath12 particles with mass @xmath13 .",
    "we consider directly the case where the masses @xmath11 and @xmath13 are different since it does not make any problem .",
    "the positions of the @xmath14 particles are denoted @xmath15 , while those of the @xmath16 particles are @xmath17 . for these ultracold fermions only s - wave scattering",
    "has to be taken into account .",
    "hence only interactions between @xmath14 and @xmath16 particles have to be considered .",
    "generalizations are considered in the next section .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath18 with ( we take @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 and @xmath21 we assume the interaction potential @xmath22 to be short - range . for clarity and simplicity",
    "we assume that it has a definite range @xmath7 and satisfies @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "however , just as in standard scattering theory @xcite , the results will hold for physical short - range potentials where the interaction decreases rapidly enough with interparticle distance .",
    "we consider an eigenfunction @xmath25 of this hamiltonian , having for example in mind the ground state wavefunction .",
    "however this is not necessary and we can as well consider excited states , which leads to the extension of the results to non zero temperature , as pointed out by tan @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 be the corresponding wavefunction , with proper symmetrization and normalization to unity .",
    "we want to calculate the energy corresponding to this state : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is for @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we follow the basic principle put forward by tan @xcite . in eq.([en1 ] ) the potential @xmath22 comes in only in the regions of the integration domain where @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the overlap between these regions is negligible for dilute gases where @xmath7 is small compared with the mean interparticle distance @xmath35 .",
    "there are @xmath36 such regions .",
    "compared to the total integration domain , the domain of these regions is of order @xmath37 . for equal populations",
    "@xmath38 , this would be of order @xmath39 .",
    "since we have @xmath40 also inside these regions , and that @xmath41 inside these regions has no singular behaviour ( this can be checked explicitly since this behaviour is obtained from a one - body schrdinger equation , as we use below ) , we may neglect the contribution of these regions .",
    "actually this has to be done for consistency since @xcite keeping only s - wave scattering for ultracold gases implies that terms of order @xmath42 , corresponding to higher angular momenta , are neglected .",
    "hence the energy is simply obtained by calculating the kinetic energy outside these regions : @xmath43    we introduce now the fourier transform @xmath44 of @xmath45 with respect to all variables : @xmath46 where we use the notation @xmath47 .",
    "the one - particle density distributions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given by : @xmath50 this leads to : @xmath51\\,\\varphi(\\{{\\bf k}_i\\},\\{{\\bf q}_j\\ } ) \\int_{|{\\bf r}_m - \\boldsymbol{\\rho}_n|>r_0}\\;d{\\bf r}_i\\,d\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_j\\;e^{i \\sum_{i}({\\bf k}_i-{\\bf k}'_i).{\\bf r}_i +   i \\sum_{j}({\\bf q}_j-{\\bf q}'_j).\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we did not have the restrictions @xmath52 in the last integral , it would give a factor proportional to @xmath53 and we would find the standard expression for the kinetic energy : @xmath54 which displays a divergence for large wave vector . hence the restriction is crucial in order to avoid the divergence .",
    "however , since we want to have the standard expression for the kinetic energy appearing , we will write : @xmath55 where for simplicity we have not written explicitely the exponential integrand appearing in eq.([eqetf ] ) .",
    "as long as all the @xmath56 and @xmath57 integrations are not performed in eq.([eqetf ] ) , no singularity appears so we can handle the various terms in eq.([eqsep ] ) separately .",
    "as we have just mentionned the first one leads to the standard kinetic energy expression , so we have just to handle the other terms quite carefully since the limit @xmath9 is singular .",
    "note that , in the regions @xmath58 , we will deal with the analytic continuation of the expression of the wavefunction for @xmath52 which we will discuss below .",
    "this is naturally quite different from its physical value in these regions , since , for these last one , the interaction @xmath22 has to be taken into account .",
    "let us consider the term @xmath59 in eq.([eqsep ] ) . in eq.([eqetf ] ) only the terms @xmath60 in the bracket will be relevant , and for now on we consider only these ones .",
    "basically we will deal carefully with this two - body problem .",
    "accordingly it is convenient to think , as long as we are not back to the many - body problem , that only these two particles scatter .",
    "equivalently we could handle all the @xmath61 terms simultaneously , but this is much more cumbersome presentation . since they are more convenient to express the condition @xmath62 , we introduce the relative position @xmath63 and the center of mass position @xmath64 , together with their conjugate variables the total momentum @xmath65 and the relative momentum @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "we have : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the reduced mass .",
    "the difficulties arise from the @xmath70 term in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "it is convenient for the discussion to introduce the fourier transform @xmath71 of the wavefunction with respect to the variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 , instead of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is merely given by : @xmath76 making use , in eq.([eqetf ] ) and eq.([eqsep ] ) , of @xmath77 , together with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we find that , for the @xmath80 term in eq.([eqch ] ) , we have to deal with : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a short - hand for @xmath83 .",
    "we have used the fact that integration over all unrestricted position variables gives corresponding @xmath84 functions for the corresponding wavevector variables , as we have mentionned above . the problem for large @xmath6 in this expression",
    "is directly linked to the behaviour of the wavefunction for small relative distance @xmath85 , which we consider now .",
    "when the relative distance @xmath85 is small compared to the mean interparticle distance @xmath35 , the dependence of the wavefunction @xmath26 on @xmath72 is given by the solution of the relative motion of the two - body problem .",
    "for ultracold gases the energy corresponding to this motion is nearly zero and the corresponding wavefunction is , for @xmath24 , proportional to @xmath86 with @xmath87 where @xmath2 is the scattering length @xcite .",
    "this form is actually valid provided @xmath85 is small compared to a typical particle wavelength , that is @xmath88 . since we have @xmath89 , there is a range of validity for this form for @xmath24 .",
    "we are also interested in the case of large positive @xmath2 , where a two - body bound state exists with wavefunction proportional to @xmath90 . in this case the above form requires @xmath91 .",
    "there is again a range of validity for this condition for @xmath24 since we are in practice interested in physical situations where the scattering length @xmath2 is large compared to the potential range @xmath7 .",
    "hence for small @xmath85 we have : @xmath92    since in the evaluation of the @xmath93 term of eq.([eqsep ] ) , we will let @xmath9 , only large values of @xmath94 are relevant .",
    "indeed if we considered only bounded values @xmath95 , this term would go to zero for @xmath9 ( and the @xmath6 integral would converge because of the cut - off @xmath96 ) .",
    "hence we have to consider @xmath97 . in this case the dependence of @xmath71 on @xmath6 is entirely linked to the short distance behaviour on @xmath85 of @xmath26 given by eq.([eqptr ] ) .",
    "we have in this limit : @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the fourier transform of @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "as it is well known , the fourier transform of @xmath103 is @xmath104 . on the other hand , for the calculation of @xmath105 in expression ( [ eqkterm ] )",
    ", we do not have to take into account the constant @xmath106 in the wavefunction since it gives zero when we apply on it the kinetic energy operator @xmath107 ( corresponding to the factor @xmath108 ) .",
    "all this fourier transform calculation can be done quite carefully by multiplying the wavefunction @xmath101 by a convergence factor @xmath109 , then letting @xmath110 .",
    "this confirms the above results .",
    "finally , when handling expression ( [ eqkterm ] ) , we have merely @xmath111 .    physically",
    ": @xmath112 is the isotropic probability distribution of wavevector @xmath94 in the relative motion of the two @xmath14 and @xmath16 particles we are considering .",
    "we have found that its leading behaviour for @xmath97 is @xmath113 with : @xmath114    on the other hand , with respect to @xmath115 integration in expression ( [ eqkterm ] ) , it is more convenient to go back to @xmath72 space through @xmath116 , which gives a factor @xmath117 . since @xmath101 is isotropic , we can perform explicitely the angular @xmath72 integration @xmath118 .",
    "finally , for expression ( [ eqkterm ] ) , we are left with the calculation of @xmath119 . this @xmath85 integration",
    "is easily performed , leading to : @xmath120    we write now , with this result , the partial contribution @xmath121 to the energy eq.([eqetf ] ) , coming from the term @xmath59 in eq.([eqsep ] ) and where we retain only the @xmath80 term in eq.([eqch ] ) .",
    "we obtain : @xmath122 in the first term in the right - hand side , we have put a cut - off @xmath96 since this integral diverges when @xmath123 .",
    "this divergence will just compensate in the final result the above mentionned divergence in eq.([eqkinen ] ) .",
    "hence the global result will be convergent as expected .",
    "if in the last integral of eq.([eq11 ] ) we were setting @xmath124 , we would get @xmath125 and a divergent result .",
    "instead this integral is perfectly convergent when we calculate it explicitly for @xmath126 and then take properly the @xmath9 limit .",
    "indeed we see that it is not divergent because @xmath127 involves oscillatory functions .",
    "the @xmath128 term merely gives a result proportional to @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the dirac distribution . since @xmath126 the contribution of this @xmath128 term is zero . on the other hand , owing to : @xmath131 the @xmath132 term gives a contribution @xmath133 to the integral , leading to a contribution @xmath134 to @xmath121 .",
    "as we have mentionned above , we could improve the presentation of our handling of the @xmath6 integration , to deal with perfectly defined integrals , by introducing a convergence factor @xmath135 and then let @xmath136 .",
    "physically this would correspond to regularize the wavefunction in the @xmath137 limit .",
    "this would confirm our above results .",
    "we have not yet taken into account the @xmath138 term in eq.([eqch ] ) , because there is no singular behaviour associated with it . the corresponding contribution @xmath139 of the term @xmath59 in eq.([eqsep ] ) goes to zero as @xmath9 , as it is obvious directly and can be checked by following the same procedure as above .",
    "finally one sees easily that , for all the other kinetic energy terms @xmath140 in the bracket of eq.([eqetf ] ) , the contribution from the term @xmath59 in eq.([eqsep ] ) also goes to zero when @xmath9 .",
    "hence the total contribution @xmath141 of the @xmath59 term is merely @xmath142 .",
    "we rewrite now the sum @xmath141 in terms of the variables corresponding to particle @xmath14 and @xmath16 , instead of the relative and center of mass variables .",
    "we have : @xmath143 with again a cut - off @xmath96 understood for the summation over @xmath94 , and where we have introduced : @xmath144 related to @xmath145 by @xmath146 . with @xmath147 , we have : @xmath148 we make use of eq.([eqch ] ) to go back to the @xmath149 and @xmath150 variables .",
    "in the first term we change the summation variables from @xmath151 to @xmath152 , making use of @xmath153 .",
    "in particular we have @xmath154 .",
    "however we can use the identity : @xmath155=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 is any fixed vector ( this result is obvious by changing @xmath72 into @xmath157 ) , to write , @xmath158=0 $ ] at fixed @xmath159 . proceeding in the same way with the second term of eq.([eqe1 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath160 with a cut - off @xmath96 understood for the summation over @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "in conclusion we have calculated all the contributions coming from the presence of the term @xmath59 in eq.([eqsep ] ) .",
    "these are just the three terms , proportional to @xmath145 , in eq.([eqfin11 ] ) . to summarize , for the expression of the energy , we are back to eq.([eqetf ] ) with the restriction @xmath161 removed , and the above three @xmath145 terms added .",
    "we have just to repeat the same argument for all the other restrictions @xmath162 .",
    "in this way we obtain @xmath163 analogous @xmath145 terms , which are naturally all equivalent after a change of variables . taking eq.([eqkinen ] ) into account , this leads to the final expression for the energy : @xmath164 + \\frac{1}{2 m { _ { \\downarrow}}}\\sum_{{\\bf q}}\\left[q^2\\,n { _ { \\downarrow}}(q)-\\frac{n_4}{q^2}\\right ] + \\frac{n_4}{8\\pi \\mu a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 . indeed , from eq.([eqnup ] ) , @xmath48 and @xmath49 behave in this way for large @xmath6 since for example @xmath149 scatters with all the @xmath166 , and each scattering brings a contribution @xmath113 .",
    "that is any of the @xmath10 particles scatters with any of the @xmath12 particles .",
    "hence the summations in eq.([eqfin ] ) are perfectly convergent .",
    "this formula is the simple generalization of the formula found by tan @xcite to the case where the two species of involved particles have different masses .    in this derivation",
    "we introduced a cut - off to manipulate separately each contribution .",
    "this makes an easier presentation for the derivation .",
    "however this is just a convenience .",
    "we could avoid it by handling all the terms simultaneously .",
    "the presentation would be much awkward , but we would only deal with well defined convergent integrals , without any need for a cut - off .",
    "it is first worthwhile to note that the above derivation did not make use of the statistics of the particles .",
    "hence the result is valid for bosons as well as for fermions .",
    "naturally it is artificial for bosons to consider only scattering between different species , although it might just happen that this scattering is the dominant one .",
    "nevertheless for bosons there is no reason to exclude scattering between particles belonging to the same species .",
    "if we consider first the case of a single bosonic species , with @xmath167 particles of mass @xmath168 in the unit volume and with scattering length @xmath2 , we can follow the same procedure as in the preceding section .",
    "we can write the equivalent of eq.([eqetf ] ) for a single species , with a restriction @xmath169 working now between any of the @xmath170 couples of particles .",
    "taking care of the restrictions in the same way as in the preceding section , we end up with : @xmath171 + \\frac{n_4}{8\\pi m a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath172 .",
    "we can then generalize this result to any mixture of @xmath173 boson species with @xmath174 particles of mass @xmath175 in the unit volume ( @xmath176 ) and interaction between species @xmath177 and @xmath178 characterized by scattering lengths @xmath179 .",
    "we find in the same way : @xmath180 + \\frac{1}{16\\pi}\\sum_{i , j}\\frac{n_{4ij}}{\\mu_{ij } a_{ij}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath181 is the reduced mass for the @xmath182 scattering , @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "naturally the formula is more complex for these mixtures , since it requires the knowledge of the @xmath185 constants @xmath186 associated with the @xmath187 scattering .",
    "the same result works for ultracold fermionic mixtures , except that we have to set @xmath188 because of pauli principle .",
    "while in 1d situations the kinetic energy converges , and indeed in exact solutions of many - body problems the energy is precisely calculated by evaluating the kinetic energy , there is in 2d a divergence analogous to the 3d case , except that the divergence is logarithmic in the 2d case .",
    "we show here how the procedure followed in 3d can be extended to this 2d case .",
    "actually there is not so much difference since the space dimensionality does not appear in the principle of the procedure .",
    "the changes appear only when one comes to pratical matters .",
    "we keep the same notations for the variables , but naturally we have to deal now with two dimensional variables and integrations .",
    "first the expression of the wavefunction @xmath86 for the relative motion at small distance @xmath24 is modified into @xmath189 , which is solution of the 2d equation @xmath190 .",
    "the length @xmath2 for which @xmath191 plays the role of the scattering length and is naturally obtained from the interaction potential .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath86 is @xmath192 , omitting the irrelevant fourier transform of @xmath193 .",
    "similarly the large @xmath6 behaviour of @xmath194 is @xmath113 , with @xmath195 appearing in eq.([eqp4 ] ) instead of @xmath196 .",
    "then the 2d angular integration gives @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the first kind bessel function .",
    "hence , instead of eq.([eq11 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath199 where in the last expression we have changed to the variable @xmath200 , and we have naturally to take the cut - off @xmath123 at the end of the calculation , when the standard kinetic energy term is included , as we have done in section [ detder ] . the logarithmic divergence arising in this standard term",
    "is expected to be compensated by the contributions of all the terms similar to eq.([eq112d ] ) . indeed , integrating by parts",
    ", we have : @xmath201^{k_c}_{0}- r^2_0 \\int_{0}^{k_c}dk\\ , k\\,\\ln k \\ln(kr_0)\\ , j_0(kr_0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to evaluate the first term we use @xcite ( when the integral is not absolutely convergent , we define it as above with an exponential convergence factor , with an extremely weak decreasing behaviour ) : @xmath202 ( where @xmath203 is the standard euler gamma function ) together with @xmath204 . note in particular that @xmath205 .",
    "this gives @xmath206 , which is also consistent with the fact that the fourier transform of @xmath207 is @xmath208 .",
    "hence we find indeed that eq.([eqterma ] ) provides the required compensating term to avoid a divergent result .",
    "the other terms lead to constants , so we may take immediately in their expression the limit @xmath123 . first ,",
    "except for the prefactor @xmath209 , the factor of @xmath193 in the second term of the integral in eq.([eq112d ] ) is : @xmath210 by the change of variable @xmath211 and by integrating by parts .",
    "this means that the divergent contribution of the second term in eq.([eq112d ] ) is proportional to @xmath212 , as could be expected from dimensional analysis .    finally in eq.([eq112d ] ) we have still a contribution proportional to @xmath213 : @xmath214 again by integrating by parts .",
    "gathering this term and the second term in eq.([eqterma ] ) , we have : @xmath215 where , in the last step for the term proportional to @xmath216 , we have used again @xmath205 . the remaining integral",
    "is calculated again by making use of eq.([eqbessel ] ) and is found to be @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the euler constant . gathering the above results we obtain : @xmath219    finally , just as for the 3d case , we want to go back to the variables corresponding to particle @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "it may be seen that this does not lead to additional contributions .",
    "this leads us finally to : @xmath220 + \\frac{1}{2 m { _ { \\downarrow}}}\\lim _ { q_c \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left[\\sum^{q < q_c}_{{\\bf q}}q^2\\,n { _ { \\downarrow}}(q)-\\frac{n_4}{2\\pi } \\ln(q_ca)\\right ] + n_4\\frac{\\ln 2 -c}{4\\pi \\mu } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we recall that @xmath165",
    ". this result can be checked explicitly in the molecular case ( see appendix a ) .",
    "let us see now how the above expression for the energy arises in the field theoretic formalism . to be specific we will restrict ourselves for simplicity to the case of major interest , namely the one of two fermionic species with equal populations , so that @xmath221 . since all the @xmath14 and @xmath16 quantities are equal ,",
    "we do not write explicitely this index . we consider also the non zero temperature case since it does not make any problem .",
    "we deal first with the case of a normal system , and then extend the results to the superfluid case .",
    "we consider first the large @xmath6 dependence of @xmath222 . for free fermions at temperature @xmath223 , the density distribution has an exponential tail proportional to @xmath224 .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , interactions modify this behaviour and give rise on general grounds to a @xmath0 dependence which dominates the exponential tail .",
    "this is explicit in the weak coupling domain where the interaction can be treated perturbatively and the scattering length @xmath2 is small , as it has been done by belyakov @xcite at zero temperature : @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the fermi momentum @xmath227 .    in the general case the distribution @xmath222 is obtained from the temperature green s function @xmath228 , where @xmath229 ( with @xmath167 an integer and @xmath230 ) is the matsubara frequency , by : @xmath231 where @xmath232 .",
    "we separate out in this equation the free particle contribution by writing dysons s equation : @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the free particle green s function @xmath235^{-1}$ ] , with @xmath236 the free particle kinetic energy , and @xmath237 is the self - energy . the first term in eq.([eqdys ] )",
    "gives in eq.([eqn ] ) the free particle contribution , namely the fermi distribution .",
    "for large @xmath6 its exponential tail mentionned above is completely dominated by the algebraic decay @xmath0 that we will obtain .",
    "hence we are left only with the second term . for large @xmath6 , implying a large kinetic energy for the particle , we expect the effect of interaction to be small in the same spirit as the born approximation in this regime .",
    "since @xmath238 describes this effect we expect it to be small .",
    "hence we may to lowest order replace in this second term @xmath239 by @xmath234 . on the other hand we replace , in a standard way @xcite , the summation over matsubara frequencies by a frequency integration over a contour @xmath240 encircling the imaginary axis in the anticlockwise direction .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the dominant contribution to @xmath222 at large @xmath6 : @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "the contour can be deformed into the sum of a contour enclosing the positive frequency @xmath243 half - plane and another contour enclosing the negative frequency @xmath244 half - plane , both being in the clockwise direction .",
    "closing the contour at infinity in the @xmath243 half - plane is allowed by the presence of the fermi distribution @xmath245 , and closing it at infinity in the @xmath244 half - plane by the presence of the @xmath246 factor , which is then omitted since it does not play any other role .",
    "now contributions from the double pole at @xmath247 will contain from the fermi distribution a factor @xmath224 which makes them negligible .",
    "similarly @xmath248 has also singularities with frequencies which are large and positive , when @xmath6 is large .",
    "the fermi distribution @xmath245 will again make their contribution exponentially small . on the other hand , as it is shown in details in appendix [ b ]",
    ", @xmath248 has a pole at @xmath249 for large @xmath6 , that is deep in the @xmath244 half - plane . roughly speaking this pole appears since a @xmath14 particle with large @xmath94 and @xmath250 will scatter with a @xmath16 particle with essentially opposite parameters @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "this happens because , just as in section [ detder ] , the large values occur for the relative motion , but not for the center of mass motion",
    ". then the @xmath16 particle propagator has a pole at @xmath253 , which produces a pole for @xmath248 at the same frequency .    for this pole ,",
    "we have merely @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "if we call @xmath256 the corresponding residue of @xmath248 , we obtain in this way : @xmath257 hence we see that the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath222 at large @xmath6 emerges quite naturally in this approach .",
    "we note that our analysis may seem inconsistent , since we have first argued that @xmath248 should be small for large @xmath6 , but then considered a pole of @xmath248 , in the vicinity of which it is large .",
    "the justification is that , as long as the contour is far away from the pole , @xmath248 is indeed small everywhere on the contour .",
    "making use of the pole is then a convenient way to calculate the contour integral .",
    "we consider now the expression of the energy .",
    "it can be written in terms of the green s function by a standard formula @xcite which bears from the start a strong analogy with the expression found by tan @xcite : @xmath258 where again @xmath232 .",
    "this equation includes an overall factor 2 , coming from summation over spin .",
    "the essence of this formula is that , calculating @xmath259 by heisenberg equations of motion , one finds @xmath260 , that is the kinetic energy @xmath261 plus twice the interaction energy @xmath262 . adding the kinetic energy @xmath261 , which gives the @xmath263 term in eq.([eqengen ] ) , leads to @xmath264 . in practice eq.([eqengen ] ) is not so useful since one has to deal carefully with the divergent behaviour occuring for large @xmath265 and large @xmath6 , which is quite painful numerically . in this respect the number equation eq.([eqn ] ) is much more convenient .",
    "now , to single out clearly the kinetic energy contribution , we can rewrite eq.([eqengen ] ) as : @xmath266 the first term is just the kinetic energy @xmath267 . in the second term , which is just @xmath262",
    ", we can again replace the matsubara frequency summation by the same contour integrals as above .",
    "moreover the quantity appearing in this summation is just @xmath268 .",
    "however the term @xmath269 gives a zero contribution to these closed contour integrals .",
    "hence we are left with : @xmath270 we can now analyze the behaviour of the interaction energy term for large @xmath6 , as we have done above for the particle number . in this range",
    "@xmath248 is small so we may replace @xmath271 by @xmath272 .",
    "hence we have to deal with the same expression as in eq.([eqnk ] ) , except that @xmath272 is not squared .",
    "following the same arguments we obtain for large @xmath6 : @xmath273 hence we have shown explicitely that the large @xmath6 behaviour of the interaction energy comes in to cancel the divergent behaviour of the kinetic energy .",
    "naturally this is the expected result .",
    "accordingly we may write : @xmath274 + \\sum_{\\bf k } \\left[\\frac{m r_{\\sigma}}{k^2}-\\frac{1}{2i\\pi } \\int_{\\mathcal c } d\\omega   \\,f(\\frac{\\omega } { t})\\,\\sigma({\\bf k},\\omega)g({\\bf k},\\omega)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , from eq.([eqnkgdk ] ) and eq.([eqintgdk ] ) , both brackets give convergent integrals for large @xmath6 .",
    "the first term is just the kinetic energy from which , according to eq.([eqnkgdk ] ) , the large @xmath6 behaviour has been subtracted . by comparison with eq.([eqfin ] ) , the second term in eq.([eqen2 ] ) is just @xmath275 , a result by no means obvious .",
    "we are now in a situation where we can calculate the energy from three different formulas , as we explain just below . for the exact theory they would naturally give the same result .",
    "however if we use an approximate scheme , the results are expected to be different .",
    "the differences can , in some rough way , be seen as a measure of the errors resulting from the approximation .",
    "hence it is of interest to make such a comparison .",
    "specifically we have taken as an example the ladder approximation @xcite at unitarity and we have performed numerical calculations of the energy as a function of temperature in this approximation .",
    "we use three different ways to obtain the energy .",
    "our first expression for the energy is the general one eqs.([eqenc],[eqen2 ] ) .",
    "the second one is the energy formula found by tan , that is eq.([eqfin ] ) with equal masses .",
    "finally we use the non - interacting gas scaling relation @xmath276 between the grand potential @xmath277 and the energy @xmath278 , which is also valid at unitarity @xcite due to the lack of any microscopic energy scale .",
    "we calculate the grand potential itself _ via _ the density @xmath279 ( obtained by integration of @xmath222 ) using the thermodynamic relation @xmath280 ( we have used the fact that @xmath277 goes to @xmath281 in the high temperature regime @xmath282 ) . as noted above this last method",
    "is much more convenient numerically than the two others , since there are no convergence problems for large @xmath6 in the @xmath94 summation .",
    "the results of these numerical calculations are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we have checked that we recover the proper high temperature behavior ( virial expansion ) with the three methods , as it should be .",
    "this common evolution toward the virial result is clearer in the inset , where the results are shown with an extended scale , but this convergence is fairly slow .",
    "the results of the three methods are fairly close , which is coherent with the fact that we expect the ladder approximation to be reasonably good , mostly toward higher temperatures .",
    "indeed at lower temperature the differences between the three results are growing , mostly for the result of the tan formula .",
    "this is clearly due to the proximity of the superfluid critical temperature , which occurs at @xmath283 in this approximation .",
    "the major numerical problem with the use of eq.([eqfin ] ) is to obtain the proper coefficient of @xmath0 in the large momentum behaviour of @xmath222 .",
    "this requires in particular to be sure that the asymptotic regime is reached numerically .",
    "the same problem arises in eq.([eqen2 ] ) since one must find numerically that , for large @xmath6 , the kinetic energy is exactly balanced by the interaction energy . in the present case of the ladder approximation , we can check that the asymptotic regime as been reached since we have analytical expressions . in order to check numerically this large momentum behaviour of the contributions coming into the two brackets of eq.([eqen2 ] ) , we have performed , as we indicate specifically below , an expansion of the occupation number @xmath222 and of the interaction energy term up to order @xmath284 and @xmath285 respectively .",
    "as indicated in the above subsection the self - energy is small in the large momentum and frequency limit and we can expand the green s function in powers of the self - energy .",
    "hence we have for the occupation number and the interaction energy term : @xmath286    we start from equation ( b1 ) and following the arguments given above and detailed in appendix b , we neglect the contribution coming from the pole of the green s function , that gives exponentially small terms , and we only consider the contribution from the cut of the vertex @xmath287 on the real frequency axis .",
    "following @xcite , we call this self - energy contribution @xmath288 :    @xmath289    with @xmath290 , and @xmath291 .",
    "the bose distribution effectively limits the frequency @xmath277 to be at most a few @xmath223 and the @xmath292-integral is therefore effectively bounded .",
    "similarly to what is done in appendix b , we consider the singularities of the self - energy located at @xmath293 . in the large momentum @xmath294 and large frequency @xmath295 limit",
    ", we expand the free green s function in eq.([eq : sigma_gamma ] ) in power of @xmath296 , leading to :    @xmath297    where    @xmath298    in this limit , the contribution to the self - energy due to the cut of the vertex @xmath287 is a sum of poles of order @xmath299 located at @xmath300 . in eq.([eq : n_k ] ) , only the second term is of interest , since the first one gives the fermi distribution which does not contribute to the algebraic tail .",
    "so we use the expansion eq.([eq : sigma_dev ] ) in eq.([eq : n_k ] ) and find the following expansion for large wave vector @xmath6 :    @xmath301    the first three terms of this expansion give the dominant contribution .",
    "indeed , it is easily checked that the term of order @xmath302 in eq.([eq : n_k ] ) give contributions at least of order @xmath303 .",
    "@xmath304 does not depend on @xmath94 while the @xmath94 dependence of @xmath305 vanishes after angular integration .",
    "for the coefficient @xmath306 we can write @xmath307 . finally we find for the particle distribution in the large momentum limit :    @xmath308    comparing with eq.([eqnkgdk ] ) we see that @xmath304 is identical to the coefficient @xmath309 defined in the above subsection .",
    "we have checked the numerical convergence in the large @xmath6 limit by comparing the second term in our expansion eq.([nkfin1 ] ) with our numerical results .",
    "the coefficients are identical with a precision of less than one percent .",
    "we can perform the same analysis for the interaction energy term in eq.([eq : e_int_k ] ) and we find the following expansion :    @xmath310    here also we have checked the numerical convergence with a precision of less than one percent .",
    "compared to the normal state , we have now to modify the dyson s equation eq.([eqdys ] ) to take into account @xcite the anomalous self - energy @xmath311 and the anomalous propagator @xmath312 .",
    "we have : @xmath313 again for large @xmath6 , we have to lowest order @xmath314 and @xmath315 small .",
    "for such a large @xmath6 we expect this normal self - energy @xmath315 to behave as in the normal state , discussed in the preceding subsection . on the other hand",
    "the anomalous self - energy is expected to go to a constant , without any singular behaviour .",
    "this implies from eq.([eqdysonb ] ) that @xmath312 is small . in this case the first term in the right - hand side of eq.([eqdysonb ] ) is negligible and from the second term we have : @xmath316 substitution into eq.([eqdysona ] ) gives : @xmath317\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , in addition to the pole at @xmath249 coming as discussed above in @xmath315 , the last term gives also a pole at the same place from the explicit factor @xmath318 .",

    "actually the additional term is well - known in the case of bcs theory which gives indeed , with standard notations , @xmath321 for large @xmath6 .",
    "going now to the expression for the energy , there is naturally no modification in eq.([eqenb ] ) . on the other hand we have now , in the second term of eq.([eqenb",
    "] ) involving @xmath322 , to make use of the appropriate dyson s equation eq.([eqdysona ] ) .",
    "this leads , instead of eq.([eqenc ] ) , to : @xmath323\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the large @xmath6 analysis goes essentially as in the normal state , and is similar to the one for the particle distribution since there is only a factor @xmath234 which is different in the two calculations .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the large momentum algebraic tail in the particle distribution and the energy formula found by tan associated with this tail .",
    "we have provided a simple derivation of this energy formula , which rests on the fact that , in evaluating this energy for the short range potential under consideration , the interaction energy contribution is zero in most of phase space , which makes it negligible .",
    "hence only the kinetic energy has to be calculated .",
    "the basis of the derivation is the careful subtraction of the kinetic energy divergent contribution for interparticle distance less than the potential range .",
    "this derivation is easily generalized to particles with different masses , to arbitrary mixtures , and to two - dimensional space .",
    "we have then shown how the algebraic tail arises naturally in the field theoretical many - body approach , from the analytic structure of the self - energy . making use of these ingredients",
    "we have shown how , starting from a standard general expression of the energy in terms of the green s function , one obtains a formula with a kinetic energy part which has the same structure as in the formula found by tan .",
    "this has been done both in the normal and in the superfluid state .",
    "finally we have taken the various exact formulas allowing to obtain the energy , and we have compared in the normal state at unitarity the resulting numerical values obtained within the ladder approximation .",

    "we are also very grateful to d. dhumires and n. regnault for their recurring help in numerical matters .",

    ". on one hand @xmath364 has a simple pole at @xmath365 . on the other hand the singularities of @xmath361",
    "correspond first to the continuum of scattering states with energy @xmath366 , arising from the product of the two @xmath234 in eq.([eqgam ] ) .",
    "in addition there is the possibility of a bound state of the two particles , corresponding to a zero of the right - hand side of eq.([eqgam ] ) . as a result",
    "the spectrum of these singularities has some lower bound @xmath367 . on the other hand for large @xmath292",

    "now let us first consider the contribution from the pole of @xmath369 in eq.([sigmagen ] ) , located at @xmath370 . the bose factor @xmath371 will produce a factor @xmath372 , which for large @xmath6 implies an exponentially small factor @xmath224 .",
    "this makes the corresponding contribution to the self - energy irrelevant for the algebraic tail of @xmath373 .",

    "hence we conclude that the pole of @xmath234 in eq.([sigmagen ] ) gives no contribution to this tail , which comes accordingly only from the contribution of @xmath381 .    for this contribution",
    "the dependence of @xmath382 on frequency comes explicitely from the @xmath234 term , and it has poles for @xmath383 . here",
    "@xmath384 runs over the frequencies of the singularities of @xmath381 , but in practice the bose factor limits them to some finite range @xmath385 .",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath292 is bounded ( just as above the terms produced by the tail of the bose factor will necessarily have an exponential factor and do not contribute to the algebraic tail of @xmath373 ) .",
    "hence , for large @xmath386 , we obtain from the @xmath234 term a single pole located at @xmath387 .",
    "the corresponding residue is , from eq.([sigmagen ] ) : @xmath388 where @xmath389 is a clockwise contour enclosing only the singularities of @xmath381 and the last expression ( with @xmath390 ) is the real axis integral obtained by calculating the contour integral from the jump of the imaginary part of @xmath391 across the real frequency axis .",

    "we may express @xmath394 in terms of the standard @xcite full vertex @xmath395 by isolating the hartree term in the self - energy .",

    "those with large @xmath159 ( i.e. with small @xmath403 ) will be located at high frequency @xmath384 , and the bose factor produces an exponential factor which makes them irrelevant .",
    "we are left only with contributions arising for @xmath159 small compared to @xmath94 , in which case @xmath239 can again be replaced by @xmath234 .",
    "this produces for @xmath248 an explicit pole at @xmath387 , with a residue : @xmath404 actually it seems physically reasonable that , in the large @xmath94 limit , @xmath405 depends only on @xmath406 .",
    "indeed this limit corresponds to a short range scattering between two @xmath14 and @xmath16 particles . in this case , in a way analogous to the one discussed in section [ detder ] for the energy formula , this scattering should be essentially described by two - body physics .",
    "the situation is then similar to the one found in the ladder approximation .",
