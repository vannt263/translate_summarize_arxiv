    ", our analysis will be concentrated on the cases with @xmath5 , namely    @xmath6    the interest in spinors satisfying equations ( [ twistor_eqn ] ) or ( [ kspinor_eqn ] ) stems from their potential use in the characterisation of initial data sets yielding developments of a particular petrov type .",
    "an ultimate goal of this analysis is to yield a characterisation of initial data sets for the schwarzschild or kerr spacetimes",
    ".    equation ( [ twistor_eqn ] ) is usually called the _ twistor equation_. it is well known that its solvability imposes very strong restrictions on the curvature ( weyl tensor ) of the spacetime .",
    "one of these restrictions is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the weyl spinor see section [ section : conventions ] for more information on the conventions being used .",
    "the latter condition will occur if and only if the spacetime is of petrov type n see @xcite .",
    "therefore if we are able to find conditions on a vacuum initial data set ensuring the existence of a spinor @xmath9 fulfilling the twistor equation on at least an open subset of the development , then these conditions will also guarantee that such a subset is of petrov type n. these explicit conditions are presented in theorem [ typen : data ] .",
    "equation ( [ kspinor_eqn ] ) has more physical relevance , as it can be shown that all petrov type d vacuum solutions to the einstein field equations and in particular the schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes possess a valence-2 killing spinor @xcite see proposition [ theorem : rigidity ] in the appendix . in any case , if the spacetime has a valence-2 killing spinor then it has to be algebraically special and must satisfy the integrability condition @xmath10 further , if the valence-2 killing spinor is non - null i.e .",
    "its principal spinors are not repeated then it has to be of petrov type d @xcite . if the valence-2 killing spinor is null , then it can be shown that the weyl tensor has to be of petrov type n see again proposition [ theorem : rigidity ] in the appendix for a proof of this statement .",
    "hence if we could find conditions ensuring that a non - null valence-2 killing spinor exists in at least a neighbourhood of the initial data set then we could conclude that in such a neighbourhood the spacetime is of type d. this idea is the core of theorem [ theorem : characterisationtyped ] .",
    "another interesting feature about vacuum spacetimes admitting a spinor @xmath11 solving ( [ kspinor_eqn ] ) is that the vector @xmath12 , defined in terms of its associated spinor @xmath13 by @xmath14 is a possibly complex _ killing vector_. thus , one has @xmath15",
    "this paper is organised as follows : basic conventions followed in this paper are given in section [ section : conventions ] .",

    "section [ section : kvector ] is devoted to the study of conditions killing initial data , kid which ensure the existence of killing vectors in the development of a vacuum initial data set .",
    "although these conditions are well - known , they are usually derived and presented in a tensor form which is not suitable for this work .",
    "we carry out this derivation in spinor form , so that it also illustrates procedures to be used later . in section [ section :",
    "twistor_data ] , we find the necessary and sufficient conditions which a vacuum initial data set must fulfil for the existence of a twistor in a neighbourhood of the data development . similarly , in section [ section : killing_spinor_data ] conditions are derived for the existence of a valence-2 killing spinor in the data development .",
    "the main results of the paper are contained in theorem [ typen : data ] , where it is shown when the development of a vacuum initial data set has a petrov type n region , and in theorem [ theorem : characterisationtyped ] which provides a similar result for petrov type d.    in order to prove some of the results presented in this paper , long computations with spinors are needed .",

    "its space - spinor counterpart is given by @xmath61 .",
    "another important example is the spatial metric @xmath62 whose space spinor equivalent can be obtained by using the second and third expressions of ( [ spatial_soldering_properties ] ) : @xmath63 in order to avoid complicating the notation , the same kernel letter will be used to denote a spatial tensor and its space spinor equivalent ; the nature of the relevant object will be indicated in the text or in most cases it will be clear from the context .",
    "an important issue is to find when a given @xmath64 spinor arises from a spatial tensor and thus is a @xmath47 spinor . in order to answer this question we need to introduce the hermitian conjugation operation . given any spinor @xmath65 we define its hermitian conjugate as @xmath66 where the overline denotes the standard complex conjugation .",
