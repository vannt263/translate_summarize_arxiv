    "experiments with atomic bose - einstein condensates driven by an external perturbation have allowed verification of the mean - field description of the condensed phase in a dynamical regime where the system responds by collective motion . typically , a periodic perturbation ( with a particular symmetry ) of a trapping potential was used to excite the bose gas @xcite , although other kinds of trap distortion leading , for instance , to scissors mode excitations @xcite or the transverse monopole mode excitation in an elongated condensate@xcite were also tried .",
    "the investigation of the low energy collective modes of the condensate in the zero - temperature limit @xcite has revealed that the mean - field description of that system ( i.e. , based on the gross - pitaevskii equation ) works well @xcite .",
    "however , when the study of low - lying excitations was extended to include the measurement of frequencies and damping rates as a function of temperature @xcite , it became clear that a new theory of an interacting bose gas at nonzero temperatures is required .",
    "the jila experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite showed two effects .",
    "first , it was found that two collective modes with different symmetries ( quadrupole modes with angular momenta equal to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) behave in qualitatively different ways .",
    "when the temperature increases , they exhibit a frequency shift in opposite directions",
    ". moreover , for the @xmath0 mode a rather sudden upward shift is observed , suggesting the existence of a characteristic temperature which is approximately @xmath2 of the critical temperature for the corresponding ideal gas .",
    "secondly , the damping of the collective oscillations turned out to be dramatically dependent on temperature , showing that the condensate modes are damped even faster than the noncondensed fraction while approaching the critical temperature .",
    "all these puzzling findings triggered a lot of theoretical work and after a few years resulted in the development of zaremba - nikuni - griffin formalism @xcite and the second - order quantum field theory @xcite for a bose gas .",
    "recently , another attempt to describe finite - temperature properties of low - lying collective modes was undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite within the approximation called the projected gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the zaremba - nikuni - griffin formalism @xcite applied to the results of the jila experiment gives relatively good agreement .",
    "also the calculations based on the second - order quantum field theory @xcite show a good agreement with experimental data .",
    "however , already these two approaches differ when considering their fundamentals . for example",
    ", the first one neglects the phonon character of the low - lying energy modes , the anomalous average , as well as the beliaev processes .",
    "regarding the jila experiment , for the @xmath0 mode , the zaremba - nikuni - griffin method predicts an additional branch of condensate frequencies , so far not observed experimentally .",
    "no such branch is found within the second - order theory of ref .",
    "furthermore , this approach predicts a single frequency of condensate response for a particular temperature , regardless of driving frequency , and hence the notion of a natural condensate frequency is meaningful .",
    "this strongly differs from what is reported in jackson and zaremba @xcite , where the condensate response depends on the driving frequency of the whole system ( condensed and noncondensed parts ) .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of both approaches in the context of jila experiment can be found in a recent review article @xcite .",
    "another formalism , based on the projected gross - pitaevskii equation , used to model the jila experiment @xcite produces good agreement with experimental data up to @xmath3 , and for the @xmath1 mode at higher temperatures .",
    "however , it fails to predict the sudden upward frequency shift for the @xmath0 mode at this temperature @xcite .",
    "this failure is perhaps related to the way the cutoff parameter ( which splits the space of modes into the highly occupied ones that are described in terms of the classical field , and the others that are sparsely occupied and require , in principle , a quantum treatment ) is chosen .",
    "the details of the splitting procedure within the projected gross - pitaevskii equation approach are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we apply the classical field approximation in the version described in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of a trapped interacting bose gas at nonzero temperatures driven by an external perturbation as in the experiment of ref .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to check whether the classical field approximation is able to reproduce , at least qualitatively , the findings of jila experiment .",
    "this is an especially important task because of the recently reported failure @xcite to explain the behavior of the @xmath0 mode within the projected gross - pitaevskii equation method , which is conceptually very close to our classical field approximation . on the other hand , although the other existing theories @xcite and @xcite both lead to relatively good agreement with the experiment @xcite , they somehow contradict each other conceptually as discussed in the previous paragraph . it would be nice to have an alternative view of the processes going on in the perturbed bose gas . finally , the approaches @xcite and @xcite have some difficulties in describing the dynamics of the thermal cloud , especially in the @xmath1 mode .",
    "in fact , no predictions for thermal component frequencies in the @xmath1 mode are given in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , within the projected gross - pitaevskii equation method , at higher temperatures , the thermal cloud ( in fact , for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes ) oscillates at frequencies much lower than in experiment .",
    "the classical field approximation has already been applied in static and dynamical regimes for a uniform and harmonically trapped systems ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "this approach was used to investigate the thermodynamics of an interacting gas @xcite as well as dynamical processes like the photoassociation of molecules @xcite , the dissipative dynamics of a vortex @xcite , the superfluidity in ring - shaped traps @xcite , or the thermalization in spinor condensates @xcite .",
    "the classical field approximation was also tested at a quantitative level when e.g. the bogoliubov - popov quasiparticle energy spectrum in a uniform bose gas was obtained @xcite or when the process of splitting of doubly quantized vortices in dilute bose - einstein condensates @xcite was studied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ method ] we describe the classical field approximation for a trapped bose gas with particular attention on how the equilibrium state is obtained and on the quality of the solution in comparison with the equilibrium states calculated within the self - consistent hartree - fock method .",
    "[ mode0 ] discusses the results ( response frequencies and damping rates ) for the quadrupole @xmath0 collective mode for parameters as in jila experiment @xcite while in sec .",
    "[ mode2 ] we do the same for @xmath1 excitation . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "a good starting point to introduce the classical field approximation is the usual heisenberg equation of motion for the bosonic field operator @xmath4 which annihilates an atom at point @xmath5 and time @xmath6 .",
    "the field operator @xmath4 fulfills standard commutation relations : @xmath7=\\delta ( { \\rm { \\bf r}}-{\\rm { \\bf r } ' } ) \\label{comrel}\\ ] ] with other equal time commutation relations for @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] being zeros .",
    "the equation of motion reads : @xmath10 \\hat { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t )    \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + g\\ , \\hat{\\psi } ^+({\\rm { \\bf r}},t ) \\hat { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t ) \\hat { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t )    \\ , . \\label{heisenberg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we assume the time - dependent trapping potential @xmath11 and the usual contact interaction for colliding atoms .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath12 is expressed in terms of the s - wave scattering length @xmath13 .",
    "next , we expand the field operator @xmath4 in the basis of one - particle wave functions @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a set of one - particle quantum numbers : @xmath16 now , we assume that some of the modes used in the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) are macroscopically occupied and extend the original bogoliubov idea @xcite by replacing all operators @xmath17 corresponding to these modes by c - numbers .",
    "when only macroscopically occupied modes are considered , the field operator @xmath4 is turned into the complex wave function @xmath18 and the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) takes the form : @xmath19 the upper index in the summation tells us that , indeed , the wave function @xmath18 is expanded only over a finite number of states , i.e. those which are macroscopically occupied .",
    "we call the wave function @xmath18 the classical field .",
    "this is analogous to the way that intense electromagnetic waves can be treated . in spite of consisting of photons ,",
    "an intense light beam is well characterized by the classical electric and magnetic fields .",
    "since the experiments with dilute atomic gases are performed with millions of atoms it seems to be a plausible approximation to use the classical field to describe atoms in analogy with electric and magnetic fields for photons .",
    "obviously , the classical field obeys the following equation : @xmath20 { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t )    \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + g\\ , { \\psi } ^*({\\rm { \\bf r}},t ) { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t ) { \\psi } ( { \\rm { \\bf r}},t )    \\ , .",
    "\\label{cfequation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we usually implement the cutoff parameter @xmath21 by solving the eq .",
    "( [ cfequation ] ) on a rectangular grid using the fast fourier transform technique .",
    "the spatial grid step determines the maximal momentum per particle ( and hence the energy ) in the system whereas the use of the fourier transform implies a projection in momentum space .",
    "the equation ( [ cfequation ] ) looks like the usual gross - pitaevskii equation describing the bose - einstein condensate at zero temperature .",
    "however , here the interpretation of the complex wave function @xmath18 is different .",
    "it describes all the atoms in the system , both those in a condensate and in a thermal cloud .",
    "therefore , the question appears how to split the classical field @xmath18 into the condensed and noncondensed fractions . for",
    "that we use the definition of a bose - einstein condensation proposed originally by penrose and onsager @xcite . according to this definition the condensate",
    "is assigned to the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue of a one - particle density matrix .",
    "so , we built the one - particle density matrix in the following way : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total number of particles .",
    "however , and here comes the surprise  since ( [ denmat ] ) is just the spectral decomposition of a one - particle density matrix , this would imply that the classical field @xmath18 is the condensate wave function and that all atoms are in the condensate . to split the classical field into the condensed and thermal fractions",
    "one first realizes that the high energy solutions of eq .",
    "( [ cfequation ] ) oscillate rapidly in time and space . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection process is always performed with limited spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "therefore , it becomes clear that the measurement process with its limited resolution involves a kind of averaging ( coarse - graining ) of eq .",
    "( [ denmat ] ) .",
    "again , an analogy with electromagnetic waves is in place . a partially coherent light beam exhibits complicated spatial and temporal behavior on short scales , in fact too complicated to be typically measured .",
    "what is important are then the correlation functions at long enough spatial and temporal separation , averaged over the smaller time intervals and space segments .",
    "similarly here , the averaging over time and/or space of the one - particle density matrix ( [ denmat ] ) results in a partial loss of the information contained in the classical field @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the mixed state emerges out of the pure one .    in a typical experiment ,",
    "what is measured is the column density along some direction .",
    "hence , we also implement the coarse - graining procedure in our numerics in this manner as : @xmath24    solving the eigenvalue problem for a coarse - grained density matrix ( [ rhoave ] ) results in a decomposition : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the relative occupations of macroscopically occupied modes @xmath27 . defining the dominant eigenvalue as @xmath28 , the condensate wave function ( normalized to @xmath29 )",
    "can be written as : @xmath30 all the other modes contribute to the thermal density which is , therefore , given by : @xmath31    the appropriateness of the averaging ( [ rhoave ] ) for obtaining the large eigenvalues of a coarse - grained density matrix was verified by us in various ways .",
    "for example , we checked that for the classical field at equilibrium this procedure gives the same results as averaging over a long enough time .",
    "prescription ( [ rhoave ] ) also works at zero temperature ( when all atoms are expected to be in a condensate ) , having been successfully tested in this respect in the demanding case of a lattice of bent vortices ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .    according to the description given above the splitting of the system into condensed and noncondensed components is a result of bose statistics , interaction , and the measurement process . unlike the alternative approaches @xcite we",
    "do not impose a two - component character of the system from the beginning . also , our version of the classical field method is well suited to describe single realizations of the experiment since it corresponds to a microcanonical ensemble , as opposed to the competing approach @xcite , which deals with canonical ensembles .",
    "an initial classical field is generated from the ground state solution of eq .",
    "( [ cfequation ] ) by adding appropriate random disturbance .",
    "an inspection of that equation indicates that only the product of the coupling constant @xmath32 and the total number of atoms @xmath23 enters it .",
    "therefore , we normalize the initial classical field @xmath33 to unity . the norm of @xmath18 is then one of the constants of motion of eq .",
    "( [ cfequation ] ) .",
    "another constant of motion is the total energy .",
    "such an initial state is then propagated according to eq .",
    "( [ cfequation ] ) until the constituent energies ( kinetic , trap , and interaction ) cease to change systematically in time and exhibit only fluctuations . in this way",
    "the classical field at thermal equilibrium , corresponding to the particular values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , is obtained .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ cfeq ] , where we plot cuts of the total density , the condensate , and the thermal densities according to the prescription detailed in the previous section . here",
    ", the equilibrium classical field describes a degenerate @xmath36rb bose gas in a magnetic trap with frequencies @xmath37hz and @xmath38hz as in the experiment of ref .",
    "other parameters are : @xmath39 and @xmath40 in units of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively",
    ". they result in a condensate fraction @xmath43 .",
    "a bimodal distribution ( thick solid line ) is clearly visible .",
    "now we have to solve the problem how to find the number of particles assigned to the classical field at equilibrium and how to determine the temperature of the system .",
    "this can be done in two ways .",
    "the first is given here , the second in sec .",
    "[ hfmethod ] . to begin with",
    ", having the classical field at equilibrium one can project the field @xmath18 on the harmonic oscillator states obtaining in this way the relative populations of these states . fig .",
    "[ relpop ] shows relative populations for @xmath44 and @xmath45 as a function of the harmonic oscillator states energy ( precisely , the time average over @xmath46ms is plotted ) .",
    "the maximal one - particle mode energy is determined by the momentum cutoff @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "an important observation is made when one looks at the energy accumulated in harmonic oscillator states , see fig .",
    "[ ktn ] . for higher energy states the product @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the relative population and the harmonic oscillator state energy , respectively ) becomes constant . on the other hand , for highly occupied modes ( i.e. , modes satisfying @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the chemical potential ) the quantum bose - einstein distribution reduces to the classical equipartition distribution . for the classical field",
    "studied here the equipartition extends all the way to the cutoff energy : @xmath54 which can be written equivalently as @xmath55 therefore , since energy equipartition is established , the higher energy harmonic oscillator states become the quasiparticle modes . in fig .",
    "[ ktn ] we determine the ratio @xmath56 to be @xmath57 . having the ratio @xmath56 we now find from eq .",
    "( [ qppop ] ) the relative populations of high energy quasiparticle modes .",
    "in particular , we get the relative population of the least occupied modes which belong to the classical field . in the example here , they are @xmath58 ( based on formula ( [ qppop ] ) with @xmath56 obtained above ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , arguments are given that the best match between this method and the ideal bose gas occurs when the occupation of the least occupied mode is @xmath59 .",
    "these are based on the comparison between the probability distribution of the ideal bose gas and its classical field counterpart .",
    "assuming , then that the average number of atoms in this least - occupied mode is @xmath60 we can retrieve the total number of atoms in the system and its temperature separately .",
    "for the example here , these are @xmath61 and @xmath62nk .",
    "since no data on the population of the cutoff mode are available for a weakly interacting bose gas considered here we compare in table [ tab0 ] the temperature of the system and the total number of atoms for various values of @xmath63 .",
    ".temperature and the total number of atoms obtained by projecting the classical field on the harmonic oscillator states of the example described in sec .",
    "[ eqstates ] for different values of cutoff parameter . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , the bose gas is disturbed by a sinusoidal perturbation to the trapping potential . since the classical field describes both the condensed and noncondensed atoms , the disturbance of the classical field means that both components are simultaneously perturbed . to excite the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 quadrupole modes , the perturbation of the trapping potential takes the form : @xmath64   \\ , ,    \\nonumber   \\\\",
    "\\label{pertur}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the driving frequency and @xmath66 is a phase shift between the @xmath67 and @xmath68 direction perturbations .",
    "the choice of the phase shift @xmath66 determines the symmetry of the excited collective mode - for @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) mode is excited .",
    "the perturbation , as in the experiment , lasts for @xmath71ms and the amplitude @xmath72 takes small value to avoid any nonlinear effects .",
    "after the perturbation is turned off , the classical field is oscillating in time .",
    "is it possible that the condensed and noncondensed components ( extracted from the single classical field ) exhibit oscillations with different frequencies ? to answer these question we split the classical field into the condensate and the thermal cloud in the way described in sec . [ formalism ] and calculate the widths of both components from the formula : @xmath73 results are shown in fig .",
    "[ oscillations ] for the @xmath0 mode .",
    "solid symbols ( upper frame ) represent the condensate widths , whereas the open symbols ( middle frame ) stand for thermal cloud widths .",
    "solid lines in both frames are fits by an exponentially damped sine waves : @xmath74 to numerical data . as in the experiment",
    ", fits are performed based on five initial oscillations",
    ". the lower frame shows , indeed , that condensate and thermal components oscillate with different frequencies . moreover , these oscillations are phase shifted and the condensate oscillates slower than the thermal cloud .    in figs .",
    "[ m0fr ] and [ m0dr ] we summarize our results for the @xmath0 mode . in fig .",
    "[ m0fr ] we plot the frequencies of the condensate and thermal fractions response to the external perturbation for various temperatures together with the experimental data of ref .",
    "black solid and open symbols represent data for a condensate ( upper frame ) and a thermal cloud ( lower frame ) for various driving frequencies according to the legend attached to the figure .",
    "gray symbols with error bars are the experimental results . up to temperature @xmath75",
    "both components oscillate with the same frequency , which is the natural condensate frequency for the @xmath0 collective mode . at approximately @xmath3 a rather sudden upward shift in condensate frequency",
    "is observed in the experiment .",
    "our numerics shows that at this temperature the dynamics of the thermal cloud changes .",
    "the thermal component starts to oscillate with a higher frequency approaching eventually @xmath76 which is the oscillation frequency of a thermal gas alone . for higher temperatures the thermal fraction becomes dominant and finally thermal atoms change the dynamics of the condensate in such a way that condensed atoms oscillate along with the thermal ones .",
    "unfortunately , the influence of the thermal cloud on the condensate is apparently too weak and consequently the condensate starts to oscillate with higher frequencies only for higher temperatures .",
    "our results also show that the notion of natural condensate frequency breaks down when the thermal cloud is present .",
    "the condensate response depends on the dynamics of the thermal cloud and , in fact , the possible frequencies for the condensate oscillation lie in an interval which gets wider for higher temperatures .",
    "in particular , no two branches of frequencies are visible as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ m0dr ] we compare the numerical and experimental damping rates for the oscillations of the condensed and noncondensed components .",
    "there is some discrepancy for higher temperatures where the thermal component seems to be damped too strongly in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "perhaps this increases the temperature at which the frequency of the condensate fraction shifts up .",
    "we now do the same analysis for the @xmath1 mode .",
    "the system is disturbed by changing the trapping potential according to ( [ pertur ] ) with the phase shift @xmath70 .",
    "such a perturbation excites the quadrupole @xmath1 oscillations .",
    "the classical field is split into the condensed and thermal parts and the condensate and thermal widths are calculated using formulas exhibiting the @xmath1 mode s symmetry : @xmath77 as before , these data are fitted by exponentially damped sine waves .",
    "frequencies and damping rates for the condensate and the thermal cloud are plotted in figs .",
    "[ m2fr ] and [ m2dr ] .",
    "again , the system responds in a way that depends on the driving frequency . a comment on how the authors of the experiment @xcite choose the driving frequency is in place here .",
    "they say that the driving frequency is set to match the frequency of the excitation being studied .",
    "this could make sense for @xmath0 mode where supposedly the condensed and noncondensed fractions always oscillate in phase . supposedly , because in @xcite we see only two data points ( both having frequency approximately @xmath76 ) showing the behavior of the thermal cloud in the @xmath0 mode .",
    "however , for the @xmath1 mode the frequencies at which the condensate and thermal cloud oscillate are different , and the meaning of the driving frequency as the frequency of the excitation being studied is not clear .",
    "therefore , in fig . [ m2fr ]",
    "we show our data for various driving frequencies .",
    "good agreement with experiment is found for appropriate driving frequencies up to temperatures @xmath78 . for temperatures approaching the critical one ,",
    "however , we observe the same effect as for the @xmath0 mode .",
    "the thermal cloud becomes dominant and the frequencies at which the condensate oscillates become higher . fig .",
    "[ m2fr ] shows that already for a temperature @xmath79 , with the driving frequency @xmath80 , the condensate oscillates with the frequency of the thermal cloud .",
    "such a behavior was not observed experimentally .",
    "on the other hand , it is an expected behavior , since the condensed fraction becomes smaller and smaller while the critical temperature is approached , and the dynamics should be dominated by the thermal cloud . in the case of the thermal cloud , our model predicts frequencies in agreement with the experiment ( other theoretical studies of the jila experiment either do not show results for the thermal atoms for the @xmath1 mode , or predict frequencies that are very different than observed experimentally ) .    in fig .",
    "[ m2dr ] we compare the numerical and experimental damping rates for the oscillations of the condensed and noncondensed parts of the system . as for the @xmath0 mode , there is some discrepancy for higher temperatures where the thermal cloud is damped too strongly , whereas the condensate is damped too weakly .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented in detail the construction of the classical field describing the desired number of atoms , confined in any trapping potential , at a prescribed temperature .",
    "we have studied the oscillations of the bose - einstein condensate in the presence of a thermal cloud . as in the experiment",
    ", we find the temperature dependent condensate frequency shift for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 collective oscillation modes . for the @xmath0 mode , the thermal atoms pull the condensate fraction along , and above some characteristic temperature @xmath81 the condensate tends to oscillate with the frequency of the thermal part ( approximately equal to @xmath76 ) .",
    "unfortunately , in the present version of the classical field approximation , the value of this characteristic temperature turns out to be about @xmath82 higher than the one observed in the experiment . for the @xmath1 mode ,",
    "on the other hand , the frequency at which the condensate oscillates first decreases with an increase of temperature ( the thermal cloud oscillating with its natural frequency equal to @xmath76 damps the condensate motion ) but when the temperature gets closer to the critical temperature the condensate starts to oscillate with higher frequencies , approaching the frequency of the thermal cloud .",

    "<S> , the system response to external perturbations strongly depends on the initial temperature and on the symmetry of perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> while for lower temperatures the thermal cloud follows the condensed part , for higher temperatures the thermal atoms oscillate rather with their natural frequency , whereas the condensate exhibits a frequency shift toward the thermal cloud frequency ( @xmath0 mode ) , or in the opposite direction ( @xmath1 mode ) . in the latter case , for temperatures approaching critical , we find that the condensate begins to oscillate with the frequency of the thermal atoms , as in the @xmath0 mode . a broad range of frequencies of the perturbing potential is considered . </S>"
