    "as a fundamental stochastic process , random walks have received considerable attention from the scientific society , since they found a wide range of distinct applications in various theoretical and applied fields , such as physics , chemistry , biology , computer science , among others  @xcite . among a plethora of interesting issues of random walks , trapping is an integral major one , which plays an important role in an increasing number of disciplines .",
    "the so - called trapping issue that was first introduced in  @xcite , is a random - walk problem , where a trap is positioned at a fixed location , absorbing all particles that visit it .",
    "the highly desirable quantity closed related to the trapping issue is the first - passage time ( fpt ) , also called trapping time ( tt ) .",
    "the fpt for a given site ( node , vertex ) is the time spent by the walker starting from the site to hit the trap node for the first time .",
    "the average of first - passage times over all nodes is referred to as the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) , or mean trapping time ( mtt ) , which is frequently used to measure the efficiency of the trapping problem .",
    "one of the most important questions in the research of trapping is determining its efficiency , namely , showing the dependence relation of mfpt on the size of the system where the random walks are performed .",
    "previous studies have provided the answers to the corresponding problems in some particular graphs with simple structure , such as regular lattices  @xcite , sierpinski fractals  @xcite , t - fractal  @xcite , and so forth .",
    "however , recent empirical studies  @xcite uncovered that many ( perhaps most ) real networks are scale - free characterized by a power - law degree distribution  @xcite , which can not be described by above simple graphs .",
    "thus , it appears quite natural and important to explore the trapping issue on scale - free networks . in recent work  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that scale - free property may substantially improve the efficiency of the trapping problem : the mfpt behaves linearly or sublinearly with the order ( number of nodes ) of the scale - free networks , which is in sharp contrast to the superlinear scaling obtained for above - mentioned simple graphs  @xcite .",
    "it was speculated that the high efficiency of trapping on scale - free networks is attributed to their power - law property .",
    "although scale - free feature can strongly affect the various dynamics occurring on networks , it was shown that the scale - free structure itself does not suffice to characterize some dynamical processes on networks , e.g. , synchronization  @xcite , disease spreading  @xcite , and the like .",
    "thus far , it is still unknown whether the power - law degree distribution is sufficient to characterize the behavior of trapping problem on scale - free networks .    in this paper",
    ", we study the trapping problem on the a class of scale - free networks with the same degree sequence , which are dominated by a tunable parameter @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we determine separately the explicit formulas of the mean first - passage time for the two limiting cases of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we show that in both cases the mfpt increases as a power - law function of the network order , with the exponent less than 1 for @xmath1 and equal to 1 for @xmath2 .",
    "we also study numerically the mfpt for the case of @xmath3 , finding that it is also a power - law function of network order with the exponent @xmath4 depending on parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate that in the full range of @xmath5 , @xmath4 is a decreasing function of @xmath0 , which belongs to the interval @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "our findings indicate that the power - law degree distribution by itself is not sufficient to characterize the trapping process taking place on scale - free networks .",
    "the networks in question are built iteratively  @xcite , see fig .",
    "we represent by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) the networks after @xmath9 iterations ( the number of iterations is also called generation hereafter ) .",
    "then the networks are constructed as follows . for @xmath10 , the initial network @xmath11",
    "consists of two nodes connected to each other by an edge ( a link ) . for @xmath12 , @xmath7",
    "is obtained from @xmath13 .",
    "that is to say , to obtain @xmath7 , one can replace each link existing in @xmath13 either by a connected cluster of links on the top right of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with probability @xmath0 , or by the connected cluster on the bottom right with complementary probability @xmath14 .",
    "repeat the growth process @xmath9 times , with the graphs obtained in the limit @xmath15 . in figs .",
    "[ flower ] and  [ fractal ] , we present the growing processes of two special networks corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively .    .",
    "]    let @xmath16 be the number of nodes created at generation @xmath9 , and @xmath17 the total number of all edges present at generation @xmath9 . by construction",
    ", we have @xmath18 . considering the initial condition @xmath19",
    ", it leads to @xmath20 . since each existing edge at a given generation will create two new nodes in at the next generation , then , at each generation @xmath21 ( @xmath22 )",
    "the number of newly introduced nodes is @xmath23 .",
    "thus , at generation @xmath9 the network order is @xmath24    let @xmath25 be the degree of a node @xmath26 at generation @xmath9 , which was created at generation @xmath21 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "then , @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ ki01 ] ) , it is obvious that after each new iteration the degree of a node doubles , i.e. , @xmath29    . ]",
    "the networks considered exhibit some interesting topological properties .",
    "their nodes have same degree sequence ( thus the same degree distribution ) , independent of the value of parameter @xmath0 . concretely , the networks have a power - law degree distribution with the exponent @xmath30  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "since there is no triangle in the whole class of the networks , the clustering coefficient is zero .",
    "although the degree distribution and clustering coefficient do not depend on the parameter @xmath0 , other structural characteristics are closely related to @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for @xmath1 , the network is reduced to the ( 2 , 2)-flower introduced in  @xcite . in this case , it is a small world , its average path length ( apl ) , defined as the mean of shortest distances between all pairs of nodes , grows logarithmically with the network order  @xcite ; at the same time , it is a non - fractal network  @xcite . while for @xmath2 , it is exactly the hierarchical lattice that was proposed by berker and ostlund  @xcite and was extensively studied by many authors  @xcite . for this case ,",
    "the network is not small - world with the apl increasing as a square power of the network order  @xcite ; moreover , it is fractal with the fractal dimension @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath0 increases from 0 to 1 , the networks undergo a transition from fractal to non - fractal scalings , and exhibit a crossover from ` large ' to small worlds at the same time  @xcite ; these similar phenomena are also observed in a family of treelike networks  @xcite .",
    "the peculiar topological features make the networks unique within the category of scale - free networks , since these particular structures strongly affect the dynamical processes defined on the networks . for instance",
    ", different thresholds of bond percolation were recently observed in the networks , which implies that power - law degree distribution alone does not suffice to characterize the percolation threshold on scale - free networks under bond percolation  @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will study random walks with a single immobile trap on the networks .",
    "we will show that the degree distribution is not sufficient to determine the scalings for mfpt of trapping process occurring on the networks under consideration .",
    "in this section , we study the so - called simple discrete - time random walks of a particle on network @xmath7 . at each time step , the particle ( walker ) jumps from its current location to one of its neighbors with equal probability . in particular , we focus on the trapping problem , i.e. , a special issue for random walks with a trap positioned at a given node . to this end , we first we distinguish different nodes in @xmath7 , by labeling them in the following way .",
    "the two nodes in @xmath32 have labels 1 and 2 . for each new generation",
    ", we only label the new nodes created at this generation , while we keep the labels of all pre - existing nodes unchanged . in other words",
    ", we label sequentially new nodes as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of the old nodes and @xmath35 the number of newly - created nodes . in this way , every node is labeled by a unique integer , at generation @xmath9 all nodes are labeled from 1 to @xmath36 . figures  [ labeling01 ] and  [ labeling02 ] show how the nodes are labeled for two special cases of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "labels of all nodes of @xmath37 in the case of @xmath1 . ]",
    "labels of all nodes of @xmath37 for the particular case of @xmath2 . ]",
    "we place the trap at node 1 , denoted by @xmath38 . at each time step , the particle , starting from any node except the trap @xmath38 , moves uniformly to any of its nearest neighbors .",
    "it should be mentioned that , due to the symmetry , the trap can be also situated at nodes 2 , 3 , or 4 , which has not any effect on mfpt .",
    "the special selection we made for the trap allows to address the issue conveniently .",
    "particularly , this makes it possible to analytically compute the mfpt for the two deterministic networks corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( details will be discussed below ) , because of their special structures and the convenience of identifying the trap @xmath38 since the first generation .    as mentioned above , one of the most important quantity characterizing such a trapping problem is the fpt defined as the expected time a walker takes , starting from a source node , to first reach the trap node .",
    "the significance firstly originates from the fact that the first encounter properties are relevant to those in a plethora of real situations  @xcite , including transport , disease spreading , target search , and so on . on the other hand , many other quantities can be expressed in terms of fpts , and more information about the dynamics of random walks can be extracted from the analysis of fpts  @xcite .",
    "finally , the average of first - passage times , i.e. , mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) , measures the efficiency of the trapping process : the smaller the mfpt , the higher the efficiency , and vice versa . in the following , we will determine the exact solutions to mfpt for some limiting cases , as well as the dependence relation of mfpt on the network order .",
    "let @xmath39 be the fpt for a walker initially placed at node @xmath26 to first reach the trap @xmath38 in @xmath40 .",
    "this quantity can be expressed in terms of mean residence time ( mrt )  @xcite , which is defined to be the mean time that a random walker spends at a given node prior to being absorbed by the trap . actually , the mrt is the mean number of visitations of a given node by the walker before trapping occurs .",
    "it is known that the trapping problem studied can be described by a markov chain  @xcite , whose fundamental matrix is the inverse of matrix @xmath41 that is a variant of the normalized laplacian matrix  @xcite @xmath42 for @xmath40 , and can be obtained from @xmath42 with all entries in the first row and column ( corresponding to the trap node ) setting to zeros .",
    "the entry @xmath43 of the fundamental matrix @xmath44 expresses the mean number of visitations of node @xmath45 by the particle , starting from node @xmath26 , before it is eventually trapped .",
    "thus , we have @xmath46 then , the mean first - passage time , @xmath47 , which is the average of @xmath39 over all initial nodes distributed uniformly over nodes in @xmath40 other than the trap , is given by @xmath48    equation  ( [ mfpt5 ] ) shows that the problem of determining @xmath47 is reduced to computing the sum of all elements of the fundamental matrix @xmath44 .",
    "although the expression of eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) seems compact , the complexity of inverting @xmath42 is _",
    "o_(@xmath49 ) . since the network order increases exponentially with @xmath9 , eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) becomes intractable for large @xmath9 .",
    "thus , restricted by time and computer memory , one can obtain @xmath47 through direct calculation from eq .",
    "( [ mfpt5 ] ) only for the first iterations",
    ". it would be satisfactory if good alternative computation methods could be proposed to get around this problem .",
    "what is encouraging is that the particular construction of the networks and the special choice of the trap location allow to calculate analytically mfpt to obtain a closed - form formula , at least for the two special cases of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the computation details will be provided in the following text .",
    "we first establish the scaling relation governing the evolution for @xmath39 with generation @xmath9 . in table",
    "[ tab : amta2q1 ] , we list the numerical values of @xmath39 for some nodes up to @xmath51 . from the numerical values , we can observe that for a given node @xmath26 , the relation @xmath52 holds .",
    "that is to say , upon growth of the network from generation @xmath9 to generation @xmath53 , the trapping time to first arrive at the trap increases by a factor @xmath54 .",
    "this is a basic characteristic of random walks on @xmath40 when @xmath55 , which can be established from the arguments below  @xcite .",

    ", one can easily observe that for a given node @xmath26 , its mfpt changes with the generation as @xmath58 , which can be supported by the following argument .",
    "consider a node @xmath26 in the @xmath9th generation of network @xmath40 for a particular case of @xmath2 . in the generation @xmath53 , its degree @xmath59 doubles by growing from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , different from that of the @xmath1 case , all the @xmath60 neighbors of node @xmath26 are new nodes created at generation @xmath53 .",
    "we now examine the random walks taking place in @xmath61 : let @xmath62 be the fpt originating at node @xmath26 to any of its @xmath59 old neighbors , i.e. , those nodes directly connected to @xmath26 at iteration @xmath9 ; and let @xmath63 denote fpt for going from any of the @xmath60 new neighbors of @xmath26 to one of its @xmath59 old neighbors . then the following relations hold : @xmath64 equation  ( [ mfpt6q0 ] ) has a solution @xmath65 found by eliminating @xmath63 , which means that for any pair of nodes @xmath26 and @xmath45 in @xmath40 , the fpt from @xmath26 to @xmath45 increases by a factor of 4 during the growth of the network from generation @xmath9 to generation @xmath53 .",
    "the relation @xmath58 is a basic feature for random walks on the network of the @xmath2 case , which will be applied to the derivation of the exact formula for @xmath57 .",
    "having obtaining the evolution relation of trapping time for old nodes when the network grows , we continue to derive the analytical rigorous expression for the mfpt . in what follows",
    ", we will use the same notations as those for the @xmath1 case defined above .",
    "similar to the @xmath1 case , it is easy to get the following equation : @xmath66        therefore , to determine @xmath67 , we need to find @xmath68 first , which can be obtained as follows .",
