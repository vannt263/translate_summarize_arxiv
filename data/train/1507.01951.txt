    "galactic winds are ubiquitous and important in rapidly star - forming galaxies .",
    "they are a primary source of metals in the intergalactic medium and affect the chemical evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for launching galaxy - scale outflows . among them ,",
    "the very hot wind created by supernova ( sn ) energy injection is widely used in the literature .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter cc85 ) developed a one - dimensional model for sn - driven winds with two controlling parameters : the thermalization efficiency with which sn - injected energy is converted into thermal energy , and the mass - loading efficiency , i.e. , the ratio of the hot gas mass loss rate ( @xmath4 ) to the host galaxy star formation rate ( sfr ) : @xmath5sfr .",
    "these two parameters are difficult to determine observationally .",
    "for example , observational constraints on @xmath6 have been determined for only a few galaxies , e.g. , ngc 1569 ( @xcite ) and m82 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite we derived a general constraint on @xmath6 across a wide range of galaxies from dwarf starbursts to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) using the observed linear relation between the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath7 ) and sfr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast with the observations , the cc85 model predicts @xmath8 sfr@xmath9 for the hot wind fluid if @xmath6 is a constant . thus the observed @xmath10sfr relation can be used to constrain the hot wind . by combining the cc85 model with a band - dependent calculation of the x - ray emission and comparing with recent determinations of the @xmath10sfr relation",
    "@xcite we showed that @xmath11 for sfr @xmath12 yr@xmath13 .",
    "larger values of @xmath6 would overproduce x - rays .",
    "this constraint on the hot wind outflow rate implies that the cc85 model alone can not explain the @xmath14 required by integrated constraints on stellar feedback models in a cosmological context ( i.e. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , galactic winds are known to be multi - phase , with clear evidence for neutral atomic and ionized gas in emission and absorption from multi - wavelength observations . for example , na i d absorption - line surveys provide the kinematics of neutral atomic outflows in local starbursts and high-@xmath15 star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "emission lines such as h@xmath16 , n ii , o ii , oiii have also been used to probe cool outflowing gas in star - forming galaxies ( see @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "in addition , both cool and warm molecular gas are detected in outflows in some local and high-@xmath15 galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an obvious question is whether or not the cool clouds are the dominant gas mass reservoir in the surrounding hot wind , whether or not they are accelerated by the ram pressure of the hot wind to the velocities seen ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , can clouds survive the process of acceleration to both large physical scales and large velocities in order to match the spatially - resolved morphology seen in some local systems .",
    "these same issues are directly connected to the recent finding of a potentially large cool gas reservoir on 100kpc scales in the halos of @xmath17 galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we seek general constraints on the ram pressure acceleration ( rpa ) of cool clouds over a broad parameter space that includes the hot wind properties ( thermalization and mass - loading efficiencies ) , cool cloud properties ( density , column density , and temperature ) , and galaxy properties ( star formation rate , velocity dispersion of the host gravitational potential ) from dwarf starbursts to ulirgs .",
    "our primary goal is to assess and quantify cloud survival and acceleration in hot winds for comparison with observations of cold , cool , and warm molecular and atomic gas from @xmath18k .",
    "a number of studies have discussed the interaction between cool clouds and the surrounding hot outflow in rapidly star - forming galaxies . on the observational side",
    ", the thermal soft x - ray emission shows that the hot ionized interstellar stellar medium ( ism ) has a temperature of @xmath19 kev in all kinds of starburst galaxies from dwarfs to ulirgs @xcite .",
    "the hot gas would be expected to accelerate cool clouds to a maximum terminal velocity of @xmath20kev@xmath21 km s@xmath13 , similar to the average velocities of cool outflows @xcite . on the other hand , cool gas with very high velocities above 500 km s@xmath13",
    "is also observed in some lirgs and ulirgs , which prima facie can not be explained by acceleration via ram pressure of the wind that emits in soft x - rays .",
    "thus , the very high velocity cool gas is expected to be explained by the rpa of a much hotter wind fluid associated with the diffuse hard x - ray emission .",
    "recent observations of diffuse hard x - ray emission in m82 imply the existence of gas with @xmath22k ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which in the cc85 model would be associated with a hot wind with terminal velocity of @xmath23 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the h@xmath16 filaments in m82 with velocity of @xmath24 km s@xmath13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are also proposed to be produced by rpa of cool clouds within the hot wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "numerical simulations have explored both the galaxy - scale ram pressure acceleration and production of cool clouds by a hot flow ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the survival of individual ( or a set of ) ram pressure accelerated clouds at high numerical resolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy - scale simulations of winds in general have coarse spatial resolution compared to what would be required to fully resolve conductive evaporation , magnetic draping , and the rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholz instabilities .",
    "most are also tuned to one particular system ( e.g. , m82 ) and prescribe an unrealistic uniform starburst ism as the starting condition ( although , see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , although the high - resolution simulations capture much of the very small - scale physics of the clouds and their evaporation or destruction , they generically do not vary the properties of the hot wind widely or explore the evolution of the wind properties with radius as the cloud is accelerated .",
    "they also do not ask about the global effects of gravity relative to the ram pressure force , or conduct parameter studies across a wide variety of cloud properties .    in this paper , we model the dynamics of cool clouds in hot winds , varying the parameters of the problem , and tracking the dynamics of the cloud itself , informed by the high - resolution simulations from the literature . we seek general constraints on the rpa scenario by comparing velocities , column densities , and temperatures with observations . in section [ sec_anal ]",
    "we first review the hot wind solutions of cc85 .",
    "we then present analytic constraints on various timescales of clouds in the hot flow , including their destruction by hydrodynamical instabilities ( in particular the kelvin - helmholtz instability ) , and the acceleration timescale .",
    "we highlight the fact that acceleration timescale of the cloud is always longer than the timescale for cloud hydrodynamical instabilities , and thus the hot flow can not accelerate cool clouds to its asymptotic velocity .",
    "we also compare the gravitational force with the ram pressure force , deriving a general eddington - like limit as a function of cloud and host galaxy properties , which strongly constraints the initial column densities of accelerated clouds . in section [ sec_num ]",
    "we calculate cloud acceleration numerically in a spherically - symmetric model , parameterizing destruction processes and following the evolution of the cloud as it is accelerated , and as the hot wind ( its density , temperature and mach number ) evolves as a function of radius .",
    "note that a complicating factor is that the cloud destruction timescale by instabilities remains uncertain , and is a function of both the radiative properties of the cloud and its magnetization as it is crushed and accelerated by the hot flow .",
    "recent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of isothermal clouds suggest much longer cloud lifetimes than indicated by pure hydrodynamical simulations @xcite . for this reason , in section [ sec_num ] we also provide additional discussion of cloud dynamics when the kh timescale is taken as a free parameter , and we derive the critical value of this timescale such that clouds are accelerated to high velocities as a guide for future simulations and comparing with observations . in section [ sec_cases ]",
    "we combine the x - ray model in @xcite with the rpa model for case studies of individual systems .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "we also discuss the impacts of other model parameters and other possible wind driving mechanisms .",
    "we briefly summarize the cc85 model in this section . for more details see @xcite . inside the radius of the starburst region @xmath25 the total energy and mass input into the hot wind",
    "are @xmath26 and @xmath4 and the volumetric energy and mass input rates are assumed to be constant .",

    "the dynamical timescale of the hot wind at radius @xmath46 is @xmath47 the cooling timescale is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the total energy of the flow , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the electron and hydrogen density in the hot flow , and @xmath52 is the emissivity of the flow . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the criterion for an adiabatic hot wind flow is @xmath53 at @xmath32 , which implies an upper limit on @xmath6 of @xmath54 where sfr@xmath55=sfr@xmath56 yr@xmath13 , and the bremsstrahlung emission @xmath57 is used to estimate the lower limit for the cooling rate @xmath52 , where @xmath52 is calculated by the full spex package , assuming collisional ionization equilibrium and solar abundance ( version 2.03.03 , see @xcite , also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the mass loading efficiency can not be higher than given by equation ( [ constraintcooling ] ) at @xmath32 or the system becomes radiative and the adiabatic solution for @xmath27 given by cc85 is invalidated ( see @xcite ) .",
    "properties of cc85 wind solutions +    .here @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the the starting position of the cloud . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xcite showed that for an axisymmetric disklike starburst , there is a spherical starburst cc85 model with an equivalent radius @xmath60 that can provide a good approximation in describing the hot wind solution in a disk - like starburst .",
    "the equivalent radius @xmath60 in general is smaller than the radius of the star forming disk region @xmath61 . in the following sections we first take a fiducial value of @xmath62pc as the equivalent radius of galaxies for simplicity .",
    "different radii are explored below .",
    "it is believed that the pressure of the hot wind fluid will entrain cool gas clouds from the ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in general",
    ", we expect the ism of rapidly star - forming galaxies to be highly turbulent , with a broad lognormal distribution of densities and column densities and with a multi - phase medium . in order to explore constraints on the survival and dynamics of clouds ,",
    "we first need to specify their properties .",
    "there are several parameters in our model for clouds : the temperature in the cloud @xmath63 , the initial density and column density of the cloud @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the starting position ( launching radius ) of the cloud @xmath59 . for simplicity , in our analytic estimates below and in section [ sec_num ] , we consider isothermal clouds with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , or @xmath68k as might be appropriate for molecular , neutral atomic , and ionized gas , respectively . also , we consider clouds initially at radii @xmath69 , and take @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in general",
    "the parameters are scaled in terms of fiducial values @xmath73k , @xmath74 @xmath75 , and @xmath76 @xmath77 .    given these sets of parameters for the cool clouds",
    ", we now estimate the timecales that describe their dynamics and survival in a hot cc85-like flow , including the timescales for cloud crushing , expansion , acceleration , evaporation , and hydrodynamical instability ( e.g. , the kelvin - helmholz and rayleigh - taylor timescales ) . the pressure in the cloud is @xmath78 the pressure in the hot wind is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the thermal pressure @xmath81 , and and the ram pressure of the hot wind @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 where the dimensionless velocity @xmath84 , density @xmath85 are functions of radius ( see table [ cc85solutions ] ) . here",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( see equations  [ windt ] , [ winddensity ] , [ vhot ] ) evaluated at @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "since the hot wind is supersonic ( mach number @xmath88 for @xmath27 ) , we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 . if @xmath91 , a shock will be driven into the cool clouds on a cloud crushing time when the hot wind overtakes the cool cloud , where the crushing time is defined as the time needed for the shock to cross the cloud : @xmath92 and the shock velocity @xmath93 is estimated as @xmath94 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , if @xmath95 , the cool gas can not be pressure confined by the hot wind , and it will expand at its sound speed until the cloud reaches pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium .",
    "thus , the expansion timescale for pressure equilibrium is @xmath96    the initial acceleration timescale of the cloud , i.e. , the time for the cloud to become comoving with the hot wind flow is of order is also called the drag timescale @xmath97 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "strictly , cool clouds can never reach the velocity of the hot wind , since the ram pressure on clouds decreases to zero while @xmath98 .",
    "the acceleration of a cloud is @xmath99 , thus the acceleration timescale is estimated by @xmath100 which diverges if we integrate @xmath101 from 0 to @xmath38 .",
    "analytically we estimate the cool cloud velocity @xmath101 to change from 0 to @xmath102 at a same position @xmath46 , which yields equation ( [ tacc ] ) for the time for the cloud to reach half of @xmath38 , and we say @xmath103 in this case .",
    "[ footnote1 ] ] @xmath104 comparing equations ( [ cctime ] ) and ( [ acctime1 ] ) , we have that for @xmath105 the crushing time is less than the acceleration time @xmath106 with @xmath91 . similarly , by comparing equations ( [ expantime ] ) and ( [ acctime1 ] ) , we find that for @xmath107 @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "note that we have treated the cloud as isothermal , because the shocked gas inside the cloud quickly cools to @xmath2 k or below on a timescale of @xmath110 100yr , much shorter than the timescales we consider below ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we take the temperature of the cool cloud as a constant , but always include the @xmath63 scaling .        in figure [ fig_timeconstraint ]",
    "we show timescale constraints as a function of the mass loading efficiency @xmath6 and sfr for clouds with temperature @xmath1 k , taking the cloud starting position at @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ( left ) and @xmath113 ( right ) as examples .",
    "the solid lines show the critical values of @xmath6 for @xmath114 in the case of @xmath91 , or @xmath115 in the case of @xmath95 .",
    "over the regime plotted @xmath116 , so only @xmath114 is shown .",
    "the dark gray regions are radiative , excluded by equation ( [ constraintcooling ] ) . since the solid lines are always above the radiative cooling lines , for any hot flow with parameters in the non - radiative regime , the cool cloud will establish pressure equilibrium with the hot gas before being accelerated at @xmath111 with @xmath1 k. we find that this result is also valid for @xmath117 and @xmath2 k , and with varying @xmath59 from @xmath60 to @xmath72 .",
    "this means that in virtually all regimes of interest , clouds reach pressure equilibrium with the hot wind on a short timescale .",
    "we use this fact in the following analytical estimates .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines in figure [ fig_timeconstraint ] are discussed in section [ sec_gravity ] .      after pressure equilibrium with the hot flow , we can estimate whether cool clouds can be accelerated by ram pressure of the hot wind before being destroyed by hydrodynamical instabilities or thermal conduction and evaporation .",
    "we assume that after establishing pressure equilibrium at @xmath59 , the cloud maintains pressure balance with the hot flow as it is accelerated .",
    "although the pressure is strongest at the front of the cloud , and proportional to @xmath118 , @xcite showed that an oblique shock is formed at the extended cometary wind - cloud interface and that as a result the pressure equilibrium between the hot flow and the cool cloud is best described by @xmath119 . in our estimates",
    "below , we apply this scaling for @xmath120 and show how the mach number ( @xmath121 ) of cold - hot pressure equilibrium enters the key expressions . for cloud pressure equilibrium ,",
    "one finds higher pressures , smaller cloud radii , and more rapid destruction by hydrodynamical instabilities ( equation  [ khtime ] ) , leading to even smaller maximum cloud velocities ( equations  [ vckh ] and [ vcevap ] ) . ]",
    "simulations show that the shocked swept - up supershells in the central region of molecular disks quickly cool and fragment through kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) or rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which have comparable timescales ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the timescale for a cloud to be destroyed by the kh instability is ( @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath122 where @xmath123 for @xmath111 to @xmath72 ( table [ cc85solutions ] ) , @xmath124 is the size ( thickness ) of the cloud , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 are the radius , density , and column density of the cool cloud after pressure equilibrium .",
    "the dimensionless factor @xmath128 has a value of @xmath129 when cooling is efficient inside the cloud ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hereafter we define @xmath130 , and @xmath111 to @xmath72 as the fiducial model . comparing the two timescales @xmath131 and @xmath132 in the case of pressure equilibrium",
    ", we find that if @xmath133 then @xmath134 , and the cloud should be shredded before acceleration to @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath135 for @xmath111 to @xmath72 . since @xmath11 is required for hot winds from the x - ray constraints presented in @xcite , equation ( [ constraintkh ] )",
    "is a strong constraint .",
    "it implies that @xmath131 is essentially always longer than @xmath132 for @xmath136 .",
    "more discussion of larger @xmath137 and its implications for our results is given in section [ sec_kappa ] . in the @xmath138sfr plane shown in the two panels of figure",
    "[ fig_timeconstraint ] , equation ( [ constraintkh ] ) is a horizontal line off the top of both plots ; for the fiducial model , @xmath131 is always much smaller than @xmath132 .",
    "we can then estimate the maximum velocity @xmath101 , and the  flying distance \" @xmath139 of the cloud , i.e. , the distance between the cloud starting position @xmath59 to its destruction position @xmath140 , accelerated in a timescale of @xmath131 respectively .",
    "if the cloud is destroyed by the kh instability , we have @xmath141 @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the acceleration of the cloud .",
    "note that @xmath144 is only a function of @xmath137 and @xmath63 , and is always below @xmath145 km s@xmath13 for the fiducial model . for @xmath111 @xmath146 with @xmath62 pc",
    "we have @xmath147 , as long as @xmath139 can be ignored compared with @xmath60 .",
    "these results show that the cloud is destroyed very near its starting position with a low velocity @xmath144 , but with a strong dependence on @xmath137 . because @xmath148 in the cc85 model , the maximum velocity @xmath149 , thus the starting position of cloud is important , especially for large @xmath59 ( see section [ sec_fiducial ] ) .",
    "thermal conduction may also be important to evaporate the clouds . in the case of saturated evaporation ,",
    "the clouds evaporate on a time - scale ( @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath150 setting @xmath151 implies an upper limit on @xmath6 of @xmath152 the dimensionless factor @xmath153 rapidly decreases from 1.2 to @xmath154 from @xmath111 to @xmath72 .",
    "the constraint on @xmath6 given by equation ( [ constraintevap ] ) is always weaker than the constraint given in equation ( [ constraintkh ] ) for the kh instability unless @xmath155 @xmath75 @xmath156 . in section [ sec_gravity ]",
    "we combine a constraint on @xmath127 derived by comparing the gravitational and ram pressure forces on clouds , and show that equation ( [ constraintevap ] ) always holds for cool clouds accelerated outwards by adiabatic hot winds .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath137 is much larger than implied by high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations and hydrodynamical instabilities are strongly suppressed ( e.g. , by magnetic fields ) , then saturated evaporation may play an important role in destroying the cloud .",
    "the maximum velocity of the cloud if it is subject to only evaporation is @xmath157 and the distance traveled before destruction is @xmath158 note that @xmath159 only weakly depends on @xmath127 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , if saturated evaporation is important , the cloud can never be accelerated above @xmath160 km s@xmath13 , and @xmath161 is small .",

    "if we take an initial cloud to be compressed by the ram pressure of the hot wind and come into pressure equilibrium with the hot wind , we show that the initial column density of launched clouds must be less than @xmath330@xmath75 for outward acceleration with @xmath1 k and @xmath62 pc ( equations  [ nhconstraint1 ] , [ nhconstraint2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_nhconstraint ] ) .",
    "higher @xmath63 or @xmath60 can increase the upper bound to @xmath331 @xmath75 .",
    "\\(4 ) the timescale for kh instability @xmath131 plays the most important role in determining the final velocities of clouds @xmath101 . for @xmath332k , as might be appropriate for absorption studies of the na d lines which have been widely observed in surveys of galactic outflows , @xmath101 is limited to @xmath333 km s@xmath13 by the kh instability ( equation  [ vckh ] ; figs .",
    "[ fig_vc ] and [ fig_vccontour ] ) , and the clouds are accelerated and destroyed very near their starting positions @xmath59 ( equation  [ flyingdistkh ] ) , potentially in conflict with observations .",
    "similarly , warm clouds ( @xmath334 k ) and molecular clouds ( @xmath335 k ) can not be accelerated by hot flows to observed velocities over virtually any range in parameter space . however , as we show in section [ sec_kappa ] ( fig .",

    "as expected from our analytic investigation , this picture fails to produce velocities high enough to match observations , expect for some dwarf starbursts ( e.g. , ngc 1569 ) .",

    "entrainment and ram pressure acceleration by a hot wind are strongly constrained .",
    "clouds in only a narrow range of initial column densities can be accelerated , and are shredded rapidly by the kh instability at small distances from their launch radii and at relatively low velocities .",
    "this calls into question the prevailing picture where the gas probed by absorption and emission is thought to be entrained and ram pressure accelerated by the hot wind .",
    "cool clouds can be accelerated to the observed velocities only if magnetic fields in the clouds are sufficiently important to prolong the kh timescale and suppress the evaporation , but even in this case the spatial extend and acceleration profile should be tested against observations of resolved systems like m82 ( section [ sec_m82 ] ) .",

    "<S> efficient thermalization of overlapping supernovae within star - forming galaxies may produce a supernova - heated fluid that drives galactic winds . for fiducial assumptions about the timescale for kelvin - helmholz ( kh ) instabilities from high - resolution simulations ( which neglect magnetic fields ) </S>",
    "<S> we show that cool clouds with temperature from @xmath0 k seen in emission and absorption in galactic winds can not be accelerated to observed velocities by the ram pressure of a hot wind . taking into account both the radial structure of the hot flow and gravity , </S>",
    "<S> we show that this conclusion holds over a wide range of galaxy , cloud , and hot wind properties . </S>",
    "<S> this finding calls into question the prevailing picture whereby the cool atomic gas seen in galactic winds is entrained and accelerated by the hot flow . given these difficulties with ram pressure acceleration , we discuss alternative models for the origin of high velocity cool gas outflows . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is that magnetic fields in cool clouds are sufficiently important that they prolong the cloud s life . for @xmath1k and @xmath2k clouds , </S>",
    "<S> we show that if conductive evaporation can be neglected , the kh timescale must be @xmath3 and 3 times longer , respectively , than the values from hydrodynamical simulations in order for cool cloud velocities to reach those seen in observations .    </S>",
