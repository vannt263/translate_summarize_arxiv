    "recently properties of systems far from equilibrium have been studied by many people .",
    "although mean field techniques may give qualitatively correct results for higher dimensions , for low - dimensional systems fluctuations have important roles .",
    "different methods have been used to study reaction - diffusion models , including analytical and approximational methods . among them",
    ", there are methods to obtain some quantities can be obtained exactly .",
    "for example in @xcite , imposing some constraints on the reaction rates leads to a closed set of equations for average number densities in each site .",
    "the empty interval method , is another method , which has been also used to analyze the one dimensional dynamics of diffusion - limited coalescence @xcite .",
    "the most general one - dimensional reaction - diffusion model with nearest - neighbor interactions that can be solved exactly through empty interval method , has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "empty interval method has been also generalized in @xcite .",
    "different methods has been introduced to calculate different quantities exactly .",
    "however , exactly solvable models are only a special class of reaction - diffusion models , and so people are motivated to use also approximate methods to understand the role played by fluctuations . in @xcite",
    "a two species model has been considered . in this model",
    "there are three competing reactions @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "asymptotic density decay rates of the two type of species for a special choice of parameters have been studied using the smoluchowski approximation and also field theoretic renormalization group techniques . a similar model focusing on the same diffusion rates for the two type of species has been studied in @xcite .",
    "field theoretic renormalization group analysis suggest that contrary to the ordinary mean - field technique , the large time density of the minority species decays at the same rate as the majority ones in one - dimensional case .",
    "although ordinary mean - field technique , generally do not give correct results for low - dimensional systems , its generalizations such as cluster mean - field may give correct results .",
    "any how , in the mean field approximation at most one - point functions may be obtained . to obtain more - point functions one should use other methods .",
    "one possible way is , to use a generalization of mean field known as the cluster mean field approximation .",
    "one of the topics , which have absorbed many interests in recent years , is non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "there are examples , in which mean field ( mf ) solutions are not valid , but its generalization , cluster mean field ( cmf ) gives qualitatively correct results @xcite .",
    "a coagulation - production model is recently considered in @xcite .",
    "although mf equations do not give correct results , cmf approximation predicts phase transition , supported also by monte carlo simulations .",
    "steady state properties in the absorbing phase of 1*d * pair contact process model are also investigated using monte carlo simulations and the cluster approximation .",
    "the cluster approximation qualitatively confirms the numerical results @xcite .",
    "the scheme of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the mean field equations for general parameters have been solved exactly .",
    "it is seen that , the large time behavior of the average densities depend both on initial average densities and reaction rates , and are independent of diffusion rates . in section 3 ,",
    "the cluster mean field equations for one- and two - point functions have been solved numerically .",
    "it is shown that the general large time behavior is determined by the diffusion rates .",
    "the model addressed in this article is a two - species exclusion reaction - diffusion model .",
    "that is , each site is a vacancy ( @xmath7 ) or at most occupied by a particle @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the interaction is between nearest sites , and the adjacent sites interact according to the following interactions with the indicated rates .",
    "@xmath10 we consider translationally invariant initial conditions . in the mean - field approximation",
    ", diffusion rates do not have any effect on the evolution equations of average number densities .",
    "the mean - field equations for the average densities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are @xmath13 the large time behaviors of these equations for special choices of parameters have been studied in @xcite .",
    "now , we want to solve these equations exactly and then we will show that there are cases which are not considered in @xcite , and give qualitatively correct result for large time behaviors , although the exponent of the decay rate is not correct .    consider the following cases .",

    ", it is seen that @xmath17 which can be integrated to @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the initial values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "now we can obtain the large time behavior of the average densities .",
    "it is seen that the large time behavior of @xmath21 depends on the ratio @xmath23 .",
    "0.5 cm i.1 ) @xmath24    at large times , obviously @xmath25 , so it is seen from ( [ 5 ] ) that depending on the initial value @xmath19 , two case may occur    at large times @xmath26    at large times @xmath27    assuming an imbalance in the initial average densities , for example @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , ( [ 2 ] ) gives the large time behavior of @xmath30 , and @xmath31 as @xmath32 which means that for @xmath24 , in the mean - field approximation the minority species dies out earlier than the majority one , and the decay exponent of @xmath31 is independent of diffusion rates .",
    "0.5 cm    i.2 ) @xmath33    as a consequence of the large time behavior of @xmath22 , @xmath34 , it is seen from ( [ 5 ] ) , that at large times @xmath35 . defining @xmath36 , @xmath37 to obtain the large time behavior of @xmath22 and @xmath21 , we should use again ( [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] ) , which give @xmath38 which means that at large times both the minority and the majority species decay with the same rate .",
    "the exponent of decay rate does not depend on the diffusion rates .",

    "for this case one arrives at @xmath40u\\over ( \\lambda + \\delta u)a},\\ ] ] which after integration gives , @xmath41 now , it is easy to obtain large time behavior of the average densities . generally , there are three cases , 0.5 cm ii.1 ) @xmath42    depending on the initial average densities , the large time behavior of the average densities ratio is @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) or @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , which means that one kind of species decays faster",

    "the average densities ratio @xmath43 , and @xmath51 .    0.5 cm as it is seen , in the mf approximation only for a special choice of parameters , which is independent of diffusion rates , the two types of species decay with the same rate .",
    "the case with @xmath52 , and @xmath53 has been considered in @xcite .",
    "using field theoretic renormalization group analysis , it is shown that in one - dimension both type of species decay with the same rate .",
    "monte carlo data also supports the field theory predictions in the one - dimensional model .",
    "now , we want to use cluster mean - field approximation .",
    "if the diffusion rate for both type of species is the same , @xmath54 cluster mean - field approximation gives the same value for the decay rates for both type of species , even if there is an imbalance in the initial average densities .",
    "if two type of species diffuse with different rates , irrespective of the initial values , at large times particles with greater diffusion rates decay more rapidly . for the nearest - neighbor interactions , the evolution equation of @xmath55-point functions @xmath56",
    "contains at most @xmath57-point functions .",
    "so , generally this set of equations will be a hierarchy , which can not be solved exactly .",
    "one way to overcome this difficulty is to impose constraints on the reaction rates that leads to disappearance of @xmath57-point functions from the evolution equation of @xmath55-point functions .",
    "this method has been used to calculate some correlators exactly in @xcite .",
    "another possible way is to use the cluster approximation . in the @xmath55-site cluster approximation , the set of evolution equations truncates and one encounters with a closed set of equations which may be solvable , at least numerically .",
    "any how , for a two - site cluster approximation , a three site joint probability for a sequence of nearest - neighbor sites is approximated by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the conditional probability . in the mean - field approximation",
    "there are three variables , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , only two of them are generally independent . in the two - site cluster approximation , or pair approximation , the variables are @xmath63 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , among them there are six independent variables which we choose to be @xmath68 , @xmath61 , @xmath69,@xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "in fact in the pair approximation , besides the average densities the two - point functions can also be obtained .",
    "the equation of motion for the average densities when @xmath73 are @xmath74 similar to the mean - field approximation , the diffusion rates do not appear in the evolution equations of the average densities .",
    "but in fact they affect the average densities through the evolution equations of two - point functions , which are , @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 to solve these equations in the cluster approximation , one should first approximate three - point functions and then all the equations should be expressed in terms of independent variables .",
    "for example @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80 and then using probability conservation @xmath65 should be expanded , @xmath81      figure 1 and 2 show results for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the density ratios @xmath82 obtained using numerical solutions of equations ( [ 12]-[16 ] ) . as it is seen both types of species decay with the same rate irrespective of equality or inequality of reaction rates @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in the mf approach",
    ", @xmath85is not an independent quantity and is @xmath86 .",
    "but in the cmf approach it is an independent one and the numerical result obtained for it is plotted in figure 3 .",
    "as it is seen , in the cmf approximation it approaches a constant value at large times , means that both @xmath69 and @xmath72 decay with the same rate .",
    "equality of their decay rates is independent of equality or inequality of reaction rates @xmath83 and @xmath87 .",
    "as mf equations are independent of diffusion rates , their solutions remain unaltered .",
    "but in the pair approximation , only equations ( [ 13 ] ) remains unaltered .",
    "the diffusion rate @xmath89 in ( [ 14],[15 ] ) should be changed properly to @xmath90 or @xmath91 , and the equations ( [ 16],[17 ] ) become .",
    "these set of equations has been solved numerically , and the numerical results for the average densities has been plotted in figures 4 and 5 . as it is seen , at large times , species with greater diffusion rate dies out faster .",
    "if species with greater diffusion rate are majority initially , there is a cross over , as it is seen from figure 4 .",
    "the general behavior of the average densities ratio is independent of @xmath83 , @xmath87 , and @xmath94 , and the general form of large time behavior is determined by the diffusion rates .",
