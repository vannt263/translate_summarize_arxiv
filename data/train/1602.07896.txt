    "radiogalaxies are the subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) where jets are clearly detected at radio frequencies , which in turn are classified in type i and ii faranoff - riley ( fr ) galaxies .",
    "hotspots are usually detected at the jet termination region of fr  ii radiogalaxies .",
    "these bright radio synchrotron knots have a size @xmath0  kpc and are embedded in larger lobes of shocked plasma .",
    "the location of the hotspot is coincident with the downstream region of the jet reverse shock , where particles accelerated by the latter emit non - thermal radiation .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) is a well established mechanism to accelerate particles in astrophysical sources where shock waves are present ( bell 1978a , b ) .",
    "particles diffuse back and forth across the shock and gain energy in each crossing .",
    "therefore , long times are required to accelerate the most energetic cosmic rays unless the magnetic field around the shock is amplified .",
    "the amplified turbulent field scatters particles rapidly so that they cross the shock more frequently achieving a higher energy in the available time .",
    "the state - of - the - art of dsa in the hotspots of fr  ii radiogalaxies is a phenomenological picture where the acceleration process finishes when particles start to radiate their energy or when they can escape from the source , i.e. the energy gained is sufficient for the larmor radius to exceed the size of the acceleration region ( meisenheimer et al .",
    "1989 ) . assuming that the magnetic field persists over long distances downstream of the shock , the distribution of non - thermal emitting electrons",
    "is a broken power - law where the break frequency is determined by a competition between synchrotron losses and adiabatic expansion ( e.g. brunetti et al .",
    "we will see however that the magnetic field must be highly discrete to explain the very thin radio emission in the southern hotspot of the quasar 4c74.26 ( araudo et al . 2015 ) .    ) .",

    "the fr  ii radiogalaxy 4c74.26 is located at redshift @xmath1 ( @xmath20.5  gpc from earth )  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "one arcsecond represents @xmath6  kpc on the plane of the sky at @xmath1 . ] .",
    "this source is the largest known radio quasar , with a projected linear size of 1.1  mpc and it has a one - sided jet .",
    "two x - ray sources have been detected with the _ chandra _ satellite in the termination region of the south jet ( erlund et al .",
    "the brighest x - ray source is called the `` x - ray peak '' and has no counterpart at other frequencies . on the other hand , the southern x - ray source is coincident with a radio , ir and optical source ( erlund et al . 2010 ) . in the present contribution",
    "we focus on this multiwavelength hotspot and assume that this is the jet termination region .",
    "the hotspot x - ray specific luminosity is @xmath77.9@xmath8  erg  s@xmath3 at frequency @xmath9  hz ( 2  kev ) .",
    "the shape of this emission is arc - like with a characteristic size @xmath10 , and encloses a compact radio source , also arc - like and called the `` southern arc '' , as we show in figure  [ sketch ] ( left ) .",
    "compact radio emission from the southern arc was detected with the merlin high resolution interferometer at a frequency @xmath11  ghz with specific luminosity @xmath12 1.9@xmath1310@xmath14  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "this emission is located in a region of width @xmath15 on the plane of the sky .",
    "in addition , faint and diffuse radiation was detected at ir ( @xmath16 1.36@xmath1310@xmath17  hz ) and optical ( @xmath18 6.3@xmath1310@xmath17  hz ) bands , and located in a region of width @xmath19 . however , there is a linear structure in both bands that traces the brightest edge of the merlin radio emission , and seems to be cupped within it .",
    "the measured radio - to - ir spectral index is @xmath20 , typical of synchrotron radiation , and the steep spectrum between ir and optical indicates that the cut - off of the emission is at @xmath21 ( see fig .  13 in erlund et al .",
    "therefore , the southern arc x - ray emission is not synchrotron  mpc from the nucleus , absorption of the emission by photoionization is ruled - out ( see e.g. ryter et al .",
    "1996 ) . ] .      the x - ray emission from hotspots is usually explained as synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) or up - scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ( e.g. hardcastle et al .",
    "2004 , werner et al .",
    "2012 ) . in the case of the southern arc in 4c74.26 ,",
    "ssc is disfavoured because 1 ) there is an off - set between the peak of the x - ray and radio emission , and 2 ) the energy density of synchrotron photons is 8@xmath1310@xmath22  erg  @xmath23 , much smaller than the energy density of cmb photons @xmath246@xmath1310@xmath25  erg  @xmath23 ( erlund et al . 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , we consider that the x - ray emission from the southern arc is produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cmb radiation .",
    "cmb photons with energy @xmath267@xmath27  ev are scattered up to @xmath28  kev x - rays by electrons with lorentz factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the planck constant .",
    "unless the macroscopic lorentz factor of the jet is @xmath3110 , @xmath32-electrons are non - thermal and follow a power - law energy distribution @xmath33 , with @xmath34 .",
    "the x - ray specific luminosity can be written as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the ic cooling timescale and @xmath37 is the volume of the x - ray emitter . from the previous equation we estimate @xmath38 and therefore , the electron energy density required to explain @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 terminates at @xmath42 . the magnetic field in equipartition with non - thermal particles , i.e. @xmath43 , where @xmath44 takes into account the contribution of non - thermal protons , is @xmath45 note that @xmath46  mg if @xmath47 . however",
    ", the equipartition field is an upper limit , and the magnetic field in @xmath37 is not necessarily the same as that in the merlin emitter , as we will see in the next section .",
    "the synchrotron emission at @xmath48 is produced by electrons with @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the lorentz factor of electrons emitting synchrotron radiation at frequency @xmath51 in a magnetic field @xmath52 . in a similar way to @xmath39",
    ", we write @xmath53 , where @xmath547.5@xmath1310@xmath55 is the synchrotron cooling timescale and @xmath56 is the volume of the merlin emitter .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and we find that @xmath60 in fig .  [ losses ] ( right axis , dashed line ) we can see that @xmath61 corresponds to @xmath625@xmath1310@xmath63 .",
    "such a large ratio between emitting volumes is not implausible provided the magnetic field is inhomogeneous in the shock downstream region and the synchrotron emitter consists of features smaller than the merlin point spread function ( fwhm @xmath64 ) as seen in parts of the merlin data .",
    "( note that if @xmath37=@xmath56 , a very small magnetic field ( @xmath65 g ) would be needed to explain the observed fluxes . ) therefore , x - ray emission is produced in volume @xmath66 , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] , and the magnetic field in @xmath56 is much larger than the jet magnetic field of the order of @xmath67 g ( hardcastle & krause 2014 ) . as we will discuss in the following",
    ", this may be the result of magnetic field amplification .",
    "the synchrotron ( @xmath68 ) and ic ( @xmath69 ) cooling length of electrons with lorentz factor @xmath70 is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the velocity of the plasma downstream of the shock .",
    "the shock velocity is approximately the same as the jet velocity which we take to be @xmath73 ( steenbrugge & blundell , 2008 ) .",
    "we use @xmath74 as the shock compression ratio for a non - relativistic shock whose downstream thermal pressure is dominated by relativistic electrons , although @xmath75 may still apply if non - relativistic ions dominate the pressure downstream of the shock .",
    "our conclusions are not sensitive to the exact value of the shock compression ratio .",
    "the ic cooling lenght of x - ray emitting electrons is @xmath76  arcsec , much larger than @xmath77 , and therefore ic emission is not the mechanism that determines the size of the x - ray emitter .",
    "the synchrotron cooling length @xmath68 of @xmath32-electrons is also greater than @xmath77 , unless the magnetic field in the x - ray emitting region is @xmath78  @xmath67 g , greater than @xmath79 ( unless @xmath80  arcsec@xmath63 ) .",
    "however , such a large value of @xmath52 in @xmath37 would produce a synchrotron flux much greater than that detected by the very large array in the a - configuration ( erlund et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore , adiabatic expansion is probably the dominant cooling mechanism as the particles flow out of the hotspot .",
    "the cooling length of electrons emitting synchrotron radiation at frequency @xmath51 in a magnetic field @xmath52 is @xmath81 } \\sim 12 \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\rm ghz}\\right)^{-0.5 }   \\left(\\frac{b}{100\\,{\\rm \\mu g}}\\right)^{-1.5 } \\left(\\frac{v_{\\rm sh}}{c/3}\\right ) .",

    "[ losses ] ( left axis , solid lines ) we plot @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "optical and ir emission are almost co - spatial , with @xmath85 and indicating that these particles radiate most of their energy within @xmath86 , or synchrotron emission of electrons with @xmath87 in a region with a smaller magnetic field , outside the merlin emitter . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the synchrotron cooling length of merlin emitting electrons is @xmath88 .",
    "even worse , the real hotspot extent downstream of the shock is @xmath89 if the jet is lying at an angle @xmath90 with the line of sight . in particular , @xmath91 when the hotspot is modelled as a cylinder of width @xmath92 and diameter @xmath93 , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( see the right panel of fig .  [ sketch ] ) .",
    "in such a case , a very large magnetic field @xmath96  mg would be required to match @xmath97 .",
    "this value is greater than @xmath79 for a wide range of @xmath42- and @xmath37-values , suggesting that the downstream extent of the compact emission detected at @xmath48 is not the result of fast synchrotron cooling .",
    "we suggest that the merlin emission region is determined by magnetic field amplification , as we explain below .",
    "remarkable advances have been made in the last decade concerning dsa in the non- and ultra - relativistic regimes . in the former case ,",
    "the realisation that non resonant hybrid instabilities ( bell 2004 ) in supernova remnants are fast enough to amplify ( and maintain ) the magnetic field by orders of magnitude ( vink & laming 2003 ) and accelerate particles up to the knee ( @xmath98  ev ) of the cosmic ray spectrum , has shed light on the origin of galactic cosmic rays . in the ultra - relativistic case , however , theoretical studies show that weibel instabilities amplify the magnetic field on a short scale length , producing a rapid decay of the fluctuations and thereby inhibiting particle acceleration to ultra high energies ( sironi et al .",
    "2013 , reville & bell 2014 ) .",
    "the mildly relativistic regime has not been well studied ( see however brett et al .",
    "2013 ) .    in the present contribution",
    "we show a mildly relativistic ( @xmath99 ) case study where the synchrotron cooling can not determine the thickness of the radio emission detected with the high resolution intereferometer merlin .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the magnetic field in the southern arc in 4c  74.26 is amplified since @xmath100  @xmath67 g ( required to explain the observations ) is much larger than the expected value in the jet upstream of the termination shock ( e.g. hardcastle & krause 2014 ) .",
    "in addition to the thickness of the synchrotron emitter , the cut - off of the synchrotron spectrum can give us an extra piece of information about the magnetic field .",
    "the synchrotron turnover @xmath101 between @xmath102 and @xmath103 indicates that the maximum energy of non - thermal electrons is @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "the standard assumption is that @xmath106 is determined by a competition between shock acceleration and synchrotron cooling . by equating @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the acceleration timescale for the case of a parallel shock",
    ", we find that the electron diffusion coefficient @xmath109 is much larger than the bohm value @xmath110 : @xmath111 and independent of @xmath52 .",
    "such a large diffusion coefficient is allowed if @xmath52 is structured on a scale @xmath112 much smaller than the larmor radius of the electrons being accelerated , producing @xmath113 and @xmath114 in comparison the ion skin - depth is @xmath115  cm , where @xmath116 is the particle density downstream of the shock ( @xmath117 , where the @xmath118 is the jet density ) , and @xmath119 therefore , @xmath120 is required to satisfy the condition @xmath121 in the case that @xmath122 is constrained by synchrotron cooling .",
    "note however that @xmath123 . in araudo",
    "et al . ( 2016 , submitted ) we explore this condition in depth .",
    "in the case that the magnetic field is amplified by the weibel instability , small - scale turbulence ( @xmath124 ) scatters non - thermal electrons during dsa ( sironi et al .",
    "however , the hotspot magnetic field has to survive over distances @xmath20.2  kpc ( @xmath20.1@xmath125 ) downstream of the jet reverse shock , which are much larger than those predicted by numerical simulations .",
    "the same discrepancy was found in gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. medvedev et al . 2005 , peer & zhang , 2006 ) .",
    "chang et al . (",
    "2008 ) have shown that the magnetic field generated by weibel instabilities in ultra relativistic plasmas is maintained constant over a distance @xmath126 downstream of the shock , and then decays as @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the distance downstream of the shock .",
    "( see also lemoine 2015 for a similar study in the non - linear regime . )",
    "we model the radio to x - ray emission in the southern hotspot of the fr  ii radiogalaxy 4c74.26 .",
    "our study is based on three key features :    1 .",
    "the merlin emission region is too thin to be the result of fast synchrotron cooling .",
    "the radio to ir spectrum ( @xmath20 ) is too flat for the emitting volume to be determined by synchrotron cooling through this wavelength range .",
    "3 .   the turnover of the synchrotron spectrum at ir / optical frequencies requires @xmath129 for any reasonable shock velocity .",
    "these three features fit well in a scenario in which the merlin radio emission traces out the region where the magnetic field is amplified by plasma instabilities with small length scale .",
    "the magnetic field decays quickly behind the shock accounting for the maximum energy of accelerated electrons at @xmath130  tev .",
    "these electrons continue up - scattering cmb photons , thus producing ic x - ray emission downstream of the shock after the merlin radio emission has ceased .",
    "the magnetic field in equipartition with non - thermal electrons in the merlin emission region is @xmath2100  @xmath67 g and similar to the values obtained by other authors .",
    "an unrealistically large magnetic field @xmath131  mg would be needed to explain the compact radio emission in terms of synchrotron cooling . if @xmath100  @xmath67 g in the synchrotron emission region , the maximum energy of non - thermal electrons is @xmath2  tev , ( eq .  [ ec ] ) .",
    "if ions are accelerated as well , protons with energy @xmath2  tev diffuse also with @xmath129 and then the maximum proton energy at the termination shock of 4c74.26 is only @xmath132  tev instead of the @xmath132  eev indicated by the hillas parameter .",
