    "there continues to be extended activity trying to understand the structure of water .",
    "this activity arises naturally from the fact that water is essential to the existence of life on earth , it is a major component in human industry and welfare , and its properties have a profound impact on the atmosphere and climate that surrounds us .",
    "the demand for structural data stems from the need to try to understand water properties at the molecular level : these are determined by the forces of interaction between and within water molecules , but the search for a reliable force field that quantitatively reproduces all known water properties seems to remain as illusory as ever . which is not to say there has not been a huge amount of effort and progress in this field .",
    "broadly speaking , water force fields can be categorised into three main kinds .",
    "there are the qualitative force fields : these are often relatively simple in mathematical form and are designed to study a water - like fluid over a range of thermodynamic state points .",
    "examples of such force fields include , but are not by any means limited to , the st2 potential of rahman and stillinger , @xcite , the spc potential @xcite , the earlier versions of the tip series of potentials @xcite or the mw potential @xcite .",
    "the second set , also often of simpler mathematical form but not necessarily so , aim to give a better quantitative description of water structure and thermodynamic properties , at the expense of some ease of use in terms of the computational time needed to run them .",
    "examples of these potentials include the tip4p2005 potentials @xcite , and those potentials where quantum mechanical effects are calculated explicitly as part of the simulation , rather than as part of the empirical potential , @xcite .",
    "finally there are the _ ab initio _ methods where molecular dynamics is combined with density functional theory to attempt to capture the electronic interaction between water molecules .",
    "naturally these have to be run on much smaller systems than is possible with the simpler potentials , but the results appear to be dependent on the choice of density functional and are often found to be too structured and to have too slow dynamics compared to experiment and the empirical potentials.@xcite obviously the list of potentials and methods here is far from exhaustive and is not intended to be so : the point is there is very diverse range of potentials and methods available because none of them is completely satisfactory .    extracting reliable experimental information on the structure of water , via the site - site radial distribution functions , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , proves to be equally problematic , as highlighted in a recent review , @xcite . as documented in that work",
    "there have been numerous attempts at the x - ray scattering experiment on water with varying degrees of consensus on the different results , and the same is certainly true of the neutron scattering approach .",
    "however it does seem that independent approaches to this problem are converging to a common picture : compare , for example , the results from @xcite with those of @xcite , or the results of @xcite with those of @xcite .",
    "whilst these latest results are certainly not error free , it seems that , by comparing many different experiments , a measure of the true uncertainties in the extracted radial distribution functions is obtained .",
    "this of course all applies to ambient water .",
    "the situation for non - ambient water is far less complete and even today there are still only a handful of scattering experiments on liquid water which study the effect of changing temperature and pressure .",
    "see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "therefore in an attempt to correct this imbalance between ambient and non - ambient water , i show here a new analysis of some previous neutron scattering data on water in the temperature range 10 - 365k @xcite , now combined with new x - ray data over the same temperature range . at the same time",
    "the opportunity is taken to re - analyse some earlier neutron scattering data on ice ih at 220k @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the liquid at different temperatures with ice ih structure produces an intriguing story .",
    "x - ray scattering data for water at 295k , ambient pressure , were recorded on a panalytical x - ray diffractometer , using the white x - ray beam from a silver anode ( k@xmath6 wavelength = 0.5609 ) using a 2.5 mm silica glass thin walled capillary in transmission geometry .",
    "a focussing mirror was used to eliminate as much off - k@xmath6 radiation as possible .",
    "the sample temperature was controlled by means of a cryostream heater and cooler to control the temperature within 0.1k .",
    "temperature uniformity across the length of the capillary was not monitored but was expected to be not worse than @xmath72k .",
    "the scattering data were corrected for background , empty capillary scattering , attenuation , multiple scattering and compton scattering , and put on an absolute scale of electron units using the krogh - moe method @xcite .",
    "in addition , using diffraction data from silicon crystalline powder as a calibrant , a correction was developed to remove the off - energy scattering that arose from the significant bremsstrahlung radiation in the incident x - ray spectrum .",
    "finally the single atom scattering was subtracted from the diffraction data , which were then normalised to the same single atom scattering to give an x - ray interference differential scattering cross section ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , defined by :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the atomic fraction and @xmath10 is the atomic form factor for component @xmath11 , and the partial structure factor , @xmath12 between atom types @xmath11 and @xmath13 is defined as the fourier transform of the corresponding site - site radial distribution function , @xmath14 : @xmath15 with @xmath16 the atomic number density and @xmath17 the wave vector change in the scattering experiment .",
    "neutron scattering gives fundamentally the same information as the x - ray experiment , except that atomic form factors are replaced by numbers - neutron scattering lengths - one for each isotope .",
    "this means that heavy water has a completely different scattering profile compared to normal light water .",
    "this can be exploited by measuring heavy and light water , and mixtures thereof , to give direct information on the h - h and o - h correlations in the liquid . in the present instance , as well as the pure liquids , measurements were made on mixtures of 50 mole%  and 64 mole%  h@xmath18o in d@xmath18o , the latter sample being called `` null '' in the figures because the net coherent scattering length of hydrogen in this sample is close to zero .",
    "scattering data were corrected for background scattering , container ( made from tizr alloy ) scattering , attenuation , multiple scattering , inelastic scattering ( using the methods described in @xcite ) , and put on an absolute scale by comparison with the scattering from a known volume of vanadium , which has an almost incoherent scattering cross section for neutrons .",
    "the samples were mounted on a temperature controlled sample changer and heated or cooled by means of a circulating water bath .    the resulting interference differential scattering cross section ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) for neutrons is ( assuming all the corrections have been performed perfectly ) : @xmath19 where the angular brackets represent averages over the spin and isotope state of the respective nuclei .",
    "the neutron scattering data in this work were recorded as part of the commissioning experiments of the new nimrod diffractometer at isis which is designed for looking at intermediate range structure in liquids , complex fluids , and glasses @xcite .",
    "comparison of these datasets with those measured previously on the sandals diffractometer at isis , @xcite shows excellent agreement in general , though problems with inelastic scattering from light hydrogen appear to be more pronounced on nimrod due to the smaller ratio of scattered flight path to incident flight path compared to sandals .    for the ice data a different sampling protocol",
    "is required .",
    "the point is that if a container of water is simply frozen , the crystalline material will contain a very high degree of preferred orientation , making obtaining a reliable powder average from such material difficult .",
    "( the flat plate containers used in these experiments can not be easily rotated to reduce this effect . )",
    "one way to avoid this is to freeze the sample , then powder it manually before placing in the container .",
    "this eliminates the preferred orientation , but also means we have no absolute scale for the scattering data , which become dependent on an unknown ` packing fraction'. to circumvent both problems in the present case a series of samples of h@xmath18o , d@xmath18o and `` null '' ice were measured by repeated freezing and thawing cycles : this helped to obtain a reasonable powder average but may not have removed all the preferred orientation .",
    "empirical potential structure refinement ( epsr ) is a monte carlo computer simulation method to simulate distributions of atoms and molecules which are consistent with a set of radiation scattering data .",
    "the method has been described extensively in previous publications @xcite so will not be elaborated here , other than to say the method uses an existing molecular interaction potential , the reference potential , to create an initial distribution of molecules in the box .",
    "then a perturbation to this potential is derived from the difference between simulated and measured structure factors , to drive the simulated distributions as close as possible to the measured data .",
    "the reference potential used in the present work was a lennard - jones plus coulomb plus exponential repulsive potential of the form : @xmath20+\\dfrac{q_{\\alpha}q_{\\beta}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}r}+c_{\\alpha\\beta}\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\left(r_{\\alpha\\beta}-r\\right)\\right ) \\label{eq : refpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the well depth and hard - core distance for atom pair @xmath23 respectively , @xmath24 is the charge on atom type @xmath11 , @xmath25 is an additional pre - assigned minimum distance for atom pair @xmath23 , to compensate for any atomic overlaps caused by the empirical potential , and @xmath26 is a width parameter which controls the hardness of the repulsive potential.the coefficient @xmath27 adjusts automatically depending on whether atom pairs of type @xmath28 are found for @xmath29 . in all the simulations presented here , @xmath26 was set to 0.3    for the simulations of crystalline ice , an additional harmonic potential was introduced .",
    "it was applied to the centre of mass of each water molecule .",
    "the force constant used in this `` tethering '' potential was used to control how far away water molecules could drift from their ideal lattice sites , and so stop the the lattice from melting . increasing",
    "this force constant produced a more sharply defined lattice with smaller debye - waller factors and weaker diffuse scattering .",
    "apart from this additional tethering potential , the water molecules were free to rotate and move as in the liquid state .",
    "the parameters used in the reference potential in these simulations are given in table [ tab : refpotpars ] .",
    "note that a smaller value of @xmath30 is used for ice than for water because the tethering potential already prevents molecules approaching one another too closely , so the use of the lennard - jones potential to prevent atomic overlap is redundant .",
    "the minimum distances , used in both sets of simulations , are shown in table [ tab : minimumdistances ] .",
    "these minimum distances are introduced to help improve the overall fit to the scattering data , and to compensate for the action of the empirical potential at very short distances , but have no other significance .",
    ".reference potential parameters used in the epsr simulations of water and ice [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : sdfs ] ( a ) - ( c ) show the calculated spatial density functions for water at 365k ( a ) , water at 280k ( b ) and ice 1h ( c ) . the very marked difference in local order between liquid water , ( a ) and ( b ) , and crystalline ice",
    ", ( c ) , is apparent in these plots . in both cases the inner core of water neighbours appears to be very similar between water and ice , with a pronounced lobe of intensity opposite each hydrogen atom of the central molecule , and",
    "a broader , more continuous band of intensity underneath .",
    "the second shells however differ completely between the solid and liquid forms . in the crystalline form",
    "the second shell is essentially a mimic of the first shell , about twice as far out , but in the liquid the second shell merges with the first shell in some directions , but at lower temperatures ( 280k ) is in almost exact antiphase with the first shell .",
    "the second shell then partly collapses into the first shell as the temperature is raised to 365k , but note that the local order in the first shell barely changes in this temperature range .",
    "note that this collapse of the second shell occurs despite the decrease in density as the temperature is raised , table [ tab : simboxes ] .",
    "a similar pattern is observed when low temperature water is pressurised and when the density certainly does increase @xcite .",
    "hence the local order in the first shell around a water molecule in ice at 220k and in water near the boiling point remains virtually unchanged : all the changes occur in the second shell .",
    "in particular when going from ice to water , then subsequently heating the water , this second shell collapses from being a replica of the first shell in ice ih to being in antiphase with the first shell in the liquid and at higher temperatures .",
    "the results of the epsr analysis shown in this paper reveal aspects of the structure of water and ice that are not often alluded to . in particular we find that the _ local _ ( first neighbour ) order in water is mostly unaffected on heating the liquid from 280k to 365k , figs .",
    "[ fig : oootriplets],[fig : oohtriplets ] and [ fig : sdfs ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "instead it is the second , `` interstitial '' shell that readily collapses inwards on heating , implying increased bending of the hydrogen bonds between triplets of water molecules , although the effect is subtle , fig .",
    "[ fig : oootriplets ] .    in ice ,",
    "although disordered to some extent , the water molecule oxygen atoms lie on a well - defined tetrahedral lattice , fig .",
    "[ fig : icesimbox ] with no sign of the interstitial water molecules found in the liquid . on the other hand",
    "the water hydrogen atoms in ice are surprisingly disordered .",
    "in particular the o ...",
    "o - h triplet angle distribution is significantly broader in the region 0 - 60@xmath31 than in water . on the other hand in the region of 60 - 180@xmath31",
    "the same distribution in ice is much sharper than in water .",
    "it can be surmised that these differences arise from the different environments that a water molecule finds itself in in the two materials . in ice",
    "the neighbouring four water molecules are arranged rather regularly on a tetrahedral lattice : the hydrogen atoms of the central molecule are therefore as equally likely to bond to any one of these four molecules .",
    "they therefore find themselves in a state of equally `` divided loyalities '' with the neighbouring water molecules , making it difficult to form linear , and therefore presumably stronger , hydrogen bonds with any one neighbour . in the liquid however , if a linear bond does form , then it is likely there will less competition from the neighbouring water molecules , due to their more random arrangements , so helping to preserve the linearity .",
    "this idea would explain why the second peak in the o ... o - h distribution is sharper in ice compared to water : in ice any individual bond is likely to be less linear than in the liquid , but overall the bonding environment is more favourable , leading to a significantly larger hydrogen bonding energy for the structure as a whole .",
    "this discussion must also take account of the significant zero point energy effects that affect hydrogen bonding in water .",
    "the computer simulations given in @xcite show clearly how significant quantum zero point disorder affects both the structure and dynamics of water .",
    "this zero point disorder derives primarily from the way the proton is bound to the oxygen atom in a water molecule , influenced of course to some extent by the inter - molecular bonding .",
    "zero point disorder is by its very nature nearly temperature independent , and so is likely to significantly affect proton disorder in crystalline ice as well .    given that the distributions derived in this paper are arrived at by a process of measuring data from crystalline ice on a low - resolution liquids diffractometer , then subjecting them to a fairly extensive , but far from perfect , computer simulation regime , it is tempting to propose that the results shown here are simply artefacts of the way the data have been handled .",
    "however our view is that this attitude is too simplistic .",
    "the widths of the peaks , and hence the strength of correlations , in real space are determined by the decay of intensity with increasing @xmath17 in reciprocal space - the debye - waller factor .",
    "the low resolution of the diffractometer means that bragg peaks in reciprocal space can not be individually identified in the present data at large @xmath17 , so that only the envelope of those peaks can be determined .",
    "if significant broadening effects were imposed on the data due to the resolution of the diffractometer they would affect the liquid water results as much as they affect the ice results .",
    "moreover this resolution function @xmath32 built into the epsr simulations described here , which should at least partly ameliorate for the loss of resolution in the real space functions that would otherwise occur from lack of @xmath17-space resolution . although detailed reproduction of all the bragg intensities here is inexact , the gualitative trends in these intensities with increasing @xmath17 are reproduced correctly by the current epsr simulations .",
    "moreover a recent computer simulation of the transformation from amorphous to crystalline ice @xcite suggests a degree of disorder in ice ih not incompatible with the present estimate .",
    "there have also been extensive discussions on the degree of disorder in ice based on crystallographic information - see for example @xcite - and the present results are not inconsistent with those conclusions , although , because radial distribution functions for ice are rarely calculated or shown , it is difficult to make direct comparisons .",
    "another issue that is often raised when discussing ice is the bernal - fowler ice rules @xcite , which state that there should be one hydrogen atom between each pair of oxygen atoms in the lattice , either covalently bonded or hydrogen bonded to one of the oxygen atoms , at any one time , and that each oxygen must have two covalently bonded hydrogen atoms .",
    "this idealisation of the real lattice will be difficult to adhere to strictly since the bond angle between the two covalently bonded hydrogen atoms in ice is believed to be around 107@xmath31 @xcite , that is , less than the 109.47@xmath31 required for precise tetrahedral bonding .",
    "quantum zero point effects as discussed above will make this strict adherence even less likely in an instantaneous sense , though on averaging over the positions of the hydrogen atoms , the ice rules should still apply .",
    "the question then is : does the current epsr model of ice ih also adhere to the ice rules ?",
    "clearly the condition that each water molecule have two covalently bonded hydrogen atoms is satisfied , since that is the way the water molecules have been defined within the epsr framework . on the other hand the condition that there is only one hydrogen atom between each pair of oxygen atoms will be more difficult to enforce due to the significant hydrogen atom disorder already discussed .",
    "to ensure the likelihood of two hydrogen atoms occurring in the same o ... o bond was kept acceptably low , a minimum h ... h intermolecular distance of 1.7  has been imposed in the current epsr simulations , table [ tab : minimumdistances ] . in any case",
    "such contacts would occur only for short periods in practice due to the coulomb repulsion between the hydrogen atoms in this model .",
    "the foregoing has described some empirical potential structure refinement simulations of liquid water in the temperature range 280k to 365k , that is from near the freezing point to near the boiling point , and also of crystalline ice at 220k .",
    "the local , first shell structure in this temperature range is found to be remarkably resilient to the change of temperature , with a tetrahedral - like first shell , near linear o ... o - h hydrogen bonds , a o ... o ... o triplet angle distribution which changes only slowly with increasing temperature . on the other hand the second neighbour , interstitial",
    ", shell is quite sensitive to changes in temperature , collapsing inwards as the temperature increases , presumably due to subtle changes in the o ... o ... o and o ... o - h triplet distributions .",
    "these ideas are borne out in the epsr ice simulations where the complete absence of an interstitial shell is marked by o ... o ... o triplet angles centred entirely on the tetrahedral angle at 109.47@xmath31 .",
    "interestingly the o ... o - h distribution is markedly less linear in the crystal compared the liquid , probably because of the much more disordered arrangement of neighbouring water molecules in the liquid .",
    "the present results for the radial distribution functions of ice ih differ somewhat from those shown in a previous publication @xcite because in the present case the water molecules have been deliberately constrained to lie near their crystallographic positions , while previously they were free to roam throughout the simulation box . in that case",
    "the simulation model would probably demonstrate excessive diffuse scattering compared to what is measured @xcite due to the substantial oxygen disorder .",
    "an interesting exercise here would be to calculate the diffuse scattering from the present epsr model and see how it compares with the same experiments .",
    "the author is indebted to sam callear for assistance with the x - ray scattering experiments , to daniel bowron for assistance with the neutron scattering experiments , and to werner kuhs for information about earlier ice crystallography ."
