    "delta scuti stars are a variety of pulsating variable star located within the classical instability strip of the hr diagram ( rodriguez & breger 2001 ) .",
    "they inhabit the region between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and display periods ranging from 0.02 to 0.3 days .",
    "some belong to the high - amplitude @xmath1 scuti ( hads ) class , which display @xmath5 amplitudes in excess of 0.3 mag , and generally oscillate in radial modes , while the lower - amplitude members of the class have more complex frequency structure , typically showing numerous nonradial modes .",
    "altair ( @xmath0 aql ) is an a7 iv - v main sequence star ( johnson & morgan 1953 ) and is the 12th brightest star in the sky ( v = 0.755 , cousins 1984 ) . while it lies inside the instability strip , we are unaware of any reports of photometric variability .",
    "erspamer & north ( 2003 ) report @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and zakhozhaj ( 1979 , see also zakhozhaj & shaparenko 1996 ) derives a mass of @xmath8 and a radius of @xmath9 based on photometry .",
    "the hipparcos parallax for altair is @xmath10 , giving a distance of @xmath11 .",
    "combined with the observed v magnitude and the bolometric correction from flower ( 1996 ) gives @xmath12 .",
    "altair is a rapid rotator , with spectroscopically derived @xmath13 values in the literature ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( royer et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "altair is nearby enough to make direct measurement of its diameter possible .",
    "richichi et al . (",
    "2002 ) reported a diameter of @xmath16 , corresponding to a radius of @xmath17 .",
    "recent interferometric observations ( van belle et al .",
    "2001 ) have established that altair is oblate , with equatorial diameter of @xmath18 ( corresponding to a radius of @xmath19 ) and polar diameter of @xmath20 , for an axial ratio @xmath21 .",
    "van belle et al . also derive a value for @xmath13 of @xmath22 .",
    "altair s absolute v magnitude is + 2.22 ( based on the hipparcos distance ) and its @xmath23 ( hauck & mermilliod 1998 ; nekkel et al .",
    "1980 ) , which places it well inside the @xmath1 scuti instability strip ( breger 1990 ) .",
    "however , like many such objects , altair has never been detected to oscillate .",
    "it is as yet unclear whether these non - oscillating stars within the instability strip are truly non - oscillating , or whether the non - detections are instead due to either periods or amplitudes which are undetectable from the ground ; some indications are that slow rotation is a necessary condition for large oscillation amplitudes ( breger 1982 , solano & fernley 1997 , but for an alternate view see rasmussen et al .",
    "the wide - field infrared explorer ( wire ) mission was launched by nasa into a sun - synchronous orbit on 4 march 1999 .",
    "the primary mission failed several days after launch , but conversion of the spacecraft into an asteroseismology platform using the onboard star camera as the new science instrument began on 30 april 1999 .",
    "the star camera consists of a 52 mm , f/1.7 refractive optic feeding a @xmath24 site ccd and a 16-bit analog - to - digital converter .",
    "the camera has a field of view of roughly 7.8 degrees square , corresponding to an image scale of 1 arc minute per pixel ; it is unfiltered , but the effective response is roughly @xmath25 .",
    "observations of altair were carried out with a cadence of 0.5 seconds .",
    "details of the instrument and its performance can be found in buzasi ( 2000 , 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "altair was observed from 18 october through 12 november 1999 .",
    "exposures of 0.1 second were taken during about 40% of the spacecraft orbital period . some additional gaps due to mission operations constraints were also present , resulting in an overall duty cycle of approximately 27% .",
    "we have reduced the data using two independent techniques , which we now describe . in the first approach ,",
    "as described in buzasi ( 2000 ) , data reduction began by applying a simple aperture photometry algorithm , which simply involved summing the central @xmath26 pixel region of the @xmath27 pixel field of view .",
    "the background level , due primarily to scattered light from the bright earth , was estimated based on the four corner pixels of each image , and subtracted . a total of approximately 1.27 million data points were acquired during the observing window .",
    "following aperture photometry , a clipping algorithm was applied to the time series , resulting in the rejection of any points deviating more than @xmath28 from the mean flux , image centroid , or background level . in practice , at this point in the data reduction process , the rms noise in the signal is extremely large ( @xmath29  ppt ) due to incomplete subtraction of scattered light , so clipping in this way only removes truly deviant points . the majority of these are due to either data from the wrong 8x8 ccd `` window '' being returned , or to data acquired before the spacecraft pointing had settled during a particular orbital segment . after this stage , approximately 1.21 million data points remained .",
    "as noted in the previous paragraph , the crude scattered light removal discussed above is clearly inadequate .",
    "much of the difficulty inherent in the reduction of wire photometric data is in successfully characterizing and removing the scattered light signature ( buzasi 2000 ) .",
    "we phased the data at the satellite orbital period , binned the result in steps of phase @xmath30 , and fit and subtracted a spline to the result , which lowered the rms noise level by approximately an order of magnitude .",
    "for an example of this process , see retter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the resulting distribution of magnitudes is a gaussian with some outliers .",
    "we discarded 466 points that were more than @xmath31 from the mean , and then binned into @xmath32 intervals , discarding bins containing fewer than 20 points . to remove slow trends",
    ", we also fitted and subtracted a third - order polynomial .",
    "the final binned time series contained 9828 points .    in the second approach",
    "we first fit a 2d - gaussian profile to each @xmath27 image in order to examine changes in the central @xmath33 position of the stellar profile and to find out how the fwhm changes",
    ". the @xmath33 position of the main target is found to be extremely stable , ie . @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the center of of the @xmath27 window .",
    "the fwhm of the stellar profile is also very stable , @xmath37 pixels .    for each image we measured the stellar flux using aperture photometry .",
    "the sky level was determined by the average flux of the four pixels in the corners of the ccd image , and the aperture was centered on the @xmath33 position found from the gaussian 2d - fit .",
    "the aperture sizes were scaled with the fwhm of the fitted gaussian to ensure that approximately the same region of the psf profile is sampled . to ensure robustness , the sky background , the @xmath33 position , and",
    "the fwhm we used were the average of the preceding 20 and following 20 images , thus averaging over a full 20 seconds .",
    "we used eight different apertures with increasing radii , and found the lowest noise when applying an aperture with radius @xmath38 , corresponding to @xmath39 pixels .",
    "we binned the light curve into groups of @xmath40 data points , requiring that each @xmath33 position be within 0.1 pixels of the mean ; 3@xmath41 outliers were removed .",
    "we also required that the time interval between subsequent data points not exceed 10 seconds .",
    "the resulting light curve has 40088 data points .",
    "the original data points have a point to point noise of 0.73  ppt , while in the binned light curve the noise is 0.16  ppt .",
    "we note that after subtracting the detected oscillation modes ( cf . section 3 ) we detected a slight correlation with the fwhm and have removed this by fitting a second degree polynomial to the residual flux vs.  fwhm .",
    "the entire altair light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : lc_full ] , while figure  [ fig : lc ] zooms in on a portion . in the latter figure ,",
    "the fit is overlaid as a solid curve .",
    "figure  [ fig : amp ] shows the a portion of the amplitude spectrum for the light curve extracted as described in section 2 . in the left panel the oscillation signal around 16.0  c / day can be seen .",
    "the right panel shows the amplitude spectrum when the three detected modes are removed .",
    "note that in both data sets a slow drift has been observed corresponding to a peak in the amplitude spectrum at a period of 27.0 days and an amplitude of just 320  ppt . due to",
    "aliasing this will give rise to a group of peaks around @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the orbital frequency of wire , ie .",
    "15.00 c / day .",
    "this is just below the frequency of the three observed peaks in the amplitude spectrum and with comparable amplitudes .    after removing the oscillation signal from the light curves we measured the noise level in the amplitude spectrum . in the high frequency range ( 3060  c / day ) the buzasi ( 2000 )",
    "approach ( technique 1 ; gray curve ) gives a noise level of 10.5 ppm , while our new approach ( technique 2 ; black curve ) gives a noise level of 9.8 ppm . in the range 1517  c / day ( around the oscillation peaks )",
    "we find 26.6 and 21.0 ppm , respectively .",
    "thus , the noise levels are comparable at high frequencies but significantly lower for the second method at the lower frequencies . the apparently higher amplitude of the three oscillation modes ( see left panel of figure  [ fig : amp ] ) derived from technique 1 is due to this higher noise level .",
    "figure  [ fig : amp2 ] shows the amplitude spectrum of altair from the second reduction method .",
    "we identify seven modes in this spectrum .",
    "note that both reduction methods yield identical oscillation frequencies within the estimated uncertainties .",
    "table  [ tab : sn ] shows for each oscillation mode the frequency , amplitude , phase , and signal to noise ratio for the two different techniques .",
    "we used the software period98 ( sperl 1998 ) to determine the mode parameters .",
    "the phase corresponds to the heliocentric julian date @xmath44 and the phase @xmath45 is in units of @xmath46 , thus , the light curve fit shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] is represented by @xmath47   ) $ ] .",
    "we estimate amplitude errors to be of the order of @xmath48  ppm ; this is apparent from a comparison of the amplitude of @xmath49 in figure  [ fig : amp2 ] to that derived from period98 and shown in table  [ tab : sn ] .",

    "the accepted definition of a @xmath1  scuti star ( breger 1979 , rodrguez et al .",

    "sx  phe stars are similar to @xmath1  scuti in most respects , but show population ii characteristics combined with anomalously large masses and young ages , while @xmath53 bootis stars combine @xmath1  scuti - type oscillations with abundance anomalies in fe , c , n , o , and s. since altair shows neither abundance anomalies nor pop ii characteristics ( indeed , it lies towards the low - mass end of the instability strip ) , and has spectral type a7  iv - v and primary oscillation period 0.0634 days , we identify it as a @xmath1  scuti star . in the following",
    "we will compare the observed oscillation modes with a number of published models with parameters close to altair .",
    "however , we stress that these models do not take into account rotation , which will significantly change the structure of the star . in a future paper",
    "we will address the detailed modeling of altair .    using the basic pulsation relation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the pulsation period , @xmath56 the mean stellar density , and @xmath57 the pulsation constant , it is straightforward to derive a theoretical period - luminosity relation of the form ( breger & bregman 1975 ) @xmath58 where frequency @xmath59 is in @xmath60 .",
    "the pulsation constant @xmath57 varies depending on both stellar structural considerations and the specific mode in question , but for the radial fundamental mode @xmath61 for @xmath1  scuti stars ( breger 1979 ) . using our fundamental parameters for altair from section 1",
    ", we then predict the frequency of the fundamental mode to be @xmath62 , remarkably close to our observed @xmath63 .",
    "extensive linear and nonlinear analysis of @xmath1 scuti oscillation properties has been published ( see , _",

    "stellingwerf s models also predicted that the third overtone should also be visible , at a frequency between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "there is no conclusive evidence in our amplitude spectrum for such a mode , though the location of our @xmath76 is certainly suggestive .",

    ", these peaks must correspond to nonradial oscillation modes , but beyond that our identification is uncertain .",
    "the identifications of @xmath101 and @xmath76 are likewise uncertain , although we tentatively identify @xmath76 with the third radial overtone .",
    "more modern models of @xmath1 scuti stars , incorporating opal and op opacities , were explored by petersen & christensen dalsgaard ( 1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "updated versions of the stellar model sequences used in these papers were published online by petersen ( 1999 ) , and we compared our frequencies to these results .",
    "unfortunately , the metallicity of altair appears to be somewhat uncertain ; the value given in cayrel de stroebel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is actually that of @xmath0 aqr rather than @xmath0 aql .",

    "the effective temperature and bolometric magnitude of altair fall slightly below petersen s @xmath103 evolutionary track , a result which is in accord with erspamer & north s value of @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , petersen s figure 4 allows us to estimate the stellar mass based on @xmath104  the result once again is @xmath105 .",
    "our first harmonic , however , does not fit well onto petersen s @xmath106 diagram . in particular , for our value of @xmath107 , all petersen s models with @xmath71 fall in the range @xmath108 , quite different from our measured value of 0.759 .",
    "we suspect that this difference is due to the fact that petersen s models were calculated in the absence of rotation , while altair is an extremely rapid rotator .",
    "we can estimate the frequency shift due to rotation by using saio s ( 1981 ) polytropic models ( see also perez hernandez et al .",
    "1995 for a similar application ) .",
    "we take the frequency shift to be @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the frequency of the mode with radial order @xmath111 , degree @xmath112 , and azimuthal order @xmath113 , @xmath114 is the frequency of the same mode in a non - rotating star , @xmath115 is the stellar rotational frequency ( rigid body rotation is assumed ) , and the coefficients @xmath116 and @xmath117 are structural coefficients . here",
    "@xmath118 and the the @xmath119 are estimated by interpolation from the values in saio ( 1981 ) .",
    "the result indicates frequency shifts in the direction of lower frequencies , on the order of a few percent for the fundamental mode and nearly 10% for the first harmonic .",
    "in addition , the prescription of saio does not take into account departures from rigid body rotation that likely occur for extremely high rotation rates ( in this case , for example , @xmath120 ) .",
    "it is thus unsurprising that the period ratios from petersen do not correspond well to our measured values ; perhaps the larger surprise is that the period of the fundamental mode seems to fit so well ! we note without comment that assuming @xmath121 and fitting to petersen s evolutionary tracks in the @xmath122 domain yields an age for altair of @xmath123 myr , which in turn is in accord with the a7  iv - v spectral type generally assigned to altair .",
    "we have determined that the bright a7  iv - v star altair is an oscillating variable of the @xmath1 scuti type , and that its three most significant oscillation frequencies correspond well to the fundamental radial mode and its first two overtones .",
    "four additional frequencies are present at lower amplitudes , and these may represent nonradial modes .",
    "our result suggests that oscillation may in fact be present in many putatively `` non - oscillating '' stars in the instability strip .      1 .",
    "as suggested by the theoretical p - l relation of breger & bregman ( 1975 ) , the highest - amplitude mode is the radial fundamental mode .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation , 0.5  ppt , is several times smaller than is typically detected in non - hads @xmath1 scuti stars from ground - based observations .",
    "the first and second overtones are also apparent .",
    "it has been suggested that ( breger 1982 ) that slow rotation is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the development of large - amplitude oscillations in @xmath1 scuti stars .",
    "our result supports this contention .",
    "a number of authors ( see , _ e.g. _ rasmussen et al . 2002 and references therein ) have tried to understand the excitation mechanism in @xmath1  scuti stars by searching for systematic differences between variable and non - variable stars .",
    "our result suggests that such searches may be complicated by the fact that `` non - variable '' stars may in fact be variable at levels undetectable from the ground .",
    "in fact , the division between `` variable '' and `` non - variable '' stars in the instability strip may truly be an observational ( detection technology - limited ) one , with the objects in question occupying a broad continuum of photometric amplitudes .",
    "non - rotating models should not be expected to yield accurate representations of oscillation frequencies or ratios in rapidly rotating @xmath1 scuti stars .",
    "there is a significant need for calculations of oscillation frequencies that incorporate the effects of rotation .",
