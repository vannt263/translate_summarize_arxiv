    "in medical research , continuous biomarkers have been commonly explored as diagnostic tools to distinguish subjects , such as diseased and non - diseased groups @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of a diagnostic test is usually evaluated through sensitivity and specificity , or the probabilities of true positive and true negative for any given cut - point .",
    "particularly , the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve is defined as sensitivity versus @xmath0specificity over all possible cut - points for a given biomarker @xcite , which is a comprehensive plot that displays the influence of a biomarker as the cut - point varies . to summarize the overall information of an roc curve ,",
    "different summarizing indices have been proposed , including the youden index @xcite and the area under the roc curve ( auc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the youden index , defined as the maximum vertical distance between the roc curve and the @xmath1 line , is an indicator of how far the roc curve is from the uninformative test @xcite .",
    "normally , it ranges from @xmath2 to @xmath3 with @xmath2 for an uninformative test and @xmath3 for an ideal test .",
    "the youden index has been successfully applied in many clinical studies and served as an appropriate summary for the diagnostic accuracy of a single quantitative measurement ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been widely accepted by medical researchers that diagnosis based on one single biomarker may not provide sufficient accuracy @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is becoming more and more common that multiple biomarker tests are performed on each individual , and the corresponding measurements are combined into one single score to help clinicians make better diagnostic judgment . in literature",
    ", various statistical modeling strategies have been proposed to combine biomarkers in a linear fashion .",
    "for instance , su and liu @xcite derived the analytical results of optimal linear combination based on auc under multivariate normal assumption .",
    "pepe and thompson @xcite proposed to relax the distributional assumption and perform a grid search for the optimal linear combination , while its computation becomes expensive when the number of biomarkers gets large .",
    "recently , a number of alternatives were proposed to alleviate the computational burden . for instances , the min - max approach @xcite combines only the minimum and maximum values of biomarker measurements linearly ; the stepwise approach @xcite combines all biomarker measurements in a stepwise manner . by targeting directly on the optimal diagnostic accuracy , yin and",
    "tian @xcite extended these two methods to optimize the youden index and demonstrated their improved performance in a number of numerical examples .    in recent years",
    ", nonlinear methods have been popularly employed to combine multiple biomarkers in various fields , including genotype classification @xcite , medical diagnosis @xcite , and treatment selection @xcite . in this paper , a new model - free approach",
    "is proposed and formulated in a large margin classification framework , where the biomarkers are flexibly combined into one single diagnostic score so that the corresponding youdex index @xcite is maximized . specifically , the combination function is modeled non - parametrically in a flexible reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ; @xcite ) , where both linear and nonlinear combinations could be accommodated via a pre - specified kernel function .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we provides some preliminary background of combining multiple biomarkers based on the youden index . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the motivation for flexible combinations and formulate the proposed flexible approach in a framework of large margin classification for combining multiple biomarkers . in section 4 ,",
    "we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach . in section 5",
    ", we apply the proposed approach to a liver disorder study .",
    "section 6 contains some discussion .",
    "suppose that every subject has @xmath4 biomarker measurements @xmath5 with a probability density function @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a continuous measurement of the @xmath8-th biomarker .",
    "it also has a binary response variable @xmath9 indicating the subject is diseased or not . in literature ,",
    "researchers from different fields @xcite have discussed and explored the validity of combining @xmath4 biomarker measurements into one single score function @xmath10 as a more powerful diagnostic tool .",
    "a subject is diagnosed as diseased if the combined score @xmath10 is higher than a given cut - point @xmath11 , and non - diseased otherwise . to summarize its diagnostic accuracy ,",
    "the youden index is commonly used in practice . with sensitivity and specificity defined as @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ,",
    "the youden index is formulated as @xmath14 the youden index normally ranges from 0 to 1 , where @xmath15 corresponds to a perfect separation , and @xmath16 corresponds to a random guess .    to estimate the youden index ,",
    "various modeling strategies have been proposed .",
    "schisterman et al .",
    "@xcite provided a closed form for the youden index assuming the conditional distribution of @xmath17 follows a multivariate gaussian distribution . further relaxing the distributional assumption ,",
    "kernel smoothing techniques were adopted by yin and tian @xcite and fluss et al .",
    "@xcite , where the sensitivity and specificity were estimated in a nonparametric fashion .    note that the formulation of @xmath18 can be rewritten as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 otherwise .",
    "denote the ideal combination function @xmath26 and cut - point @xmath27 as the ones that maximize @xmath18 over all possible functionals and cut - points .",
    "following the proof of proposition 1 in @xcite , the ideal @xmath26 and @xmath27 must satisfy @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the conditional probability of disease given the biomarker measurements .",
    "in ( [ eqn : bayes ] ) , the ideal @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined based on @xmath30 that is often unavailable in practice . hence the expectation in ( [ eqn : youdenj ] ) needs to be estimated based on the given sample @xmath31 .",
    "specifically , a natural estimate @xmath32 can be obtained as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denotes the set cardinality .",
    "the optimization in ( [ eqn : youdenj_est ] ) is generally intractable without a specified candidate space of @xmath39 . in literature , linear functional space @xmath40",
    "is often used @xcite , mainly due to its convenient implementation and natural interpretation .",
    "yet there seems to be lack of scientific support for the use of linear combination of biomarkers .",
    "consider a toy example , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a 2-dimensional identity matrix . then for any given @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the ideal combination of biomarkers @xmath26 can take the linear form @xmath48 , leading to @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "however , if the biomarkers are heterocedastic in the positive and negative groups , the ideal combination would be no longer linear .",
    "for instance , when @xmath42 but @xmath51 , @xmath52 clearly , the ideal combination of biomarkers is a quadratic function @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , if the conditional distribution @xmath55 is unknown , then the ideal combination of biomarkers may take various forms , and thus a pre - specified assumption on linear combination can be too restrictive and lead to suboptimal combinations .      to allow more flexible @xmath56 than linear functions , it is natural to optimize ( [ eqn : youdenj_est ] ) over a bigger functional space consisting of nonlinear functions .",
    "note that the objective function in ( [ eqn : youdenj_est ] ) involves a @xmath57 operator , which makes it discontinuous in @xmath39 and thus difficult to optimize in general @xcite .",
    "alternatively , note that ( [ eqn : youdenj_est ] ) can be simplified as @xmath58 where @xmath59 . as proposed in xu et al .",
    "@xcite , a surrogate @xmath60-loss , defined as @xmath61 can be employed to replace the 0 - 1 loss @xmath62 in the objective function .",
    "the @xmath60-loss extends the @xmath63-loss @xcite by introducing a parameter @xmath64 that controls the difference between the surrogate loss and the 0 - 1 loss .",
    "figure [ fig : loss_function ] displays the 0 - 1 loss , the @xmath63-loss and the @xmath65-loss as functions of @xmath66 ."
