    "on january 29.16 the lincoln laboratory near - earth asteroid research project ( linear ) discovered a faint distant comet .",
    "the new comet was named c / linear ( 2004b1 ) . for shortness",
    ", we will refer to it c2004b1 .",
    "the orbit of the comet is slightly hyperbolic ( eccentricity = 1.001 ) , and its perihelion was on 2006 , feb 7.9 .",
    "we present images of the comet , obtained during a monitoring campaign lasting for 2 months , and point to correlations between morphological changes in the coma and variations of the total brightness",
    "we observed the comet on its outbound orbit , between 2.4 and 2.9 au heliocentric distance .",
    "our observing campaign started on june 21 , 2006 , and lasted until august , 20 .",
    "the observations were carried out with the schmidt telescope of the national astronomical observatory .",
    "the images were obtained in the r - band with a ccd camera st-8 .",
    "parameters of the camera can be seen in kostov et al .",
    "details for the observations are given in table 1 .",
    "visit http://www.astro.bas.bg/solsys/c2004b1/ to see all the images .",
    ".data for the observations [ cols=\"^,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the images were converted to surface brightness by using standard stars in the field . we used the r - magnitudes of these stars given in the usno ( united states naval observatory ) catalogue for photometric calibration .",
    "examples of surface brightness maps are shown in figure [ fig : maps ] .",
    "the 6 images shown are not a randomly selected sample .",
    "their purpose is to illustrate how the coma morphology changes with variations of the total comet magnitude .",
    "the maps in the middle panels are derived from the images obtained at the two instants of reduced brightness , described in the next section .    .",
    "note , in both rows the morphology of the coma in the middle panel is different compared to the left and right images ( see the text for more information ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the light curves of comet c2004b1 .",
    "they are compared to ephemeris calculated at two different epochs by horizons .",
    "the first one ( dotted line ) is from nov 8 , 2006 and is based on 1521 observations from the period 2004 - 2006 .",
    "this ephemeris gives also the brightness of the comet nucleus , shown with dashed - dotted line in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the second ephemeris data ( dashed - double dot line ) in the same figure , are from april 1 , 2007 , and are based on 1576 observations from the period 2004 - 2007 .",
    "five months after perihelion the brightness of comet c2004b1 was substantially reduced in comparison to the first ephemeris , but about one magnitude above the values from the second one . in most cases",
    "the total brightness of the comet was comparable with the predicted brightness of the bare nucleus given by the first ephemeris . in two cases , on july 7,8,9 and around aug 9 , the brightness of the comet dropped more than 1 magnitude below the mean level .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] ( right panel ) shows that the activity of the comet is almost independent on its heliocentric distance . in their taxonomic study of 85 comets",
    "ahearn et al .",
    "@xcite found cases in which the dust production is even increasing with heliocentric distance . according to these authors flat slopes",
    "are characteristic for dynamically new comets before their perihelion passage .",
    "we remind that comet c2004b1 was observed several months after its perihelion .",
    "the decreased total brightness of the comet at two occasions ( see figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) is accompanied by morphological changes in the coma .",
    "most remarkable is the faster decrease of the surface brightness in the outer coma , at distances @xmath0 10 .",
    "this is well seen in figure [ fig : mean_prof ] , where in the left panel the azimuthally averaged profiles of the images with reduced brightness are compared to those obtained several days before the brightness decrease and several days after that .",
    "the dotted line shows a @xmath1-profile , the ideal case of an isotropic and stationary outflow .",
    "the full line is a @xmath2 - law which fits well the data obtained during phases of normal activity .",
    "this steeper slope of the mean brightness profile is most probably due to the gradual increase of the velocity with increasing cometocentric distance , caused by the accumulated influence of the radiation pressure acceleration . in the right panel of the same figure",
    "the corresponding @xmath3 profiles are shown ( @xmath3 was introduced by ahearn et al .",
    "@xcite as a proxy for the dust production rate ) .",
    "comparison of the profile from july 8 ( drop of brightness ) with the profile from july 13 ( almost return to the total magnitude before the drop ) shows comparable levels of the mean surface brightness at distances @xmath4 10 .",
    "this is an indication that most of the brightness reduction is due to losses in the outer coma , rather than to reduced activity of the nucleus . in the august event",
    "the reduction is again stronger in the outer coma but now it is accompanied by decrease in the circumnuclear region . in this case both , reduction of the dust production from the nucleus and losses in the coma should be responsible for the total brightness decrease .",
    "the reduced brightness of the outer coma could be explained by sublimation of dust particles .",
    "recently , beer et al . @xcite have shown how sublimation of dirty icy grains can influence the particle size distribution in the coma and lead to a dominant role of large particles .    *",
    "do large dust grains dominate the coma of comet c2004b1 on its outbound orbit between 2.4 au and 2.9 au perihelion distance ?",
    "what are the reasons for the sudden drop of brightness ?",
    "answers to these questions could be given by comparison of our data with infrared observations *    _ acknowledgments : _ this work made extensive use of the jpl horizons on - line ephemeris system ( giorgini et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "the online usno - a2.0 catalogue server at the eso / st - ecf archive was used to extract data from the usno catalogue ."
