    "it is common to describe galaxies by a few key properties , such as luminosity , colour , size and ellipticity , which are ( at least in the local universe and at optical and near - infrared wavelengths ) indicative of the total mass , average age , and spatial extent of their stellar contents . at a slightly more detailed level",
    ", one may characterise a galaxy in terms of its internal structure , or morphology : the presence and relative strength of features such as disks , bulges , bars , rings and spiral arms .",
    "each of these features represents a distinctive distribution of stars , in terms of both their positions and velocities .",
    "unfortunately , resolved stellar velocities are difficult to obtain , particularly for large samples of distant galaxies .",
    "the largest studies of the internal structure of galaxies must therefore inevitably rely on imaging data .",
    "galaxies principally come in two morphological types : ellipticals and disk galaxies .",
    "ellipticals have a simple , smooth appearance , show old stellar populations and live preferably in denser environments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . spirals primarily comprise a thin disk , containing a spiral arm pattern ; possess younger stellar populations , and avoid dense regions ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , spirals often also contain a spheroidal ` bulge ' , a structure similar in colour and shape to a small elliptical galaxy , at their centre @xcite ; though bulges appear to be denser than present day elliptical galaxies , ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the relative size and importance of the bulge and the appearance of the spiral features vary substantially , resulting in a range of spiral morphologies @xcite .",
    "lenticular galaxies sit at the intersection of ellipticals and spirals .",
    "they display similarities to both , often being dominated by a bulge , but also by definition , containing a spiral - free , disk - like component .",
    "ellipticals and lenticulars can be hard to distinguish from their appearance .",
    "indeed , over the past decade many galaxies that were thought to be ellipticals have been discovered to contain rotating disks , and thus are actually lenticular galaxies .    from the latest models of galaxy formation and evolution ,",
    "it is becoming clear that there is a more fundamental distinction in the galaxy population than that between elliptical , lenticular , and spiral galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to truly understand galaxy evolution ,",
    "one must separate the components of galaxies : spheroids and disks .",
    "elliptical galaxies are dominated by a single spheroidal component , while most spiral and lenticular galaxies contain both a spheroid ( the bulge ) and a disk . the striking difference between galaxy types may primarily be a result of variation in the relative prominence of the spheroid and disk components .",
    "a common way of describing the structure of galaxies is through the srsicindex @xmath0 , which describes the radial concentration of the projected light distribution .",
    "the @xcite function is given by : @xmath4 \\right \\}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the effective radius ( that is , the radius containing half of the model light ) , @xmath5 is the intensity at the effective radius , @xmath0 is the srsicindex , and @xmath6 is a function of srsicindex and is such that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the complete and incomplete gamma functions , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this is the simplest function one could consider to model a galaxy profile , being the first - order taylor expansion of any real light profile .",
    "when @xmath0 is equal to the values @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( and @xmath6 assumes tha values of 0.676 , 1.676 and 7.676 , respectively ) , the srsicprofile is equivalent to a gaussian , exponential and de vaucouleurs profile , respectively .",
    "a srsicprojected profile implies a 3d luminosity density profile involving the fox @xmath13 function @xcite .",
    "elliptical galaxies are typically regarded as single - component structures , hence @xmath0 is a reasonably fundamental description of the profile ( but see @xcite and @xcite ) . however ,",
    "when fitting a single - srsicprofile to a disk galaxy the resulting @xmath0 reflects the contribution of both the disk and the bulge to the light distribution .",
    "we note that some degeneracy exists , in that appropriate small variations in re and n can produce similar surface brightness profiles , which are indistinguishable at the resolution and depth of the data we consider .",
    "the two quantities are also found to be correlated in the galaxy population .",
    "however , e.g. , @xcite showed that the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is definitely not explained by parameter coupling in the fitting process ; this trend between galaxy structure and size exists also when one uses model - independent values .",
    "indeed , it is a natural consequence from the relations existing between the model - independent parameters : total luminosity , effective radius and effective surface brightness .",
    "all galaxies show variations in colour to some degree .",
    "these often appear as radial colour gradients , with the centres of galaxies generally redder than their outer regions ( at least in the more luminous galaxy population ; @xcite ) .",
    "even the colour of elliptical galaxies varies significantly with radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "colour gradients provide important information for understanding how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "for example , steep gradients are expected when stars form during strongly - dissipative ( monolithic ) collapse in galaxy cores .",
    "in such a scenario , gas is retained by the deep potential well , with consequently extended star formation activity and greater chemical enrichment of the inner regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in early - type galaxies",
    "the main driver of colour gradients is probably metallicity ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , even though the contribution of the age ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and even dust ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) can not be ignored .",
    "structurally , ellipticals may appear to be single - component systems , but that component certainly does not possess a homogeneous stellar population .",
    "colour gradients are typically stronger in bulge - disk systems .",
    "bulges tend to contain older , redder stars of higher metallicity than those found in the disks of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "shorter optical wavelengths are more sensitive to the young , blue populations typically found in disks , whereas longer ( optical and near - infrared ) wavelengths increasingly trace the old stellar population of both components .",
    "most late - type galaxies therefore display a substantial colour gradient from red centres to blue outskirts , @xcite , though peculiar galaxies can show opposing trends @xcite .",
    "in addition to stellar population gradients , the dust content of a galaxy can produce colour gradients and influence the measured structural parameters in a wavelength dependent manner @xcite .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether dust attenuation or stellar population gradients are the dominant factor in determining how observed galaxy structure varies with wavelength .",
    "@xcite have shown how colour gradients may be used as a morphological classifier , while @xcite found that steeper colour gradients appear within star - forming galaxies , in both late and early - types .",
    "atypical gradients can be used to identify interesting populations .",
    "for example , @xcite , studying early - type galaxies drawn from the sdss dr6 , found a tight correlation between the existence of steep colour gradients and centrally - concentrated residual star formation .",
    "they suggest a relation such that elliptical galaxies with bluer cores present globally bluer colours than average . @xcite",
    "found the same relation for spheroidal galaxies observed by the hst at @xmath14 .",
    "most of the studies mentioned so far have focused on measuring radial colour gradients , rather than considering how their profile shapes depend on wavelength .",
    "however , variations in colour with radius directly imply that the light profile must change with wavelength , in terms of varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 . and @xmath1 .",
    "] in general , therefore , the values measured for @xmath0 and @xmath1 will depend on the observed wavelength .",
    "some works have started investigating the wavelength dependence of galaxy structure , fitting srsicmodels independently to images in different wavebands .",
    "@xcite presented for the first time a careful analysis of the structural parameters of low - redshift early - type galaxies as a function of wavelength .",
    "they showed that @xmath1 decreases by 35% from the optical to the near - infrared ( nir ) , reflecting the internal colour gradients in these systems .",
    "their srsicindices span a domain from @xmath15@xmath16 , with a median of @xmath17 for all wavebands .",
    "@xcite presented similar two - dimensional , single - srsicmodel fits to a large sample of low - redshift galaxies .",
    "they found that the mean srsicindex of early - types shows a smooth variation with wavelength , increasing by 30% from @xmath18 through @xmath19 , while the effective radius decreases by 38% across the same range . in contrast , late - types exhibit a more extreme change in srsicindex , increasing by 52% , but a more gentle variation in effective radius , decreasing by 25% .",
    "these trends are interpreted as due to the effects of dust attenuation and stellar population / metallicity gradients within galaxy populations .",
    "when fitting images at different wavelengths completely independently , statistical and systematic variations in the recovered centre , ellipticity , position angle , etc . will translate into noise in the recovered trends for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is particularly an issue if one wants estimates of the wavelength dependence of structure on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis . to address this ,",
    "some parameters may be fixed to fiducial values , while the parameters of interest are allowed to vary .",
    "however , it is not clear how to fairly determine such fiducial values .    in this paper",
    "we build upon the work of @xcite and @xcite , by fitting a single , wavelength - dependent model to all the data simultaneously .",
    "this is made possible using an extended version of galfit@xcite developed by the megamorph project ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h13 ) , @xcite and bamford et al . in prep .",
    "this approach maximises the signal - to - noise available to constrain the model and ensures that the parameters are optimal for the whole dataset .",
    "the greatest advantages of this approach are expected when decomposing galaxies with multiple components ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "making colour information available to the fit increases the robustness with which the components can be separated , and hence improves the accuracy and physical meaningfulness of their recovered parameters . however , to begin we have explored the performance of our technique in fitting single - component models",
    "h13 have tested the new method on large datasets , automating both the preparation of the data and the fitting process itself by extending the existing galapagos@xcite code .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , studied nearby galaxies and assessed our method by fitting artificially - redshifted versions of these galaxies .",
    "having at our disposal structural parameters obtained via a consistent multi - wavelength approach from megamorph , we can now study the wavelength dependence of srsicindex and effective radius for both individual galaxies and sample populations . in this paper",
    "we quantify these trends using the ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at two wavelengths .",
    "these ratios provide a simple but powerful parametric way of considering galaxy colour gradients , which reveal information about the prevalence of galaxies with different internal structures , and how this varies with other galaxy properties . at a more practical level , quantifying how @xmath0 and @xmath1 vary with wavelength is crucial for removing biases when comparing measurements made using different bandpasses or at different redshifts .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in   [ data ] we present the dataset used for the analysis and describe the properties of the sample we analysed . in   [ results ]",
    "we show our results for the wavelength dependence of srsicindices and effective radii , first by considering trends for subsamples of the galaxy population and then by quantifying the behaviour of individual galaxies . in   [ stacks ] we discuss the interpretation of our measurements and demonstrate how they relate to the visual appearance of galaxies . in   [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results in the context of previous work .",
    "finally , in  6 we summarise and present our conclusions .",
    "the analysis has been carried out using a cosmology with ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) = ( 0.3 , 0.7 , 0.7 ) and ab magnitudes .",
    "the sample of galaxies considered in this paper has been previously presented in h13 .",
    "a detailed description of the selection criteria , robustness of the fits and properties of our sample can be found in that paper ; here we give a brief overview .",
    "our sample is drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly survey ii ( gama ; @xcite ) , the largest homogeneous multi - wavelength dataset currently available , in terms of both spatial volume and wavelength coverage .",
    "gama is primarily a redshift survey , but it is supplemented by a highly consistent and complete set of multi - wavelength data , spanning from the far - uv to radio .",
    "the gama imaging data includes five - band optical ( @xmath23 ) imaging from sdss @xcite and four - band near - infrared ( @xmath24 ) imaging from the large area survey ( las ) component of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al .",
    "all of these bands have a depth and resolution amenable to srsic - profile fitting ( as demonstrated by @xcite ) .",
    "conveniently , the images for all nine bands have been ` micro - registered ' onto the same pixel grid ( using swarp , @xcite , as described in @xcite ) , and rescaled to a common zero point of @xmath25  mag , which are essential for our purposes .",
    "our sample is limited to galaxies in one region of gama , the equatorial field at 9h r.a .",
    "( known as _ g09 _ ) .",
    "the multi - wavelength imaging data provided by gama is analysed using a modified version of galapagos@xcite .",
    "this version ( galapagos-2 ) has been adapted for use on multi - wavelength , ground - based data , as described in detail in h13 .",
    "this software enables the automated measurement of wavelength - dependent srsicprofile parameters for very large samples of galaxies in a homogeneous and consistent manner . to fit each galaxy",
    ", galapagos-2 utilizes a recently - developed multi - wavelength version of galfit(which we refer to as galfitm ) .",
    "this extended version of galfitwas introduced in h13 and is described in detail in bamford et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "we refer the interested reader to this paper and h13 for further details and technical background reading .",
    "galfitmfits a single wavelength - dependent model to all the provided images simultaneously . rather than fit the parameter values at the wavelength of each band ,",
    "galfitmfits the coefficients of a smooth function describing the wavelength dependence of each parameter .",
    "specifically , galfitmemploys chebyshev polynomials , with a user - specifiable order for each parameter , which controls the desired smoothness of their wavelength dependence .",
    "for example , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 coordinates of the galaxy centre may be allowed to vary , but remain a constant function of wavelength .",
    "magnitudes could be allowed to vary completely freely , by setting a sufficiently high polynomial order .",
    "other parameters may be allowed to vary at a lower order , providing flexibility to obtain a good fit , while avoiding unjustified ( physically or by the data quality ) variability and reducing the dimensionality of the model .    in the fitting process for this paper ,",
    "we allow full freedom in magnitudes , while srsicindex and @xmath1 are allowed to vary with wavelength as second order polynomials .",
    "all other parameters ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 position , position angle and axis ratio ) are selected to be constant with wavelength .    amongst other data , galapagos-2 returns magnitudes ( @xmath28 ) , srsicindices ( @xmath0 ) and effective radii ( @xmath1 ) , calculated at the wavelength of each input image . to investigate the reliability of our size determinations ,",
    "we have compared our @xmath1 measurements to an alternative , less model - dependent , estimate of galaxy size . for convenience",
    "we use the standard half - light radius , @xmath29 , provided by sextractorduring the initial stages of galapagos .",
    "this is the radius containing half of the total flux within the kron aperture @xcite , obtained independently for each bandpass .",
    "figure [ cfr_rsize ] shows the comparison of these sizes in the @xmath30-band , for galaxies with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we see very similar relations in all other bands .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the two size estimates , but also obvious deviations from a one - to - one line .",
    "@xmath29 tends to @xmath15 pixels for small objects , due to the effect of the psf and pixelisation .",
    "both of these are accounted for by the srsicfit , and hence @xmath1 suffers less bias at small sizes . for larger galaxies , @xmath29 is consistently smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "this is a result of kron apertures missing flux in the outer regions of galaxies .",
    "the half - light radii are thus systematically underestimated .",
    "the fraction of missed flux depends on the profile shape @xcite , such that the size is underestimated more , and with greater variation , for higher-@xmath0 objects .",
    "srsicsizes are therefore often regarded as being more reliable than aperture - based measurements @xcite .",

    "[ cfr_rsize ] ]    galapagos-2 also returns the coefficients that describe the polynomial wavelength - dependence of each parameter . as described below , this function",
    "can be used to ` interpolate ' between the bands , e.g.  in order to derive rest - frame values . on high signal - to - noise data",
    ", one could in principle fit each band independently and then fit a polynomial to the individual - band results in order to derive a continuous function of wavelength . on high",
    "s / n data , for single - component fits , this would give more or less equivalent results to our approach .",
    "however , on lower signal - to - noise images our approach is substantially more robust ( h13 , @xcite , bamford et al .",
    "nevertheless , there are cases where directly using the fit polynomial function to interpolate between bands is inadvisable .",
    "if a high degree of freedom is given to a certain parameter ( e.g.  magnitude in our case ) , the polynomial may oscillate between the wavelengths at which it is constrained by data , and especially in regions close to the edge of the wavelength range of the input data .",
    "this is a general issue encountered when fitting polynomials , known as ` runge s phenomenon . ' as a consequence , we do not use the polynomial derived for the magnitudes to directly calculate rest - frame magnitudes for all objects .",
    "instead , we recommend using the magnitudes derived for each input band to accurately estimate rest - frame magnitudes and colours using a stellar population fitting code .",
    "we match our sample to the gama redshift catalogue ( specobjv21 ) .",
    "for the galaxies in the catalogue , we compute absolute magnitudes by applying interrest @xcite to our measured photometry .",
    "this tool determines rest - frame colours by interpolating the observed photometry , using a number of template spectra as guides ( for details , see @xcite ) .    for srsicindex and effective radii ,",
    "the polynomial order is sufficiently low that runge s phenomenon is not an issue .",
    "we can therefore conveniently calculate rest - frame values directly using the respective chebyshev functions returned by galfitm , provided the required wavelength is in the range covered by the input data . for the remainder of this paper ,",
    "all mentions of wavelength , or ` band ' , refer to rest - frame quantities , unless explicitly stated otherwise .    as in h13 , the catalogue resulting from galapagos-2 has been cleaned in order to select only the objects that have been successfully fit by galfitm .",
    "in particular , we wish to identify and discard fits with one or more parameters lying on ( or very close to ) a fitting constraint .",
    "such a fit is unlikely to have found a true minimum in @xmath33 space and is indicative of a serious mismatch between the model profile and the object in question .",
    "the selection also serves to remove stars from the catalogue . following h13",
    ", we extract those galaxies that satisfy the following criteria :    * @xmath34 at all wavelengths , where @xmath28 is the total apparent output magnitude in each band .",
    "* @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the starting value of the magnitude in each band .",
    "these are derived by scaling an average galaxy sed ( obtained from previous fits ) by the @xmath37 value measured by sextractorduring the object detection . as it is known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that galfitis very stable against changing the starting values , such an approach is valid and was easy to implement into galapagos-2 ( see h13 for details ) . during the fit , we allow a generous @xmath38 magnitudes variation from these starting values .",
    "* @xmath39 , since fits with values outside these ranges are rarely meaningful ( @xcite ; though note that some elliptical galaxies are indeed measured to have @xmath40 , e.g. , as shown in @xcite . ) * @xmath41 pixels , which maintains values in a physically meaningful range and prevents the code from fitting very small sizes , where , due to oversampling issues , the fitting iterations become very slow . *",
    "@xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the axis ratio , to ensure the fit value is physically meaningful . in practice , this constraint is barely ever encountered .",
    "this catalogue cleaning is done on all bands simultaneously , i.e.  if any value of the fit fails to meet the above criteria for any band , the entire fit is considered unsuccessful . and",
    "@xmath44  pixel ) is not used in this paper .",
    "the purpose of this cut was to separate ( mainly saturated ) stars from galaxies in order to derive a cleaner galaxy sample for code testing and comparing single- and multi - band fitting techniques . in this paper , this step is not necessary as galaxies are selected by a redshift criterion .",
    "avoiding it prevents us from accidentally removing bright , compact galaxies from our sample . ]",
    "we additionally exclude objects with :    * @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; * @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; * @xmath49 and @xmath50 ;    which are objects close to areas for which at least one of the infrared bands ( @xmath24 ) does not provide good data quality .",
    "the first one of these areas has no data coverage in the j - band image , the other two are close to very bright stars which caused scattered light in the image , essentially making them unusable in some of the band in these areas . rather than fitting different galaxies using different combinations of bands ,",
    "we prefer to maintain a homogeneous dataset and excluded galaxies in these areas .      to make quantitative , representative statements we choose to volume limit our sample .",
    "we also wish to demonstrate our ability to obtain meaningful multi - wavelength structural measurements with low - resolution data , so we elect to push our sample selection to relatively high redshifts .",
    "we therefore focus on the intrinsically bright galaxy population in this paper .",

    "we limit our analysis to galaxies at @xmath54 . for the selected redshift range ,",
    "the rest - frame equivalents of all bands up to and including @xmath13 are within the observed ( @xmath55@xmath19 ) wavelength range , and thus their values can be interpolated .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent for our reddest observed band , @xmath19 , is obviously always extrapolated , hence unreliable , and we therefore exclude it from our analysis .",
    "the nominal apparent magnitude limit of the gama ii redshift survey is @xmath56 , which corresponds to a total absolute magnitude @xmath57 at @xmath58 .",
    "imposing this absolute magnitude limit gives us a complete , volume - limited sample of 14,274 galaxies .",
    "note that this selection means our results are limited to the relatively high - luminosity galaxy population .",
    "the aim of this paper is to carefully analyse how galaxy structural parameters change as a function of wavelength .",
    "we expect different types of galaxies to behave in contrasting ways .",
    "we therefore separate galaxies according to their colour and structure . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the rest - frame @xmath59 colour , and the @xmath30-band srsicindex , @xmath53 , as our reference for separating populations .",
    "the choice of colour is not critical .",
    "however , bracketing the @xmath60break , @xmath59 performs well for separating red and blue populations , despite the noisiness in the sdss @xmath55-band .",
    "after some experimentation , @xmath53 turned out to be the best choice for separating high- and low - concentration populations , which roughly correspond to early- and late - type morphologies in our luminous galaxy sample . choosing @xmath59 and @xmath53",
    "also facilitates comparison with previous sdss studies .",
    "figure  [ col ] plots colour versus srsicindex for our sample .",
    "these are clearly correlated , and the well - known bimodality ( e.g. , @xcite ) is evident .",
    "galaxies may be optimally divided into two types using a sloping cut in this plane . however , we find it is informative to study the behaviour with respect to colour and srsicindex in more detail , and thus apply selections to these two quantities independently .",
    "we empirically divide galaxies into red and blue using the cut @xmath61 .",
    "traditionally the division by colour also includes a magnitude dependence ; however , this is a small effect , particularly at the bright magnitudes considered in this paper . to avoid complicating our analysis",
    "we prefer this simple cut .",
    "in addition to separating red and blue galaxies , we are also interested in the bluest population , which may host starbursts .",
    "we therefore further subdivide the @xmath62 population into ` green ' and ` blue ' galaxies , using a cut at @xmath63 .",
    "we note that our ` green ' galaxies do not correspond to what is commonly understood as the ` green valley ' , between the blue and red modes .",
    "we simply adopt this name to describe objects with blue , but not extremely blue , colours .",
    "henceforth we use italics to explicitly indicate when we are referring to the _ red _ , _ green_or _ blue_samples .",
    "we further divide galaxies by srsicindex , with the aim of better separating disk galaxies from ellipticals . following previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",

    "with these combined cuts we can compare the two main galaxy populations : _ green _  _ low-@xmath0_systems , which correspond to star - forming , disk - dominated galaxies , and _ red _  _ high-@xmath0_systems , which are typically passive spheroid - dominated galaxies .",
    "we can also examine the properties of galaxies which do not respect the majority behaviour .",

    "we study how the structural properties of galaxies , characterised by different colours and surface brightness profiles , vary with wavelength .",
    "trends in galaxy properties with wavelength may be studied from two perspectives .",
    "one can investigate correlations for an entire galaxy population , or measure variations in individual galaxies .",
    "the first approach is useful when the variations in individual galaxies are noisy .",
    "combining large samples allows one to identify trends which would be obscure for individual objects .",
    "such population trends do not guarantee that galaxies individually follow the average trend , but they can place constraints on the range of variation for individual galaxies . averaged trends also do not allow one to easily select subsamples with specific properties .",
    "the second approach is possible when one has sufficiently reliable measurements . in this case",
    "it is preferable to study the distributions of those measurements directly . in this way",
    ", one can examine how consistent the trends are across the galaxy population and isolate subsamples with different behaviour .",
    "we first consider trends in srsicindex and effective radius versus wavelength , averaged across various subsets of the galaxy population .",
    "we then consider the distributions of these trends for individual galaxies .",
    "these individual measurements allow us to study correlations of the trends with other quantities , and consider their use in classifying galaxies .",
    "we show that the population trends , like those presented by @xcite and @xcite , do successfully capture the typical wavelength variation of srsicindex and effective radius in individual galaxies .",
    "finally , we investigate the correlations between wavelength variations in srsicindex and effective radius , finding highly contrasting behaviour for early- and late- type galaxies .    this section will focus on presenting the observed variation of srsicindex and effective radius and their respective ratios at different wavelengths .",

    "we remind the reader that in the above analysis we have not applied any cut in @xmath0 : a cut in the colour - magnitude plane results in a natural separation of galaxies with small and large srsicindex . however , the correlation is not perfect , as is clear from fig .",

    "the adopted srsicindex cut at @xmath64 does not appear to significantly alter the trends we recover for the _ low-@xmath0_and _ high-@xmath0_populations .",
    "the @xmath0 distributions for each colour sample are sufficiently distinct and narrow that only a small fraction of each distribution is affected by the srsicindex cut .",

    ", it is also reassuring to note that the spheroidal population retains high srsicindex values across all wavelengths .",
    "this indicates that performing the srsicindex separation in different bands would not substantially affect the samples , nor the above results .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ n_med_n ] does suggest that separating in bluer bands , where the populations are better separated , is advisable .",
    "the analysis we have presented so far considered average trends across a sample of galaxies .",
    "if all galaxies in a given sample behave in the same way , then the trends in the average do reflect the trends in the individual galaxies . however , there is the possibility that individual galaxies have behaviours which can not be easily identified from the distributions of srsicindex in different bands .",
    "for example , if the average @xmath0 for a sample does not change between two bands , it could be that all the constituent galaxies have constant @xmath0 , but it is also plausible that half the galaxies increase their @xmath0 while the other half decrease , or that most remain constant while a minority display a significant trend , etc .",
    "we have already seen such behaviour when dividing by colour : different trends have been revealed for particular subsamples . in this case",
    "we were able to discover this by dividing by srsicindex , but ideally we would like to look for such trends directly in the full sample .    in this section",
    "we aim to explore the wavelength dependence of srsicindex for individual galaxies .",
    "this is difficult when fitting galaxies independently in each band .",
    "however , as shown by h13 , our multi - band method dramatically reduces the noise on such measurements and avoids cases where galaxies are successfully fit in some bands , but not in others .",
    "we thus have measurements of srsicindex in every band for all objects in our sample . with this information it is possible to devise various ways of quantifying the wavelength dependence of srsicindex . in this paper",
    "we take the conceptually and computationally simple approach of comparing values at particular pairs of wavelengths , by taking their ratio .",
    "we will investigate what these ratios can tell us about the correlations between galaxy stellar populations and spatial structure .    for compactness",
    "we adopt the notation = @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the srsicindices in some ( rest - frame ) red and blue band , respectively ( we thus generally maintain the same convention as colour ) . using a ratio , rather than a difference ,",
    "is appropriate , as the physical distinction between profiles separated by constant @xmath86 decreases for larger @xmath0 ; i.e.  there is more ` difference ' between @xmath87 and @xmath88 profiles , than between @xmath89 and @xmath90 profiles .",
    "this is the same reason why @xmath0 is usually plotted with a logarithmic scale .",
    "however , the use of a ratio results in asymmetric behaviour when plotted linearly : low ratios are confined to between @xmath91 and @xmath11 , while high ratios may extend to infinity . to avoid this we usually plot on a logarithmic scale .",
    "these choices result in distributions that look much more symmetrical and gaussian than otherwise , justifying our approach .",
    "we begin by inspecting how galaxy colour varies with , and specifically focus on the dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath92 .",
    "this combination of bands ( @xmath13 and @xmath18 ) is favoured here , and throughout the paper , as it is the pair with the longest robust wavelength baseline ( @xmath55 is noisy and @xmath19 is extrapolated ) .    the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ur_nn ] shows that the colour bimodality is accompanied by a shift of the blue population to higher values of than the red population .",

    "low-@xmath0_sample being disk galaxies , comprising a blue @xmath87 disk and red @xmath93 bulge , such that the disk is more prominent in @xmath18 than in @xmath13 .",
    "although subtle , a curve is apparent in the median versus @xmath68 .",
    "_ low-@xmath0_galaxies with intermediate colours have the greatest variations of srsicindex with wavelength , consistent with the bulge and disk being of similar prominence , but differing colour , in these systems .",
    "in contrast , the _ high-@xmath0_galaxies , which are mostly red , display a distribution that is centred on @xmath94 , indicating that the profile of these galaxies is similar at all wavelengths .",
    "there is a tail of _ high-@xmath0_galaxies to blue colours , which tend to have @xmath95 .",
    "this suggests that _ blue _ , _ high-@xmath0_galaxies have peakier profiles at blue wavelengths , possibly indicating the presence of a central starburst .    the segregation of galaxy populations seen in fig .",
    "[ ur_nn ] suggests that could be used as a proxy to separate galaxy types or identify specific populations .",

    "however , we reiterate that our definitions of _ blue_versus _ red_and _ low-@xmath0_versus _ high-@xmath0_depend on our sample selection and adopted magnitude cut .",

    "all else being equal , galaxies with @xmath133 should therefore appear redder in their centres , bluer at intermediate radii , and then redder again in their outskirts . in practice , however , the behaviour in the outskirts is often lost in the sky noise and the s / n - weighting scheme employed by galfitmeans that it cares much less about the outer profile .",
    "@xmath95 implies the opposite behaviour , that galaxies are peakier in bluer bands , whereas @xmath94 indicates that the profile has a similar shape at all wavelengths .    quantifies the variation in size with wavelength .",
    "for example , @xmath95 implies that a galaxy is smaller in redder bands .",
    "all else being equal , galaxies with @xmath95 should therefore appear redder in their centres and bluer toward their outskirts .",
    "@xmath133 implies the opposite behaviour , whereas @xmath94 indicates a constant color with radius .",
    "thus works much like a conventional colour gradient , and in the same sense , in that a negative colour gradient would imply a bluer colour with increasing radius .    note that ( considering only the behaviour at @xmath134 ) variations in may represent similar visual effects to variations in , but in an opposite sense ( i.e.  in broad terms , increasing mimics decreasing ) .",
    "however , although and can produce superficially the same appearance , as we have seen above they are certainly not interchangeable , providing distinct information regarding the dependence of galaxy structure on wavelength .",
    "figure  [ example_images ] presents colour images of two galaxies .",
    "these are chosen to be bright , well - resolved objects , but are otherwise typical examples from our _ red _ , _ high-@xmath0 _ , and _ green _ , _ low-@xmath0_samples .",
    "we have examined a large number of similar images , and see that the general behaviour expected from our and measurements is confirmed by visual inspection .",
    "when we compare individual galaxies with similar properties , but different values of or , it is possible to see differences .",
    "however , this is somewhat obscured by other variations between individual galaxies , and the relatively low signal - to - noise of many of the objects in our sample . in order to demonstrate that and do represent true differences in the appearance of galaxies in an incontrovertible manner , we have stacked galaxies with similar properties . in this way",
    "individual galaxy - to - galaxy variations are averaged out and the signal - to - noise is improved .",
    "recall that figures  [ nn_rr ] and [ nn_rr_col ] shows that and are somewhat correlated , although the correlation is reduced when dividing by colour and srsicindex .",

    "we combine the images using a 3-@xmath74 clipped mean , to exclude neighbouring object and atypical galaxies from the resulting stacked image .",
    "we further avoid any undue influence from outliers by applying the following limits to the objects in the stacks : @xmath135 ; @xmath136 ; @xmath137 pixels and @xmath138 .",
    "we can therefore be sure that any features we see are associated with the main distribution of galaxies . so that the stack is not dominated by bright galaxies , before averaging we scale the images to the same object magnitude , and to preserve axial ratio information we rotate each image such that the galaxy s major axis is horizontal .",
    "no scaling of the object sizes or circularisation is performed , as these operations were found to introduce artefacts due to distorting the point spread function ( psf ) .",

    "we also create stacked images for all galaxies of a given colour and srsicindex , irrespective of or , for example , all red , high-@xmath0 objects .",
    "the differences between the stacked images are relatively clear . however , to further aid their comparison , for each - or -specific stack we subtract the stack of all galaxies with the same colour and srsicindex .",
    "the results are presented as both @xmath144 residual colour images and maps of the ratio of the @xmath13 and @xmath18 residuals .",

    "in this paper we have explored how galaxy structure varies with wavelength ( from rest - frame @xmath55 to @xmath13 ) , for populations selected by srsicindex and colour , using a volume - limited sample of 14,274 bright galaxies .",
    "we measure galaxy sizes and radial profile shapes more accurately than previous studies , by utilising a new technique which fits consistent , wavelength - dependent , two - dimensional srsicprofiles to imaging in a collection of wavebands . using this method",
    ", we confirm that the behaviours of individual galaxies generally follow the average trends of populations of similar objects .",
    "we are also able to identify individual galaxies with a particular wavelength dependence of their structural parameters , and hence create samples of objects that are similar in this respect .",
    "we find that both effective radius and srsicindex typically vary with wavelength .",
    "the sizes of all types of galaxies decrease substantially with increasing wavelength , with high-@xmath0 galaxies showing the greatest variation .",
    "the behaviour of srsicindex is more sensitive to galaxy type : for high-@xmath0 galaxies srsicindex is constant with wavelength , while for low-@xmath0 galaxies it varies dramatically .",
    "we now discuss our findings in the context of other works : first comparing to similar studies on whose results we build , then considering the physical processes responsible for the trends we measure , and finally suggesting how subsequent studies of galaxy structure can help to further differentiate between models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the spider project @xcite has performed a careful analysis of the structural parameters of low - redshift early - type galaxies as a function of wavelength .",
    "they fit srsicprofiles to imaging data from the same surveys as us ( @xmath146 from sdss and @xmath24 from ukidss las ) using a similar tool ( 2dphot ; @xcite ) , but fitting each waveband independently .",
    "@xcite found that , for early - types , @xmath1 decreases by @xmath147% from ( observed frame ) @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "they attributed this variation to the presence of negative internal colour gradients , such that the light profile becomes more compact as one moves from shorter to longer wavelengths .",
    "the srsicindices of their objects span @xmath148@xmath16 , with a median of @xmath17 for all wavebands .",
    "they find little variation of srsicindex with wavelength .",
    "although their average @xmath0 does perhaps increase slightly ( @xmath149% ) from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , the trend is noisy and consistent with being flat .",
    "@xcite select their early - type galaxies as being bright ( @xmath150 ) , having a passive spectral type and being better represented by a de vaucouleur profile than an exponential one .",
    "this roughly corresponds to our selection of _",
    "red__high-@xmath0_objects , although our average @xmath151 is slightly lower than theirs . for this sample",
    "we find very similar results : a @xmath152% increase in @xmath1 from ( rest - frame ) @xmath55 to @xmath13 , while the srsicindex remains stable , varying by @xmath153% over the same wavelength range .",
    "as @xcite point out , this behaviour is also consistent with @xcite and @xcite ; the latter of which demonstrates that the behaviour of @xmath1 corresponds to an increase in the slope of the fundamental plane with wavelength , further confirmed by @xcite and references therein .",
    "@xcite similarly perform two - dimensional single - srsicfits to sdss and ukidss las @xmath154 images of galaxies in the gama survey , using galfitto fit each bandpass independently .",
    "they defined two galaxy subpopulations , based on @xmath19-band srsicindex and @xmath139 rest - frame colour , and analysed the wavelength dependence of their structural parameters .",
    "they find that the mean effective radius of their early - types shows a smooth variation with wavelength , decreasing by @xmath155% from ( observed frame ) @xmath18 through @xmath19 .",
    "although their early - type selection is similar to ours , their sample is magnitude - limited ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "compared to the volume - limited samples of our work and @xcite it therefore contains additional low - luminosity , low - redshift and high - luminosity , high - redshift objects .",
    "even so , the majority of galaxies in all these studies have similar luminosity ranges , and their findings are very similar .",
    "@xcite quote an increase in average srsicindex of early - types of @xmath157% over @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "however , as with @xcite , the trend is rather noisy , and fairly consistent with being flat .",
    "@xcite expand on the study of @xcite by also considering the late - type galaxy population .",
    "these exhibit a more dramatic change in average srsicindex , increasing by @xmath158% from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , and a more gentle variation in effective radius , decreasing by @xmath159% over the same wavelength range .",
    "we find an identical @xmath159% variation in effective radius , but an even more extreme variation in srsicindex , of @xmath160% ( i.e. a factor of two ) from rest - frame @xmath55 to @xmath13 band .",
    "our results are therefore in excellent qualitative agreement with those of @xcite",
    ". it may be that the differing selections play a role in the detailed differences : in addition to the different luminosity ranges , the joint @xmath69 and @xmath139 selection adopted by @xcite contrasts with our orthogonal @xmath53 and @xmath139 selections .",
    "for example , @xcite includes objects with low srsicindex ( @xmath161 ) in the early - type sample provided they are sufficiently red .",
    "we also expect our individual measurements to display significantly less scatter , due to our multi - wavelength method ( h13 , @xcite ) , which may help us recover smoother , more accurate trends .",
    "note that @xcite chose to classify galaxies using the srsicindex in the @xmath19-band , in order to avoid any potential misclassifications due to the effects of dust attenuation . however , we assert that it is cleaner to use an optical srsicindex for this purpose , as the separation between early and late - type galaxies is greater at shorter wavelengths .",
    "since our analysis is based on the same imaging , we can directly compare our results to @xcite we have tried applying their selection criteria to our measurements and find excellent agreement between the recovered trends .",
    "when averaging over a large sample , our different approaches to measuring the wavelength dependence of srsicindex and effective radius give very similar results .",
    "the patterns revealed in fig .",
    "[ nn_rr ] provide important insights regarding the links between the stellar populations and internal structures of galaxies .",
    "some of the revealed trends are rather surprising and deserve deeper investigation .      for _ high-@xmath0_galaxies ,",
    "the constancy of srsicindex with wavelength (  @xmath94 ) , despite strong variations in effective radius (  @xmath95 ) , points to very substantial differences in the stellar populations of early - types as a function of radius , but which are not associated with a change in profile shape .    our clear result that _ high-@xmath0_galaxies appear substantially smaller at longer wavelengths appears to largely rule out the scenario in which gas rich mergers build high-@xmath0 galaxies that are a combination of an old ( red ) , large-@xmath1 component together with a younger ( bluer ) , inner stellar component formed from the gas @xcite .",
    "if this is a significant mechanism in the formation of massive ellipticals , it must primarily occur at higher redshifts , and its signatures must be eclipsed by subsequent evolutionary processes , such as dry minor mergers ( e.g. , two phase galaxy formation : @xcite ) .",
    "lower mass galaxies ( both star - forming and passive ) contain younger and lower metallicity stellar populations , and are therefore bluer in colour ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at later times",
    ", accreting material will fall on to the primary galaxy at higher velocities , as both the total mass of the primary and the distance from which merging galaxies originate increases with time .",
    "stars accreted at later times relax into a more extended structure than the stars produced in the initial formation of the primary galaxy @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the preferential accretion of collisionless dark matter to the outskirts of haloes , leaving their inner profiles unchanged @xcite .",
    "recent simulation studies have demonstrated similar behaviour for stars accreted on to galaxies during minor mergers @xcite .",
    "stars added by minor mergers end up in extended srsicprofiles resulting in a substantial increase in their effective radii for a modest increase in mass .",
    "this ` inside - out ' growth scenario has gained widespread support as the mechanism responsible for the dramatic evolution of compact high - redshift ellipticals to their present , extended , forms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "early - type galaxies are thus expected to comprise a compact red population of stars formed in - situ and a more diffuse , bluer population of stars formed in accreted systems .",
    "it is therefore reasonable for their effective radius to decrease with wavelength .",
    "however , as well as increasing the effective radius , the addition of surface brightness to the outskirts of galaxies would also be expected to increase the srsicindex .",
    "indeed , this effect is seen in previously mentioned simulations @xcite , and is consistent with observations of massive elliptical galaxies with high srsicindices @xcite .",
    "so , how can we reconcile the substantial variation in effective radius with wavelength with little or no corresponding change in srsicindex ?",
    "the reality is that an early - type galaxy will have experienced a variety of merger events .",
    "the stars from each of these will be accreted over different ranges of radius , while in - situ stars will be somewhat redistributed , and the presence of gas may lead to the formation of stars in the galaxy centre .",
    "adding stars in the outskirts of a galaxy increases @xmath0 and increases @xmath1 . adding stars in the centre increases @xmath0 and decreases @xmath1 .",
    "however , adding stars at the effective radius ( i.e. , @xmath162 ) decreases @xmath0 with no change in @xmath1 .",
    "so , by adding material around @xmath1 as well as further out , it is possible to increase @xmath1 while maintaining @xmath0 roughly constant .",
    "also note that as the effective radius grows due to stellar accretion , subsequent accretion at the same physical radius ( in terms of absolute distance and gravitational potential ) will be closer to the effective radius , and hence will act to stabilise @xmath0 .",
    "it can be easily checked that the sum of multiple srsicprofiles spanning a range of @xmath1 , but each with the same @xmath0 and similar central surface brightness or total magnitude , is well approximated by another srsicprofile with a similar value of @xmath0 and intermediate @xmath1 ( though this does depend somewhat on the weighting given to different radii ) .",
    "measuring significant variations in @xmath1 with wavelength (  @xmath95 ) , but small variations in @xmath0 (  @xmath94 ) , therefore appears to be a natural outcome of the two - stage formation scenario .",
    "cosmological models incorporating these various early - type evolutionary processes are now becoming available ( e.g. , @xcite ) . comparing the properties of simulated populations of spatially resolved galaxies to the results of this paper will help to determine if and when each of these processes are occurring .      for _ low-@xmath0_objects ,",
    "there is a substantial increase in the average srsicindex from @xmath163 in the blue to @xmath164 in the near - infrared .",
    "this suggests that at short wavelengths , which are sensitive to young stellar populations , the galaxy profile is dominated by an exponential disk , while at longer wavelengths , which are more representative of total stellar mass , the surface brightness profile is steepened by the presence of a bulge .",
    "section [ stacks ] demonstrates that the effect of  @xmath133 and  @xmath95 is to produce a red galaxy centre and blue outskirts .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , such colour gradients of disk galaxies are typically attributed to radial age profiles , in that they are younger at larger radii .",
    "considering colour gradients in terms of the wavelength - dependence of srsicprofile parameters gives a complementary perspective , and emphasises the association between the stellar populations and structural components of these galaxies .",
    "the fact that _ low-@xmath0_galaxies display only a small change in effective radius with wavelength , while showing a significant variation in srsicindex , suggests that the bulge component in these systems is a spheroid with @xmath126 , but which is not substantially smaller than the disk .",
    "this goes against conventional wisdom , but may be a result of our selection of very luminous galaxies , which are typically bulge - dominated .    the different trends in srsicindex versus wavelength seen for _ red_and _ blue_/_green__low-@xmath0_galaxies supports the interpretation of and in terms of a bulge and disk .",
    "_ red__low-@xmath0_galaxies show very little variation in srsicindex (  @xmath94 ) because their bulge and disk components have similar red colours .",
    "_ green_and _ blue__low-@xmath0_galaxies show more substantial variation (  @xmath133 ) because they possess a bluer disk , which contrasts with a red bulge .",
    "although the above argument provides a simple explanation , one must not underestimate the role of dust attenuation in driving , or at least complicating , the trends we observe for _ low-@xmath0_galaxies .",
    "dust attenuation can significantly modify the apparent structure of a galaxy , and introduce substantial variations with wavelength . obscuring the central region of a galaxy",
    "shifts the balance of total flux towards larger radii , artificially increasing the effective radius and reducing the srsicindex , particularly at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this predicted effect has been well discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the effects on the recovered parameters of multi - wavelength srsic - model fits have been particularly studied by @xcite .",
    "we include their predictions in our figs .",
    "[ nn_med ] and [ rr_med ] , which show that while some of the behaviour we observe may be attributable to dust , their model is not able to account for all of the measured variation in @xmath0 and @xmath1 with wavelength .",
    "dust is not expected to be a dominant factor in the attenuation of light within high-@xmath0 ( spheroid - dominated ) systems , hence variations in structural parameters with wavelength can not be ascribed to its presence .",
    "still , we find that these systems exhibit a larger variation in effective radius than that found in low-@xmath0 ( disk - dominated ) systems .",
    "given that such substantial dependences of structure on wavelength are seemingly possible from stellar population gradients alone , it is difficult to judge the importance of dust in driving the trends in low-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "combining measurements of structural parameters versus wavelength with constraints on the mass and distribution of dust from sub - mm observations and appropriate models ( e.g. , @xcite ) will greatly help in this regard .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that another possible explanation for peculiar variations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 with wavelength is the interdependency between recovered srsicindex and effective radius . a change in the srsicindex arising due to",
    "relatively subtle unmodelled effects , e.g. a small core dust component , additional unresolved or disturbed structure in the core , the presence of an active galactic nucleus or uncertainty in the psf , may all induce compensatory changes in the measured effective radius",
    ". however , to be responsible for the average trends we describe , which represent the behaviour of most galaxies in each subsample , such perturbances must be the norm .",
    "future work fitting more complex multi - component models to specific galaxy samples will shed light on this issue , as well as addressing many of the science questions highlighted above .      in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated how the wavelength - dependence of srsicindex ( ) and effective radius ( ) provide an alternative way of considering galaxy colour gradients , and enable a deeper appreciation of the physical origins of such gradients .",
    "for simplicity we have focussed on a sample of bright galaxies , with the added advantage that this selection demonstrates our method s ability to recover meaningful information even for poorly resolved galaxy images .",
    "obvious next steps are to study the variation of and as a function of luminosity ( or stellar mass ) , to examine how the distinctions between galaxies of different colour and concentration ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ nn_rr ] ) are modified for lower - luminosity systems .",
    "the distribution of colour gradients , and hence and , also varies significantly with environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as implied by the dramatic change in the relationship between overall colour and morphology with environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the relative behaviour of colour , srsicindex , and their respective dependencies on wavelength will help us better understand the physical origins of the environmental trends observed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to considering the overall distribution of and for particular galaxy samples , in this paper we have discussed using and to classify galaxies and identify objects with specific properties . our approach is somewhat similar to that presented by @xcite , which uses @xmath68 colour versus @xmath165 colour gradient space to perform a morphological classification of galaxies in sdss . in this space ,",
    "galaxies form well - separated early- and late - type branches .",
    "the location of galaxies along the branches reflects the degree and locality of star formation activity , and monotonically corresponds to a sequence in morphology .",
    "an analysis of the correspondence between , and morphology is underway ( vika et al . , in prep . ) , using the same small , but very well characterised , sample of galaxies studied in @xcite .",
    "one major advantage of utilising colour gradient information is that blue early - type galaxies are separated from spiral galaxies , as the former tend to have either a nearly constant color profile or bluer cores , while the latter tend to have a red central bulge plus blue outer disk .",
    "we can make similar distinctions using the different and behaviour for galaxies with contrasting internal structures .",
    "both @xcite and our method are capable of identifying a variety of unusual objects , such as central starbursts and passive disk galaxies .",
    "we therefore foresee much potential in studying the occurrence of such galaxies as a function of stellar mass and environment .    of course , another extension of this work would be to go beyond single - srsicprofiles , to fit multiple component models .",
    "these are already starting to be used to great effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) . using a multi - component ,",
    "wavelength - dependent model is straightforward with galfitm , and we are currently working with bulge - disk decompositions to help identify the correct interpretation of the trends in single - srsicparameters .",
    "however , while multi - component models provide more detail , they require more assumptions , not least that the chosen multi - component combination is appropriate to each galaxy in question .",
    "they are also more sensitive to practical details of galaxy data , e.g. the presence of spiral arms or small , undeblended companions , and ensuring one finds the true optimal fit is considerably more difficult .",
    "the simplicity and robustness of single - srsicfitting means that it will long continue to be a valuable approach , especially when pushing the signal - to - noise and resolution boundaries of any dataset .",
    "we have studied the dependence of srsicindex ( @xmath0 ) and effective radius ( @xmath1 ) on wavelength using a volume - limited sample of bright galaxies ( @xmath166 , @xmath58 ) , with homogeneous @xmath154 imaging compiled by the gama survey @xcite .",
    "the srsicprofile parameters were obtained by exploiting the capability of galapagos-2 and galfitmto fit consistent , wavelength - dependent galaxy models to a collection of multi - wavelength imaging .",
    "these measurements have been shown to be more accurate and robust than those obtained by fitting galaxies independently in each waveband ( see h13 , @xcite ) .",
    "we presented the wavelength dependence of the srsicindex and effective radius distributions for the entire sample , and for subsamples split by rest - frame @xmath68 colour and the @xmath30-band srsicindex ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "importantly , our multi - wavelength measurements are accurate and meaningful on an individual galaxy basis .",
    "our analysis is thus able to go a step further than previous studies and consider the wavelength variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for individual galaxies .",
    "we describe this using the ratio of the values in two wavebands , which we denote as and , respectively . in this paper",
    "we primarily focus on variations between @xmath18- and @xmath13-band , which is representative of the behaviour for other pairs of optical and nir bands .",
    "we present the distributions of and for the various colour and srsicindex combinations , and show that their unimodality implies that results based on population trends well represent the behaviour of individual galaxies in each subsample .",
    "the dependence of median and on wavelength shows contrasting trends for different galaxy types , which reveal their different physical natures .",
    "the -plane can be used to classify galaxies and , particularly in combination with colour and srsicindex , identify objects with interesting properties .",
    "finally , we have illustrated the implications of and on the appearance of galaxies , and demonstrated their relationship to colour gradients , by coadding images for various selections .",
    "our main results from all this analysis can be summarised as follows .",
    "all these results are based on a volume - limited sample of bright galaxies .",
    "the studied trends are likely to vary for the less - luminous , dwarf galaxy population , but we leave an exploration of this issue for future work .    * galaxies of opposing colour are characterised by very different srsicindex distributions , which depend differently upon the wavelength at which the srsicindex is measured .",
    "the median srsicindex for _ red_galaxies does not depend on wavelength , while for our _ blue_and _ green_galaxy subsamples the median srsicindex increases significantly at longer wavelengths .",
    "in contrast , galaxies with different colours display similar distributions of effective radius . while galaxies in our _ red_subsample are typically slightly smaller than the others , the distributions of all colours shift consistently toward lower values at longer wavelengths . * using srsicindex to divide the galaxy population , _",
    "high-@xmath0_galaxies display much less srsicindex variation with wavelength than _ low-@xmath0_galaxies .",
    "_ red _ , _ high-@xmath0_galaxies show no significant dependence of srsicindex on wavelength at all . on average ,",
    "they possess a classic de vaucouleur profile at all wavelengths .",
    "high-@xmath0_galaxies show mild dependences on wavelength . however , the median srsicindex for our _ green__high-@xmath0_subsample increases toward longer wavelengths , while our more extreme _ blue__high-@xmath0_subsample shows a significant decrease .",
    "the srsicindices of _ low-@xmath0_galaxies increase dramatically toward longer wavelengths , irrespective of colour , though our _ red__low-@xmath0_subsample shows slightly less variation . * with regard to effective radius , _",
    "low-@xmath0_samples of all colours display very similar behaviour .",
    "our _ high-@xmath0_samples show stronger trends , which vary for different colour selections . in all the cases",
    ", sizes decrease toward redder wavelengths . * by measuring for the first time the dependence of srsicindex on wavelength for individual galaxies ( ) , we find that this quantity adds important information about galaxy structure , helping to robustly separate single - component and bulge - disk systems . _ low-@xmath0_galaxies show  @xmath167 , with the value strongly increasing with the wavelength range considered , suggesting a combination of a blue exponential disk and smaller and/or higher-@xmath0 red spheroid . _",
    "high-@xmath0_galaxies show rather flat trends (  @xmath94 ) , indicating that they are typically one - component objects .",
    "galaxies that deviate from these behaviours are likely to be at interesting evolutionary stages . *",
    "similarly , the ratio of effective radii at different wavelengths ( ) provides insight into the structural make - up of galaxies , although it does not present such disparate behaviour for the various colour and srsicindex subsamples .",
    "the vast majority of galaxies have  @xmath168 : at longer wavelengths galaxies appear smaller . _ low-@xmath0_galaxies show a mild dependence of effective radius on wavelength , which is identical for the different colour subsamples .",
    "_ high-@xmath0_galaxies have a more dramatic dependence , which is stronger for bluer samples . *",
    "combining and together , we show that the medians of different galaxy types ( in terms of colour and srsicindex ) display strikingly different variations in and with wavelength , which succinctly describe the correlations between their internal structures and stellar populations . *",
    "while galaxy subsamples do overlap in the -plane , the location of a galaxy in this diagram puts useful constrains on its structural properties .",
    "this is particularly true if srsicindex and colour are considered too , allowing one to identify , e.g. , central starbursts , blue ellipticals , passive disk galaxies .",
    "the separation of galaxy populations in -may improve for higher resolution and signal - to - noise imaging data . * on average , bright _",
    "high-@xmath0_galaxies appear consistent with possessing multiple superimposed @xmath104 components , each with different effective radii , where the larger profiles are composed of bluer stellar populations .",
    "since the vast majority of galaxies are significantly redder in their central regions , it appears that the proposed formation of young ( blue ) , inner stellar components in elliptical galaxies from accreted gas is negligible for typical bright galaxies at recent times .",
