    "one of the greatest challenges currently facing star formation is the origin and nature of the cold dense molecular cloud cores where protostars form .",
    "interstellar dust in these cores absorbs radiation at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths and re - radiates the energy in the far - infrared and submillimetre .",
    "this series of papers has used the great submillimetre and infrared telescopes to trace that emission and to explore the initial conditions of the star formation process .",
    "@xcite compared the catalogue of dense cores surveyed in molecular lines by myers and his collaborators ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) with the _ iras _ point source catalogue and identified a new class of dense molecular core .",
    "the lack of an infrared point source is taken as evidence that there is no embedded protostellar heat source in these ` starless ' cores . in @xcite of this series",
    "we termed those starless cores which we believed to be undergoing star formation ` pre - protostellar ' cores ( subsequently shortened to ` pre - stellar ' for brevity ) . in and",
    "@xcite we probed the 1.3 m continuum emission from nine pre - stellar cores with the iram telescope .    in @xcite a radiative transfer model fitted to c@xmath2o observations of the core l1689b showed that there was freeze - out of co towards the centre of the core , and that the combination of molecular line and continuum observations could constrain the temperature and density profiles of pre - stellar cores .",
    "the freeze out of molecules with density is widely established with , for example , similar results being found in the dense cores l1544 and b68 @xcite .",
    "the submillimetre and millimetre spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the observed pre - stellar cores from our first four papers showed that our observations were on the rayleigh - jeans side of a greybody spectrum that peaks somewhere around 100 - 200@xmath0 m .",
    "low atmospheric transmission means that observations of this peak are normally impossible from the ground ( with the notable exception of thumper , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observers are forced to fall back on airborne ( e.g. kuiper airborne observatory , * ? ? ? * ) or space based observatories .    the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) was a 65-cm diameter space telescope designed to observe between 2.5 and 240@xmath0 m  @xcite .",
    "it was operated by the european space agency ( esa ) and ceased operations in early 1998 .",
    "we used the imaging photo - polarimeter ( isophot ) on _ iso _  to search for the peak of the pre - stellar greybody spectrum by imaging eighteen cores at 90 , 170 and 200@xmath0 m  and presented our results in @xcite . for each core maps of colour temperature",
    "were constructed using the pixel - to - pixel 170/200-@xmath0 m  spectral index .",
    "these showed that most of the cores are either isothermal or are warmer at the edges , consistent with them lacking an internal heat source ( i.e. a protostar ) and with their surfaces being heated by the local interstellar radiation field .",
    "full radiative transfer analysis also shows similar temperature gradients @xcite .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) were constructed using the isophot data and our previous millimetre and submillimetre data .",
    "these were used to estimate the energy budget of the cores and showed that their infrared luminosity was comparable to the incident energy at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this confirms that the cores are indeed pre - stellar and are only heated by the local interstellar radiation field .",
    "our 200 and 170@xmath0 m  isophot observations showed the importance of far - infrared data to the accurate determination of the spectral energy distribution of pre - stellar cores .",
    "in @xcite we used the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) to conduct a survey towards 52 pre - stellar cores at 450 and 850-@xmath0 m  ( c.f .",
    "twenty - nine of the cores were detected and were separated into ` bright ' and ` intermediate ' groups based on their 850-@xmath0 m  peak intensities .",
    "this split matches the list of evolved prestellar cores identified by @xcite using n@xmath3h@xmath4 and n@xmath3d@xmath4 obervations .",
    "the iso data from was used to calculate the physical parameters of the cores .",
    "this showed that while the normalised column density profiles of the cores have the same shape as an unstable bonnor - ebert sphere @xcite the implied physical characteristics of the spheres did not match those calculated for the cores .",
    "the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _  ( mips , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a far - infrared camera on the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite .",
    "_ spitzer _  is an 85-cm diameter cryogenically - cooled satellite telescope designed to operate from 3 to 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "mips provides _ spitzer _",
    "s long wavelength capabilities and has imaging wavebands at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m  with telescope - limited resolutions of 6 , 18 , and 40 arcsec respectively .",
    "the sensitivity , resolution and large field of view allows for the unparallelled rapid mapping of extended star formation regions .    in this paper",
    "we present mips 160-@xmath0 m  images and 24- & 70-@xmath0 m  flux densities of 18 regions around pre - stellar cores that we have downloaded from the _ spitzer _  data archive . in section [ obs ]",
    "we outline our search strategy and post - pipeline processing . in section [ results ]",
    "we present and discuss the images and extract flux density measurements . in section [ seds ]",
    "we reprise our seds from and update them by including the new _ spitzer _  data from this paper . in section [ discuss ]",
    "we discuss the implications for the nature and lifetimes of pre - stellar cores .",
    "a search of the _ spitzer _  data archive was made using the leopard software tool @xcite .",
    "the positions of pre - stellar cores from were cross - referenced against the archive and coincident 160-@xmath0 m  observations were identified . the unfiltered basic calibrated data ( bcd ) version of the mips 160-@xmath0 m  data were downloaded and re - gridded onto images with 15 arcsec diameter pixels using the mopex routine mosaic @xcite . most of the archive data had been reduced with software pipeline version s11 while the region l1517 was reduced with pipeline version s13.2 .",
    "the mips 160-@xmath0 m  array only has half the field - of - view of the larger 24 and 70-@xmath0 m  arrays .",
    "for the slow and medium raster scanning modes this is not a significant problem as the field - of - view is stepped forward in increments smaller than the width of the 160-@xmath0 m  array .",
    "however with the fast raster scanning mode , used to efficiently observe large areas , the array is stepped forward in increments equivalent to the width of the shorter wavelength arrays , resulting in the sky plane being under - sampled by a factor of 2 at 160-@xmath0 m .",
    "thus the recommended best practise for fast - scanning is for 4 coverages over each point  an offset forward and backscan over the same area to fully sample the sky and a complete repeat observation to reject spikes caused by cosmic ray strikes on the detectors @xcite .",
    "even with this redundancy it is necessary to reject outlying measurements during the re - gridding and to clean the fast - scanned maps afterwards .",
    "the kappa task ffclean was used iteratively to reject pixels that lay more than 3@xmath5 way from the local pixel mean and then the task fillbad was used to fill the holes left by rejected pixels with a mean of the four - nearest good - pixels @xcite .",
    "the percentage of pixels filled by this method was found to be a product of scan - speed and absolute background intensity .",
    "the intensity of the good pixels was not altered by this method .",
    "the medium scan maps did not require filtering while the fast scan areas required less that 30 per cent filling with all four - pixels for the mean coming from the eight neighbouring pixels .",
    "this gives a filtering scale of 3 pixels , 45 arcsec , comparable to the 40 arcsec mips beam at 160-@xmath0 m .",
    "filtering in this manner will change the resolution , but only for those pixels actually infilled .",
    "we can estimate the magnitude of this change by adding the filtering length to the intrinsic resolution in the normal quadrature manner , but we weight the filtering scale by the percentage of pixels replaced . using an upper - limit of 30 percent gives an estimate of the `` effective resolution '' of 47 arcsec , which is 3.1 pixels .",
    "comparison of pixel statistics before and after filtering show that within the 50 per cent contour the the filtering did not significantly alter the mean pixel value , this is to be expected as the filling was based on the local mean .",
    "the peak intensity within that contour was also unaffected as , by definition , the infill value can not be greater than that of any of the surrounding pixels",
    ". however , this does not preclude the true intensity peak being coincident with a blank pixel .",
    "the upper - limit of the number of pixels infilled is consistent with a 70 percent certainty of measuring the true peak intensity .",
    "the only core at variance with the above is l1689a which was close to the absolute saturation limit ( see following section ) .",
    "approximately 60 per cent of its area had to be reconstructed and it is possible that the peak intensity has been underestimated .",
    "this combination of ffclean and fillbad was found to be relatively simple , robust and fast .    ._spitzer",
    "_  archive details .",
    "the data set identifiers are given for all _ spitzer _  archive data included in this paper . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab : coreprop ] shows the mean core properties derived from our scuba observations and our _ spitzer _  observations ( this paper ) .",
    "the first line lists the sample size with the numbers in parenthesis referencing the 7 cores that are common to both samples ( l1521f has been excluded from both ) .",
    "lines 24 list the measured peak intensities and flux densities in a 150 arcsec aperture .",
    "a `` bg '' subscript denotes a background subtracted measurement or a quantity derived from that measurement .",
    "scuba observations are automatically counted as background subtracted because it uses a chopping secondary mirror to reject sky emission .",
    "line 5 lists the mean of the core masses derived from the 150 arcsec aperture fluxes at the two wavelengths . when constructing an sed we assume that the same mass of gas is radiating at all wavelengths .",
    "if that assumption holds then we should expect to derive identical mass estimates from different points on the sed .",
    "that the two masses on this line are virtually identical is apparent proof of the aforementioned assumption .",
    "lines 6 and 7 of table [ tab : coreprop ] list the peak h@xmath3 column density before and after background subtraction .",
    "if the core is centrally condensed then we could expect the smaller 850-@xmath0 m  beam to preferentially sample a higher mean column density than the more extended 160-@xmath0 m  beam , which it does .",
    "lines 8 and 9 list the mean deconvolved major and minor full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the cores . for 160@xmath0",
    "m  this is the half - maximum between the peak and the on - cloud background .",
    "line 10 lists hwhm@xmath6 , the geometric mean of half of the fwhm ellipse and line 11 lists its aspect ratio .",
    "line 12 lists @xmath7 the mean estimated mass enclosed by the fwhm ellipse .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath7 are nearly identical at 160@xmath0 m  because the mean core diameter translates to an angular size of @xmath9150 arcsec at the typical distance of these cores ( 140 parsec ) .",
    "@xcite defined prestellar cores as `` that subset of starless cores which are gravitationally bound and hence are expected to participate in the star formation process '' .",
    "for the prestellar cores observed with scuba @xmath10 and can therefore be considered bound . between the two wavelengths shown in table [ tab : coreprop ] the observed radius and mass increase by a factor of three . for a virialised cloud @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the turbulent linewidth of the gas .",
    "therefore , for a constant linewidth @xmath13 is linear with respect to @xmath14 ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "this is the same as the linear scaling seen between the cores as observed with scuba and as observed with _",
    "spitzer _",
    "so it is reasonable to assume that the extra material seen by _",
    "spitzer _  is also in bound .    when comparing the fwhm size and mass of the cores we note that the mean scuba sizes and masses are in agreement with other scuba size / mass studies of nearby star formation ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) whilst the mean of the spitzer sizes and masses are close to submillimetre studies of condensations in the orion region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with these observations and our scuba observations",
    "we are able to probe a spatial regime down to 2000 au ( the fwhm of the scuba 850@xmath0 m  at 140 parsecs ) .",
    "for the 13 confirmed prestellar cores we predominantly see a one to one mapping of closed scuba contours onto closed _",
    "spitzer _",
    "contours suggesting that we are detecting the same single coherent unfragmented object in both sets of observations .",
    "most stars form in multiple systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references there in ) with the implication that at some scale a single core must fragment into multiple protostellar fragments .",
    "that we see no such fragmentation over the scales that we are sensitive to supports the finding of @xcite that fragmentation must occur below the 2000au scale and/or at a later core evolutionary stage ( such as the class 0 stage ) .",
    "fitting of bonner - ebert ( be ) spheres to scuba maps gives an implied pressure bounded outer radius of @xmath15 au ( 0.150 parcecs ; line 13 of table [ tab : coreprop ] ) @xcite .",
    "this is approximately equal to the major fwhm of the _ spitzer _",
    "cores and the radius of dense cores mapped in c@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the mean hwhm of cores in the _ spitzer _",
    "observations is approximately equal to the size of prestellar cores measured from n@xmath3h+ ( 0.054 parsecs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and h@xmath16co+ ( 0.048 parsec ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used the scuba scan mapping mode to map larger areas over a selection of prestellar and protostellar cores .",
    "their maps showed that the area of emission detected from cores with scuba was generally smaller than 2 arcmin across ( the width of the scuba field of view ) .    from the above radii",
    "we can define a `` characteristic '' radius for the full extent of a prestellar core .",
    "this is @xmath90.15 parsec and is the be pressure bounded radius and the radius as measured from co observations . at the distance to these sources",
    "this radius is equivalent to @xmath17 arcmin .",
    "given the complexity of the lowest on - cloud contour in figures [ fig : cores1 ] and [ fig : cores2 ] it is nearly impossible to measure a full extent radius .",
    "however , by inspection , the regions typically have a closed contour radius , @xmath18 , of @xmath93 arcmin ( 0.12 parsecs ; line 14 of table [ tab : coreprop ] ) , comparable to the 3.5 arcmin be radius . then , within this bounding radius there is a centrally condensed region of radius @xmath19 parsec as delineated by observations of high density gas tracers and the fwhm of far - ir dust emission .",
    "in this paper we have presented _ spitzer _  archive data of a sample of 18 molecular cloud cores that were believed to be pre - stellar in nature .",
    "the sample was selected from the 52 cores that we had previously observed with scuba .",
    "we have produced new images of the cores at 160@xmath0 m  and we have measured their flux densities at the other mips wavelengths of 24 and 70@xmath0 m  to produce full seds for the cores , when combined with our previous data .",
    "comparison of background intensities and measured flux densities showed consistency between the absolute and relative mips 170@xmath0mand isophot 160@xmath0mcalibration .",
    "four of the cores were non - detections in our scuba sample .",
    "we refined our previous fits to the remaining 14 core seds and produced temperature estimates for the cores .",
    "most lie in the range 1013k .",
    "only one core was detected at 24@xmath0 m  and seen to need an additional temperature component to fit its sed  l1521f .",
    "this core has recently been reported to contain a protostar , and we confirm this assertion .",
    "however , no other core was detected at 24@xmath0 m and no other core required a hotter dust component to fit its sed .",
    "hence we deduce that the number of misclassified pre - stellar cores is probably small , and the resultant change in the estimated lifetime of the pre - stellar core stage is @xmath205 per cent .",
