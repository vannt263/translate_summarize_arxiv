    "<S> we present systematic calculations on the spectroscopy and transition properties of even - even te isotopes by using the large - scale configuration interaction shell model approach with a realistic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> these nuclei are of particular interest since their yrast spectra show a vibrational - like equally - spaced pattern but the few known e2 transitions show anomalous rotational - like behavior , which can not be reproduced by collective models . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations reproduce well the equally - spaced spectra of those isotopes as well as the constant behavior of the @xmath0 values in @xmath1te . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated @xmath0 values for neutron - deficient and heavier te isotopes show contrasting different behaviors along the yrast line . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 of light isotopes can exhibit a nearly constant bevavior upto high spins . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this is related to the enhanced neutron - proton correlation when approaching @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the advent of large - scale radioactive beam facilities and new detection technologies have enabled the study of the spectroscopy and transition properties of @xmath3 nuclei just above the presumed doubly magic nucleus @xmath4sn @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several unexpected phenomena have recently been observed : large @xmath5 values of neutron deficient semi - magic @xmath6 isotopes have triggered extensive experimental  @xcite and theoretical @xcite activities , in particular regarding the fundamental roles played by core excitations and the nuclear pairing correlation ( or seniority coupling ) . </S>",
    "<S> the study of transition rates in isotopic chains just above @xmath7 may provide further information on the role of core excitations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the limited number of valence protons and neutrons are not expected to induce any significant quadrupole correlation in this region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low - lying collective excitations of those nuclei were discussed in terms of quadrupole vibrations @xcite in relation to the fact that the even - even te isotopes between @xmath8 and 70 show regular equally - spaced yrast spectra ( c.f . , fig . 1 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> if that is the case , the te isotopes will provide an ideal ground to explore the nature of the elusive nuclear vibration and the residual interactions that leading to that collectivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the available e2 transition strengths along the yrast line in @xmath9te show an anomalous rotational - like behavior , which can not be reproduced by collective models or the interacting boson model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another intriguing phenomenon is the nearly constant behavior of the energies of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states in te and xe isotopes and their ratios when approaching @xmath2 , in contrast to the decreasing behavior when approaching @xmath12 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was analyzed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite based on the quasiparticle random phase approximation approach where an competition between the quadurople - quadrupole correlation and neutron - proton pairing correlation was suggested .    </S>",
    "<S> an enhanced interplay between neutrons and protons is expected in the @xmath4sn region since the protons and neutrons partially occupy the same quantum orbitals near the fermi level @xcite . in relation to that , there has also been a long effort searching for superallowed alpha decays from those @xmath3 isotopes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the region is also expected to be the endpoint of the astrophysical rapid proton capture ( rp ) process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the octupole correlation may also play a role here ( the coupling between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , compared to tin , the experimental information is less abundant in the isotopic chain of tellurium where little was known experimentally below the neutron midshell until recently . much more work is needed and further measurements are underway in order to map out the ordering and nature of single - particle states and two - body effective interactions in the region @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we present systematic large - scale calculations on the spectroscopy and transition properties of even - even te isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> the large - scale shell model , which takes into account all degrees of freedom within a given model space , is an ideal approach to study competition between collective and single - particle degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it is however a challenge , especially in the midshell , due to the huge dimension of the problem ( c.f . , </S>",
    "<S> fig . 1 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . on the theoretical side , </S>",
    "<S> we have done systematic calculations on the @xmath15 values of even - even te isotopes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results are , however , rather sensitive to the truncation imposed . </S>",
    "<S> now we are able to do full shell model calculations for all low - lying states of all te isotopes with further optimization of the shell - model algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> a full shell model calculation for the spectroscopy of @xmath16te was done in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a schematic calculation for @xmath17te in the @xmath18 subspace was presented in ref . </S>",

    "<S> ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , respectively . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the possible onset of vibrational collectivity in te isotopes was discussed within an effective field theory framework .        </S>",
    "<S> we consider the neutron and proton orbitals between the shell closures @xmath19 ( and @xmath20 ) @xmath21 and 82 , comprising @xmath22 , @xmath14 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath13 and assume @xmath4sn as the inert core . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of the @xmath25 shell closures , which has fundamental influence on our understanding of the structure of nuclei in this region , is supported by recent measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nearly degenerate neutron single - particle states @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals in @xmath28sn were observed by studying the @xmath29-decay @xmath30te @xmath31 @xmath28sn @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on the assumption that the ground state of @xmath30te has spin - parity @xmath32 , the @xmath27 orbital was suggested to be the ground state of @xmath28sn instead of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energy of the @xmath14 is taken as @xmath33 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of other states have not been measured yet . </S>",
    "<S> they are adjusted to fit the experimental binding energies of tin isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of our calculation is the realistic cd - bonn nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction was renormalized using the perturbative g - matrix approach to take into account the core - polarization effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34 part of the monopole interaction was optimized by fitting to the low - lying states in sn isotopes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further optimization of the @xmath35 part of the interaction is also underway which , however , is still a very challenging task . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the present effective hamiltonian are already pretty successful in describing the structure and transition properties of sb , te , i , xe and cs isotopes as well as heavy nuclei near @xmath12 in this region .    </S>",
    "<S> the te isotopic chain is the heaviest and longest chain that can be described by the nuclear shell model . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension for the mid - shell @xmath36te reaches @xmath37 for which the diagonalization is still a very challenging numeric task . in our previous calculations for the @xmath15 of mid - shell te isotopes  @xcite , we restricted a maximum of four neutrons that can be excited from below the fermi surface to the neutron @xmath38 subshell and excluded proton excitation to @xmath38 due to limited computation power , which , as we understand now , is a rather severe truncation . </S>",
    "<S> the model space was further extended to allow at most 8 particles to the @xmath38 subshell in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the @xmath15 values show a much smoother parabolic behavior as a function of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> full shell - model calculations are done for all nuclei in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> all shell - model calculations are carried out within the @xmath39-scheme where states with @xmath40 are considered . </S>",
    "<S> diagonalizations are done with a parallel shell model program that we developed @xcite and with a slightly modified version of the code kshell @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations are done on the supercomputers beskow and tegnr at pdc center for high performance computing at the kth royal institute of technology in stockholm , sweden .    to test the validity of the effective interaction , </S>",
    "<S> we have done systematic calculations on the yrast spectra of isotopes @xmath41te . </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath42te are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sm ] in comparison with available experimental data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an overall good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> noticeable difference is seen in the excitation energies of the @xmath43 states in @xmath44te and the @xmath45 states in @xmath17te . </S>",
    "<S> all isotopes plotted in the figure show rather regular and vibrational - like spectra up to @xmath43 except @xmath17te . for that nucleus , the calculated spectrum still shows a equally - spaced pattern . </S>",
    "<S> however , a smaller gap between @xmath46 and @xmath47 states is expected from recent measurement but the spin - parity assignments for those states are still tentative . </S>",
    "<S> the equally - spaced pattern breaks down in isotopes heavier than @xmath48te where a gradual depression of the excitation energies of the @xmath49 states is seen .     </S>",
    "<S> comparison between theory and experiment for the energies of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 yrast states ( upper ) and the @xmath15 values ( lower ) for the te isotopic chain . </S>",

    "<S> [ sm2 ] as a function of neutron number for all even - even te isotopes . in the lower panel of the figure , the calculated @xmath15 in tellurium isotopes </S>",
    "<S> are compared to the most recent experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the b(e2 ) value is calculated as @xmath0 = @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the proton and neutron matrix elements and we take effective charges @xmath55 = 1.5e and @xmath56 = 0.8e as were employed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the isospin dependence of the effective charges is not considered here , which is not expected to have large influence on the trend . </S>",
    "<S> the model prediction agrees rather well with available data . </S>",
    "<S> the largest deviations are seen in isotopes @xmath57te . </S>",
    "<S> a recent measurement gave a value smaller than the adapted one in the former case . </S>",
    "<S> in the figure we also plotted the square of the neutron and proton matrix elements , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which represent the separate contributions to the @xmath0 values from the neutron and proton excitations . as can be seen from the figure , the parabolic behavior of the @xmath0 values , which looks similar to that of sn isotopes , is mostly due to the contribution from the neutron excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the proton excitation shows a rather smooth and slightly decreasing behavior as the neutron number increases . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned earlier , the shell - model calculations for mid - shell te isotopes , in particular @xmath36te , are quite sensitive to the filling of both the proton and neutron @xmath38 subshells . </S>",
    "<S> both the proton and neutron transition matrix elements are enhanced when one goes from a small model space calculation with restricted number of particles in @xmath38 to the full shell - model calculation .     </S>",
    "<S> comparison between theory and experiment @xcite for @xmath58 values in @xmath1te along the yrast line . </S>",
    "<S> the open circles and open triangles in the lower panel correspond to the square of the neutron and proton matrix elements , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines correspond to the predictions of collective models @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the regularly - spaced level spectra in mid - shell te isotopes have been expected to be be associated with a collective vibrational motion . for a spectrum corresponds to a vibrator , there should be collective e2 transitions between states differing by one phonon . </S>",
    "<S> the transition strengths should be linearly proportional to the spin of the initial states , i.e. , one has @xmath59=2 in the harmonic vibrator model . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , there are very few data available for @xmath0 values in states beyond @xmath60 . as shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the measured @xmath0 values along the yrast line in @xmath1te show a rather anomalous constant behavior up to @xmath61 , which looks more like a rotor and is in contradiction with that for a vibrator . </S>",
    "<S> our shell model calculations for those e2 transitions are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sm3 ] , which indeed exhibits a rather constant behavior up to higher spins . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , both the proton and neutron matrix elements remain roughly the same along the yrast line .    as can be seen fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sm3 ] , the ratio @xmath59 for @xmath1te is measured to be even slightly smaller than one . </S>",
    "<S> this is not seen in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio is calculated to be @xmath62 which actually agree well with the prediction for a rotor . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it happens rarely in open - shell nuclei that one has @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason why the ratio for @xmath1te is observed to be so small is still not clear .     </S>",
    "<S> calculated @xmath58 values along the yrast line for even - even te isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]   calculated @xmath58 values along the yrast line for even - even te isotopes . , </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]   calculated @xmath58 values along the yrast line for even - even te isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the ratios @xmath59 for isotopes @xmath64te are measured to be 1.640 , 1.500 and 1.162 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the ratios calculated from the shell model @xmath0 values are 1.322 , 1.299 , and 1.301 , respectively , for above three nuclei , which agree reasonably with experimental data .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sm4 ] we plotted the calculated @xmath0 values for the yrast states of all even - even te isotopes between @xmath65 and 80 . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from the upper panel of the figure , the @xmath0 values for the yrast states of @xmath66te , which are at the beginning of the shell , remain roughly constants up to spin @xmath67 and decrease significantly around @xmath68 , which indicates that the collectivity has collapsed there . on the other hand , as shown in the lower panel of the figure , the results for the isotopes @xmath69te at the end of the shell show a very different behavior : the @xmath0 values decrease dramatically after @xmath70 , which reach practically zero value for states up to @xmath71 in all nuclei except @xmath72te . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the groups @xmath73 and @xmath74 are shown in the middle panels of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sm4 ] . in the former group , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 values show a rather constant behavior up to @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath71 diverge in relation to the fact that several low - lying @xmath75 states are predicted for those nuclei by the shell - model calculations and , in cases like @xmath76te shown in the panel , it is the second @xmath75 state that is connected to the yrast @xmath77 state with strong e2 transition . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath78 value vanishes . in the latter group </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath0 values also show a large decrease after @xmath70 but to a extent that is much less than those in the fourth group , @xmath69te .    to understand the behavior of the calculated @xmath0 values seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sm4 ] , we notice that the ratio @xmath79 roughly equally to two for all known te isotopes below @xmath80 . but it decreases rapidly to around 1.2 in the semi - magic @xmath81te . moreover , the ratio @xmath82 starts to decrease already at @xmath83 , resulting in seniority - like spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the seniority quantum number refers to the number of particles that are not paired to @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that , for systems involving the same kind of particles , the low - lying states can be well described within the seniority scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the fact that the @xmath34 two - body matrix elements is dominated by monopole pairing interactions with @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the seniority coupling may be broken by the neutron - proton correlation if both protons and neutrons are present . </S>",
    "<S> this indeed happens in the most neutron deficient te isotopes close to @xmath85 , where the valence neutrons and protons are expected to occupy identical @xmath27 and @xmath26 orbitals and the neutron - proton correlation is expected to be strong . as a results , both the spectra and @xmath86 transition properties show rather regular collective behaviors . on the other hand , for nuclei @xmath69te at the other end of the shell , </S>",
    "<S> the normal seniority coupling may prevail since the neutron - proton correlation involves particles in different shells and is much weaker . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap between @xmath49 and @xmath11 as well as the @xmath86 transition between the two states reduce significantly ( e.g. , @xmath86 transitions between states with the same seniority is disfavored ) . </S>",
    "<S> the groups @xmath73 and @xmath74 fall between above two cases .    if the dimension is not too large , it is possible to project the wave function as a coupling of the proton group and neutron group with good angular momenta in the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 denote the angular momenta of the proton group and neutron neutron group ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state for a even - even nucleus will be represented by a single configuration with @xmath90 if there is no neutron - proton correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron - proton interaction induces contributions from configurations with higher angular momenta for the protons and neutrons as well as higher - lying configurations with the same angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that , as expected , the @xmath16te ground state shows a high mixture of many component , among which one has 47% with @xmath90 , 30% with @xmath91 , 12.5% with @xmath92 , and 6.7% with @xmath93 . for @xmath17te ground state the results are 41.7% with @xmath90 , 42 % with @xmath91 , 11.9% with @xmath92 . for @xmath17te ground state </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from @xmath90 decreases further to 36.3% while the contribution from @xmath91 increases to 46.6% . </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions for other low - lying states show a similar complex structure . on the other hand , the wave functions for the low - lying states of the isotopes </S>",
    "<S> @xmath69te show a much simpler picture and are dominated by either neutron or proton excitations in many cases . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from @xmath90 components are 65.2% , 74.4% and 85.5% for isotopes </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94te . the @xmath60 state in @xmath95te </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by @xmath96 whereas @xmath97 state is dominated by the proton excitation @xmath98 instead . </S>",
    "<S> the low - lying states for @xmath99te show a similar result </S>",
    "<S> .    it may be interesting to mention that a similar picture with rotational - like @xmath0 transitions and vibrational - like spectrum is also predicted for @xmath85 nuclei like @xmath100pd @xcite in relation to the quest for the possible existence of np pairing in @xmath3 nuclei for which there is still no conclusive evidence after long and extensive studies ( see , recent discussions in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath29 formation amplitude may increase as a result of of the strong neutron - proton correlation . </S>",
    "<S> there has already been a long effort answering the question whether the formation probabilities of neutron - deficient @xmath3 te and xe isotopes are larger compared to those of other nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have evaluated within the shell - model approach the @xmath29 formation amplitude @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the neutron - proton correlation is switched on , in particular if a large number of levels is included , there can be indeed significant enhancement of @xmath29 formation amplitude .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have done systematic calculations on the spectroscopy and transition properties of te isotopes within the large - scale configuration interaction shell model approach . </S>",
    "<S> a monopole - optimized realistic interaction is used . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations reproduce well the excitation energies of the low - lying states as well as the regular and vibrational - like behavior of the yrast specta of @xmath101te ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of the first @xmath10 and @xmath11 states as well as their ratios show rather a rather constant behavior when approaching @xmath2 in relation to the enhanced neutron - proton correlation ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a squeezed gap between the @xmath97 and @xmath47 states is expected when approaching @xmath12 , resulting in seniority - like spectra . </S>",
    "<S> those structure changes are also reflected in the calculated and available experimental e2 transition strengths . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated @xmath102 show a parabolic behavior as a function of @xmath19 , which is dominated by the contribution from the neutron excitation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the calculations reproduced reasonably well the nearly constant behavior of the @xmath0 values of @xmath1te and @xmath64te along the yrast line ( figs . 3 & 4 ) . the anomalous constant behavior is related to the competition between the seniority coupling and the neutron - proton correlations . for neutron - deficient te isotopes , the constant behavior of @xmath0 values can be extended to high spin values around @xmath103 14 . </S>",
    "<S> wheras for heavier isotopes , when the neutron - proton correlation gets weaker , the @xmath0 values can reduce significantly after @xmath70 and vanishes for the heaviest isotopes . </S>"
