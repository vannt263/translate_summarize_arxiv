    "in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies some phenomena remain up to now without valid explanation , one of them is the @xmath1 ratios which exhibits a departure from the same ratio , measured in @xmath0 collisions at transverse momenta between 2.0 and @xmath24.5 gev / c@xcite .",
    "although the coalescence model @xcite has been widely accepted , it does not provide a satisfactory response to many questions . beyond the details of the hadronization process which is still a debated question",
    "; it is well known that the @xmath3 spectra of particles of different masses can not be fit with a unique temperature as would predict a naive thermal model . in the nineties",
    "the na44 collaboration has put in evidence the so called _ radial flow_@xcite in heavy ion collisions and it was interpreted as consequence of multiple interaction among the partons after the collisions of ions and before the freeze out of the created system .",
    "this interpretation also was confirmed by recent experimental results from rhic  @xcite .",
    "+ the flow is understood as reflecting collective aspects of the interacting medium , depending on the collision energy . in central collisions between",
    "spherical nuclei , the initial state is symmetric in azimuth implying an isotropic azimuthal distribution of the final state particles .",
    "consequently , any pressure gradient will cause an azimuthally symmetric collective flow of the outgoing particles .",
    "this is what we call radial flow .",
    "+ the relevant observable to study the radial flow is the transverse momenta of the particles . for each particle , the random thermal motion is superimposed onto the collective radial flow velocity , correspondingly , the invariant @xmath3 distribution depends of the temperature at freeze out , the particle mass , and the velocity profile .",
    "the experimental data on radial flow at rhic indicate two things :    * the temperature lowers with centrality while the flow velocity increases  @xcite .",
    "* even for @xmath0 collisions the analysis of the data from star yields a flow value of @xmath4 c    this latter result coupled to the fact that in @xmath0 collisions the @xmath1 ratio could not be reproduced by pythia has encouraged us to investigate what would be the result of the @xmath1 ratio if a flow component would be incorporated .",
    "consequently , in a first step we have generated _ flow - free _ pion and proton spectra using : 1 ) pythia  @xcite with the popcorn baryon production mechanism ( note that from earlier work  @xcite we know that the differences in the ratio at 200 gev are not very large when other baryon production mechanisms are used ) .",
    "2 ) hijing 1.36 .",
    "+ in a second step a toy model of the radial flow is incorporated in the @xmath3 spectra and finally our results are compared with the baryon to meson ratio from star  @xcite in @xmath0 .",
    "we are assuming that a fireball , thermalized , and expanding was created in a collision from an event generator .",
    "the expansion produces an additional momentum to the one created in the collisions .",
    "this contribution we call momentum of the flow @xmath5 given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the lorentz factor , @xmath8 is the profile velocity and @xmath9 is the mass of the particle under consideration . in order to add this radial component to the transverse momenta produced by the generators , it is necessary to attribute to the momentum @xmath3 of each particle a randomized position in the transverse plane .",
    "once this is done , the radial flow component is added vectorially .",
    "in the left side of fig .  [ pthijing - pythia ]",
    "we show the midrapidity ( @xmath10 ) transverse momentum spectra obtained with pythia and hijing .",
    "it is apparent that the two generators do not yield for @xmath0 collisions the same result .",
    "hijing predicts a slightly steeper @xmath3 dependence than pythia . in the right side of the figure  [ pthijing - pythia ]",
    "we show the effect of the afterburner onto the flow free spectra for the proton case .",
    "we have used here a flow velocity of 0.6c to be able to clearly demonstrate the effect .",
    "as expected the flow free and afterburner spectra coincide at higher @xmath3 .",
    "the ratios p/@xmath11 are shown in fig .",
    "[ ppi].in the left we show the results obtained for a flow velocity @xmath8=.2 and .3 , applied to the hijing events , compared withe star pp data the right side of the same figure shows the same data fitted with pythia applying the same flow parameter and an additional one of 0.6c .",
    "it is obvious that the resulting fit is different , pythia requiring a much larger flow velocity than hijing to fit the same spectra .    .",
    "the left correspond to experimental results on @xmath0 collisions from star , comparing with our model using pythia .",
    "the right part shows our model using hijing and comparing it with the experimental results from @xmath0 collisions.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "the left correspond to experimental results on @xmath0 collisions from star , comparing with our model using pythia .",
    "the right part shows our model using hijing and comparing it with the experimental results from @xmath0 collisions.,title=\"fig : \" ]          the data of pp collisions at rhic suggest that even in pp collisions the transverse momentum spectra of different particles are not completely parallel to each other .",
    "the analysis suggests that a _ flow _ velocity albeit small has to be added . without entering in the foundation of the existence or not of flow",
    "we have constructed a toy model where we apply a given quantity of flow to flow free transverse momentum spectra generated by either pythia with the popcorn baryon production mechanism or hijing .",
    "the obtained results demonstrate that both for @xmath0 collisions and peripheral heavy ion collisions we obtain a remarkably good fit to the data using hijing spectra and the velocities extracted in the experiments .",
    "the differences in the quality of the fit observed using pythia indicate that the initial shape of the spectrum is key to a good reproduction of the data .",
    "we conclude that the flow may be one of the key ingredients in the so called baryon puzzle at rhic ."
