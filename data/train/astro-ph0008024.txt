    "this is the only spectrum for which the addition of an absorbed interved gaussian line does not improve the fit ( tab.3 ) .",
    "the 1995  ds / s observation was part of a large multiwavelength campaign during which a powerful tev flare occured ( buckley 1996 ) . simultaneously an x - ray flare developed ( takahashi 1996 ) , and the euv followed with a short delay ( buckley 1996 ) . as illustrated in figure 3 ,",
    "the  observation spanned the flare ( @xmath44 ks ) , the decay ( @xmath45 ks ) and the following quiescent state ( @xmath46 ks ) the observation was performed @xmath47 off - axis and as expected the signal reaches down @xmath48 .",
    "this spectral region is crucial since it covers the location of the wide euv absorption feature proposed by k97 using less than half ( the flare decay ) of the 1995 data . in our analysis",

    "we plot the two - parameter @xmath35 contour confidence levels .",
    "the ` decay ' section of the 1995 spectrum deserves comparison with the analysis of k97 , given the importance of the absorption line evident in their figure  2 .",
    "we show the effect of using the improper @xmath47 off - axis effective area in figure 6b ; we compared the  spectrum obtained using the on - axis effective area ( open cirles ) as in k97 , and the @xmath49 off - axis effective area ( filled squares ) .",
    "the effect of using the appropriate calibration is to increase the flux below @xmath16 and so weaken the absorption feature ( @xmath50% ) .",
    "another effect to consider is that k97 evaluated the level of the continuum in the euv range by adopting an @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) slope derived from the 0.15 kev euv flux and the 1.5 kev x - ray ( ) flux , which resulted in a strong absorption feature ( see also  3 for further discussion on this point ) .    our best fit slope @xmath53 ( table  2 ) is flatter than the @xmath54 in k97 .",
    "if we consider the same wavelength range ( 70 - 95   instead of 70 - 110  ) we find @xmath55 , consistent with k97 result .    a simultaneous fit of an absorbed power law plus an absorbed ( inverted ) gaussian should provide a more reliable result .",
    "if the position of the gaussian is a free parameter then the reduced @xmath56 goes to 1.17 and a narrow ( fwhm=@xmath57  ) absorption feature is found at @xmath58   while the slope becomes significanlty flatter ( @xmath59 ) ( see tab.3 ) .",
    "this is the first time that an absorption feature in the euv range is derived from euv data alone .    both for pks  2155 - 304 ( konigl  1995 ) and for ( k97 ) the presence of absorption features",
    "was previously derived on the basis of an extrapolation of the x - ray power law and not directly from _ euve _ data .",
    "however there is strong evidence that the x - ray spectrum of the high - energy peaked bl lac objects , including , is concave ( sambruna et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ; tashiro et al . 1995 ; takahashi et al .",
    "1996a ; giommi et al .",
    "1998 ; guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 ) and a gradual steepening with energy agrees with the `` synchrotron self compton '' scenario , which has often been used to explain the spectral energy distribution of bl lac objects ( ghisellini , maraschi & treves 1985 , ghisellini 1989 ) .",
    "therefore , a simple power law model is an unreliable extrapolation from x - rays to the euv .    in order to verify this assumption for",
    ", we reanalyze , as an example , one of the many one - hour - long 1995 _ asca _ observations ( the one on 25 - 26 april ) undertaken simultaneously with the _ euve _ observation ( 1995 ` flare ' ) .",
    "this in order to investigate the spectral slope below 1.5 kev ( takahashi  1996b and 1999 only published data for 1.5 kev and above ) .",
    "first we fitted the  spectra with an absorbed broken power law and the best fit requires a break position at @xmath60  kev and the energy slopes varies from @xmath61 above the break to @xmath62 below the break ( consistent with what found by takahashi et al . ) .",
    "the broken power law model however does not give a good fit of the spectrum below 1.5 kev ; a better result is found if we assume a `` curved spectrum '' parametrized as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the low and high energy asymptotic slopes and @xmath67 is the curvature radius in the energy space .",
    "the best fit values for the curved model with fixed @xmath68 ( e.g. guainazzi  1999 ) are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see fig .",
    "10 ) ; these values show that the slope flattens toward lower energies and that an extrapolation with a simple power law is not an accurate way to predict the euv continuum level ; the low energy asymptotic slope ( @xmath72 ) is generally in agreement with the flat slope derived from the euv spectrum ( @xmath73 from tab.3 ) .",
    "+ note that in the case of pks  2155 - 304 there is an additional problem : the _ rosat _ spectral slope used for the extrapolation was not measured simulteneously to the euv spectrum and the spectral slope has been observed to harden when the source intensity increases ( giommi et al .",

    "we performed several fits using an absorbed power law model plus gaussian for all the observations .",
    "the results are listed in table  3 . in every case , except for the 1994 observation , the addition of a gaussian absorption line improves the fit .",
    "the power law slope is in the range @xmath74 $ ] which is not too distant from the slope measured from x - ray data , ( see e.g. guainazzi with sax data which gives @xmath75 depending on the spectral model ) .",
    "the best - fit center of the gaussian absorption lines is in the 71 - 75 range with full width half maximum varying from 0.2 to 6  .",
    "we note however that the 6   fwhm is relative to the global 1995 observation and it is probably due to the superposition of narrower slightly variable lines .",
    "ever since _ einstein",
    "_ pioneering observations suggested the existence of an ubiquitous absorption feature around @xmath76 kev in the x - ray spectra of bl lacertae objects ( canizares & kruper 1984 , madejski et al .",

    "1995 ) . extrapolating the _ rosat _ x - ray spectral slope into the euv the authors found evidence of a wide absorption feature from @xmath83 to @xmath84  and interpreted it as the superposition of doppler - smeared absorption lines ( l - shell transitions of mg and ne as well as m - shell transitions of fe ) that originate in a high - velocity clumped outflow from the nucleus . according to this model the x - ray line spectrum should be dominated by an o  vii k@xmath28 broadened and blueshifted feature .",

    "the implied ionization state of the gas would require stronger o  vii absorption in the x - ray range than is allowed by observations and the authors invoke subcosmic oxygen abundance to explain its absence .",
    "our analysis of the 1994 , 1995 and 1996 _ euve _ spectra of shows an absorption feature inferred directly from the  data , ( i.e. by modelling the euv continuum and the absorption line simultaneously ) . the simplest model for this feature",
    "is a reverted gaussian at about 71 - 75  a maximum fwhm of the order of few  . in order to investigate likely absorption features in a bl lac environment , we ran photoionization equilibrium models ( nicastro  1999 , nicastro  2000 ) which include the strongest 300 emission and resonant absorption lines down to 50 ev ( oscillator strength @xmath95 ) .",
    "we find that the predicted wavelengths and strengths of the absorption lines , both absolute and relative , are highly sensitive to the properties of the photoionizing continuum and the absorbing gas ( e.g. the ionization state and the assumed outflowing velocity ) .",
    "the number of transitions in the model also has a strong effect .",

    "the equivalent width of the lines is too small to give significant detections , however , especially in the euv regime , the presence of many fainter satellite lines ( not included in the model ) could explain the observed feature for example between the si vi line ( @xmath98  ) and the mg vi complex ( @xmath99  ) , both included in the model , at least 15 additional lines from ionized fe , al , be and ne are not included ( oscillator strength 0.01 - 0.1 ) and could be important especially if the elements are abundant .    even though no strong absorption line seem to be visible in the x - ray spectrum , we note that both in the 1979 _ einstein _ data ( madejski et al .",
