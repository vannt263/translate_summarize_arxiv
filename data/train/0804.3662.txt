    "discerning possible candidates for measuring distances between quantum states is a subject of perennial interest .",
    "many of these measures were first defined as distances between probability distributions and subsequently employed as distance - measures in hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath0 be the hilbert space associated with a quantum system and let @xmath1 be the set of all states , i.e. the set of self - adjoint , ( semi)positive and trace - one operators .",
    "a frequently employed notion of distance between quantum states is the relative entropy , which is a natural extension to the realm of quantum mechanics of the kullback - leibler divergence .",
    "this quantity , however , is not useful for ascertaining the degree of purification of an arbitrary state with respect to a pure reference state .",
    "the relative entropy of an operator @xmath2 , with respect to an operator @xmath3 , both belonging to @xmath4 , is given by @xmath5,\\label{relative - entropy}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 stands for logarithm in base two .",
    "@xmath7 is nonnegative and vanishes if and only if @xmath8 , being nonsymmetric and unbounded .",
    "a particular and important requirement indicates that the relative entropy is well defined only when the support of @xmath3 is equal to or larger than that of @xmath2 .",
    "otherwise , it is defined to be @xmath9 @xcite ( the support of an operator is the subspace spanned by its eigenvectors with non - zero eigenvalues ) . to overcome this restriction",
    "we have introduced a distance between elements of @xmath1 that shares with the relative entropy several of their main properties but that is always well defined and bounded @xcite .",
    "this distance is the quantum jensen - shannon divergence ( qjsd ) , which is a quantum mechanical extension of the jensen - shannon divergence ( jsd ) introduced by rao @xcite and lin @xcite as a distance between probability distribution ( for a detailed analysis of the properties of the jsd , see reference @xcite ) . here",
    "we wish to investigate the ability of the qjsd to serve as a measure of the degree of entanglement .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section we review the basic properties of the qjsd . in section 3",
    "we study its properties as an entanglement measure and we apply it to quantify the degree of entanglement of different families of two - qubit mixed states . finally , some conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "we define the qjsd in the fashion @xcite @xmath10 , \\label{relative - entropy}\\ ] ] which can be also recast in terms of the von neumann entropy @xmath11 as follows @xmath12 this quantity has a lot to speak for , being positive , null iff @xmath8 , symmetric , bounded , and always well defined .",
    "in fact , the restriction imposed on the supports of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the relative entropy ( [ relative - entropy ] ) is lifted for the qjsd , that possesses all the adequate properties of a proper distance between states in a hilbert space .",
    "as stated above , in this work we attempt to study the qjsd as an entanglement measure which justifies listing the main qjsd properties .",
    "most of these properties are discussed and proved in ref .",
    "the list reads    * @xmath13 with the equality iff @xmath14 * unitary operations left js invariant , i.e. , @xmath15 . *",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 is the partial trace .",
    "* js is jointly convex @xmath18 , where the @xmath19 are positive real numbers such that @xmath20 . *",
    "@xmath21 for all positive mappings @xmath22 .",
    "* for any set of orthogonal projectors @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 , @xmath25 * @xmath26 where @xmath27 is any projector .",
    "the two last properties , which have not been discussed before , are verified by the relative entropy @xcite , and inherited by the qjsd .    in a recent work @xcite",
    "the metric character of the qjsd has been discussed .",
    "there it was formally proved for pure states , and checked numerically for mixed ones by performing monte carlo simulations .",
    "we can thus assert that the square root of the qjsd verifies the triangle inequality , as it does the square root of the jsd .",
    "entanglement constitutes a physical resource that lies at the heart of quantum information processes @xcite .",
    "quantum teleportation , superdense coding , and quantum computation , are some of the most representative examples .",
    "let us recall that a state of a composite quantum system is called entangled if it can not be expressed as a convex sum of factorizable pure states . otherwise , the state is called separable .",
    "nowadays a variety of measures are used to quantify the degree of entanglement .",
    "these include the entanglement of distillation , the relative entropy of entanglement , etc .",
    "the canonical measure of entanglement in a bipartite pure systems is the so - called entanglement of formation , which is a strictly monotonic function of the squared concurrence . for simplicity",
    "the entanglement of formation is frequently used as _ the _ measure of entanglement . however , for mixed state there exist several available measures .    before starting with the entanglement - characterization using the qjsd we study the structure of hilbert space ( hs ) according to this distance measure . to do",
    "that we evaluate @xmath28 between a given random generated state and the maximally mixed ( mm ) state @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the hs - dimension . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the probability distribution for finding an arbitrary state @xmath2 at a given distance from the @xmath31 .",
    "we find , as expected , that the mean value of such distance increases for higher hilbert space - dimensions .",
    "let us now enumerate the properties that any adequate measure of entanglement should satisfy @xcite :    * discrimination : @xmath32 is separable .",
    "* monotonicity : the measure does not increase under local general measurements and classical communication , for every completely positive map @xmath22 , @xmath33 * convexity : @xmath34 , with @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "as it was already stated , the main purpose of the present communication is to investigate the qjsd as a _ geometrical _ measure of entanglement .",
    "following vedral _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite we define an entanglement measure @xmath36 as the minimum qjsd from the state @xmath2 to the set @xmath37 of the disentangled states .",
    "@xmath38 the qjsd properties enunciated in the preceding section ensure that ( [ js - entanglement ] ) fulfills the conditions for an adequate entanglement measure . for convenience s sake",
    ", we normalize the entanglement measure by a trivial re - scaling in order to adequately compare different quantities of interest , i.e. , @xmath39    it is notheworthy to stress that expression ( [ js - entanglement ] ) has already been investigated for different distances , other than the js - one .",
    "for example , vedral and coworkers used to this effect the relative entropy ( @xmath40 ) and the bures metric ( @xmath41 ) @xcite . also the trace - distance and",
    "the hilbert - schmidt metric have received consideration for the purpose @xcite .",
    "we shall below use as a reference the quantity @xmath41 .         induced by the bures metric .",
    "the task is accomplished for ( a ) werner , ( b ) mem , and ( c ) pdc states . ]    in order to investigate the behavior of the qjsd as an entanglement measure we consider now three well - known families of two - qubits mixed states , namely ,    * werner ones @xcite , * maximally entangled mixed ones @xcite ( mem ) , and * parametric down - conversion @xcite ( pdc ) states .    all of these are diagonal in the bell basis .",
    "we perform an optimization procedure so as to find the separable state that lies in the closest proximity to the state of interest @xmath2 .",
    "such task is performed by following a simulated annealing minimization procedure , starting from the maximally mixed state @xmath31 .",
    "appropriately perturbing @xmath31 we look for the minimal qjsd between @xmath2 and some state in @xmath42 .    in fig.2",
    "we depict , versus the linear entropy @xmath43 ( the degree of impurity ) , i ) the concurrence and the two normalized quantities : ii ) our @xmath44 and iii ) vedral s @xmath45 measure .",
    "this is done for the three families enumerated above .",
    "notice that the concurrence and @xmath45 are greater than @xmath44 , except for the  extreme \" cases of maximally entangled or disentangled bell states in two of the sub - figures . in the mems",
    "- instance this is not entirely so . crossings are detected between @xmath45 and the concurrence @xmath46 , although the @xmath47curve lies always below the other two for all the three families , except for the extreme ( trivial ) situations .",
    "the behavior here described mimics that of the relative entropy vs. @xmath43 . in that instance , the relative entropy - induced entanglement is strictly smaller than that of formation , as analytically demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "our crucial point is the fact that the measure induced by the qjsd is easier to compute than that induced by the bures metric .",
    "this is so because of the square root in the definition of bures metric , which forces cumbersome matrix - diagonalization and basis changes in order to compute @xmath45 .",
    "instead , so as to calculate the qjsd one i ) only needs to solve the eingenvalue - equation for three matrices ( eigenvectors are not necessary ) and ii ) the optimization procedure is much more efficient than in the bures situation .",
    "we have here advanced a new entanglement - measure @xmath44 , based on the jensen - shannon distance . for three important families of states",
    "this new quantity behaves in rather similar fashion as the established entanglement - measure @xmath45 of vedral _ et al .",
    "_ , with an important difference : the former is much more easy to compute than the later .",
