    "lattice qcd studies are making tremendous progress in resolving the excitation spectrum of qcd @xcite . by the nature of the finite - volume and euclidean time aspects of the lattice formulation ,",
    "it is impossible to directly simulate scattering processes .",
    "the established way to extract of scattering information from lattice simulations is the lscher method @xcite . for the case of elastic 2-body scattering",
    ", lscher identified that the finite volume eigenstates are uniquely determined in terms of the on - shell scattering parameters ( up to exponentially suppressed corrections associated with quantum fluctuations of the lightest degrees of freedom in the system ) .",
    "while the spectrum is determined uniquely , there are technical challenges associated with inverting a given lattice spectrum to determine scattering observables .",
    "one of these issues arises from the fact that the full rotational group is broken down by the geometry of the lattice boundary conditions . as a consequence ,",
    "partial wave mixing is unavoidable in lattice simulations and eigenstates on the finite volume do not correspond to definite eigenstates of the continuum rotation group .",
    "there has been significant work in previous years addressing this issue , eg .",
    "refs .  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we focus our attention of the study of inelastic scattering channels .",
    "the generalisation of the lscher formalism to incorporate inelastic channels was developed by he , feng and liu @xcite , and continues to be the topic of considerable further investigations and extensions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the issue of partial wave mixing , coupled - channel systems are further complicated by the multi - component nature of the @xmath1-matrix .",
    "for example , neglecting the angular momentum mixing , for the case of two coupled channels on a given volume , a single energy eigenstate is related to three asymptotic scattering parameters ( i.e. two phase shifts and an inelasticity ) .",
    "therefore the only way to uniquely identify all three parameters would be to search for near- coincident energy eigenstates at either different volumes or with different momentum boosts of the system @xcite . in practice ,",
    "such a `` pointwise '' extraction is only anticipated to have limited applicability .",
    "alternatively , one requires some form of interpolation which can reproduce the scattering parameters with a limited set of lattice simulation results . in the present work ,",
    "we extend a recently developed finite - volume hamiltonian formalism @xcite to a coupled - channel system . the necessary equivalence with the lscher formalism",
    "is numerically established .",
    "further , we investigate the inversion problem of extracting the phase shifts and inelasticity from a finite set of pseudo lattice data .",
    "we find that all three scattering parameters can be reliably reproduced by directly constraining the parameters of the model to the finite volume spectra . in the energy region constrained by the fits ,",
    "the extracted phase shifts and inelasticity show only a mild sensitivity to the precise form of the model .    to facilitate the exploration of lqcd spectra",
    ", our analysis is based upon a two - channel hamiltonian formulation which is constructed by fitting the available @xmath0 scattering phase shifts data in the @xmath2 partial waves .",
    "the explicit channels included are @xmath0 and the inelasticity associated with @xmath3 production . with the present manuscript being focussed primarily on the influence of the inelastic channel",
    ", we do not consider the issues associated with angular momentum mixing .",
    "in section ii , we write down a multi - channel formulation for constructing several model hamiltonians from fitting the @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "the model with only the @xmath0 channel is used in section iii to recall the finite - box hamiltonian method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and to examine the correspondence with lscher s formula . in section iv",
