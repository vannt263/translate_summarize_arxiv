    "quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions ( qed@xmath0 ) has attracted much interest over the past few years .",
    "it has many features similar to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , such as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the chiral limit and confinement @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is super - renormalizable , so it does not suffer from the ultraviolet divergence which are present in qed@xmath1 .",
    "because of these reasons it can serve as a toy model of qcd . in parallel with its relevance as a tool through which to develop insight into aspects of qcd , qed@xmath0 is also found to be equivalent to the low - energy effective theories of strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "recently , qed@xmath0 has been proved to be a useful tool to study antiferromagnetic spin correlation in the so - called staggered flux liquid phase in high t@xmath2 cuprate superconductor theory where the fermions are described by massless dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) occurs when the massless fermion acquires a nonzero mass through nonperturbative effects at low energy , but the lagrangian keeps chiral symmetry when the fermion mass is zero .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) provide a natural framework within which to explore dcsb and related phenomena .",
    "it is well known that in massless qed@xmath0 dcsb occurs when the number of fermion flavors @xmath3 is less than a critical number @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "recently , by numerically solving the dses in the chiral symmetric phase of @xmath5 , fischer et al . display the anomalous dimension of the fermion vector dressing function in the infrared domain for the case of bare vertex .",
    "they find that the wave - function renormalization has a power law behavior in the infrared region in wigner phase while the fermion vector dressing function has no power law behavior in nambu phase @xcite .",
    "it is shown that there exist antiferromagnetic correlations in the underdoped cuprates . in usual , one use the spin susceptibility to represent antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the theoretical calculations of the spin susceptibility are usually done in the framework of perturbation theory where nonperturbation effect is neglected . in this paper",
    ", we will study the staggered spin susceptibility in the framework of the dyson - schwinger approach and the effect of gauge boson mass on the staggered spin susceptibility .",

    "working beyond the mean - field level and including gauge fluctuations , rantner and wen calculated the nonzero leading @xmath17 order corrections to the staggered spin correlation function and obtain @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the nonzero anomalous dimension @xcite , which deduce the recovery to antiferromagnetic correlation at low energy .    up to now , in all the above literature",

    "when @xmath71 , the system enters the superconducting state and the boson field develops a finite expectation value @xmath72 , then the local gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and the gauge field acquires a finite mass @xmath64 after absorbing the massless goldstone boson .",
    "the finite gauge field mass is able to characterize the achievement of superconductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "the gauge mass obtains a mass via anderson - higgs mechanism implies that the gauge field is in confinement phase @xcite , which deduce that the spions and holons are confined in superconducting phase ( the spin - charge recombination ) .",
    "it is clear that the spinon and holon can not be observed in high-@xmath73 superconducting experiments , however , a well defined quasiparticle can be observed due to the spin - charge recombination in superconducting phase .    in qed@xmath20 with abelian higgs model the gauge field couples to both the fermion field @xmath74 and the complex scalar boson field @xmath66 .",

    "( 23 ) has two qualitatively distinct solutions .",
    "the `` nambu '' solution , for which @xmath88 , describes a phase in which ( a ) chiral symmetry is dynamically broken , because one has a nonzero fermion mass function , and ( b ) the dressed fermions are confined , because the propagator described by these functions does not have a lehmann representation .",
    "the alternative `` wigner '' solution , for which @xmath89 describes a phase in which chiral symmetry is not broken and the dressed fermions are not confined .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that bc1 vertex ansatz violates the fundamental qed ward identity , namely @xmath90 . if the ward identity is not satisfied , then the transversality of the photon self - energy is also compromised ( @xmath91 ought to vanish , but it does not ) .",
    "a better ansatz is given in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , this particular pathology is not easy to detect at the level of eq .",
    "( 24 ) , because we have suppressed the tensorial structure of the photon self - energy , keeping only the scalar form factor @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , the bc1 vertex has the advantage that the equations are simplified significantly and it already contains main qualitative features of the solution employing the bc vertex in the infrared region , as was demonstrated by the numerical calculations given in refs . [ 6,12 ] .",
    "this is the main reason why we still choose the bc1 vertex in our work .",
    "it is well known that one can obtain two types of solution by iterating the above coupled dses , the nambu solution and the wigner solution . after solving the above coupled dses by means of iteration method",
    ", we can numerically calculate the integration in eq .",
    "( 16 ) in both nambu phase and wigner phase .",
    "because of the importance of anomalous dimension exponent for the staggered spin susceptibility @xcite , we firstly study the momentum dependence of @xmath50 in the infrared region for several gauge boson mass for n=2 . in fig .",
    "2 , the dependence of @xmath50 on the momentum for several values of the gauge boson mass are shown . from the obtained numerical results one finds that in wigner phase @xmath50 enhances when the gauge boson mass monotonically increases , while in nambu phase it decreases with the increase of the gauge boson mass .",
    "it is well known that when the gauge boson mass is zero , the vector dressing function @xmath50 in wigner phase has a power law behavior in the infrared region @xcite . from fig .",
    "2 , it is clear that the anomalous dimension exponent will change for several gauge boson mass since these curves are not parallel in infrared region .",
    "however , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite still use the same anomalous dimension exponent @xmath19 to study the staggered spin susceptibility when the gauge boson mass is nonzero .     on the momentum for several gauge boson mass @xmath64 in wigner phase and nambu phase , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   on the momentum for several gauge boson mass @xmath64 in wigner phase and nambu phase , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    on the other hand , the difference between @xmath50 in wigner phase and nambu phase is more and more smaller as the gauge boson mass increases from fig .",

    "the staggered spin susceptibility is used to represent the antiferromagnetic order in qed@xmath0 model . on the other hand ,",
    "the gauge boson mass is proportional to the superfluid density , so the gauge boson mass can be used to describe the superconducting order . due to the competition between the antiferromagnetic order and the superconducting order in high temperature cuprate superconductors , it is obvious that the opening of a gap in the gauge fluctuations will spoil the antiferromagnetic correlation .     in the low energy limit for several",
    "gauge boson masses , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    from the large momentum behavior of @xmath50 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , we see that the staggered spin susceptibility given by eq .",
    "( 16 ) is linearly divergent , and this divergence can not be eliminated through the standard renormalization procedure . in order to extract something meaningful from the staggered spin correlation , one needs to subtract the linear divergence of the free staggered spin susceptibility from eq .",
    "( 16 ) , which is analogous to the regularization procedure for calculating the chiral susceptibility in qcd , which is quadratically divergent ( see for example , ref .",
    "we define the regularized staggered spin susceptibility by @xmath96 where the free staggered spin susceptibility @xmath97 is calculated at the mean field level .    the numerical result for the staggered spin susceptibility for @xmath98 case is given in fig .",
    "we find that the gauge boson mass suppresses the staggered spin susceptibility in the low energy limit in wigner phase . on the contrary , the staggered spin susceptibility increase with the gauge boson mass increasing in nambu phase .",
    "when the value of the gauge boson mass reaches 0.024 , the staggered spin susceptibility takes the same value in nambu phase and wigner phase .",
    "once the gauge boson mass exceeds this critical value , nambu phase disappears . here",
    "it should be noted that the imaginary part of staggered spin susceptibility is related to the scattering function which can be detected by experiment @xcite , therefore , in order to compare the staggered spin susceptibility with the related experiment , one should continue it into real frequencies ( more detail can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we will discuss this question in the near future .",
    "now we focus on the staggered spin susceptibility in winger phase .",
    "experimentally it has been proved that the staggered spin correlations decrease with the increase of the doping @xmath99 .",
    "rantner and wen have explained the unusual property based on the algebraic spin liquid plus the spin - charge recombination picture @xcite .",
    "in fact , this strange experimental behavior can be explained naturally in our paper . at zero temperature ,",
    "the superfluid density in the underdoping region depends on the doping @xmath99 as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the lattice spacing @xcite . as the doping @xmath99 increases , the superfluid density increases .",
    "since the gauge boson mass is proportional to the superfluid density , it also increases when the doping @xmath99 increases .",
    "that is to say , the staggered susceptibility decreases with the increase of the doping . on the other hand",
    ", it is shown that the gauge boson mass suppresses the staggered spin susceptibility in the low energy limit in fig .",
    "4 . our results in wigner phase give a qualitative physical picture on the competition and coexistence between the antiferromagnetic order ( the staggered spin susceptibility ) and the superconducting orders ( the gauge boson mass ) in high temperature cuprate superconductors .",
    "on the contrary , the staggered spin susceptibility increase with the gauge boson mass increasing in nambu phase .",
    "the conclusion in winger phase fail to show the true physical picture .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to investigate the effect of the gauge boson mass on the staggered spin susceptibility .",
    "based on the linear response theory of the fermion propagator in the presence of an external scalar field , we first derive a model - independent integral formula , which expresses the staggered spin susceptibility in terms of objects of the basic quantum field theory : dressed propagator and vertex .",
    "when one approximates the scalar vertex function by the bare one , this expression , which includes the influence of the nonperturbative dressing effects , reduces to the expression for the staggered spin susceptibility obtained using perturbation theory in previous works . then we calculate numerically the staggered spin susceptibility in both nambu phase and wigner phase when the gauge boson acquire a mass .",
    "it is found that when the gauge boson mass increases , the staggered spin susceptibility in wigner phase decreases , while the staggered spin susceptibility in nambu phase increases .",
    "when the gauge boson mass reaches a critical value , nambu phase disappears .",
    "in addition , in winger phase , we also find that the superconducting order suppresses the antiferromagnetic order .",

    "<S> based on the study of the linear response of the fermion propagator in the presence of an external scalar field , we calculate the staggered spin susceptibility in the low energy limit in the framework of the dyson - schwinger approach . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the effect of a finite gauge boson mass on the staggered spin susceptibility in both nambu phase and wigner phase . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the gauge boson mass suppresses the staggered spin susceptibility in wigner phase . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we try to give an explanation for why the antiferromagnetic spin correlation increases when the doping is lowered .    </S>",
