    "this paper is the continuation of an ongoing project aimed at understanding pre - main sequence ( pms ) li burning . in previous works we have studied li in different types of pms stars : martn et al .",
    "( 1992 ) obtained li abundances for 5 post t tauri secondaries of early - type stars .",
    "martn & rebolo ( 1993 ) studied the pms secondary of the eclipsing binary ek  cep and derived its li abundance .",
    "martn et al .",
    "( 1994 ) presented li abundances for 53 `` weak '' t tauri stars ( wtts ) in taurus .",
    "they found a narrow peak in the li distribution centered at log n(li)@xmath5=3.1 , which is the initial li content of newly formed stars .",
    "they also found that pms li depletion is a strong function of mass and luminosity .",
    "garca lpez et al . (",
    "1994 ) derived li abundances for 24 pleiades stars and confirmed the presence of a li - rotation connection ( see also soderblom et al .",
    "1993 ) among the late - g and early k - type stars , but not among the late - k and early - m stars .",
    "such connection has been studied theoretically by martn & claret ( 1996 ) , who showed that rotation lowers the temperature at the base of the convection region and hence reduces the efficiency of pms li depletion",
    ". finally , zapatero - osorio et al . (",
    "1996 ) performed a search for li in very low mass ( m3m6 ) @xmath0  per stars with no positive li detection .    the ic  4665 open cluster offers the possibility of testing our current ideas about pms li burning because it may have an age of only @xmath235 myr ( mermilliod 1981 , but see the discussion in section 4.2 ) .",
    "its coordinates ( 17h40 m , + 5@xmath6 ) make it a suitable target from northern hemisphere observatories .",
    "its distance ( @xmath2350pc ) is almost a factor of 3 farther than the pleiades , and thus the cluster members are relatively faint .",
    "nevertheless , a list of reliable low mass members with v - magnitudes in the range 1214 has been released from proper motion and radial velocity studies ( prosser & giampapa 1994 ) .",
    "we selected for spectroscopic observations the 13 bona fide ic  4665 members with colors ( b - v)@xmath70.75 , i.e. spectral type g0 and later , given by prosser & giampapa .",
    "we added to this sample one early m - type photometric member from prosser ( 1993 ) .",
    "our spectra contain not only the lii@xmath16708  feature , but also h@xmath0  .",
    "the h@xmath0  emission excess is a fairly good indicator of chromospheric activity ( pasquini & pallavicini 1991 , montes et al .",
    "1995a ) , which in turn is connected to rotation via the dynamo mechanism . in the pleiades",
    "cluster the fast rotators present both high li abundance and high level of chromospheric activity ( soderblom et al .",
    "1993 , garca lpez et al .",
    "hence , there is a li - activity connection induced by rotation .",
    "we have tested if such connection also holds for the ic  4665 stars .",
    "all the programme stars , except p75 , were observed at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) with the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) during a four night run in august 1995 .",
    "we used the 235 mm camera , agred collimator , gratings r1200y and h1800v and a tek 1124x1124 ccd detector . for each star",
    "we give in table  1 the prosser ( 1993 ) number and v - magnitude , date of the observation , dispersion ( resolution @xmath2 2 pixels ) , and exposure time .",
    "one of the stars was observed with the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto observatory , using the twin spectrograph , t06 grating in the red arm and a tek chip .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     2truept note : the data was taken from stauffer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .",
    "the li abundances of the ic  2391 stars fall within the range of abundances of the ic  4665 and pleiades stars ( fig .  4 )",
    ". we can also compare with the post t tauri stars ( ptts ) studied by martn et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and martn ( 1993 )",
    ". the estimated ages of ptts are 2050 myr , and the li abundances for 9 ptts are in the range log n(li)=3.3  1.8 , their t@xmath8   ranging from 5900  k to 4400  k. the degree of li depletion among the ptts is similar than among the ic  2391 , ic  4665 , @xmath0 per and the pleiades stars , indicating that either the ptts and the 4 open clusters share similar age distributions , or li is not sensitive for ages in the range @xmath2  20100  myr .",
    "the first interpretation would imply a rather large age spread within the low mass population of open clusters . on the other hand , the strong correlation of li with luminosity found by martn et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in wtts , indicates that pms li burning is very efficient during a short timescale .",
    "it is conceivable that the observed pattern of li abundances in ptts and young clusters is formed quite rapidly through pms convective mixing ( timescale of a few myr ) at an age of @xmath2 20 myr .",
    "theoretical models are qualitatively consistent with this scenario , because they predict a sudden drop in li abundance when the bottom of the convection region reaches high enough temperature for li burning , but as the star approaches the zams , convection becomes shallower and li depletion should slow down .",
    "however , it has been noted that theoretical models do not give yet a quantitative good description of the observed li abundances among pms stars ( martn et al .",
    "1994 , garca lpez et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in fig .",
    "4 , it can be seen that below t@xmath8  4000 k , li has not been detected in any star of the @xmath0  per and ic 4665 clusters .",
    "the upper limits imply very strong li depletions",
    ". however , as we move to lower masses , the internal temperatures diminish and we should reach a point where they are not high enough for li burning . hence , we should see li again in the very low mass cluster members .",
    "this effect has been proposed as a test for distinguishing between stars and brown dwarfs ( rebolo et al .",
    "1992 ; magazz et al . 1993 ) .",
    "very recently , li has been detected in the coolest known members of the pleiades ( basri et al .",
    "1996 , rebolo et al .",
    "1996 ) . for the age of the pleiades ( 70 - 120 myr ) , theoretical models predict that only brown dwarfs preserve lithium ( e.g. magazz et al .",
    "1993 ) , but for younger ages the very low mass stars also start to preserve it because they require a long time to contract .",
    "thus , we expect that in clusters younger than the pleiades , the reappearence of li should be shifted to higher masses .",
    "such an effect provides a precision clock for dating clusters .",
    "dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) suggested on the basis of their theoretical isochrones of li depletion that low luminosity stars could be used for dating open clusters .",
    "they also noted that the li depletion is quite sensitive to input physics of the models which have considerable uncertainties ( opacities , convection ) .",
    "hence , it may be difficult to use li to assign absolute ages to open clusters , but relative ages will probably be safe .",
    "what we call in this paper  ll - clock \" stands for lithium - luminosity clock .",
    "it is based on the high efficiency of li depletion for fully convective low luminosity objects .",
    "the age of a young cluster will be given by the most massive objects among the very low mass members in which li is seen to re - emerge , after having been efficiently depleted by higher mass cluster members . in the pleiades the li destruction ",
    "preservation borderline has been found at luminosity around log  l=-2.9  l@xmath9 ( basri et al . 1996 ) according to the li detection in the object ppl  15 . the traditional method for dating open clusters ,",
    "i.e. upper main - sequence turn off fitting , says that @xmath0per is younger by @xmath220  myr than the pleiades ( mermilliod 1981 ) . if ppl  15 were 20  myr younger , it luminosity would be about 0.12  dex larger ( dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) , and it should be slightly hotter and have higher li abundance .",
    "zapatero - osorio et al . (",
    "1996 ) have reported a negative li detection in ap  j0323 + 4853 , which has a luminosity around log  l=-2.6  l@xmath9 .",
    "this result does not rule out that @xmath0per is younger than the pleiades , but it shows how close the observations are to telling us very interesting things about the relative ages of the young clusters . in ic  4665 , it will be a little more difficult to investigate the very low - luminosity members , simply because of its larger distance , but if it is indeed younger than the pleiades , we expect that li should re - appear at higher luminosities .",
    "we have obtained high resolution spectra of 14 cool stars ( g0m1 ) in the open ic 4665 cluster . excess h@xmath0",
    "emission and li abundances have been derived from the data .",
    "we find a large spread in both parameters .",
    "the dependance of h@xmath0  and li with t@xmath8  in ic 4665 seems similar than in the pleiades .",
    "two ic 4665 stars ( p146 and p166 ) with lower h@xmath0  emission and li abundance than pleiades stars of the same t@xmath8  are suspects of not being cluster members , although their radial velocities do indicate membership .",
    "the li abundances of ic 4665 stars support previous conclusions on pms li burning ( martn et al .",
    "1994 ; garca lpez et al .",
    "1994 ) : solar type stars experience little pms li depletion ; late - g and early - k stars present a large spread of li abundances ( about 1 dex ) , which is related to activity and rotation in the sense that fast rotators have higher li abundance and chromospheric emission ; late - k and early - m stars experience very efficient li depletion , which is larger than a factor of 100 for t@xmath8  @xmath4 4000",
    "k.    the distribution of li abundances in the low mass stars of several open clusters ( ic  2391 , ic 4665 , @xmath0  per , pleiades ) , and in post  t  tauri stars , are rather similar .",
    "there can be two reasons for that : ( a ) the stars in different clusters and the ptts span the same range of ages , and ( b ) li and h@xmath0  are not precise age indicators between @xmath2 20 and 100 myr .",
    "we argue that relative ages of young clusters may be obtained in the near future using the  ll - clock \" .",
    "this would certainly help to clarify the evolution of li and chromospheric activity during late pms evolution .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank artemio herrero and the staff of the isaac newton telescope for helping us to carry out the observations .",
