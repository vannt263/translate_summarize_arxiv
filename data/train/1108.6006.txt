    "we present results of photographic observation of the hayabusa reentry from two temporary stations and two stations of the desert fireball network located in southwestern australia .",
    "all cameras used wide field ( fish - eye ) lenses and captured the artificial fireball produced by the reentry of hayabusa on single sheets of films .",
    "the desert network observatories are also equipped with all - sky radiometers measuring the fireball luminosity .",
    "standard astrometric and photometric procedures could be used to obtain the trajectory , velocity and brightness of the fireball . however , most of the spacecraft fragments were not resolved .",
    "only a few widely separated and bright enough fragments could be tracked individually .",
    "two temporary stations were set up in the desert of south australia by a ground observation team of the japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) @xcite to observe the re - entry .",
    "they were located to the north and to the south of the expected trajectory , respectively . among other instruments ,",
    "the stations were equipped by photographic cameras mamiya @xmath1 carrying the fish - eye lens @xmath2 mm , @xmath3 ( gos3 ) and @xmath4 mm @xmath5 ( gos4 ) and using fujifilm color 400 asa .",
    "the northern station coober pedy , designed gos4 and operated by y. kakinami and y. shiba , was equipped with a rotating shutter placed in front of the camera lens and producing 10 breaks per second for measuring the fireball velocity .",
    "the southern station tarcoola , gos3 , was operated by s. abe . at both stations",
    "the cameras were tilted from zenith toward the fireball trajectory ( by 33@xmath6 and 45@xmath6 , respectively ) .",
    "( , 1mm)australia2.eps    ( , 1mm)gos4.eps    ( 140mm,140mm)dfo2.eps    the desert fireball network ( dfn ) is located in the nullarbor plain in western australia and consists of four autonomous fireball observatories @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the network is to observe natural fireballs and possible meteorite falls .",
    "the observatories are equipped with zeiss distagon 3.5/30 mm fish - eye lenses , producing 8-cm - diameter all - sky images on ilford fp 125 black - and - white films .",
    "a rotating shutter is located inside of the cameras and produces 15 breaks per second .",
    "the radiometers based on photomultipliers measure the total brightness of the sky 500 times per second .    despite the relatively large range to the hayabusa trajectory ( 400600 km ) , all four stations of the dfn captured at least part of the fireball . in this paper",
    ", we use data from the two closest stations , dfo2 , forrest , and dfo4 , mundrabilla .",
    "the positions of the observing stations are shown in fig .",
    "[ map ] and listed in table  [ coord ] .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ peaks ]    ( , 1mm)magc.eps    the brightness of the capsule was measured on the gos3 image .",
    "the light curve was smooth with a broad maximum of @xmath7 mag between heights 5550 km .",
    "the measurements at larger heights are sparse and have large error because the proximity of the capsule trail to the bright spacecraft .    from the predicted apparent magnitudes of the capsule at different stations @xcite",
    ", it can be inferred that the predicted absolute ( 100 km distance ) brightness of the capsule was @xmath8 mag at a height of 50 km .",
    "the actual brightness was by 2 magnitudes ( factor of 6 ) lower .",
    "the expected brightness of the spacecraft was not published .",
    "our data confirm that the capsule re - entry trajectory predicted by jaxa was correct within few hundreds of meters .",
    "it is in agreement with the expected accuracy of the prediction , which was estimated to 500@xmath9200 m ( @xmath10 ) at a height of 50 km .",
    "the expected error in velocity , 30 m / s ( @xmath11 ) , seems to have been underestimated , since the observed deviation was 100 m / s .",
    "the spacecraft followed almost the same trajectory as the capsule , the most significant difference being that the spacecraft was about one kilometer higher at a given longitude .    to our knowledge ,",
    "our observation provided the first wide - field , multi - station photographic data for a re - entering object with good independent telemetry available .",
    "similar observation of the stardust re - entry used different techniques @xcite .",
    "our work provided an excellent validation of astrometric and reduction procedures used in fireball networks for determination of trajectories and velocities of natural fireballs .",
    "the hayabusa re - entry can be compared with the entries of natural meteoroids in several aspects : luminous efficiency , dynamic pressure acting at the moment of fragmentation , and apparent ablation coefficient .",
    "the integral luminous efficiency is defined as the ratio of the total radiated energy to the initial kinetic energy of the object . using the radiometric light curve ( fig .",
    "[ mag ] ) and taking into account that zero magnitude meteor radiates about 1500 w at all wavelengths to all directions @xcite , the total radiative output of the hayabusa fireball was determined to @xmath12 j. using the mass of the spacecraft of about 400 kg and the velocity , relative to the atmosphere , of 11.7 km / s , the luminous efficiency was found to be 1.3% .",
    "note that the used conversion from magnitudes to watts is valid for plasma temperature 4500  k. the actual temperatures inferred from hayabusa spectroscopy were in the range 4500  6000 k @xcite . for 6000",
    "k the radiative output and the luminous efficiency would be about 25% lower .    for natural fireballs ,",
    "the luminous efficiency is a poorly known parameter , which depends on meteoroid velocity , mass , and structure .",
    "the empirical formula of @xcite , based on more energetic events , predicts 4% for the hayabusa energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the formula of @xcite , valid for relatively small meteoroids , gives only 0.5% .",
    "@xcite gave the average luminous efficiency for type i fireballs 5.57% and for more fragile type ii fireballs 1.35% .",
    "we can therefore say that the luminous efficiency of hayabusa was in the range expected for natural fireballs of similar parameters .",
    "the total radiative output of the capsule was only @xmath13 j. the capsule lost only small part from its initial mass of about 20 kg during the re - entry , but it decelerated from 11.7 km / s to just few km / s during the ablation phase , so it deposited about @xmath14j into the atmosphere . only about 0.03% of this energy was radiated out .",
    "the low luminous efficiency was due to the special material used for the ablation shield .",
    "the spectroscopy revealed that the capsule spectrum was dominated at visible wavelengths by black body radiation of the capsule surface @xcite . without ablation products , no large radiating plasma envelope , which normally provides most luminosity of fireballs , developed around the capsule .    the dynamic pressure @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is atmospheric density and @xmath17 is velocity , acts on objects moving in the atmosphere .",
    "if the dynamic pressure exceeds the material strength , fragmentation occurs .",
    "fragmentation is often accompanied by a flare on the light curve .",
    "the last column of table  [ peaks ] lists the dynamic pressures at the flares during the hayabusa re - entry .",
    "the pressures are quite low and comparable only to the most fragile natural meteoroids of cometary origin @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising because the spacecraft was not a compact solid body but in fact a quite porous object .",
    "nevertheless , it may be surprising that no piece survived below 47 km .",
    "finally , the dynamics ( deceleration ) of fireballs can be fitted using the classical meteor equations @xcite .",
    "the most interesting parameters of the fit are the ablation coefficient , @xmath18 , and the combination @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the drag coefficient and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are meteoroid shape coefficient , bulk density , and mass , respectively .",
    "the dynamic mass of the meteoroid can therefore be determined if we know or assume @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the typical ablation coefficient of natural fireballs varies from 0.014 s@xmath24/km@xmath24 for not - so - much fragmenting type i fireballs to about 0.2 s@xmath24/km@xmath24 for the most fragile type iiib fireballs @xcite .",
    "we fitted the dynamics of the capsule and spacecraft fragments b and c. for the capsule , we obtained @xmath25 s@xmath24/km@xmath24 , a very low value , which is , nevertheless , understandable for a specially designed re - entry object . for fragment",
    "b , we got @xmath26 s@xmath24/km@xmath24 and for fragment c extremely high @xmath27 s@xmath24/km@xmath24 .",
    "the resulting @xmath28 for the capsule can be separated , for example , into the following reasonable values : @xmath29 , @xmath30 g/@xmath31 and @xmath32 kg ( almost constant mass ) . for fragments",
    "b and c we have no idea about their shape and density . they may in fact represent clouds of small fragments . formally , we assumed @xmath33 and @xmath34 g/@xmath31 for both b and c. then the mass of b was 0.12 kg at the height of 58 km .",
    "such mass , however , can not explain the observed high luminosity .",
    "either there were more fragments or the density was about 10 times lower and mass 100 times higher .",
    "for c , we obtained 12 kg at 58.5 km , which can provide the observed luminosity at that point .",
    "however , the computed mass was rapidly decreasing toward the lower heights while the luminosity remained high .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained if the object was continuously flattened by the ablation , i.e.  the shape coefficient was changing .    _",
