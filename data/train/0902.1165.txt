    "this paper concerns finite approximations of the following boundary value problem : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a given ( small ) number , @xmath7 @xmath8 is a bounded domain with piecewise smooth boundary @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denotes the unit outward normal to @xmath11 . as @xmath12 is the well - known ( @xmath13-d ) wave operator , we shall call @xmath2 the bi - wave operator throughout this paper .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath14 hence , equation is a fourth order pde , which can be viewed as a singular perturbation of the poisson equation by the bi - wave operator . as a comparison",
    ", we recall that the biharmonic operator @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 although there is only a sign difference in the mixed derivative term , the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath2 is fundamental because @xmath15 is an elliptic operator while @xmath2 is a hyperbolic operator .",
    "superconductors are materials that have no resistance to the flow of electricity when the surrounding temperature is below some critical temperature . at the superconducting state , the electrons are believed to ",
    "team up pairwise \" despite the fact that the electrons have negative charges and normally repel each other .",
    "the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite has been well accepted as a good mean field theory for low ( critical temperature ) @xmath17 superconductors @xcite . however",
    ", a theory to explain high @xmath17 superconductivity still eludes modern physics . in spite of the lack of satisfactory microscopic theories and models , various generalizations of the ginzburg - landau - type models to account for high @xmath17 properties such as the anisotropy and the inhomogeneity",
    "have been proposed and developed . in low @xmath17 superconductors ,",
    "electrons are thought to pair in a form in which the electrons travel together in spherical orbits , but in opposite directions .",
    "such a form of pairing is often called @xmath18-wave @xcite . however , in high @xmath17 superconductors , experiments have produced strong evidence for @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry in which the electrons travel together in orbits resembling a four - leaf clover ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "recently , the @xmath0-wave pairing has gained substantial support over @xmath18-wave pairing as the mechanism by which high - temperature superconductivity might be explained . in generalizing the ginzburg - landau models to high @xmath17 superconductors ,",
    "the key idea is to introduce multiple order parameters in the ginzburg - landau free energy functional",
    ". these models , which can also be derived from the phenomenological gorkov equations @xcite , have built a reasonable basis upon which detailed studies of the fine vortex structures in some high @xmath17 materials have become possible .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein for a detailed exposition on modeling and analysis of @xmath0-wave superconductors .    we obtain equation from the ginzburg - landau - type @xmath0-wave model considered in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) in absence of applied magnetic field by neglecting the zeroth order nonlinear terms but retaining the leading terms . in the equation , @xmath19 ( notation @xmath20",
    "is instead used in the cited references ) denotes the @xmath0-wave _ order parameter_. we note that the original order parameter @xmath20 in the ginzburg - landau - type model @xcite is a complex - valued scalar function whose magnitude represents the density of superconducting charge carriers , however , to reduce the technicalities and to present the ideas , we assume @xmath19 is a real - valued scalar function in this paper and remark that the finite element methods developed in this paper can be easily extended to the complex case .",
    "we also note that the parameter @xmath21 appears in the full model as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is proportional to the ratio @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the critical temperatures of the @xmath18-wave and @xmath0-wave components .",
    "clearly , @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) when @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) as @xmath32 .",
    "hence , @xmath21 is expected to be small for @xmath0-wave like superconductors .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to develop conforming finite element methods for the reduced @xmath0-wave model .",
    "since the bi - wave term is the leading term in the full @xmath0-wave model , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) , any good numerical method for should be applicable to the full @xmath0-wave model .",
    "it is easy to see that the energy space for the bi - wave equation is @xmath33 ( see section [ prelim ] ) .",
    "our main task then is to construct finite element subspaces @xmath34 of the energy space @xmath35 which should be as simple as possible but also rich enough to have good approximation properties . to this end",
    ", we note that @xmath36 , and hence , the desired finite element space @xmath34 should satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath35 is a proper subspace of @xmath39 , the condition @xmath40 does not guarantee that @xmath41 .",
    "hence , @xmath42 ( lagrange ) finite element spaces are in general not subspaces of @xmath35 .",
    "an intriguing question is what extra conditions are required to make a @xmath42 finite element space to be a subspace of @xmath35 . to answer this question , on noting that @xmath43",
    ", one may choose @xmath34 such that @xmath44 , that is , @xmath34 is a @xmath45 finite element space such as argyris finite element space ( cf .",
    "* chapter 6 ) ) .",
    "trivially , @xmath46 .",
    "it turns out ( see section [ sec-3 ] ) such a choice would work since it can be shown that the finite element solution so defined converges with optimal rate in the energy norm of @xmath35 .",
    "however , since @xmath45 finite elements require either the use of fifth or higher order polynomials with up to second order derivatives as degrees of freedom @xcite , or the use of exotic elements ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) , it is expensive and less efficient to solve the bi - wave equation using @xmath45 finite elements .",
    "this then motivates us to construct low order non-@xmath45 finite elements which give genuine subspaces of @xmath35 and to develop other types of finite element methods such as nonconforming and discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ prelim ] contains some preliminaries and the functional setting for the bi - wave problem .",
    "well - posedness of the problem and regularity estimates of the weak solution are established . because @xmath2 is a hyperbolic operator , the usual regularity shift for fourth order elliptic problems does not hold for the bi - wave problem , instead , a weaker shifting  rule \" only holds .",
    "section [ sec-2 ] devotes to construction and analysis of piecewise polynomial subspaces of @xmath35 .",
    "first , we give a characterization of such subspaces .",
    "it is proved that a subspace of @xmath35 is  necessarily \" a @xmath45 finite element space on a general mesh . however , non-@xmath45 finite elements are possible on restricted meshes .",
    "second , we construct two such finite elements .",
    "the first one is a cubic element and the second is a quartic element .",
    "third , we establish the approximation properties for both proposed finite elements . because both elements are not affine families , a technique of using affine relatives ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is used to carry out the analysis .",
    "finally , optimal order error estimates in the energy norm of @xmath35 are proved for the finite element approximations of problem  using the proposed finite elements .",
    "suboptimal ( and optimal in some cases ) order error estimates in the @xmath4-norm are also derived using a duality argument . in section [ sec-3 ]",
    "we present some numerical experiment results to gauge the efficiency of the proposed finite element methods and also to validate our theoretical error bounds .",
    "standard space notation is adopted in this paper .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for their exact definitions . in addition",
    ", @xmath47 and @xmath48 are used to denote the @xmath4-inner products on @xmath49 and on @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "@xmath50 denotes a generic @xmath51 and @xmath21-independent positive constant .",
    "we also introduce the following special space notation : @xmath52 it is easy to verify that @xmath53 is an inner product on @xmath35 , hence , @xmath54 is the induced norm , and @xmath35 endowed with this inner product is a hilbert space .",
    "we remark that all above claims do not hold in general if the harmonic term @xmath55 is dropped in because the kernels of the bi - wave operator @xmath2 and the wave operator @xmath12 may contain non - zero functions satisfying the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the variational formulation of  can be derived easily by testing against a test function @xmath56 and using integration by parts formulas .",
    "specifically , it is defined as seeking @xmath57 such that @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denotes the pairing between @xmath35 and its dual , @xmath61 .",
    "we now show that problem is well - posed .",
    "[ thm2.1 ] for any @xmath62 , there exists a unique solution to .",
    "furthermore , there holds estimate @xmath63    we note for @xmath64 , @xmath65 is a hilbert space with the inner product @xmath53 .",
    "the estimate follows from and after setting @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we note @xmath68 is a proper subspace of @xmath35 , so in general @xmath69 if @xmath62 .",
    "however , for smoother function @xmath70 we have the following regularity results .",
    "[ regularity_thm ] assume that the boundary @xmath9 of the domain @xmath49 is sufficiently smooth .",
    "let @xmath71 be two nonnegative integers .",
    "then there exist constants @xmath72 such that the weak solution @xmath19 of satisfies @xmath73    first , we consider the case that @xmath19 and @xmath70 have compact support .",
    "let @xmath74 and @xmath75 . because equation is a linear equation , differentiating the equation immediately verifies that @xmath76 and @xmath77 satisfy @xmath78 that is",
    ", @xmath76 is a solution of the bi - wave equation with the source term @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath19 is assumed to have a compact support , then @xmath76 also satisfies the homogeneous boundary conditions in .",
    "thus , it follows from theorem [ thm2.1 ] that @xmath79 which gives with @xmath80 .    to show , it suffices to prove that @xmath81 which is equivalent to prove that holds for @xmath82 . to this end , testing with @xmath83 yields @xmath84 using the following integral identity @xmath85 followed by using green s identity ( for @xmath86 ) in the first term on the left hand side",
    "we get @xmath87 here , we have dropped the boundary integral terms because @xmath76 has a compact support .    combining the above two identities for @xmath76 and using schwarz inequality yield @xmath88 hence , the above inequality and",
    "imply that holds with @xmath89 .",
    "second , in the case @xmath19 and @xmath70 do not have compact support , it is clear that @xmath76 and @xmath77 still satisfy .",
    "however , @xmath76 and its derivatives may not satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions in . to get around this difficulty ,",
    "the well - known tricks are to use the cutoff function technique ( see @xcite ) for interior estimates and to use the flattening boundary technique for boundary estimates .",
    "the cutoff function technique involves testing by @xmath90 and @xmath91 , instead of @xmath76 and @xmath83 , for a smooth cutoff function @xmath92 .",
    "integrating by parts on the left hand side and using schwarz inequality and the properties of the cutoff function then yield the desired interior estimate similar to and .",
    "the flattening boundary technique involves locally mapping the curved boundary into a flat boundary by a smooth map ( this requires the smoothness of the boundary @xmath9 ) .",
    "after the desired boundary estimates are obtained in the new coordinates , they are then transferred to the solution @xmath76 in the original coordinates .",
    "we omit the technical derivations and refer the interested reader to @xcite for a detailed exposition of these techniques applying to other linear pdes .",
