    "the origin of heaviness of the third generation particles and its possible connection to physics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) are still mysterious .",
    "nevertheless , many candidates of new physics generically end up with either preferential couplings to the third generation or light partners of third generation .",
    "for example , top quark condensation and its mass are directly tied to electroweak scale dynamics in top - color models , and top partners are present and possibly lighter than other partners in the supersymmetry and little higgs models .",
    "an extreme case is when new physics couples only to the third generation .",
    "this raises a challenge in discovering such physics at the collider because they are not produced directly from colliding partons / leptons .",
    "a gluon , not being a fermion , is an exception to this discussion , and can couple to colored new particles .",
    "however , such interaction vertices involve two or more new particles at leading order , which then are only produced in pairs in simple processes .",
    "meanwhile , a warped extra dimensional randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite is a promising theory that attempts to explain the large hierarchy between planck scale and weak scale .",
    "exponentially warped background geometry is responsible for the huge difference of mass scales between two 4d spaces of moderate distance along the extra dimension .",
    "the warped space in the rs model has been further feted by its ability to generate the flavor hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson , being localized on the ir brane , feels only the exponentially warped tail of the bulk wave functions of uv localized fields . by properly localizing fermions , a wide range for the fermion mass spectrum",
    "can be obtained with anarchic yukawa couplings .",
    "however , this flavor dependence inevitably induces flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) mediated by kaluza - klein ( kk ) gauge bosons , and the rs model of this type generically in conflict with precise measurements of flavor physics .",
    "the strongest among them , for example , are from cp violation @xmath3 of the @xmath4 system which requires the mass of kk states to be @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "when the higgs is in the bulk , bounds from @xmath3 and @xmath6 of the @xmath7 process can be relieved to be @xmath8 @xcite which is still well above the electroweak scale and beyond the collider reach if the anarchic yukawa approach is pursued .",
    "on the other hand , if one s highest priority is first and foremost to explain the planck - weak hierarchy , the rs model can be made much more compatible with flavor measurements by assuming @xmath9 is the usual one , and matches , for example , that given in ref .",

    "flavor universality in the rh down sector is very useful to make the theory consistent with @xmath3 measurements with mildly heavy @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this is made possible by getting rid of the chiral enhanced left - right mixed current contributions to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the geometric approach to the flavor hierarchy , there still exists some tension with several flavor observables that hover around the current bounds .",
    "another class of flavor structure is to align bulk masses with proper combinations of anarchic yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "the desired degree of alignment in the down - sector can be achieved by some bulk flavor symmetries @xcite , and the flavor bound is as low as the bound obtained from generic electroweak precision test ( ewpt ) @xmath12 @xcite . furthermore , if the full flavor symmetry @xmath13 is gauged in the bulk and if ( fully ) _ hierarchical _ yukawa couplings generated from the flavor breaking at the uv brane are shined to the ir brane , minimal - flavor - violation is generically obtained and fermion localization is released from the duty of generating the hierarchy @xcite .",

    "this kind of universality may be achieved by a bulk flavor symmetry @xcite motivated by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",

    "the implications of the mixing of kk and zero mode fermions as a source of fcnc is typically smaller @xcite , but one may suspect that pushing light generations closer to the ir brane as in our case may enlarge dangerous mixing effects from higgs .",
    "however , yukawa couplings become smaller correspondingly , and therefore mixing is reduced .",
    "for example , mixing between kk mode @xmath66 and zero mode @xmath67 fermions can be written as ( by matching 5d yukawa interaction with 4d effective actions of 4d decompositions @xmath68 ) _",
    "yukawa d^4x y h(x ) ( f_l^n _ l^n(x ) ) ( f_r^0 _ r^0(x ) ) = d^4x m_f _ l^n(x ) _",

    "the choice of @xmath9 suppresses such well - measured down - type fcnc by additional factors beyond the usual rs case .",
    "we comment that smaller 5d yukawa may increase kk - gluon fcnc in anarchic yukawa approach . if 5d yukawas are anarchic , @xmath74 s determine masses , couplings as well as mixing angles , thus giving relations between them .",

    "however , with hierarchic yukawa , the above relations do not hold and the size of 5d yukawa coupling is , in general , independent of fcnc gauge couplings .",
    "rs contributions to various dipole operators are relatively suppressed for @xmath9 .",
    "dipole operators of the form @xmath81 can induce flavor _ diagonal _",

    "the neutron edm is typically estimated to be an order of magnitude larger @xcite , and the other two give one of the strongest bounds on @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "since dipole operators are chirality flipping , dominant contributors are one - loop diagrams in which higgs and kk fermions are running .",
    "these involve at least two ( higgs ) mixing insertions of kk - zero mode fermions which give a relative suppression factor of about @xmath84 as similarly discussed above .",
    "smaller yukawa couplings and consequent smaller kk - zero fermion mixing suppress higgs - mediated fcnc .",
    "in addition , universal @xmath48 can be capable of additional suppression . if yukawa couplings between wrong - chirality kk fermions vanish ( e.g. , between lh sm singlet and rh sm doublet ) , higgs fcnc is safely chiral suppressed by @xmath85 because the ir - higgs boson couples only to 4d chiral modes satisfying the neumann bc on the ir brane @xcite .",
    "however , higgs fcnc is generically comparable to kk - gluon induced fcnc with the wrong yukawa couplings , since wrong yukawa are generally allowed @xcite .",
    "when such wrong yukawas are identical to corresponding sm yukawas ( which is the case for the bulk higgs by 5d covariance ) , universal @xmath48 eventually has minimal - flavor - violation at low - energy as hierarchical ( sm ) yukawa couplings are assumed to be the only flavor spurion ( up to non - universal @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "then the leading flavor spurion contribution to higgs fcnc is aligned with the mass matrices as f_q y_u , d y_u , d^y_u , d f_u , d ~ ( y_t , b^2 ) f_q y_u , d^ f_u , d m_u , d because hierarchical @xmath88 @xcite . thus , we are safer with higgs fcnc as well .",
    "we also comment that the degeneracy in @xmath48 can get rid of radion - mediated fcnc @xcite .",
    "another concern of pushing light fermions closer to the ir brane is that higher - dimensional operators composed of light fermions are not suppressed enough purely by fermion localization .",
    "the constraint on @xmath3 requires that relevant dimension - six four - fermion operators need to be suppressed by @xmath89 while @xmath90 is required if cp - phase is absent @xcite .",
