    "last decade has witnessed an ever - growing interest of the scientific and engineering communities in atomically thin two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials @xcite .",
    "this is due to both the unique properties of such materials from the basic science perspective @xcite , as well as their tremendous technological potential @xcite .",
    "while graphene - a flagship of this class of materials - has attracted most of the attention to date , it lacks an electronic bandgap and is thus unsuitable `` as is '' for multiple applications including photovoltaics and electronics @xcite .",
    "the realization of this fact has led to significant efforts spent during the last few years on searching for `` graphene with a bandgap '' , i.e. , atomically thin _ semiconductor _ materials .",
    "of many materials identified as potential semiconductor alternatives to graphene , one of the most promising classes of materials is monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides ( ml - tmdc ) @xcite .",
    "other possible candidates include phosphorene @xcite , stanene @xcite and ultrathin organic - inorganic perovskite crystals @xcite .",
    "a prominent feature of 2d semiconductors ( 2ds ) is the strong coulomb interaction between charge carriers , as compared to their parent 3d materials ( e.g. , bulk tmdc ) .",
    "this effect arises from the so called _ dielectric confinement _ - the dielectric screening of the coulomb interaction between two point charges within a 2d material becomes weak at distances larger than some effective thickness of the material @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the strength of dielectric screening becomes distance - dependent , i.e. , spatially _ non - local_. for example , this effect is pronounced in ml - tmdc , leading to the formation of tightly - bound excitons with binding energies up to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is very different from conventional 3d semiconductors , where the optical response at room temperature is dominated by independent charge carriers @xcite .",
    "such large exciton binding energies in 2ds suggest the possibility of existence of other stable bound states consisting of a larger number of charge carriers ( e.g. , trions , biexcitons ) at near - room temperatures @xcite .",
    "indeed , trions - bound states of a single exciton and an extra charge carrier - with binding energies on the order of @xmath1 in ml - tmdc and up to @xmath2 in few - layer phosphorene have been recently observed @xcite .",
    "very recent evidence of stable bound states of two electrons and two holes - biexcitons - with binding energies of @xmath3 in ml - tmdc has been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the term  excitonic effects \" has been traditionally applied to features of the optical properties of semiconductors , which go beyond the simple picture of non - interacting charge carriers .",
    "in particular , the coulomb interaction between carriers leads to the formation of multi - carrier bound states out of free charge carriers .",
    "theoretically , excitonic effects have mostly been studied at the level of a single exciton using electronic structure theory tools @xcite .",
    "experimentally observed large exciton binding energies were largely reproduced and the detailed structure of excitonic states was studied .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that even without any external dielectric screening ( e.g. , due to a solvent or substrate ) the size of an exciton in ml - tmdc is much larger than the size of a single unit cell @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "quasimomenta of interacting electrons and holes are distributed very close to the positions of the respective band edge extrema in the brillouin zone , see for example the inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this observation justifies the use of the effective mass approximation in the analysis of excitonic effects in ml - tmdc @xcite .    despite enormous interest ,",
    "however , theoretical and computational studies of multi - carrier bound states beyond a single exciton ( e.g. , trions , biexcitons ) in 2ds are rather sparse to date . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the first theoretical analysis of single excitons and trions in novel 2ds explicitly taking into account the spatially _ non - local _ character of dielectric screening was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , followed by refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , trion binding energies were found by means of a simple few - parameter variational wave function @xcite .",
    "trion excitations in these systems have also been studied by means of the fractional dimensional space approach @xcite , and the time - dependent density - matrix functional theory @xcite , but no non - local screening effects were explicitly taken into account in these works .",
    "finally , an accurate analysis of single exciton and trion binding energies in the limit of a very strong non - local 2d screening has been reported very recently @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work is to accurately study the excitonic effects in 2ds at the _ arbitrary _ strength of the non - local 2d screening . within the effective mass approximation",
    ", we demonstrate how a general problem of finding the energy of a bound state of a specific number of charge carriers can be reduced to finding an unknown function of two parameters : the electron - to - hole mass ratio and the screening length .",
    "we then evaluate this function numerically using the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) methodology @xcite .",
    "this specific flavor of the broad class of quantum monte carlo methods is among the most general methods to study interacting quantum many - body systems",
    ". it does not require the assumption of positivity of a wave function ( diffusion quantum monte carlo ) @xcite , or choosing a wave function ansatz ( variational quantum monte carlo ) @xcite , and has been successfully applied to analyze the electronic structure of low - dimensional semiconductors @xcite . in particular , binding energies of excitons , trions and biexcitons in gaas / algaas quantum wells have been accurately evaluated @xcite .",
    "using pimc , we evaluate the exciton , trion and biexciton binding energies for a range of values of the screening length assuming identical isotropic electron and hole effective masses .",
    "this constitutes the main result of the paper , since a straightforward interpolation and rescaling of the obtained numerical results ( compiled in table  [ tab : energies ] ) can be used to evaluate binding energies of single excitons , trions and biexcitons in _ arbitrary _ 2ds with not too different isotropic effective masses ( e.g. , ml - tmdc or stanene ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this work is the first to numerically exactly treat trions and biexcitons in 2ds , albeit within the effective mass approximation .",
    "numerical results , obtained here , can be directly used to analyze experimental data and benchmark other theoretical and computational approaches to excitonic effects in 2ds .",

    "within the effective mass approximation , the hamiltonian for an arbitrary number of interacting charge carriers ( electrons and holes ) inside a 2d semiconductor ( 2ds ) material can be written as @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 are the isotropic effective masses .",
    "we assume only two types of charge carriers with effective masses @xmath7 ( electrons ) and @xmath8 ( holes ) and respective charges @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "number of carriers of each type is encoded by @xmath12 . in this work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 , which corresponds to a single exciton ( @xmath17 ) , positive trion ( @xmath18 ) , negative trion ( @xmath19 ) , or biexciton ( @xmath20 ) , respectively .",
    "accordingly , @xmath21 encodes a summation only over carriers specified by @xmath12 .    in this work ,",
    "the energies of single carriers are defined relative to corresponding band edges , so that the 2ds bandgap does not explicitly enter eq .",
    "( [ eq : genh ] ) .",
    "consequently , the obtained energies of multi - carrier bound states are _ negative _ , and , for example , the energy of a single exciton obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : genh ] ) is not the energy of an exciton peak directly observed in a photoluminescence experiment .",
    "instead , such a negative energy corresponds to an energy release upon the formation of a multi - carrier bound state out of free charge carriers .    the non - locally screened coulomb potential in eq .

    "the effective dielectric constant of the environment is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the dielectric constants of two materials that the 2ds is surrounded by .",
    "screening length is denoted by @xmath28 . in the case of a thin semiconductor layer of a finite thickness @xmath29 and an isotropic dielectric constant @xmath30 ,",
    "the screening length is evaluated as @xmath31 @xcite . in the case of a truly two - dimensional material ( e.g. , atomically thin ) ,",
    "the screening length is given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the 2d polarizability of the material .",
    "asymptotic expansions of @xmath34 at large and small @xmath35 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , where @xmath38 is euler s constant @xcite .",

    "most of the electric field lines are confined within the 2ds . in this case",
    ", the coulomb potential becomes logarithmic .",
    "the dimensional analysis of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : genh ] ) with only a single type of carrier for each charge sign results in the following universal expression for the ground state energy @xmath40 where @xmath41 is some yet unknown dimensionless function of two continuous real arguments , that does also depend on the number of electrons and holes in a system via the parameter @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the arguments are @xmath42 - ratio of electron and hole effective masses , and @xmath43 - screening length normalized by the bohr radius .",
    "the bohr radius is introduced as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the reduced mass .",
    "the bohr energy is @xmath46 .",
    "general properties and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath47 as a function of mass ratio @xmath48 and the dimensionless 2d screening length @xmath49 can be understood without performing numerical calculations .",
    "first of all , it is important to note that since the hamiltonian ( [ eq : genh ] ) does possess the charge conjugation symmetry ( @xmath50-symmetry ) , it is sufficient to specify @xmath47 only in the range of @xmath51 . indeed ,",
    "due to the @xmath50-symmetry one always has @xmath52 where @xmath53 specifies a multi - carrier state obtained from state @xmath12 by charge conjugation .",
    "for example , if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , knowing the energy of @xmath14 at @xmath56 immediately gives the energy of @xmath15 at @xmath57 and vice versa .",
    "substitution @xmath58 naturally arises from the charge conjugation of @xmath42 .",
    "two important consequences of eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - symm ] ) are as follows .",
    "the first rather trivial one is that energies of positive and negative trions are the same at @xmath59 . henceforth , we will use designation @xmath60 for trions when electron and hole masses are identical and therefore the overall charge of a trion is irrelevant for energetics .",
    "the second consequence is that @xmath61 which can be directly obtained by differentiation of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - symm ] ) . for trions",
    ", this equation means that if , for example , the energy of the positive trion decreases with @xmath48 at fixed @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then the energy of the negative trion necessarily _ increases _ with the same magnitude of the derivative . for charge - neutral multi - carrier states ,",
    "i.e. , excitons and biexcitons in this work , we have @xmath64 , and , therefore @xmath65 since the energy of a single exciton does not depend on the electron or hole effective mass independently , but only through the reduced mass @xmath62 , @xmath66 does not actually depend on @xmath48 , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : der_neutral ] ) is redundant for @xmath13 .",
    "however , @xmath47 does in general depend on the mass ratio for bound states of more than two carriers . consequently , eq .  ( [ eq : der_neutral ] ) suggests a somewhat non - trivial result for biexcitons - weak dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath48 when electron and hole effective masses are similar .    in the opposite limit ,",
    "i.e. , when the mass ratio @xmath48 becomes very small , one has @xmath68 and @xmath69 . under these conditions ,",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation can be applied by treating holes as classical particles .",
    "then , the first quantum - mechanical correction to the relative motion of holes would be to treat that motion as vibrational normal modes of an `` electron - hole molecule '' with frequencies @xmath70 .",
    "the zero - point energy of such vibrational normal modes leads to a non - analytic asymptotic behavior of @xmath47 at @xmath71 @xmath72 these considerations , however , require the presence of more than a single hole .",

    "the result is shown by the horizontal dashed red line and is seen to be within the error bar of the pimc result .",
    "it turns out that two modifications to hamiltonian ( [ eq : genh ] ) are necessary to make it suitable for pimc calculations .",
    "the first modification concerns the fact that pimc calculations are always performed at finite temperature ( @xmath130 ) , and at _ any _ finite temperature the entropic contribution to the partition function favors the complete dissociation of coulomb - bound states . to prevent that we have included a weak attractive harmonic potential to each pair of charge carriers . via the series of numerical tests we have demonstrated that at sufficiently low temperature it is always possible to tune the strength of this harmonic potential so that it is weak enough not to disturb the ground state properties of multi - carrier bound states , and strong enough to prevent dissociation .",
    "the second modification of hamiltonian ( [ eq : genh ] ) concerns the singularity of the coulomb interaction at vanishing inter - particle distances . why this is a problem for pimc calculations and how to solve it in the case of unscreened coulomb interaction by introducing a _",

    "second , one can notice that for potentials that are monotonic functions of inter - particle distances , e.g. , eq .  ( [ eq : h0v0 ] ) , the introduced non - linear rescaling results in a non - vanishing perturbation of the total energy of the system already in the first order with respect to the difference between potential energy functions with and without rescaling .",
    "this first - order deviation can be largely compensated by adding a well - behaved short - range potential to the regularized coulomb potential , so that the integral over the entire 2d plane of the difference between this resulting potential and the original potential vanishes . specifically , we substitute @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0v0 ] ) with @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rescale ] ) and the prefactor @xmath115 is found by requiring that @xmath135 $ ] approaches @xmath136 as @xmath137 . since both @xmath138 and @xmath139 decay exponentially fast at large distances , this integral approaches zero very quickly with @xmath140 .",
    "this guarantees that the low - momentum spatial fourier harmonics of @xmath34 and @xmath141 are almost the same , so that @xmath141 is a non - singular version of @xmath34 that is expected to reproduce the low - energy coulomb scattering correctly .",

    "the accurate treatment of the fermion statistics is required to correctly reproduce eigenstates of hamiltonian ( [ eq : genh ] ) when more than a single charge carrier of the same type ( charge ) is present .",
    "however , applications of quantum monte carlo methods to fermionic systems are plagued by the so called `` fermion sign problem '' @xcite .",
    "the easiest way to avoid this problem is to treat charge carriers as _",
    "distinguishable _ particles and not fermions . this could be done if carriers of the same type do possess `` flavors '' , i.e. , quantum numbers that are conserved by all the interactions in the system .",
    "then , if two carriers have different values of at least one of such quantum numbers , they become effectively distinguishable . for example , if the only present flavor is the spin , then two holes ( or two electrons ) with opposite spin projections can be treated as distinguishable particles within a positively ( or negatively ) charged trion @xcite . in the case of ml - tmdc or stanene , the two two - valued flavors are the spin and the _ pseudospin _ , where the latter labels the two degenerate @xmath143 and @xmath144 valleys in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "these two flavors are independently conserved only approximately since strong excitonic effects and valley - dependent spin - orbit coupling could in principle lead to mixing between the spin and pseudospin projections .",

    "even more , same - charge carriers can become distinguishable in lead chalcogenide semiconductors where there are four degenerate valleys , and , therefore , the total flavor multiplicity ( i.e. , including spin ) is eight @xcite .",
    "pauli repulsion suggests that the lowest - energy configuration of a multi - carrier bound state would consist of effectively distinguishable particles ( i.e. , with different spin or pseudo - spin projections ) , if the number of same - type particles is less than the overall flavor multiplicity , which is four in ml - tmdc and stanene , and eight in lead chalcogenides .",

    "<S> one of the most striking features of novel 2d semiconductors ( e.g. , transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers or phosphorene ) is a strong coulomb interaction between charge carriers resulting in large excitonic effects . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , this leads to the formation of multi - carrier bound states upon photoexcitation ( e.g. , excitons , trions and biexcitons ) , which could remain stable at near - room temperatures and contribute significantly to optical properties of such materials . in the present work we have used the path integral monte carlo methodology to numerically study properties of multi - carrier bound states in 2d semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we have accurately investigated and tabulated the dependence of single exciton , trion and biexciton binding energies on the strength of dielectric screening , including the limiting cases of very strong and very weak screening . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this work are potentially useful in the analysis of experimental data and benchmarking of theoretical and computational models . </S>"
