    "magnetic reconnection in two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) is one of the most intriguing problems in plasma physics , originally motivated by the observation of sudden and rapid release of energy occurring for instance in solar flares and tokamak disruptions .",
    "these phenomena are characterized by a change in the topology of the magnetic field lines and the formation of island - like structures .",
    "resistive instabilities are often addressed as responsible of magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "their development is a consequence of a resistive boundary layer formed nearby a magnetic field neutral line , where the ideal constraint of frozen magnetic flux is relaxed .",
    "their growth rates typically depend on fractional powers of the dissipative coefficients ( through the dimensionless inverse lundquist number and reynolds number ) .",
    "when nonlinear effects are taken into account , the growth of resistive instabilities slows down , eventually reaching saturation @xcite .",
    "numerical studies @xcite have shown that the nonlinear phase of evolution is characterized by the generation of large scale magnetic structures , by means of a coalescence process of small magnetic flux patches .    in this paper",
    "we present a new kind of instability which sets in when the influence of dissipative terms can not be restricted to a limited domain and the boundary layer approximation does not hold anymore .",
    "this instability can be viewed as the mhd counterpart of the large scale hydrodynamical instability which is known to develop in highly anisotropic flows @xcite .",
    "large scale instabilities are formally associated to the existence of negative values of the eddy - viscosity and/or eddy - resistivity .",
    "the exact values of the turbulent dissipative coefficients can be explicitly derived from the knowledge of the equations of motion and of the basic equilibrium state , by means of multiple scale analysis . in the case of a sheared magnetic field embedded in a motionless fluid",
    ", a negative eddy - resistivity instability can develop for high enough lundquist / reynolds numbers , causing the formation of a chain of magnetic islands . as observed for resistive instabilities ,",
    "also in this case , during the nonlinear evolution , the number of magnetic islands decreases , due to the merging of pairs of close islands .",
    "this coalescence process eventually leads to the formation of a single island , whose width is determined by the largest scale allowed in the system .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we briefly introduce the fluid equations of magnetohydrodynamics and their basic equilibrium states . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the behavior of large scale perturbations is investigated making use of multiple - scale analysis and exact expressions for eddy - viscosity and eddy - resistivity are derived .",
    "the main result is the appearance of large scale transverse instabilities , associated to negative values of the renormalized dissipative coefficients . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we focus on the case of marginal instability for which we obtain the effective equation for the large scale behavior and we show that the full nonlinear regime is characterized by the evolution towards a fixed point . in section [ sec5 ] , we present the results of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) , which display a clear _ quantitative _ agreement with the predictions of multiple - scale analysis , both in the linear and in the nonlinear phase .",

    "we consider @xmath20 , in order to investigate the stability of a sheared magnetic field in a motionless conducting fluid , in a slab geometry with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "such a configuration is widely used to study the evolution of reconnecting modes .",
    "it is known @xcite that the slab geometry can be trusted as realistic and resistive instabilities can develop only if the slab aspect ratio ( @xmath21 ) is less than one .",
    "for this reason it is of great interest the question related to the stability of the above configuration with respect to transverse perturbations on scales larger than the typical scale of the basic magnetic flux .",
    "these large scale instabilities are eventually responsible for the onset of the inverse cascade of the square magnetic potential @xmath22 in fully developed 2d mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "as a first step , using a standard multiple - scale technique , we derive analytically the large - scale magnetic flux @xmath23 and stream function @xmath24 equations .",

    "it is worth noticing that in general the large - scale mhd dynamics is first order in time and space ( the well - known @xmath35 effect ) @xcite , but it can be shown that this is not the case for parity - invariant basic configurations @xcite .    by substituting ( [ eq : der ] ) and",

    "the dependence on the fast time variables can be discarded by observing that it reduces to a transient not affecting the long - time behavior , thanks to the fact that the forcing and the basic flux are time - independent ( a rigorous proof needs the construction of a poincar inequality ) .",

    "in this situation we have shown analytically , by means of multiple - scale analysis , that large scale instabilities can arise above a definite threshold , and that for a generic perturbation the maximum growth is achieved by modes transverse to the magnetic field lines of the basic state .",
    "on the basis of this result , we have performed the multiple scale analysis for the marginally unstable case and for purely transverse perturbations .",
    "the analytic procedure yields a couple of partial differential equations which describe the full nonlinear evolution of magnetic perturbations .",
    "it is possible to show that these equations possess a lyapunov functional and thus their solutions asymptotically approach a fixed point which represents a nonlinear equilibrium different from the basic one .",
    "the kinetic perturbations are always linearly stable , and their growth is uniquely due to the nonlinear coupling to the magnetic field .",
    "numerical simulations of two - dimensional mhd performed with a pseudospectral code reveal an excellent _ quantitative agreement _ with the first - order analytical prediction in a wide range of values of the perturbative parameter .",
    "we therefore conclude that the loss of stability of parallel magnetic field configurations at moderate reynolds number is due to the growth of large scale perturbations , and that the features of this instability can be captured by a multiple scale analysis .",
    "the transverse large - scale instability is likely to be the generic mechanism of instability of sheared magnetic fields even for large lundquist / reynolds numbers whenever the basic state admits a large number of neutral lines . when there is a single neutral line at large enough lundquist / reynolds numbers this mechanism is overcome by the formation of resistive boundary layers .",
