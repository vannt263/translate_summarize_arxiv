    "graphene  @xcite supports charge carriers that behave as dirac fermions , which , in a magnetic field , lead to a particle - hole symmetric and unequally - spaced pattern of landau levels .",
    "accordingly , graphene gives rise to a variety of cyclotron resonance , both intraband and interband , with resonance energies varying from one resonance to another .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to standard quantum hall systems with a parabolic energy dispersion , where cyclotron resonance takes place between adjacent landau levels , hence at a single frequency @xmath1 , which , according to kohn s theorem ,  @xcite is unaffected by electron - electron interactions .",
    "the nonparabolic spectra  @xcite in graphene offer the challenge of detecting many - body corrections to cyclotron resonance .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite over the past few years have revealed some notable features of quantum corrections to cyclotron resonance in graphene and bilayer  @xcite graphene .",
    "the genuine many - body corrections arise from vacuum polarization , specific to graphene , which diverges logarithmically at short wavelengths .",
    "this means that one has to carry out renormalization properly , as in quantum electrodynamics , to extract observable results .",
    "in particular , for bilayer graphene it turns out that both the leading intralayer and interlayer coupling strengths undergo renormalization and that their renormalized strengths run with the magnetic field .",
    "bilayer graphene is marked with the unique property that its band gap is externally controllable .",
    "@xcite    experiment has so far verified , via infrared spectroscopy , some basic features of cyclotron resonance in monolayer  @xcite and bilayer  @xcite graphene .",
    "the data for the monolayer show a good symmetry between the electron and hole bands but generally show no clear sign of the many - body effect , except for a datum .",
    "@xcite indeed , a comparison between some leading intraband and interband cyclotron resonances revealed a small deviation in excitation energy , consistent with the presence of many - body corrections roughly in magnitude and sign .",
    "the situation is quite different for bilayer graphene , for which only a limited number of data are available so far .",
    "the data  @xcite on intraband resonances show a weak electron - hole asymmetry , and generally defy a good fit by theory .",
    "actually one has to employ different values of the velocity factor @xmath2 to fit the electron data and hole data separately .",
    "earlier raman  @xcite spectroscopy and subsequent infrared  @xcite spectroscopy of bilayer graphene under zero magnetic field also revealed a significant asymmetry between the conduction and valence bands , mainly due to subleading intra- and inter - layer couplings @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reexamine cyclotron resonance in bilayer graphene , with possible electron - hole and valley asymmetries taken into account .",
    "it is not clear _ a priori _ whether the renormalizability of the low - energy effective theory is maintained in the presence of electron - hole asymmetry , since the asymmetry parameters ( especially , @xmath4 ) critically modify the ultraviolet structure of the theory .",
    "we show that the theory indeed remains renormalizable to @xmath5 ( at least ) , and that the renormalization counterterms depend on @xmath4 in a nontrivial way .",
    "we present a general algorithm to carry out renormalization for graphene under a magnetic field , executable even numerically .",
    "inclusion of electron - hole asymmetry parameters partially improves the theoretical fit to the existing data , and the fit in turn suggests some nontrivial modification of the spectra of the zero - mode and pseudo - zero - mode landau levels specific to bilayer graphene .    in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the effective theory of bilayer graphene and examine the effect of electron - hole and valley asymmetries . in sec .",
    "iii we study the coulombic many - body corrections to cyclotron resonance , with a focus on renormalization and its consequences .",
    "section  iv is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "bilayer graphene consists of two coupled honeycomb lattices of carbon atoms , arranged in bernal @xmath6 stacking .",
    "the electrons in it are described by four - component spinor fields on the four inequivalent sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the bottom and top layers , and their low - energy features are governed by the two inequivalent fermi points @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the brillouin zone .",
    "the intralayer coupling @xmath11 ev is related to the fermi velocity @xmath12  m / s ( with @xmath13 nm ) in monolayer graphene .",
    "the interlayer couplings  @xcite @xmath14ev and @xmath15ev are one - order of magnitude weaker than @xmath16 .",
    "actually , interlayer hopping via the @xmath17 dimer bonds modifies the intralayer linear spectra to yield quasi - parabolic spectra  @xcite in the low - energy branches @xmath18 .    the bilayer hamiltonian with the leading intra- and inter - layer couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 lead to electron - hole symmetric spectra .",
    "infrared spectroscopy  @xcite of bilayer graphene , however , has detected some weak asymmetry between the electron and hole bands , such as ( i ) the energy difference @xmath21 mev between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 sublattices within the same layer and ( ii ) the next - nearest - neighbor interlayer coupling @xmath24 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian with such intra- and inter - layer couplings is written as  @xcite @xmath25 , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal h}_{+ } & = & \\left ( \\begin{array}{cccc } { 1\\over{2}}u &   & v_{4}\\ , p^{\\dag }   & v\\,p^{\\dag } \\\\    & -{1\\over{2}}u & v\\,p & v_{4}\\ , p \\\\",

    "we ignore the effect of trigonal warping @xmath30 which , in a strong magnetic field , causes only a negligibly small level shift .",
    "@xcite we also ignore weak zeeman coupling and , for conciseness , suppress the electron spin .",
    "our definition of @xmath31 differs in sign and by factor @xmath2 from the one ( @xmath32 ) in the literature  @xcite ; this choice is made simply for notational convenience .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath33 at another ( @xmath10 ) valley is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and acts on a spinor of the form @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath34 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath33 with the sign of @xmath29 reversed , @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the electronic spectrum at the @xmath10 valley is obtained from the spectrum at the @xmath9 valley by reversing the sign of @xmath29 ; in particular , the spectra at the two valleys are the same for @xmath39 .",
    "nonzero interlayer voltage @xmath40 thus acts as a valley - symmetry breaking .",
    "we adopt the set of experimental values  @xcite @xmath41 in what follows .",
    "full account is also taken of the effect of interlayer bias @xmath29 . for notational simplicity , however , we often present analytical expressions only for @xmath39 .",

    "these band spectra acquire nonzero valley gaps for @xmath40 .",
    "let us place bilayer graphene in a strong uniform magnetic field @xmath48 normal to the sample plane ; we set , in @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 , and denote the the magnetic length as @xmath53 .",
    "it is easily seen that the eigenmodes of @xmath34 have the structure @xmath54 , where only the orbital eigenmodes are shown using the standard harmonic - oscillator basis @xmath55 ( with the understanding that @xmath56 for @xmath57 ) .",

    "this eigenvalue @xmath84 changes sign if one sets @xmath85 and @xmath86 simultaneously .",
    "thus the assignment of @xmath87 in general depends on the choice of asymmetry parameters @xmath88 and also on the interlayer bias @xmath29 .",

    "interestingly , for @xmath93 , @xmath94 at one valley while @xmath95 at another valley crosses  @xcite @xmath96 from below with increasing magnetic field @xmath23 .",

    "the denominator @xmath361 is cast in the form @xmath362 which , for @xmath363 , leads to the band spectra @xmath364 in eq .",

    "is written as the convolution @xmath215 of @xmath365 and the instantaneous limit of the electron propagator @xmath366 .",
    "in particular , divergences arise from the portion of @xmath218 , that decreases like @xmath367 or slower for @xmath368 , and we shall focus on that portion .",
    "integration over @xmath369 , with the standard boundary condition , is readily carried out , yielding , e.g. , @xmath370 where @xmath371 @xmath372 is short for @xmath373 in eq .",
    "( [ denom ] ) . when the integrand is @xmath374 ,",
    "replace the numerator on the the right - hand side with @xmath375 ; for @xmath376 replace it with @xmath377 .",
    "actually , this structure combined with the band spectra  ( [ eip ] ) gives rise to a simple rule to handle the integration over @xmath369 : one can effectively replace @xmath378 in @xmath379 in evaluating their large-@xmath380 behavior .",
    "one may further note the following : ( i )  the denominator @xmath381 for large @xmath380 .",

    "the portion @xmath403 in @xmath404 has the asymptotic form @xmath405 which leads to no divergence and this means that @xmath46 remains finite .",

    "those common @xmath412 terms , though leading to a divergent correction , simply shift the zero of energy and are of no physical relevance .",
