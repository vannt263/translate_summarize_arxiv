    "an important goal of astrophysics is to understand the non - thermal phenomena in the universe . in our galaxy ,",
    "pulsars and x - ray binaries are well - known objects that generate high - energy electrons and possibly protons , which emit non - thermal photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , sensitive searches of non - thermal x - rays have led to magnetic white dwarfs also being considered as possible non - thermal emitters @xcite . in addition to rotating magnetospheres , like pulsars , shocks in supernova remnants ( snrs ) and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) are the most common galactic cosmic - ray acceleration sites ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "searching for new types of particle - acceleration sites is a possible key to understanding the non - thermal universe .    in this paper , we focus on early - type massive stars with velocities greater than @xmath10 km s@xmath0 , that is , runaway ob stars , as another source of non - thermal emission .",
    "the most prominent characteristics of runaway ob stars are their high spatial velocities and their very fast stellar winds .",
    "the velocities of the stellar winds reach a few thousand kilometers per second , which is comparable with the shock speeds of young snrs ( @xcite and references therein ) . thus , in the rest frame of an ob star , two shocks ( a bow shock and a wind termination shock ) and a contact discontinuity appear in order to balance the ram pressure of the interstellar gas with that of the stellar wind @xcite .",
    "bow shock structures can often be seen in infrared images of runaway ob stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite have reported radio observations in the nrao - vla sky survey program , indicating the presence of high - energy electrons in the bow shock region of runaway star bd+43@xmath13654 .",
    "the object bd+43@xmath13654 is thought to be a blue straggler system formed by a close encounter between two tight massive binaries @xcite in the core of the cygnus ob2 association ( @xcite and references therein ) , which is the most massive ob association in the solar neighborhood , at a distance of @xmath11 kpc @xcite .",
    "the spectral type of the star is o4if with an age of about 1.6 myr and a stellar mass of @xmath12 @xcite ; the star is one of the most massive runaway stars known today .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity is measured to be @xmath13 km s@xmath0 @xcite . the typical mass - loss rate for o4i stars with a stellar wind velocity of @xmath14 2300 km  s@xmath0 is @xmath15 yr@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the bow shock structure was found by iras observations in a systematic 60 @xmath16 m survey @xcite , and was confirmed by the midcourse space experiment in the d and e bands @xcite .",
    "synchrotron emission was also found from this region in the radio bands at 1.42 ghz and 4.86 ghz , as already mentioned @xcite .",
    "we can investigate the runaway system as a shock acceleration site by using its similarities with snrs : velocity of stellar wind , system size , environment of inter - stellar matter , etc . if we adopt the typical parameters of stellar winds from o4i stars @xcite , the stellar wind has a kinetic luminosity up to @xmath17 the termination shock causes particle acceleration which generates high - energy protons and electrons @xcite . in order to account for the radio luminosity of bd+43@xmath13654 reported by @xcite , high energy electrons with the energy index of @xmath18 should have a total energy of @xmath19 ergs , under the assumption of equipartition between the energy densities of electrons @xmath20 and magnetic field @xmath21 , as is the case with many young snrs @xcite . in this case , corresponding magnetic - field strength @xmath22 is about a few tens of micro gauss .",
    "then , the cooling timescale of electrons emitting synchrotron radiation with characteristic frequency @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 is much longer than the dynamical timescale , @xmath25 where @xmath26 pc is the distance to the shock front of the bow shock measured by @xcite .",
    "electrons are accelerated and emitting synchrotron radiation around the shock region .",
    "they escape from the shock region flowing out along the stream backward of the star in a certain time scale .",
    "assuming that the system is in a steady state , the electron production rate @xmath27 is roughly identical to the loss rate from the system .",
    "in that case , @xmath27 will be described by @xmath28 divided by the escaping time scale . here , we regard the dynamical effects should be dominant , since the cooling time scale of the electrons is fairly longer than the dynamical time scale , @xmath29 , as described above ( equations ( [ eq : timescale_sync ] ) and ( [ eq : timescale_dy ] ) ) .",
    "thus a rough estimate of @xmath27 is @xmath30 erg s@xmath0 , which corresponds to about 0.3% of @xmath31 given in equation ( [ eq : momentum_sw ] ) .",
    "therefore , the conversion from the energies of stellar winds into the acceleration power of particles in this runaway star system has an efficiency of the same order of magnitude as those in snrs .    since about 10% of o - stars exhibit bow shock structures @xcite , the @xmath32 runaway stars in our galaxy can produce a non - negligible proportion of about 10% of the cosmic - ray electrons observed at earth ( i.e. , @xmath33 erg s@xmath0 ) , if bd+43@xmath13654 , with its high - energy electron production rate of @xmath34 erg s@xmath0 , represents the typical case of a runaway - star system as a particle acceleration site .",
    "therefore , it is important to study physical parameters of the particle acceleration process in bd+43@xmath13654 .    in the sense of energetics , bd+43@xmath13654 is an snr - equivalent particle acceleration site .",
    "then , the next studies should be how much energy the particles gain in the system .",
    "the maximum energy of accelerated electrons , @xmath35 , is measured by the roll - off frequency , @xmath36 , of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "if @xmath35 is @xmath8 820 tev as suggested by @xcite , then , according to equation ( 2 ) in @xcite , @xmath36 should be @xmath37@xmath38@xmath39 hz , which comes into the x - ray band . if the spectrum were simply extended from the radio band so that @xmath40 , then x - rays should be clearly detected with the sensitivities of current missions . in that case the absence of x - rays would provide a unique upper limit @xmath35 .",
    "however , high sensitivity to diffuse x - ray emissions is required in this case . in this study",
    ", we performed an x - ray search for possible synchrotron emission from the shock region of bd+43@xmath13654 with the x - ray satellite suzaku @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the x - ray observations of this object in section [ section : obs ] , summarize the results of suzaku analyses in section [ section : ana ] , and discuss our results in section [ section : discussion ] .",
    "_ suzaku _ is the fifth in a series of japanese x - ray satellites having sensitivities in the 0.2600 kev band @xcite .",
    "it carries two x - ray instruments on board : the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) for the 0.212 kev band @xcite , and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) for the 12600 kev band @xcite .",
    "although both instruments have very low - background signals @xcite , which enable us to perform high sensitivity surveys of x - rays , the suzaku xis is most suitable for our purpose because it is capable of imaging and stable backgrounds .",
    "we observed bd+43@xmath13654 and the bow shock region with suzaku from 2011 april 4 1:53  ut to april 6 2:13  ut ( obsid=506004010 ) . to put the bow shock region at the xis nominal pointing position ,",
    "the aiming point was set to ( @xmath41)[j2000 ] = ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , although the runaway star is at ( @xmath41)[j2000 ] = ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) . the xis was operated in the normal clocking mode , without window / burst options but with the space charge - injection ( sci ) function @xcite .",
    "the xis consists of three front - side illuminated ( fi ) ccd chips ( xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) and one back - side illuminated ( bi ) chip ( xis1 ) .",
    "xis2 was not operational due to damage from a meteoroid strike .",
    "hxd was operated in nominal mode : half of the 64 pin diodes were operated with a voltage of 400 v and the others at 500 v , and the pmts were operated at nominal gain .",
    "we used the observation datasets processed by the standard suzaku pipeline version 2.5.16.29 , with the calibration version ( caldbver ) of hxd20101202 , xis20101108 , xrt20100730 , and xrs20060410 .",
    "ftools _ from the headas 6.11 package with xspec version 12.7.0 .",
    "the source was detected by the xis in the 0.510 kev band at an average count rate of 0.15 and 0.28 cnt s@xmath0 per sensor in the fi- and bi- ccd cameras , respectively .",
    "cleaned events of the xis data were obtained using the standard criteria of the pipeline process .",
    "the total exposure of the xis was 99.0 ks .",
    "we did not use the hxd - gso data because of sensitivity limitations . according to the integral catalog",
    ", there were no contaminating sources in the field of view ( fov ) of the hxd - pin detector .",
    "the cleaned events from hxd - pin were obtained by using the standard criteria of the process .",
    "the total exposure of hxd - pin was 82.5 ks .",
    "the averaged count rate of the cleaned pin data including backgrounds was 0.40 cnt s@xmath0 in the 1370 kev band .",
    "the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) events were estimated and provided by the hxd team .",
    "we used them with method=`lcfitdt(bgd_d ) ' and the methodv=`2.0ver0804 ' .",
    "the average count rate of the nxb was 0.38 cnt s@xmath0 in the same energy range , and the residual count rate is consistent with the level of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb , 0.02 cnt s@xmath0 ) within the systematic errors of nxb @xcite .",
    "therefore , hxd - pin detected no significant signals in the 1370 kev band , and thus we do not use the hxd data in the following analyses .",
    "we first checked the xis images in the 0.510 kev band .",
    "the spatial distributions of the non x - ray backgrounds ( nxbs ) on the xis chips in the 0.510 kev band were estimated by the suzaku _ ftool _ _ xisnxbgen _ @xcite using the background database in the caldb area for the period from 120 days before to 30 days after the observation . after the subtraction of the nxb image from the sky image with the xis in the same energy bandpass , the vignetting effects of the x - ray telescopes ( xrts ) were corrected by a simulated map calculated for a uniform sky input with the ray - tracing tool _ xissim _ @xcite . in this simulation , we assume that the energy spectrum of incident photons follows the power - law shape with a photon index of 1.0",

    "cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      to estimate the possible diffuse - x - ray emissions around the bow shock region numerically , we first defined three regions : ` bd43 ' , ` bsk ' , and ` bgd ' , representing bd+43@xmath13654 , its bow shock , and the background areas , respectively .",
    "the definitions of these areas are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_image_region ] .",
    "the circular areas around the xmm sources are excluded from the bsk and bgd regions ; the radii of these excluded regions were defined by their luminosities .",
    "the geometrical areas of bd43 , bsk , and bgd were 11.5 , 41.2 , and 44.8 arcmin@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "then , we counted x - ray events detected with the xis , taking into account vignetting effects of the xrts , we obtained @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 cnt arcmin@xmath3 , for bd43 , bsk , and bgd , respectively , where the errors are the 99% statistical ones .",
    "thus , the events in the bsk region exceed those in the bgd region by @xmath65 cnt arcmin@xmath3 statistically .",
    "the measurement of the enhanced counts in the bsk region ( @xmath65 cnt arcmin@xmath3 ) has systematic errors in estimations of the nxb and cxb . that of nxb is reported as 5% by @xcite , and we adopt this value in this paper .",
    "the systematic error in the cxb level is caused by fluctuations in numbers of unresolved point sources ( which are mainly active galactic nuclei ) . according to the systematic studies of cxb with asca by @xcite , the cxb flux within the field of view of the gis ( gas imaging spectrometer ; @xcite ; 0.5 deg@xmath7 ) fluctuated by 6.5% in the 2 to 10 kev band .",
    "since the size of the bsk region is about 42 arcmin@xmath7 , the fluctuation would be 43% for the bsk region by the xis . as described in session",
    "[ section : ana_image ] , we removed dimmer point sources from the xis data than the gis observation ; i.e. , the flux limit for the gis was @xmath66 erg s@xmath0 cm@xmath3 @xcite , whereas our analyses achieved @xmath67 erg s@xmath0 cm@xmath3 ( section [ section : ana_image ] ) .",
    "if we adopt the index of the @xmath68 ",
    "@xmath69 relation for the population of point sources in cxb is 1.5 , the cxb flux in our observation should have 12% fluctuation after removal of point sources with xmm - newton .",
    "therefore , the systematic errors of nxb and cxb are 5% and 12% for this fov , respectively .",
    "numerically , the systematic errors for the nxb and cxb in the count rates of bd43 , bsk , and bgd were @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 cnt arcmin@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "thus , the enhancement was @xmath73 cnt arcmin@xmath3 , where the first , second , third errors represent statistics , systematics in the nxb estimation , and systematics in the cxb estimation , respectively ; i.e. , the x - ray count rate in the bsk region is consistent with that in the bgd region within the systematic errors .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the bsk region , in which the vignetting - corrected cxb and the nxb were subtracted , can be well reproduced by a power - law model with a photon index of @xmath74 and an x - ray flux of @xmath75 erg s@xmath0 cm@xmath3 in the 0.510 kev band , where the first and second errors , respectively , correspond to the statistical error and the combined systematic errors for cxb and nxb , at the 3 sigma level .",
    "thus , the 3-sigma upper limit of the x - ray luminosity from the bsk region in the 0.510 kev band is @xmath6 erg s@xmath0 at a distance of 1.4 kpc .",
    "we searched for diffuse x - ray emissions from the shock region of bd+43@xmath13654 with suzaku ( see section [ section : obs ] ) , and found an upper limit for the diffuse x - ray luminosity of @xmath6 erg s@xmath0 per 41.2 arcmin@xmath7 in the 0.510 kev band ( see section [ section : ana_flux_diffuse ] ) . by analogy with snr systems ( see section [ section : introduction : snrcomparison ] ) , if the termination shock occurs in the region , interstellar materials would be shock - heated , and electrons or protons would be shock - accelerated .",
    "we discuss the efficiency of the heating by shock in section [ section : discussion_thermal ] , and the acceleration process in section [ section : discussion_nonthermal ] .",
    "if we assume that the value of @xmath76 for the object is the typical value of 2300 km  s@xmath0 @xcite and that the stellar gas has a typical temperature of @xmath77 k and acts as an ideal gas having a heating ratio of @xmath78 , then the sound speed in the gas is @xmath79 cm s@xmath0 .",
    "this value is much lower than @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we can expect a strong termination shock to occur inside the contact discontinuity facing the runaway star , while the bow shock occurs on the opposite side .",
    "in this situation , the cold materials of the stellar wind could be shock - heated to a temperature of @xmath80 where @xmath16 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are the mean ratio of numbers of electrons and nucleons , the mass of hydrogen , and boltzmann constant , respectively . in other words , we can expect hot plasmas to exist immediately behind the termination shock .    in the rest frame of the star , the interstellar - matter ( ism ) gas flows toward the star and forms shocks through interaction with the stellar wind .",
    "the incoming energy of the ism flow per unit time is @xmath83 , where we have neglected enthalpy , and @xmath84 is the stellar bulk speed through the ism .",
    "this gives a smaller contribution to the energy source of a possible thermal emission than the ejected kinetic luminosity of the stellar wind , @xmath85 , by a factor of @xmath86 , assuming @xmath87 .",
    "here , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the densities of uniform ism and the stellar wind just in front of the termination shock , respectively , and we simply assume the pressure balance , @xmath90 , and a spherical shape for the termination shock with radius @xmath91 .",
    "however , the shocked , hot region is compressed to have a density @xmath92 at most , and thus we can expect an anisotropy of the emission from hot plasmas : it should be brighter toward the runway direction as in the radio synchrotron image @xcite .",
    "the suzaku observation represents the upper limit of the x - ray luminosity at @xmath93 erg s@xmath0 , which corresponds to the emission measure em of @xmath94 @xmath54 for plasmas with the temperature of @xmath95 kev as expected by equation ( [ eq : shock_temperature ] ) .",
    "this value of the upper limit of em reduces only by factor 4 even if we change @xmath57 by one order of magnitude lower .",
    "the em can be described as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the density of thermal electrons , @xmath98 is the volume of the plasma , @xmath99 is the averaged value of electron density , @xmath100 is the volume of the bow shock region ( @xmath101 @xmath102 ; @xcite ) , and @xmath103 is a density - weighted filling factor of the plasma in the bow shock region .",
    "if we adopt the density of cold electrons @xmath104",
    "@xmath54 @xcite , the upper limit of em can be written into the following constraint ; @xmath105 therefore , the shock - heating process is inefficient in the shock region of the runaway star bd+43@xmath13654 . if all the cold materials are heated into the hot plasma ( @xmath106 ) , for example , then a very small fraction of the shock region would be shock - heated ; i.e. , when a top thin region emits thermal x - rays as discussed in @xcite , the thickness of the region would be less than @xmath107 cm . otherwise ,",
    "if the all the shock region emit thermal x - rays ( @xmath108 ) , then only @xmath109 3 % of cold electrons are heated by shocks .",
    "we expect further deep survey by a micro - calorimeter onboard the near future x - ray mission , astro - h .",
    "as indicated by @xcite , high - energy electrons with @xmath18 on average should exist around the shocked region and emit synchrotron radio radiation . from the x - ray observations obtained with suzaku",
    ", we obtained a 3-sigma upper - limit of the x - ray luminosity at @xmath6 erg s@xmath0 in the 0.5 to 10 kev band .",
    "[ fig : discussion_sed ] shows the multi - wavelength spectra from the shocked region of bd+43@xmath13654 .",
    "we have also plotted the energy spectra of synchrotron emissions for @xmath110 2.5 or 2.0 , assuming that the synchrotron emitting region is a sphere with a radius of @xmath111 cm and that the energy densities of electron and magnetic fields are in equipartition ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) .",

    "let us consider the time scales for the constraint of the magnetic - field turbulence , which is in the bohm limit for pwne and snrs ( c.f . , @xcite ) .",
    "the cooling time scale of electrons with the maximum energy via synchrotron emission ( @xmath125  kyr and 4.1  kyr for @xmath126 and 2.0 , respectively , from equation  ( [ eq : timescale_sync ] ) ) is longer than the dynamical timescale of @xmath127  kyr ( see equation  ( [ eq : timescale_dy ] ) ) .",
    "thus @xmath35 is determined from the balance of the acceleration and the dynamical timescales , and we obtain @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the ratio of the mean free path and the gyroradius of electrons @xcite . in the bohm limit , @xmath130 becomes 1 .",

    "therefore , the magnetic field might not be as turbulent as in pwne and snrs .",
    "non thermal emission from protons , as well as electrons , could contribute possible gamma - ray emission in fermi and cta band @xcite .",
    "the low level of turbulence from our results in the x - ray band with the assumption of equipartition between @xmath135 and @xmath136 indicates low acceleration efficiency , not only for electrons but also for protons . in this situation",
    ", the maximum energy of protons must be far below the knee energy of @xmath137  ev .",
    "furthermore , if the magnetic - field turbulence is generated by accelerated protons themselves , as in the case of snrs @xcite , the fact that @xmath138 suggests a lower density of cosmic - ray protons in this system , which implies the proton injection rate is smaller than that in snrs .",

    "<S> accelerated particles from measurements of possible non - thermal emissions in the x - ray band , suzaku observed bd+43@xmath13654 in april 2011 with an exposure of 99 ks . because the onboard instruments have a stable and low background level , suzaku detected a possible enhancement over the background of @xmath2 cnt arcmin@xmath3 at the bow shock region , where the error represents the 3 sigma statistics only . </S>",
    "<S> however , the excess is not significant within the systematic errors of non - x - ray and cosmic - ray backgrounds of the x - ray imaging spectrometer , which are @xmath4 and @xmath5 cnt arcmin@xmath3 , respectively , and the 3-sigma upper limit in the x - ray luminosity from the shock region , which is @xmath6 erg s@xmath0 per 41.2 arcmin@xmath7 in the 0.5 to 10 kev band . </S>",
    "<S> this result leads to three conclusions : ( 1 ) a shock - heating process is inefficient on this system ; ( 2 ) the maximum energy of electrons does not exceed @xmath8 10 tev , corresponding to a lorentz factor of less than @xmath9 ; and ( 3 ) the magnetic field in the shock acceleration site might not be as turbulent as those in pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants . </S>"
