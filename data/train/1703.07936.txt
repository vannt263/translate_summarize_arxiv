    "synchronization behavior of coupled oscillators is not only a fascinating manifestation of self - organization that nature uses to orchestrate essential processes of life , such as the beating of the heart , but also common in man - made systems , including josephson junction , semiconductor laser , etc @xcite .",
    "the first scientific record of synchronization can be traced to the letter from christian huygens to moray in 1665 , where the anti - phase synchronization ( aps ) of two pendulum clocks hung from a common beam supported by two chairs has been described @xcite . in the past decades , with the blooming of nonlinear science and complex systems , synchronization behaviors in coupled oscillators have been extensively studied in a variety of fields , and are regarded as being closely connected to the functionality and operation of many realistic systems @xcite . for two coupled oscillators , the research interest is mainly focusing on the entrainment of the oscillator trajectories , in which a variety of synchronization forms have been revealed , including complete synchronization , in - phase synchronization ( ips ) , aps , generalized synchronization , delay synchronization , etc @xcite . while for an ensemble of coupled oscillators , the research interest has been mainly focusing on the formation of various synchronous patterns , and also the transition among the patterns @xcite .",
    "recently , stimulated by the discovery of the small - world and scale - free features in many natural and man - made complex networks , the synchronization behaviors of complex networks have received considerable attention @xcite .    the experiment of two coupled pendulums studied by huygens has been revisited actively in recent years , for its easy realization in experiment and the rich dynamical phenomena it offers @xcite . in 2002 , bennett _",
    "et al_. repeated the experiment by a redesigned device where two pendulum clocks are hang on a heavy supporter mounted on a low - friction wheeled cart .",
    "it is found that the aps state discovered by huygens occurs only when the natural frequencies of the clocks are of small mismatch @xcite .",
    "pantaleone simplified the experiment by placing two metronomes on a freely moving board supported by two empty cans @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a theoretical model has been developed to describe the motions of the metronomes , which is able to reproduce both the ips and aps states .",
    "_ studied the basin distribution of ips and aps states , and found that the attracting basin of the aps state can be efficiently enlarged by increasing the rolling friction @xcite .",
    "studied experimentally the phase synchronization of two coupled nonidentical metronomes , and found the frequencies of the metronomes can be looked onto an irrational ratio @xcite .",
    "when three pendulums ( metronomes ) are coupled , an intriguing phenomenon is the formation of synchronous patterns . by coupling three identical pendulums , czolczynski _ et al .",

    "the synchronization behaviors of coupled oscillators are crucially dependent on the symmetry of the underlying coupling structure @xcite . for systems of symmetric coupling ,",
    "the synchronous patterns are generally generated by the mechanism of symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "while symmetry breaking explains the patterns arisen in regular medium , it fails to describe the formation of patterns in complex systems , e.g. , the synchronous patterns on complex networks @xcite . for the sake of simplicity , in previous studies of metronome synchronization",
    "the metronomes are normally placed on the same board ( or hung to the same beam for coupled pendulums ) .",
    "in such a coupling scheme , the system possesses a high - order symmetry ( global - coupling structure ) , as the system dynamics is kept unchanged by exchanging the metronomes . considering the significant influence of coupling symmetry on the formation of patterns @xcite , a natural question therefore is whether synchronous patterns can be observed in asymmetrically coupled metronomes . the answer to",
    "this question is of both theoretical and practical significance , as perfect symmetries are impossible in realistic situations . in the present study ,",
    "we move forward a step from the traditional studies of symmetrically coupled metronomes by deteriorating the coupling symmetry , and explore the new synchronization behaviors arisen in asymmetrically coupling metronomes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will introduce the experimental setup , and also the new technique used for detecting the synchronous patterns . in sec .",
    "iii , we will present the experimental results . in sec .",
    "iv , we will construct the theoretical model , and , by numerical simulations , explore the dynamical properties of the synchronous patterns , including their basin distributions and the pattern transitions .",

    "our experimental setup of layered metronomes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . following the design of pantaleone @xcite",
    ", we construct each layer by placing two identical metronomes on a light cardboard , and support the cardboard by two empty soda cans .",
    "the size of the bottom cardboard is larger than the top one , so as to provide sufficient space for a free movement of the top layer .",
    "the whole setup is then placed on the desk .",
    "all four metronomes ( wittner s taktell , series 890 ) are of nearly identical parameters ( parameter mismatch less than 1% ) , with the energy supplied by a hand - wound spring .",
    "the frequency of the metronome can be adjusted by changing the position of the mass on the pendulum bob , ranging from 40 ticks per minute ( largo ) to 208 ticks per minute ( prestissimo ) .",
    "this experimental setup of coupled metronomes is easy to assemble and is able to generate robust synchronous patterns within a few of seconds , making it an excellent experiment for classroom demonstration .",
    "two special techniques are used in our experimental studies .",
    "first , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we pad some paper tissues below the soda cans , so as to modify the frictions between the two layers , as well as the friction between the bottom layer and the desk .",
    "second , a voice recorder ( hyundai , hyv - b600 ) is used to collect the audio signals of the metronomes . to differentiate the audio signals released from metronomes at different layers , we cover a small pice of cotton cloth on the front face ( the side with the speaker ) of the metronomes on the upper layer . meanwhile , to keep the mass of all the metronomes identical , metronomes on the lower layer are also attached with the same - size cloth at the reverse side . as such ,",
    "the  tick \" sounds of the upper - layer metronomes have the reduced intensity in the audio signals .",
    "we download the recorded audio signals from the recorder to the computer , from which the synchronous patterns of the metronomes will be analyzed . in the meantime , a smart cell phone with camera function is used to record the video information , which will be used as the auxiliary method to identify further the synchronous patterns .",
    "( two different patterns may have the same audio signals , as each metronome  ticks \" twice in a cycle . )",
    "the detection of synchronous patterns in coupled metronomes has long been a challenging problem in experimental studies @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors developed a sophisticated ccd acquisition system to detect the ss state , which is able to measure the synchronization relationship among the metronomes with a high precision @xcite .",
    "similar video - based techniques have been used in detecting the collective behavior of an ensemble of coupled metronomes @xcite .",
    "these techniques , however , rely heavily on the camera functions and use some modern techniques of signal analysis , making it difficult to be applied in classroom education . here",
    "we propose to detect the synchronous patterns from the audio signals , which , comparing to the previous video - based methods , is more convenient and efficient .",
    "as the metronomes have identical natural frequency and each metronome ticks twice in a cycle ( at the highest points ) , we thus can infer from the audio signals the synchronous behaviors by just listening the  rhythm \" .",
    "moreover , as the speakers of the upper metronomes are covered by cotton cloths , the signals released from the upper metronomes can be identified easily . as such",
    ", we can also detect the detailed configuration of the synchronous patterns , i.e. , which pair of metronomes in the experiment are synchronized .",

    "setting the natural frequency of the ( four ) metronomes as  allegro \" ( which corresponds to 160 ticks per minute ) , we study experimentally the formation of different synchronous patterns by the setup presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . to start",
    ", we pad @xmath4 layers of paper tissues below each can , pull the pendulums away from their equilibria by a small angle , and then release them without giving it any initial momentum . after a transient period of @xmath5 seconds , we record the audio and video signals for @xmath6 seconds .",
    "we then download the audio and video signals to the computer , and analyze synchronous patterns .",
    "this process is repeated for @xmath2 runs , and @xmath7 different synchronous patterns are observed in total , which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a - c ) .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows the ss state .",
    "the audio signals of the metronomes for this state are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a1 ) ( the lower panel ) . as the reference",

    "[ fig2](a1 ) also the audio signal taken from an isolated metronome ( the upper panel ) .",
    "it is seen that the phases of the metronomes are equally separated in the space , i.e. , by a constant phase difference of @xmath8 , showing the feature of ss @xcite .",
    "in addition , the audio signals of the upper metronomes , which have the reduced intensity , can be straightforwardly distinguished from that of the lower metronomes . for the reduced audio intensity of the upper metronomes ,",
    "more information about the synchronous patterns can be inferred .",
    "specifically , comparing with the reference signal of isolated metronome ( the upper panel ) , it is seen that the weak ( from the upper metronomes ) and strong ( from the lower metronomes ) signals are shown up alternatively with the fixed phase difference @xmath8 .",
    "we thus infer from fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) that metronomes on each layer reach anti - phase synchronization ( out of phase by @xmath9 ) , and the phase difference between the upper and lower metronomes is fixed to @xmath10 . by checking the corresponding video [ fig .",

    "[ fig2](b ) shows the generalized splay synchronization ( gss ) state , which is generated by changing the initial phases of the metronomes . in gss ,",
    "metronomes on the same layer reach anti - phase synchronization , but , different from the ss state , the phase difference between the upper ( weak audio signals ) and lower metronomes ( strong audio signals ) is locked to some value between @xmath11 and @xmath10 , showing the feature of gss @xcite .",
    "[ fig2](c ) shows the aps state , generated by another set of random initial conditions . in aps , metronomes on each layer",

    "it is worth mentioning that in ss , gss and aps , anti - phase synchronization is always established between metronomes on the same layer .",
    "the difference between the three states lies in the phase delay between the upper and lower metronomes : @xmath8 for ss , @xmath12 for aps , while @xmath13 for gss ( with the exact value varying with the initial conditions ) . in experimental studies",
    ", it is noticed that the three states are generated with different probabilities .",
    "comparing to the ss and aps states , the gss state is more easily generated .    removing the paper tissues between the cans and the desk , we observe the in - phase delay synchronization ( ipds ) state [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ] . from only the audio signals",
    ", we can not tell the difference between the ipds [ fig . [",
    "fig2](d1 ) ] and gss [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b1 ] states , as in both states the upper metronomes are delayed by a constant phase to the lower metronomes . yet , by checking the video signal , it is found that in ipds the metronomes within each layers reach in - phase synchronization , instead of anti - phase synchronization as for gss .",
    "padding more paper tissues between the cans and the lower board ( @xmath14 pieces of paper tissues ) , the ips state is observed [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](e ) ] , in which all metronomes are oscillating in step .",
    "the audio signal of ips is identical to aps , yet the video signal reveals again the difference [ fig . [ fig2](e2 ) ] .",
    "we wish to note that with the same frictions used in generating ss ( gss and aps ) , the ipds and ips states is not observed in experiment by changing the initial conditions ( for @xmath2 tries ) .",
    "to generate ipds ( ips ) , we need to adjust the frictions between the cans and the desk ( bottom board ) .",

    "meanwhile , in the present study , for the purpose of demonstration , we have employed only four metronomes and two layers , richer phenomena are expected by increasing the number of metronomes and layers .    we wish to highlight the audio - based technique used in detecting the synchronous patterns . comparing to the traditional sophisticated video - based techniques ,",

    "moreover , as the metronomes tick only at their extremes , the audio signals are featured by distinctly separated pulses , which are much larger than the noise background .",
    "this feature makes the identification of the synchronous pattern more accurate and reliable .",
    "the small trick we have used in differentiating the audio signals of the upper metronomes from the lower ones , i.e. , covering the speakers of the upper metronomes by cotton cloth , is very helpful in detecting the configuration of the synchronous patterns . without this treatment",

    "we have studied , theoretically and experimentally , the synchronization behaviors of coupled metronomes distributed on two layers . by varying the initial conditions of the metronomes and the coupling strength between the two layers , we have observed rich synchronous patterns , as well as the transition between the patterns . in particular , a new type of pattern , namely the ipds state , is observed for the first time , which is rooted in the breaking of the coupling symmetry in this layered coupling scheme . by numerical simulations",
    ", we have analyzed the basin distribution of the patterns , and investigated in detail the variation of the basins as a function of the coupling strength between the two layers , from which a global picture on the pattern transition is portrayed .",
    "additionally , a new measure technique based on audio signals has been proposed for detecting the synchronous patterns in experiment , which , comparing to the traditional video - based techniques , is more convenient and operational .",

    "<S> coupled metronomes serve as a paradigmatic model for exploring the collective behaviors of complex dynamical systems , as well as a classical setup for classroom demonstrations of synchronization phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> whereas previous studies of metronome synchronization have been concentrating on symmetric coupling schemes , here we consider the asymmetric case by adopting the scheme of layered metronomes . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we place two metronomes on each layer , and couple two layers by placing one on top of the other . by varying the initial conditions of the metronomes and adjusting the friction between the two layers , a variety of synchronous patterns are observed in experiment , including the splay synchronization ( ss ) state , the generalized splay synchronization ( gss ) state , the anti - phase synchronization ( aps ) state , the in - phase delay synchronization ( ipds ) state , and the in - phase synchronization ( ips ) state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the ipds state , in which the metronomes on each layer are synchronized in phase but are of a constant phase delay to metronomes on the other layer , is observed for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a new technique based on audio signals is proposed for pattern detection , which is more convenient and easier to apply than the existing acquisition techniques . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a theoretical model is developed to explain the experimental observations , and is employed to explore the dynamical properties of the patterns , including the basin distributions and the pattern transitions . </S>",
    "<S> our study sheds new lights on the collective behaviors of coupled metronomes , and the developed setup can be used in the classroom for demonstration purposes . </S>"
