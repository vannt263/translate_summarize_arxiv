    "the nature of the transition is rather well established . in the case of the random ising model ( rim )",
    "corresponding to @xmath8 , the transition belongs to a new universality class which is distinct from the ising universality class describing the critical behavior of the pure system .",
    "this has been clearly observed in experiments @xcite on dilute uniaxial antiferromagnets , such as fe@xmath9zn@xmath10f@xmath11 and mn@xmath9zn@xmath10f@xmath11 , in the absence of magnetic field @xcite and in monte carlo simulations of the rim , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the critical exponents are independent of the impurity concentration and definitely different from those of the pure ising universality class .",
    "field - theoretical ( ft ) studies @xcite confirm these results . the fixed point ( fp ) related to the pure ising universality class",
    "is unstable with respect to the addition of impurities and the renormalization - group ( rg ) flow is driven towards a new stable random fp that controls the critical behavior .    unlike ising systems",
    ", multicomponent o(@xmath2)-symmetric spin systems do not change their asymptotic critical behavior in the presence of random impurities . indeed , according to the harris criterion @xcite , the addition of impurities to a system which undergoes a continuous transition does not change the critical behavior if the specific - heat critical exponent @xmath12 of the pure system is negative , as is the case for any @xmath13 . from the point of view of rg theory ,",
    "the wilson - fisher fp of the pure o(@xmath2 ) theory is stable under random dilution .",
    "the presence of impurities affects only the approach to the critical regime , giving rise to scaling corrections behaving as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the reduced temperature and @xmath16 .",

    "but , in order to observe the correct exponents in magnetic systems in which the reduced temperature is usually not smaller than @xmath23 , it is important to keep into account the scaling corrections in the analysis of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the crossover behaviors that can be observed in the high - temperature phase of three - dimensional dilute spin systems .",
    "first , we consider the crossover from the gaussian fp to the stable fp of the model , i.e.  the random fp for @xmath8 and the pure @xmath24-symmetric fp for @xmath13 .",
    "such a crossover can be observed at fixed impurity concentration by varying the temperature .",
    "if @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is an appropriate ginzburg number @xcite , fluctuations are irrelevant and mean - field behavior is expected , while for @xmath27 the asymptotic critical behavior sets in .",
    "this crossover is not universal .",
    "nonetheless , there are limiting situations in which the crossover functions become independent of the microscopic details of the statistical system : this is the case of the critical crossover limit of systems with medium - range interactions , i.e.  of systems in which the interaction scale is larger than the typical microscopic scale @xcite . in this limit",
    "the crossover functions can be computed by using ft methods : for @xmath24 models precise results have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the three - dimensional massive scheme and in refs .",
    "@xcite by using the minimal - subtraction scheme without @xmath28 expansion .    in ising systems",
    "there is also another interesting crossover associated with the rg flow from the pure ising fp to the random fp . when the concentration @xmath4 is close to 1 , by decreasing the temperature at fixed @xmath4 , one first observes ising critical behavior , then a crossover sets in , ending with the expected random critical behavior . in a suitable limit",
    "in which @xmath29 this crossover is universal .",
    "the corresponding universal crossover functions can be computed by using ft methods .",
    "these crossover behaviors are investigated here by using the fixed - dimension perturbative approach in powers of appropriate zero - momentum quartic couplings .",
    "we determine the rg trajectories and the crossover functions of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath30 and of the second - moment correlation length @xmath31 , defined from the two - point function @xmath32 where the overline indicates the average over dilution and @xmath33 indicates the sample average at fixed disorder .",
    "this study allows us to compute the corresponding effective exponents and to determine several universal ratios of scaling - correction amplitudes entering their high - temperature wegner expansions . beside @xmath30 and @xmath31",
