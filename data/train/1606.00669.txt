    "the most important observable phenomena for the investigation of the solar activity are the surface magnetic fields , in particular the longest observed features : the solar active regions , sunspots , and sunspot groups .",
    "for this reason reliable documentation of the sunspot activity is of basic importance for the understanding of the solar dynamo and also for any other components of the solar activity .",
    "two parallel approaches have been established in solar research .",
    "one of them provides a single value for each day with no regard for structural properties of sunspot groups .",
    "this approach resulted in the series of international sunspot number ( issn : @xcite ) and group sunspot number @xcite .",
    "they are based on full - disc solar drawings , which can be extended back to the first telescopic observations in 1610 .",
    "these data are indispensable for the long - term studies of solar activity of the last four centuries .",
    "the issn is widely used as the main index of solar activity ; this is the reason for the recent cooperative efforts to ensure the homogeneity of this dataset @xcite .",
    "the task of the other approach is the recording of the observable properties of all active regions , primarily their sizes and positions .",
    "these databases are based on white - light full - disc photographic observations , and they play an important role in the study of spatial and temporal distributions of sunspots and active - region development . the first detailed sunspot catalog was the greenwich photoheliographic results ( gpr : @xcite ) described by @xcite and @xcite recently .",
    "the volumes of gpr contain the position and area data of all observable sunspot groups on a daily basis . in the first decades",
    ", the data of some ( not all ) individual sunspots were also published , and it also contained white - light facular data until 1955 .    when the gpr program was terminated , the international astronomical union charged the debrecen heliophysical observatory ( dezs , 1982 ) with the continuation of the program from 1977 onwards .",
    "the present article describes the current state and services of the debrecen sunspot - data programs .",
    "the core program is the debrecen photoheliographic data ( dpd ) , the first sunspot catalog containing the position and area data of all observable sunspots and sunspot groups on a daily basis ; this is the formal continuation of the gpr with higher complexity .",
    "the dpd has recently reached the total coverage of the post - gpr era , and it has been unified with the gpr . now",
    "the gpr and the dpd constitute a homogeneous dataset with three overlapping years and all of the on - line tools of dpd have been extended for the gpr .",
    "the dpd team also extended the catalog work to space - borne full - disc continuum observations .",
    "this team created sunspot and facular datasets based on the _ michelson doppler imager _",
    "( mdi ) of the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho )",
    "called soho / mdi  debrecen data ( sdd , 19962010 ) , and the datasets based on the _ helioseismic and magnetic imager _ ( hmi ) of the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) called sdo / hmi  debrecen data ( hmidd , 20102014 ) .",
    "the space - borne catalogs are even more detailed databases containing the magnetic - field data of all spots with a temporal resolution of @xmath0 1 - 1.5 hours .",
    "the included magnetic data greatly extend the possibilities for investigations because of the higher cadence and the distinction of leading and following polarities .",
    "at present , the most detailed ground - based catalog is the dpd , providing area and position data for each observable sunspot on a daily basis along with images of sunspot groups , full - disc scans and magnetograms .",
    "the dpd is mainly compiled by using white - light full - disc observations taken at dho and its gyula observing station with an archive containing more than 150,000 photoheliograms observed since 1958 .",
    "observations of a number of other observatories around all of the world help in making the catalog complete .",
    "the numerical part of the dpd contains area and position of each spot , the total areas and the mean positions of the sunspot groups , and the daily sums of the area of groups .",
    "these three kinds of data relating to spots , sunspot groups , and daily sums are organized into three kinds of rows of data .",
    "the first character of the row indicates the type of the row .",
    "if the first letter is @xmath1 , it means that the row contains data for a spot .",
    "if the first character is @xmath2 , the row contains the total areas and the mean positions of a sunspot group .",
    "if the first character is @xmath3 , the row contains daily data .",
    "the following data are available for each spot : time of observation , the noaa number of its group , the measured ( projected ) and the corrected ( for foreshortening ) areas of umbrae [ @xmath4 and the whole spot [ @xmath5 , formerly @xmath6 , latitude [ @xmath7 , longitude [ @xmath8 , distance in longitude from the central meridian [ @xmath9 , position angle [ @xmath10 , and distance from disc center [ @xmath11 expressed in solar radii .",
    "several kinds of numerical data are presented in ascii files : yearly tables for daily sums of area data ; time series of daily data ( rows @xmath3 only ) ; tables containing the whole area of sunspot groups and their mean position data ( rows @xmath2 only ) ; tables for the sunspot area and position data ( rows @xmath1 only ) ; combined datasets containing all three kinds of rows .",
    "the dpd contains of all the observable sunspots , and it also contains data for umbrae . if there is a darker part within a spot , this part can be identified as an umbra based on its intensity exclusively .",
    "the corrected area of the whole spot [ @xmath5 ] and the umbral area [ @xmath4 are measured in millionth of solar hemisphere [ msh ] .",
    "if the observed area is smaller than 0.5 msh , it is indicated with 0 msh at the measured position .",
    "a zero @xmath13 may mean that the derived @xmath13 is smaller than 0.5 msh , or the observable structure of the spot does not allow one to identify any internal pattern .",
    "if an umbra is identified within a spot , the position of the umbra is published in the row @xmath1 .",
    "otherwise , the centroid of the spot determines the position of the spot .",
    "if there is more than one umbra within a penumbra , this fact is also published . in such a case , the @xmath5 is published in the row of one of these umbrae and the rows of the other umbrae contain the ordinal number of this umbra with negative sign , which indicates that the given umbra shares a penumbra with the umbra of the ordinal number indicated with negative sign .",
    "( _ e.g. _ as can be seen in figure 3 , the umbra number 2 shares the penumbra with umbra number 1 .",
    "this fact is indicated in such a way that there is -1 in the columns of @xmath5 in the row of the umbra number 2 .",
    "it is indicated in a similar way that the umbra number 4 shares its penumbra with lots of other umbrae . )",
    "scans of sunspot groups are appended showing the spots numbered as in the numerical dataset .",
    "full - disc white - light images and magnetic observations are appended to provide the morphological and polarity information available concerning the sunspots .",
    "all of the data and images are accessible by ftp to provide an easy bulk download , but the entire material is also provided in a user - friendly interactive graphical presentation .",
    "the daily page of the on - line presentation of the data contains a schematic full - disc drawing created from the spot data of dpd and a magnetic observation . below the schematic full - disc drawing ,",
    "there is a link to open the jpg version of the original full - disc white - light observation in a pop - up window .",
    "all of the information on a sunspot group can be reached by clicking on the group number .",
    "the days can be surveyed by turning the pages both at the daily pages and at the group pages .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the full - disc images available for a day at the website of dpd and figure 3 shows an example for a page of sunspot data of dpd here .",
    "there is also an on - line mysql query at the website of the catalogs , which makes possible a quick and easy selection of the numerical data ( figure 4 ) .    ] .",
    "right panel : magnetogram or polarity drawing available for the given day.,width=453 ]                the dpd is available starting in 1974 .",
    "some of its volumes are still in a preliminary format and need a further quality check .",
    "the instrumental background for dpd catalog compilation has changed over the years @xcite .",
    "the software package called sunspot automatic measurement ( sam ) ( gyri 1998 , 2005 ) was developed to handle the scans of the ground - based photographic observations .",
    "after that , it was further developed to handle the ground - based and space - borne ccd fits images .",
    "the rate of space - borne observations included in the dpd increased in recent years .",
    "however , the ground - based observations remain essential to contribute to the completeness of the whole material .",
    "detailed analysis of the precision of the data can be found in the articles by @xcite .",
    "the soho / mdi - debrecen data ( sdd ) catalog is based on the soho / mdi continuum intensity images and magnetograms @xcite .",
    "this catalog is similar to that of dpd in its data format , image products , and on - line tool but the temporal cadence is about one hour depending on the availability of mdi observations .",
    "the novelty is that the sdd contains magnetic information because the sam is suitably modified to determine the mean line - of - sight magnetic field of umbral and penumbral parts of spots from the quasi - simultaneous magnetogram .",
    "the software automatically finds the sunspots in the solar - disc images of 1024@xmath141024 pixels , it draws their internal ( umbra ) and external ( penumbra ) contours , and it determines their positions , areas , and mean magnetic - field strength .",
    "the full - disc version of the sdd catalog ( fdsdd ) is based on these data .",
    "the spots are numbered by the computer program on the basis of their longitude , and they are not assigned to sunspot groups . in the next step ,",
    "the arrangement of spots into sunspot groups was made automatically by using the sunspot - group data of the pre - existing dpd catalog , finally , the arrangement was checked and corrected by human assistance .",
    "the procedure of checking and improving is time consuming so it is not yet complete . in spite of its partially preliminary state ,",
    "this synoptic dataset makes it possible to investigate the internal dynamics and evolution of the active regions with high time resolution",
    ".    the unique level of detail of sdd can be demonstrated with a series of images for the sunspot group noaa 10486 in figure 5 .",
    "this group produced a powerful x17.2-class flare on 28 october 2003 .",
    "figure 5 shows the last three sets of data in sdd before this flare .",
    "the schematic polarity drawing of the sunspot group in the middle column of figure 5 illustrates the data content of sdd .",
    "each image in the middle is created from the position and area data of spots derived from the observations alongside it .",
    "the spots ( and pores ) are represented by ellipses outlining approximately the spot roughly as a projection of a circle on a sphere onto a plane .",
    "the centroid of the ellipse is at the position of the visible centroid of the spot .",
    "the area of the ellipse is the projected whole spot area .",
    "the projected umbral area is represented by a smaller ellipse within the ellipse of the spot .",
    "the colors of the ellipses of umbra and penumbra show the polarities of their mean magnetic field derived from the magnetogram ( light- gray penumbra and white umbra correspond to positive polarity , while dark - gray penumbra and black umbra correspond to negative polarity ) .",
    "at least a small part of the spot is always colored in white or black ( even if @xmath13=0 ) to emphasize the polarity information . in the case of several umbrae in common penumbra , there is an umbral ellipse for each umbra at its position . in the case of mixed polarities ,",
    "the colors of umbra and penumbra show opposite polarities .",
    "the amount of data for this group is more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of dpd ; the sdd contains more than 10,000 independent ( non - redundant ) position , area , and magnetic data of spots in this group for this day ( 15 images per day ; about 120 spots in this group per image ; two position data , two area data , and two magnetic data per spot )",
    ".    19 heliographic degrees.,width=453 ]",
    "for the hmidd , the data structure and the on - line tools are very similar to those of sdd .",
    "the difference comes from the fact that the spatial resolution of hmi is larger than mdi . the 4096@xmath144096 pixels high - quality images allow measuring much smaller features with higher precision in the images . on one hand , this results in large data files with somewhat different format from that of dpd and sdd . on the other hand",
    ", it results in sunspot - group images where the numbers and indicating lines of spots are too crowded .    because of the large amount of data , the presentation of the data with a tool showing detailed information has a greater importance .",
    "the website of hmidd is extended with extra pages at the links ",
    "see sunspots with tool \" below the images in the pages of sunspot groups .",
    "this simple tool is useful to study positions and polarities of sunspots by completing the sunspot - group images in that page with additional images in high resolution and polarity drawings . in the upper panel of these pages ,",
    "the white - light image or the magnetic observation of a sunspot group can be seen depending on the viewer choice by the radio button on the right while the lower panel shows the schematic polarity drawing of sunspot group reconstructed from the hmidd data . if one moves the mouse cursor over a sunspot ( or umbra ) near its centroid in the upper or lower panel , the actual related data row of that sunspot will pop up on the row between the upper and lower panels as the data of spot ( umbra ) no .",
    "26 can be seen in figure 6 . to help browsing data , the full - disc schematic drawings reconstructed from the data are also published ( _ e.g. _ figure 7 is created from position , area , and magnetic - field strength data of 566 sunspots derived from the continuum image and magnetogram for 20140706t20:00:41ut ) .",
    "the huge amount of data in the hmidd requires that the assignment of spots to sunspot groups is processed with an automatic method exclusively .",
    "this method is mainly based on the information on sunspots and sunspot groups listed in dpd .",
    "that spot , which is not included into dpd , is assigned to the closest group of dpd if the distance is smaller than five heliographic degrees .",
    "if there are no dpd groups within this distance , the spot or the cluster of nearby spots is assigned to a newly created sunspot group with a name created from an existing noaa active - region number by adding a previously unused letter to it .",
    "the quick - look version of dpd is also based on the hmi observations . to provide daily sunspot data as soon as possible",
    ", one hmi image per day is regularly evaluated starting the workdays with this task and publishing the data within a few hours .    9 heliographic degrees in this case .",
    "before creating these images , the hmi observations are enlarged from 4096@xmath144096 pixels to 6600@xmath146600 pixels.,width=453 ]",
    "the direction of the line connecting the leading and following portions of a bipolar sunspot groups is usually tilted with respect to the solar equator @xcite .",
    "the white - light images only allow a simple method for the estimation of this angle but more reliable tilt - angle data can be determined by distinguishing between the polarities of spots .    the tilt angle is traditionally defined to range between @xmath15 and to be positive if the absolute value of the heliographic latitude of the leading part is smaller than that of the following part but other definitions are also possible ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and @xcite ) . considering the diagnostic importance of this angle ,",
    "all catalogs of dho have appendices containing the tilt angles of the sunspot groups .",
    "the dpd lacks magnetic information ; in this case the method of @xcite had to be used , in which area - weighted positions of the umbrae of leading and following portions were derived in the portions located to the west and east of the area - weighted centroid of the entire sunspot group .",
    "this procedure has also been carried out by using the whole spot area as the weight .",
    "these resulted in two sets of columns of data .",
    "the novelty of sdd and hmidd tilt - angle datasets is that they are based on two new different tilt definitions including the information of magnetic polarity of spots in addition to the traditional data . in this cases",
    ", the tilt angles also range between @xmath15 degrees but it is the polarity of the spot that determines its leading or following role instead of the position with respect to the centroid of the group . in the case of space - borne datasets , we have four tilt data values for each group , which makes it possible to select the most unambiguous cases in which these values are closer to each other than a pre - selected criterion . these tilt - angle data and their methodology are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "figure 8 shows the on - line query available for dpd and sdd tilt data showing the options for selection criteria .",
    "the gpr contained facular data besides the spot data but the dpd did not include this additional task . however , the quality of the space - borne continuum images allowed the derivation of detailed facular data in a similar way to that in which spot data are measured .",
    "the full - disc facular data both in sdd and hmidd have a similar format to that of full - disc sunspot data .",
    "the main difference is that the columns of umbral - area data are filled with zeros .",
    "the first column of magnetic data contains the line - of - site magnetic - field value at the brightest pixel within the facular contour in the intensity image . concerning the comparison of sdd and hmidd facular data ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "figure 9 shows an example for a page showing facular data .",
    "the dho hosts solar - image databases containing heritages of two former hungarian observatories .",
    "the first set of drawings was observed between 1872 and 1891 at the gyalla observatory ( now hurbanovo , slovakia ) founded by mikls konkoly - thege ( 18421916 ) @xcite .",
    "the other set of solar drawings was observed at the haynald observatory in kalocsa between 1880 and 1919 @xcite .",
    "the full set of drawings is available at the site of hungarian historical solar drawings ( fenyi.solarobs.unideb.hu/hhsd.html ) , but the selected images are also included in an interactive on - line presentation combined with the data of gpr .",
    "these drawings , which are rich in details , help us to reveal the structure of sunspots and sunspot groups in those years when there are no photographic images available .",
    "the drawings may also contain information for faculae drawn with colors different from those of spots . in a few cases ,",
    "the features above the photosphere may also be seen at the limb observed by using a spectrohelioscope .",
    "two examples for these drawings can be seen in figure 10 .",
    "the gpr contains the heliographic coordinates and total areas of the sunspot groups on a daily basis in each year between 1874 and 1976 . in the beginning",
    ", they also included the data of some individual spots but later this was abandoned .",
    "thus , only the group data were suitable to produce a homogeneous dataset for the whole gpr era .",
    "the greenwich books are available in pdf format at the site of the uk solar system data centre ( ukssdc : www.ukssdc.ac.uk/ ) .",
    "they have two types of sections of sunspot group data between 1874 and 1955 : the  ledgers \" of sunspot groups and the daily  measures \" of sunspots and faculae .",
    "the basic dataset ( 18741976 ) consists of group data in files with extension  gpr \" .",
    "it is the electronic version of gpr published at noaa national geophysical data center ( ngdc : www.ngdc.noaa.gov ) based on the ledgers .",
    "that database was compiled by ward , usaf afcrl , in the 1960s and later updated by hoyt in the 1990s .",
    "the additional dataset of solar white light faculae contains detailed daily lists of sunspots ( 18741915 ) or daily lists of sunspot groups ( 19161955 ) based on the tables of  measures \" .",
    "the summaries of total daily data are available for 19561976 with extension  sum \" . concerning the digitized datasets of gpr , see @xcite .",
    "the method of revision was mainly based on the comparison of basic files with the extension  gpr \" and the additional files called  saf \" ( spots and faculae ) .",
    "these datasets were compared to eliminate or decrease the discrepancies because of the various typographic errors of the printed or digitized versions .",
    "the comparison of various types of published or derived position and area data resulted in lists of errors , which were usually corrected after checking them against the books , or they were recalculated from the data reckoned as correct .",
    "if the discrepancy could not be resolved by checking the books , the most probable error was corrected to achieve a consistency within the given threshold . in some cases ,",
    "the correction was made after checking the data against the hhsd or mount wilson ( mw ) drawings .",
    "the main goal of our work was to improve the  gpr \" files because that dataset was suitable to be unified with dpd .",
    "however , the  saf \" files were also corrected in many cases to achieve agreement between the two types of files .",
    "we list below the types of errors or problems detected during the quality check of the data and the method used to solve the problem : if a redundant row was found in the ",
    "gpr \" file , it was deleted ( _ e.g. _ the row was a duplication , or it contained false or deviating data for a group ) . if there was a group in the  saf \" with no pair in the  gpr \" , the data of the missing group were entered into  gpr \" .",
    "if the observational date of a given group was different in the  saf \" and in the  gpr \" , the date was checked against the book and the erroneous file was corrected .",
    "if the name of the group in the  saf \" differed from its name in the  gpr \" , a similar method of correction was used .",
    "the name was different in a number of cases because the symbols ( * , * * , # , # # ) added to the group number in the book and in the  saf \" files were transformed to additional numbers in the original version of  gpr \" .",
    "these symbols were transformed to letters a , b , c , d in the revised version of  gpr \" for the years 18741915 .",
    "the names created from the carrington rotation remained unchanged in the years 19561976 .",
    "in this way , each group had a unique name in the revised  gpr \" dataset .",
    "we have also searched for outliers in the position and areal data . if the difference between the position of the group derived from the  saf \" and that in the  gpr \" was larger than one heliographic degree , we checked the error against the books .",
    "the same was made if the difference between the corrected area of a group in the  saf \" and in the  gpr \" was larger than 5 msh .",
    "we also checked whether the projected or corrected total daily area data computed from ",
    "gpr \" data were different from those contained in",

    "george b. airy , who was the astronomer royal at the royal observatory in greenwich ( rgo ) , regarded kew as a rival over this decade . finally , airy achieved the transfer of kew s photoheliograph to greenwich in august 1872 .",
    "1873 : the daily photoheliographic observations and their evaluation started at rgo . the goal was to construct a homogeneous and precise solar dataset and to provide information on solar activity for the magnetic observatory of rgo .",
    "18741913 : it was the  golden era \" of gpr based on new instruments , increasing network of contributing observatories , and publications of detailed sunspot and facular data in addition to sunspot group data , and new types of tables ( _ e.g._for recurrent sunspot groups ) .",
    "the data were published within one to three years after observations .",
    "191436 : because of the first world war , the backlog of publication increased to four to five years . in 1916 , the observers decreased the published information : the daily data only contained the mean position and the whole area of sunspot groups but sunspot data were no longer published .",
    "this resulted in a quicker publication after 1921 ; the data were published within one to two years again .",
    "193766 : the second world war caused several problems in data production starting with the data for 1937 .",
    "after the war , the photoheliograph was moved to herstmonceux from greenwich to achieve better seeing conditions .",
    "these two things together caused a large lack in various resources .",
    "thus , the publication of the gpr suffered from a large delay ( 914 years , average : 12 years ) . to decrease the time - lag ,",
    "the observers decreased the information content of gpr again , starting at 1956 the daily detailed facular data were not published any longer and the tables of sunspot groups with projected area data were omitted .",
    "after that , the delay of publication was three to nine years ( average : 5.9 years ) .",
    "196776 : in 1967 , the magnetic observatory became officially separated from rgo . in this way , the direct interest of rgo in solar observations based on research of the relationship between solar activity and geomagnetic storms ceased .",
    "however , at this time the publication of gpr was regarded as an international duty of rgo ; thus , the gpr project was continued but it had only a very low priority . in 1971 , the fundamental reorganization of rgo and the rearrangement of resources to research groups at universities started .",
    "because of these changes , the rgo had to decide to finish a number of its research programs .",
    "1976 : the termination of gpr was announced at the iau general assembly ( ga ) in grenoble ; commission 10 ( solar activity ) accepted this decision .",
    "the last volume of gpr for 197276 was published in 1980 .",
    "the dho of the hungarian academy of sciences ( has ) had already a long tradition of high - quality photoheliographic observations and precise measurement of sunspot position at this time .",
    "commission 10 encouraged the dho to undertake this task .",
    "197778 : the dho and the has formally assumed responsibility for this program in january 1977 and established collaborative work with pulkovo , kislovodsk , kodaikanal , and rgo to ensure a continuous daily sunspot record .",
    "197981 : the debrecen photoheliograph program was approved at the iau xvii ga in 1979 .",
    "the team of debrecen photoheliographic results ( dpr ) wanted to provide information on sunspots similar to or even exceeding the great content of gpr in the  golden era \" .",
    "the planned procedure was very time consuming .",
    "19821992 : in 1982 , the dho became a department of the konkoly observatory ( ko ) , budapest .",
    "the dpr1977 was only published in 1987 @xcite and dpr1978 in 1995 .",
    "19932014 : the solar community encouraged dho to speed up the process and therefore a separate project was launched to produce the dpd .",
    "its team has left out the most time - consuming components of the dpr - procedure , thus the information content of dpd got closer to that of the early gpr but it was still much more detailed , while the speed of publication of dpd gradually increased .",
    "42 volumes of dpd have been published during 23 years .",
    "the revised version of gpr has been converted to dpd format and they were published in a unified form .",
    "2015 : it was announced at the iau xxix ga that the authors of the present article , the permanent members of the dpd team , fulfilled the undertaking on sunspot database with more extended content and services than was required .",
    "2016 : at the beginning of the year , the director of the konkoly observatory decided to close the dho and its gyula observing station by the end of the year . the future of the dpd catalog is unclear at present but some kind of continuation of the catalog work is planned in the framework of the konkoly observatory .",
    "( this may mean that the links published in this article will change in the future . )",
    "it may be useful to demonstrate the research potential of the databases .",
    "their unique features enabled several recent studies that have been carried out by exploiting these advantages .",
    "data of both sunspots and sunspot groups in the same tables enable one to track the internal dynamics of the active regions . a detailed study of @xcite addresses the variation of the distances of leading  following subgroups , the leading  following asymmetry of compactness , as well as of the rates of development . a possible new activity parameter is proposed by @xcite",
    "; this method also needs the magnetic and areal data of each spot within the groups .",
    "the high temporal resolution in the last two decades is a powerful tool to refine the internal processes of active regions , all of the above - mentioned studies exploit it .",
    "the internal dynamics of sunspot groups leading to flares has been studied by @xcite by focusing on the mutual displacements of spots of opposite polarities . by combining various space - borne spot and",
    "flare data , a new tool can be developed to study the position of flares within sunspot groups @xcite .",
    "the position and size of sunspot groups can be useful to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution of small flares before major flares @xcite .",
    "the long homogeneous series of sunspot data is indispensable for studies of long - term processes .",
    "this has been exploited by @xcite in tracking the migration of solar active longitudes . after comparing the positions of flares and active longitudes",
    ", @xcite showed that the most flare - productive active regions tend to be located in or close to the active longitudinal belt .",
    "the phase lags of solar hemispheric cycles studied by @xcite also needed a dataset covering more than a century .",
    "the availability of tilt - angle data has allowed the publication of a number of articles recently .",
    "the comparison of tilt angles derived from white - light images with those of magnetograms by @xcite revealed that the latter include the contribution of facular areas , which tend to result in greater axial inclinations than the adjacent sunspots .",
    "the large amount of tilt data allowed the refinement of joy s law : @xcite showed that the refined diagram of joy s law presents a plateau in the domain around the mean latitude of the active - region belt .",
    "the debrecen data were used by @xcite as reference datasets to obtain a statistical mapping of sunspot umbral areas derived from historical solar drawings and they contributed to the validation of the historical tilt - angle data .",
    "@xcite used the dpd for investigating the north ",
    "south asymmetry of the solar dynamo by estimating poloidal - field formation from sunspot data .",
    "@xcite examined the anti - hale groups by means of the dpd website .",
    "@xcite compared the spatial distribution of sunspot butterfly diagram constructed from the dpd sunspot catalog , the dpd tilt angles , and the radial magnetic field to study polar magnetic - field reversal and surface flux transport .    by combining the dpd data with other types of data , @xcite give examples to demonstrate that the regular polar - field build - up is disturbed by surges of leading polarities that resulted from violations of joy s law at lower latitudes .",
    "@xcite investigated how tilt angle and footpoint separation of bipolar sunspot regions vary during emergence and decay by using hmidd .",
    "the debrecen data helped @xcite in developing a new method of image patch analysis of sunspots and active regions . in the studies of the solar irradiance climate data record by @xcite",
    ", the dpd will be used as an independent data source that is accessed for quality assurance of the sunspot darkening .",
    "these examples show that there is a wide range of scientific topics that can be studied in an efficient way by exploiting the data and tools presented in this article .",
    "the article presents an overview about the most complex ensemble of sunspot databases edited by the heliophysical observatory , debrecen , hungary . the aim of the team was to compile sunspot datasets containing all relevant data for studies of sunspot activity .",
    "the developing observational techniques allowed varying data contents in different time intervals , as summarized in table 1 , but the team endeavored to obtain the maximum information from all types of observations .",
    "the users of the datasets can easily carry out investigations of sunspots on large statistical samples .",
    "while the earlier types of sunspot datasets only enabled to investigate the sunspot activity globally , the present databases also make possible to study the internal dynamics of sunspot groups .",
    "the presentation of the data is user friendly and provides several tools to make easy the search and selection .",
    "the high - level data are compiled in tables but all involved images of observations are appended so the sunspot development can be tracked by stepping through the consecutive observations , while the images have links to the numerical data by clicking on the images of spots .",
    "the search is also facilitated by a mysql query .",
    "thus the database ensemble is not only the most detailed and complete documentation of the sunspot activity but also the most versatile tool to find the necessary data .",
    ".the contents of sunspot catalogs available at the debrecen observatory [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table 1 summarizes the main features of the mentioned catalogs to overview the information content of the materials of debrecen accessible at + fenyi.solarobs.unideb.hu/deb_obs_en.html .",
    "we cite the resolution of the iau ( iau transactions xvib , 107 , 1977 ) on the responsibilities of dho concerning the continuation of gpr : + -to carry out direct photographic observations at debrecen + -to organize cooperation between other observatories willing to contribute to such a project + -with the assistance of the greenwich observatory to ensure a homogeneous continuity of the gathering , reduction and publication of such data + -to ensure the archiving of the original photographs and this access to interested scientists from around the world .",
    "the present article shows that the existing materials exceed the above requirements .",
    "now the gpr and the dpd constitute a homogeneous dataset that is supported by various the on - line tools .",
    "the debrecen catalogs provide a new window of enhanced resolution to the solar activity",
