    "motor stepping , indeed , depends also on the availability of free sites of the same track ( cytoskeletal filaments and nucleic acids ) .",

    "importantly , it has been experimentally shown that the randomness of many biological systems depends on the substrate concentration  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proved that in some conditions ( see @xcite ) one can extract valuable information on the kinetic mechanisms of a single enzyme from the inverse of the randomness @xmath15 , and associate it to the number of limiting steps of the kinetic cycle  @xcite .    in this work , we present a model of interacting molecular motors endowed with internal kinetic cycles .",

    "we thus provide a relation between the stochastic kinetics of a single tracer and the formation of extended clusters of motors moving along the same track .",

    "the availability of the energy substrate , driving the enzymatic cycle and translocation step , generates anomalous dynamics both at single molecule and at collective level .",

    "this is not the case in presence of internal states as we will show below .",

    "we describe how the particles internal enzymatic kinetics affects the overall transport process at different levels , from mean quantities to temporal fluctuations and spatial dynamical effects . in a first stage",
    ", we consider a lattice with periodic boundary conditions to efficiently extract and focus on the main new properties emerging from the model .",
    "then we analyse the more realistic case of open boundary conditions , emphasise the equivalence of the emergent phenomenology with the periodic boundary case and we link our results to biologically relevant cases and potential experimental applications .      to overcome the shortages of poissonian - particle transport models , here we describe motor enzymes as interacting particles endowed with an internal kinetic cycle moving on a lattice . for the sake of simplicity , we deal with the simplest enzymatic cycle illustrated in [ [ eq::michaelis ] ] , and we consider the backward rate @xmath7 negligible with respect to the forward rate @xmath4 $ ] ; then we rename @xmath31 by @xmath32 .",
    "this is a good approximation for many biological systems , such as coarse grained representation of the ribosomal biochemical cycle  @xcite .",

    "after the translocation the particle returns to its initial , _ ground _ state . as a result of the internal kinetics , particles can progress in their stepping cycle also when spatially blocked by their subsequent neighbours .",
    "the average residence time of a single isolated particle is then given by the sum of the average time needed to make the transition to the active state and the average time needed for translocation @xmath35 + 1/\\gamma=([s]+k_m)/[s]\\gamma$ ] .",
    "hence , we recover the michaelis - menten equation for the inverse of the average residence time , where @xmath9 represents the maximal velocity of an isolated motor and the parameter @xmath36 is the michaelis constant . with these prescriptions the hopping rate @xmath16 of a poissonian particle defined in the previous section and the average hopping rate of an isolated two - state particle coincide : @xmath37 .",
    "this choice will then allow us to directly compare the two - state model to a standard exclusion process with hopping rate @xmath16 .",

    "we now numerically simulate the rescaled current @xmath30 versus the density @xmath20 of particles for the two - state model and show how the parameter @xmath25 influences the current .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix a for a detailed description of the simulation scheme .",
    "we show that in the two - state model the rescaled current is strongly affected by the parameter @xmath25 controlling the substrate concentration ( see fig .  [ fig::comparison_current]a , blue and yellow circles ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the collective dynamics of poissonian particles , which are characterised by a rescaled current @xmath30 independent of the substrate concentration ( dashed line ) .",
    "remarkably , the transport is substantially enhanced by the presence of the internal degree of freedom representing the stepping cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig::comparison_current]a ) .",
    "this behaviour is displayed for a broad range of the parameter @xmath25 and , as expected , when @xmath42 the two models coincide .",

    "[ fig::comparison_current]a shows that , when the substrate concentration is severely limiting ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 is no longer symmetric and , interestingly , the transport flux is optimised for high densities .",
    "additionally , the velocity @xmath23 is no longer linear with the density as in the case of poissonian particles , and its dependence on @xmath20 is strongly affected by the substrate availability ( fig .",
    "[ fig::comparison_current]b ) .",
    "mean - field theories have attempted to analytically describe collective models of particles with this minimal stepping cycle  @xcite .",
    "however , they exhibit serious disagreement with numerical simulations , particularly in the regime @xmath43 .",
    "although in this paper we do not intend to provide a refined mean - field theory , we show that these deviations arise from emergent correlation effects that also influence substantially the randomness of tracer particles .      after having discussed average steady - state quantities like the current and the velocity , we now turn our attention to the fluctuations of the residence time of a tracer particle .",
    "in particular , we focus on the inverse of the randomness parameter , denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "notice that this quantity is no longer able to identify mechanistic constraints on the stepping cycle as in the single - molecule case  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig::n ] shows the quantity @xmath46 measured for a tracer particle on a lattice with different overall particle densities @xmath20 , for the two - state kinetics presented above . from these results it becomes evident that the randomness , and hence @xmath46 , depends on the crowding of the lattice .",
    "first , the maximum of @xmath46 is no longer bound by the total number of kinetic steps of the motor ( which would be equal to 2 in this case ) as it occurs in the single - particle case  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig::n ] , blue circles ) .",
    "second , the values of @xmath46 for limiting substrate concentrations , i.e. for @xmath47 , do not give an indication of the substrate - binding steps , and they remarkably depend on the density @xmath20 .",
    "in the saturating substrate concentration , for @xmath42 , which corresponds to the single state tasep - like limit ( the internal state has a very short lifetime , thus it is negligible ) , @xmath46 tends towards 1 , as in a system of poissonian steppers . as a result , the meaning of @xmath46 , well defined in the single - molecule case as the number of rate limiting steps of the mechanochemical cycle , needs to be revised when considering collective transport of motors : it does not capture only features of the single - molecule kinetics , but it can provide information on the crowding and clustering of the system , as we show in the following sections . accordingly , our analysis also shows that relevant information on the local density of motors around the tracer can be extracted by measuring its randomness @xmath12 .    .",
    "different colours and symbols represents systems at different densities ( from @xmath48 to @xmath49 ) .",
    "the blue circles instead represents a system composed of a single molecule , and the blue line ( underneath the blue circles ) is the analytical value of @xmath50 obtained from eq .  [",
    "[ eq::randomness ] ] .",
    "the value of @xmath46 for an effective tasep with hopping rate @xmath16 would instead be a constant ( @xmath51 ) , for any density .",
    "[ fig::n],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we stress once more that when considering poissonian particles , one obtains @xmath51 independently from the substrate abundance , since varying @xmath16 only rescales the timescale and does not affect the stochasticity of the system . instead , by considering an additional kinetic state ,",
    "the particle residence time is no longer exponentially distributed ( as in a stochastic poissonian process ) , but the distribution can be interpreted in terms of a convolution of exponentials with typical times related to the microscopic rates of the stepping cycle of the motor  @xcite .",
    "if only part of the kinetic cycle is influenced by the presence of other enzymes on the lattice ( as in the two - state model , where only the translocation step is affected by the density of enzymes ) , the residence time distribution can be strongly conditioned by the neighbourhood occupancy , giving rise to long range spatial correlations that we study in the next section .",
    "a closer look at the system via kymographs ( snapshots of the system at consecutive times tracing the trajectories of the particles , fig .",
    "[ fig::big]a - b ) reveals the emergence of clusters and queues of active particles for substrate - limiting conditions ( @xmath52 ) and particle density @xmath53 .",
    "a more quantitative analysis shows that by changing @xmath25 , and therefore the substrate dependence , clustering increases when the substrate is limiting and the probability of finding large clusters is no longer negligible .",
    "this is clearly shown by computing the cluster distribution @xmath54 , i.e. the probability of finding a cluster of particles of size @xmath46 ( @xmath46 adjacent particles ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig::big ] we show @xmath54 versus @xmath46 for different values of @xmath25 for @xmath48 ( c ) and @xmath55 ( d ) : this probability distribution displays large exponential tails in substrate limiting conditions , i.e. for small values of @xmath25 .",
    "it also shows a minimal dispersion when @xmath25 is of order 1 , and then the large - cluster tail moderately increases for larger values of @xmath25 ( i.e. in the single state tasep - like limit ) .    as a consequence of the peculiar features of @xmath54 , the mean cluster size",
    "@xmath56 arising from this distribution exhibits a non - monotonous dependency on the substrate concentration @xmath25 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig::big]e - f . since the broadness of @xmath54 becomes smaller around @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig::big]c ) , the mean cluster size as a function of @xmath25 exhibits a minimum when @xmath57 , i.e. the average cluster is smaller than in both the substrate limiting and saturating ( tasep - like ) cases .",
    "( * a * ) and @xmath58 ( * b * ) . by decreasing the relevance of the substrate - depending internal states ( i.e. by increasing @xmath25 ) one advances on the cusp - shape curves starting from large mean cluster values as indicated by the black arrow in panel",
    "* a*. despite of the non - univocal nature of this relationship , for small values of the randomness the cluster - size can be indirectly measured by observation of the randomness and knowledge of the substrate conditions .",
    "[ fig::randomness_cluster],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the previous section we have shown that the inclusion of the enzymatic kinetic cycle , even in its simplest form , induces localized inhomogeneities of the density such as particle crowding and queuing . due to the strong non - monotonous dependence of both the randomness parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig::n ] ) and the mean cluster size ( fig .",
    "[ fig::big]e - f ) on @xmath25 , and therefore on the substrate abundance , it is interesting to plot the mean cluster size @xmath59 versus the randomness parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig::randomness_cluster ] ) .",
    "the non - monotonous dependence of the randomness on @xmath25 implies that by starting from very small values of @xmath25 and increasing it , one would eventually meet a minimum of the randomness ( maximum of @xmath46 , see fig .",
    "[ fig::n ] ) , then see the fluctuations increasing again and saturate to 1 with the type of kinetics analysed here",
    ". the non - trivial mean cluster size dependence on @xmath25 shows a similar behaviour , and by merging this information for each density one obtains the cusp - shaped curves presented in fig .",
    "[ fig::randomness_cluster ] . hence",
    ", experimental measurements of the randomness could help identifying different clustering regimes at different substrate concentrations , as fig .",
    "[ fig::randomness_cluster ] shows .",
    "strikingly , the minimum of the randomness corresponds to the minimum of the mean cluster size , tracing a link between the fluctuations of a tracer particle and the collective properties of the system .",
    "the cluster formation mechanism at low substrate seems to decrease the stochasticity ; in other words , the randomness in the limit @xmath40 is smaller than the single - molecule case ( see fig .  [ fig::n ] ) .      in this section",
    "we study the consequences of considering the model presented above with open boundary conditions , i.e. without fixing the density of particles but allowing particles to enter from one end of the lattice with rate @xmath60 , and exit from the other end with rate @xmath61 . as it is well known from the tasep - literature , this model presents boundary induced phase transitions  @xcite . when the entry rate @xmath60 is limiting the system is found in a low density ( ld ) phase , while when the exit rate @xmath61 constitutes a bottleneck the lattice is in a high density ( hd ) phase characterised by a queue of particles piling up from the end of the lattice . since exclusion interactions limit the current of particles in the bulk , a maximal current ( mc ) phase is then observed .",
    "this is characterised by a smaller density compared to the hd phase and , as the name suggests , the largest current of particles flows through the lattice ( corresponding to the maximum of the curve @xmath44 , see fig .",
    "[ fig::comparison_current ] ) . by then changing the entry and exit rates it is possible to move between these different phases . for the features of the different phases and analysis of the rich phase diagram of tasep - like models we refer the reader to other publications  @xcite . for our purposes it is useful to notice that , although the density of particles @xmath20 is no longer a system control parameter , the average occupation @xmath62 of the lattice is determined by fixing the rates @xmath60 and @xmath61 , allowing a mapping between the close and the open boundary cases .",
    "the same argument holds for the two - state model  @xcite .",
    "the average density of particles on the lattice is regulated by the triplet @xmath63 , see also the phase diagram of the system ( fig .",
    "s1 in the supporting material ) .",
    "importantly , for a fixed pair @xmath64 , by decreasing @xmath25 the open system eventually undergoes a phase transition towards the mc ( figure s1 ) .",
    "hence , if in the periodic case we isolated the effects that the stepping cycle has on the dynamics of the motors and on the local clustering for a fixed density , by changing @xmath25 in the open case we also to take in account the differences in the density induced by the boundary - controlled phase transitions .",
    "despite that , the outcomes can still be interpreted within the same framework , and one is still able to provide estimates of the crowding of the filament from measurements of the randomness parameter .",

    "[ fig::open],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as a first example we consider a crowded situation at high substrate concentrations , i.e. with the system found in the hd when @xmath25 is large , as shown in figure  [ fig::open]a . by decreasing @xmath25",
    "the inverse of the randomness @xmath46 remains constant at the beginning , then the dependence shows a steep increase when @xmath71 , as shown also in figure  [ fig::n ] for comparable densities ( gray diamonds ) in periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the system then undergoes a transition to the mc phase , causing a change in the average density @xmath62 .",
    "once the system is deep in the mc phase its average density is smaller than in the hd regime , and the randomness computed corresponds to the one calculated with a closed system for similar density at limiting substrate concentrations ( @xmath72 , between the green squares and yellow diamonds in figure  [ fig::n ] ) .",
    "the peak in @xmath46 that is present in the open boundary case is induced by the stepping cycle and it has hence the same nature of the one observed in the close boundary case .",
    "we in fact observe a reduction of the average particle cluster size in correspondence to the peak in @xmath46 and before the transition to the mc ( see fig .",
    "s2 in the supporting material ) .",
    "we note that this fact provides evidence that the periodic lattice case previously studied can already capture many of the features of the open boundary case .",
    "the second example consists of a lattice in the ld phase when the substrate is present at high concentrations , figure  [ fig::open]b . as a result of the small entry rate ( compared to the other parameters ) ,",
    "the average density @xmath62 of motors on the track is small and the exclusion interactions can at a first approximation be neglected for large @xmath25 .",
    "the plot of @xmath46 then resembles the one of the single molecule in the close boundary condition ( blue circles in figure  [ fig::n ] ) , and it presents a maximum at values @xmath71 .",
    "however , when @xmath25 decreases the lattice enters the mc regime , the density effects become evident and the inverse of the randomness increases again ( generating a minimum in @xmath46 ) to reach the values expected by the periodic boundary simulations .",
    "these two examples represent two biologically relevant situations : the first case is representative of processive motors that are slowed down by a bottleneck situated at the exit , and the second one of motors that are in excess of substrate ( e.g. high atp concentrations ) ( large @xmath25 ) in the ld phase . in particular ,",
    "the second case can be applied to ribosomes advancing on an mrna .",
    "indeed , in order to produce figure  [ fig::open ] , we have used biologically realistic parameters for the rates @xmath60 and @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 in case of mrna translation is mainly given by the abundance of cognate trna , and is smaller than 1 ( @xmath73 in _",
    "s.cerevisiae_ )  @xcite . from figure",
    "[ fig::open]b one can then speculate that @xmath25 might have an important role in regulating the randomness of the ribosomes traffic and therefore the noise in protein synthesis at the level of translation .",
    "we are aware that inhomogeneities in the sequence could further influence the randomness of ribosomes . here",
    "we consider the case in which the nucleotide sequence does not have relevant bottlenecks , so that the dynamics can be considered , in first approximation , uniform along the lattice . in this work",
    "we have decided to only treat the homogeneous case to better separate the effects of the lattice inhomogeneities and the ( more counterintuitive ) ones induced by the motor s stepping cycle .    as in the periodic boundary case",
    "one could imagine to extract information on the filament crowding by the measurement of the randomness of a tracer . in figure",
    "[ fig::open]c we have therefore represented the randomness as a function of the average density @xmath62 .",
    "interestingly , other than direct measurements of the randomness of a molecular motor by , e.g. quantum dots  @xcite , in the case of protein synthesis one can also relate this quantity to the noise in gene expression .",
    "the results presented above are valid for highly processive motors entering on one side of the track and being depleted at the other end . however , in order to consider finite processivity one should consider attachment and detachment of motors at any position along the lattice  @xcite . while we would expect the main phenomenology presented here to hold with those extensions ( the randomness depending on local density ) , in order to provide quantitative predictions one should adapt the properties ( number of states and transition rates ) of the stepping cycle to the case of interest . moreover ,",
    "if considering finite processivity motors , the detachment could depend on the biochemical state of the motor  @xcite ; we expect that this can give rise to many variations of the model whose analysis is out of the scope of our present work .",
    "the several biochemical reactions involved in a single move of an enzyme define its kinetic cycle , which has been thoroughly studied at a single - molecule level both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . despite significant progress of single - molecule techniques ,",
    "how the internal stepping dynamics affects collective transport of molecular motors still remains an outstanding open question in molecular and cellular biology .    in this work",
    "we have unveiled features of collective enzyme kinetics and shown emergent ( temporal and spatial ) correlations induced by internal molecular kinetics , with a particular emphasis on biologically driven transport process by processive enzymes .",
    "we have thus focused on the collective properties of processive enzymes on the same biological track ( e.g. motor proteins on a cytoskeletal filament ) and first shown that collective models of unidimensional transport such as the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) do not capture the complexity and the interplay between the individual particle s stepping cycle and the macroscopic phenomenology of the system .",
    "models built on single particle steps without internal states ( unstructured poissonian walkers ) are characterised by stationary states that neither catch the well known dependence on the substrate concentration of , for example , the fluctuations of the particles residence times ( the randomness ) , nor exhibit the rich phenomenology associated with the fluctuations of the residence time and also the emerging spatial correlations .    to bridge the gap between single - molecule and multi - particle models",
    "we have extended a prototypical unidimensional transport process ( the tasep ) by explicitly incorporating an intermediate state defining a stepping cycle on each particle .",
    "the inclusion of the enzymatic stepping cycles to a simple driven lattice gas model has now allowed us to study the role of the kinetic cycle ( and , e.g. , its substrate dependence ) at a collective scale ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . as a proof of principle",
    "we have studied the simplest kinetic cycle , a michaelis - menten - type with an irreversible substrate dependent transition and a translocation step ( which can be easily generalised to more complex kinetics schemes ) .",
    "this unsophisticated stepping cycle is sufficient to give rise to complex dynamical phenomena that reproduce the phenomenology of experimental results .",
    "moreover , our approach is also justified by the presence of two major timescales in the stepping in many molecular motors  @xcite .",
    "we have first highlighted and revisited previous results : ( i ) the stepping cycle can enhance the current of particles if compared to the standard tasep , ( ii ) the optimal transport capacity is obtained for higher densities , and ( iii ) at low substrate abundance the velocity @xmath23 of a tracer particle depends in a nonlinear way on the density .",
    "these predictions could be verified by _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ experiments of processive molecular motors at low atp concentrations , similar to the ones performed in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the phenomenology observed in the experiments , including the substrate - dependent fluctuations of the residence times  @xcite , is recovered by the inclusion of stepping cycle kinetics .",
    "here we have shown that the randomness of a tracer particle strongly depends on the crowding of the system , and significantly deviates from the single - molecule behaviour .",
    "we immediately noticed that particles are no longer characterised by poissonian exponential residence times , whose distribution can be expressed by a convolution of exponentials .",
    "these distributions also bear some similarities to the gamma waiting times distributions characteristic of semi - markov processes ; the fact that only part of the stepping cycle is influenced by the crowding of the system can indeed be seen as a peculiar memory property of the individual particles  @xcite .",
    "thus , in contrast to the case of an isolated molecule , the inverse @xmath46 of a randomness parameter does not give the number of limiting steps of the enzyme kinetics anymore .",
    "interestingly , we have found that the crowding remarkably affects measurements of the randomness , in particular at low and medium substrate concentrations , and @xmath46 is no longer bound by the number of kinetic steps .    in the periodic system",
    "we have focused on the time evolution of the system via the kymographs and obtained signatures of relevant particle clustering at low substrate abundance .",
    "we have shown that when the system lacks the resources necessary to force a particle to the excited state ( @xmath40 ) , the limiting substrate - dependent rate has the remarkable effect of generating moving and spatially localised queues of particles ( clusters ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results previously discussed : particles trapped in a queue can in fact use the time to undergo a transition to the active state , and then move almost simultaneously , producing a larger current compared to standard exclusion processes .",
    "clustering at low @xmath25 also explains why @xmath46 , effectively interpreted as the number of limiting steps , is larger than 1 in such conditions .",
    "in fact , a cluster of particles can be thought of as an extended object that necessitates more than one transition before undergoing a translocation step .",
    "moreover , from a theoretical point of view , we stress that the mean cluster size @xmath56 remains finite , and there is no transition towards a unique extensive cluster as displayed by other models  @xcite .    in order to make a more appropriate connection to biological systems , we have also analysed the model in the open boundary case .",
    "although the model in open boundaries also presents phase transitions influencing the randomness and the crowding of the system , the framework and the results obtained in the periodic case remain valid .",
    "since a given set of entry and exit rates determines the average density on the track , we can roughly map the open system to the periodic one .",
    "further extensions are out of the scope of the present work .",
    "on biological grounds , we present a clear mechanism that allows processive enzyme like motor proteins to spontaneously form clusters at low concentrations of energy resources like atp , and at the same time to improve the overall transport at high densities .",
    "in addition , we have shown that there is a clear link between randomness measurements and local density , and therefore suggest that the evaluation of the randomness by tracer particles might be used as a prompt to detect the crowding on the track . using an individual tracer might constitute an alternative strategy to provide quantitative density measurements .",
    "this methodology is particularly relevant in crowded regimes in which the relation between fluorescence and motor density is not linear .",
    "the same arguments can be used to many biological tight - coupled processive machines , as ribosomes translating an mrna , which are known to usually work in the regime @xmath40 ( here the substrate is mainly determined by the abundance of cognate trnas ) . in this case",
    "the randomness contributes to noise in gene expression , which might be used as an indirect measure .",
    "this study opens to the interpretation of tracing particle statistics of experiments _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite and it allows us to bridge the gap between refined single - molecule theories ( e.g. ratchet models  @xcite ) and coarse - grained cooperative models of molecular motors , which are recovered in particular conditions , in order to understand the principles of motor collective coordination .    the authors would like to thank i.  stansfield for the useful discussions .",
