    "the hawking radiation is an important quantum effect in black hole physics but , this one is enigmatic because at quantum level black holes are not black completely since these emit radiation with a temperature given by @xmath1 @xcite , contrary to the classical context where it is believed that anything can escape from them .",
    "the originated thermal radiation at the black hole event horizon is emitted into surrounding spacetime with the consequence that the semiclassical approach for a black hole exhibit that it slowly loose its mass and eventually evaporates . at the event horizon",
    "the hawking radiation is in fact blackbody radiation .",
    "however , this radiation still has to traverse a non - trivial curved spacetime geometry before it reaches after all to an observer where it is detected .",
    "the surrounding spacetime thus works as a potential barrier for the radiation giving a deviation from the blackbody radiation spectrum , as it is detected by an asymptotic observer @xcite .",
    "the greybody factors are the probabilities for outgoing waves in the @xmath2-mode to reach infinity .",
    "the horizon which filter the initially blackbody spectrum emanating from the horizon @xcite .",
    "if one integrates the greybody factors over all spectra , the total black hole emission rate is obtained .",
    "moreover , if they are constant the black hole emission spectrum would be exactly that of a blackbody radiation .",
    "this is the non - triviality of the greybody factor which leads to deviations of blackbody emissions and the consequent greybody radiation @xcite .",
    "essentially , such radiation possesses a thermal character and inevitably black holes slowly evaporate .",
    "furthermore , in the understanding of the event horizon for a black hole , the hawking radiation plays an important role providing clues about the quantum structure of gr . in order to study the hawking radiation we need to allow quanta to fall into the hole .",
    "the absorption cross section for low energy particles in @xmath3 dimensions consider a particle to be a massless minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "the cross section equals the area of the black hole @xcite .",
    "additionally , it was shown in @xcite that for all spherically symmetric black holes the low energy cross section for massless minimally coupled scalar fields is always the area of the horizon .",
    "nevertheless , contrary to the existing results , we show in this work that there is a range of modes which contribute to the absorption cross section in the zero - frequency limit .",
    "a well known fact to be mentioned that in four dimensions the einstein tensor is the only symmetric and conserved tensor depending on the metric and its derivatives , which is linear in the second derivatives of the metric .",
    "the invariant action that gives rise to these fields equations is the einstein - hilbert action with cosmological constant @xmath4 . alike , in higher dimensions",
    "the lanczos - lovelock ( ll ) action @xcite which is non - linear in the riemann tensor , gives rise also to second - order field equations .",

    "black holes geometries for nontrivial topologies of the tranverse section was performed in @xcite .",

    "the conditions that the metric ( [ dtopologicalmetric ] ) must fulfill in order to have an appropriate black hole solution have been extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "if we specialize the solution ( 4 ) for @xmath36 , the horizon geometry is described by a negative constant curvature with @xmath37 . in consequence",
    "the metric ( 4 ) reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the line element of a @xmath41dimensional surface , @xmath42 . clearly , this metric has a horizon at @xmath43 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this solution not necessarily describe a black hole .",
    "in fact , if the transverse section @xmath44 has the topology @xmath45 , the metric ( [ metric2 ] ) does not represent a black hole",
    ". it could be the case provided suitable identifications are performed on @xmath46 @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , to gain insight into the quantum nature of black holes",
    "the kinematical properties provide relevant clues about their semiclassical aspects . in this spirit , the scalar perturbations on a massless black hole are dictated by a massive non - minimally coupled scalar field , @xmath47 , propagating in the vicinity of the massless black hole .",

    "the hypergeometric coefficients , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are defined as follows @xmath85 with @xmath86 being a non - integer , and @xmath87 without loss of generality we choose the negative sign for @xmath88 .",
    "one interesting feature to notice is that the function ( [ kz ] ) has three regular singular points at @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "then , the solution @xmath92 is @xmath93 notice that in the neighborhood of the horizon , @xmath89 , by using the property @xmath94 @xcite , the function @xmath92 acquires the form @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the scalar field @xmath47 behaves as @xmath96 this expression is quite general as it follows from ( [ rz ] ) and notice that @xmath47 represents both ingoing and outgoing waves . to be able to interpret to the scalar field as being only ingoing waves at the horizon the constant @xmath82 must be eliminated .",
    "the general radial solution with boundary conditions at the horizon can then be written as @xmath97 in order the implement suitable boundary conditions at infinity ( @xmath90 ) for the solution ( [ horizonsolution4d ] ) we find convenient to use the kummer s relation for the hypergeometric functions ( see for example , @xcite ) the radial function is therefore given by @xmath98~,\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that @xmath99 besides the limit of @xmath92 when @xmath100 .",
    "another way at looking at the radial solution when @xmath101 at the asymptotic region , is from the wave equation ( [ waveequation1 ] ) @xmath102 where we have used the asymptotic behavior of @xmath72 and @xmath103 , and the ansatz @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "the solution to this equation is given in terms of bessel functions @xcite @xmath106~,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are integration constants .",
    "it is straightforward to simplify the radial solution by using the expansion of the bessel function for small arguments , namely @xcite @xmath110 a short calculation shows that the asymptotic radial solution exhibit the polynomial form @xmath111 where we have introduced the constants @xmath112 and @xmath113 , also we used @xmath114 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was discussed that a scalar field with asymptotic behavior , similar that eq .  ( 22 ) , generically leads to an unstable state ( the so called , big crunch singularity ) which is a clearly sign of nonlinear instability .",
    "however , in order to induce such instability , this modify the boundary conditions that scalar field must satisfy at infinity , ref .",
    "although the modified boundary conditions preserve the full set of asymptotic ads symmetries , and allow for a finite conserved energy to be defined , this energy can be negative .",
    "we notice , that the imposition of regularity condition on the radial function ( [ rasymp1 ] ) at the infinity implies @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "this is in agreement with the condition for any effective mass in order to have a stable asymptotic ads spacetime in @xmath0 dimensions , @xmath117 @xcite which sets requirements on the nonminimal coupling constant , once the bare mass of the scalar field and the dimensions are fixed .",
    "besides , @xmath118 , for @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , for @xmath121 .",
    "for this reason @xmath86 can not be an integer , because the gamma function is singular at that point and the regularity conditions are not satisfied .",
    "we now take advantage of the inherent symmetry that the radial solution possesses in the asymptotic region .",
    "more specifically , we have the freedom to choose the form of the constant @xmath122 since by changing @xmath123 to @xmath124 this solution is unchanged .",
    "comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ rinfinity ] ) and ( [ rasymp1 ] ) , regarding @xmath125 , allows us to immediately to read off the coefficients @xmath126 and @xmath127 , @xmath128",

    "our numerical analysis needed of specific choices for the aforementioned constant @xmath143 . to this respect we made allowance for the currently accepted discussion for the selection of the parameter @xmath143 . on the one hand ,",

    "in addition , it has been reported that this freedom in the choice of @xmath143 as a numerical factor is usually set up by imposing appropriate physical conditions @xcite .",
    "thus , according to our concern we proceeded to choose the parameter @xmath143 in such way that either the values of the greybody factors , reflection and transmission coefficients represent an acceptable physical situation . in this sense",
    "we employed @xmath143 as a free parameter and we use it to plot the reflection coefficient ( see fig .",
