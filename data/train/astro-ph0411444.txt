    "complete samples of members of nearby young associations are important for constraining the origin and evolution of these populations @xcite and for providing targets for detailed studies of star and planet formation @xcite . over the last few years",
    ", two of the nearest known groups of young stars ( @xmath10  pc ) have been found surrounding the late - b stars @xmath0  cha @xcite and @xmath1  cha @xcite through astrometric , x - ray , and optical observations .",
    "these associations exhibit similar ages in the range of 3 - 10  myr @xcite and may have formed in the same molecular cloud complex as the sco - cen ob association @xcite .",
    "since the initial 13 members were presented by @xcite , the known membership of @xmath0  cha has grown to a total of 18 systems through spectroscopy of candidates selected from optical images and data from the usno - b1 and two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogs @xcite .",
    "these sources extend out to a radius of @xmath11 and exhibit a hint of mass segregation in which the less massive members tend to reside on the outskirts of the association .",
    "the more recently identified group of stars near @xmath1  cha consists of five systems within a radius of @xmath12 , one of which has at least five components @xcite .    to check for the presence of an extended low - mass population in @xmath0  cha beyond the @xmath3 radius of the survey from @xcite ,",
    "i have performed a new search for low - mass stars and brown dwarfs out to @xmath2 .",
    "i have also conducted a similar survey of an area within @xmath3 of @xmath1  cha . in this paper ,",
    "i select candidate members of the two associations through color - magnitude diagrams composed of data from denis and 2mass (   [ sec : ident ] ) , measure their spectral types and assess their youth (   [ sec : class ] ) , evaluate the completeness of the surveys (   [ sec : complete ] ) , place the known members of @xmath1  cha on the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram (   [ sec : hr ] ) , and discuss the implications of this work (   [ sec : dis ] ) .",
    "to search for new members of the @xmath0  cha association , @xcite constructed a color - magnitude diagram of @xmath13 versus @xmath14 from the denis second release and the 2mass point source catalog , selected candidate members , and obtained spectroscopy to distinguish between field stars and bonafide members .",
    "they considered an area within a radius of @xmath3 centered at @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( j2000 ) .",
    "two regions within that radius were not available from the denis second release , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : mapeta ] . in this work ,",
    "i repeat their analysis for a larger field with a radius of @xmath2 . whereas @xcite used a diagram of @xmath17 versus @xmath14 only for evaluating completeness ,",
    "i include it with @xmath13 versus @xmath14 in the selection of candidates because the @xmath14 and @xmath18 data from 2mass are available for the entire survey field , unlike @xmath19 from the denis second release , which covers only half of the field .",
    "the diagrams of @xmath13 versus @xmath14 and @xmath17 versus @xmath14 are shown in figures  [ fig : ik ] and [ fig : hketa ] .",
    "field stars identified with spectroscopy in previous studies are omitted from both diagrams .",
    "i plot the 10  myr isochrone from @xcite for masses of 0.015 to 1  @xmath5 at a distance of 97  pc @xcite .",
    "this isochrone was converted to photometric magnitudes from predicted effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities in the manner described by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : ik ] , i include the boundary from @xcite for separating candidate members of @xmath0  cha from likely field stars . in figure",
    "[ fig : hketa ] , sources near the low - mass end of the isochrone that appear as galaxies in the digitized sky survey have been excluded .",
    "unlike @xcite , i consider only candidates at low masses because the goal of this work is the detection of low - mass stars or brown dwarfs in the association beyond the previous search radius . in figure",
    "[ fig : ik ] , three candidate members have @xmath20 , corresponding to spectral types later than m4 and masses less than 0.2  @xmath21 for association members . the faintest and reddest candidate is well below the 10  myr isochrone , and thus is a marginal candidate .",
    "the position of this star in figure  [ fig : hketa ] is even more indicative of a field star , but it is nevertheless included in my spectroscopic sample .",
    "meanwhile , the other two @xmath13 candidates appear as promising candidates in figure  [ fig : hketa ] , one of which is outside of the limits of the diagram at @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this source also exhibits an excess in @xmath24 versus @xmath17 . for the portion of the survey field",
    "unavailable at @xmath19 , the diagram of @xmath17 versus @xmath14 reveals two additional candidates at @xmath25 ( type@xmath26m5 , @xmath27 ) , one at @xmath28 and @xmath29 and one at @xmath28 and @xmath30 .    for my survey of the @xmath1  cha association ,",
    "i consider the area within a radius of @xmath3 surrounding the star @xmath1  cha  ab . this field is indicated in figure  [ fig : mapeps ] , where i include the regions imaged with _ chandra _ by @xcite and the known association members listed in that study .",
    "because photometry from denis is unavailable for most of the survey field , i use only the diagram of @xmath17 versus @xmath14 from 2mass for identifying candidate members , which is shown in figure  [ fig : hkeps ] . because of the crowded nature of the hd104237 multiple system , 2mass measurements have large uncertainties for the d component and are unavailable for b , c , and e. in this work , i do not use the 2mass data for d. i also exclude the data for a because of the possibility of contamination by d. in figure  [ fig : hkeps ] , i plot the 10  myr isochrone from @xcite for a distance of 114  pc , which is the average _ hipparcos _ value for @xmath1  cha  ab and hd104237a . at colors of @xmath25 , three stars have positions in figure  [ fig : hkeps ] that are indicative of membership in the association , one of which also exhibits an excess in @xmath24 versus @xmath17 , as shown in figure  [ fig : jhhk ] .",
    "table  [ tab : log ] summarizes long - slit spectroscopy of the five candidate members of @xmath0  cha , the three candidate members of @xmath1  cha , and the five late - type members of @xmath1  cha from @xcite .",
    "the observing and data reduction procedures are the same as those described by @xcite .",
    "low - resolution spectra of the eight candidates and the previously known members of @xmath1  cha are displayed in figure  [ fig : ec ] .",
    "high - resolution spectra near the li line at 6707    for three of these candidates and the field m dwarf gl  402 are shown in figure  [ fig : li ] .",
    "i measured spectral types and assessed membership for the eight candidate members of @xmath0  cha and @xmath1  cha by applying the methods of classification described by @xcite for a similar set of data in chamaeleon  i. low - resolution spectra of the @xmath0  cha candidates are shown in figure  [ fig : ec ] .",
    "one of these stars exhibits the absorption in the cn bands that is a defining feature of carbon stars .",
    "this object is the @xmath0  cha candidate with an excess in the @xmath24 and @xmath17 colors relative to m dwarfs .",
    "red near - ir colors of this kind are typical of carbon stars @xcite .",
    "the other four candidates in @xmath0  cha have m - type spectra .",
    "three of these stars are clearly field m dwarfs rather than young m - type members of the association based on their strong na  i and k  i absorption lines .",
    "these features in the spectrum of the other m - type star , 2mass  j08283329 - 7754014 , are stronger than expected for a young source , but do not definitively establish it as a field dwarf .",
    "therefore , i obtained a higher resolution spectrum to check for the presence of li absorption , which is a signature of youth for m - type stars .",
    "absorption in li is absent in the spectrum of this star in figure  [ fig : li ] , demonstrating that it is a field dwarf .",
    "astrometry , photometry , and spectral types for these @xmath0  cha candidates are listed in table  [ tab : field ] .",
    "two of the three candidate members of @xmath1  cha , sources 10 and 12 in table  [ tab : mem ] , exhibit evidence of youth in the form of weak k  i and na  i absorption lines and li absorption , as shown in figures  [ fig : ec ] and [ fig : li ] . the k  i and na  i transitions are not clear indicators of surface gravity at the spectral type of the third candidate , @xmath1  cha  11 . in addition",
    ", the signal - to - noise of the high - resolution spectrum of this source ( not shown ) is too low for a useful measurement of li .",
    "however , the intensity of emission in h@xmath6 ( @xmath31   ) , the presence of emission in forbidden transitions ( [ o  i ] , [ o  ii ] , [ n  ii ] ) , and the presence of a @xmath7-band excess in figure  [ fig : jhhk ] are signatures of accretion , outflows , and disks , respectively , and thus conclusively demonstrate the youth of this object .",
    "these properties , particularly the forbidden line emission , are rare for stars as old as this association ( @xmath32  myr ,   [ sec : hr ] ) .",
    "astrometry , photometry , spectral types , and evidence of membership for these three new young stars and the nine members of @xmath1  cha from @xcite are compiled in table  [ tab : mem ] .",
    "the mass completeness of my survey of @xmath0  cha and @xmath1  cha is easily evaluated with the diagrams of @xmath17 versus @xmath14 in figures  [ fig : hketa ] and [ fig : hkeps ] . in these diagrams ,",
    "i include the completeness limits of the 2mass photometry , which are taken to be the magnitudes at which the logarithm of the number of sources as a function of magnitude departs from a linear slope and begins to turn over ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) . the data in figures  [ fig : hketa ] and [ fig : hkeps ] in conjunction with the 10  myr isochrone from @xcite",
    "demonstrate that the survey of these associations is complete for @xmath35 , corresponding to @xmath36 and m5@xmath37type@xmath37l0 .",
    "undiscovered members may exist at higher masses , except in the area in @xmath0  cha considered by @xcite and in the _ chandra _ fields from @xcite ; the former survey was complete for @xmath38 and the latter detected members down to the @xmath39 , which is the upper limit of the completeness in this work .",
    "i now estimate effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities for the previously known members of @xmath1  cha from @xcite and the three new young stars found in this survey , place these data on the h - r diagram , and use theoretical evolutionary models to infer masses and ages . in the following analysis ,",
    "standard dwarf colors are taken from the compilation of @xcite for types earlier than m0 and from the young disk populations described by @xcite for types of m0 and later .",
    "the ir colors from @xcite are transformed from the johnson - glass photometric system to the cit system @xcite .",
    "near - ir colors in the 2mass and cit photometric systems agree at a level of @xmath40  mag @xcite .",
    "for the objects in my spectroscopic sample , extinctions have been estimated from the spectra in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "i computed an extinction for @xmath1  cha ab from the excess in @xmath24 relative to the dwarf value at its spectral type . for hd104237a ,",
    "i adopted the extinction of @xmath41 from @xcite .",
    "photometry and spectroscopy of the b and c components of hd104237 are not available because of their proximity to the primary . as a result , estimates of extinctions , temperatures , and luminosities are not possible for these two stars .",
    "spectral types of m0 and earlier are converted to effective temperatures with the dwarf temperature scale of @xcite . for spectral types later than m0",
    ", i use the temperature scale that was designed by @xcite to be compatible with the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "bolometric luminosities are estimated by combining a distance of 114  pc , bolometric corrections described in @xcite , and a broad - band magnitude , preferably @xmath42 .",
    "however , because 2mass measurements are uncertain or unavailable for the components of hd104237 (   [ sec : ident ] ) , i have computed luminosities from @xmath43-band magnitudes for a @xcite , d , and e @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the b component of @xmath1  cha  ab to the 2mass @xmath42 magnitude has been subtracted before deriving the luminosity by adopting the magnitude difference of 0.67 measured at @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the effective temperatures , bolometric luminosities , and adopted spectral types for the members of @xmath1  cha are listed in table  [ tab : mem ] .    the temperatures and luminosities for the members of @xmath1  cha can be interpreted in terms of masses and ages with theoretical evolutionary models . after considering the available sets of models , @xcite concluded that those of @xcite for @xmath45 and @xcite and @xcite for @xmath46 provided the best agreement with observational constraints .",
    "the members of @xmath1  cha from @xcite and the three new young stars from this work are plotted with these models on the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] . for the k and m type stars ,",
    "these data and models imply an age of @xmath32  myr .",
    "when the sequence in figure  [ fig : hr ] is compared to the one for @xmath0  cha from @xcite , no difference in age between the two associations is detectable below a solar mass .",
    "however , @xcite found that the early - type stars @xmath1  cha  a and hd104237a exhibit younger ages than the less massive members with the models of @xcite .",
    "after updating the h - r diagram from @xcite with a new spectral type measurement for hd104237a , @xcite found that this star exhibits an older age on the isochrones of @xcite that is closer to the values exhibited by the low - mass members .",
    "meanwhile , with the models adopted in this work , i find that that @xmath1  cha  a and hd104237a remain younger than the low - mass stars , even with the revised spectral type for hd104237a .",
    "@xcite have suggested that @xmath1  cha  a could be an unresolved binary , which would explain its elevated luminosity and young apparent age on the h - r diagram .    among the three new young stars from this survey , @xmath1  cha 10 and 12 have masses of 0.25 and 0.09",
    "@xmath21 according to the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "the spectral type of m2.25 for @xmath1  cha 11 corresponds to a mass of 0.45  @xmath21 at the age of the association . however , the derived luminosity of this object is 30 times lower than expected for an association member at its spectral type , placing it below the main sequence .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the anomalously low luminosity estimate for @xmath1  cha 11 .",
    "it could be a young star at a distance of 0.5 - 1  kpc in the background of the @xmath1  cha association or a member of @xmath1  cha that is occulted by a circumstellar structure , in which case the observed photometry measures only scattered light and produces an underestimate of the luminosity . in the latter scenario , preferential occulting of the central star relative to the line emitting regions",
    "could also account for the fact that this star has the largest equivalent width of h@xmath6 emission among the known members and is the only one to show forbidden line emission .",
    "indeed , the emission - line spectrum and photometry of @xmath1  cha 11 closely resemble those of known edge - on disks @xcite .",
    "at the conclusion of a search for new members of the @xmath0  cha association , @xcite noted that among the known members , the three least massive objects had the largest angular separations from the center of the association ( @xmath47 ) , which suggested that undiscovered low - mass stars and brown dwarfs might be located beyond the radius of @xmath3 for their survey field .",
    "similar results were presented independently by @xcite . in this work ,",
    "i have presented a survey of a larger area out to @xmath2 that is complete for members at @xmath48 to 0.015 .",
    "no new members have been found , indicating the absence of an extended low - mass population out to four times the radius of the association s known members .",
    "@xcite recently identified a new stellar group associated with the star @xmath1  cha at a similar distance and age as the @xmath0  cha cluster .",
    "they used optical and x - ray imaging to search for members of this association down to a limit of @xmath39 across an area of @xmath49  arcmin@xmath50 , arriving at census containing five stellar systems . in this work ,",
    "i have performed a search for new members of the @xmath1  cha association over a larger field out to a radius of @xmath3 that is complete for low - mass star and brown dwarfs at @xmath48 to 0.015 .",
    "this survey has uncovered three new young stars with spectral types of m2.25 , m3.75 , and m5.75 and masses of 0.45 , 0.25 , and 0.09  @xmath21 .",
    "the latter object was within the area searched by @xcite but was not found in that survey , probably because it was just below the detection limits of those optical and x - ray observations .",
    "the m2.25 star exhibits strong h@xmath6 emission , forbidden line emission , and a @xmath7-band excess .",
    "in addition , this star is much fainter than expected for its spectral type , indicating that it is probably seen in scattered light . if optical photometry had been available for this survey of @xmath1  cha and had been used in one of the color - magnitude diagrams for selection of candidate members , this object probably would have appeared subluminous , just as on the h - r diagram , and thus would have been rejected as a field star .",
    "instead , the @xmath7-band excess of this source made it sufficiently red in the one color - magnitude diagram considered here , @xmath17 versus @xmath14 , that it was selected as a candidate even at its suppressed magnitude .",
    "any objects of this kind in the @xmath0  cha field surveyed by @xcite at optical and ir bands probably would have been rejected as field stars .",
    "finally , based on their youth and proximity to the association members from @xcite , it appears likely that the three stars found in this survey are members of @xmath1  cha .",
    "however , additional data , such as radial velocity measurements , would be useful for firmly establishing that they are members of the @xmath1  cha group rather than part of a larger - scale population of young stars @xcite .",
    "no brown dwarfs have been found in this survey of the @xmath0  cha and @xmath1  cha young associations . as @xcite concluded for their survey of a smaller field toward @xmath0  cha ,",
    "the absence of detected brown dwarfs in these associations is roughly consistent with the relative numbers of stars and brown dwarfs observed in nearby star - forming regions like taurus and ic  348 @xcite , which exhibit only @xmath8 and @xmath9 brown dwarfs above 0.02  @xmath21 in samples at at the sizes of those in @xmath0  cha and @xmath1  cha .",
