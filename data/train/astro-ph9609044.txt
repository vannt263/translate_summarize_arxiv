    "supernova remnants ( snr ) are believed to be responsible for accelerating particles to energies of at least 100 tev ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and a fraction of the accelerated particles would interact within the supernova remnant and produce gamma  rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations above 100 mev by the egret instrument on the compton gamma ray observatory have found gamma ray signals associated with at least two supernova remnants  ic  443 and @xmath0  cygni ( @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence for acceleration in snr comes from the recent asca observation of non - thermal x  ray emission from sn  1006 ( @xcite ) .",
    "reynolds ( 1996 ) and mastichiadis ( 1996 ) interpret the latter as synchrotron emission by electrons accelerated in the remnant up to energies as high as 100 tev .    in the diffuse galactic background the characteristic @xmath1 peak at 70 mev is clearly evident .",
    "the power - law spectra , dominated by bremsstrahlung , contribute @xmath2 at 1 gev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1 peak is not so clearly visible , however , in the spectra of ic  443 and @xmath0  cygni , possibly due to the larger error bars .",
    "however , this may instead suggest larger bremsstrahlung and inverse compton ( ic ) contributions , and a correspondingly higher electron to proton ratio than in galactic cosmic rays . from detailed modeling of the gamma - ray spectra of ic  443 and",
    "@xmath0  cygni it should be possible to determine the relative contributions of @xmath1 decay , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton scattering to these spectra , and thereby to obtain information about the conditions in these sources .",
    "this would also allow a better determination of the expected extrapolation of the egret spectra for these sources to the tev energy range .",
    "gamma rays are produced by electrons in bremsstrahlung interactions , and by inverse compton interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( @xcite ) , with the diffuse galactic infrared / optical radiation , and with the radiation fields of the remnant itself .",
    "protons produce gamma rays through the decay of neutral pions produced in proton  nucleus collisions .",
    "drury , aharonian & vlk ( 1993 ) calculated the @xmath1 decay gamma ray flux expected from supernova remnants due to interactions of accelerated cosmic ray nuclei with matter in the remnant .",
    "they calculated the expected flux as a function of supernova age and showed that a number of remnants should be detectable above 100 mev .",
    "mastichiadis ( 1996 ) has included synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering on the cosmic microwave background , and shown that synchrotron radiation by directly accelerated electrons is probably responsible for the non - thermal x ",
    "rays observed in sn  1006 .",
    "mastichiadis also showed that snr could produce a flux at tev energies by inverse compton scattering which is comparable to that predicted for pion production by drury , aharonian & vlk ( 1993 ) .",
    "an important point of the papers of both reynolds ( 1996 ) and mastichiadis ( 1996 ) is that electrons should be accelerated up to 100 tev energies .",
    "mastichiadis also suggests that the observation of tev gamma rays from supernova remnants would not , in itself , provide direct evidence of acceleration of nuclei at supernova shocks .",
    "pohl ( 1996 ) has also recently suggested tev gamma - rays from supernova remnants may be of leptonic origin .    in the present paper we consider gamma - ray production by interactions of accelerated nuclei and electrons in ic  443 and @xmath0  cygni .",
    "our approach is to analyze the observed @xmath0ray fluxes and attempt to extract the source parameters from the data rather than use theoretical models of particle acceleration in supernova remnants .",
    "we assume power law spectra for electrons and protons , possibly different in slope and in maximum momentum on acceleration . we perform a maximum likelihood fit to the gamma ray spectra of ic  443 and @xmath0  cygni to determine the ratio of electrons to protons , the power - law spectral index , and the average matter density seen by the accelerated particles .",
    "before describing our detailed calculation , we first briefly discuss the general features of the expected @xmath1 , bremsstrahlung and inverse compton gamma ray spectra , and make order of magnitude estimates of their relative contributions to the gamma ray flux .",
    "the momentum spectrum of particles accelerated by first order fermi acceleration at a strong shock is expected to be @xmath3 .",
    "protons accelerated with this spectrum , and interacting within the remnant , will produce at high energies a @xmath1 gamma ray number spectrum having approximately the same slope , @xmath4 , but with a low - energy turnover at @xmath5 . at high energy , electrons will cool by inverse compton and synchrotron losses , @xmath6 ( neglecting , for the moment , scattering in the klein - nishina regime ) . in an equilibrium situation ,",
    "the ambient spectrum of electrons will be steepened by one power to @xmath7 , giving rise to a spectrum of inverse compton gamma rays proportional to @xmath4 . however , as we shall show below , _ a priori _ it is not obvious that that such an equilibrium exists for the supernova remnants in question .",
    "the cooling time for electrons in a magnetic field is @xmath8 so , for typical interstellar magnetic fields ( @xmath9 g ) , one finds a cooling time at 100 tev of @xmath10 years .",
    "this time is longer than , but of the same order of magnitude of the age of the supernova remnants we are considering . because of this , mastichiadis ( 1996 ) assumed that the ambient electron spectrum is not yet affected by radiative losses .",
    "the cooling time for ic scattering on the microwave background is of the same magnitude and so ic losses will have some effect , though possibly minor , on the shape of the electron spectrum .",
    "hence , as a starting point we estimate the @xmath0ray luminosities assuming that protons and electrons are accelerated with identical power law momentum spectra extending to the same maximum momentum @xmath11 , and that these spectra have not significantly evolved .",
    "the bremsstrahlung spectrum will have the same power - law as the electron spectrum , extending to low energy so that bremsstrahlung photons eventually dominate below the @xmath1 peak even for very small @xmath12 ratios . on the other hand ,",
    "the inverse compton spectrum from an @xmath13 electron spectrum will be @xmath14 , which is much flatter than the @xmath1 and bremsstrahlung gamma ray spectra .",
    "we next discuss the relative importance of the various processes to the gamma ray flux based on order of magnitude estimates .",
    "the crude approximations discussed below are only used for these order of magnitude estimates , and we use exact formulae for the results we shall present later .",
    "furthermore , in section 5 we shall make detailed fits to the gamma ray spectra which allow for the possibility of the ambient electron spectrum being steeper than the proton spectrum , either due to a different spectrum at acceleration or due to evolution of the electron spectrum .",
    "for this estimate we approximate the total proton spectrum ( integrated over the snr ) by @xmath15 protons  gev@xmath16 . for @xmath17 , the gamma - ray luminosity from @xmath1 production is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the inelastic proton ",
    "proton cross section , @xmath20 is the average matter density sampled by the protons and @xmath21 is a spectrum - weighted moment of the momentum distribution of pions produced in proton - proton collisions ( @xcite ) . for @xmath22  2.0 , 2.3 , and 2.4",
    "respectively , @xmath23 0.16 , 0.075 and 0.066 .",
    "thus , for @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is in gev and @xmath27 is in @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , we approximate the total electron spectrum by @xmath29 electrons gev@xmath16 . to obtain the bremsstrahlung luminosity , we assume that after an electron of energy @xmath30 has traveled one radiation length , @xmath31 , it is converted into a photon of energy @xmath32 .",
    "hence , @xmath33 thus , for @xmath24 , @xmath34    for inverse compton scattering , we approximate the photon energy after scattering by an electron of energy @xmath35 by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean photon energy of the radiation field under consideration . provided the compton scattering is in the thomson regime ( @xmath38 ) this gives an inverse compton luminosity @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and we obtain @xmath41 for scattering off the microwave background , we use @xmath42 @xmath28 , @xmath43 ev , and obtain @xmath44 where @xmath26 is in gev .",
    "we note that , for an assumed matter density of 1 @xmath28 , at 1 gev the inverse compton scattering contribution is an order of magnitude larger than the bremsstrahlung contribution , and the relative importance of the inverse compton scattering contribution increases with energy . in the next two sections we describe the radiation and matter environments of the two snr , and our accurate treatment of pion production , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton scattering .",
    "in addition to the microwave background radiation , and the galactic infrared / optical background radiation , the radiation produced locally within the snr will provide target photons for inverse compton scattering . the two snr we consider are at galactocentric radii sufficiently close to that of the sun that we may use the local infrared / optical radiation field for the galactic background . we adopt the spectrum of mathis et al .",
    "( 1983 ) which is the sum of 6 diluted blackbody spectra and is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the mean photon energy for this spectrum is @xmath45 ev , and the total photon number density is @xmath46 @xmath28 , giving an energy density of @xmath47 ev @xmath28 .",
    "using equation  [ eq : approxic ] we can estimate the gamma ray luminosity applicable to the thomson regime @xmath48 this is only a factor @xmath49 lower than that for scattering off the microwave background , and so it is necessary to include this radiation field in an accurate calculation .",
    "lozinskaya ( 1991 ) gives an excellent discussion of the supernova remnants ic  443 and @xmath0  cygni .",
    "we consider first the remnant ic  443 which is at a distance of @xmath50 kpc , and has an angular diameter of @xmath51 giving a radius of @xmath52 pc .",
    "the remnant is probably about 5000 years old and is expanding into a very inhomogeneous medium including dense molecular clouds .",
    "most of the remnant has a temperature of @xmath53 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent measurements by asaoka and aschenbach ( 1994 ) of the x  ray spectrum indicate two components : @xmath54 m@xmath55 at 1 kev , and @xmath56 m@xmath55 at 13 kev . identifying the swept - up mass with @xmath57 m@xmath55 leads to a pre - snr interstellar density of @xmath58 @xmath28 .",
    "petre et al . (",
    "1988 ) measured the x  ray flux in the 210 kev range , @xmath59 erg @xmath60 s@xmath16 , and a temperature of 1.03 kev .",
    "approximating the spectrum by a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum , we obtain a total x  ray energy flux of @xmath61 ev @xmath60 s@xmath16 .",
    "dividing by the solid angle subtended by the snr , and multiplying by @xmath62 we get an approximation to the x  ray energy density in the remnant of @xmath63 ev @xmath28 . for a mean photon energy of @xmath64 kev , one obtains a photon number density of @xmath65 @xmath28 . using equation  [ eq : approxic ] we can estimate the gamma ray luminosity applicable to the thomson regime ( in this case for @xmath66 gev ) @xmath67 at higher energies ( where scattering is in the klein - nishina regime ) the gamma ray luminosity will be much lower . comparing the flux from inverse compton scattering on the x  ray emission with that from inverse compton scattering on the microwave background , we find it to be negligible in ic  443 .",
    "however , in younger supernova remnants the x  ray emission may present a significant target for ic scattering .",
    "the supernova remnant associated with @xmath0  cygni , g78.2 + 2.1 , is at a distance of @xmath68 kpc , and has an angular size of @xmath69 giving a radius of @xmath70 pc .",
    "the remnant is probably about 7000 years old and is also expanding into a very inhomogeneous medium including dense molecular clouds .",
    "a dense cloud occupies @xmath71% of the volume of the remnant and this has been used by pollock ( 1985 ) to predict the gamma ray flux ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we shall return to a discussion of the effects of an inhomogeneous interstellar medium later when we discuss the electron to proton ratio .",
    "the x  ray flux obtained by higgs , landecker , & seward ( 1983 ) in the 0.24 kev range is about @xmath72 erg @xmath60 s@xmath16 , with a temperature of 1.3 kev and ambient gas density of @xmath73 @xmath28 .",
    "the x - ray intensity is of the same order of magnitude as from ic 443 , and so we conclude that inverse compton scattering on the x ",
    "rays in @xmath0  cygni , and other old snr , will not make an important contribution to the gamma ray flux .",
    "a major component of the radiation field of snr is the infrared emission due to shock heated dust .",
    "for both sources , saken , fesen , & shull ( 1992 ) provide infrared spectra obtained with the iras satellite .",
    "we use their two - temperature model fits to represent the radiation field in the infrared .",
    "we have used the solid angle subtended by each source to obtain the energy density from the intensity . in ic  443",
    "the mean photon energies , number densities , and energy densities of the two diluted blackbody components are : @xmath74 , 0.04 ev ; @xmath75 , 11.8 @xmath28 ; @xmath76 , 0.51 ev @xmath28 . in @xmath0",
    "cygni the mean photon energies , number densities , and energy densities of the two diluted blackbody components are : @xmath77 , 0.025 ev ; @xmath78 , 6.2 @xmath28 ; @xmath79 , 0.15 ev @xmath28 . in both cases",
    "the infrared photon densities exceed the diffuse galactic infrared photon densities , and so inverse compton scattering of locally produced infrared photons could make a substantial contribution to the total inverse compton flux .",
    "the total radiation field we adopt is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) for ic  443 and in fig .",
    "2(b ) for @xmath0  cygni , and in each case we show the contributions of the diffuse background and the locally produced radiation . the iras data ( @xcite ) are also shown .",
    "for interactions with matter we assume standard interstellar composition . for proton interactions we use the event generator target ( gaisser , protheroe & stanev 1983 ) in its proton target version .",
    "target , which has been extensively tested in numerous applications , represents correctly the proton interaction cross sections and the secondary particles spectra starting at the pion production production threshold . at energies above 100 gev the interaction cross section has a @xmath80 behavior for proton  proton interactions . at total proton energy below 2.5",
    "gev target generates only @xmath81 resonances .",
    "the output of this part of the code was compared with the results of dermer ( 1986 ) and is in good agreement .    in the case of bremsstrahlung ,",
    "yields are calculated for fully ionized matter for which the cross  section is strongly energy dependent .",
    "we use the expressions of koch & motz ( 1959 ) with form factors for hydrogen and helium adjusted to represent the more precise values of tsai ( 1974 ) .",
    "the cross - sections for fully ionized matter are calculated with the bremsstrahlung formulae valid in the absence of screening by the atomic electrons .",
    "these cross sections are given by protheroe , stanev , & berezinsky ( 1995 ) .",
    "for inverse compton scattering we use the klein - nishina cross section ( @xcite ) to calculate the mean free path and the distribution of photon energies produced in the ic process .",
    "we perform an exact monte carlo simulation of interactions as described by protheroe , mastichiadis & dermer ( 1992 ) to build up distributions of secondary electrons and photons arising from interactions of electrons of a given energy with blackbody radiation of given temperature .",
    "these distributions are then convoluted with the parent electron spectrum .",
    "we assume the momentum spectrum of accelerated particles is of the form @xmath82 so that the energy spectrum is @xmath83 where @xmath84 . we allow for different normalizations and spectral indices of protons ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) and electrons ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) , and define the electron to proton ratio as @xmath89 which is the ratio of the differential momentum spectra at 1  gev / c . at high energies ( @xmath90 )",
    "the energy spectrum of protons is just @xmath91 gev@xmath16 , which gives the total number of protons per unit energy at the supernova remnant .",
    "similarly , for electrons at high energies ( @xmath92 ) the energy spectrum is @xmath93 gev@xmath16 .",
    "we calculate gamma ray emissivities for @xmath1 production , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton scattering in the radiation fields appropriate to each snr for the case where @xmath94 gev@xmath16 @xmath28 ( @xmath95 is the volume of the region where the accelerated particles are located ) , @xmath96 , and a nucleon density of @xmath97 @xmath28 . the emissivities are calculated for each process for a range of @xmath98 for the case where @xmath99 , assuming @xmath97 @xmath28 , @xmath100 , and a radiation field analogous to fig .",

    "the emissivity , @xmath101 ( @xmath28 s@xmath16 gev@xmath16 ) , multiplied by @xmath102 , is shown in fig .  3 for @xmath103 .",
    "with the exception of the local infrared radiation field ( short dashes in fig .",
    "3 ) , and neglecting the small differences of the galactic infrared background as a function of the galactocentric distance , this emissivity spectrum is universal for snr in the galaxy ( with suitable scaling of @xmath1 and bremsstrahlung emissivity with matter density ) on the assumption that supernova remnants accelerate charged particles with a @xmath104 spectrum , and that radiative losses have not yet affected the electron spectrum .",
    "the main feature of the emissivity spectrum is the dominance of the inverse compton scattering ( as already expected from eq .",
    "[ eq : approxic ] ) with its very flat spectrum .",
    "it is instructive to follow the scaling of the emissivities of different processes with the supernova remnant parameters .",
    "the relative contribution of ic scales up or down only with the electron to proton ratio . in the vicinity of @xmath26 = 1 gev",
    "the electron to proton ratio has to be of order of 0.01 for the ic scattering on the microwave background not to exceed the @xmath1 contribution for a matter density of 1 nucleon @xmath28 and @xmath98 = 2 .",
    "as long as ic is the most important contribution , the gamma - ray spectrum will be harder than the parent electron spectrum .",
    "the @xmath1 contribution scales only with the matter density .",
    "alternatively , if the matter density is very high , @xmath105 nucleons @xmath28 one can suppress the ic contribution relative to the bremsstrahlung and @xmath1 contributions .",
    "for such high densities , more than two orders of magnitude higher than the average densities expected from the mass of the ejecta ( @xcite ) , the contribution of bremsstrahlung , which is proportional both to matter density and to the electron to proton ratio , would dominate . for a @xmath1 ` bump ' to be visible",
    "requires an electron to proton ratio less than 1 .",
    "we define @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 to be the gamma ray emissivities ( @xmath28 s@xmath16 gev@xmath16 ) for pion production , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton scattering calculated for @xmath109 gev@xmath16 @xmath28 , @xmath100 , and @xmath97 @xmath28 .",

    "for each snr , the @xmath0rays are binned in 10 energy bins , two of which give upper limits , and so the total number of data points is not sufficiently large to fit all possible parameters simultaneously .",
    "instead we perform four different fits corresponding to the following assumptions .",
    "both protons and electrons are accelerated with power - law spectra with the same index @xmath98 and to the same maximum energy of 80 tev .",
    "the choice of @xmath115=80 tev is arbitrary but sufficiently high for fitting the egret @xmath0ray spectra which only extend to @xmath11910 gev and for extrapolating to the whipple limits of several hundred gev .",
    "the assumption of a pure power law is an approximation .",
    "non - linear effects in cosmic - ray modified shocks generally lead to some concavity in the spectra ( @xcite ) , though the deviation from a power - law is slight for relativistic particles .",
    "for example , the proton spectrum calculated by ellison ( 1993 ) steepens by less than 2 per cent in the spectral index below 1 tev from its flattest high energy value .",
    "fit  2 . protons and electrons are accelerated with the same spectral index @xmath98 but the electron spectrum cuts off at an energy @xmath120 which is a fit parameter .",
    "@xmath121 = 80 tev .",

    "fit  4 . protons and electrons",
    "are accelerated to identical power law spectra and both cut off at the same maximum energy @xmath122 .",
    "the fitting procedure actually consisted of a tabulation of the maximum likelihood value @xmath123 for a pre  determined set of parameter values . except for the spectral indices @xmath98 which were taken on a 0.05 grid , all other parameters were introduced on logarithmic scales of 10@xmath124 , i.e. ten parameter values per decade .",
    "this grid for the trial parameters is small enough to produce neighboring spectra well within the uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "the parameter set with a maximum @xmath123 value was taken to be the best fit .",

    "the fit gives @xmath98 = 2.32@xmath125 .",
    "the errors are calculated from the values of @xmath98 at which @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the best fit value of the likelihood function @xmath123 , and @xmath128 is the number of standard deviations ( @xmath129 to give @xmath130 errors ) .",

    "the electron to proton ratio corresponding to this value of @xmath98 is @xmath132 .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath117 is @xmath133 , with very large error bars because the emission is dominated by @xmath1 production and bremsstrahlung .",
    "thus , we can not reliably give the matter density since the fit requires a very high density only to make the ic component negligible .",
    "this also prevents us from obtaining a reliable estimate of the cosmic ray density at the source .",
    "5 shows a similar fit for @xmath0  cygni .",
    "the best @xmath98 value is @xmath134 , which gives an electron to proton ratio of @xmath135 , and a similar value of @xmath117 to ic  443 .",
    "the overall normalization gives @xmath136 cm gev@xmath16 .",
    "the vhe limits are from whipple ( @xcite ) and from hegra ( @xcite ) and are again consistent with the fit .",
    "we can get some useful information from the overall normalization constant @xmath137 which , given that we know @xmath110 , gives us the product of @xmath27 , @xmath138  gev / c@xmath139 , and @xmath95 .",
    "the total energy content of a spectrum of the form of equation  [ eq : spectrum ] with @xmath140 and @xmath141 is @xmath142  gev .",
    "thus for ic  443 at a distance of 1.5  kpc the normalization @xmath143 cm gev@xmath16 requires a total energy in accelerated protons of @xmath144 where @xmath27 is the number density of gas in the region where the accelerated particles are located .",
    "the corresponding value for @xmath0  cygni is a factor of 3 higher .",
    "alternatively , we can obtain an estimate of the total mass in the region where the accelerated particles are located as a function of the energy density in accelerated particles @xmath145 for ic  443 and a factor 3 higher for @xmath0  cygni .",
    "fit  1 requires a very high matter density in order to suppress the ic contribution to the @xmath0ray flux which is much flatter than the observed spectrum .",
    "the snr g78.2 + 2.1 associated with @xmath0  cygni was tentatively identified with the cos - b source 2cg78 + 01 ( @xcite ) . a cloud of density @xmath146 @xmath28 occupies @xmath71% of the volume of the remnant , and this density has been used by pollock ( 1985 ) in predicting gev gamma ray fluxes .",
    "aharonian , drury , & vlk ( 1994 ) also discussed this association and point out that the emission may extend to tev energies . at radio frequencies ,",
    "most of the emission comes from the se part of the remnant ( @xcite ) , and this appears to coincide also with a region of exceptionally high 90 @xmath147 m intensity , and a molecular cloud near the rim of the remnant , implying that this region may be the source of the gamma ray emission .",
    "a density of @xmath146 @xmath28 is comparable with the densities that come from the maximum likelihood fits .",
    "however , the fitted density is the density averaged over the region where the accelerated particles are located , and so this value may be unrealistically high unless acceleration is taking place only close to such a massive high - density cloud .",
    "this might occur at massive clouds interacting with the snr shock .",
    "another way to look at the numbers for @xmath0  cygni is to note that the energy in cosmic rays required in a region with density @xmath148  @xmath28 is @xmath149  erg .",
    "if this high density occupies 5% of the volume of the snr then the total energy in cosmic rays , assuming them to be uniformly distributed , is @xmath150  erg , approximately 10% of the initial kinetic energy of the ejecta of a typical supernova .    finally , we check that for the fitted electron spectra the synchrotron x  ray flux predicted for reasonable magnetic fields does not exceed that observed .",
    "this is particularly important for the case of fit  1 where the electron spectrum extends up to 80 tev and one would expect to generate a significant x  ray flux for any standard value of magnetic field at the shock .",
    "taking the electron spectrum in the source to be @xmath151 where @xmath152 is in gev , we may obtain the synchrotron x  ray flux at earth ( erg @xmath60 ) in the energy range @xmath153 to @xmath154 @xmath155 here @xmath156 is the power per unit frequency ( erg hz@xmath16 ) emitted at frequency @xmath157 by an electron of energy @xmath152 ( gev ) in a magnetic field with perpendicular component @xmath158 ( gauss ) and is given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 where @xmath165 is a bessel function of the second kind ( @xcite ) .",

    "similarly for @xmath0  cygni we predict a 0.24  kev flux of @xmath171 erg @xmath60 s@xmath16 which is not in conflict with the observed flux of @xmath72 erg @xmath60 s@xmath16 .      as noted above , the x - ray luminosity calculated using a magnetic field of 6 @xmath147 g and the electron spectra from fit  1 is not in direct contradiction with the observed luminosities of either object . however , for higher magnetic fields , e.g. due to shock compression , the predicted luminosity would exceed that observed if @xmath158 is higher than @xmath172 g ( ic  443 ) or @xmath173 g ( @xmath0  cygni ) . even for fields below these limits , there may be a problem due to the power - law nature of the synchrotron spectrum given that the observed x  ray spectrum appears to be consistent with thermal bremsstrahlung origin .",

    "it is important to notice that the contribution of the individual processes is now different .",
    "the role of bremsstrahlung is negligible .",
    "the @xmath0ray fluxes above 1 gev are due to @xmath1 production while ic dominates at lower energy .",
    "the power law spectra preferred by the fits are very flat ( @xmath2242 ) , @xmath2250.1 , and the matter density is less than 0.1 . both electron and proton spectra cut off at less than 60 gev .",
    "with the current set of assumptions the fits of the @xmath0ray spectra of the two supernova remnants identified three possible sets of basic parameters .",
    "the first set , represented by fit  1 , consists of a relatively steep acceleration spectra and requires very large matter density in the acceleration region .",
    "the second set , fits  2 & 3 allows for more reasonable matter densities at the @xmath0ray production region .",
    "fit 4 , which assumes a cutoff of the electron and proton spectra at the same maximum energy , results in a low matter density but also a very low value of the maximum energy .",
    "a fit with @xmath226 allowed to increase while keeping @xmath227 low would give a similar fit to the egret data , but steepening the electron spectrum through synchrotron radiation at such a low energy would require extreme magnetic fields .",
    "note that recent theoretical calculations , accounting for nonlinear effects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , predict compression ratios higher than 4 that could lead to mean slopes at acceleration much flatter than the canonical @xmath98 = 2 value .",
    "flat electron spectra at low energies would also be more consistent with the radio spectral indices of the two supernova remnants which imply electron spectral indices at low energies of @xmath228 for ic443 , and @xmath229 for @xmath0  cyg ( @xcite ) .",
    "fits 1 to 3 ( ic  443 ) and fits 1 and 3 ( @xmath0  cygni ) appear to be inconsistent with the radio data .",
    "however , if a high magnetic field were present ( i.e. close to @xmath177 ) then the energies of the electrons producing the radio synchrotron emission could be much lower than the energies of the @xmath0-ray emitting electrons , thereby removing the inconsistency .",
    "this would occur , for example in the case of fit  2 , where the synchrotron emitting electrons could have energies as low as 5  mev ( ic  443 ) .",
    "the improvement of fit quality , shown in tables 1 and 2 , increases as expected when an additional fit parameter is introduced .",
    "we have not employed the @xmath230test , which measures the fit improvement with the increase of number of parameters , because our different fits do not correspond to particular models of supernova remnants that we are testing .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath174 value is to a large extent determined by the end points of the data set where the efficiency and the statistical accuracy of the egret measurements are the worst .    following the egret observation of ic  443 and @xmath0  cygni it was anticipated , based on an @xmath13 extrapolation of the observed flux , that these sources should be observable in the tev range and above with ground based detectors .",
    "a simple @xmath13 extrapolation of the egret data is inconsistent with upper limits from casa ( @xcite ) and cygnus ( @xcite ) around 100 tev , from hegra above 20 tev and from whipple above 300 gev . in this context , it is interesting to note that , except for fit 4 , which has very low @xmath231 , our fits to the egret data alone seem to indicate steeper source spectra .",
    "the upper limits of the whipple observatory on the tev emission from the sources is shown on all emission spectra shown in figs .",
    "it is important to notice that the fitted spectra are always below , or very close to , the experimental upper limits . in the case of",
    "fit  1 of ic  443 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , for example , the fitted spectrum is @xmath11950% higher than the upper limit .",
    "half of that difference is due to the contribution of bremsstrahlung .",
    "note however , that if the interactions are taking place with neutral matter , such as that in a molecular cloud , then the cross sections we have used for bremsstrahlung in ionized matter would be inappropriate , and the bremsstrahlung spectral index could be steepened by as much as @xmath232 which would have the effect of bringing the fitted spectrum below the experimental limit .",
    "an electron source spectrum with @xmath233 is favored by a comparison of recent cosmic ray electron propagation calculations with direct cosmic ray electron observations above @xmath52 gev ( @xcite )",
    ". however , source spectra as flat as @xmath13 are possible ( @xcite ) if the distance to the nearest source is @xmath105 pc or more .",
    "the spectra of the two snr observed by egret show no sign of flattening at , or below , 100 mev , indicating the presence of a steep spectral component due to bremsstrahlung .",
    "there are many different implications of a steep spectrum on acceleration ( @xmath234 ) , extracted with some of the assumptions of our analysis ( fits  13 ) .",
    "for example , such a source spectrum for cosmic ray nuclei would require a loss rate in the galaxy , and hence a diffusion coefficient for cosmic ray propagation , proportional to @xmath235 rather than @xmath236 which is usually assumed based on cosmic ray secondary to primary ratios ( note that a kolmogorov spectrum actually predicts a diffusion coefficient proportional to @xmath237 , see also ptuskin et al .",
    "1993 , and biermann 1995 ) .",
    "such a diffusion coefficient is also favored by reacceleration models ( @xcite ) .",
    "such spectra , however , would not be consistent with the radio observations and would require a strong spectral steepening above radio emitting energies .    in conclusion",
    ", we have modeled the gamma ray emission of ic  443 and @xmath0  cygni including inverse compton scattering on all relevant radiation fields , bremsstrahlung , and pion production .",
    "we fit the modeled production spectra to the egret data assuming a power - law momentum spectrum of electrons and nuclei in the snr and exponential cutoffs .",
    "the results from the fitting show that ( a ) the dominant contributions come from bremsstrahlung and @xmath1 decay provided the spectra of both electrons and nuclei extend above 60 gev .",
    "the ic contribution can only be important with fine tuning , when @xmath115 for both electrons and nucleons is @xmath11940 gev ; ( b ) an electron to proton ratio of @xmath119 0.050.5 is required under all four assumptions that we have explored ; ( c ) a spectral index of @xmath2382.4 is required if electrons and nuclei are accelerated with the same spectral indices unless the acceleration spectra cut off below 60 gev ; ( d ) if the acceleration spectra of electrons and nuclei are not the same the data requires electron spectra that are significantly steeper than the nuclei spectra , which contribute to the experimentally observed range only the @xmath1 feature , which depends mildly on the acceleration spectra of nuclei ; ( e ) a very high , but uncertain , average matter density is required if the electron spectrum has the same spectral index as the proton spectrum and the cut - off energy is very high , e.g. 80 tev ( note , however , that matter densities as high as @xmath146 @xmath28 are present in molecular clouds associated with these snr ) .",
    "we also note that in this case the bremsstrahlung contribution at 1 gev is @xmath239 , somewhat higher than the @xmath2 obtained from a fit to the diffuse galactic gamma ray intensity ( @xcite ) , which is probably lower due to the effects of cosmic ray energy losses during propagation which are different for electrons and nuclei .    at the present time and with the current available experimental information",
    "we can not make a choice between the two basic assumptions that we used for fitting the egret data .",
    "additional experimental information is necessary for further analysis .",
    "one crucial data set would consist of tev detections ( or lower upper limits ) of these two and other supernova remnants .",
    "a possible observation would allow us the exclude the assumption for a low energy cutoff of the acceleration spectra and to obtain better determined values for the shape of the electron and proton spectra and for the matter density at the source .",
    "we also plan to extend our analysis by using theoretically motivated shapes for the spectra of the accelerated particles .",
    "it will then be possible to also predict the expected 100 tev @xmath0ray fluxes from supernova remnants in some current models ( @xcite ) , which extend the accelerated particles spectra to z@xmath240400 tev",
