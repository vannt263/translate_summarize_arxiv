    "quantum spin liquid has been a highly sought - after intriguing quantum state of matter for decades , ever since its first conception as a possible new type of insulating ground state by phil anderson in 1973 in his study of antiferromagnet in triangular lattice @xcite.the discovery of high @xmath0 superconductivity in cuprates prompted another impetus for interest in this state of matter due to the proposal that this state might arise in the physics of this strongly correlated superconducting material @xcite.the search for spin liquid expanded to magnetic materials especially on frustrated spin systems where geometry and spin exchange interaction collaborate to give rise to ground state degeneracy and quantum fluctuations that tend to disorder the ground state @xcite.the search for spin liquid state is still very intensive to these days in both theoretical and experimental fronts @xcite .",
    "frustrated spin systems have provided promising candidates to host quantum spin liquid state.we will focus on one of such frustrated spin systems in this work , namely kagom antiferromagnet , where the spins live on lattice with corner - sharing triangles as shown in fig.1.candidate materials with kagom lattice structure have been discovered in the past few years that open the opportunity to explore the existence of quantum spin liquid state in those materials @xcite.the presence of triangles and antiferromagnetic spin exchange interaction make this system highly frustrated.the ground state of kagom has been the subject of intense studies for several decades.some works proposed that the ground states are ordered @xcite@xcite@xcite while some others , especially those from recent years , proposed that the strong frustration may actually permit quantum disordered ground state ; the quantum spin liquid.the precise of nature of such quantum spin liquid state has also been an intense debate with significant numerical works in the past a decade suggested spin liquid state that takes the form of u(1 ) dirac spin liquid @xcite@xcite , gapped @xmath1 spin liquid with topological order @xcite@xcite , and chiral spin liquid @xcite.we will be concerned especially on chiral spin liquid in this work , motivated by the observation that such state would manifest a spin analog of fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , the theoretical explanation of which @xcite has contributed to the birth of the research on topological phases of matter.chiral spin liquid is a type of quantum spin liquid that breaks some type of discrete symmetry associated with chirality , as defined by the scalar spin chirality @xmath2 for any three spins on a triangular plaquette of the lattice in which spins live @xcite.chiral spin liquid can be characterized by long range order of such chirality but in the absence of long range spin order.other characterization involves laughlin type of wave function motivated by the analogy between chiral spin liquid physics and the physics of fractional quantum hall effect @xcite@xcite.there have been extensive theoretical and numerical studies on this form of spin liquid over decades on simple model as well as truly frustrated spin systems up to recently , especially on the popular candidate system believed to host quantum spin liquid state ; the kagom antiferromagnet , with isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin exchange interaction @xcite , anisotropic version @xcite@xcite , as well as the one that also includes explicit scalar spin chirality term @xcite@xcite , but a full conceptual understanding is yet to be achieved and the very existence and characterization of the properties of this chiral spin state are to be clarified both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "we present in this work a low - energy effective theoretical point of view on chiral spin liquid ground state implemented directly to kagom antiferromagnet with isotropic heisenberg spin exchange interactions.the crucial insight provided by an effective theory is that chiral spin liquid arises from chiral symmetry breaking effect described by an action involving chern - simons term , which breaks discrete symmetries in the form of time - reversal and parity symmetries @xcite@xcite.an _ induced _ chern - simons term in 2d antiferromagnet has been proposed recently @xcite in a slightly different context of doped spin system , but an explicit demonstration of _ spontaneous _ emergence of such topological term beyond symmetry argument in the context of chiral spin liquid in pure spin systems is a challenging task.an attempt to formulate a low energy effective theory of chiral spin liquid has been made for an anisotropic version of kagom antiferromagnet and one that includes explicit scalar spin chirality within schwinger boson quantum formalism @xcite.we provide in this work a simpler and yet transparent formulation of field theory of chiral spin liquid on isotropic kagom heisenberg antiferromagnet with no explicit scalar spin chirality and show how chern - simons term can naturally emerge in this system spontaneously .",
    "we consider isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian defined on kagom lattice with first , second , and third neighbor spin exchange interactions , @xmath3 @xmath4 with first ( @xmath5 ) , second ( @xmath6 ) , and third ( @xmath7 ) neighbor spin exchange interactions with couplings @xmath8 respectively.in the rest of the paper , we use the phrase ` kagom antiferromagnet ' to represent our choice that the first neighbor spin exchange coupling is antiferromagnetic @xmath9.in @xcite , numerical calculation based on schwinger boson mapping of @xmath10 heisenberg model with @xmath11 and ferromagnetic ( @xmath12 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath13 ) further neighbor spin exchanges suggested the occurrence of gapped chiral topological spin liquid , which put forward alternative scenario deduced from earlier numerical works which found gapped @xmath14 spin liquid in this system @xcite@xcite.this very motivating result of @xcite was further corroborated by other numerical studies also found chiral spin liquid in kagom antiferomagnet @xcite@xcite.the wavefunction overlap of the chiral spin liquid ground state with projected gutzwiller wave function was analyzed and nice overlap was found @xcite.notably , it was argued in @xcite in conjunction with @xcite and @xcite that the chiral spin liquid occurs only between the nonplanar ordered state with 12 sublattices called ` cuboc1 ' @xcite and the planar ordered state called @xmath15 first proposed in @xcite.one of the goals of this work is to provide a universal field theoretical explanation for this numerical conclusion.we accomplish this by considering low - energy effective theory of the spin system around the ordered phases that dominate the ground state of kagom heisenberg model .",

    "we will take , as a starting point in this theoretical work , the numerical observations that the ground state of kagom antiferromagnet is dominated by magnetically ordered states @xcite@xcite.since we have ordered states , we can use semiclassical treatment of spin system and derive a low - energy effective hamiltonian around those ordered states @xcite.such low energy effective theory describes the dynamics of the quantum fluctuations around the ordered state spin configuration corresponding to goldstone modes.then , one can define an appropriate gauge field that defines the effective gauge degree of freedom to represent the quantum fluctuations around the ordered ground state , which is thus one step forward beyond mean - field description.this gives rise to an emergent gauge theory which can be analyzed via elegant duality transformation in terms of dual theory @xcite .",
    "numerical works based on schwinger boson mean field theory @xcite found a ground state phase diagram with cuboc1 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ordered states.we will analyze these ordered ground states within our low - energy effective theory picture.the @xmath17 and @xmath16 states are coplanar ordered states with @xmath18 spin structure where the three spins on each triangle of the kagom lattice form a mercedes star and effective flux from curling chirality with respectively alternating sense ( clockwise vs. anticlockwise ) and non - alternating clockwise sense on each two adjacent triangles around the david star @xcite.the cuboc1 state on the other hand is a non - coplanar ordered state with out - of - plane spin vectors within 12 sublattices per unit cell , with the twelves spins point toward the 12 corners of a cubochedron.within semiclassical approach , the spin is represented as classical vector @xmath19 from which the heisenberg hamiltonian eq.([heisenbergafmkagome ] ) becomes    @xmath20\\ ] ] @xmath21\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 and working to first order in the gradients of the angular fields , we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is imaginary time as we are working in euclidean space-time.the next step is to determine an appropriate definition of gauge field in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath27.we define the gauge field as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is local unit vector giving the direction of magnetization @xmath31 and @xmath32 is monopole vector potential in appropriate gauge @xcite.we find that , the resulting vector potential is @xmath33 in the continuum limit and corresponds to a gauge choice where the monopole vector potential is written as @xmath34 while gauge transformation simply adds the above @xmath35 by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is arbitrary integer , which does change the effective magnetic field.for planar ordered states such as the @xmath16 and @xmath17 state where @xmath38 and so we have simple expression @xmath39 , in agreement with that in @xcite.we also see that the vector potential ; the effective gauge field , is independent of @xmath26.this is remarkable observation and suggests that since we are considering 2d system , even though the spin vector lives in so(3 ) space , only the 2d projection of the spin vector dynamics would define the effective gauge field , which should indeed live in the 2d space on which the spin system lives.the @xmath40-dependent terms in fact define the kinetic momentum operator corresponding to massive mode which will be integrated out when we are interested in the low energy effective gauge field hamiltonian@xcite to be derived in this section.doing this integration out of the @xmath40 , we arrive at the following hamiltonian from eq.([hamiltonianfluctuation ] )    @xmath41\\ ] ] @xmath42\\ ] ]    where we have defined @xmath43 and from eq.([hamiltonianfluctuation ] ) , we have @xmath44 which gives the ground state energy @xmath45 determining the energetics of the ordered state.this ground state energy has been computed in @xcite and is consistent with what one will get from the above eq.([gsenergy]).the appearance of explicit mass term for the gauge field in eq.([lowenergyhamiltonian ] ) represents a dynamical mass generation for the gauge field , that is , the anderson - higgs mechanism , which is a well - established concept in quantum field theory @xcite .    for planar spin ordered states , we have @xmath46 for all @xmath47 so that @xmath48\\ ] ] where we have used from eq.([gaugefield ] ) that @xmath39 for planar ordered states.using the observation that for @xmath17 state @xmath49 and for @xmath16 state @xmath50 , we obtain @xmath51 for the @xmath17 state , where we have used the fact that this state only occurs for @xmath52 at the classical level @xcite and @xmath53 for the @xmath16 state , where @xmath54 is the number of sites of kagom lattice with unit cell area @xmath55 and",
    "we have made use of the fact that given unit lattice spacing @xmath56 , we then have @xmath57 and we have chosen the @xmath58 appropriately given by the energy scale determined by the spatial part.an important observation of the result eq.([gaugefieldhamiltonianq=0result ] ) for the @xmath16 , which is a coplanar spin ordered state , the relative weight of the first and further neighbor contributions is of the same order of magnitude.this is related to the fact that for coplanar state , the scalar spin chirality @xmath59 , when the spins are treated as classical vectors , vanishes identically , so that there is no difference between the first and further neighbor spin exchanges .",
    "for the cuboc1 state , we use @xmath60 in conforming with eq.([gaugefield ] ) and symmetrization in going from discrete lattice theory to continuum theory.the geometry of the spin configuration with the 12 sublattice spins is more tedious to work with but the @xmath61 can be determined from the projection of a cuboctahedron on the @xmath62 plane and the @xmath63 plane , from which we obtain    @xmath64 @xmath65    where @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68\\ ] ] @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the coordination numbers of the first , second , and third ( across the diagonal of the hexagon ) neighbor links , respectively.the positiveness of the coefficients @xmath72 is a reassuring justification of the validity of our low energy effective gauge field hamiltonian to describe stable quantum fluctuations around the ordered state configuration .",
    "very surprisingly , we note from eq.([weightcuboc ] ) that the third neighbor s weight factor @xmath73 is of the same order of magnitude as the first neighbor s weight factor @xmath74 but is much larger than that of second neighbor @xmath75.this simply means the quantum fluctuations induced by the third neighbor spin exchange interaction is , contrary to naive expectation , nearly as equally strong as those induced by the first neighbor and even much larger than those induced by the second neighbor.as a comparison , we computed the low - energy gauge field hamiltonian of the @xmath76 kagom antiferromagnet of @xcite and found that the weights of the gauge field quadratic terms are of the same order of magnitude between the first and second neighbor contributions in both the ferromagnet and cuboc states ( note that despite having also 12 sublattices , the cuboc state in the @xmath76 model has different spin configuration than the cuboc1 state in the @xmath77 model @xcite@xcite).more precisely , @xmath78 in ferromagnet state and @xmath79\\approx -0.292893,-(1/\\sqrt{2})\\mathrm{cotan}[\\pi/8]\\approx -1.70711 , \\alpha_{nnn}=1 $ ] for the cuboc state.we thus however note that the weights are opposite in overall sign ; negative in first neighbor and positive in second neighbor in the cuboc state , which means if the first neighbor spin exchange is much larger than that of the second neighbor , we still need a third neighbor to stabilize the theory working in a gaussian theory or else we have to include quartic terms.the result reflected in eqs.([gaugefieldhamiltoniancuboc1result ] ) and ( [ weightcuboc ] ) clearly implies that the third neighbor term in kagom antiferromagnet contributes significantly to inducing quantum fluctuations that will potentially destroy ordered ground state , despite coming from further neighbor interaction.this is the main result of this section .",
