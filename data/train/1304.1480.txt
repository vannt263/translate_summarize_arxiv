    "the coupling of the quantized electromagnetic and electron fields to each other gives rise to radiative corrections in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "one of the quantities altered by these radiative corrections is the electron s magnetic moment , which is particularly interesting because it can be measured to staggeringly high precision @xcite .",
    "the presence of material boundaries affects the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field , thus alters radiative corrections , and thereby causes the magnetic moment for an electron near a surface to differ from its value in free space @xcite .",
    "this could in principle be an important effect to consider since precision @xmath0 factor measurements of leptons not only provide stringent tests of quantum electrodynamics but also potentially open up a low - energy route to testing physics beyond the standard model .",
    "previous literature on this subject has shown that measurement of the shift is not within the reach of contemporary experiments .",
    "however , all these previous investigations have made the crude simplification that the surface may be regarded as perfectly reflecting .",
    "this simplifies calculations , but the perfect - reflector model has obvious physical deficiencies : it does not account for electromagnetic field modes that are evanescent outside the medium , neither does it reproduce the fact that any real medium becomes transparent at high frequencies .",
    "thus , to make a realistic prediction of the potential measurability of this effect , one needs to consider a surface which is imperfectly reflecting and dispersive .",
    "the idea that the use of a more realistic model of the material may significantly affect the shift is not suggested by the results of other electrodynamic boundary - dependent effects .",
    "for example , in the calculation of the casmir - polder force on an atom in front of a surface @xcite , the perfect reflector model is completely adequate for estimates and its results are reproduced in the expected limiting cases , e.g. taking the refractive index of a nondispersive medium to infinity @xcite or the plasma frequency of a plasma surface to infinity @xcite .",
    "the situation is strikingly different for the spin magnetic moment of an electron near a surface where , as we will show , different models for the electromagnetic response of the surface give drastically different results , not necessarily obtainable as limiting cases of each other .",
    "something similar has already been observed for the self - energy shift of a free electron near a nondispersive surface @xcite and has since been investigated also for dispersive dielectric and conducting surfaces @xcite .",
    "the reason for these disagreements between different models has been found to be related to the fact that a free particle admits excitations of arbitrarily low frequency which are dealt with very differently in the various models .",
    "however , the low - frequency part of the photon spectrum turns out to dominate the shift , so that one necessarily gets completely different results for the self - energy in models with different low - frequency electromagnetic response .",
    "by contrast , for bound atomic electrons the gap to the nearest energy level provides a natural low - frequency cutoff for electronic excitations , so that for the casimir - polder shift due to a surface any difference in the low - frequency behaviour of the model of the electromagnetic response of the surface turns out not to matter to leading order .    in order to determine the quantum - field theoretical corrections to the electron s magnetic moment ,",
    "one usually calculates the vertex diagram to the respective order of interest [ cf .",
    "[ fig : feynmandiagrams](a ) to one - loop order ] . the reducible one - loop diagrams [ cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : feynmandiagrams](b)(d ) ] are taken care of through mass and charge renormalization .",
    "thus , in free space the evaluation of the magnetic moment to one - loop order @xmath1 is a straightforward calculation and graduate textbook material ( c.f .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) . however , this changes radically if the electromagnetic field is subject to reflection by a surface",
    ". then even one - loop calculations of quantum electrodynamics get rather complicated @xcite , firstly because of the loss of translation invariance , and secondly because of the localization of the electron that is required if the calculations are to make physical sense and be interpretable .",
    "the photon propagator becomes boundary dependent , so that standard mass and charge renormalization are no longer applicable .",
    "mass renormalization is affected at all orders , and charge renormalization from the two - loop level up , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : extrafeynmandiagrams ] .    most of such technical problems can be avoided by taking a different , more appropriate approach . as we seek only the _ correction _ to the magnetic moment due to the presence of the surface",
    ", it follows that any boundary - independent contributions can be discarded in our calculation .",
    "the bare electron propagator is not affected by the presence of boundary , provided the electron is at least a few compton wavelengths away from the surface of the medium so that the interaction between them is wholly electromagnetic , which is the case we are interested in here .",
    "then the one - loop vacuum polarization diagram can be discarded when coupled to a static external field , and to one - loop order the charge and its renormalization are the same as in free space .",
    "none of the three remaining one - loop diagrams contain any particle - antiparticle loops .",
    "consequently , for the calculation of the _ boundary - dependent _ corrections to the magnetic moment at one - loop level , it suffices to work with a _",
    "first_-quantized electron interacting with a second - quantized photon field .",
    "this allows us to borrow well - tried techniques from quantum optics .",
    "we shall use perturbation theory to determine the energy shift @xmath2 , due to the presence of the material surface , of the electron s spin in a weak external magnetic field @xmath3 , and then extract the magnetic moment as the coefficient @xmath4 of the term linear in @xmath3 .    in the next section ,",

    "however , this approach requires great care in all its steps since several successive orders in the non - relativistic expansion turn out to contribute to the shift .",
    "additionally , in the only comparable previous literature @xcite a second unitary transformation is applied to the transformed hamiltonian ( an approach that the authors term the ` paris method ' ) .",

    "since the inverse of the plasma frequency @xmath182 is the only length scale in the plasma model large and small distance regimes are defined by @xmath279 and @xmath280 , respectively , and hence to speak of large distances is the same as speaking of large @xmath182 .",
    "a dispersive dielectric has features in common with the nondispersive model , e.g.  that modes originating from within the material can be evanescent on the vacuum side . likewise the te reflection coefficient exhibits the same kind of problem with non - commuting limits : the limit of a large dielectric response , which is now described by @xmath281 , is not interchangeable with the static limit @xmath282 .",
    "thus for large @xmath208 we expect the dispersive dielectric to give similar results to the nondispersive dielectric .",

    "the peak moves closer to @xmath293 , and increases in height . to gauge the enhancement that dispersion brings to the shift",
    "we calculate the ratio of the height of the dispersive peak to the nondispersive result at the same @xmath288 , and find @xmath294 a typical value for the frequency @xmath212 in a metal is on the order of a few ev ( see , for example , @xcite ) , meaning that a significant enhancement relative to the nondispersive case would be observed only at extremely small distances @xmath42 .",
    "however , restricting oneself to considering the properties of only elemental solids would be short - sighted .",
    "structures engineered on the nanoscale can have transverse resonance frequencies @xmath212 significantly smaller than any ordinary material  examples include an insb semiconductor grating with @xmath212 ( and @xmath182 ) in the range of a few mev @xcite . these types of materials are at a focal point of strong contemporary interest in low - frequency plasmonics . with appropriate assumptions about the approximation of a part of such a structure as a planar surface , we find that for distances @xmath42 of a few tens of nanometres one may get an enhancement factor on the order of @xmath295 relative to the nondispersive case .",
    "the apparent problem of the behaviour of the nondispersive result in the limit of large refractive index , @xmath255 , can be clarified by comparing it with the behaviour of the dispersive shift at large @xmath288 . in this regime",
    "the shift for the dispersive dielectric model becomes linear in @xmath296 and agrees with the nondispersive results ; so for large @xmath288 the two models are equivalent . the crucial additional observation is to note that for a nondispersive dielectric with large @xmath288 we have @xmath297 , which is to say that a large the refractive index necessarily implies a large static susceptibility .",
    "therefore , in the nondispersive model one can not sensibly make a distinction between an arbitrarily large refractive index and an arbitrarily large static susceptibility .",
    "investigation of the dispersive dielectric has shown that the latter interpretation is the correct one  the magnetic moment shift grows with increasing static susceptibility , but an arbitrarily large static susceptibility is , of course , physically impossible .",
    "so while the shift in the nondispersive case does indeed increase without bound as the refractive index @xmath189 is increased , this is not due any problem with the calculation , but is in fact the result of the static susceptibility growing without bound and an inevitable consequence of the unrealistic exclusion of dispersion from the model .",
    "consideration of the shifts in terms of the static susceptibility also emphasizes the close relationship between plasma and perfect reflector models . in both of these models",
    "the static susceptibility is infinite right from the start , which means that their results do agree in the limit @xmath281 .",
    "the differences between the four models discussed above very clearly show that in order to predict the magnetic moment shift for a given set - up , one must choose a model which is physically appropriate for the low - frequency behaviour of electromagnetic response of the material at hand .",
    "in other words , it matters whether the material is a conductor or an insulator .",
    "these two classes of material are not obtainable as limiting cases of each other because the conductor models ignore the existence of evanescent modes ( which is a direct consequence of their static susceptibilities being infinite ) .",
    "the calculations for each class of model diverge from each other because of non - commutation of a variety of limits of the reflection coefficient , namely between the static limit ( @xmath231 ) and whichever limit we have to take in order to compare models .",
    "for example , we note that the @xmath255 and @xmath231 limits of the nondispersive te reflection coefficient do not commute , which leads to the @xmath255 limit of the result for a nondispersive dielectric to disagree with the perfect reflector result .",
    "a further important example is that the limit of vanishing transverse resonance frequency , @xmath298 , and the static limit @xmath231 of the dispersive te reflection coefficient do not commute , which means that taking @xmath298 ( @xmath299 ) in the dispersive dielectric results will not reproduce the plasma results , while naive comparison of the dielectric functions and suggests that they should .",
    "since this plays such an important roles for the physical interpretation of the results , we summarize the commutation ( or lack thereof ) between the various limits of the reflection coefficients in fig .",
    "[ fig : commutation ] .    for the plasma model , we found a @xmath272 dependence of the magnetic moment shift at small distances , i.e.  small @xmath271 , and that the leading @xmath272 term can be found either by determining the asymptotics of the complete shift , or by considering only the part due to the interaction with just surface plasmons .",
    "the asymptotics of the integrals for the shift in the dispersive dielectric case are too awkward to analyse directly .",
    "instead we give the results one obtains by considering only the interaction with the surface polariton , i.e.  by using eqs .   and in eqs .   and ( [ sponly_para ] ) : @xmath300 @xmath301 surprisingly , for these short - distances @xmath302",
    ", we find that the @xmath298 limits of eqs .   and",
    "_ do _ agree with the corresponding results for the plasma , eqs .   and , unlike the results for general distances",
    "this is because these results depends only on the surface plasmon part of the mode functions and electrostatic interactions , but there is no reflection of travelling photon modes , and hence any non - commutation of limits in the reflection coefficient does not come into play .    at large distances",
    "@xmath304 the shift decreases as @xmath267 , which is obvious when applying watson s lemma to the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ fullresultperp ] ) and ( [ fullresultpara ] ) or , more conveniently , to those in eqs .",

    "( and the discussions following them ) show that the enhancement due to the inclusion of dispersion can be of order @xmath313 under favourable conditions . thus , we have a magnetic moment shift of up to one part in @xmath314 .",
    "the current experimental accuracy for @xmath315 in free space is on the order of one part in @xmath316 @xcite , so that the shift calculated here would compare very favourably to this . as the distance increases to the order of a micron the effect decreases towards the limits of current experimental accuracy .",
    "for example , an electron 0.1@xmath317 m away from the same surface as above would have its magnetic moment shifted by only one part in @xmath318 .",
    "this leads one to ask if the current best techniques for measuring the g factor would be suitable for making a measurement of the surface dependent shift of the magnetic moment .",
    "since one of the sticking points in such experiments is that accurate measurement of the externally applied magnetic field @xmath47 is mostly impossible , g - factor experiments usually do not measure the magnetic moment directly , but instead they find its ratio to either a known magnetic moment , or to the cyclotron frequency of the particle under consideration . in case of the latter for surface - dependent magnetic moments shifts",
    "one would need to take into account the shift in cyclotron frequency of a particle near a surface , which arises due to the position - dependent self - energy of the particle @xcite .",
    "crucially , the leading term of the surface - dependent cyclotron frequency shift is of order @xmath319 and thus much bigger than the magnetic moment shift which is of order @xmath320 ( cf .",
    "( [ relativeshift ] ) ) .",
    "so , an experiment which adapts the techniques used for measuring the free - space g factor to find its surface dependant part would effectively be measuring the change due to the surface in its self - energy , not in its magnetic moment . while direct experimental confirmation of a shift in the self - energy would , of course , be interesting in its own right , its existence represents a significant obstacle to isolation and observation of the magnetic moment shift .",
    "we have shown that the magnetic moment shift near a nondispersive imperfectly reflecting surface has notable differences from the corresponding shift near a perfectly reflecting surface , differing by orders of magnitude and in some cases even in its sign .",
    "the inclusion of dispersion can significantly modify the magnitude of the effect , and that this modification can be tuned by choice of material .",
    "we have given a general formula for the calculation of magnetic moment shifts , into which one can simply insert the relevant dielectric function and evaluate the integrals to obtain the shift as dependent on the distance from the surface and various parameters characterizing the electromagnetic response of the surface .",
    "the work presented here has also considerably extended the horizon of the traditional theory of cavity quantum electrodynamics .",
    "while the effect that causes the shift of the magnetic moment of an electron close to a surface is essentially the same as the one that causes the casimir - polder shift of energy levels in neutral atoms close to a surface , the theory required for the magnetic moment shift is considerably more involved . on the one hand",
    ", this is because the nature of the spin requires a relativistic treatment , but on the other hand , the much more subtle but ultimately more important reason is that dynamics of the system is qualitatively more complicated : a neutral atom interacting with a surface involves the exchange of virtual excitations between just the photon field and the atomic electron , whereas the shift of magnetic moment of an electron near a surface involves virtual excitations being exchanged in a triangle between the photon field , the centre - of - mass motion of the electron , and its spin states .",
    "this is also the reason as to why there is no simple resonance effect when the spin - flip frequency in a magnetic field coincides with an absorption resonance in the material of the surface .",
