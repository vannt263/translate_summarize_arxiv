    "the nuclear many body problem has a well - deserved reputation of being a complex subject .",
    "much of the difficulty has traditionally been attributed to the existence of a strong repulsive core as pointed out by jastrow in 1950 in his analysis of proton - proton scattering ( for a historical overview covering up to 1989 we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption that this repulsive core dominates short - range correlations , preventing two nucleons to approach each other to distances closer than half a fermi , invalidates direct use of mean field methods applied directly to the nn interaction as inferred directly from nn scattering data . from a wilsonian point of view the strength of the interaction , however , depends on the probing wavelength @xmath3 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) which is ultimately related to a high energy cut - off in the problem . in this paper",
    "we will explore the possibility to sidestep much of the computational complexity of the problem . as a first step we want to focus on the description of high momentum components of the nuclear wave function . since the core distance @xmath4 and the fermi momentum @xmath5 at saturation fulfill @xmath6 we will see that by judiciously tuning the corresponding length scale @xmath7 it is possible to access high momentum pair distributions in nuclear matter with back - to - back momentum @xmath8 while keeping scattering information for the same situation in the free space without need of a strong repulsive core . going beyond this maximum momentum is possible within a nn potential model approach , but it also faces the problem that the nn interaction needs to take into account a substantial inelasticity which would require explicit consideration of nucleon resonance production , such as @xmath9 or @xmath10 for @xmath11 both in the scattering as well as in the nuclear many body problem .",
    "there exist many possible ways and techniques to handle and analyze this problem ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) from this viewpoint . for our purposes we will follow the venerable brueckner - goldstone @xcite theory of nuclear matter .",
    "we believe this framework is a good starting point which provides sufficiently well the bulk properties of nuclear matter , in particular its saturation energy and equilibrium density .",
    "the formal derivation and the mathematical framework to carry out calculations within this theory were also provided by goldstone and bethe @xcite in terms of an integro - differential equation in configuration space .",
    "excellent reviews on this topic can be found on refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the main ingredients in solving the g - matrix in the brueckner - bethe - goldstone formalism is the two - nucleon potential @xmath12 .",
    "most early and modern so - called realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials @xcite contain parameters that are usually fitted to available scattering information up to a certain energy ( usually about pion production threshold ) , and they also provide the right static properties of the unique bound state of the two - nucleon system , namely the deuteron .    the av18 potential  @xcite is a popular and versatile choice which has attracted much attention from nuclear structure theorists since it describes np and pp scattering data with @xmath13 for lab energies up to @xmath14 .",
    "besides being local , it presents both a repulsive core and turns out to provide _ a fortiori _ a qualitative high energy description of scattering data when the inelasticity effects are neglected .",
    "our approach in this work will consist in taking a coarse grained delta shell potential whose strength parameters are fitted to obtain the same phase shifts as the av18 potential @xcite up to a laboratory kinetic energy of 2 gev .",
    "the coarse graining is based on the idea that if one wants to determine some nn scattering observables in a limited energy range , then the interaction potential only needs to be known in a limited number of points .",
    "the average separation of these points is related to the maximum resolution power which can be achieved within this upper limited energy range implying a shortest de broglie wavelength .",
    "the findings of this work are based on the early an insightful work by avils  @xcite which was rediscovered within a wilsonian renormalization perspective @xcite and fully exploited in nn scattering analysis @xcite to which we refer for further details .",
    "we emphasize that this simplification takes place in configuration space and we will exploit this feature explicitly in our analysis .",
    "since the appearance of the bethe - goldstone ( bg ) equation , several methods have been developed to solve it ( for a critical review on some of them we refer the reader to ref .",
    "most of the early treatments analyzed the problem in configuration space until haftel and tabakin introduced a momentum space solution via a direct matrix inversion method after some smoothing of nn interaction was implemented  @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that a repulsive core in configuration space generates long high momentum tails which inevitably lead to large matrices ( typical dimensions are of the order of @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "while it is possible to carry out such a coarse grained analysis we will proceed here directly by using the original integro - differential version of the bg equation .",
    "besides , some inherent difficulties in the bg solution have been overcome by resorting to approximate solutions .",
    "just to enumerate a few of them , we can mention : the treatment of the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion of the two - nucleon system ; the handling of the pauli blocking operator @xcite or the necessity ( or not ) of a partial wave decomposition @xcite .",
    "the first two of the above difficulties are easily overcome by choosing the kinematic configuration where the cm momentum of the nucleon pair is zero .",
    "this situation corresponds to a back - to - back configuration for the correlated nucleon pair , and recently it has drawn attention from the theoretical nuclear physics community @xcite as well as from the experimental electron @xcite and neutrino scattering physics communities @xcite .    in this work we try to keep the maximum simplicity as possible in the approach to this problem in order to properly understand the effects of all the ingredients involved and how are they mutually intertwined .",
    "therefore we try to be pedagogical and refrain from going beyond the s - wave configuration in a partial wave expansion .",
    "we also restrict our calculation to the back - to - back configuration for a nucleon pair at rest ( @xmath16 ) in order to avoid all the problems related to the cm motion , specifically the angular averaging of the pauli blocking operator .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the bethe - goldstone equation in coordinate representation for the correlated wave function .",
    "as originally recognized by bethe and goldstone this is particularly suited when there is a strong repulsive piece of the interaction .",
    "we also deal with the correlated wave function in momentum representation before entering , in section iii , into the discussion of the results on the high momentum tail of the momentum distribution , the @xmath2-matrix , and how the repulsive and attractive components are reshuffled depending on the resolution wavelength .",
    "finally we summarize our findings and outline our future plans in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the bethe - goldstone equation can be regarded as the in - medium scattering equation .",
    "this is an integral equation which , besides the effect of the inter - particle potential , also incorporates the effect of the surrounding medium by preventing the interacting nucleon pair from being scattered into the already occupied levels below the fermi momentum @xmath5 .",
    "here we review it so that our conventions and notation as well as our coarse grained method of solution and analysis can be more easily introduced in configuration space .",
    "while the original bg discussion has become textbook material  @xcite only some simple cases were discussed in a rather sketchy fashion .",
    "we hope that our presentation will be useful both for newcomers as well as researchers familiarized with the more popular momentum space approach .",
    "the bethe - goldstone equation for the wave function of an interacting nucleon pair in the independent - pair approximation @xcite can be written in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the heaviside or unit step function , and @xmath19 is the correlated wave function .",
    "this is given in terms of the unperturbed plane wave solution @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 ) plus the high momenta components @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) , which are weighted by the transition matrix element of the potential and the energy denominator that damps the largest energy differences with respect to the exact eigenvalue @xmath24 .",

    "( [ bg_wafunc ] ) we have particularized the solution of the b - g equation for the case of nuclear matter or a fermi gas , where the plane wave solutions with definite momenta are known to be the eigenfunctions of the uncorrelated system .    if we left - multiply eq . ( [ bg_wafunc ] ) by the bra @xmath29 , we get the correlated wave function in coordinate representation as @xmath30 where it is easier to notice the self - consistent integral character of the b - g equation .",
    "now we use the trick of changing all coordinate and momenta from particles variables to cm and relative ones @xmath31 furthermore , if the potential only depends on the relative coordinate @xmath32 and not on the cm one , further simplifications are possible .",
    "this kind of potentials preserve the cm motion and the correlated total wave function is separable into a product of a plane wave describing the free motion of the cm system and a correlated relative wave function @xmath33 that fulfills a bg - like equation @xcite @xmath34 and analogously for primed variables .    if the above expressions ( [ total_wafunc ] ) and ( [ unperturbed_wafunc ] ) are substituted into eq .",
    "( [ bg_wafunc_coor ] ) then the cm wave functions factorize and cancel on both sides and we are left with the bg - like equation for the correlated relative wave function @xmath33 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for the reduced mass of the two - nucleon system ; the energy denominator now only contains the difference between the initial and final relative kinetic energies ( the initial and final cm energies cancel in the denominator ) .",
    "the two step functions impose the conditions @xmath37 .",
    "one of the main complications in solving eq .",
    "( [ relative_bg_wafunc ] ) involves the integration over the angles of @xmath38 due to the presence of the step functions , which explicitly depend on the angle between @xmath39 and @xmath38 .",
    "for that reason an angular average of the projection operator is usually performed @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a full treatment of this problem in the general case ) .",
    "another possibility is simply considering the situation where @xmath40 , which corresponds to a back - to - back configuration for the two - nucleon system ( where the effect of nn correlations should be maximized ) .",
    "note that in the latter case the two step functions get reduced to a single one , simply implying that @xmath41 .",
    "up to this point the discussion has been quite general on the correlated wave function problem .",
    "next discussion can be also followed from refs @xcite , where the integral b - g equation for the relative wave function ( [ relative_bg_wafunc ] ) is transformed in an integro - differential equation by applying the operator @xmath42 on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ relative_bg_wafunc ] ) and taking the especial case when @xmath40 . indeed , we have then @xmath43 where in the last steps we have used the property of the heaviside function @xmath44 and the orthonormality condition of the plane waves @xmath45    now we expand the wave function @xmath46 in partial waves . for simplicity in this work",

    "thus the correlation function approaches oscillatory to unity .    in figure [ momdist ]",
    "we show the high - momentum radial @xmath108 wave function @xmath187 of the back - to - back correlated pair , for relative momenta @xmath183 and @xmath184 mev / c , respectively , computed with several coarse grained potentials , and compared to the av18 potential .",
    "the square of this function will contribute to the high - momentum tail induced by the short - range correlations in the momentum distribution .    from the figure we observe that , above the fermi momentum , which has been fixed in this work to @xmath188 mev / c , and below p = 400 mev / c , all the potentials basically give the same high - momentum tail . moreover the results between @xmath189 and 600 mev are very similar , and above @xmath190 their differences start to be more pronounced .",
    "going back to figure [ phaseshifts ] , we can see that a common feature of these potentials is that they produce the same phase - shifts for lab energy below 250 mev . from these results , we conclude that the phase - shift information above 250 mev in kinetic lab energy is irrelevant to properly describe the high - momentum tail up to 400 mev / c .",
    "a similar case arises when comparing the results of the potentials gr6 , gr7 and av18 . these three interactions give essentially the same high - momentum tail up to 1000 mev / c . when looking at figure [ phaseshifts ] , one can observe that these three potentials describe the same phase shifts up to 1000 mev in lab energy , thus suggesting again that additional information contained in the phase - shifts beyond that energy has no influence in the high - momentum tail of the correlated wave function below @xmath191 mev / c .",
    "a closer view of the differences between the high momentum tail induced by the different interactions is provided in figure [ momdistsquared ] , where we show the square of the momentum wave function @xmath192 , plotted in logarithmic scale .",
    "this function is proportional to the high momentum distribution of the back - to - back nucleon pair in relative @xmath173s@xmath193 state , where the well known minimum at @xmath194 mev / c , produced by the node of the wave function , is apparent .",
    "an important quantity for the assessment of the short range correlations is the value of the radial wave function at the origin , provided in our formalism by the constant @xmath137 @xmath195 in figure [ renorm ] we show the values of @xmath137 for the different potentials considered in this work .",
    "these values are plotted against the initial relative momentum @xmath132 of the back - to - back nucleon pair . in our approach the value of @xmath137",
    "is computed in each iteration by imposing the condition that the correlated wave function @xmath114 goes to the uncorrelated one @xmath139 for large values of @xmath196 .",
    "the values plotted in fig . [ renorm ] correspond to the 6th iteration to solve the bg equation , after convergence is reached .",
    "the importance of these curves lies in the fact that they correspond to the values that should be given as the initial guess in the iterative procedure to reach convergence in only one iteration .    by inspection of figure [ renorm ]",
    "we see that for all the potentials considered here , the @xmath137-values are quite stable in the whole range of relative momenta @xmath132 up to the fermi momentum , @xmath188 mev / c .",
    "there is only a small enhancement at the end of the curves when one is approaching the fermi momentum .    the value @xmath137 measures the hardness of the potential at short distances . the larger the value of @xmath197 ( the amplitude of the first repulsive delta shell ) the smaller the value of @xmath137 , and the smaller the wave function at short distances .",
    "it is instructive to separate in fig .",
    "[ rep - attrac ] the contribution of the attractive and repulsive parts of the potential to the high momentum tail of the wave function . for the coarse grained potentials ,",
    "the first delta shell is positive and repulsive , while the others are negative and attractive .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ momentum - wave ] ) the potential enters into the momentum tail through the sum @xmath198 .",
    "we thus can separate this sum into two terms including only the repulsive @xmath199 and attractive @xmath200 parts of the potential .",
    "the results of this separation are shown in fig .",
    "[ rep - attrac ] for @xmath201 mev .",
    "as can be seen in the case of the av18 potential , where @xmath202 for @xmath203 and @xmath204 otherwise , the repulsive short - distance piece including the core gives a positive and large momentum tail , which is partly compensated by the negative contribution stemming from the attractive longer range potential .",
    "this effect is reproduced with the coarse grained gr7 potential which is equivalent , as shown before , to the av18 potential both for the phase - shift and for the high - momentum wave function .",
    "however , this feature depends strongly on the resolution scale @xmath205 . in the bottom panel of the figure we observe that , in the case of the gr4 potential , the repulsive contribution is much smaller than the attractive contribution which gives alone almost the same total momentum tail as the av18 or gr7 potentials .",
    "in fact most of the high - momentum tail is here dominated by the second , attractive delta located at @xmath206 fm .",
    "this remarkable feature suggests that the short - range correlations can be traced back primarily _ not _ to the traditional repulsive core phenomenology but rather to the _ attractive mid - range _ part of the interaction .",
    "this opens a gateway to a perturbative treatment of short - range correlations which will be exploited elsewhere .",
    "our analysis also explains a feature which has been systematically found in large scale calculations , namely the appearance of an universal diffraction minimum at @xmath189 mev in the @xmath108 momentum distribution @xcite . according to our analysis ,",
    "this is due to the fact that in the gr4 potential the high - momentum tail in the wave function is dominated by the second delta shell , located at @xmath207 . according to eq.([momentum - wave ] )",
    "the contribution in the s - wave is proportional to @xmath208 which vanishes for @xmath209 .",
    "let us mention that the momentum representation given in eq .",
    "( [ momentum - wave ] ) , suggests a simple way of parameterizing the high momentum components of the wave function .",
    "the short range correlations are encoded into the quantities @xmath210 , @xmath211 , which in principle could be parameterized with smooth functions which do not depend strongly on @xmath132 .",
    "this could open an interesting line of research to investigate if information about these `` coarse - graining correlation functions '' , @xmath212 , could be experimentally extracted for example in two - nucleon knock - out experiments such as @xmath213 .",

    "the gr4 potential agrees well with both of them for @xmath218 , and start to considerably differ for @xmath219 mev / c .",
    "it is a striking result that , being the three potentials ( av18 , gr7 and gr4 ) so different in momentum space , they generate essentially the same g - matrix for momenta below @xmath220 .",
    "this is because the @xmath2-matrix embodies the short - range correlations through the already mentioned coarse - grained correlation functions @xmath221 .",
    "as we have seen the information encoded in these functions can be separated into repulsive and attractive contributions that , in the average , are very similar for all the potentials considered here .",
    "a deeper insight is provided in fig .",
    "[ g - matrix2 ] , where we show the separate repulsive and attractive parts of the nn potential in momentum space @xmath222 , and its corresponding contributions to the @xmath2-matrix . in the case of the av18 potential",
    "the repulsive and attractive g - matrices are large and opposite in sign and partially cancel in the total @xmath2-matrix .",
    "the same can be said in the case of the gr7 potential , that gives essentially the same repulsive and attractive @xmath2-matrices as the av18 potential .",
    "however the gr4 potential provides a different case , where the repulsive contribution to the @xmath2-matrix is negligible , while the attractive part of the potential generates alone almost the full @xmath2-matrix .",
    "note also that in the case of the av18 and gr7 interactions , @xmath215 is very different from @xmath222 .",
    "however the gr4 potential is very similar to its @xmath2-matrix .",
    "in fact , this suggest once more that one could use directly the gr4 interaction to investigate the role of short - range correlations in perturbation theory .    for momenta below @xmath223 ,",
    "one expect that the diagonal @xmath2-matrix , @xmath167 , to be identified with the effective nn interaction inside the nucleus , be also quite stable for all the interactions .",

    "for the three interactions av18 , gr7 and gr4 in the @xmath108 channel . we have multiplied these functions by a normalization factor so that these curves can be compared with the usual definition of the @xmath225 potential @xcite , which has already been proposed as a convenient effective interaction in the nucleus , and that in fact is very similar to our results in figure [ g - diagonal ] .",
    "finally , in figure [ gkf ] we show the diagonal @xmath2-matrix computed for @xmath214 as a function of the fermi momentum , in a range that covers the fermi momentum of finite nuclei , nuclear matter , and extends well above the @xmath5 values expected for neutron stars .",
    "the @xmath2-matrix close the fermi surface is related to the effective interaction of the landau - migdal finite fermi systems , and it should describe the particle - hole interaction near the fermi surface .",
    "the gr4 potential give the same results as the ones of gr7 and av18 for @xmath226 mev , while they start to disagree for larger @xmath5-values .",
    "in this work we have explored the role of coarse grained interactions in the study of short - range correlations in nuclei , in terms of the high momentum components in the back - to - back nucleon pair wave functions .",
    "we remind that these components have traditionally been linked to the existence of a strong repulsive core between nucleons located at about @xmath227 , preventing any kind of perturbative treatment , and promoting large scale calculations to befit the complexity of the problem . on the other hand , for a maximum back - to - back",
    "momentum @xmath166 there corresponds a limiting resolution wavelength @xmath228 which effectively samples the nuclear wave function as well as the corresponding nn interaction above the repulsive core scale @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we expect some cancellation between the repulsive and attractive parts of the interaction in the region around the core for @xmath229 , which means @xmath230 .",
    "previous experience fitting and selecting nn data in high precision partial wave analysis suggests that this `` moderately '' high momentum and core - blind regime might exist .",
    "conversely , this also seems to imply that genuine repulsive - core features start being visible for @xmath231 .",
    "therefore , as a first step in this exploratory work , we have addressed the problem of solving the bethe - goldstone equation in the @xmath0s@xmath1 partial wave for several delta - shell potentials , including the fine - grained version of the av18 potential .",
    "the strengths of the delta - shell potentials have been fitted to reproduce the same phase shifts as the av18 up to a certain kinetic energy in the lab frame .",
    "we have first developed a very efficient method to solve the bethe - goldstone equation in coordinate space for this @xmath0s@xmath1 channel , obtaining convergence for the reduced wave function @xmath114 after six iterations . with this solution",
    "we have studied the role of short - range correlations to induce high momentum components in the two - nucleon wave function .",
    "we have also obtained two - nucleon momentum distributions for this @xmath89-wave component and we have analyzed the values @xmath137 of the radial wave function at the origin .",
    "we have compared our coarse - grained results with those obtained with av18 potential , which embodies many of the traditionally assumed features of the nn interaction , such as the repulsive core , and provides a good description of nn phase - shifts up to np lab energy of 2 gev .",
    "we find a few appealing features of the present approach .    * a huge reduction in the dimensionality of the problem is observed . in the studied @xmath108",
    "wave much of the accessible information requires sampling the nn interaction with only a few ( 47 ) mesh points .",
    "the coarse - grain interactions embodies all needed information on high momentum components of the nuclear wave function up to @xmath1901000 mev , while accurately reproducing the av18 @xmath108 phase - shifts up to lab energies of 1 gev .",
    "we expect this feature to hold in more peripheral partial waves , including the effects of the tensor interaction in the @xmath232 channel .",
    "* we also witness a marginal contribution of the repulsive core so that , quite unexpectedly , a perturbative treatment of short - range correlations as observed in terms of high momentum components is envisaged .",
    "this is due to a suitable choice of the coarse graining scale which allows a dominance of the attractive contribution due to a reduction of the repulsive one .",
    "* we provide a simple explanation of the universally observed diffraction minimum in the high momentum distribution in the @xmath108 channel .",
    "a pertinent question is : since the input is dictated by the phase - shifts , what is the gain in using the av18 potential instead of directly data from pwa ? .",
    "moreover , one can argue that at 1 - 2 gev inelasticities due to production of nucleon resonances should be important , which makes the comparison of a real potential such as av18 with a _",
    "complex _ phase - shift ( or real phase - shift and inelasticity parameter ) a bit tricky . on the other hand , we are interested in the high momentum components of low - energy nucleons within the nucleus or nuclear matter .",
    "future plans include to solve the problem for higher partial waves , including coupled - channels induced by the nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "also this approach will allow to construct an electroweak two - body correlation current , of interest for studying nucleon knockout reactions for high initial nucleon momenta , which selects the short - range correlated pairs , in the formalism of refs .",

    "<S> we develop a scheme to take into account the effects of short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations in the nucleon - pair wave function by solving the bethe - goldstone equation for a coarse grained delta shell potential in s - wave configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the s - wave delta shell potential has been adjusted to reproduce the @xmath0s@xmath1 phase shifts of the av18 potential for this partial wave up to 2 gev in the laboratory kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a coarse grained potential can describe the high momentum tail of the back - to - back correlated pairs and the @xmath2-matrix in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the easiness and robustness of the calculation in coordinate space and the future improvements and utilities of this model . </S>",
    "<S> this work suggests the possibility of using perturbation theory for describing the short - range correlations , and related to this , to substitute the @xmath2-matrix by an appropriate coarse - grained potential . </S>"
