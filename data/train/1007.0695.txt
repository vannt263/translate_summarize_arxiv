    "it is known @xcite that an almost simple spine can be easily constructed from practically any representation of a manifold .",
    "the rather large number of manifolds in @xcite gives rise to a new task of finding potentially sharp upper bounds for the complexity , i.e. upper bounds that would yield the exact value of the complexity for all manifolds from the table @xcite .",
