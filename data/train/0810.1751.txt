    "while the standard model ( sm ) describes the observed physics processes well at low and moderate energies , there is a possibility of existence of new physics beyond the sm , which manifests mostly at high energies .",
    "studies of diboson production can lead to a potential discovery of @xmath3 resonances predicted in a number of sm extensions : vector @xmath4 , scalar higgs bosons , pseudo - scalar toponium , and techniparticles  @xcite .",
    "the d0 collaboration has already performed a search for such resonances in the following channels : @xmath5 using 300 pb@xmath1 of data  @xcite .",
    "this current analysis  @xcite draws on the previous one , but only in the narrow resonance approximation : the total width of a resonance must be smaller than the detector resolution . the previous analysis is expanded by adding a vector resonance hypothesis .",
    "the scalar resonance is modeled with pythia  @xcite using the sm higgs boson production model , and madevent @xcite is used to model a colorless , neutral , vector resonance .",
    "diagrams for both processes are shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath3 final state is obtained by selecting events with a pair of energetic isolated leptons of the same family ( electrons with transverse energy @xmath9  15  gev or muons with transverse momentum @xmath10  15  gev/@xmath11 ) and a photon candidate , separated from both leptons by @xmath12  0.7 .",
    "both electron and photon candidates are reconstructed from isolated  @xcite electromagnetic ( em ) showers in the calorimeter with at least 90% of their energy deposited in the em part of the calorimeter . in each event , photon candidate and",
    "at least one electron candidate are required to be identified in the central calorimeter .",
    "in addition , em showers from electrons must be spatially matched to tracks found in the tracking system . by imposing an additional requirement on the sum of @xmath13 of all tracks , reconstructed in the annulus with opening angles of @xmath14 0.05 and 0.4 around the photon s trajectory , not to exceed 1.5 gev/@xmath11 , we substantially reduce the em - like jets  @xcite background . in the muon channel , we select only those events in which muon candidates are reconstructed not back - to - back with an opening angle @xmath15 , and are produced in the same vertex . to further reduce backgrounds , we require muons to be isolated from activity in both calorimeter and tracking detectors .",
    "we also require the di - electron ( dimuon ) pair to be separated by @xmath16 ( @xmath17 0.5 ) . to reduce systematic uncertainty due to the trigger efficiency",
    ", we require the @xmath18 of the leading electron candidate to exceed  25  gev and the @xmath13 of the leading muon candidate to exceed 20 gev/@xmath11 where the d0 triggers are fully efficient .",
    "the sensitivity to new physics resonances strongly depends on the detector resolution .",
    "typical @xmath19 resolution is on the order of 5% in the electron channel , while in the muon channel this number varies from  8% to  18% , depending on the resonance mass . to improve the resolution of @xmath20 , we correct the transverse momenta of muon candidates that appear to be produced from the on - shell @xmath21 boson by using the @xmath21 boson nominal mass constraint . to further increase the analysis sensitivity",
    ", we vary cuts on photon transverse momentum and dilepton invariant mass to have the maximal @xmath22 ratio .",
    "the resulting cuts are photon @xmath23  20 gev and dilepton mass @xmath2480  gev/@xmath25 .",
    "due to the fact that the total efficiency depends not only on the spin of the resonance ( vector or scalar ) but also on the lepton family ( electron or muon ) , we study the following four cases separately : vector resonance in the electron or muon channel , and scalar resonance in the electron or muon channel .",
    "afterwards , we combine electron and muon channel results for each type of resonance . the total efficiency of the set of cuts described in the previous section multiplied by the geometrical and kinematic acceptance varies between 7% and 20% for both types of resonances .",
    "these numbers include @xmath266068% ( 79% ) electron ( muon ) identification efficiency per pair , 9295% photon reconstruction efficiency , and 99% ( 68% ) electron ( muon ) trigger efficiency .",
    "there are only two significant sources of background to the @xmath3 final state : the sm @xmath3 production and the @xmath21+jet production , where an em - like jet passes all photon selection criteria .",
    "the jet misreconstruction rate is an @xmath18-dependent function , and is defined as a ratio of em - like jets that pass photon selection criteria to all em objects that are reconstructed in the geometrical acceptance of the central calorimeter .",
    "the direct photon contribution , however , has to be subtracted from this rate .",
    "furthermore , two data samples are used to estimate the @xmath21+jet background : a sample that consists of real photons and em - like jets , and a second one in which photon candidates fail the track isolation and photon shower shape requirements  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the @xmath21+jet background to be @xmath27 events in the electron channel and @xmath28 events in the muon channel .",
    "the leading - order ( lo ) baur event generator  @xcite is used to estimate the number of sm @xmath3 background events .",
    "the trilinear @xmath29 and @xmath30 couplings are set to their sm values ( zero ) , and , in addition , the lo photon @xmath18  spectrum is corrected for the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) effects using the @xmath18-dependent @xmath31-factor from the nlo baur event generator  @xcite .",
    "the sm @xmath3 background is estimated to be @xmath32 events in the electron channel and @xmath33 events in the muon channel . applying all the selection criteria in data",
    "yields 49 @xmath34 and 50 @xmath35 candidate events .",
    "the combined @xmath19 distribution from both channels is compared with the backgrounds and examined for any discrepancies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mllg_vector ] ) .",
    "the @xmath19 distributions from various mc signals of a vector resonance are also shown in figure  [ fig : mllg_vector ] .",
    "a thorough examination revealed no excess of the observed data over the theoretical expectations , thus allowing us to set limits on the production of resonances decaying into @xmath3 .",
    "to set limits we explore the modified frequentist method  @xcite with poisson log - likelihood ratio test statistic ( llr )  @xcite with gaussian uncertainties as the quantitative measure of the difference between the background - only hypothesis and the signal - plus - background one that predicts a @xmath3 resonance .",
    "we derive 95% c.l .",
    "upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction , that range from 0.19 ( 0.20 ) pb to 2.5 ( 3.1 ) pb for a scalar ( vector ) resonance .",
    "the resulting exclusion curves for @xmath2 are shown in figure  [ fig : scalar_limit ] for the vector and scalar models .",
