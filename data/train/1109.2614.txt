    "detection of the fe k@xmath0 ( 6.4 kev ) line from molecular clouds in the galactic center ( gc ) is one of the most remarkable events in the high energy astrophysics of the last decades .",
    "the story had started from 1993 when @xcite found a diffuse x - ray emission from compact sources in the gc .",
    "they interpreted this emission as due to reflection of photons by dense molecular clouds ( compton echo ) which were irradiated by a nearby x - ray source .",
    "in addition , they predicted a bright fluorescent k@xmath0 line in the scattered spectrum of the clouds due to the k - absorption of photons with energies @xmath4 kev .",
    "this line was indeed discovered soon afterwards by @xcite .",
    "the brightest region of the 6.4 kev emission was located over the giant molecular cloud sgr b2 . later on the 6.4 kev emission",
    "was discovered also in other molecular clouds of the gc ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) speculated that the 6.4 kev flux from sgr b2 is due to the past activity of the the galactic nucleus sgr a@xmath1 which had been bright several hundred years ago but is currently dim . from the observed flux of 6.4 kev photons from the cloud ,",
    "@xmath5 ph @xmath6 s@xmath3 , and the gas column density of the cloud the differential spectrum of primary photons @xmath7 can be estimated from the equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the volume of the cloud , @xmath10 is the emissivity of 6.4 kev photons at the coordinate @xmath11 inside the cloud and @xmath12 is the distance to earth .",
    "the spectrum of primary photons can be derived from the observed continuum emission from sgr b2 which in the case of the xrn scenario is the same as the spectrum of primary photons .",
    "@xcite showed that these spectrum was a power - law with the spectral index of @xmath13 in the energy range 210 kev ( see also @xcite ) @xmath14 the 210 kev luminosity of primary photons from sgr a@xmath1 necessary to produce the observed 6.4 kev emission from sgr b2 was estimated by @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distance between sgr a@xmath1 and sgr b2 .",
    "the most direct evidence to favor the photoionization by an x - ray flash of the central source would be a time variability of the 6.4 kev line emission from molecular clouds because of a relatively short time in which a photon crosses them .",
    "this idea about the sgr a@xmath17 past activity as the origin of 6.4 kev emission from sgr b2 was confirmed recently .",
    "observations found a steady decrease of the x - ray flux from sgr  b2 for the period @xmath18 years .",
    "time variations of the emission are expected in the xrn model and interpreted as photoionization of iron atoms by a flux of primary x - rays emitted by the central source sgr a@xmath1 due to an x - ray flare occurred there about 100300 years ago @xcite .      in principle",
    "a flux of the 6.4 kev line can also be generated by collisions of subrelativistic charged particles with the molecular gas in the gc .",
    "thus , @xcite accounted the impact of subrelativistic electrons with energies 10  100 kev from local sources with diffuse neutral gas producing both nonthermal bremsstrahlung x - ray continuum emission and diffuse 6.4 kev line emission .",
    "@xcite suggested a scenario for the 6.4 kev line emission from molecular clouds which was excited by a flux of subrelativistic protons produced by star accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "below these two scenarios are denoted as the low energy cosmic - ray electron model ( lecre ) and the low energy cosmic - ray proton model ( lecrp ) .",
    "we note that because of relatively long life time of protons in comparison with the average time of star capture the lecrp component of 6.4 kev line emission in the gc is quasi - stationary .",
    "generation of the 6.4 kev line is accompanied by a continuum x - ray emission produced by the thomson scattering for the xrn scenario and by bremsstrahlung for the lecre and lecrp models .",
    "therefore the origin of 6.4 kev line flux from the clouds can be defined from the analysis of the equivalent width _ ew _ of the iron line in the spectrum which is the ratio of the line flux to the continuum intensity at @xmath19 kev , @xmath20 the width is a function of the iron abundance @xmath21 in the clouds .    from estimations of _ ew",
    "_ for the cloud sgr b2 @xcite concluded that the photoionization interpretation seemed to be more attractive in comparison with the electron impact scenario .",
    "the required abundance of iron in the cloud was estimated by @xcite by the value @xmath22 solar .",
    "however , @xcite might find the iron line emission which was produced by subrelativistic particles .",
    "they presented results of eight years of xmm - newton observations of the region surrounding the arches cluster in the galactic center .",
    "they analyzed spatial distribution and temporal behavior of the 6.4 kev line emission and concluded that the origin of this emission might be of the photoionization origin , although excitation by cosmic - ray particles was not excluded .",
    "moreover , they concluded that for the three clouds nearest to the arches cluster , which showed a constant flux over the 8-year observation , the origin of the line as photoionization by photons from sgr a@xmath1 seemed to be at best tentative , and the hardness of the nonthermal component associated with the 6.4-kev line emission might be best explained in terms of bombardment by cosmic - ray particles .",
    "recent suzaku observations might also find the iron line emission which was produced by subrelativistic particles @xcite .",
    "for the clumps g0.174@xmath230.233 with @xmath24 ev they concluded that the xrn scenario was favored . on the other hand ,",
    "for the clump g0.162@xmath230.217 with @xmath25 ev they assumed that the emission from there was due to low energy cosmic - ray electron ( lecre ) .",
    "they found also that the @xmath26 of the 6.4 kev emission line detected in the x - ray faint region ( non galactic molecular cloud region ) was significantly lower than one expected in the xrn scenario but higher than that of the lecre model .",
    "@xcite showed that estimates of _ ew _ alone did not allow to distinguish firmly between the xrn and lecr scenarios because in the latter case the value of _ ew _ depended strongly on a spectral index of ionizing charged particles , especially if they were subrelativistic protons . in the case of ionization by charged particles",
    "spatial characteristics of 6.4 kev line are expected quite different for electrons and protons .",
    "while for electrons we expect rather local ionization of the medium because of their relatively short lifetime , protons can fill an extended region around the gc .",
    "if protons generate 6.4 kev line in the gc then at least two components of 6.4 kev line emission from the molecular clouds and the diffuse molecular gas can be generated there .",
    "the first one is a time variable component generated by a flare of primary x - rays emitted by sgr a@xmath1 , and the second is a quasi - stationary component produced by subrelativistic protons interacting with the gas .",
    "observations of the 6.4  kev flux from sgr b2 have not found up to now any evident stationary component for the gc molecular clouds , though as predicted by @xcite a fast decrease of 6.4 kev emission observed with xmm - newton for several molecular clouds suggested that the emission generated by low energy cosmic - rays , if present , might become dominant in several years .",
    "a component of another than that of the xrn origin may also be seen in the x - ray spectrum of faint molecular regions in the gc as follows from @xcite .",
    "below we derive parameters of the diffuse 6.4 kev line emission in the framework of the xrn and lecrp models in attempts to define the origin of the observed diffuse line flux from the gc .",
    "the intensity of the diffuse 6.4 kev line from the gc depends on parameters of the intercloud molecular gas there .",
    "the inner bulge ( 200300 pc central region ) contains @xmath27 of hydrogen gas . in spite of relatively small radius",
    "this region contains about 10% of the galaxy s molecular mass .",
    "half of the molecular gas is contained in very compact clouds of mass @xmath28 , average densities of which is @xmath29 @xmath30 with a volume filling factor of only a few per cent , then the cloud radius is in the range 140 pc .",
    "the other half forms the molecular intercloud gas with the densities of at least @xmath31 @xmath30 ( see @xcite ) . @xcite estimated for the inner @xmath32 pc region the averaged molecular hydrogen density @xmath33 to be 140 @xmath30 assuming homogeneous matter distribution , and for a thin intercloud medium @xmath34 @xmath30 .",
    "recently @xcite provided careful analysis with high energy resolution and low background of the diffuse 6.4 kev emission and of the hard x - ray continuum associated with this line in the gc region . from the suzaku data they estimated the continuum x - ray emission which is proportional to the intensity of diffuse 6.4 kev line .",
    "more recently @xcite provided a careful analysis of 6.4 kev emission from the region around the gc .",
    "their spatial distribution of 6.4 kev line in the gc is shown in figure [ 6.4_dist_l ] where spikes of this emission correspond to directions to molecular clouds .",
    "( 130mm,130mm)64a_data.eps    we expect that characteristics of the 6.4 kev emission produced by subrelativistic cosmic - rays and by a flux of primary x - ray photons are quite different . below we reproduce spatial distributions of the 6.4 kev line in the framework of xrn and lecrp models .",
    "it is assumed in the xrn model that sgr a@xmath1 was active for about @xmath35 years in the past as an emitter of primary x - ray photons with the energy @xmath36 .",
    "the average luminosity of this source during the active period is @xmath37 for the range 210 kev .",
    "the source activity is supposed to cease @xmath38 years ago .    for the observed spectrum ( [ koya_sp ] ) we define the total density of primary photons on the divergent front of primary photons , which is at the distance @xmath11 from sgr a@xmath1 , as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the minimum and maximum energies of the spectrum of primary photons .",
    "then the differential spectrum of primary photons @xmath7 for the total photon density ( [ nph ] ) we present as @xmath42 whith the normalization condition for @xmath43 @xmath44 therefore for the spectrum ( [ koya_sp ] ) we have @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the heaviside step function .",
    "these primary photons ionize iron atoms .",
    "the cross - section of photoionization @xmath47 has a form @xmath48 where @xmath49 kev and @xmath50 @xmath51 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then the emissivity of the 6.4 kev line is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the fluorescence yield of x - ray photon emission , which is about 0.3 for iron .",
    "the average density of the diffuse molecular gas was defined as @xmath33 .",
    "below we take everywhere for calculations @xmath54 @xmath30 and assume a uniform density distribution of the molecular gas in the gc that gives an upper limit of diffuse 6.4 kev emission from the gc . the iron abundance @xmath21",
    "is supposed to equal twice solar , @xmath55 .    for the delay time",
    "@xmath38 we can observe at present an irradiate emission of the diffuse gas which is on surface of the parabola ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath56\\ , , \\label{surf}\\ ] ] where the coordinates @xmath57 and @xmath58 are shown in figure [ geom ] .",
    "unlike the line emission from compact molecular clouds which can be observed for a relatively short period of time when the x - ray front is crossing a cloud ( @xmath59 years ) , the diffuse 6.4 kev emission produced by primary x - ray photons should be permanently observed from the gc as the front of primary x - ray photons is propagating though the diffuse molecular gas in the gc .",

    "( 100mm,100mm)spatial_fe_x.eps    from this figure one can see that unlike emission from molecular clouds , which can be observed for short periods of their irradiation ( @xmath59 years ) , the diffuse emission of 6.4 kev line from the gc can be permanently seen for @xmath86 year even when a period of x - ray protons injection by sgr a@xmath1 is quite short .",

    "we notice , however , that the x - ray flare duration from sgr a@xmath1 may be much shorter that estimated by @xcite .",

    "the required luminosity of the flare in this case should be about @xmath91 erg s@xmath3 that is still compatible with the estimate of @xcite because the real distance from sgr a@xmath1 to sgr b2 may be longer than the projection distance of 100 pc .",
    "if , however , the flare of sgr a@xmath1 occurred 300 yr ago , then the required luminosity is @xmath92 erg s@xmath3 .    as it was shown in @xcite and @xcite the equivalent width of the iron line provided information about the line origin since the continuum and line x - ray emission were generated by the same primary particles ( photons or subrelativistic charged particles ) .",

    "( 100mm,100mm)ews_r.eps    we notice , however , it is not easy to compare this distribution of _ ew _ with that derived from observations because it is not easy to subtract a component of diffuse x - ray emission produced by the compton scattering from the total flux of x - ray in the direction of gc : a significant contribution of thermal emission is expected from there .",
    "therefore , a special procedure to subtract a compton component of continuum emission is necessary , as it was done e.g. in @xcite .",
    "another mechanism which can generate a diffuse component of 6.4 kev emission in the gc is bombardment of the interstellar molecular gas by subrelativistic protons whose lifetime is long enough to fill an extended region around the gc .",

    "it is highly improbable to observe the stationary component of this line produced by the protons from the diffuse molecular gas in the foreseeable future .",

    "the diffuse emission of the 6.4 kev line in the gc region was recently observed with suzaku .",
    "only two components can generate ionization of the molecular gas in this extended region , namely , hard x - ray photons or subrelativistic protons with energies about 100 mev . because of their long lifetime hard x - ray photons and subrelativistic protons can propagate over large distances .",
    "temporal characteristics of the diffuse line emission differ from that of compact clouds .",
    "emission produced by photoionization in the clouds shows temporal variations with the characteristic time about several years that corresponds to the time in which a photon crosses the cloud . on the other hand , the diffuse emission generated by photionization changes with the characteristic time about @xmath135 yr .",
    "protons in both cases generate a stationary flux of the line emission .",

    "the main problem of lecrp model is that we do nt know reliable estimates of protons injection by accretion processes , the proton spectrum , characteristics of proton propagation in the central region ( diffusion coefficient ) etc . with all these uncertainties",
    "we can conclude that at present the xrn model seems to be more attractive for interpretation of the diffuse line emission in the gc than the lecrp model though we can not exclude that protons may contribute a significant part of the diffuse flux .",
    "we hope that more reliable conclusions can be obtained in the near future .",
    "the first key results would be if observations find a stationary component of 6.4 kev line emission from molecular clouds . in this case",
    "the density of subrelativistic photons and a flux of diffuse line emission generated by protons can be estimated for the gc region .",
    "another very important parameter of the emission can be obtained with the planned astro - h mission .",

    "<S> we analyze the diffuse fe k @xmath0 line generated in the diffuse interstellar molecular hydrogen by primary photons or subrelativistic protons injected by sagittarius ( sgr ) a@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that unlike emission from compact molecular clouds , this emission can be permanently observed in the directions of the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the diffuse emission of 6.4 kev line observed at present is probably due to fe k @xmath0 vacancy production by primary photons if the x - ray luminosity of sgr a@xmath1 was about @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> these data can also be described in the framework of the model when the 6.4 kev line emission is generated by subrelativistic protons generated by accretion onto the central black hole but in this case extreme parameters of this model are necessary . </S>"
