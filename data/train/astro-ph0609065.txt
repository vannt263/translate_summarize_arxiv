    "the metal abundances in the intracluster medium ( icm ) and the hot x - ray emitting interstellar medium ( ism ) of early - type galaxies provide important clues to understand the metal enrichment history and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the icm contains a large amount of metals , which are mainly synthesized by supernova ( sn ) in early - type galaxies ( e.g. , arnaud et al.1992 ; renzini et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the asca satellite ( tanaka et al .  1994 ) first enabled us to measure the distribution of fe in the icm ( e.g. , fukazawa et al .",
    "2000 ; finoguenov et al .",
    "2000 ; 2001 ) .",
    "the derived iron - mass - to - light ratio ( imlr ) is nearly constant in rich clusters and decreases toward poorer systems ( makishima et al .",
    "2001 ) . in individual clusters ,",
    "the imlr is lower around the center ( makishima et al .",
    "the si abundance of the icm was also measured by asca ( fukazawa et al .  1998;2000 ; finoguenov et al .  2000 ; 2001 ) , however , since fe and si are both synthesized in sn ia and sn ii , abundance results for these species can not clearly constrain the nucleosynthesis contribution from different sn types .",
    "in contrast , o and mg are predominantly synthesized in sne ii .",
    "abundance measurements spanning the range of species from o to fe are therefore needed to obtain unambiguous information on the formation history of massive stars .",
    "xmm - newton provided the means to measure o and mg abundances in some systems , but reliable results have been obtained only for the central regions of very bright clusters or groups of galaxies dominated by cd galaxies ( e.g. , xu et al.2002 , finoguenov et al .",
    "2002 , tamura et al .",
    "2003 , matsushita et al.2003 , 2006 ; buote et al ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "in general , the measured abundances of si and fe are similar , while the o abundance is only about half of the fe abundance .",
    "this indicates that cd galaxies are an important source of si and fe which are mainly synthesized in sn ia .",
    "however , our knowledge about the distributions of o and mg in the icm is still poor , in contrast to the detailed measurement of the fe and si abundances with xmm - newton ( e.g. , tamura et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "regarding early - type galaxies , the metal abundances in the ism give us important information about the present metal supply into the icm through sn ia and stellar mass loss .",
    "in addition , o and mg abundances should reflect the stellar metallicity and enable us to directly look into the formation history of these galaxies .    in this paper ,",
    "based on suzaku ( mitsuda et al .",
    "2006 ) observations , the abundances of o , mg , si , s and fe of the icm in the fornax cluster and those of o , ne , mg and fe of the ism in ngc 1404 are discussed .",
    "the xis ( koyama et al .  2006 ) instrument onboard suzaku has good energy resolution at the o line energy with low background , providing better sensitivity than the emos onboard xmm - newton .",
    "the emos also has a problem in measuring the mg abundance in somewhat fainter systems , due to a strong instrumental al line .",
    "the mg lines are particularly useful in cluster outskirts , since the strong galactic o line causes difficulty in the measurement of o emission from nearby clusters .",
    "the fornax cluster is a nearby poor cluster with an icm temperature of 1.3 - 1.5 kev ( e.g. , scharf et al .",
    "the x - ray emission shows asymmetric spatial distribution , and the cd galaxy , ngc 1399 , is offset from the center ( paolillo et al .",
    "2002 ; sharf et al .",
    "2005 ) , which may be related to large scale dynamical evolution such as infall motions of galaxies into the cluster ( dunn & jerjen 2006 ) .",
    "chandra observations suggests that there may be relative motion between ngc 1399 and the icm , and the 2nd brightest elliptical galaxy , ngc 1404 , is moving supersonically in the icm ( scharf et al .",
    "2005 ; machacek et al .",
    "2005 ) . for the icm abundances ,",
    "the fe and si abundances within @xmath3 kpc of ngc 1399 were measured with xmm - newton ( buote et al .",
    "however , due to the high background of xmm - newton , the o and mg abundances of the icm were not determined .",
    "asca detected excess hard x - ray emission from several groups of galaxies including the fornax cluster ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2001 ; nakazawa 2001 ) .",
    "dynamical motions in the cluster , driven by merger events , that generate a population of relativistic particles may be the origin of this emission component .",
    "suzaku results on hard emission from fornax will be presented in a separate article after a detailed study of detector background .",
    "we adopt solar abundances by feldman ( 1992 ) , where the solar o and fe abundances relative to h are @xmath4 and @xmath5 by number .",
    "recently , the solar photospheric abundances of c , n , o , and ne decreased by 0.2 dex , considering three - dimensional hydrostatic model atmospheres and non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( asplund 2005 and references therein ) . the new solar o and fe abundances relative to h are 4.90@xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ( lodders 2003 ) . the effect of the new solar abundances will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "we adopt 19 mpc ( for h@xmath8 = 72 km / s / mpc ) for the distance to the fornax cluster .",
    "the observation of cepheids with hubble space telescope yielded the distance of 18.6@xmath9 mpc ( madore et al .",
    "unless otherwise specified , errors are quoted at 90% confidence",
    "the fornax cluster was observed twice as a part of the initial performance verification of suzaku . the first observation ( hereafter , the central field )",
    "was carried out on september 2005 with pointing direction @xmath10 south and @xmath11 east of ngc 1399 .",
    "the second one ( hereafter , the north field ) was centered @xmath12 north and @xmath0 east of ngc 1399 , and was carried out on 2006 january . figure [ fig : image ] shows a 0.3 - 5.0 kev image for the two fields .",
    "the two peaks in the central field correspond to the cd galaxy , ngc 1399 , and the elliptical galaxy , ngc 1404 .",
    "both the x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis ; koyama et al .",
    "2006 ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) were operated in their nominal modes .",
    "we discarded the data taken with a cut - off rigidity less than 6 gv c@xmath13 , or elevation angle less than @xmath14 from the earth rim .",
    "this yielded exposure times of 68 ks and 85 ks for the central and the north fields , respectively .",
    "we used the response matrix files ae_xi[0,2,3]_segc_rmf_20060213.fit for the front side illuminated ( fi ) detectors , xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 , and ae_xi1_20060213c.rmf for the back side illuminated ( bi ) detector , xis1 .",
    "the energy range analyzed here covers 0.3 to 5.0 kev for the bi detector and 0.4 to 5.0 kev for the fi detectors .",
    "the on - axis auxiliary response files ae_xi[0,1,2,3]_xisnom4_20060415.arf are used for the respective detectors , since below 5 kev , the energy dependence of the auxiliary response file is smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "we also ignored the energy range between 1.82 and 1.84 kev in the spectral fit , since the response matrix around the si edge has some problem .",
    "the data from each xis detector were accumulated within concentric rings , centered on ngc 1399 .",
    "the spectrum of the bright galaxy ngc 1404 was separately analyzed , and a region with a radius of 4 centered on this galaxy was masked out for this portion of the analysis . as for the background , we have to consider the non x - ray background ( nxb ) , the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , and the galactic emission , which arises from the local hot bubble ( lhb ) and milky way halo ( mwh ) .",
    "figure [ fig : raw_spec ] shows the spectra for the outermost ( @xmath15 ) region of the fornax cluster , compared with the blank - sky ( lockman hole observed on 2005 november ) and the night - earth spectra accumulated over the same region of the detector . in the low energy band the lockman - hole data is not appropriate for the background , since the temperature and intensity of the galactic emission differ significantly with sky region and the low - energy efficiency of the xis instrument has been declining since launch due to contamination on the xis filters ( koyama et al .",

    "( 2000 ) derived the stellar luminosity profile of ngc 1399 out to nearly 1 degree from the galaxy center . at 130 kpc ,",
    "the b - band luminosity of ngc 1399 reaches @xmath49 . including the halo component ,",
    "the total b - band luminosity of all the galaxies within 130 kpc becomes @xmath50 .",
    "the gas mass profile was derived by paolillo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) based on the rosat data , and , within 130 kpc , the gas mass is estimated to be @xmath51 . as a result ,",
    "the o mass - to - light ratio ( omlr ) and fe mass - to - light ratio ( imlr ) within 130 kpc are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "these values are more than an order of magnitude lower than those for richer clusters . with asca ,",
    "the imlr for rich clusters was measured to be @xmath24 0.01@xmath54 , while groups of galaxies gave smaller values ( makishima et al .",
    "2001 ) , although angular resolution of asca often did not enough to obtain the metallicity distribution and the obtained imlr might be overestimated . with xmm , tamura et al .",
    "( 2004 ) derived imlr for several clusters within @xmath55 kpc to be @xmath56 .",
    "measurement of the omlr for rich clusters is not reliable ( tamura et al .",
    "2004 , kawaharada 2006 ) .",
    "our results can be compared with the centaurus cluster , whose temperature is 4 kev . within a radius of @xmath57 ,",
    "the omlr and imlr for the centaurus cluster are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , and about an order of magnitude larger than those in the fornax cluster ( matsushita et al.2006 ) .",
    "the total amount of fe and o , when normalized by the stellar luminosity and accumulated over the hubble time , should be similar among the clusters , unless much of these elements are lost from the system .",
    "the constancy of the metal mass would be the case in the fornax cluster , as well as in rich clusters , since most of the stellar light in the fornax cluster comes from bright old galaxies just as in rich clusters ( kuntschener 2000 ) .",
    "one difference between the poor and rich clusters is that the gas in poor clusters and groups of galaxies is more extended than in rich clusters compared with the stellar distribution ( e.g. , ponman et al .",
    "since the fe abundance in the icm does not depend on the icm temperature ( fukazawa et al.1998 ) , the difference in the omlr and imlr should almost purely reflect the difference in the gas fraction .",
    "since the hot gas in poor clusters and groups commonly show higher entropy than the case of pure gravitational heating ( e.g. , ponman et al .",
    "1999 ) , the gas in poor clusters , such as fornax , may have expanded significantly .",
    "the metal distribution in the icm may be used as a tracer of the history of such gas heating , since both metal enrichment and heating timescales determine the metal distribution in the icm .",
    "the o / fe ratios in the fornax cluster indicate that the fe has been mostly produced by sn ia .",
    "if the gas and stellar distribution remain the same within 130 kpc of ngc 1399 , the accumulation time scale by sn ia may be much shorter than the hubble time . therefore , significant amounts of o and mg has to come from stellar mass loss , although the time dependence of the mass loss rate and sn ia rate is not clear .",
    "therefore , within a radius of @xmath60 in the fornax cluster , the omlr directly ejected from old sn ii may be even lower .",
    "for example , in order to accumulate half of the observed omlr with stellar mass loss requires 7 gyr , assuming that the o abundance of stars are 0.45 solar , the age of the galaxies is 13 gyr and using the mass loss rate from ciotti et al .",
    "therefore , most of the o from old sn ii may be lie beyond @xmath60 .",
    "with suzaku observations of the fornax cluster , the abundances of o , mg , si , s and fe of the icm up to 130kpc north and up to 60kpc south of ngc 1399 , and o , ne , mg and fe abundances of ngc 1404 were derived accurately .",
    "the fe abundances around ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 are about solar and drop to 0.5 solar in the icm .",
    "the elemental abundance ratios show common values around ngc 1399 , ngc 1404 , and the icm : si and s have similar abundances to fe and o / fe , ne / fe , mg / fe ratios are 0.50.7 solar in units of the solar ratio .",
    "the o , ne and mg abundances of ngc 1404 and the ngc 1399 region are consistent with the stellar metallicity of these galaxies .",
    "most of the fe around ngc 1399 , ngc 1404 and the icm should have been synthesized by sn ia . the abundance ratios of o / fe and si / fe in the gas are consistent with a mixture of sn ia ejecta of the w7 model and metal - poor galactic stars .",
    "values for the imlr and omlr are much smaller than in rich clusters , which indicates that most of the metals may be outside of the region we observed .",
    "the metal distribution of the icm may be used as a tracer of the history of the cluster .",
