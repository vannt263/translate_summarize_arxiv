    "( 1996 ; hereafter i96 ) found an extremely broad iron k@xmath0 emission line with a particularly prominent red wing , extending down to @xmath4 kev , during an extended observation with the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ asca _ ; see tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) .",
    "the peculiar line profile , measured during what has been dubbed a ` deep minimum ' ( or dm ) in the x - ray light curve , had much more emission in the red wing , and much less around the line rest energy ( @xmath5 kev ) , compared to the fe k@xmath0 profiles thus far measured for mcg @xmath16@xmath130@xmath115 and other agns ( e.g. tanaka _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , yaqoob _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , nandra _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . also , the equivalent width of the line was unusually large , of the order of @xmath6 kev , a factor of @xmath7 larger than most such measurements of broad iron k lines in seyfert 1 galaxies . for the dm state of mcg @xmath16@xmath130@xmath115",
    ", i96 rejected the standard model for the fe - k@xmath0 line profile ( e.g. see fabian _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) , in which the line is emitted in an accretion disk rotating about a schwarzschild black hole , with the inner disk extending no closer than the radius for marginally stable orbits , ( i.e. 6 gravitational radii , or @xmath8 ) . instead",
    ", the extreme gravitational redshifts implied by the bloated red wing of the line were explained either in terms of emission from inside the last stable orbit around a schwarzschild hole ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ) or emission in a disk rotating about a kerr black hole ( e.g. i96 ; dabrowski _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; bromley , miller & pariev 1998 ) . in the latter case",
    "the last stable orbit extends down to @xmath9 for a maximally rotating kerr black hole . in both cases ,",
    "the red wing of the line is accounted for by emission closer to the black hole event horizon , so the photons can experience the effects of very strong gravity , resulting in extremely large redshifts .",
    "we point out that in terms of fitting the dm data for mcg @xmath16@xmath130@xmath115 with the standard model ( schwarzschild hole , disk extending to @xmath8 ) and the kerr model ( disk extending to @xmath10 ) , the largest difference in the fitting statistic , @xmath11 , is 6.2 for the same number of free model parameters ( see rows 1 and 3 in table 3 of i96 who assume a disk inclination of 30@xmath12 and an outer radius of @xmath13 ) .",
    "while this may be interpreted as being formally statistically significant , _ asca _ spectral fits do not in general ( and in this case , in particular ) include the effects of systematic errors which could reduce the overall significance of the result .",
    "since the implications of really being able to observe x - rays inside of @xmath8 and even closer to a black hole event horizon are so far reaching ( e.g. see fabian 1997 ) it is important to investigate the robustness of the result for mcg @xmath16@xmath130@xmath115 , the only case thus far reported .",
    "_ asca _ observed mcg @xmath16@xmath130@xmath115 for over 4 days starting 1994 , july 23 . _",
    "asca _ has four identical , thin - foil , light - weight x - ray telescopes ( xrt ) which focus x - rays onto one of two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) or one of two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis , see ohashi _ et al .",
    "see tanaka _",
    "( 1994 ) for a summary of the _ asca _ mission and focal - plane detectors .",
    "the sis sensors , each one consisting of four ccd ( charge coupled device ) chips were operated in a mode in which only one chip was exposed ( 1-ccd mode ) and the data were accumulated in faint mode .",
    "hereafter the two sis sensors are referred to as sis0 and sis1 and the two gis sensors as gis2 and gis3 .",
    "the data reduction and selection criteria are similar to those described in yaqoob _",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "the lightcurve of the entire observation has been presented elsewhere ( i96 ; reynolds _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; yaqoob _ et al .",
    "we use exactly the same time intervals defined by i96 to extract spectra of the dm state ( interval @xmath14 in their figure 2 ) and the flare state ( interval @xmath15 ) , as well as the average ( total ) spectrum . for the dm",
    ", we obtained @xmath16 kev count rates in the range 0.13 to 0.16 counts s@xmath17 and exposure times in the range 13.2 to 13.3 ks for the four instruments .",
    "figure 1 shows the ratio of the data in the dm to the best - fitting power - law model ( @xmath18 = 1.92 , @xmath19 = @xmath20 @xmath21 ) using data only in the energy ranges @xmath22 kev and @xmath23 kev .",
    "the excess above the underlying power - law is due to the fe - k@xmath0 line emission .",
    "as pointed out by i96 , the emission on the blue side of the line is unusually diminished compared to the red side .",
    "the portion of the lightcurve containing the dm state is shown in figure 2 .",
    "using data between 3 and 10 kev from all four instruments , we fitted the fe - k@xmath0 line for the average , flare and dm spectra with our ` baseline ' model in which the line photons are emitted in a disk rotating around a central schwarzschild black hole ( e.g. , fabian _ et al .",
    "the parameters are @xmath24 ( inclination angle of the disk normal relative to the observer ) , @xmath25 ( inner disk radius ) , @xmath26 ( outer disk radius ) , @xmath27 ( power - law index characterizing the line emissivity as @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 ( line intensity ) , and @xmath30 ( line energy in the disk rest frame ) .",
    "the inner radius , @xmath25 , was fixed at @xmath8 where @xmath31 ( i.e. the last stable orbit ) .",
    "there is interplay between @xmath30 and the other line parameters , so @xmath30 was fixed at 6.4 kev in the rest frame , corresponding to fluorescence in a cold disk .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 , models sh1 , sh2 , and sh3 .",
    "we repeated the above fitting , but this time replacing the schwarzschild black hole with a maximally rotating kerr black hole ( see e.g. , laor 1991 ) .",
    "now the inner radius is fixed at @xmath10 , the minimum value , or last stable orbit for the kerr metric .",
    "the spectral fit was repeated with @xmath30 fixed at 6.7 kev ( corresponding to he - like fe ) . for the average and flare spectra ,",
    "a kerr profile does not improve the fit , but for the dm , the kerr model provides a statistically better fit than the schwarzschild model ( @xmath32 ) . the results for the dm are shown in table 1 , models kr1 and kr2 .",
    "the basic reason why the fe - k@xmath0 line during the dm is better described by emission from matter closer than @xmath8 is that the observed strength of the blue peak of the line is too small for the observed strength of the red wing .",
    "this is compensated by the extra gravitational redshifts obtained by placing the emitter closer to the black hole , increasing the intensity of the red wing relative to the blue .",
    "our results confirm those of i96 , although the best - fitting parameters differ slightly because we fix @xmath27 at 2.5 and allow @xmath24 and @xmath26 to be free , the contrary to their technique .",
    "we tested whether we could fit the dm fe - k@xmath0 line profile without placing line - emitting matter closer to the black hole than @xmath33 by obscuring part of the standard schwarzschild disk with optically - thick matter .",
    "figure 3 illustrates how different parts of a schwarzschild disk affect the doppler and gravitational shift of line photons . defining @xmath34 ( including both doppler and gravitational effects ) , the shaded part labeled blue corresponds to @xmath35 and",
    "the shaded part labeled red corresponds to @xmath36 . in our simple - minded model ,",
    "the occultation of the disk is in the form of a strip running along the @xmath37 or @xmath38 directions , with half - width @xmath39 or @xmath40 respectively , passing symmetrically over the center of the disk .",
    "thus , line emission from either @xmath41 or @xmath42 is blocked from view and the predicted line profiles for the two cases are shown in figures 4a and 4b respectively ( for several values of the half - width ) .",
    "we use this model as a hypothesis , since we do not know the geometry of the optically - thick clouds ( there are plenty of arguments for their existence , e.g. guilbert & rees 1988 ) .",
    "the clouds could be spherical , filament - shaped , or neither .",
    "our simple model in some sense mimics an optically - thick cloud , whatever its shape , moving over the disk , resulting in some kind of average line profile .",
    "clearly , the profiles in figure 4a , in which much of the blueshifted emission is obscured , are relevant for the dm data .    for the spectral fits with the obscuration model , we fix @xmath43 kev and @xmath44 as before , and @xmath45 from the schwarzschild fit ( table 1 , sh3 ) .",
    "the best - fitting parameters are shown in table 1 , model oc1 .",
    "this fit is marginally better than the kerr model with @xmath46 kev ( model kr1 ) and marginally worse than the kerr model with @xmath47 kev ( model kr2 ) and so we conclude that the occulted , schwarzschild disk - line model describes the spectrum during the dm just as well as the standard kerr model .",
    "the above fits include only galactic absorption because we assume that there is no significant absorption from the ` warm absorber ' present above 3 kev that will affect the shape of the continuum ( fabian _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; reynolds _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; otani _ et al .",
    "this was also the assumption made by i96 and is based on observations of the warm absorber in mcg@xmath16 - 30 - 15 in higher flux states .",
    "however , if absorption were present , this could also affect measurements of the fe - k@xmath0 line .",
    "figure 5 shows the data / model ratio when the dm spectrum is fitted with galactic absorption and a power law with the best - fitting photon index of the average spectrum ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the deficiency of low - energy photons due to the ionized absorber is significant , even _ above _ 3 kev , and implies that the flattening of the continuum in the dm ( table 1 , models sh3 , kr1 , kr2 , oc1 ) is due to absorption .",
    "thus , the _ intrinsic _ spectral slope during the dm is not required to change .",
    "we therefore fitted the dm spectrum again with the occultation - line model with @xmath18 fixed at the average value of @xmath48 , but with free absorption ( table 1 , model oc2 ) .",
    "the number of free parameters is the same as before , but @xmath49 compared to the best - fitting kerr model ( model kr2 ) .",
    "the occultation description of the dm is thus as viable as the scenarios posited by i96 , reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) , dabrowski _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) , and bromley _",
    "we have examined the fe - k@xmath0 line profile during the deep minimum ( dm ) flux state for mcg@xmath16 - 30 - 15 with an ` occultation model ' in which the continuum source and much of the blueshifted part of the emission from the disk is obscured by an optically - thick cloud .",
    "this model describes the observed line profile as well as the kerr black - hole / disk model , but does not require emission from inside @xmath50 ( the last stable orbit for a schwarzschild black hole ) .",
    "one difficulty with the kerr interpretation proposed by i96 and others is that it does nt explain why kerr effects should only manifest themselves in the dm .",
    "the occultation model does not suffer from this problem .",
    "also , the line intensity is _ not _ required to increase relative to the average line intensity , as has been previously claimed .",
    "nor is the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe - k line during the dm required to be unusually large .",
    "we obtain @xmath51 ev for the dm _ and _ flare - states , and @xmath52 ev for the average line .",
    "in addition to the optically - thick obscurer that blocks most of the continuum region , the data above 3 kev are affected by the o viii edge of the warm absorber that becomes stronger in the low - flux state ( otani _ et al .",
    "we measure an additional column density of @xmath53 @xmath21 in the dm , which is a factor of @xmath54 increase compared to the high flux state ( fabian _ et al .",
    "the increase in column density is consistent with a picture in which the material that is photoionized by the central source becomes less opaque to soft x - rays due to a reduction in ionization when the continuum is blocked .",
    "note that the extra absorption we directly measure is _ not _ necessarily related to the optically - thick clouds responsible for obscuring the fe - k@xmath0 line emission .    to conclude , we have shown that the unusual fe - k@xmath0 line profile in mcg @xmath16@xmath130@xmath115 during a deep minimum in intensity does not necessarily require line emission from within @xmath33 and that the data are not adequate enough to distinguish between the schwarzschild and kerr solutions .",
    "( 1998 ) have also made the suggestion that a kerr black hole is not required , proposing that the true shape of the fe - k@xmath0 line is a double gaussian , but offer no physical model .",
    "we have shown that the deep - minimum line profile can be explained by occultation of a standard schwarzschild disk .",
    "this model is consistent with the detailed temporal profile of the continuum intensity dip .",
    "our results serve to highlight the hazards of over - interpreting observational results which have low statistical significance , to the extent that theoretical implications can become generally accepted when the data do not provide a strong case for them .",
