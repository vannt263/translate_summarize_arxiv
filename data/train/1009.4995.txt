    "the probability of this event is @xmath41 .",
    "we have to check that @xmath41 does not exceed @xmath42 multiplied by the product of @xmath43 factors for all neighbor events ( where @xmath44 is the size of the support of the corresponding events ) .",
    "this product can be split into parts according to possible intersection points .",
    "( if there are several intersection points , let us select and fix one of them . )",
    "then for any @xmath13 and for any @xmath44 there is at most @xmath45 factors that belong to the @xmath16-part and have size @xmath44 , since there exist at most @xmath45 objects that have complexity less than @xmath46 ( relative to  @xmath16 ) . then we take a product over all @xmath44 and multiply the results for all @xmath16 ( there are @xmath40 of them ) .",

    "( end of proof )    the inequality established in this theorem has an useful corollary : @xmath51 since @xmath52 .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 is an interval , then @xmath53 is @xmath54 , so this term ( as well as an additive constant @xmath55 ) can be absorbed by a small change in @xmath10 and we obtain the following corollary ( `` levin s lemma '' , see  @xcite for a discussion and further references ) : for any @xmath56 there exists a sequence @xmath7 such that all its substrings of sufficiently large length @xmath40 have complexity at least @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 be a string over some alphabet , and let @xmath59 be its prefix .",

    "exponent_. a _",
    "critical exponent _ of an infinite sequnce @xmath7 is the least upper bound of all exponents of fractional powers that are substrings of @xmath7 .",
    "d.  krieger and j.  shallit  @xcite have proved the following result :    for any real @xmath62 there exists an infinite sequence that has critical exponent  @xmath63 .    informally speaking ,",
    "when constructing such a sequence , we need to achieve two goals .",
    "first , we have to guarantee ( for rational numbers @xmath64 less than @xmath63 but arbitrarily close to  @xmath63 ) that our sequence contains @xmath64-powers ; second , we have to guarantee that it does not contain @xmath65-powers for @xmath66 .",
    "each goal is easy to achieve when considered separately .",
    "for the first one , we can just insert some @xmath64-power for every rational @xmath67 . for the second goal we can use the sequence with complex substrings : since every @xmath65-power has complexity about @xmath68 of its length ( the number of free bits in it ) , levin s sequence does not contain long @xmath65-powers if @xmath69 .",
    "the real problem is to combine these two goals : after we fix the repetition pattern needed to ensure the first requirement ( i.e. , after decide which bits in a sequence should coincide ) we need to choose the values of the `` free '' bits in such a way that no other ( significant ) repetitions arise .",
    "for that , let us first prove some general statement about kolmogorov complexity of subsequences in the case when some bits are repeated .",
    "let @xmath70 be an equivalence relation on @xmath71 .",
    "we assume that all equivalence classes are finite and the relation itself is computable ; moreover , we assume that for a given @xmath72 one can effectively list the @xmath72 s equivalence class .",
    "this relation is used as a repetition pattern : we consider only sequences @xmath7 that follows @xmath70 , i.e. , only sequences @xmath7 such that @xmath73 if @xmath74 . for any set @xmath75",
    "we consider the _ number of free bits in @xmath8 _ ,",
    "i.e. , the number of equivalence classes that have a non - empty intersection with  @xmath8 ; it is denoted @xmath76 in the sequel .    there are countably many equivalence classes .",
    "let us assign natural numbers to them ( say , in the increasing order of minimal elements ) and let @xmath77 be the number of equivalence class that contains  @xmath18 . then every sequence @xmath7 that follows the repetition pattern @xmath70 has the form @xmath78 for some function @xmath79 .",
    "now we assume that the equivalence relation @xmath70 ( as explained above ) and a constant @xmath56 are fixed .",
    "[ subsequence2 ] there exists a sequence @xmath7 that follows the pattern  @xmath70 and an integer @xmath11 with the following properties : for every finite set @xmath8 with @xmath80 there exists @xmath13 such that @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the `` multiplicity '' of @xmath16 , i.e. , the number of bits in its equivalence class .",
    "( note that if all equivalence classes are singletons , then @xmath83 disappears , @xmath76 is the cardinality of @xmath8 and we get an already mentioned corollary . )",
    "* proof*. let @xmath78 where @xmath84 is a sequence that satisfies the statement of theorem  [ subsequence1 ] ( with the same  @xmath10 ) .",
    "for any @xmath8 let @xmath85 be the set of all @xmath77 for @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath86 .",
    "theorem  [ subsequence1 ] guarantees that @xmath87 for some @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath89 , there exists some @xmath13 such that @xmath90 . to specify @xmath16 when @xmath91 is known , we need @xmath92 bits , so @xmath93 .",
    "after @xmath16 is known , we need @xmath53 additional bits to specify @xmath8 and @xmath94 bits to specify @xmath3 . knowing @xmath8 and @xmath3 ,",
    "we then reconstruct @xmath85 and @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , @xmath96 which implies the desired inequality ( with additional term @xmath55 , which can be compensated by a small change in  @xmath10 ) .",
    "assume that @xmath97 . first , let us show that theorem  [ subsequence2 ] implies the existence of a binary sequence @xmath7 that contains fractional powers of all rational exponents less than @xmath63 , but does not contain long fractional powers of exponents greater than @xmath34 .    to construct such a sequence ,",
    "let @xmath98 be all rational numbers between @xmath0 and @xmath63 . for each @xmath99",
    "we `` implant '' a fractional power of exponent @xmath100 in the sequence : we select some interval of length @xmath101 and decide that this interval should be a fractional power of some string of length @xmath102 ( and exponent @xmath100 ) .",
    "this means that we declare two indices in this interval equivalent if they differ by a multiple of @xmath102 .",
    "( the intervals for different @xmath18 are disjoint . )",
    "we call these intervals _ active intervals_. we assume that distance between two active intervals is much bigger than the lengths of these two intervals ( see below why this is useful ) .     and @xmath103 are implanted ; @xmath104 is a prefix of @xmath105 ( in this example the exponents are less than @xmath106 , so only one full period is shown ) . ]    evidently , any sequence that follows this repetition pattern has critical exponent at least @xmath63 .",
    "let us choose some @xmath10 between @xmath107 and @xmath0 and apply theorem  [ subsequence2 ] with this @xmath10 to the pattern explained above .",
    "we get a bit sequence ; let us prove that it does not contain _ long _ fractional powers of exponent greater than  @xmath34 . indeed , it is easy to see that density of free bits in this pattern is at least @xmath108 , i.e. , for any interval @xmath8 of length @xmath109 the number of free bits in it , @xmath110 , is at least @xmath111 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath8 intersects with two or more active intervals , then all bits between them are free , and the distance between the intervals is large compared to interval sizes .",
    "then we may assume that @xmath8 intersects with only one active interval .",
    "all subintervals of the active interval have the same repetitions period , and the density of free bits is minimal when @xmath8 is maximal , i.e. , coincides with the entire active interval .",
    "the bits outside the active interval are free ( no equivalences ) , so they can only increase the fraction of free bits .",
    "on the other hand , a fractional power of exponent @xmath34 and length @xmath109 has complexity @xmath112 ( we specify the length of the string and @xmath113 bits that form the period ) . for long enough strings",
    "we then get a contradiction with the statement of theorem  [ subsequence2 ] since @xmath114 .",
    "to get rid of short fractional powers of exponent greater than  @xmath34 we can add additional layer of symbols that prevents them .",
    "in other terms , consider a sequence in a finite alphabet that follows ( almost ) the same repetition pattern but has no other repetitions ( not prescribed by the pattern ) on short distances .",
    "it is easy to construct such a sequence ; for example , we may assume that @xmath102 is a multiple of @xmath115 and then consider a periodic sequence with any large period @xmath116 ; it will destroy all periods that are not multiple of @xmath116 , i.e. , all short periods and only finitely many of @xmath102 ( the latter does not change the critical exponent ) .",
    "the cartesian product of these two sequences ( @xmath18th letter is a pair formed by @xmath18th letters of both sequences ) has critical exponent between @xmath63 and @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , we even get a stronger result :    [ sequence3 ] for any @xmath63 and @xmath34 such that @xmath117 there exist a sequence @xmath7 that has fractional powers of exponent @xmath64 for all @xmath67 but does not have approximate fractional powers of exponent @xmath34 or more : there exists some @xmath118 such that any substring of length @xmath40 is @xmath119-far from any fractional power in terms of hamming distance ( we need to change at least @xmath120 symbols of the sequence to get a fractional power of length  @xmath40 ) .",
    "indeed , a change of @xmath121-fraction bits in a sequence of length @xmath40 increases its complexity at most by @xmath122 where @xmath123 therefore , we need to change a constant fraction of bits to compensate for the difference in complexities ( between the lower bound guaranteed by theorem  [ subsequence2 ] and the upper bound due to approximate periodicity ) .",
    "( end of proof . )",
    "the same construction ( with some refinement ) can be used to get a sequence with given critical exponent .",
    "( this proof follows the suggestions of d.  krieger who informed the author about the problem and suggested to apply theorem  [ subsequence1 ] to it .",
    "see  @xcite for the original proof .",
    "author thanks d.  krieger for the explanations and both authors of  @xcite for the permission to cite their paper . )",
    "again , let us consider repetition pattern that guarantees all exponents less than @xmath63 and apply theorem  [ subsequence2 ] with some @xmath10 close to @xmath0 .",
    "this ( as we have seen ) prevents powers with exponents greater that @xmath124 ; the problem is how to get rid of intermediate exponents .    to do this , we should distinguish between two possibilities : ( a )  an unwanted power is an extension of the prescribed one ( has the same period that unexpectedly has more repetitions ) and ( b )  an unwanted power is not an extension .",
    "the first type of unwanted powers can be prevented by adding brackets around each active interval ( in a special layer : we take a cartesian product of the sequence and this layer ) .",
    "it remains to explain why unwanted repetitions of the second type do not exist ( for @xmath10 close enough to  @xmath0 ) .",
    "consider any fractional power with exponent greater than  @xmath63 .",
    "there are two possibilities :    ( 1 )  it intersect at least two active intervals .",
    "then it contains all free bits between these intervals , and ( since we assume that the distances are large compared to the length of intervals ) the density of free bits is close to @xmath0 , so exponent greater than @xmath63 is impossible .",
    "( 2 )  it intersects only one active interval .",
    "the same argument ( about density of free bits ) shows that if the endpoints of this fractional power deviate significantly from the endpoints of the active interval , then the density of free bits is significantly greater than @xmath125 and we again get a contradiction .",
    "therefore , taking @xmath10 close to @xmath0 we may guarantee that the distance between endpoints of fractional power and active interval is a small fraction of the length of the active interval .",
    "then we get _ two different periods _ in the intersection of fractional power and active interval .",
    "one ( `` old '' ) is inherited from the repetition pattern ; the second one ( `` new '' ) is due to the fact that we consider a fractional power .",
    "( the periods are different , otherwise we are in the case  ( 1 ) . )",
    "the period lengths are close to each other .",
    "indeed , if the new period is significantly longer , then the exponent is less than @xmath63 ; if the new period is significantly shorter , then the complexity bound decreases and we again get a contradiction .",
    "now note that two periods @xmath126 and @xmath127 in a string guarantee the period @xmath128 near the endpoints of this string ( at the distance equal to the difference between string length and minimal of these periods ) .",
    "therefore we get a period that is a small fraction of the string length at an interval whose length is a non - negligible fraction of the string length .",
    "this again significantly decreases the complexity of the string , and this contradicts the lower bound of the complexity .",
    "( end of the proof . )",
    "this proof uses some parameters that have to be chosen properly . for a given @xmath63",
    "we choose @xmath10 that is close enough to @xmath0 and makes the arguments about `` sufficiently small '' and `` significantly different '' things in the last paragraph valid for long strings .",
    "then we choose the repetition patterns where length of active intervals are multiples of factorials and the distances between them grow much faster than the lengths of active intervals .",
    "then we apply theorem  [ subsequence2 ] for this pattern . finally , we look at the length @xmath11 provided by this theorem and prevent all shorter periods by an additional layer .",
    "another layes is used for brackets .",
