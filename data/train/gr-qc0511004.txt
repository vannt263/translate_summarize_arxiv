    "braneworld cosmologies @xcite have attracted great attention from researchers in the last few years . in these cosmological models ,",
    "the ordinary matter is confined to a three dimensional space called the brane , embedded in a larger space called the bulk in which only gravity can propagate .",
    "cosmologies with extra dimensions were proposed in order to solve the hierarchy problem , that is to explain why the gravity scale is sixteen orders of magnitude greater than the electro - weak scale , and are motivated by recent developments of string theory , known as m - theory .",
    "the study of black holes on the brane is rather difficult because of the confinement of matter on the brane whereas the gravitational field can access to the bulk .",
    "the full five dimensional bulk field equations have no known exact solutions representing static and spherically symmetric black holes with horizon on the brane . instead , several braneworld black hole solutions have been found based on different projections on the brane of the five dimensional weyl tensor .",
    "+ since the publication of the paper of virbhadra and ellis @xcite there has been a growing interest in the study of lensing by black holes .",
    "they analyzed numerically a schwarzschild black hole at the galactic center acting as a gravitational lens .",
    "for black hole gravitational lenses , large deflection angles are possible for photons passing close to the photon sphere .",
    "these photons could even make one or more complete turns , in both directions of rotation , around the black hole before eventually reaching an observer . as a consequence , two infinite sequences of images , called relativistic images ,",
    "are formed at each side of the black hole . instead of making a full numerical treatment , a logarithmic approximation of the deflection angle can be done to obtain the relativistic images .",
    "this approximation was first used by darwin @xcite for schwarzschild black holes , rediscovered and called the strong field limit by bozza _",
    "@xcite , extended to reissner  nordstrm geometries by eiroa _",
    "@xcite , and generalized to any spherically symmetric black hole by bozza @xcite .",
    "the strong field limit was subsequently applied to retrolensing by eiroa and torres @xcite and used by other authors in the analysis of different lensing scenarios .",
    "the study of gravitational lensing by braneworld black holes could be useful in the context of searching possible observational signatures of these objects .",
    "in fig . [ fig ] , three possible lensing situations are shown schematically . in the left , the black hole , which will be called the lens ( l ) ,",
    "is between the source ( s ) and the observer ( o ) ; in the middle , the source is between the lens and the observer ; and in the right the observer is between the source and the lens .",
    "the first case will be called standard lensing and the other two , respectively , cases i and ii of retrolensing .",
    "the observer - source , observer - lens and the lens - source distances , here taken much greater than the horizon radius @xmath0 , are , in units of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . defining @xmath4 as the angular position of the point source and @xmath5 as the angular position of the images ( i ) ,",

    "* strong field limit : @xmath18 diverges when @xmath19 , and for @xmath20 , it can be approximated by a logarithmic function @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constants .",
    "the weak field limit is used for small deflection angles , as it happens when the lens is a star , a galaxy , or for the weak field images produced by photons with large impact parameters in the case of black holes .",
    "the strong field limit is useful to make an approximate analytical treatment of the relativistic images for black hole lenses .",
    "+ the closest approach distance @xmath13 is related with the impact parameter @xmath24 ( in units of the horizon radius ) by the equation @xmath25 @xcite , and from the lens geometry @xmath26 , so @xmath13 can be calculated as a function of @xmath5 . by putting @xmath27 in eq .",

    "in this section , a five dimensional schwarzschild black hole is studied as gravitational lens in the context of braneworlds .",
    "the cosmological model adopted is randall - sundrum type ii @xcite , which consist of a positive tension brane in a one extra - dimensional bulk with negative cosmological constant . for this black hole ,",

    "have a lower evaporation rate by hawking radiation than their four dimensional counterparts in standard cosmology , and they could have survived up to present times . * only energies of about @xmath37 tev are needed to produce black holes by particle collisions instead of energy scales about @xmath38 tev required if no extra dimensions are present . these small size black holes could be created in the next generation particle accelerators or detected in cosmic rays .",

    "this metric has several differences to the standard schwarzschild geometry ; the horizon is singular ( except when @xmath94 , for which is just the standard schwarzschild solution in isotropic coordinates ) , and the area function has a turning point at @xmath95 , that can be either inside or outside the horizon .",
    "another difference , coming from that @xmath96 , is that the adm mass and the gravitational mass ( defined by @xmath97 ) are not the same .",
    "the photon sphere has radius : @xmath98 the coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the metric `` u=0 '' are plotted in fig . 3 of ref .",

    "[ 5dschw ] , can be applied to massive astrophysical black holes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the case of the supermassive black hole in the galactic center was analyzed and the results for the two geometries described above were compared with those corresponding to the standard four dimensional schwarzschild black hole . + another related work , using the arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali braneworld model , is that by frolov _",
    "they found the induced metric on the brane by a schwarzschild black hole moving in the bulk , and also studied the deflection of light on the brane produced by the black hole .",
    "the relativistic images produced by black hole lenses have an angular position about the size of the angle subtended by the photon sphere and they are strongly demagnified , making their observation extremely difficult . in astrophysical scenarios ,",
    "the observation of these relativistic images is not possible today and it will be a challenge for the next decade .",
    "whisker @xcite have shown that a braneworld black hole in the center of our galaxy could have different observational signatures than the four dimensional schwarzschild one . in the case of small size black holes studied as gravitational lenses by eiroa @xcite",
    ", the observation of the relativistic images in astrophysical contexts will be even more difficult .",
    "but if the braneworld model is correct and these black holes can be produced by next generation of particle accelerators or in cosmic ray showers , it opens up the possibility of observing the phenomena of lensing by black holes in the laboratory .",
