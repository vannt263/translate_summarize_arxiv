    "<S> the highest efficiency occurs for @xmath62 and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this larger value of the efficiency is the result of a slightly enhanced coupling ( overlap ) between sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 that results from shifting site @xmath3 to a lower ( local ) energy . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , the phonon antennae principle is closely related to the hartmann - hahn condition @xcite which is of considerable importance in sensing devices . here </S>",
    "<S> the challenge is that the sensor , e.g. an electron spin , may not be resonant with an external system generating a signal ( e.g. a different electron or nuclear spin ) . </S>",
    "<S> this problem may be overcome by continuous driving of the electron spin in the sensor at a strength that leads to a splitting of dressed states that matches the externally generated signal and thus permits a strong response of the sensor ( transitions between upper and lower dressed state ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a further example in which tuning is not achieved by driving is the recently proposed theory that olfaction ( our sense of smell ) is explained , at least partially , as originating from phonon assisted electron transport where electron source and drain in the receptor are separated by an energy splitting that is matched to a specific vibrational frequency of an odorant molecule . </S>",

    "<S> other considerations , such as structural stability and steric constraints imposed by the need to integrate the structure into the cellular environment are likely to drive the supramolecular structure of ppcs , however the multiplicity of local maxima we find _ does _ provide the opportunity to find an optimal working point for transport in the _ vicinity _ of a structure arising from these other factors . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that the fmo complex parameters correspond to a local maximum of the @xmath85 pathways efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , changes in temperature will also alter the inter - exciton energy that maximises the relaxation rates in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rate ] ) , and an evolving or adaptive system might be able to change its coupling structure to maintain the inter - exciton energy differences at the maximum of the thermal noise strength .    </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that while the redfield formalism allows us to give a physically clear description of the essential phonon antenna mechanism , the use of markovian redfield theory for ppc problems neglects a number of important dynamical effects ( environmental memory , stokes shift , discrete modes in the spectral function ) which are crucial for understanding the _ persistence _ of inter - eigenstate coherence that is generated in experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these effects have been neglected here for simplicity , but exploring these effects in the context of the phonon antenna mechanism could lead to an even more sophisticated principle , involving transient , broad - band sampling of the spectral function and evolving exciton spectra and localisation lengths which could , potentially , activate or deactivate relaxation pathways dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the concept of using coherent interactions to alter the sampling of a ( fixed ) environmental spectral function could be readily achieved in a variety of atomic and condensed matter systems @xcite , and could also be used as a sensitive probe for measuring spectral functions by measuring transport rates as functions of a controllable coupling parameter .    _ </S>",
