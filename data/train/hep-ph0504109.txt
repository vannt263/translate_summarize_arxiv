    "we have presented in detail the calculation of @xmath14 radiative corrections to the pair production of charginos and neutralinos within the minimal supersymmetric standard model . we discussed a possible separation of weak and qed corrections .",
    "although only the sum of virtual and real bremsstrahlung corrections have physical meaning , a separation of these two contributions has its advantages .",
    "the qed corrections are treated numerically by integration over the phase space with an additional photon in the final state .",
    "quite often a cancellation between qed and weak corrections occurs leading to a small total correction .",
    "furthermore , we used the structure function formalism to include higher order qed corrections and to split the qed corrections into a universal and a non - universal part .",
    "the non - universal qed corrections contain the integration over the three particle final state and are in the case of the total cross - section often negligible .",
    "the numerical analysis is based on the sps1a benchmark scenario , proposed within the spa project .",
    "the @xmath2 parameters of the spa convention are translated into a set of on - shell parameters , which serve as input for our on - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "such translation tools make it possible to compare cross sections , masses , etc . calculated in different renormalization schemes .",
    "the presented numerics shows results for the total cross - section , left - right , and forward - backward asymmetries . in all three cases we have sizeable radiative corrections around the 10% and in some cases even higher .",
    "we thank for useful correspondence with w.  porod and t.  fritzsche .",
