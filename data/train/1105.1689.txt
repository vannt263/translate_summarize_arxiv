    "it was therefore notable when ( * ? ? ? * hereafter z+06 ) reported that six bal quasars from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite were `` polar '' , constrained by radio flux density variability to lie within 35@xmath0 of a relativistic jet ( presumably located at 90@xmath0 latitude above the accretion disk ) .",

    "the timescale for the electrons producing the radio synchrotron emission to lose all their energy through inverse compton scattering of ambient radio photons decreases to just a few days , and the brightness temperature falls back below @xmath1k @xcite .",

    "relativistic motion of the radio - emitting plasma in our direction , e.g. in a relativistic jet oriented close to our line of sight , will boost the flux and brightness temperature we infer @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperature is related to the surface brightness ; therefore , a sufficiently large change in the surface brightness of a radio source indicates an emission component with a brightness temperature @xmath4k and doppler boosting in our direction .    as knowledge of the incidence of bals as a function of latitude",
    "would be a useful constraint on models of bal outflows , close analysis of the assumptions leading to the designation of some bal quasars as `` polar '' is worthwhile .",
    "we present a brief such analysis in  [ analysis ] .",

    "we report the date of each epoch as a modified julian date ( mjd ) . for mrk  231 , we include on a second row the data of @xcite .",
    "a word about nvss flux densities is in order .",
    "z+06 used integrated flux densities to be conservative in selecting variable objects which were brighter in the first survey .",
    "gp07 used peak flux densities to obtain a more accurate measurement of the variable radio flux density given the different resolutions of the two surveys .",

    "to explain these quasars using emission from plasma with @xmath24k at both epochs requires reasonable minimum radii . however , we must also determine whether the required expansion between the two epochs is reasonable .",

    "the values of @xmath52 are large but physically possible .    however , the values of @xmath55 in table 1 are for uniform planar expansion in all directions in the plane of the sky .",

    "leaving out cases of contraction , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , we find minimum opening angles of @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "such values are larger than those seen in quasars with comparable radio luminosities , although they are similar to those found in weak radio galaxies @xcite",
    ". therefore , expansion close to the plane of the sky seems an unlikely explanation for the observed flux variability in these quasars , even though it is physically possible .",

    "such roughly spherical , expanding blobs of magnetized plasma could be launched by a relativistic jet close to the plane of the sky in these objects .",
    "light travel time effects explain why a spherical emission source which is observed to expand between time @xmath76 to @xmath77 in our frame ( time @xmath76 to @xmath78 in the quasar frame ) can appear to cover a larger area than @xmath79 , where we take @xmath80 for simplicity in this example .",
    "consider the light from such a source which reaches us at time @xmath81 in our frame : not all of it was emitted at time @xmath82 in the quasar frame .",
    "some of that light was emitted after time @xmath82 in the quasar frame from material which had travelled toward us and decreased the light - travel time to reach us from it , thus affording us a glimpse of a larger emitting source after a given observed time interval than in the case of expansion solely in the plane of the sky .",
    "the only requirement for that to happen is that the emitting source must expand for a time @xmath83 in the quasar frame to be seen to expand to an area @xmath84 over time @xmath81 in the observer frame .",
    "( to see this , note that the part of the sphere which yields the largest apparent transverse motion is that located at an angle @xmath85 to our line of sight . during a time @xmath70 in the quasar frame ,",

    "_ in fact , the above equation is an underestimate for a source expanding with @xmath98 because it does not account for all relativistic effects , such as doppler boosting in the part of the source expanding toward us .",
    "full accounting of such effects in a source whose outer edge expands with velocity @xmath95 shows that @xmath99 ( eq . ( 8) of @xcite ) in the first phase of the expansion . even for nonrelativistic expansion because the source is assumed to be initially synchrotron self - absorbed at @xmath100 , so that the intensity of the emission at that frequency increases as the magnetic field weakens in the expanding plasma ; see eq .",

    "as the source starts to become optically thin to synchrotron self - absorption , @xmath101 peaks and then declines , initially roughly as @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "therefore , _ extremely large flux density decreases can also be reproduced with @xmath96 close to 1 without an intrinsic @xmath97k . _    to compute the required @xmath96 values , we compare to z+06 and gp07 , who in effect assumed @xmath103=@xmath61 in eq .",

    "the minimum @xmath96 required for spherical expansion to explain the observed flux increases in these quasars depends on whether the source responsible for the flux increase is pre - existing or new . in the former case ,",
    "the required @xmath96 is close to @xmath55 except that it never exceeds unity . in the latter case ,",
    "the required @xmath96 can differ considerably from @xmath55 .",

    "values of @xmath109 are given in table 1 for all cases where @xmath120k .",

    "values of up to @xmath126 have been inferred for extragalactic jets @xcite , but whether such values occur in cases of spherical expansion of radio - emitting plasma is not clear .",
    "nonetheless , spherical expansion of an emitting source at @xmath109 or larger can explain all the radio variability in these objects while still maintaining an intrinsic @xmath24k .",
    "values of @xmath96 above the minimum required would allow for shorter episodes of variability to explain the same flux density changes , which eases the requirement on how long the source must expand and remain optically thick .",
    "larger values of @xmath96 could also maintain an intrinsic @xmath127k .",

    "those quasars appear to require the most extreme parameters to explain their variability without resorting to a jet directed close to our line of sight .",

    "furthermore , in the case of mrk 231 , if there is a jet oriented near our line of sight then the lack of apparent superluminal motion in the secondary vlbi component @xcite means must that it be a near - stationary shock in that jet . otherwise , the jet would need to be oriented at @xmath134 of our line of sight for the @xmath135 values considered in @xcite .",
    "such small angles are extremely unlikely _ a priori _",
    "( @xmath1360.12% chance if quasars are seen at all @xmath137 ) .",
    "they are also potentially ruled out in mrk 231 by the detection of a rotating nuclear gas disk producing velocity gradients on the sky of @xmath138110kms@xmath2  and @xmath13870kms@xmath2  in hi  @xcite and co @xcite at radii of @xmath13685@xmath139pc and @xmath136255@xmath139pc , respectively .",
    "such large observed gradients would imply unprecedentedly large intrinsic velocity gradients for @xmath134 , except in the case where the detected outer disk is misaligned with the innermost disk that sets the orientation of the jet ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly consider additional effects that might affect the likelihood of jets in these objects .",
    "varying the fiducial magnetic field in the radio - emitting region can not increase the limiting intrinsic @xmath11 .",
    "the model of @xcite which we have used does not include the additional surface brightness boost that would occur for a relativistically expanding sphere that was also moving toward us at a significant fraction of @xmath61 .",
    "however , the speed in our direction required to keep @xmath127k in j0756 + 3714 ( e.g. ) is 0.91@xmath61 ( for expansion at @xmath109 ) , which would require a relativistic jet oriented within @xmath140 of our line of sight . postulating two new radio - emitting regions , each responsible for half the observed flux increase , can reduce @xmath105 by a factor of two at most .",
    "that could be significant for j0756 + 3714 , mrk 231 or j1346 + 3924 , given the large uncertainties on their inferred brightness temperatures , but not for j0828 + 3718 .",
    "overall , j0828 + 3718 is the best candidate for a true polar bal quasar .",
    "of the twenty - two candidate polar bal quasars previously reported in the literature , only sixteen have statistically significant variability . those sixteen",
    "can be explained without requiring @xmath97k , either by expansion of a pre - existing source at velocities of a few tenths of lightspeed in most cases , or by a newly appeared spherical emitting source expanding at a lower limit @xmath109 of @xmath141 or greater . to ensure @xmath127k",
    "would require larger velocities , but only in one or two cases would the required velocity be unprecedentedly large .",
    "although a relativistic jet oriented close to our line of sight is not required to explain the observed flux variability in any of these quasars , we have not ruled out such a jet in any of them .",
    "( however , note that a further observation of the candidate polar bal quasar sdss j025625.56@xmath90011912.1 by @xcite did not reveal the continued variability which is expected if a relativistic jet is oriented along our line of sight to that object . )",
    "as two - epoch flux density variability is unable to unambiguously identify cases of doppler boosting , determining the relative incidence of relativistic jets oriented along our line of sight in normal and bal quasars will require vlbi imaging to directly measure brightness temperatures . in cases with @xmath97k , repeated imaging will be required to determine whether such @xmath11 values are temporary ( due to beaming from relativistic expansion of plasma structures in intermittent flares ) or persistent ( due to jet beaming ) and to constrain apparent transverse jet velocities in the latter case .",
