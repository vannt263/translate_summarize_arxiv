    "this is a large gap relative to other sn  i , though similar to sn  2004aw @xcite ; it is caused by metal - line absorption from heavy elements in the outer layers of the ejecta , as is evident from spectra taken after august 1 .",

    "spectroscopically , ptf12gzk exhibits high expansion velocities , @xmath2kms@xmath3 ( si  ii absorption velocity ) .",
    "other sne  ic with similar velocities are broad - lined sne  ic ( figure 4 ) , some of which are associated with grbs ( woosley & bloom 2006 , and references within ) , while no such association was determined for ptf12gzk ( see also sn 2009bb ; soderberg et al .",
    "most similar is sn 2003lw , a sn associated with a grb @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation is a burst misaligned with our line of sight , or a failed grb .",
    "such a scenario is further supported by the host - galaxy characteristics , resembling those of a broad - lined sn  ic host galaxy .",
    "we know of no typical sn  ic exploding in a host with similar luminosity and oxygen abundance .",
    "the observed relatively narrow lines give a dispersion of @xmath57 , compared to @xmath58 in the case of broad - lined sne  ic , and may suggest a nonspherical explosion geometry @xcite , or that the ejecta mass is high or has a very steep density gradient ( a discussion on the effects of a steep density gradient on the lc can be found in piro & nakar 2012 ) .",
    "late - time , nebular spectra will probe the geometry of the explosion in more detail .    from the si  ii line velocity at peak brightness of ptf12gzk ( 15,300kms@xmath3 from the august 12 spectrum ) and",

    "the derived ejecta mass is 7.5m@xmath4 ( 612m@xmath4 ) , pointing to a large initial progenitor mass of 2535m@xmath4 , though the latter values are highly uncertain @xcite .",
    "we derive a kinetic energy of @xmath64erg [ ( 510 ) @xmath65 erg ] . using @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "we get an estimated @xmath68ni mass of 0.37m@xmath4 ( scaling the ptf12gzk light curve to that of sn 2003dh ; mazzali et al . 2003 ) . using the @xmath69-band peak magnitude vs. nickel mass relation presented by perets et al . ( 2010 ) , we derive a @xmath68ni mass of 0.35m@xmath4 , in agreement with the results derived from the scaling relations .",
    "these physical properties , as well as the high expansion velocities and the host galaxy , are unlike those of normal sne  ic , which typically occur in large hosts and have low ejecta masses , and kinetic energies , ( 1.7m@xmath4 , and @xmath70erg drout et al .",

    "ptf12gzk is a remarkable example of a sn  ic in terms of expansion velocities , evolution timescale , the ejected mass , and the kinetic energy released in the explosion .",
