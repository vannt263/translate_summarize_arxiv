    "the general theory of qcd has been developed for more than 40 years , and at present , nobody ever doubts its validity .",
    "however , on the other side there is still not a reliable way to deal with the long - distance effects of qcd which are responsible for the quark confinement and hadronic transition matrix elements , because their evaluations can not be done in perturbative approach .",
    "thus , one needs to factorize the perturbative sub - processes and the non - perturbative parts which correspond to different energy scales .",
    "the perturbative parts are in principle , calculable to any order within the framework of quantum field theory , whereas the non - perturbative part must be evaluated by either fitting data while its universality is assumed , or invoking concrete models .",
    "the perturbative qcd method ( pqcd ) has been applied to study processes where transitions from heavy mesons or baryons to light hadrons are concerned @xcite , namely the pqcd which includes the sudakov resummation , is proved to be successful for handling processes with small 4-momentum transfer @xmath1 . indeed the processes involving heavy hadrons may provide us with an opportunity to study strong interaction , because compared to @xmath11 there exist natural energy scales ( heavy quark masses ) which can be used to factorize the perturbative contributions from the non - perturbative effects . on the other hand , for the processes involving heavy hadrons , at small recoil region , where @xmath12 is close to unity ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the four - velocities of the initial and final hadrons ) , i.e. the momentum transfer @xmath1 is sufficiently large , the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) works well due to an extra symmetry @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "therefore the hqet and pqcd seem to apply at different regions of @xmath1 . for a two - body decay ,",
    "the momentum transfer is fixed by the kinematics , however , for a three - body decay , @xmath1 would span the two different regions .    among all the processes , the semi - leptonic decay of hadrons plays an important role for probing the underlying principles and employed models because this process is relatively simple and less dependent on the non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "namely leptons do not participate in strong interaction , and there is no contamination from the crossed gluon - exchanges between quarks residing in different hadrons which are produced in the weak transitions , whereas such effects are important for the non - leptonic decays .",
    "thus one might gain more model - independent information , such as extraction of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements from data . in the semi - leptonic decays of heavy hadrons",
    "it is expected to factorize the perturbative and non - perturbative parts more naturally .",
    "recently the delphi collaboration reported their measurement on the @xmath8 decay form factor in the semi - leptonic process @xmath14 and determined the parameter @xmath15 in the isgur - wise function @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "there is a flood of papers to discuss the semi - leptonic decays of heavy mesons and the concerned factorization . by contraries ,",
    "the studies on heavy baryons are much behind @xcite , because baryons consist of three constituent quarks and their inner structures are much more complicated than mesons . in this work",
    ", we are going to employ the one - heavy - quark - one - light - diquark picture for the heavy @xmath8 and @xmath9 to evaluate the form factors of this semi - leptonic transition @xmath17 .",
    "even though the subject of diquark is still in dispute , it is commonly believed that the quark - diquark picture may be a plausible description of baryons @xcite , especially for the heavy baryons which possess one or two heavy quarks .",
    "the kinematic region for the semileptonic decay @xmath17 can be characterized by the quantity @xmath4 , which is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the four - momenta of @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "it is noted that this parameter @xmath4 which is commonly adopted in the pqcd approach is exactly the same as the recoil factor @xmath5 used in the hqet .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath1 in the process is within the range of @xmath20 , equivalently , it is @xmath21 . in the framework of the hqet @xcite",
    ", this process was investigated by some authors @xcite . for larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the hqet works well , whereas one can expect that for smaller @xmath1 , the pqcd approach applies .",
    "in this work , following ref.@xcite , we calculate the contribution from the region with small @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath22 , to the amplitude in pqcd .",
    "one believes that the pqcd makes better sense in this region .",
    "krner et al .",
    "discussed similar cases and suggested that the symmetry for smaller recoil is different from that for larger recoil , so they used the isgur - wise function to obtain the amplitude in the kinematic region of smaller recoil , but brodsky - lepage function for larger recoils @xcite .",
    "our strategy is similar that we apply the pqcd for small @xmath1 while apply hqet for large @xmath1 where the pqcd is no longer reliable , instead .    concretely , when integrating the amplitude square from minimum to maximum of @xmath1 to gain the decay rate , we divide the whole kinematic region into two parts , small and large @xmath1 ( @xmath4 , equivalently ) .",
    "we phenomenologically adopt a turning point at a certain @xmath4 value , to derive the form factors ( defined below in the text ) in terms of pqcd in the region from @xmath23 to this point and then beyond it we use the hqet instead @xcite .",
    "we let the two parts connect at the turning point . from ref .",
    "@xcite , we notice that as @xmath24 , the pqcd result is not reliable , so that we choose the turning point at vicinity of @xmath25 . to testify",
    "if the choice is reasonable , we slightly vary the values of the turning point as choosing @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 to see how sensitive the result is to the choice .",
    "moreover , it is noted that as @xmath3 and 1.15 are chosen , the two parts connect almost smoothly .",
    "even though , to make more sense , we adopt a proper numerical program to make the connection sufficiently smooth , namely we let not only the two parts connect , but also the derivatives from two sides are exactly equal . in fact , small differences in the derivatives are easily smeared out by the program .",
    "later in the text , we will explicitly show that the final result is not much sensitive to it , thus one can trust its validity .",
    "we name the scheme as the `` hybrid '' approach .",
    "we also parameterize the form factor with respect to @xmath4 based on our numerical results .",
    "in fact , when we integrate over the whole kinematic range of @xmath4 , we just use the parameterized expression .",
    "moreover , we not only reevaluate the form factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 of the exclusive process in the diquark picture , but also calculate the form factors @xmath31 and @xmath32 which were neglected in previous works @xcite .",
    "so far , the data on the @xmath8 semi - leptonic decay are only provided by the delphi collaboration @xcite and not rich enough to single out the contributions from @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "more accurate measurement in the future may offer information about them .",
    "our treatment has another advantage . in the pure pqcd approach",
    ", there is an end - point divergence at @xmath33 , even though it is mild and the decay rate which includes an integration over the phase space of final states , i.e. over @xmath4 , is finite . as calculating the contribution from the region with large @xmath1 (",
    "@xmath34 is not zero , @xmath4 can not be exactly 1 , thus the superficial singularity does not exist at all , but the form factors are obviously proportional to @xmath35 which has the singular property . ] to the form factors in terms of the hqet , the end - point divergence does not exist at all .",
    "we organize our paper as follows , in section ii , we derive the factorization formula for @xmath36 .",

    "obviously , the calculation in pqcd depends on the factor @xmath117 , which regularly must be obtained by fitting the data of semileptonic decays , so that the theoretical predictions are less meaningful . instead",

    "@xcite . according to the definitions given in eq.([gx ] ) , we re - calculate @xmath133 while dropping out @xmath134 and @xmath135 and also obtain similar conclusion that @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the same in amplitude , but opposite in sign , as shown in fig .",

    "therefore , to reconcile the two approaches which work in different @xmath4 regions , @xmath141 , we apply the hqet for small @xmath4 , but use pqcd for larger @xmath4 .",
    "our strategy is that we let the form factors @xmath121 , @xmath122 derived in the pqcd approach be equal to the value obtained in terms of hqet at the point @xmath10 .",
    "the numerical results of the form factor @xmath142 in the hybrid scheme are shown in fig.[t3 ] for three different @xmath143values : 1.05 , 1.10 and 1.15 , respectively .",
    "it is noted that for @xmath3 and 1.15 , the left- and right - derivatives are very close and the connection is smooth , whereas , as @xmath10 is chosen as 1.05 , a difference between the derivatives at the two sides of @xmath144 obviously manifests .",
    "we then adopt a proper numerical program to smoothen the curve , namely let the derivatives of the two sides meet each other for any @xmath140value near the cut point .",
    "fig.[t3 ] shows that such treatment in fact does not change the general form of the curve , but makes it sufficiently smooth for all @xmath4 values including the selected cut point @xmath10 .",
    "another advantage of adopting such a `` hybrid '' scheme is that there does not exist end - point singularity for the form factors at @xmath130 .",
    "since at the turning point , we let the form factors derived in terms of pqcd be connected with that obtained in hqet , the product @xmath145 is automatically determined by the connection . with the value , we calculate the form factors within the range of small @xmath1 in pqcd . in this hybrid scheme , one does not need to invoke the data on the semi - leptonic decay to fix the parameter @xmath145 at all .    by our numerical results obtained in the hybrid scheme",
    ", the form factors @xmath121 ( or @xmath146 ) can be parameterized in a satisfactory expression , here we only present the expression for @xmath147 as @xmath148 and similar parameterized form factors were discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the expression can be described by only one `` isger - wise function '' for the transition @xmath149 at the heavy quark limit , and it is done by the delphi collaboration based on their data on @xmath150 .",
    "it is parameterized as @xcite @xmath151 where @xmath152 .    obviously , this expression is only valid to the leading order , i.e. linearly proportional to @xmath153 where @xmath154 exactly corresponds to the parameter @xmath4 which is commonly adopted in the pqcd language .",
    "by contrast , our result includes higher power terms because the @xmath155 corrections are automatically taken into account in our work .",
    "it is noted that the coefficient of the linear term in our numerical result is reasonably consistent with the @xmath15 obtained by fitting data .    to obtain the total decay width ,",
    "we integrate over the whole range @xmath4 from 1 to @xmath23 , the integrand is the parameterized form factor in eq.([para ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath156 for a comparison , we present the results corresponding to other two @xmath10 values where the smoothing treatment is employed , and they are @xmath157    one can notice that the factor @xmath145 does not change much as @xmath10 varies and they are about 1.5 times larger than the value obtained in pure pqcd ( eq.([pqcd ] ) ) .",
    "when the turning point is chosen at @xmath144 , the branching ratio calculated in the hybrid scheme is very close to the result obtained in pure hqet , while for @xmath147 and @xmath158 , the resultant branching ratio is slightly larger than that obtained in pure hqet , but more coincides with the data .    in our scenario ,",
    "the hqet is applied for smaller @xmath4 , and the values of the form factors at @xmath10 are fixed by the theory .",
    "the values can also determine @xmath145 which will be used for the pqcd calculations for larger @xmath4 .",
    "the hqet is an ideal theoretical framework , but there is an unknown function which is fully governed by the non - perturbative qcd effects , that is the famous isgur - wise function",
    ". the function can be either obtained by fitting data , or evaluated by concrete models .",
    "various models would result in different slopes .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the drell - yan type overlap integrals to obtain the slope which is what we employed to get the parametrization eq.([para ] ) and the slope is @xmath159 .",
    "instead , the authors of @xcite evaluated the slope in the isgur - wise function by means of the qcd sum rules .",
    "according to their result , we re - parameterize the form factor @xmath160 and have @xmath161 correspondingly , we obtain @xmath162    the fitted slope by the delphi collaboration is @xmath152 @xcite , which is between the two theoretical evaluated values . in these references ,",
    "only linear term remained , due to uncertainties in the approximations the deviations are understandable .",
    "therefore , one can note that there is a model - dependence which mainly manifests in the slope of the isgur - wise function . even though they deviate from each other at the linear term , the high power terms would compensate the deviation slightly and the predicted values on the branching ratio in two approaches eqs.([para],[para1 ] ) are qualitatively consistent with data .",
    "there indeed is a byproduct which brings in an advantage that more accurate measurements can help to make judgement on validity of the models by which the isgur - wise functions are evaluated .    to make more sense , we purposely present the ratio @xmath163 obtained in the hybrid scheme in fig .",
    "[ t5 ] , it is noted that the ratio is qualitatively consistent with that given in ref .",
    "@xcite which was shown on the left part of fig . 3 of their paper @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite extended @xmath4 into the un - physical region ( @xmath164 for @xmath150 ) , while we only keep it within the physical region .",
    "it is noted that in the physical region , numerically our result is very close to that obtained in ref .",
    "but if one extends the curve to larger @xmath4 , he will notice that our curve is convex , but theirs is concave , namely the coefficient of the quadratic term has an opposite sign , but the difference is too tiny to be observed or bring up substantial difference for the evaluation of the decay width .",
    "in this work , we investigate the semi - leptonic decay @xmath165 in the so called `` hybrid scheme '' and the diquark picture for heavy baryons @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the hybrid scheme means that for the range of smaller @xmath1 ( larger @xmath140value ) we use the pqcd approach , whereas the hqet for larger @xmath1 ( near @xmath130 ) , to calculate the form factors .",
    "we find that the form factors @xmath124 and @xmath125 can be safely neglected as suggested in the literature .",
    "besides , we do not need to determine the phenomenological parameters @xmath166 and @xmath167 by fitting data in the hybrid scheme as one did with the pure pqcd approach .",
    "our result is generally consistent with the newly measured branching ratio @xmath0 within two standard deviations and the end - point singularities existing in the pqcd approach are completely avoided .",
    "in fact , the final result somehow depends on the slope in the isgur - wise function of the hqet , which is obtained by model - dependent theoretical calculations .",
    "therefore , we may only trust the obtained value to this accuracy , the further experimental data and development in theoretical framework will help to improve the accuracy of the theoretical predictions .",
    "the quark - diquark picture seems to work well for dealing with the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath8 , and we may expect that the quark - diquark picture indeed reflects the physical reality and is applicable to the processes where baryons are involved , at least for the heavy baryons @xcite",

    "<S> in this work we use the heavy - quark - light - diquark picture to study the semileptonic decay @xmath0 in the so - called hybrid scheme . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we apply the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) for larger @xmath1 ( corresponding to small recoil ) , which is the invariant mass square of @xmath2 , whereas the perturbative qcd approach for smaller @xmath1 to calculate the form factors . </S>",
    "<S> the turning point where we require the form factors derived in the two approaches to be connected , is chosen near @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that the kinematic parameter @xmath4 which is usually adopted in the perturbative qcd approach , is in fact exactly the same as the recoil factor @xmath5 used in hqet where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the four velocities of @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the final result is not much sensitive to the choice , so that it is relatively reliable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we apply a proper numerical program within a small range around @xmath10 to make the connection sufficiently smooth and we parameterize the form factor by fitting the curve gained in the hybrid scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the expression and involved parameters can be compared with the ones gained by fitting the experimental data . in this scheme </S>",
    "<S> the end - point singularities do not appear at all . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated value is satisfactorily consistent with the data which is recently measured by the delphi collaboration within two standard deviations . </S>"
