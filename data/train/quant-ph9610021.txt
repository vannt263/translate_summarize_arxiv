    "in particular , in a previous paper @xcite we derived the ladder - operator form the bs and on this basis we generalized the bs to the generalized bs which possessed the number and squeezed states as limits in the framework of lie algebra @xmath0 .    in the present paper we shall propose a one - parameter generalization of the binomial states , the _ hypergeometric states _",

    "we remark that in the case of @xmath26 , the hgs @xmath27 is @xmath21 independent and is equal to the binomial state @xmath28 .",
    "it is well known that the hypergeometric distribution tends to the binomial distribution in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "so , correspondingly , the hgs tends to the bs in this limit @xmath30 this fact can be verified directly .",
    "furthermore , the bs go to the number states and coherent states , the latter corresponds to the poisson distribution , in certain limits .",
    "so the hgs reduce to the number and coherent states in these limits : @xmath31    it is easy to show that the hgs are normalized by using the following identity @xmath32 which can be obtained by comparing the power series expansion of @xmath33 .      in a previous paper @xcite we have shown that the bs admit the ladder operator formulation , namely , they are characterized by the following eigenvalue equation @xmath34|m,\\eta\\rangle=     \\sqrt{\\eta}m|m,\\eta\\rangle , \\label{bseq}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the raising operator of the lie algebra @xmath0 via its holstein - primakoff realization .",

    "in this section we turn to the nonclassical properties of the hgs .      the mean photon number in the hgs is obtained as @xmath60 it is interesting that it is independent of @xmath21 and therefore it is exactly same as that of the bs . however , the mean value of @xmath61 depends on @xmath21 @xmath62 then the fluctuation of the photon number is @xmath63 where the @xmath64 is the corresponding fluctuation of the bs .",
    "we find that this fluctuation is always weaker than that of the bs since the factor @xmath65 is always smaller than 1 except for @xmath26 and the limit @xmath46 .",
    "let us go into some detail of the factor @xmath66 , which is referred to as the _ weakening factor_. we shall see that this factor lies between one half and 1 @xmath67 in fact , as a function of @xmath21 for fixed @xmath43 , @xmath66 is an increasing function and the smallest @xmath66 corresponds to the smallest @xmath21 , which is @xmath68 for @xmath69 . in this case",
    "the weakening factor is rewritten as @xmath70 which is always larger than @xmath71 .",
    "so , in comparison with the bs , the fluctuation is reduced in the hgs . for large @xmath43 with @xmath69 ,",
    "the fluctuation is only about half as much as the binomial states .",
    "this is an important feature of the hgs .",
    "let us introduce mandel s @xmath1 parameter @xcite defined by @xmath72 which measures the deviation from the poisson distribution ( the coherent state , @xmath73 ) . if @xmath74 , the field is called sub(super)-poissonian , respectively . for the hgs , it is easy to find that @xmath75 which is generally negative since @xmath76 and @xmath77 , namely , the field on the hgs is sub - poissonian .",

    "the extreme case is @xmath81 since @xmath82 is always positive . in the case @xmath10 and @xmath83 , namely , on the number states , the extreme case occurs .",
    "we say the field is antibunched if the second - order correlation function @xmath84 satisfies @xcite @xmath85 for the hgs @xmath86 which always satisfies the condition ( [ an ] ) .",
    "so the hgs is antibunched .",
    "in fact , the occurrence of antibunching effect and sub - poissonian are concomitant for single mode and time independent fields .    in the binomial state limit @xmath29",
    ", @xmath84 reduces to the second - order correlation function @xmath87 of the bs @xmath88 since the factor @xmath89 , the hgs are more strongly antibunched than the bs .",

    "when @xmath6 is around 0.5 , the @xmath21 can be closest to @xmath43 ( two times ) , and the hgs are far different from the bs .",

    "this deformation pattern appears similar to that of @xmath1 function with respect to @xmath6 given in fig.4 of @xcite .",
    "however , they are essentially different : increase in @xmath6 brings the gain of the energy or the mean photon number as given ( [ meanen ] ) , while the changes of @xmath21 does not correspond to any change of the mean energy due to eq.([meanen ] ) .",
    "fig.3(e ) is the @xmath1-function of hgs for @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath115 .",
    "this @xmath1-function is almost the same as that of bs ( see fig.4(c ) in ref.@xcite ) , as expected .    from the @xmath1-functions we can also study the squeezing properties by examining the deformation of their contours . as",
    "before we pay our attention to the case @xmath69 and explain the drastic changes of squeezing for small @xmath21 .",
    "fig.4 are the plots of contours of @xmath1-function for @xmath115 , @xmath69 and @xmath132 , 28 and @xmath133 ( binomial states ) .",
    "we find that , when we decrease @xmath21 , the contour is first squeezed ( fig.4(b ) ) in the @xmath90 direction until a maximum squeezing is reached .",
    "then the contour deforms to the shape of an _ ear _ , which occupies a wider range in the @xmath90 direction and the squeezing is reduced ( fig.4(a ) ) . from this approach",
    "we can also explain the drastic increase of squeezing for @xmath117 and @xmath69 . in fact , when @xmath21 becomes smaller , the shape of the contour is compressed , which corresponds to the strong squeezing . and this change continues until the smallest value of @xmath21 allowed for @xmath69 , ie .",
    "however , in contrast to the case @xmath115 , the case @xmath117 does not give rise to the shape of an _ ear _",
    "( fig.4(d ) ) .",
    "the wigner function in the series form is defined as @xcite @xmath135 where @xmath136 , @xmath137 is the density matrix ( projector on the hgs ) and takes the form @xmath138 for the case in hand .",
    "it is easy to compute that @xmath139 here @xmath140 are given by @xcite @xmath141 where @xmath142 are the generalized laguerre polynomials .    since the case @xmath26 is simply the binomial state and its wigner functions",
    "have been investigated in detail in ref.@xcite , we here consider the simplest nontrivial case : @xmath143 .",
    "fig.5 are some plots of the wigner function of hgs for @xmath143 and different @xmath6 : ( a ) @xmath144 ( b ) @xmath69 , ( c ) @xmath130 and ( d ) the number state @xmath145 ( @xmath146 and @xmath46 ) . in each case we choose the smallest possible value of @xmath21 for given @xmath6 and @xmath43 to see the maximal contrast with the bs .",
    "we note that the case @xmath147 is just the vacuum state and its wigner function is simply the gaussian centered at the origin . as @xmath6 increases from 0 , this gaussian distribution continuously deforms to the wigner function of @xmath145 , as shown in fig.5 . from @xmath144 ,",
    "the negative parts of the wigner functions are very clearly visible and this signifies the nonclassical properties .",
    "fig.6 are two plots of the wigner function of the bs for @xmath143 and ( @xmath148 ) @xmath69 and ( @xmath149 ) @xmath130 . comparing them with those of hgs , namely , fig.5 ( b , c )",
    ", we find that in the case @xmath69 the winger distributions of hgs and bs are markedly different : distribution of hgs has two negative peaks while the bs has only one .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath130 , two distributions are almost the same .",
    "this is understandable since for @xmath130 , @xmath21 must be very big and the hgs are very close to the bs .",
    "we have shown various properties of the _ hypergeometric states_. the relationship with the bs is clarified together with the coherent state and the number state limits .",
