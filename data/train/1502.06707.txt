    "adiabatic expansion and photon number conservation have produced a cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with a black - body temperature of @xmath5k @xcite that evolves with redshift @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "this temperature - redshift relation is an important test of the big - bang paradigm @xcite and of spatial homogeneity @xcite .",
    "models like decaying vacuum energy density and gravitational ` adiabatic ' photon creation predict a more general scaling @xcite .",
    "an imprint on the @xmath8 relation can be produced if the period of accelerated expansion is driven by a phase transition @xcite .",
    "the non - conservation of the photon number density changes the temperature - redshift and the distance duality relations .",
    "two functional forms have been considered in the literature @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite , with @xmath4 and @xmath10 constant parameters ; at low redshifts , the differences between both functional forms are small and only the first scaling is usually tested . in most scenarios , deviations of adiabatic evolution are associated with distortions of the cmb black - body spectrum @xcite and are strongly constrained by the current firas upper limit of @xcite .",
    "a departure of the standard temperature - redshift relation would represent an important challenge to the current cosmological model and it represents a test of these alternative scenarios .",
    "the earliest measurements on cmb black - body temperature evolution were obtained using the relative populations of atomic fine - structure levels which are excited by the background radiation @xcite . @xcite",
    "measured @xmath11k using the rotational excitation of co molecules in quasar spectral lines , value compatible with @xmath12k , the black - body temperature expected at that redshift with the standard temperature - redshift relation .",
    "using quasar spectral lines , the best constraint on deviations from adiabatic evolution at present is @xmath13 @xcite ; they also obtained a very stringent individual measurement of the cmb temperature : @xmath14k .",
    "recently the planck collaboration obtained a much tighter constraint @xcite by including data on large scale structure to the cmb data but their measurement @xmath15 applies to models where the deviation from adiabatic evolution starts at the last scattering surface .",
    "the temperature - redshift relation has also been probed using the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich , 1970 ; hereafter tsz ) .",
    "the tsz anisotropy induced by clusters of galaxies along the line of sight @xmath16 is @xmath17 .",
    "the comptonization parameter is defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the cluster optical depth , @xmath20 are the electron density and temperature evaluated along the line of sight @xmath21 , @xmath22 the thomson cross section , @xmath23 the boltzmann constant , @xmath24 the electron mass and @xmath25 the speed of light .",
    "this effect depends on the frequency of observation @xmath26 as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the planck constant and @xmath29 the cmb black - body temperature at the cluster location . in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath30 .",
    "this spectral dependence is different from that of all known foregrounds , making the tsz effect an effective tool for detecting clusters as well as a potential probe of the redshift evolution of the background temperature .",
    "if the universe evolves adiabatically then @xmath31 is independent of redshift .",
    "we will test deviations from adiabatic evolution assuming the @xcite parametrization , that is , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite proposed to constrain @xmath4 by measuring the zero cross frequency of clusters at different redshifts that , for adiabatic evolution , occurs at @xmath34 .",
    "the measurement of the cross - over frequency is problematic since the tsz is inherently weak and could be dominated by uncertain systematics . as an alternative",
    ", early studies fit the tsz signal at different frequencies to measure the function @xmath35 .",
    "we shall denote this procedure the _",
    "fit method_. @xcite suggested the _ ratio method _ , constraining @xmath4 by using the ratio of the tsz anisotropy at different frequencies , @xmath36 . by taking ratios , the dependence on the comptonization parameter",
    "is removed and there is no need to account for model uncertainties on the gas density and temperature profiles . on the negative side ,",
    "the analysis is more complicated since the distribution of the temperature anisotropy ratios is highly non - gaussian @xcite and the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( sunyaev & zeldovich , 1972 ; hereafter ksz ) generated by cluster peculiar velocities is a component always present at the cluster location that can not be separated from the cosmological signal . for small number of clusters the effect needs to be taken into account while it is expected to be less important for large cluster samples .",
    "@xcite found @xmath37 from the tsz measurement of the coma and a2163 clusters .",
    "later , from the data on just 13 clusters , @xcite set up an upper limit of @xmath38 in the range @xmath39 at the 68% confidence level .    in 2013",
    "the planck collaboration released their first maps of the temperature fluctuations of the cmb sky using 15.5 months of data @xcite .",
    "the low frequency instrument ( lfi ) produced three maps with frequencies 30 , 44 and 70  ghz and angular resolution from 33 to @xmath40 .",
    "the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) was sensitive to a wider range of frequencies , from 100 to 857  ghz and scanned the cmb sky at much higher angular resolution , from 10 to @xmath41 .",
    "due to its large frequency coverage , high resolution and low noise , the _ planck _ satellite is an optimal instrument for detecting the tsz distortion of the cmb spectrum induced by clusters . to clean the cmb data from foreground contributions , the planck collaboration also released maps of ( a ) thermal dust and residual cosmic infrared background emission , ( b ) synchrotron , free - free and spinning dust emission , ( c ) co contributions , that are most important at 100 , 217 and 353  ghz and ( d ) maps of dust temperature and opacity @xcite .",
    "additional products required to analyze the data such as masks and noise maps were also released . using _ planck _",
    "data and a sample of 813 clusters up to redshift @xmath42 , @xcite obtained @xmath43 .",
    "their sample included x - ray and tsz selected clusters .",
    "using clusters detected with the south pole telescope , @xcite measured @xmath44 , also compatible with adiabatic evolution .",
    "in this article we will apply the techniques developed in @xcite to test the standard temperature - redshift relation .",
    "our cluster catalog comprises @xmath45 clusters selected from the x - ray rosat data and with well measured properties ; of those , 481 will be used in this study .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .  2 we describe our data and pipeline ; in sec .",
    "3 we present our results and in sec .",
    "4 we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "we constrain the temperature - redshift evolution of the background temperature using a cluster catalog selected from rosat data and the _ planck _ nominal maps released in 2013 .",
    "we will only use hfi data , originally released in healpix format with resolution @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "our catalog contains 782 clusters , of which 623 are outside the planck pccs - sz - union mask @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "they have been selected from three x - ray flux limited surveys : the rosat - eso flux limited x - ray catalog ( reflex , bhringer et al . 2004 ) , the extended brightest cluster sample ( ebcs , ebeling et al . 1998 and 2002 ) and the clusters in the zone of avoidance ( ciza , ebeling et al .",
    "details of the combined catalog are given in @xcite .",
    "all clusters have well measured positions , x - ray fluxes and luminosities in the [ 0.1,2.4]kev rosat band , spectroscopic redshifts and angular extents of the x - ray emitting region .",
    "the catalog also lists the x - ray temperature derived from the @xmath47 relation of @xcite and the core radii @xmath48 and central electron density @xmath49 obtained by fitting a @xmath50 model to the rosat data .",
    "we compute the radius at which the mean overdensity of the cluster is 500 times the critical density , @xmath51 , from the @xmath52 relation of @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath53 as the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath51 and the angular size @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the diameter angular distance of each cluster in the @xmath56cdm model . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we represent the redshift and mass distribution of the clusters in our catalog .",
    "the clusters in our sample have masses in the interval @xmath57\\times 10^{14}$]m@xmath58 and are located at redshifts @xmath59 , relatively lower compared with other catalogs .",
    "the catalog used by @xcite contains x - ray and planck selected clusters . compared with our catalog ,",
    "the mcxc sample @xcite includes clusters from sources that we have not considered such as noras @xcite , sgp @xcite and nep @xcite .",
    "also , our catalog does not include clusters from x - ray pointed surveys which tend to find mainly low - mass systems but out to high redshift . for redshifts @xmath60 and masses @xmath61 all our clusters except ten are listed in the mcxc sample . in the same mass and redshift",
    "range the planck sz catalog contains 555 clusters . of those ,",
    "only 239 are at less than @xmath62 away from members of our sample .",
    "an important difference with the latter catalog is that the planck collaboration estimates @xmath53 using the scaling relation @xmath63 of @xcite while we use the @xmath52 relation from @xcite and the resulting masses differ , on average , by 30% .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 158 clusters with redshifts @xmath64 , selected by their tsz signal . when cluster candidates are identified using cmb data the adiabatic evolution is assumed , biasing cluster selection towards those candidates that mimic this behavior .",
    "the south pole group verified that this effect was not significant .",
    "nevertheless , due to their selection criteria , negative temperature fluctuations were more likely negative than positive and taking into account this second effect increased their error bars a 30% @xcite . therefore , it is important to verify the results of other groups using only x - ray selected clusters since they will not be affected by these biases . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we present the mean redshift , angular scale , x - ray luminosity and mass averaged over the full cluster sample and in several subsamples selected according to x - ray luminosity mass and redshift . for better comparison we chose the redshift bins as in @xcite ; within each redshift bin , we select all clusters with @xmath65 or @xmath66 erg / s . in the table",
    "we do not quote a redshift bin in the mass and x - ray luminosity subsamples when it coincides with the bin of the full sample .",
    ".average properties of different cluster subsamples from the general catalog .",
    "clusters have been selected by luminosity and mass within each redshift bin . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we can use the upper limit on @xmath4 given above to constrain the phenomenological model of @xcite using the temperature - redshift relation derived by @xcite . the constrain is given in terms of the effective equation of state of a hypothetical decaying dark energy model .",
    "from the bounds on the deviation from adiabatic invariance we find @xmath67 , fully compatible with the concordance @xmath56cdm model .",
    "this constrain represents a 20% improvement over the latest measurement of @xcite .",
    "our estimates do not take into account the effect of subtracting the tsz effect from the lgmca map using the @xmath68 frequency dependence .",
    "[ fig3]a shows that the average temperature anisotropy at the cluster locations has @xmath69k residual compared with the same measurement at random positions in the sky averaged over 100 realizations .",
    "this difference is well within the errors and compatible with sample variance .",
    "we checked that the average on the six redshift bins was random , oscillating around the mean , indicating that there was not such systematic effect .",
    "nevertheless , if the redshift evolution has @xmath70 then there would exist a residual tsz at the cluster location and we need to consider the biases introduced if the @xmath71k difference was in fact systematic . since the lgmca map is a combination of wmap and planck data at different frequencies , when subtracting the same lgmca map to all planck nominal maps , the residual tsz anisotropy would shift the zero cross frequency but will not change the dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "the magnitude and sign of the temperature shift is difficult to predict since it would depend on the cluster redshift , mass and extent and on the lgmca mixing matrices estimated for a set of input channels on a patch of data at a given wavelet scale .",
    "we reanalyzed the data subtracting a fix @xmath72k from the measured temperature anisotropies of all the clusters and at all frequencies and obtained that the value of @xmath4 decreased by @xmath73 in the fit method and remained within the errors in the ratio method ; i.e. , we would be obtaining a value closer to @xmath74 by this amount .",
    "if @xmath75 then the residual tsz at the cluster location would be positive and so would be the bias in @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , by using the tsz frequency dependence of an adiabatically evolving universe , our method could be masking the effect of a non - adiabatic evolution .",
    "taking into account this effect , our final constraint would be @xmath76 where the parenthesis indicates the systematic contribution . at the 2@xmath77 level , this result is both compatible with all the upper limits from tsz and spectral lines .",
    "we have constrained the deviation of the adiabatic evolution of the cmb black - body temperature applying two different estimators to a sample of x - ray selected clusters and using foreground cleaned planck nominal maps . by not including clusters selected by their tsz signature",
    ", we avoid biasing our sample to those clusters that are closest to adiabatic evolution . following @xcite we distributed our cluster in six bins of redshift .",
    "the constrains using the ratio and fit methods were @xmath78 and @xmath1 , respectively ; the fit method producing statistically more significant results than the ratio method since the latter is very sensitive to small denominators .",
    "the constrains are weakened if we add a hypothetical systematic effect due to the component separation method used to construct the lgmca map and become @xmath76 and @xmath79 , compatible with the results given in the literature at the @xmath80 confidence level .",
    "compared with @xcite the errors in the ratio method are at least a factor of two worse . while our sample contains four times as many clusters , they are located at much lower redshift , where the statistic is less sensitive .",
    "however , our implementation of the fit method provides the best constraints on @xmath4 to date using only cmb data .",
    "for instance , as illustrated in fig  [ fig7 ] , by using the lgmca reconstruction of the intrinsic cmb temperature anisotropies to remove the cosmological contribution from our maps , we have reduced the errors compared with @xcite and obtained the best bound to date .",
    "the constrain is also interesting since our cluster sample has the lowest mean redshift .",
    "we constrain deviations of adiabatic evolution within @xmath59 , well in the period of accelerated expansion .",
    "our results are comparable with a similar analysis carried out by @xcite using a catalog of clusters at higher redshifts and fully complements their findings .",
    "since our clusters have been selected using x - ray data , they are not affected by possible biases associated with selecting clusters using the tsz effect , providing a consistency check to previous results .",
    "we continue to expand our x - ray cluster sample to probe higher redshifts , where systematic biases would be larger and could be estimated better .",
    "@xcite has argued that low redshift energy injections that could produce a non - adiabatic evolution of the universe are strongly constrained by the upper limit set by firas .",
    "nevertheless , and independently of theoretical expectations , measurements of the temperature - redshift relation of the cmb black - body temperature provide a strong consistency check of the current big - bang paradigm .",
