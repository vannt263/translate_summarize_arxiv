    "the success of the standard model ( sm ) over the last two decades should not obscure the importance of thoroughly investigating the weak interaction .",
    "it is interesting to consider that 15 years ago , when neutrino scattering experiments had measured @xmath6 , the following sm constraints were available  @xcite : ( ) & = & 83.0 2.8 + ( ) & = & 93.8 2.3 deviations could be accommodated in those errors ! today we have measured  @xcite  to @xmath7 ,  to @xmath8  gev , and  to @xmath9  gev  the success of the sm is so thorough that it can only be wrong at the quantum loop level , and even then , beyond leading order . despite this rousing success , it is still necessary to test the sm by confronting experimental observations with theoretical predictions as any deviations might point to new physics . as a fundamental parameter of the sm ,",
    "the mass of the w boson , , is of particular importance .    aside from being an important test of the sm in its own right",
    ", the direct measurement of  can be used to set constraints on the mass of the higgs boson , , by comparison with theoretical predictions involving radiative corrections sensitive to .",
    "the constraints imposed using  are complimentary to the constraints imposed by the asymmetry ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , ... ) and width ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , ... ) measurements .",
    "for example , the very precise asymmetry measurements presently yield the tightest constraints on , but are very sensitive to the uncertainty in the hadronic contribution to the photon vacuum polarisation , @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , the constraint afforded by a direct measure of  is comparably tight but with a much smaller sensitivity to @xmath16 , and is presently dominated by statistical uncertainties  @xcite .      at lep w bosons",
    "are predominantly produced in pairs through the reaction @xmath2 , with each w subsequently decaying either hadronically ( ) , or leptonically ( , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or @xmath19 ) .",
    "this yields three possible four - fermion final states , hadronic ( ) , semi - leptonic ( ) , and leptonic ( ) , with branching fractions of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the  production cross - section varies from @xmath23  pb at @xmath3  gev to @xmath24  pb at @xmath25  gev .",
    "these can be contrasted with the production cross - sections for the dominant backgrounds @xmath26  pb , @xmath27  pb , @xmath28  pb , and @xmath29  pb . aside from the @xmath30 process , which falls from @xmath31  pb at @xmath3  gev , these background cross - sections vary slowly for @xmath32  gev , when the @xmath33 process begins to turn - on .",
    "there are two main methods available for measuring  at lep2 .",
    "the first exploits the fact that the  production cross - section is particularly sensitive to  for @xmath34 . in this threshold ( th )",
    "region , assuming sm couplings and production mechanisms , a measure of the production cross - section yields a measure of . in early 1996",
    "the four lep experiments collected roughly @xmath35 of data at @xmath36  gev , resulting in a combined determination of the w boson mass of @xmath37  gev , where the uncertaintiess correspond to experimental and lep beam energy respectively  @xcite .",
    "the second method uses the shape of the reconstructed invariant mass distribution to extract a measure of .",
    "this method is particularly useful for @xmath38  gev where the  production cross - section is larger and phase - space effects on the reconstructed mass distribution are smaller .",
    "each experiment collected roughly @xmath35 at @xmath39  gev  @xcite in later 1996 , and in 1997 , roughly @xmath0 at @xmath40  gev .",
    "since most of the lep2 data has been collected at center - of - mass energies well above the   threshold , the lep2  determination is dominated by these direct reconstruction ( dr ) methods .",
    "for this reason , the rest of this article will concentrate on the details of this method .",
    "to measure  using direct reconstruction techniques one must      each of these steps are discussed in detail in the section below and in reference [ 5 ] . it should be noted that none of the lep experiments presently exploits the  final state in the dr methods  ; it is therefore discussed no further ."
