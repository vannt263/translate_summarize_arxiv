    "this note is concerned with the study of black hole solutions to the einstein - maxwell - dilaton system with negative cosmological constant , and in particular solutions in which the time and the space coordinates scale differently : @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is called the dynamical exponent .",
    "this kind of scaling is observed in many condensed matter systems , and has been investigated with great detail from a holographic perspective since the seminal work @xcite , in which one includes an extra holographic coordinate , scaling as @xmath4 , with a boundary in which the field theory lives .",
    "the precise relation between the field theory of interest and the dual holographic theory is not yet known , and a construction of the holographic dictionary for this theories is under current investigation @xcite .    in @xcite , the authors proposed that gravitational theories realizing the lifshitz symmetry should asymptotically approach the so - called lifshitz metric @xmath5 which has @xmath6 killing vectors , related to the generators of the symmetry algebra in the field theory ( spatial rotations , spatial translations , time translations and dilatations ) @xcite .",
    "such a metric can be obtained in einstein gravity only in the presence of matter fields .",
    "most of the solutions constructed in the literature consider a system in which gravity is coupled to a massive vector field , described by the proca action . if the mass of the vector field has the appropriate value the metric is asymptotically lifshitz .",
    "the caveat with the proca approach to asymptotically lifshitz black holes is that only a few solutions are known analytically ( and for specific values of dimensions , @xmath7 , and the dynamical exponent @xmath3 ) , and in top - down approaches the solution relies on numeric calculations @xcite . to find a generic solution for @xmath8 and @xmath9 it has proven useful to consider instead the einstein - maxwell - dilaton action with negative cosmological constant @xcite .    following the holographic philosophy , the construction of black hole setups asymptotically approaching are interesting to describe thermal field theories . furthermore",
    ", if the effects of a global @xmath10 symmetry in the field theory are to be included , one has to consider a gauge field in the bulk of the @xmath11-dimensional gravitational theory .",
    "with this in mind we study the action @xcite @xmath12 + s_{gh } \\ , \\ ] ] where the second term is the gibbons - hawking term , needed to have a well defined variational problem for the graviton . below we will see that additional boundary terms must be added to obtain a finite on - shell action .",
    "these terms and the gh term do not affect the equations of motion derived from the action , which present a solution describing a charged black hole / brane @xmath13 where we have set @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the amplitude of the scalar field .",
    "notice that in the metric we have generalized the spatial section to admit @xmath16-dimensional maximally symmetric manifolds with positive , null or negative curvatures ( @xmath17 respectively ) . in the case @xmath18",
    "one of the gauge fields acquires a phase and we do not consider it further .",
    "the case @xmath19 can be obtained by taking the large - sphere - radius limit from the @xmath20 case @xcite .",
    "we will focus in the last case in the following , keeping @xmath21 explicit in some expressions . from now on we will set @xmath22 for concreteness . in the @xmath23 limit , in which goes to the @xmath24 metric , this solution goes to the ads - reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "this model has been used to study the conditions that strongly interacting fermions should obey to satisfy the arpes sum rules @xcite .",
    "the caveat this solution presents is the behavior of the @xmath25 gauge fields and the scalar @xmath26 .",
    "these diverge at the boundary , and the variation relative to the killing vector @xmath27 is not vanishing , therefore spoiling the asymptotic lifshitz symmetry algebra .",
    "we will not try to make sense of these fields in this note , and therefore the model we use must not be considered as a dual to a non - relativistic field theory , but as an ir effective theory that must be completed in the uv .    from the solutions",
    "and we can define charges associated to the badly behaved radial electric fields ( see equation below ) .",
    "these charges are fixed in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath3 and @xmath15 ( contrary to the case in equation , where it is given by a free parameter @xmath28 ) .",
    "this suggests that these two fields should be considered in an ensemble in which their charges are kept fixed .",
    "the original einstein - maxwell - dilaton action is appropriate for an ensemble in which the charges can vary @xcite , and therefore it must be modified . in other words ,",
    "the boundary condition for the gauge fields imposed at the boundary of spacetime is not a dirichlet boundary condition , but neumann . to account for this we have to supplement the action with a boundary term to make the variational problem well defined",
    "this is accounted by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is",
    "the boundary metric and @xmath31 is a unit vector orthogonal to @xmath32 hypersurfaces .",
    "an alternative ( equivalent ) course of action is to perform a legendre transform of the action with respect to the electric fields under consideration @xcite .",
    "this transformation changes the equations of motion , but - is still a solution , only that the fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not present in the new setup , since the solution has been already plugged into the legendre transformed action .",
    "[ [ on - shell - action ] ] on - shell action + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as usual in holography , the evaluation of the on - shell action diverges when one evaluates it at the boundary , and a renormalization procedure is needed . since the publication of the solution - , several papers appeared dealing with the holographic renormalization of asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these , however , focus on the proca action , and we will not consider them in the following . indeed , the renormalization we describe in this section can be understood from the procedure for asymptotically ads spacetimes with a few changes .    to construct the needed counterterm action in asymptotically @xmath35 spacetimes one has to solve a hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite , which can be done systematically by expanding the new term in a derivatives series . for a counterterm depending only on gravitational terms",
    "this accounts to an expansion in powers of the boundary ricci scalar @xmath36 , contractions of the boundary ricci tensor @xmath37 , the boundary riemann tensor , and generic combinations of them .",
    "here we denote the boundary metric as @xmath30 . the number of counterterms to add depends on the dimensionality of the theory under consideration .",
    "generically , terms with @xmath38 ( and combinations of @xmath39 boundary ricci scalars , ricci tensors and riemann tensors with all indices contracted ) will be needed if the field theory dimension is @xmath40 .    in the present case such terms",
    "will regularize a field theory dimensionality @xmath41 .",
    "this implies that to regularize the theory under consideration for generic @xmath3 we need to consider an infinite number of counterterms .",
    "this is an impossible task , since for increasing value of @xmath39 the combinations of curvature quantities increase in number ( see @xcite for the generic expression up to sixth order in derivatives in asymptotically ads spacetimes ) .",
    "there is one property of our solution we can use to circumvent this , though .",
    "focusing in the @xmath20 case , the boundary metric has a @xmath42 topology and is static , implying that the boundary riemann tensor takes a very simple form : any component with an index along the @xmath43 direction vanishes , and the spatial part is that of a maximally symmetric @xmath16-dimensional manifold with positive curvature . in particular , this means that any contraction of @xmath39 boundary riemann tensors , ricci tensors and ricci scalars will be proportional to @xmath38 , implying that the counterterm , expressed partially on - shell , is a power series in @xmath36 .    for fixed @xmath7 and @xmath3 we can truncate the @xmath36 series and find what are the coefficients weighting each power of the boundary ricci scalar to cancel divergences .",
    "when several examples are worked out , we can find a generic expression for the coefficient in front of every power of the boundary ricci scalar , for arbitrary @xmath7 and @xmath3 . assuming that these coefficients are the first coefficients of the infinite series in @xmath36 , we induce the form of the @xmath44 coefficient accompanying @xmath45 in the series , and re - sum it .",
    "after this is done we find the counterterm , was suggested in @xcite for @xmath46 , and in @xcite it was written for generic @xmath7 . ]",
    "@xmath47 this counterterm precisely cancels the value of the on - shell action in the case where no black hole is present , meaning that we could have defined it by covariantizing the on - shell action ( using he boundary ricci scalar ) in the zero temperature , zero charge setup .",
    "this is how the @xmath48 case was found in @xcite , and shows that the counterterm is valid in any number of dimensions and for arbitrary dynamical exponent @xmath9 , despite it being derived in the inductive way described before .",
    "for the thermal case we obtain a finite renormalized on - shell action , @xmath49 , evaluated at a cutoff ( and taken to the boundary ) @xmath50    one could have also considered the legendre transformed action with respect to the physical charge @xmath51 .",
    "it can be checked easily that the same counterterm does the job in this case , since the legendre transform is equivalent to the inclusion of a boundary term ( see equation and the comments around it ) , which in our case give a finite contribution .",
    "after this consideration , the on - shell legendre transformed action reads @xmath52    [ [ internal - energy ] ] internal energy + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the trick used in the renormalization of the on - shell action is not useful when we try to renormalize the stress - energy tensor in the field theory .",
    "the reason is that we have used the fact that topology of the boundary metric is @xmath42 to express curvature invariants composed by the riemann tensor , the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar as powers of the ricci scalar alone .",
    "however , the calculation of the boundary stress energy tensor involves a variation of the action with respect to the boundary metric , and this result will be sensitive to the precise combination of curvature tensors that we have . despite these considerations ,",
    "let us write here the brown - york tensor as derived by considering the counterterm @xmath53 in principle , @xmath54 should have corrections involving terms proportional to contractions of curvature tensors with two free indices ( for example @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) . as an example , the lengthy expression one gets considering the most generic counterterm up to six derivatives of the boundary metric can be seen in @xcite .",
    "now , the staticity of our solution implies that any component of the riemann tensor with an index in the time direction vanishes .",
    "this in turn means that the @xmath57 component can still be evaluated , since the corrections to cancel for this component . with the evaluation of @xmath58",
    "we can calculate the renormalized energy density in the field theory straightforwardly , obtaining @xmath59 with @xmath60 involving only the spatial direction components of the boundary metric , @xmath61 a killing vector and @xmath21 the unit vector orthogonal to @xmath62 surfaces .",
    "this result coincides withe the komar mass result used in @xcite by subtracting a reference background .",
    "the temperature can be defined from the inverse of the euclidean time by the absence of singularities when performing a wick rotation , giving an explicit expression @xmath63 that can be found in @xcite .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath64 can be traded by the radius of the horizon , which is defined by @xmath65 .",
    "the entropy is given , as usual , by the bekenstein - hawking formula @xmath66 .",
    "the charge carried by the gauge field @xmath67 can be obtained from the gauss law , and the chemical potential associated to this charge in the field theory is obtained , as usual in the holographic context , from the value of the corresponding gauge field at the boundary .",
    "these calculations give @xmath68 where we have used the usual boundary condition @xmath69 .",
    "an analogous calculation for the chemical potential associated to the badly behaved fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 implies a divergent value .",
    "however , as we work in an ensemble in which the charge associated to these fields is kept fixed , explicit factors of these chemical potentials will not appear in the thermodynamic relations .",
    "[ [ thermodynamic - potentials ] ] thermodynamic potentials + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    with the relations given above it is straightforward to check the relation @xmath72 with @xmath73 the temperature . actually , the differential thermodynamic relations in the grand - canonical ensemble ( in which @xmath74 is allowed to vary and the potential @xmath75 is fixed ) are also satisfied .",
    "we then conclude that the renormalized on - shell action ( times the temperature ) corresponds to the free energy of the field theory in the grand - canonical ensemble .    for the legendre transformed action one finds @xmath76 and looking at differential relations the identification with the free energy in the canonical ensemble",
    "is realized .",
    "this confirms the educated guess in @xcite , where these potentials were defined from the r.h.s .",
    "of the previous two equations , without going through the renormalization procedure . in",
    "we have subtracted the @xmath77 value to make contact with the analysis in that paper . here",
    "@xmath78 is the energy with the value corresponding to the extremal solution subtracted .",
    "[ [ phase - diagrams ] ] phase diagrams + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we show the dependence of the phase diagrams with the dynamical exponent in figure [ fig.phases ] , for both the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles .    for @xmath79",
    "the situation is analogous to the ads - reissner - nordstrm case discussed in @xcite ( which corresponds to the @xmath48 case in this note ) .",
    "there is a line of first order phase transitions in the grand - canonical ensemble separating the thermal lifshitz solution ( no black hole but periodic euclidean time ) valid at low values of the temperature and the chemical potential , from the black hole setup . for large values of the chemical potential and vanishing temperature",
    "the dominating solution is a finite - entropy extremal black hole , which is expected to decay into an unspecified ground state . in the canonical ensemble",
    "there is a line of first order phase transitions between small and large black holes , terminating at a critical point above which we have a crossover . at @xmath80",
    "we have the analogous to the hawking - page transition @xcite .",
    "the shadowed region in this diagram marks electrically unstable setups .    for @xmath81 the situation in the grand - canonical case stays unchanged , but in the canonical case the line of first order phase transitions gets reduced to just the critical point at @xmath80 , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the hawking - page transition .",
    "the electric instability also disappears for this value of the dynamical exponent .    finally , for @xmath82 the phase diagrams simplifies in both ensembles .",
    "in the grand - canonical one the first order transitions disappear and the black hole setup ( extremal black hole setup in the @xmath77 case ) dominates everywhere in the phase diagram , except at a critical value of the chemical potential ( for @xmath77 ) where the dominating solution is lifshitz spacetime . in the canonical ensemble we do not find any phase transition .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have studied the thermodynamics of the solution presented in @xcite using holographic renormalization to calculate the free and internal energies of the system , related to the on - shell action and the @xmath57 component of the boundary brown york tensor , respectively .",
    "the fact that a counterterm can be given for generic values of @xmath7 and @xmath3 is possible due to the extremely simple boundary topology of the solution , which allows to re - sum the infinite series of counterterms . the most important limitation of this procedure being the impossibility to calculate the spatial components of the boundary stress - energy tensor .    in this renormalization procedure",
    "it is fundamental that we have performed the legendre transformation , or equivalently the addition of the boundary term in , canceling the divergent behavior of the gauge fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the on - shell action .",
