    "error correction codes have provided a way to correct these errors up to a certain probability threshold , thereby allowing scalable , fault - tolerant quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "the error occurring in a single computational step such as a one- or two - qubit gate is often characterized by a single number , typically related to the overlap between the desired and actual output state , averaged over all input states .",

    "we aim to implement definite gate operations and process matrices account for the effects of error , e.g. , due to dissipation and decoherence .",
    "it will be shown how @xmath3-matrices calculated once for one- and two - qubit gates can be concatenated to characterize circuits built from many of these gates .",
    "this will be exemplified in neutral atom quantum computing where the rydberg blockade mechanism is used for two - qubit quantum gates  @xcite .",
    "circuits comprised of rydberg mediated two - qubit gates may be directly compared to alternative multi - qubit implementations exploiting a single rydberg atom s ability to simultaneously control a number of neighboring atoms .",

    "such a process is described as a completely - positive linear map @xmath6 , and by introducing a complete basis of @xmath7 operators @xmath8 on the hilbert space , @xmath9 can be written  @xcite @xmath10 the @xmath11 elements @xmath12 constitute the process matrix @xmath3 .",
    "many techniques now exist to experimentally determine @xmath3 .",
    "standard quantum process tomography  @xcite successfully reproduces @xmath3 by measuring all output states via quantum _ state _ tomography  @xcite .",
    "this has been demonstrated in nmr  @xcite , optical  @xcite , and atomic systems  @xcite .",

    "if the system is subject to known dissipation and decoherence mechanisms , the quantum system evolution may be modeled theoretically and the process matrix be calculated by solution of the quantum master equation .",
    "a gate operation typically involves application of time dependent laser pulses .",
    "therefore , it is valuable to determine how losses and errors accumulate and contribute to different types of errors in the output .",
    "such detailed studies may also serve to confirm the values of experimental parameters  @xcite .    in a recent publication  @xcite",
    ", we described how to characterize a quantum controlled - phase gate subject to decay and dephasing . instead of simulating the evolution of a complete set of @xmath7 input states we gain access to all elements of @xmath3 by evolving a single maximally entangled pure state of the system and an idle ancilla system of the same hilbert space dimension  @xcite .",
    "the system is propagated stochastically using the monte carlo wave function method , which on average reproduces results of a master equation evolution  @xcite .",
    "process characterization using this approach has a number of advantages : first , for large @xmath5 , an adequate ensemble of wave functions is easier to store and evolve than density matrices .",
