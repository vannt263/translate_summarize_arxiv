    "the higgs boson is the last undiscovered particle of the standard model ( sm ) , and its discovery is a major goal of both the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) physics programs .",

    "recently , the tevatron collaborations have ruled out the mass range @xmath9 at 95% c.l .  @xcite .",
    "if a scalar particle is discovered at either collider , the measurement of its properties will be crucial to determine whether the particle found is the standard model higgs boson , or whether it hints at physics beyond the sm .",
    "the theoretical community has devoted significant effort to understanding precisely the production cross section and decay widths of the sm higgs particle in order to facilitate such studies .",
    "the dominant production mode at both the tevatron and the lhc is the partonic mechanism @xmath10 proceeding through a top - quark loop  @xcite .",
    "the exact next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to this process are known , including the corrections to the smaller bottom - quark induced contribution  @xcite . in the effective theory with the top quark integrated out by taking @xmath11 to produce an @xmath12 operator , both the nlo corrections  @xcite and the nnlo corrections",
    "are known  @xcite .",
    "when normalized to the full @xmath13-dependent leading - order result , this effective theory reproduces the exact nlo result to better than 1% for @xmath14 and to 10% or better for higgs boson masses up to 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "the nnlo differential distributions in the effective theory were first obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , and detailed studies of the effects of experimental cuts on higgs boson cross sections have been performed  @xcite .",
    "resummation of logarithmically - enhanced threshold corrections to the cross section has been studied  @xcite .",
    "it was recently demonstrated that corrections arising from the higgs coupling to @xmath1- and @xmath2-bosons could affect the @xmath15 cross section at the 6 - 7% level  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of such corrections is important for precision predictions of higgs boson properties , and also impacts the exclusion limits set by the tevatron collaborations .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty from missing higher - order terms is estimated to be roughly @xmath16 after these qcd and electroweak effects are accounted for .",
    "production of a higgs boson in association with one or more jets is an important process for experimental searches . for example , the study of @xmath17 with the subsequent decay @xmath18  @xcite or @xmath19  @xcite has significantly different kinematics than its background , and offers a good potential for higgs discovery at the lhc . at the tevatron ,",
    "the multi - jet bins contribute roughly 50% of the exclusion limit  @xcite .",
    "since the higgs boson obtains a transverse momentum from recoil against hard jets , the study of higgs+jet production is related to that of the higgs transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "the calculation of higgs boson production in association with a jet proceeding through top - quark loops , maintaining the exact dependence on the mass of the internal quark , was first presented in ref .",

    "in addition to aiding the discovery of the higgs boson , study of its transverse momentum distribution has been discussed as a probe of physics beyond the sm  @xcite .    in light of the current experimental sensitivity at the tevatron to higgs production in association with a jet , and also in preparation for future studies at the lhc",

    "these affect both the @xmath4 and @xmath3 partonic processes , and were first considered in ref .",
    "however , the interference of these such corrections with the top - quark initiated diagrams , which we find to be the dominant effect , was not studied . for observable values of the higgs transverse momentum at both the tevatron and the lhc ,",
