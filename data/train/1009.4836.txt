    "it has been also argued that graphene in a magnetic field is a promising system for the experimental observation of the highly oscillatory motion of the electric current known as zitterbewegung @xcite .",
    "in addition , revivals of electric currents in graphene in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite have been theoretically predicted and an exhaustive study of quantum wave - packet revivals , fractional revivals , classical periodicity in graphene was reported @xcite .    in recent times ,",

    "also , there has been an analysis of the level statistics of the graphene quantum dots observed in experiments ( for quantum dots smaller than 100 nm ) which has concluded that it is well described by the theory of chaotic dirac neutrino billiards @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , new experiments have been designed for the creation of graphene quantum dots @xcite by etching or scratching graphene islands including the study of energy levels in magnetic fields @xcite . additionally , graphene quantum dots have been point out to be very attractive as spin qubits in quantum information processing @xcite .",

    "we have calculated the classical and revival times for different values of the magnetic field @xmath26 which are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the quasiclassical evolution is analogous in both valleys as we can see in the insets of fig .",

    "for an initial gaussian wavepacket with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath80 and @xmath69 .",

    "systems with two quantum numbers offer richer possibilities for wave packet revivals ( for a theoretical analysis see @xcite ) .",
    "the classical periods yield straightforwardly @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( from @xcite @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively ) .",
    "now , the long - time revival structure depends on three possible times , given by @xcite @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the revival structure is constructed on the interplay between these times .",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "can be seen at @xmath95 as an interplay between the revival times , as we would expect .",
    "snapshots of the numerical simulation of the probability density are given in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] at several times .",
    "it is apparent that the regeneration of the density function is given at time @xmath96 .",
    "we want to remark that the typical scattering times should be taken into account for a more realistic description of this problem .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to understand the influence of shape deformations , impurities , or interactions on revivals , so a more detailed study of this topic could be made in a analogous way that has been done before ( see i.e. @xcite ) in graphene in a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "in this work we have presented time - dependent effects in the propagation of wavepackets on graphene quantum dots for different values of the magnetic field . when the wavepacket is sufficiently localized around some central quantum numbers ( @xmath6 , @xmath97 )",
    ", it evolves quasiclassically . at later times , it spreads leading to the collapse of the classical oscillations , but at times that are multiple or rational fractions of @xmath1 , the wavepacket regains its initial form .",
    "we have also shown revival time as an observable sign of breaking the valley degeneracy , that it is known as a prerequisite for spin - based quantum computing .",
    "it can be underline that we have found revivals of the electron wavepacket in a dirac system and we suggest that this realistic system could be used to simulate relativistic quantum revivals @xcite .",
