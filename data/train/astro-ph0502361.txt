    "the impressive results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite have done much to improve the standing of inflation as the leading paradigm for the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "however , they have not done much in the way of reining in the very large number of viable inflationary models , as the uncertainty in the key prediction of the spectral index @xmath0 remains significant ( and crucially encloses the special value of unity ) , and there is no sign of primordial gravitational waves ( specified by their ratio @xmath1 relative to density perturbations ) .    the large collection of inflationary models ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for extensive reviews ) has primarily been developed in an _ ad hoc _ manner , through selection of potentials motivated either by some considerations from fundamental physics or by simplicity .",
    "typically these potentials may have several parameters , meaning that the best that observations can hope to do is constrain those parameters . only if the potential is particularly tightly defined , for instance @xmath2 , can it be ruled out by present observations . despite the _ ad hoc _ way in which the collection of models has been constructed",
    ", their collective predictions cover a fair part of the @xmath0@xmath1 observational plane , albeit not evenly .",
    "it does not seem appropriate , however , to interpret this as saying that inflation models favour certain types of predictions .",
    "an alternative approach is to throw away the idea of taking input from fundamental physics and of enforcing simplicity ( usually on the potential @xmath3 driving inflation ) , and instead seek to generate models of inflation via some stochastic process , exploiting numerical techniques where appropriate .",
    "the archetypal such method is the inflationary flow equations , introduced by hoffman and turner @xcite and generalized to high order by kinney @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "intriguingly , models generated via the flow equations exhibit a very clear structure in the observational plane , primarily occupying the line @xmath4 or a diagonal locus extending to positive @xmath1 and negative @xmath5 .",
    "the principal aim of this paper is to consider whether or not such a structure is a robust prediction of stochastically - generated inflation models , or whether it is specific to the flow equations implementation . as a by - product",
    ", we provide a new implementation of the flow equations , and also explore the origin of their observational prediction more closely .",
    "we restrict ourselves to single - field inflation throughout .",
    "the flow equations take as their starting point a set of differential equations linking a set of slow - roll parameters defined from the hubble parameter @xmath6 . following the notation of kinney @xcite ,",
    "these are @xmath7 where primes are derivatives with respect to the scalar field .",
    "for example , the parameter @xmath8 equals @xmath9 and is often denoted @xmath10 . using the relation @xmath11 where we define the number of @xmath12-foldings @xmath13 as decreasing with increasing time , yields the flow equations @xmath14(^\\ell\\lambda_{{\\rm h}})+^{\\ell+1}\\!\\!\\ !      \\lambda_{{\\rm h } } \\ ; ; \\ ; \\ell \\ge2 \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a convenient definition .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , these equations actually have limited dynamical input from inflation , since in the form @xmath16 they are a set of identities true for any function @xmath17 , and the reparametrization to @xmath18 modifies only the measure along the trajectories , not the trajectories themselves . in that light",
    "it seems surprising that they can say much about inflation at all , but it turns out that the flow equations can be viewed as a ( rather complicated ) algorithm for generating functions @xmath19 which have a suitable form to be interpreted as inflationary models @xcite . in the following section we will compare their results with more direct ways of generating such functions , but in the meantime we will explore the flow equations themselves further .",
    "the standard implementation of the flow equations @xcite decides a truncation level for the hierarchy , sets ranges for the slow - roll parameters within which they are randomly selected , and integrates the flow equations either until the end of inflation , @xmath20 , or until a stable late - time attractor is reached . in the former case",
    "the equations are then integrated backwards for a suitable number of @xmath12-foldings ( either a fixed number such as 50 , or one also randomly chosen within a range @xcite ) where the observational quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and possibly others are evaluated and plotted . if a late - time attractor is reached the observables are read off at that point .",
    "here we use a new and more efficient implementation of the flow equations , exploiting the fact that the flow equations have an analytic solution discovered in ref .",
    "this is simply a polynomial in @xmath17 : @xmath21 \\,.\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath22 can be written in terms of the initial values of the slow - roll parameters as @xmath23 we use the ranges specified in ref .",
    "@xcite to randomly choose those values : @xmath24\\,;\\nonumber\\\\ \\sigma_0 & = & [ -0.5,0.5]\\,;\\nonumber\\\\ ^2\\lambda_{{\\rm h},0 } &   = & [ -0.05,0.05]\\,;\\\\   ^3\\lambda_{{\\rm h},0 } & = & [ -0.005,0.005]\\,;\\nonumber\\\\ & ... & \\nonumber\\\\ ^7\\lambda_{{\\rm h},0 } & = & 0\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last closes the hierarchy . to allow direct comparison with kinney s work",
    ", we use these ranges throughout , though one expects the results to be at least modestly dependent on the assumptions made here @xcite .",
    "however we take the equations to sixth - order , one order higher than kinney s main results , as one of the methods we will compare with later can only be implemented for even orders .",
    "as already shown by kinney , and separately verified by us , such a change in order has negligible impact on the flow equation predictions .",
    "we have carried out flow analyses at fifth and eighth orders as well as those displayed here .",
    "although this solution is analytic , there is still the need for one integration in order to determine the number of @xmath12-foldings as a function of @xmath25 , from eq .",
    "( [ e : nphi ] ) .",
    "however this is just a single equation to be integrated , regardless of the order to which the flow equations are taken .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the results from the flow equations , with the left - hand panel showing our new implementation based on the analytic solution , and the right - hand panel the traditional multi - equation implementation .",
    "the same sequence of 40,000 initial conditions was used in each case , with most of the points finishing at very small @xmath1 .",
    "the values of the spectral index @xmath0 and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath1 were obtained using second - order expressions and the conventions of ref .  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the diagrams are essentially identical point - by - point , though some minor differences occur from the way our implementations differ at very small values of @xmath26 .",
    "the diagram shows a clear and by now well - known structure first noted by hoffman and turner @xcite ; in addition to the majority of the points at small @xmath1 , there is a swathe of models running in a tightly - defined strip given approximately by @xmath27 , which is close to but not exactly the same as the power - law inflation condition @xcite . while kinney has been careful not to overinterpret the tendency of points to lie in this vicinity , noting that the measure on initial conditions is unknown , the results are often used to indicate where typical inflationary models might lie ( e.g.  ref .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to investigate the robustness of this structure .",
    "first however we investigate in a little more detail how the structure arises .",
    "kinney s main classification of trajectories is into those reaching the late - time attractor ( which all have @xmath28 and @xmath29 , corresponding to the field asymptoting into a non - zero minimum of the potential ) , those trajectories where inflation ends with @xmath20 , and the rejected set of trajectories which are unable to sustain sufficient inflation .",
    "we make a further division of those trajectories where inflation ends , into those where more than 50 @xmath12-foldings of inflation were obtained from the initial point ( meaning that the location where the observables were read off was reached by forwards integration from the initial point ) , and those where less than 50 @xmath12-foldings were obtained from the initial point , so that the point corresponding to the observables is effectively obtained by integrating backwards in time from the initial condition .",
    "@xmath12-foldings or more in the forwards integration.,width=283 ]    we find that the vast majority of random initial conditions which end inflation do so before @xmath30 @xmath12-foldings are achieved , in proportion roughly 35 to 1 . in figure  [ fig2 ] we show only points obtained by forwards integration ; as there are so few of these we increased the number of initial conditions tested up to 600,000 , so as to have a greater density of points ( 1225 in all , corresponding to just @xmath31 of all initial conditions ) than in fig .",
    "we find that those points correspond mainly to the region of parameter space where @xmath29 , and do not correspond to the main swathe of points seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . that swathe is therefore generated entirely from initial conditions that have to be integrated backwards in time .",
    "the change of integration direction is significant , because the critical point structure of the system is different in the inverse time direction ( the flow will typically be to the peaks of the potential rather than the troughs ) .",
    "although the backwards integration will pick out those critical points , they need not represent a distribution that might have arisen from whatever mechanism generated the initial conditions .",
    "however even the backwards integration does not explain the flow equations structure , because the only stable critical points under backwards integration are at @xmath28 and @xmath32 .",
    "the diagonal swathe is not stable , and , as already shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the trajectories evolve along it , typically following quite complicated paths when projected on the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "given that the location of the swathe is known , it would be nice to explain that behaviour via an analytic argument , but we have not been able to find an analytic approximation that makes clear why points are able to spend a long time in those parts of the plot .",
    "we now turn to alternative methods of generating random inflation models to contrast with the flow equations . as we have seen , the flow equations are equivalent to a taylor expansion of the function @xmath17 , which uniquely specifies the inflationary trajectory .",
    "however it is not the only way to do so .",
    "single - field inflation models can also be uniquely specified either by giving the potential @xmath3 or , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , by specifying the function @xmath19 .    in order to investigate the robustness of the flow equation predictions",
    ", one should therefore compare its results with those from expansions of these alternative functions , as there is no reason to prefer one over another .",
    "we will consider taylor expansions of both @xmath19 and @xmath3 , and additionally consider a pad approximant expansion of @xmath19 . in each case",
    "we take the randomly - chosen coefficients to correspond to the same ranges of slow - roll parameters used by kinney for his flow equations analysis  @xcite .",
    "if one of the three functions @xmath17 , @xmath3 and @xmath19 is specified , then the equivalent form of the others can readily be obtained .",
    "however once the functions are truncated as expansions at a given order , this correspondence breaks down , e.g. a sixth - order truncation of @xmath17 does not correspond to a sixth - order truncation of @xmath19 . in carrying out these expansions",
    ", we are therefore investigating different subsets of the general slow - roll inflation model .",
    "even if the expansions were taken to infinite order the correspondence between models will only be obtained provided each series is within its radius of convergence , which is not guaranteed . on the other hand , by choosing the same initial values for the slow - roll parameters in each case , we are ensuring that the functional forms at the initial point are sampled from the same distribution .",
    "the general strategy is similar to the new analytic approach to the flow equations , in that we choose coefficients randomly to generate a function @xmath19 , and then numerically integrate to determine the number of @xmath12-foldings supported",
    ". however at this point we do have to mention one drawback of using @xmath19 , which is that when the function crosses zero ( i.e.  into the unphysical region ) it typically does so linearly which means it does so in a finite number of @xmath12-foldings .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath19 generated from either the hubble parameter or the potential always approaches zero quadratically , generating an infinite number of @xmath12-foldings .",
    "the @xmath19 expansions are therefore unable to generate points corresponding to the late - time attractor .      the simplest expansion we can make is a taylor series @xmath33 where we assume @xmath34 initially .",
    "the higher slow - roll parameters can all be obtained by differentiating this function , and so we can determine the coefficients by randomly selecting the slow - roll parameters within the same ranges as for the flow equations using those relations . the relations , taking the expansion to sixth - order , are @xmath35\\,;\\nonumber\\\\   a_3 & = & \\frac{4\\pi^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{\\epsilon_0 } } \\left [ -3(^2\\lambda_{\\rm h_0})\\sigma_0 + 2\\epsilon_0(^2\\lambda_{{\\rm h},0})+6\\epsilon_0\\sigma_0 ^ 2 \\right .",

    "<S> typically models are motivated either by fundamental physics considerations or by simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative is to generate large numbers of models via a random generation process , such as the flow equations approach . </S>",
    "<S> the flow equations approach is known to predict a definite structure to the observational predictions . in this paper , we first demonstrate a more efficient implementation of the flow equations exploiting an analytic solution found by liddle ( 2003 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider alternative stochastic methods of generating large numbers of inflation models , with the aim of testing whether the structures generated by the flow equations are robust . </S>",
    "<S> we find that while typically there remains some concentration of points in the observable plane under the different methods , there is significant variation in the predictions amongst the methods considered . </S>"
