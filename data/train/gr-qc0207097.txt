    "in a recent paper  @xcite ( hereafter paper  ii ) , we demonstrate that the accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a rapidly rotating white dwarf can result in a rapidly rotating neutron star that is dynamically unstable to the bar - mode instability , which is the instability resulting from non - axisymmetric perturbations with angular dependence @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "this instability could emit a substantial amount of gravitational radiation that could be detectable by gravitational wave interferometers , such as ligo , virgo , geo and tama .",
    "however , for this instability to occur , the neutron star must have a @xmath5 greater than a critical value @xmath6 ( paper  ii ) . here",
    "@xmath7 is the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath8 is the gravitational binding energy .",
    "only the aic of white dwarfs that are composed of oxygen , neon and magnesium ( o - ne - mg white dwarfs ) with @xmath9 can produce neutron stars with such a high value of @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the angular velocity of the white dwarf and @xmath11 is the angular velocity at which mass shedding occurs on the equatorial surface .",
    "this type of source will not be promising for ligo  ii because its event rate is not expected to be very high .",
    "neutron stars are compact objects .",
    "general relativistic effects have a significant influence on both the structure and dynamical stability of the stars .",
    "recently , shibata , baumgarte , saijo and shapiro studied the dynamical stability of differentially rotating polytropes in full general relativity  @xcite and in the post - newtonian approximation  @xcite .",
    "they performed numerical simulations on the differentially rotating polytropes with some specified rotation law .",
    "they found that as the star becomes more compact , the critical value @xmath12 slightly decreases from the newtonian value @xmath13 to @xmath14 for their chosen rotation law .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether their result implies that relativistic effects would destabilize the stars we are studying , for the equilibrium structure of the star will also be changed by relativistic effects",
    ". the value of @xmath2 of a relativistic star will not be the same as that of a newtonian star with the same baryon mass and total angular momentum .",
    "the objective of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we develop a new numerical technique to construct the equilibrium structure of a rotating star with a specified specific angular momentum distribution to first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) order [ i.e. , including terms of order @xmath15 higher than the newtonian terms in the equations of motion ] .",
    "then we use this new technique to construct models of neutron stars corresponding to the collapse of the white dwarfs we studied in paper  ii and ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) and compare them with the newtonian models .",
    "equilibrium models of neutron stars in full general relativity have been built by many authors  @xcite .",
    "the neutron stars studied in the literature are either rigidly rotating or rotating with an _ ad hoc _ rotation law .",
    "new - born neutron stars resulting from core collapse of massive stars or accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs are differentially rotating  @xcite .",
    "it seems plausible that the rotation laws of these neutron stars could be approximated by the specific angular momentum distribution @xmath0 of the pre - collapse stars ( see paper  i and sec .",
    "[ sec : fullgr ] ) .",
    "here @xmath1 is the baryonic mass fraction inside the surface of constant specific angular momentum .",
    "equilibrium models of newtonian stars with a specified @xmath0 have been constructed by many authors  @xcite . however",
    ", none of these studies , to our knowledge , has been generalized to include the relativistic effects .",
    "if a rotating axisymmetric star is described by a barotropic equation of state , i.e. , the total energy density @xmath16 is a function of pressure only , then there is a constraint on the rotation law ( see section  [ sec : fullgr ] ) .",
    "this rotational constraint is usually written in the form @xmath17",
    "@xcite , where @xmath18 is an arbitrary function . here",
    "@xmath10 is the angular velocity of the fluid with respect to an inertial observer at infinity ; @xmath19 is the time component of the four - velocity and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the axial killing vector field of the spacetime . in the newtonian limit",
    ", this constraint reduces to the well - known result that @xmath10 is constant in the direction parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "the major obstacle in the construction of differentially rotating relativistic stars is that it is not clear what function @xmath18 should be used to produce the desired specific angular momentum distribution @xmath0 . in the next section , we will reformulate the rotational constraint in a way that can be used to impose the rotation law @xmath0 , at least in the 1pn calculations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "form ] , we give a brief review on the full relativistic treatment of rotating relativistic stars and then reformulate the rotational constraint imposed by the barotropic equation of state .",
    "next , we use the standard 1pn metric and show that the rotational constraint can be solved analytically .",
    "we then derive the equations of motion determining the structure of a star to 1pn order . in section  [ sec : num ]",
    ", we generalize the self - consistent field method of smith and centrella  @xcite so that it can be used to compute the structure of a star to 1pn order . in section  [",
    "sec : results ] , we apply the numerical method to construct neutron star models resulting from the collapse of the o - ne - mg white dwarfs we studied in paper  ii and compare them with the corresponding newtonian models . finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "in this section , we first give a brief review on the full relativistic treatment of rotating relativistic stars and then reformulate the rotational constraint imposed by the barotropic equation of state ( eos ) in section  [ sec : fullgr ] .",

    "we want to construct the nascent neutron stars resulting from the aic of rotating white dwarfs . as in paper",
    "i , we make the following assumptions on the aic and the collapsed stars .",
    "first , we assume the collapse is axisymmetric .",
    "hence the spacetime , albeit dynamical , has an axial killing vector field @xmath21 .",
    "second , we neglect viscosity and assume a perfect fluid stress - energy tensor @xmath23 where @xmath16 is the energy density in the fluid s rest frame ; @xmath24 is pressure and @xmath25 is the fluid s four - velocity , normalized so that @xmath26 .",
    "third , we assume that the collapsed objects can be described by a barotropic eos , i.e.  @xmath27 .",
    "fourth , we assume there is no meridional circulation in the equilibrium state of the collapsed objects , i.e. , the spacetime is _ nonconvective _ or _ circular _  @xcite . in other words , the fluid s four - velocity can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the timelike killing vector field of the spacetime of the collapsed star , @xmath30 is the speed of light , @xmath19 is the time component of the four - velocity , and @xmath10 is the rotational angular velocity measured by an inertial observer at infinity .",
    "finally , we assume that no material is ejected from the star during and after the collapse .",
    "hence the total baryon rest mass @xmath31 and the total angular momentum @xmath32 are conserved .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the baryon number density in the fluid s rest frame .",
    "it follows from the baryon number conservation law @xmath34 and conservation of energy - momentum @xmath35 that ( see , e.g. , chapter  22 of ref .",

    "we have generalized the self - consistent field method so that it can be used to compute models of differentially rotating stars to 1pn order with a specified angular momentum distribution @xmath0 .",
    "we also applied this new method to construct models of nascent neutron stars resulting from the collapse of massive o - ne - mg white dwarfs we studied in paper  ii and compare them with the corresponding newtonian models .",
