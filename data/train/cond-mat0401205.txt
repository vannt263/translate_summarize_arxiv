    "the structure of amorphous semiconductors is well represented by continuous random network ( crn ) model introduced by zachariasen  @xcite 70 years ago .",
    "the crn model has the simplicity that each of the atoms should satisfy its local bonding requirements and should have as small strain as possible in the network which is generally characterized by having a narrow bond angle as well as bond length distribution . in spite of its apparent simplicity ,",
    "the structural modeling of high quality tetrahedral amorphous semiconductors appears to be quite difficult .",
    "there have been many models of amorphous silicon  @xcite proposed in the last 30 years which include from very simple hand - built model of polk  @xcite , computer generated periodic network model of guttman  @xcite to the complex model of wooten , winer and weaire ( www )  @xcite , but most of these models have some limitations in one way or another in describing the true nature of the amorphous state .",
    "the last method , the so called _ sillium _ approach of www , is based on the strategy of randomizing and relaxing the network is so far the most successful method of producing minimally strained crn .",
    "the algorithm , in its modified form developed by djordjevi@xmath0 et.al .",
    "@xcite and barkema and mousseau  @xcite , can produce a crn which is comparable to experimental results and is capable of producing a clean band gap without any defect states in the gap .    in this paper",
    "we develop a different approach to model amorphous semiconductors known as reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) simulation  @xcite .",
    "our primary objective is to produce structural configurations that are consistent with experimental data but at the same time we go one step further to generate realistic configurations for comparison with models obtained via other routes .",
    "we emphasize that producing realistic models ( meaning models which agree with all experiments ) requires more than spatial pair correlations , and identify additional constraints which lead to realistic models .",
    "the existing rmc models of amorphous semiconductors are found to be inadequate and fail to produce some of the basic experimental features of amorphous tetrahedral semiconductors .",
    "gereben & pusztai  @xcite have carried out rmc simulation of tetrahedral semiconductors using a number of models ranging from completely disordered configuration to randomized diamond structure .",
    "although a certain degree of tetrahedral character in the bond angle distribution was reflected in their work , most of the models show an unphysical peak in bond angle distribution around @xmath1 .",
    "the work of walters and newport  @xcite on amorphous germanium made some progress toward getting the correct bond angle distribution , but the number of 3-fold coordinated atoms are quite high in their model and in absence of any discussion on local strain and electronic properties it is difficult to say how reliable their models are when it comes looking at the electronic properties .",
    "a developing area where rmc may be applied successfully is for modeling amorphous materials exhibiting medium - range order ( mro ) .",
    "such mro is characterized by the existence of @xmath2 scale structure .",
    "recent developments in fluctuation electron microscopy ( fem)@xcite and its application on amorphous germanium and silicon have indicated that computer generated crn model of these materials lack the characteristic signature of mro .",
    "since rmc is based on experimental data , it provides a promising scheme to model amorphous materials having medium - range order by including the experimentally measured fem signal as input data to augment pair correlations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ basic ]",
    ", we briefly mention the basic philosophy of reverse monte carlo modeling and some of its salient features .",
    "this is followed by role of constraints in rmc modeling in section [ model ] where we illustrate how a set of judiciously chosen constraints can be used to construct a reliable model of amorphous silicon .",
    "finally we compare our results with those obtained from earlier rmc models and a model obtained via www algorithm .",
    "the rmc method has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . here",
    "we briefly outline the basic philosophy of rmc . at the very basic level , rmc is a technique for generating structural configurations based on experimental data .",
    "the logic is very appealing : any model of a complex material worthy of further study should , at a minimum , agree with what is known ( that is , the experiments ) . by construction",
    ", the rmc scheme enforces this ( and for contrast , a molecular dynamics simulation may not ) . in an ideal implementation",
    ", one should find a model agreeing with _ all _ known information , but this is not easy to accomplish , though we make some progress below .",
    "the approach was originally developed by mcgreevy & pusztai  @xcite for liquid and glassy materials for lack of different routes to explore experimental data but in recent years progress has been made toward modeling crystalline systems as well  @xcite . starting with a suitable configuration ,",
    "atoms are displaced randomly using the periodic boundary condition until the input experimental data ( either the structure factor or the radial distribution function ) match with the data obtained from the generated configuration .",
    "this is achieved by minimizing a cost function which consists of either structure factor or radial distribution function along with some appropriately chosen constraints to restrict the search space .",
    "consider a system having @xmath3 number of atoms with periodic boundary condition .",
    "one can construct a generalized cost function for an arbitrary configuration by writing : [ eq - cost1 ] = _ j=1^k _ i=1^m _ i^j \\{f^j_e(q_i)- f^j_c(q_i)}^2 + _",
    "l=1^l _ l p_l    where @xmath4 is related to the uncertainty associated with the determination of experimental data points as well as the relative weight factor for each set of different experimental data .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 is the appropriate generalized variable associated with experimental data @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the penalty function associated with each constraint .",
    "for example , in case of radial distribution function and structure factor , @xmath5 has the dimension of length and inverse length respectively . in order to avoid the atoms getting too close to each other , a certain cut - off distance is also imposed which is typically of the order of interatomic spacing . in rmc modeling ,",
    "this is usually obtained from the radial distribution function by fourier transform of the measured structure factor .",
    "this is equivalent to adding a hard sphere potential cut - off in the system which prevents the catastrophic build up of potential energy .    in spite of the fact that rmc has been applied to many different types of systems  liquid , glasses , polymer and magnetic materials , questions",
    "are often raised about the reliability of results obtained from rmc simulation .",
    "the method has never been accepted without some degree of controversy and the most popular criticism is the lack of unique solution from rmc .",
    "rmc can produce multiple configurations having the same pair correlation function .",
    "this lack of uniqueness , however , is not surprising , since usually only the pair correlation function or structure factor is used in modeling the structure , while there exists an infinite hierarchy of higher order correlation functions carrying independent structural information are neglected .",
    "in other words , rmc samples from the space of all models consistent with some limited body of data  in its simplest form ( analyzing a single experiment ) rmc is an ideal gauge of how _ non - specific _ the data is with respect to identification of an atomistic model . if the modeler possesses _ a priori _ information independent of that implicit in the experiment being fit to , it is necessary to add this information to the modeling in some fashion to receive a model in joint agreement with the experiment and the additional information .",
    "we begin by including the minimal information that is necessary to model a configuration of @xmath8-si . in so doing , we use the radial distribution function obtained from a high quality model of amorphous silicon .",
    "this latter model was generated by barkema and mousseau  @xcite using a modified form of www algorithm  @xcite having bond angle distribution close to @xmath9 with 100% 4-fold coordination .",
    "in addition to this rdf , we also impose the conditions that the average bond angle of all the triplets si - si - si should be near @xmath10 and the corresponding root mean square deviation should be no less than @xmath9 .",
    "the number of 4-fold coordinated atoms is driven to a specified value during the simulation by including a constraint on the average coordination number .",
    "it is to be noted that while there is no limit to the number of constraints that can be included in the system , there is no guarantee that mere inclusion of more constraints will necessarily give better results .",
    "forcing a completely random configuration with too many competing constraints may cause the configuration to be trapped in the local minimum of the function @xmath11 and may prevent the system from exploring a large part of the search space . by adding only the essential constraints that describe the chemical and geometrical nature of the bonding correctly , eq.[eq - cost1 ] can be written as :    & = & _ i=1^m _ 1\\{f_e(x_i)- f_c(x_i)}^2 + & + & _ 2 ( _ 0 - ) ^2 + & + & _ 3 ( _ 0 - ) ^2 + & + & _ 4 \\{1 - ( x - x_c ) } + & + & _ 5 \\{_0 - } ^2 [ eq - cost2 ]    where ,    & = & _ i\\{j , k } _ ijk + & = &    in eq.[eq - cost2 ] , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the average angle and the rms deviation while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the current and proposed concentration of the 4-fold coordinated atoms .",
    "it is important to note that each of the terms in eq.[eq - cost2 ] is non - negative , and should decrease ideally to zero during the course of minimization .",
    "structure factor obtained from a rmc ( + ) model containing 500 atoms of @xmath8-si .",
    "the solid line is obtained from a www sample of identical size and number density of atoms .",
    ", width=326,height=326 ]    since the cost of energy associated with the bond length relaxation is more than the bond angle relaxation , atomic arrangements with large bond angle distribution but having correct rdf frequently result .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath16 to @xmath17 , for the different terms in eq.[eq - cost2 ] can be chosen appropriately to minimize this effect .",
    "in general the coefficients @xmath18 are constant during the course of simulation but the minimization procedure can be slightly accelerated by making them vary in such a way that the contribution from each of the term are of the same order during the course of simulation .",
    "the coefficient @xmath19 is usually assigned a large value in order to include a hard sphere cut - off as mentioned earlier so that no two particles can come closer to @xmath20 while the coefficient @xmath21 maintains the number of 4-fold coordinated atoms to a specified value . in rmc simulation of amorphous tetrahedral semiconductors",
    "one usually encounters the problem of having a pronounced peak at @xmath1 .",
    "this peak is a characteristic feature of unconstrained rmc simulation and is due to the formation of equilateral triangles by three atoms . in the work of gereben and pusztai  @xcite",
    ", attempts were made to overcome this difficulty by constraining the bond angle distribution as well as by making an initial configuration which is 100% 4-fold obtained from a diamond lattice .",
    "the resulting structure is , however , found to be unstable and on relaxation using a suitable potential , the configuration tends to get back toward the starting structure , i.e. , randomized diamond in this case  @xcite .",
    "structure factor obtained for a 500-atom model of @xmath8-si from rmc ( solid line ) and the experiment of laaziri et al . as indicated in the figure .",
    ", width=326,height=326 ]    in the approach of walter and newport  @xcite , the initial random configuration was examined and any `` triples '' , i.e. , three atoms forming an equilateral triangle was removed before the beginning of rmc fit . by selective removal of such unwanted triplets",
    ", they have been able to generate configuration of @xmath8-ge without having a peak at @xmath1 .",
    "the approach that we have taken in our work is more general and starts with a completely random configuration .",
    "this eliminates , in the first place , any possible local ordering that may exist in the starting structure ( e.g. , randomized diamond structure retains the memory of tetrahedral ordering ) .",
    "furthermore , we have not included or excluded any special configuration in our starting structure , e.g. , three atoms forming an equilateral triangle .",
    "based on experimental consideration , we have included only the key features of amorphous tetrahedral semiconductors  an average bond angle of @xmath10 having rms deviation of @xmath9 which is consistent with the rdf obtained from a www relaxed model used in our calculation .",
    "for the 500-atom model reported in this work , we have chosen a cubic box of length 21.18 which corresponds to number density 0.0526 atom / @xmath22 .",
    "the initial configuration is generated randomly so that no two atoms can come closer to 2.0 .",
    "the configuration is then relaxed by moving the atoms to minimize the cost function @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to applying standard monte carlo moves in which a single or a group of atoms is randomly displaced , a variety of monte carlo moves have been implemented in our work .",
    "for example , in one of such moves , a 3-fold or 5-fold atom is selected and the nearest neighbor distance is examined . if the distance is greater than 2.7 , the neighboring atom is displaced in order to bring the distance within a radius of 2.7 .",
    "the bond angle distribution functions ( badf ) for 500-atom @xmath8-si from constrained rmc ( dashed line ) and www model ( solid line ) .",
    "the rms deviation for the models are @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    ", width=326,height=326 ]    the maximum displacement of a monte carlo move is limited to 0.2 - 0.4 throughout the simulation .",
    "since we are interested in the electronic structure as well , we confine ourselves within a reasonable system size for studying the generated structure using a first principles density functional hamiltonian .",
    "the density functional calculations were performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) using the local basis first principles code siesta  @xcite .",
    "we have used a non self - consistent version of density functional theory based on the linearization of the kohn - sham equation by harris functional approximation  @xcite along with the parameterization of perdew and zunger  @xcite for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the results for the model including all the constraints are presented in figs.[cstr]-[edos ] . since the structure factor is generally considered to be more sensitive to an arbitrary small change in the atomic positions than the radial distribution function , we have plotted the structure factors for the constrained rmc and www model in fig.[cstr ] .",
    "it is evident from fig.[cstr ] that the agreement between the rmc and www model is very good both for small and large values of q. in order to further justify the credibility of our model , we have plotted in fig.[str2 ] the structure factor from the experiment of laaziri et.al@xcite along with the same obtained from our rmc model .",
    "once again we find that the agreement between the structure factor from rmc and the experimental results is quite good except for the few points near the first peak .",
    "it is very tempting to think this deviation as a finite size effect coming from the finiteness of our model .",
    "we have therefore calculated the structure factor for www models containing 300 to 4096 atoms of si but the deviation continues to remain .",
    "holender and morgan  @xcite also observed similar deviation near the first peak in their work with a much larger model containing 13824 atoms which was compared with the experimental data obtained by fortner and lannin  @xcite .     the electronic density of states ( edos ) of 500-atom model of @xmath8-si obtained from rmc simulation described in the text .",
    "the fermi level is at e=0 .",
    ", width=321,height=321 ]    in fig.[cadf ] , we have plotted the bond angle distributions ( badf ) for both the rmc and www model . as we have discussed in section ii , the radial distribution function or structure factor can not alone provide all the necessary information that are needed to characterize an atomic configuration obtained from a reverse monte carlo simulation .",
    "a further characterization beyond pair correlation function is therefore vital and necessitates the need for getting some idea about the 3-body correlation function .",
    "it is clear from the fig.[cadf ] that the distribution obtained from the rmc model follows the tetrahedral character observed in amorphous semiconductors . the average bond angle in this case is found to be @xmath25 with rms deviation of @xmath23 .",
    "an important aspect of the bond angle distribution in fig.[cadf ] is that most of the angles are lying between @xmath26-@xmath27 compared to @xmath28-@xmath29 in www case .",
    "we emphasize at this point that the earlier works on modeling amorphous tetrahedral semiconductors using rmc predicted a much wider bond angle distributions .",
    "gereben and pusztai  @xcite have observed a pronounced , unphysical peak at @xmath1 except for the model starting with diamond structure while walters and newport  @xcite have reported a bond angle distribution of @xmath8-ge which is as wide as @xmath1-@xmath30 .",
    "it is an important development here that by adding three more constraints ( @xmath31 , and @xmath19 ) we have achieved a significantly improved results .",
    "both the radial and the bond angle distribution functions reported here are at par with the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulation and is comparable to those obtained from www model .",
    "the fact that the inclusion of these two constraints leads to a significant improvement is not surprising . for a large continuous random network ( crn )",
    "model of amorphous tetrahedral semiconductor , one can approximate the bond angle distribution as nearly gaussian  @xcite .",
    "this approximated gaussian distribution can defined by the first two moments of the distribution function . by specifying these two moments as constraints in eq.[eq - cost2 ] , we correctly describe the tetrahedral bonding geometry of the atoms which along with the radial distribution function produces a configuration more realistic than those obtained from models based on rdf or structure factor only .",
    "this suggests that in addition to the radial distribution of the atoms , one needs to include some relevant information about the nature of 3-body correlation among the atoms to construct a realistic configuration .",
    "having studied the radial and bond angle distribution we now address the electronic density of states calculations .",
    "while the width of the bond angle distribution function ( badf ) and the structure factor together indeed gives some idea about the quality of the model , some of the features e.g. , the existence of spectral gaps and the position of defects states in the spectrum can be studied by looking at the electronic density of states only .",
    "the structure obtained from rmc simulation is first relaxed using the density functional code siesta and is found to be close to an energy minimum in the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "this is an important test for determining the stability of the structure obtained from rmc simulation and as far as we are concerned almost all earlier works on rmc have completely neglected this issue . in fig.[edos ] , we have plotted the electronic density of states ( edos ) for the constrained model .",
    "the edos appears with all the characteristic features of @xmath8-si with the exception of a clean gap in the spectrum .",
    "this behavior is not unexpected in view of the fact that 88% of the total atoms are found to be 4-fold coordinated with an average coordination number 3.85 .",
    "the presence of the defect states makes the gap noisy and at the same time the use of lda underestimates the size of the gap .",
    "this edos is in significantly better agreement with optical measurements than conventional rmc models with much higher defect concentrations and spurious bond angles .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the average coordination number from our model is very close to the experimental value of 3.88 reported by laaziri et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a model of amorphous silicon based on reverse monte carlo simulation .",
    "one of the novel features of our model is to start with a completely random structure and then to relax toward a realistic configuration by adding a number of physically relevant constraints .",
    "the characteristic features of the tetrahedral bonding are taken into account by adding constraints on average bond angle and its deviation from the mean while the number of 4-fold coordinated atoms is maintained at a specified value by further use of a constraint on average coordination number .",
    "the radial and the bond angle distribution obtained from our model is found to be in excellent agreement with a high quality crn model produced by www algorithm .",
    "we have also compared the structure factor with the experimental data obtained by laaziri et al . and observed a reasonably good agreement . by relaxing the model using the first principles density function code siesta",
    ", we find that the model is close to the energy minimum for lda and is stable .",
    "the electronic density of states ( edos ) obtained from our model contains all the essential feature of amorphous silicon including a signature of the band gap .",
    "although the model does not produce a clean gap in the spectrum , the quality of the edos is at par with models obtained from molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "our rmc algorithm presents a significant improvement on previous rmc studies and makes it possible to compare for the first time , albeit qualitatively , the structural and electronic properties of rmc models with its www counterpart .",
    "we expect that further developments toward this direction will eventually make rmc as an useful modeling tool incorporating experimental information and can be used effectively without any criticisms in modeling complex materials .",
