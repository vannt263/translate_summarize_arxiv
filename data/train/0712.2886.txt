    "recently proposed self - consistent quasiparticle model for quark gluon plasma ( qqgp ) @xcite is extended to 2-flavor ( 2-f ) , 3-flavor ( 3-f ) and ( 2 + 1)-flavor ( ( 2 + 1)-f ) qgp and is found to explain very well the lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) qcd results @xcite .",
    "our model differs from other qqgp models @xcite in many aspects .",
    "firstly , our formulation is based on the standard statistical mechanics ( sm ) @xcite , without the need of any reformulation of sm @xcite . here",
    "we start from energy density ( @xmath0 ) and particle number density ( @xmath1 ) , well defined in grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) and then all other thermodynamic ( td ) quantities , including pressure , are derived from @xmath0 , @xmath1 and using the standard td relations .",
    "hence , there is no td inconsistency in our model @xcite .",
    "secondly , the thermal mass of quasiparticle , in our model , is assumed to be function of density which in term depends on thermal mass and hence one need to solve it self - consistently @xcite with the requirements that at high temperature thermal masses go to that of qcd perturbative results .",
    "note that all other qqgp models @xcite used qcd perturbative thermal masses which is appropriate to ideal system , because one uses ideal thermal propagators in these calculations , but the system is non - ideal . only at high temperature",
    "it may be approximated to ideal system .",
    "thirdly , there is only single system dependent adjustable parameter and gives a surprisingly good fit to lgt results .",
    "we will discuss and compare 3 models , in our formulation , based on 3 forms of thermal mass .",
    "model - i is based on qcd perturbative thermal mass without self - consistent calculation .",
    "model - ii is based on our self - consistent calculation , using the simpler , approximate dispersion relation ( @xmath2 vs @xmath3 ) . in model - iii , we repeat the self - consistent calculations of model - ii , but using the dispersion relation of hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) resumed qcd perturbation theory .",
    "we will see that the results of model - i , is not satisfactory , but results improve considerably as we go from model - i to model - iii , because of our self - consistent calculations .",
    "as in any qqgp model , here also , we assume that the thermal properties of interacting real particles are modeled by non - interacting quasiparticles with additional thermal mass which depends on thermodynamic quantities due to collective properties of the medium .",
    "following the the standard sm , in gce , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the only td quantities , defined as the average of the energy and the number of particles .",
    "all other td quantities , including pressure , need to be derived @xcite . in usual sm ,",
    "the masses of particles are zero or constant and hence one can derive the expression for the pressure from @xmath0 , using td relations , and find that the pressure is equal to the logarithm of the partition function @xcite .",
    "but , here in qgp it is not true , since the thermal mass depends on td quantities which in turn depends on thermal mass through a functional relationship and hence whole problem need to be solved self - consistently .",
    "the energy density is @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the degeneracy and @xmath6 refers to bosons and fermions .",
    "@xmath7 is the fugacity .",
    "note that , here we have assumed that the whole thermal energy is used to excite quasiparticles and hence the vacuum energy contribution is neglected .",
    "a detailed discussion on the vacuum energy contribution and td consistency relation was commented in ref .",
    "similarly , the number density is @xmath8 single particle energy or @xmath2 depends on thermal masses and momentum @xmath3 .",
    "the exact expression for @xmath2 may be obtained by solving the approximate dispersion relation , obtained using htl calculations @xcite , @xmath9 for gluons and @xmath10 for quarks , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are plasma frequencies related to thermal masses . both of them are , in general , functions of temperature ( @xmath13 ) and chemical potential ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "first , we consider qgp system with @xmath15 and at the end with @xmath16 . above dispersion relation",
    "may be further approximated to a simpler form , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for gluons and quarks respectively , valid at high temperatures .",
    "the thermal masses are defined as @xmath19 respectively , for massless particles . for massive quark with mass @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21 may be modified as @xcite @xmath22     as a function of @xmath23 from the model - i and lattice results @xcite ( symbols ) for pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp.,width=453,height=302 ]     as a function of @xmath23 from the model - i and lattice results @xcite ( symbols ) for pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp.,width=453,height=302 ]    first , let us consider our model - i where , just like in other qqgp models , we take @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the qcd coupling constant and @xmath27 is the number of flavors .",
    "these are perturbative results , valid for very high temperature , but are modified to take account of non - perturbative effects by using appropriate running coupling constant , @xmath28 .",
    "different authors @xcite use different phenomenological models of @xmath29 and even thermal masses , with few adjustable parameters . here ,",
    "in our model - i , we use 2-loop approximate running coupling constant , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the only one adjustable parameter in our model .",
    "results are presented in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "the general expression for the energy density is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the degeneracy of gluons and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the effective number of flavors corresponding to light quarks ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and strange quark respectively .",
    "@xmath38 for massless quarks and is less than @xmath27 for quarks with finite mass @xcite .",
    "the pressure is obtained from the thermodynamic relation @xcite @xmath39 on integration with one integration constant which may be chosen such that @xmath40 , the stefan - boltzmann limit , as @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is difficult to adopt it in our numerical work and hence we fix it at @xmath42 to lgt results .",
    "to improve model - i , in model - ii , we replace the perturbative expression for plasma frequencies , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wp ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : mf ] ) , by density dependent expression , @xmath43 for gluons and @xmath44 which is motivated from similar work in relativistic electron - positron plasma @xcite where we know that the plasma frequency , at relativistic limit , is proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "we fix the constant of proportionality @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 by demanding that as @xmath41 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 goes to the corresponding perturbative results .",
    "since now thermal masses depends on density , the expression for density becomes a functional , given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 which depends on @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .     as a function of @xmath23 from the model - ii and lattice results @xcite ( symbols ) for pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp.,width=453,height=302 ]     as a function of @xmath23 from the model - ii and lattice results @xcite ( symbols ) for pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp.,width=453,height=302 ]",
    "so we need to solve density equation self - consistently to get the density and then we may calculate plasma frequencies which may be used to evaluate @xmath0 , @xmath56 and other td quantities using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eg ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : td ] )",
    ". it may be convenient to work with @xmath57 for gluons , @xmath58 for quarks and @xmath59 for antiquarks , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is the degeneracy of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "it is easy to see that at high temperature @xmath64 and hence @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath15 systems , appropriate to ideal plasma .",
    "this high temperature limit is taken to evaluate the coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 by comparing with perturbative results for plasma frequencies .",
    "results are presented in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 .     as a function of @xmath23 from the model - iii and lattice results @xcite ( symbols ) for pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp.,width=453,height=302 ]     as a function of @xmath23 from the model - iii and lattice results @xcite ( symbols ) for pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp.,width=453,height=302 ]    next we further improve model - ii by using the full htl approximate dispersion relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : drg ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : drq ] ) , instead of the approximate dispersion relation .",
    "first , one need to solve htl dispersion relation for @xmath2 and then carry out the self - consistent calculations as done in model - ii .",
    "results are presented in fig . 5 and fig .",
    "we see that there is only a marginal improvement , especially near to @xmath67 , as we go from model - ii to model - iii .",
    "hence the dispersion relation of model - ii is a good approximation to that of htl calculations .",
    "so far we have discussed qgp systems with @xmath15 and found to explain lgt results very well using our self - consistent model .",
    "let us apply our model to the system with @xmath16 . for @xmath16 , thermal masses and running coupling constant",
    "need to be modified as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in our self - consistent model we demand that as @xmath41 , @xmath68 goes to qcd perturbative @xmath69 dependent functions , @xmath70 the running coupling constant may be modified by replacing @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ls ] ) by @xmath72 using the results of schneider @xcite .",
    "similar @xmath14 dependent modifications also used by letessier , rafelski @xcite , but instead of @xmath73 factor they used @xmath74 which also gives similar results except near @xmath75 .",
    "first , we solve the density equations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fq ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqb ] ) , for quarks and antiquarks self - consistently and then subtract each other to get the net quark density @xmath76 . note that now the asymptotic values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , needed to evaluate @xmath12 , are not @xmath79 , but given by @xmath80 and @xmath81 and both the expressions approach @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "results of our model , using model - ii , is plotted in fig .",
    "7 for @xmath84 and fits lgt results without the need of any new parameters and @xmath31 is fixed earlier for @xmath85 system .     as a function of @xmath23 from the model - ii and lattice results @xcite ( symbols ) for 2-f qgp.,width=453,height=302 ]",
    "the analysis using model - i is straight forward and the parameter @xmath86 , is adjusted to get the best fit to lgt results on pressure . using this @xmath87",
    "we evaluate other td quantities like @xmath0 .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath87 are 0.35 , 0.4 , 0.2 , 0.2 for pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp respectively and the results are plotted in fig.1 and fig .",
    "2 . in the case of massive quarks ,",
    "effective number of quarks flavors , @xmath88 , is less than @xmath27 and may be obtained from the ref . @xcite as @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the lgt data @xcite for the systems with finite flavor were multiplied by a factor @xmath91 to take into account of the uncertainties in the continuum extrapolation .",
    "the fit to lgt results are not satisfactory for @xmath92 , but fits well at higher temperature as it should .",
    "note that the same model was also used by other qqgp studies @xcite and obtained very good fit to lgt results , but adjusting 3 or more parameters , where as here we have only single adjustable parameter . in the case of model - ii , we solve the equation for density , self - consistently and use it to evaluate the pressure .",
    "again , the parameter @xmath87 is adjusted to fit lgt results on pressure and then the energy density is evaluated . now",
    "the fitted values of @xmath87 are higher and are 0.7 , 0.6 , 0.35 , and 0.45 for pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp respectively and the fit to lgt results , fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 , improves a lot compared to model - i .",
    "similar self - consistent calculations is used in model - iii using the htl dispersion relation , and the results are plotted in fig . 5 and fig .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath87 are 0.74 , 0.68 , 0.4 and 0.55 for pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp respectively .",
    "we see further improvement in the results , especially near @xmath67 , and the values of @xmath87 are slightly higher .",
    "these values of @xmath87 may give better values of @xmath31 , since model - iii is more accurate than model - i and model - ii .",
    "in fig . 7 , results of our model - ii for 2-f qgp system at finite @xmath14 is compared with lgt results for quark density and reasonably good fit is obtained without any new parameter . of course , very close to @xmath93 and for @xmath94 , our quasiparticle model , which is based on plasma collective effects , may not explain the lgt results .",
    "one may need to include the effects of vacuum energy or effects of hadron resonance gas as done in ref .",
    "here we have studied the thermodynamics of pure gauge , 2-f , 3-f and ( 2 + 1)-f qgp systems with our newly developed , self - consistent quasiparticle model using htl approximate dispersion relation and it s approximate simpler dispersion relation . by adjusting single system dependent adjustable parameter , @xmath95",
    ", we obtained a remarkable good fits to lgt results , without the need of too many adjustable parameters as required by other qqgp models @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we have also studied these systems without using the self - consistent calculations , but fails to fit lgt results for @xmath96 . from our calculation on @xmath16 system ,",
    "if lgt results are true , we need further more accurate dispersion relation than htl approximate results to improve our model",
    ". it may be interesting to adopt this idea of self - consistent calculations in finite temperature qcd and solve the qcd at finite temperature without the need of qqgp .",
