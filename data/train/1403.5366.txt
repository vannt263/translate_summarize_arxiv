    "isolated quantum systems evolve unitarily according to the schrdinger equation . when the quantum system is immersed in a canonical heat bath with a temperature @xmath0 , after a relaxation time long enough",
    ", it would forget all the initial state information and achieve a canonical state due to the weak interaction with the environment .",
    "this process is called canonical thermalization @xcite .",
    "now we consider the thermalization process for a composite system , which contains several subsystems , where only a small subsystem is contacted with environment [ fig.[fig - demo](a ) ] . we show that if the energy level structure of the composite system is _ connected _ , i.e.",
    ", there exists direct or indirect quantum transitions between any two levels of the system , the whole system would also be thermalized to its canonical thermal state with the bath temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the contact of a small part would lead to the global thermalization of the whole system , which is the same as the case that all the subsystems contact with the same heat bath .",
    "we call this process _ synchro - thermalization . _",
    "especially , we consider the case that the interactions between each subsystems are non - demolition type , where the interaction coupling does not change the energy of one of the subsystems @xcite",
    ". we will explicitly give the condition when the whole composite system can be synchro - thermalized .",
    "on the first sight , this result seems rather counter - intuitive , especially when we consider the case that the rest part of the composite system , which does not contact with the environment , may be quite large and even tend to be infinite . to solve this puzzle , we consider an example where an @xmath1-level system interacts with a set of @xmath2 harmonic oscillators via non - demolition coupling .",
    "we show that the relaxation rate is suppressed by a multi - franck - condon factor @xcite : when the degrees of freedom become large , the speed of global relaxation to the thermal state would tend to be zero .",
    "that means , the larger the composite system is , the harder it is to thermalize it .",
    "and we call this effect the franck - condon blockade @xcite of thermalization .",
    "we arrange our paper as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we give a review on the general situation of thermalization .",
    "in sec.iii , we show the connectivity and thermalization of composite systems . in sec.iv",
    ", we discuss a specific model where the composite system consists an @xmath1-level system and an harmonic oscillator . in sec.v",
    ", we show how the thermalization rate is blockaded by the franck - condon factor when the scale of the subsystem free of contact become large .",
    "finally we draw summary in sec.vi .",
    "_ _     contacts with a heat bath with temperature @xmath0 , while @xmath3 does not .",
    "( b ) both parts contact with the heat bath directly . ]    in order to conveniently use the notations in discussions about the synchro - thermalization for a composite system , we review some previous result about the thermalization of a general system first .",
    "we write down the hamiltonian for the system in the eigen basis @xmath4 as follows , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the corresponding eigen energy .",
    "the system is contacted with a heat bath via the interaction @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are operators of the system and the heat bath . in the interaction picture of @xmath10 , the system operator @xmath11 is decomposed according to the oscillation frequencies , and @xmath12 corresponds to the spectral decomposition of system operator @xmath13 with respect to the eigen basis @xmath4 .    with the born - markovian approximation , the master equation for this composite system @xcite , @xmath14 is used to describe the open system dynamics .",
    "here we omitted the lamb shift term which has no effect on the thermalization .",
    "the generalized relaxation rates , @xmath15 are defined by the bath correlation functions @xmath16 .    according to the born approximation , the heat bath keeps unchanged , i.e. , @xmath17 $ ] . thus the above finite temperature bath correlation functions @xmath16 satisfy the kubo - martin - schwinger condition @xcite @xmath18 it is noticed that the generalized relaxation rates @xmath19 satisfy the following relation , @xmath20 which is the key point to lead to detailed balance equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the population of the system , denoted as @xmath21 , is decoupled from that of the off - diagonal terms @xmath22 , and can be described by the following pauli master equation ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the time - independent probability transition rate from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "it follows from eq.([eq : rate ] ) that the transition rates satisfies , @xmath28    the above derivations have been given in many literatures @xcite .",
    "here we focus our attention on the transition structure of the energy levels induced by the coupling to the heat bath .",
    "we would show that whether the whole system can be thermalized to its unique thermal state is determined by the _ connectivity _ of the transition structure of the energy levels .",
    "if @xmath29 , there exists direct probability transition between the two levels @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath31 , though there is no direct transition between @xmath27 and @xmath26 , the indirect transitions still may happen which is mediated by some other levels @xmath32 , that is , the probability transition between @xmath27 and @xmath26 can be completed by a mediating path @xmath33@xmath34 .",
    "here we use the concept of _ connectivity _ in topology to describe such transition structure of the energy levels .",
    "we say the two levels @xmath27 and @xmath26 are _ path - connected _ , or _ connected by a path _ , if and only if there exists a _ path _ , which is represented by an ordered series @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for any @xmath39 .",
    "we say the energy structure of the whole system is _ connected _ , if and only if any two energy levels are path - connected [ fig.[fig - connect](a ) ] , otherwise , we say the energy structure is _ disconnected _ [ fig.[fig - connect](b)]__. _ _    _ _        next , we study the thermalization of the system with the consideration of topology mentioned above . according to eq.([eq : ratio ] ) , the equilibrium steady state requires that @xcite @xmath40=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath29 , i.e. , there exists direct transition between @xmath27 and @xmath26 , so that @xmath41 if @xmath42 , but @xmath27 and @xmath26 are connected by a path , denoted as @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , with the same reason as above , we have @xmath43 therefore , when the energy structure of the system is connected , the above proportion series includes all the energy levels and that gives the canonical state @xmath44    when the energy level structure is not connected , but the whole hilbert space can be decomposed into two connected subspaces @xmath45 and @xmath46 [ fig.[fig - connect](b ) ] , e.g. , spanned by @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , we have two independent series ,    @xmath49    but we can not determine further relation between the two series , which should be determined from the initial state .",
    "denoting @xmath50 as the probability projected into the subspace @xmath51 from the initial state , it can be verified that @xmath52 is the steady state , where @xmath53 can be regarded as the partial `` thermal state '' for the connected subspace @xmath51 .",
    "it follows from eq.([eq : partial - thermal ] ) that part of the initial state information of the system can be preserved if the energy level structure is not connected .",
    "this is different from the connected case where all the initial state information is erased and the system is fully thermalized in the steady state .",
    "now we summarize the above results about the thermalization process as the following proposition .",
    "* proposition : * _ if the energy level structure of the system is connected , the system can be thermalized to its canonical thermal state , when it contacts with a equilibrium heat bath . _",
    "now we study the synchro - thermalization for a composite system , which consists two subsystems @xmath54 and @xmath3 coupled with each other . according to the proposition in the last section , we need to study whether the energy level structure of the composite system is connected .",
    "generally , the hamiltonian for the whole system is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we denote the eigen state of @xmath58 , @xmath59 by @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the corresponding eigen energies .",
    "the hamiltonian of the composite system @xmath64 is diagonalized as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is usually some superposition of the product states @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the eigen energy of the composite system .    the subsystem @xmath54 contacts with a heat bath via the following interaction , @xmath70 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are operators of @xmath54 and the heat bath respectively .",
    "we suppose that @xmath3 does not contact with any heat bath directly .",
    "@xmath8 is expanded in the eigen basis of @xmath64 as @xmath71 .",
    "then the transition rate of the composite system becomes @xmath72    for example , we consider the case that @xmath54 is coupled with @xmath3 via the interaction of the non - demolition type , i.e. , @xmath73=0 $ ] , which means that the energy of @xmath54 does not change due to such interaction with @xmath3 in the absence of the environment . in this case , the eigen state of the composite system has the form of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the eigen state of the effective @xmath76-branch hamiltonian , @xmath77 of the subsystem @xmath3 . the original energy level @xmath78 is splitted into some sub levels @xmath79 due to the interaction .",
    "we can write down the transition rates of the composite system @xmath80    _ _        in most cases , @xmath81 dose not vanish , since the matrix elements @xmath82 do not vanish simultaneously when the indices @xmath83 take values in their domains . if the original energy levels @xmath84 of @xmath54 are connected in absence of the interaction with @xmath3 , the energy levels of the coupled composite system @xmath79 are still connected [ fig.[fig - sideband](a ) ] . therefore , according to the proposition in the last section , the whole composite system can be thermalized simultaneously to the canonical state @xmath85.\\ ] ]      now we present an example where the energy structure of the composite system is not connected .",
    "we consider the interaction hamiltonian @xmath86 of non - demolition type for both @xmath54 and @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath87=0 $ ] . in this case ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath3 do not exchange energy with each other , and @xmath86 has the form of @xmath88 and the eigenstates of @xmath89 are @xmath90 , with eigen energy @xmath91 .",
    "we obtain the transition rates of the composite system as @xmath92 notice that @xmath19 is usually a smooth function and varies quite slowly with @xmath93 , thus we have @xmath94 , which means that if the states @xmath84 and @xmath95 of @xmath54 are connected , the sideband states @xmath79 and @xmath96 are also connected , but @xmath79 and @xmath97 with @xmath98 are not , as demonstrated in fig.[fig - sideband](b ) . as a result , the energy structure of the composite system is not connected .",
    "according to the discussion in the last section , the final steady state of the composite system is @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and the probabilities @xmath101 are determined by the initial state .",
    "therefore , the whole composite system can not be synchro - thermalized to the canonical state in this situation .    for example",
    ", we consider a two - level qubit coupled to a resonator via the following hamiltonian , @xmath102 and we have @xmath103=[\\hat{h}_{\\mathrm{r}},\\,\\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{qr}}]=0 $ ] .",
    "this model can be implemented by a josephson qubit coupled to a superconducting resonator @xcite , or by an atom inside an optical cavity @xcite , in the dispersive regime with large detuning .",
    "the resonator is contact free , while the qubit is contacted with a heat bath via @xmath104 the eigen states of @xmath105 are @xmath106 .",
    "we can check that transition happens only between @xmath107 and @xmath108 , but does not happen between @xmath79 and @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "the energy structure of the composite system is disconnected as fig.[fig - sideband](b ) .",
    "for this system , the steady state is @xmath109 and @xmath101 is determined by the initial condition .",
    "in this section , we consider an example of this synchro - thermalization of a composite system consisting of an @xmath1-level system and an harmonic oscillator interacting with each other via non - demolition coupling .",
    "this composite system is described by the following hamiltonian ,    @xmath110    the @xmath1-level system is contacted with a heat bath .",
    "however , the harmonic oscillator does not couple to the environment directly . in the weak coupling limit , the heat bath could be modeled as a collection of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to the system @xcite . thus the @xmath1-level system exchanges energy with a boson bath via the following coupling , @xmath111 while the bath hamiltonian reads @xmath112 .",
    "here we make a simplification that @xmath113 only depend on the bath mode @xmath114 but not on the energy level @xmath115 , without loss of generality .",
    "the hamiltonian of the composite system eq.([eq : h - n+ho ] ) is diagonalized with the help of @xmath1 sets of displaced harmonic oscillator operators corresponding to the coupling with each energy level @xmath84 @xcite , @xmath116,\\label{eq : h - diag}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the displacement and energy shift respectively . and",

    "then we obtain the eigenstate of @xmath64 as @xmath121,\\ ] ] and eigen energy is @xmath122 here @xmath123 is the fock state of the original harmonic oscillator .",
    "we notice that each fock state @xmath123 is splitted into @xmath1 levels @xmath79 and forms a side - band structure caused by the coupling with the @xmath1-level system .    under the composite eigen basis @xmath124 of @xmath64 , the interaction hamiltonian with the bath @xmath125",

    "as shown as follows , the franck - condon factor suppresses the relaxation rates .    for the boson bath with the coupling spectrum @xmath129 the born - markovian approximation gives a master equation for the dynamics of this composite system @xcite , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the lindblad operator , and @xmath132 .",

    "for any two different levels @xmath79 and @xmath97 , where @xmath142 , we have @xmath143 .",
    "thus , under the mediation of the environment , the eigenstates of the composite system @xmath144 are connected . and the steady population of each two eigenstates satisfies the boltzmann distribution @xmath145 therefore",
    ", the whole composite state can be stabilized to its canonical thermal state @xmath146 $ ] when @xmath147 .",

    "_    , where we set @xmath148 . ]",
    "we have shown that for a composite system , a partial contact with a heat bath would cause global thermalization .",
    "it seems that even if the subsystem contacted with the heat bath is quite small while the rest part tends to be infinitely large , the whole system still can be thermalized globally . in this sense , the above result is rather counter - intuitive .    in order to solve this puzzle",

    "@xmath2 characterizes the scale of the subsystem free of the coupling to the bath .",
    "we will see that indeed the global thermalization rate of the whole system decreases rapidly when the scale of the whole composite system becomes large .",
    "we generalize the above example by using @xmath2 harmonic oscillators to replace the single one coupled to the @xmath1-level system .",

    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] comparing with the above case where @xmath3 only contains one harmonic oscillator , the only difference is that the thermalization rates are modified with a multi - franck - condon factor @xmath159    since each term in the product @xmath160 , when @xmath2 becomes large , the whole factor @xmath161 tends to vanish , and the thermalization rate approaches infinitesimal .",
    "that means , the speed of relaxation to the global thermal state is greatly suppressed by the multi - franck - condon factor due to the displacements of the fock states when the degrees of freedom is large .",

    "the @xmath1-level system is indeed decoupled from the @xmath2 oscillators , and the interaction term only contributes displacements to the oscillators .",
    "the thermalization speed returns to the case for the thermalization of the @xmath1-level system alone , regardless of the @xmath2 oscillators . in usual cases ,",
    "the multi - franck - condon factor gives rise to a exponential suppressing of the thermalization speed , which decays quite fast with the scale @xmath2 of the subsystem @xmath3 ( fig.[fig - max ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the synchro - thermalization for a composite system consisting of several subsystems , where only one of the subsystems is contacted with a canonical heat bath .",
    "it has been shown that the partial contact of one subsystem to the heat bath may stabilize the whole composite system to its canonical thermal state .",
    "we clarified that the conditions for the synchro - thermalization depends on the topology of the eigen - energy - level structure , i.e. , whether it is connected or not .",
    "we illustrated our main results with an @xmath1-level system coupled to several harmonic oscillators via the non - demolition way .",
    "our arguments lead to a puzzle that the whole composite system can be thermalized even if the scale of the subsystems free of contact tends to be infinitely large .",
    "this puzzle can be explicitly solved by our illustration with the franck - condon blockade mechanism .",
    "when the degrees of freedom of the composite system becomes large , the thermalization rate would approach zero .",
    "that is to say , it becomes more and more difficult to stabilize the composite system to its canonical thermal state .",
    "thus this effect of synchro - thermalization is not easy to be observed for large scale systems .",
