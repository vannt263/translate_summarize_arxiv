    "one of the interesting possibilities that arises within the landscape of possible sparticle mass hierarchies @xcite is that the gluino @xmath5 is the next to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) where neutralino dark matter produces the correct relic abundance of such matter consistent with the wmap observations @xcite .",
    "in fact , an analysis in the context of nonuniversal supergravity models ( nusugra ) reveals that the gluino nlsp model ( gnlsp ) arises in a significant part of the parameter space @xcite . amongst the various possible ways that the first four lightest sparticles may stack up in their mass hierarchy , one finds three such hierarchical mass patterns where the gluino is the nlsp @xcite which have been classified as models ( nusp13 , nusp14 , nusp15 ) @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath6 @xmath8 @xmath6 @xmath9 , where @xmath7 is the nlsp , but the @xmath10 lies close to the @xmath7 mass . ] as given in table([gnlsptable1 ] ) .",
    "we will often refer to this subclass of nusugra as the gnlsp class of models .",
    "although progress has been made on the parameter space of sparticle masses with coannhilating gluinos @xcite , collider and dark matter detection implications of the gnlsp models have yet to be explored in any great detail .",
    "thus in this work we give a dedicated analysis of such a model .",
    "since the gluino is a strongly interacting particle , an nlsp gluino will change drastically the typical sparticle analyses .",
    "the phenomenology of gnlsp models is very different from that of a model where the gluino is the lsp @xcite which we do not discuss in this paper .",

    "the nlo calculation retains the dominance of the @xmath32 at the level of 96% , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "we note that the model in table([gnlsp1 ] ) has a very small branching fraction @xmath27 ( calculated with susy - hit@xcite and a very similar suppression is seen with isajet @xcite ( @xmath60.1% ) ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the @xmath34 model ( see eq.([co ] ) ) , which has a @xmath35 of 65 % with susy - hit and 89% with isajet .",
    "the gluino decay branching ratios are discussed in further detail later .    in the left panel of fig.([mass ] ) we give a comparison of the average mass of the squarks vs the gluino mass in gnlsp and compare it to that for the msugra model .",
    "a similar analysis for the lightest squark mass is given on the right panel .",
    "in both cases one finds that aside from a very small region , the spectra from these two models do not overlap .",
    "quite remarkably for the assumed naturalness conditions as described in sec.([parameter ] ) the gluino mass in the gnlsp models has an upper limit of about a tev , while in msugra this limit extends far beyond . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limit on the squark masses is quite large extending to several tev in both cases .",
    "it is the relative lightness of the gluino mass in the gnlsp case that enhances the production of the gluinos relative to all other susy production processes such as @xmath36 and @xmath37 at the lhc .",
    "this further explains the result of fig.([gluinofactory1 ] ) and of table([gnlsp1 ] ) which show that the @xmath31 production cross section dominates over all others .",
    "thus in effect , in the gnlsp case , the lhc will become a gluino factory . nonetheless , the production cross section for the squarks is still significant and their production could be detectable with efficient cuts .",
    "for example , the stop is usually the lightest squark in gnlsp models , so its production could be significant , and it can decay via @xmath38 . since the @xmath39 has decays into @xmath40 , the stop will have some leptonic signatures while the gluino is a pure jet signal .",
    "an analysis of these leptonic signals requires a further dedicated analysis which is left for a future analysis .",
    "we also note that superficially the overlap of the few gnlsp points with the msugra point might be construed as the existence of a degeneracy for these parameter points .",
    "however , we need to keep in mind that what is plotted is an average squark mass .",
    "further , as already discussed there is a significant splitting between the squark masses and the slepton masses for the msugra model for the first two generations while there is very little splitting in this case for the gnlsp model .",
    "thus at the very least the slepton - squark splittings lift any perceived degeneracy indicated in fig.([mass ] ) .",
    "we should also point out that although the production cross section of squarks and gluinos can be comparable for gnlsp models and for msugra models , their lhc signatures tend to be significantly different due to the mass spectra of sparticles being rather different and specifically this is so since the gluino is the nlsp in the class of models we consider .",
    "* early lhc discovery prospects at low luminosity : * each gnlsp model is subject to the experimental constraints as discussed in section([exp ] ) .",
    "we investigate the lhc signatures of 1070 such gnlsp models with pythia coupled to pgs4 @xcite .",
    "branching fractions are computed with susy - hit and fed directly into the pythia decay table via the susy les houches accord ( slha ) @xcite interface . for the gnlsp models ,",
    "this is quite important as one must take into account the radiative decay @xmath35 which can be substantial for this class of models .",
    "the lhc detector simulation proceeds with pgs4 with the level 1 ( l1 ) triggers designed to mimic the compact muon solenoid detector ( cms ) specifications @xcite with the lhc detector card .",
    "specifically the l1 trigger level cuts that are imposed are as follows@xcite : ( 1 ) inclusive isolated lepton ( @xmath41/@xmath42 ) ( 30 gev ) ; ( 2 ) lepton plus jet ( 20 gev , 100 gev ) ; ( 3 ) isolated di - leptons ( 15 gev ) ; ( 4 ) di - leptons plus jet ( 10 gev , 100 gev ) ; ( 5 ) isolated di - leptons ( 10 gev ) ; ( 6 ) isolated lepton plus isolated @xmath43 ( 15 gev , 45 gev ) ; ( 7 ) isolated di - tau ( 60 gev ) ; ( 8) inclusive isolated photon ( 80 gev ) ; ( 9 ) isolated di - photon ( 25 gev ) ; ( 10 ) inclusive @xmath44 ( 90 gev ) ; ( 11 ) inclusive single - jet ( 400 gev ) ; ( 12 ) jet plus @xmath44 ( 180 gev , 80 gev ) ; ( 13 ) acoplanar jet and @xmath44 with @xmath45 ( 100 gev , 80 gev ) ( jet , @xmath44 ) ; ( 14 ) acoplanar di - jets with ( @xmath46 ) ( 200 gev ) . muon isolation is controlled by employing the cleaning script in pgs4 .",
    "sm backgrounds have been generated with qcd multi - jet production due to light quark flavors , heavy flavor jets ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , drell - yan , single @xmath49 production in association with quarks and gluons ( @xmath50/@xmath51 + jets ) , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 pair production .",
    "the standard criteria for the discovery limit are imposed , namely , that the susy signal is taken as discoverable if the number of susy events exceeds @xmath55 or 10 whichever is larger , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "we implement several classes of post trigger level cuts to analyze the sm background and our event samples .",
    "* post trigger level cuts : * as already noted the dominant sparticle production process at the lhc will be @xmath57 , and the dominant decays of the gluino are @xmath58 and depending on the particular part of the parameter space the decay @xmath59@xcite can also be large , and in fact can dominate over the 3 body decay , depending on a confluence of the following : ( a ) the lightness of the gluino , ( b ) the largeness of the squark masses , and ( c ) the neutralino mixing matrix . while a heavy gluino can decay into quarks and squarks and into weak gauge bosons @xmath60@xcite ,",
    "these decays are either kinematically forbidden , such as into quarks and squarks , or are highly suppressed for the gnlsp models we are discussing here .",
    "the above implies that gnlsp models will lead to a preponderance of jet signatures . in our analysis",
    "we impose three different sets of post trigger level cuts to optimize the signal and reduce the background from the standard model processes .",
    "we classify these as : ( i ) class 1 ( c1 ) , ( ii ) class 2 ( c2 ) , and ( iii ) class 3 ( c3 ) post trigger level cuts .",
    "we discuss these in some detail below and discuss the signals that are best detected with these three classes of cuts . before proceeding further",
    ", we note that the missing transverse momentum is an important cut both as a trigger level as well as a post trigger level cut allowing one to increase the signal relative to the background .",
    "thus susy models with a lsp which is massive tend to produce events at the hadron colliders with a larger missing energy . in order to suppress the standard model background ,",
    "usually a large missing transverse momentum cut is employed .",
    "we note further that since @xmath61 and @xmath62 are produced in the processes @xmath63 as well as with a certain fraction in @xmath57 with subsequent decays of @xmath10 ( this latter case being the most relevant one discussed here ) , one has a significant number of b jets produced in these events .",
    "thus b -tagging is a useful instrument in their identification .",

    "events with @xmath70 gev are selected .",
    "4 since the gnlsp models have a gluino which lies close to the lsp consistent with the relic density constraints , a large portion of events generated by the susy processes have a less energetic jet signal and a relatively smaller missing energy than may be observed , for example , in the case of stau coannihilation ( see @xcite for analysis of such a signature ) . taking the above into account we modified",

    "we also show the distributions for two gnlsp model points with masses of 400 and 500 gev respectively . a similar analysis is presented but as a function of the total jet @xmath65 ( labeled @xmath76 ) in the right panel of fig.([distributions ] ) , where again we also exhibit the distributions for two gnlsp model points .",
    "the analysis provides a good starting point for charting out the post trigger level cuts needed to reduce the background and enhance the signal .",
    "thus the analysis suggests that one may cut out the events that have a large @xmath75 as this cut will suppress the qcd background due to light quark flavors , @xmath47 and @xmath77 .",
    "a veto on isolated electrons or muons was applied to reject the background events containing @xmath51 or @xmath50 leptonic decays . a simple counting of events after applying c2 cuts reveals that the gnlsp models are nearly lepton free , as is the case for the @xmath78 and di - jets background . however , the standard model backgrounds due to drell - yan process and ( @xmath50/@xmath51 + jets ) have ( @xmath79 ) of the total events that contain electrons or muons , while for @xmath48 background it is about @xmath80 .",

    "another important signature is @xmath89 , which is the average magnitude of the missing transverse momentum , where the average extends over all events passing the cuts .",
    "we discuss now several signatures for the gnlsp models as given in fig.([c3cuts ] ) .",
    "the analysis of fig.([c3cuts ] ) is given at @xmath90 under post trigger level cuts c3 with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath0 .",

    "the right panel illustrates the ratio @xmath92 vs the gluino mass where @xmath93 is the total number of susy events and @xmath94 is the standard model background , again with the imposition of post trigger level cuts c3 .",
    "here one finds that the ratio @xmath92 lies above 5@xmath95 discovery limits for gluino masses up to 800 gev making this ratio an important channel for the discovery of the gnlsp models .",
    "the left panel of fig.([c3cutschannelandcompare ] ) demonstrates that the events containing a single tagged b - jet leads to a discoverable signal over a wide range of gluino masses .",
    "specifically this panel gives the ratio @xmath96 vs the gluino mass where @xmath97 is the number of susy events with 1 tagged b - jet and @xmath98 is the number of standard model events with 1 tagged b - jet under the imposition of class c3 cuts .",
    "this channel provides a @xmath99 discovery for gluino masses up to about 600 gev .",
    "we briefly comment on the ability to tag b - jets in this case .",
    "naively one would expect that for cases in which the dominant decays are @xmath100 , with sizeable branchings in b quarks , that the b - jet events would be a gold plated signal .",
    "however , here the b s come out rather soft since the mass splitting of the @xmath101 is rather small , typically around 50 gev ( the phenomenon responsible for the satisfaction of the relic density is precisely this mass split ) . while the ability to tag the b s is possible , it is indeed more difficult than the canonical situation seen on the hyperbolic branch of rewsb @xcite ( for recent work on b - tagging analyses see @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , as discussed above the signal for singly tagged b - jets is strong enough that it can be a useful one .",
    "the right panel of fig.([c3cutschannelandcompare ] ) we compare the 4-jet discovery limits under c1 and c3 cuts .",
    "here it is found that the sm background drops by an appreciable amount as one goes from c1 cuts to c3 cuts , allowing one to extend the discovery limit in 4-jet channel by over 100 gev with c3 cuts relative to imposing the c1 cuts in this channel . amongst the classes of n - jet events",
    ", we find this channel to be the most enhanced when passing from c1 to c3 .",
    "combining all the channels analyzed in fig.([c3cuts],[c3cutschannelandcompare ] ) one finds that gluino masses up to 800 gev are discoverable by this technique for a gnlsp model with just 10 fb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity .",
    "thus the validity of the gnlsp models can be tested with first data from the lhc .",
    "many of the gnlsp model points have an lsp neutralino which is bino like . however , there is also a significant set of models that have an lsp with large higgsino components ( many of which are at high @xmath102 but this is not exclusively so ) .",
    "the large @xmath103 parameter points are easily spotted by examining the @xmath102 vs @xmath104 plot in fig.([a - tanbeta ] ) .",
    "the gnlsp models have important implications for the direct detection of neutralino dark matter .",
    "an analysis of the spin independent and spin dependent cross sections in dark matter experiments is given in fig.([dark2 ] ) implemented with micromegas .",
    "included are published limits from the zeplin - iii experiment@xcite , the first five - tower cdms data@xcite and the xenon 10 results @xcite . projected limits ( indicated by * ) from cdms and lux",
    "are also shown @xcite .",
    "the @xmath105 vs @xmath106 analysis shows some interesting results .",
    "first one finds that there are a class of gnlsp models which are beginning to be constrained by the direct detection dark matter experiments .",
    "these models would also produce large @xmath107 production cross sections and will be easily visible at the lhc",
    ". however , interestingly there is another class of low mass neutralino ( and low mass gluino ) models which have rather small spin independent cross sections which are outside the reach of the direct detection experiments in the foreseeable future .",
    "nonetheless these models would still lead to rather large @xmath107 production cross sections and hence will be visible at the lhc . thus the lhc can detect many of the gnlsp models which are most likely inaccessible to the direct detection dark matter experiments . on the flip side , for the large set of low mass gnlsp models",
    "one still has the possibility of a very light neutralino ( gluino ) with a sizeable higgsino component and consequently a large spin independent cross section .",
    "thus if a light gluino is indeed indicated early on at the lhc , it may also provide a hint of the size of the dark matter signal in direct detection of dark matter .",
    "we note in passing that a plot of @xmath105 vs @xmath108 looks very similar to the left panel of fig.([dark2 ] ) as the gluino and neutralino mass are related at the low scale via @xmath109 .",
    "we note that in the gnlsp class of models , the direct annihilations of @xmath110 into electron positron pairs is helicity suppressed . for example , we obtain @xmath111 ( at @xmath112 ) for the model of table([gnlsp1 ] ) while the self annihilation into @xmath113 are equally small .",
    "annihilations into @xmath114 are found to be the largest ( this particular model has @xmath115 . thus a significant boost will be needed to explain the recent cosmic ray excess@xcite .",
    "it is useful to give benchmarks for the three gnlsp models a , b , and c discussed in sec.([gaugino ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , we go beyond the perturbative calculation , and include the sommerfeld enhancement of the cross section in these benchmarks . in table([benchain ] ) we give benchmarks for model gnlsp@xmath116 .",
    "the benchmarks are chosen to exhibit a significant diversity in the input values .",
    "some of the low lying spectrum as well as the spin independent cross section @xmath117 and the spin dependent cross section @xmath118 corresponding to table([benchain ] ) are exhibited in table([benchaout ] ) .",
    "the analysis of table([benchaout ] ) shows a variation over two orders of magnitude for @xmath117 .",
    "as discussed already the variation arises due to changes in the higgsino vs the bino component of the lsp .",
    "similar benchmarks for model gnlsp@xmath119 are given in table([benchbin ] ) and the corresponding light sparticle spectrum and the corresponding spin independent cross section @xmath117 and the spin dependent cross section @xmath118 are exhibited in table([benchbout ] ) .",
    "finally , a similar analysis for the model gnlsp@xmath30 is given in table([benchgin ] ) and table([benchgout ] ) .",
    "in the above we have given an analysis of a class of models with nonuniversalities which lead to a gluino as the nlsp .",
    "several important observations emerge from this analysis which have bearing on the observation of sparticles at the lhc .",
    "perhaps the most important of these is that if the gluino is the nlsp , then the @xmath57 cross section at the lhc dominates over all others in the gnlsp models .",
    "the dominance of the gluino production and the fact that the @xmath31 production cross sections are large implies that the observation of supersymmetry via the gluino production can occur with the first data from the lhc .",
    "it is found that the dominant signal of the gluino nlsp model are multi - jets , tagged b - jets and missing energy and it is possible to devise post trigger level cuts which discriminate these models above the standard model backgrounds .",
    "such cuts which reduce the background and enhance the signal to the background ratio were devised and implemented in this paper .",
    "we note also that the inverse of the lhc process , namely @xmath120 , is largely responsible for the satisfaction of the relic density when the neutralino and the gluino coannihilate .",
    "further , the analysis of gnlsp models reveals that there exists a significant region of the parameter space in these models where the neutralino has a large higgsino content , and the neutralino - proton spin independent scattering cross section is sizeable and can be probed with the current experimental sensitivity , and sensitivities that would be achievable in future experiments . however , there are also other regions of the parameter space where the neutralino is mostly bino like and in this case the spin independent cross sections can fall well below the current experimental sensitivity , and well below the sensitivity that would be achievable in the near future experiments .",
    "interestingly , the bino cases , though difficult to discover in dark matter experiments , can be accessible at the lhc since the gluino mass in these models lies within the reach of the lhc even at low luminosities .",
    "another aspect of the gnlsp models was also discussed which relates to the compressed nature of the sfermion mass spectrum relative to the case of universal gaugino masses . here",
    "the sleptons in the first two generations could be almost degenerate in mass and often even heavier than their squark counterparts .",
    "several benchmarks for the gnlsp models were also given to facilitate further work .",
    "it was also pointed out that a test of the gnlsp models can be done with just 10 fb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity and thus it is one of the models that can be checked with the early data at the lhc .",
    "finally , we emphasize once again that if the gluino is an nlsp then the production of gluinos will dominate all other sparticle production making the lhc effectively a gluino factory .",

    "the above situation leads to a near equality of the squark and of the slepton masses discussed in the text of the paper .",
    "the @xmath41 parameter also has a strong dependence on nonuniversalities .",

    "we provide here sample model points for the gnlsp class of models .",
    "each model point obeys experimental constraints as discussed in the text .",
    "we use here suspect 2.41 coupled to micromegas ( mo ) 2.2.cpc along with an independant code which agrees with mo at the pertuabtive level but accounts for the non - perturbative effects discussed in the text .",
    "similar model points may be obtained with other spectrum calculators coupled to mo [ see , for example , table([gnlspcompare ] ) where one such comparison is given , which , however , is only at the perturbative level ] .",

    "<S> the possibility that the gluino is the next to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is discussed and it is shown that this situation arises in nonuniversal sugra models within a significant part of the parameter space compatible with all known experimental bounds . </S>",
    "<S> it is then shown that the gluino nlsp ( gnlsp ) models lead to a compressed sfermion spectrum with the sleptons often heavier than the squarks at least for the first two generations . </S>",
    "<S> the relic density here is governed by gluino coannihilation which is responsible for a relatively small mass splitting between the gluino and the neutralino masses . </S>",
    "<S> thus the gnlsp class of models is very predictive first because the susy production cross sections at the lhc are dominated by gluino production and second because the gluino production itself proceeds dominantly through a single channel which allows for a direct determination of the gluino mass and an indirect determination of the neutralino mass due to a linear relation between these two masses which is highly constrained by coannihilation . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of these models shows that the jet production and tagged b - jets from the gluino production can be discriminated from the standard model background with appropriate cuts . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the gnlsp models can be tested with just 10 fb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity and may therefore be checked with low luminosity runs in the first data at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> thus if a gnlsp model is realized , the lhc will turn into a gluino factory through a profuse production of gluinos with typically only a small fraction @xmath1 of total susy events arising from other production modes over the allowed gnlsp model parameter space .    </S>",
