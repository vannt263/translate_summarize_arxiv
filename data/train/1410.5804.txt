    "this paper concerns the construction of fundamental domains for properly discontinuous group actions , by isometries , on a lorentzian space , specifically the @xmath0-dimensional anti - de sitter space @xmath2 . in the setting of group actions on riemannian spaces such as the euclidean or the real hyperbolic space ,",
    "there are standard procedures for constructing fundamental domains , e.g.  dirichlet polyhedra .",
    "however , such constructions make crucial use of the riemannian metric , and typically can not be made to work in the lorentzian setting ( nor in other nonmetric settings ) .",
    "hence the construction of fundamental domains in lorentzian geometry is often more of an ad hoc endeavor .    in the setting of @xmath0-dimensional flat lorentzian geometry , or minkowski geometry ,",
    "drumm @xcite introduced piecewise linear surfaces called _ crooked planes _ and used them to build polyhedral fundamental domains for _ margulis spacetimes_. these are the quotients of the minkowski @xmath0-space @xmath3 ( namely @xmath4 endowed with a translation - invariant metric of signature @xmath5 ) by free groups acting properly discontinuously by affine isometries .",
    "the first such spacetimes were discovered by margulis @xcite in 1983 , as counterexamples to a possible extension @xcite of the auslander conjecture @xcite . since then , margulis spacetimes and their fundamental domains have been the object of a rich literature , most prominently by charette , drumm , goldman , labourie , and margulis : see @xcite .",
    "recently , we showed in @xcite that every margulis spacetime @xmath6 comes ( in an essentially unique way ) from a so - called _ infinitesimal strip deformation _ of a noncompact hyperbolic surface , and that consequently @xmath6 admits a fundamental domain bounded by pairwise disjoint crooked planes .",
    "this last result had been conjectured by drumm and goldman @xcite , and was known as the _ crooked plane conjecture_.    the @xmath0-dimensional _ anti - de sitter space _",
    "@xmath2 is a model space for lorentzian geometry of constant negative curvature .",
    "there is a close connection between the theory of complete @xmath1 spacetimes , specifically quotients of @xmath2 , and the theory of margulis spacetimes . in particular",
    ", we showed in @xcite that any margulis spacetime is , in a certain sense , a rescaled limit of collapsing @xmath1 spacetimes .",
    "it follows from more recent work  @xcite ( see appendix  [ app : convergence ] ) that such families of collapsing @xmath1 spacetimes may be constructed explicitly by deforming a fundamental domain in minkowski space , bounded by drumm s crooked planes , into fundamental domains in @xmath2 . specifically , the collapsing spacetimes admit collapsing fundamental domains in @xmath2 bounded by piecewise geodesic surfaces , which we call _ ads crooked planes _ , and the rescaled limit of these fundamental domains is the fundamental domain for the limiting margulis spacetime .",
    "the construction actually implies that fundamental domains bounded by ads crooked planes exist for a large open set in the moduli space of properly discontinuous actions of a free group on @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to prove the following :    [ thm : no - crooked - fd ] there exist properly discontinuous actions of finitely generated free groups on @xmath2 that do not admit any fundamental domain in @xmath2 bounded by pairwise disjoint @xmath1 crooked planes .",
    "thus , while the analogy between @xmath0-dimensional minkowski and anti - de sitter geometry is very strong , the analogue of the crooked plane conjecture in @xmath2 is false .",
    "the question of which proper actions on @xmath2 admit crooked fundamental domains ( question  [ q : fund - domain ] ) remains open .",
    "theorem  [ thm : no - crooked - fd ] is proved in section  [ sec : no - crooked - fd ] .",
    "prior to this , we establish several useful results about @xmath1 crooked planes :    * theorems [ thm : ads - disj - left ] and  [ thm : ads - disj - right ] give complete disjointness criteria for @xmath1 crooked planes ( see also theorems [ thm : ads - disj - sq - left ] and  [ thm : ads - disj - sq - right ] in appendix  [ app : sq ] ) . they should be compared with the disjointness criterion of drumm ",
    "goldman @xcite for crooked planes in  @xmath3 .",
    "* theorem  [ thm : charact - crooked - domains ] gives a necessary and sufficient condition , in terms of @xmath7-dimensional hyperbolic geometry , for the existence of a fundamental domain bounded by pairwise disjoint @xmath1 crooked planes .",
    "* corollary  [ cor : ads - drumm - shortening ] is the analogue , in @xmath2 , of drumm s result in  @xmath3 @xcite that gluing together a polyhedron @xmath8 bounded by disjoint crooked planes yields a proper action ( which one could call a _ lorentzian schottky group _ ) for which @xmath8 is a fundamental domain .",
    "we first recall a few basic facts on @xmath0-dimensional anti - de sitter geometry , as well as the definition of @xmath1 crooked planes introduced in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional anti - de sitter space @xmath9 is a model space for lorentzian @xmath0-manifolds of constant negative curvature .",
    "it can be realized as the ( open ) set of negative points in @xmath10 with respect to a quadratic form of signature @xmath11 ; its isometry group is @xmath12 .",
    "the intersection of @xmath2 with an affine chart of @xmath10 is the region bounded by a one - sheeted hyperboloid .",
    "let @xmath13 be the group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane @xmath14 , with identity component @xmath15 consisting of orientation - preserving isometries .",
    "then @xmath2 can be realized as the group @xmath16 equipped with the biinvariant lorentzian structure induced by half the killing form of @xmath17 ; the group of orientation - preserving isometries of @xmath2 then identifies with @xmath18 acting on  @xmath16 by right and left multiplication : @xmath19 .",
    "the boundary @xmath20 of @xmath2 in @xmath10 identifies with the projectivization of the set of @xmath21-matrices of rank  @xmath22 , which itself identifies with @xmath23 by taking the projectivized kernel and the projectivized image .",
    "the action of @xmath24 on @xmath2 induces the natural action of @xmath24 on @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the boundary at infinity of  @xmath14 .      by @xcite ,",
    "any torsion - free discrete subgroup of @xmath24 acting properly  discontinuously on @xmath2 is necessarily , up to switching the two factors of @xmath27 , of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a discrete group and @xmath30 are two representations with @xmath31 injective and discrete .",
    "suppose that @xmath29 is finitely generated .",
    "by @xcite , a necessary and sufficient condition for the action of @xmath32 on @xmath2 to be properly discontinuous is that ( up to switching the two factors ) @xmath31 be injective and discrete and @xmath33 `` uniformly shorter '' than  @xmath31 , in the sense that there exists a @xmath34-equivariant lipschitz map @xmath35 with lipschitz constant @xmath36 .",
