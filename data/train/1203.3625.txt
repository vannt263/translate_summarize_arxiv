    ", we will analyse all available experimental data for the charge - exchange ( cx ) reaction @xmath14 and re - address the violation of the isospin invariance in the hadronic part of the @xmath11 interaction . in our program , we make use of the electromagnetic ( em ) corrections of refs .",

    "due to numerous problems which we have encountered in the analysis of these data @xcite , we have decided not to include them in our database . * a large amount of cx data appeared after the completion of the uzh06 psa . in some cases ,",

    ". such a strategy could be less problematic , if they had implemented robust statistics in their data analysis ; instead , their results are obtained with a ` standard ' @xmath3 function ( i.e. , the arndt - roper formula ) , and are thus expected to be sensitive to the presence of outliers in the database ( in particular , to the presence of _ one - sided _",
    "outliers ) . * the said results at low energies",
    "are literally swamped by the measurements at higher energies . in case that the floating of the data sets is allowed ( as is when using the arndt - roper formula in the optimisation ) ,",
    "it is unavoidable that the low - energy behaviour of the @xmath11 amplitudes will be influenced from higher energies . as a result",
    ", the low - energy experiments will be scaled systematically in such a way as to match the trends of the amplitudes suitable for the higher - energy data .",
    "* we have not found a published plot from the said group , showing the energy dependence of their scale factors below @xmath183 mev . *",
    "the distribution of the normalised residuals and the function which is used in the optimisation are intimately connected . in case that a @xmath3 minimisation function is used , the distribution of the normalised residuals must , in a self - consistent analysis , be a gaussian centred at @xmath158 .",
    "any effects observed in the distribution of the normalised residuals ( e.g. , significant offset , asymmetry of the distribution ) are indicative of problems during the fitting procedure .",

    "the data sets which must be scaled ` upwards ' should ( more or less ) be balanced by those which must be scaled ` downwards ' .",
    "additionally , the energy dependence of the scale factors over the energy range of the analysis should not be significant .",

    "a second issue which must be investigated in a fit involving the minimisation of any @xmath3 function is whether the distribution of the normalised residuals @xmath199 , defined as @xmath200 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : chijsq ] ) ) , evaluated on the basis of the optimal parameter values , is gaussian  , appearing in the second term on the rhs of eq .",

    "one fits a gaussian function to the distribution of the normalised residuals , i.e. , @xmath201 and investigates the quality of the fit ( expressed through the corresponding @xmath3 value and the ndf in the fit ) , as well as the asymmetry of the fitted distribution ( e.g. , expressed through the deviation of the extracted value of @xmath202 from @xmath158 ) .",
    "the distribution of the normalised residuals is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals ] , along with the optimal gaussian function .",
    "the @xmath3 value of this fit was @xmath203 for @xmath204 dof in the fit , whereas @xmath205 , i.e. , compatible with @xmath158 .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we also give the optimal value and the uncertainty of the parameter @xmath206 : @xmath207 ; the expectation value for @xmath206 is @xmath208 .",

    "the values of the scale factor for the three data sets ( in the same order ) are @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 ; the reported normalisation uncertainty of the data is @xmath217 .",
    "it is evident that our hadronic phase shifts reproduce the meier04 measurements very well ; even the smallest p - value does not fall below @xmath218 .",
    "this is a good test of the consistency of our approach in describing the energy and angular dependence of the @xmath0 elastic - scattering data .",
    "we will now comment on the reproduction of the old measurements of bertin  ( bertin76 ) @xcite , which are ` traditionally ' considered outliers in almost all modern psas .",
    "reported in ref .",
    "@xcite were @xmath1 dcs measurements obtained in a broad angular interval , at seven beam energies ( @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 mev ) .",
    "the experimental group did not report any normalisation uncertainties for their measurements ; it can not be excluded that , at those times , the absolute normalisation was not seriously investigated in the @xmath11 experiments .",
    "we assigned rough normalisation uncertainties to the bertin76 data , on the basis of the values obtained from the modern low - energy experiments which properly reported this quantity , and analysed these measurements as if they comprised the entire db@xmath47 at low energies .",
    "the analysis in terms of our general @xmath70-matrix parameterisations of section [ sec : k - matrix_pi+p ] revealed that the data set at @xmath223 mev had to be eliminated due to its ( very bad ) shape .",
    "we were able to fit the remaining data successfully , and obtained the final @xmath3 value of @xmath226 for @xmath227 dof in the fit .",
    "we subsequently investigated how well the phase - shift solution of the present study reproduces the bertin76 data ; it failed .",
    "the basic problem with the bertin76 measurements lies with their absolute normalisation , not with their shape ( though the shapes of the data sets at @xmath221 and at @xmath225 mev do not pass our @xmath41 criterion ) .",
    "for instance , for the data set at @xmath219 mev , @xmath228 when the overall uncertainty @xmath229 ( defined at the end of section [ sec : mf ] ) is equal to @xmath230 ; this is the most striking discrepancy in the data .",
    "the extracted @xmath37 factors decrease almost linearly with @xmath231 , reaching @xmath232 at @xmath225 mev . in view of these large energy - dependent effects in their absolute normalisation",
    ", we will continue excluding the bertin76 data in our psas .",
    "in the present work , comprising the first of three papers dealing with issues of the pion - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) interaction below pion laboratory kinetic energy of @xmath183 mev , we report the results of a new phase - shift analysis ( psa ) of the @xmath0 elastic - scattering data , using the electromagnetic ( em ) corrections of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are two main differences to the approach we set forth in our previous psa @xcite , both pertaining to the method for the exclusion of outliers , single data points and entire data sets , in the optimisation phase .",

    "@xcite , we instead performed several tests ( on shape , normalisation , etc . ) for each data set ; the use of only one test led to the exclusion of fewer data compared to ref .",
    "the second difference concerns the imposition of a more stringent acceptance criterion of the null hypothesis in the statistical tests .",
    "herein , we raised the minimal p - value ( @xmath41 ) for the acceptance of the null hypothesis from the equivalent of a @xmath53 to a @xmath44 effect in the normal distribution ; the latter value is closer to the ` common ' choice ( of most statisticians ) as the outset of statistical significance .",

    "we found that it is possible to obtain self - consistent databases by removing the measurements of two @xmath1 and one @xmath2 data sets , as well as a few single data points ; the removal of these outliers resulted in enormous reductions in the minimal @xmath3 values for the separate fits to the two elastic - scattering databases using the @xmath70-matrix parameterisations .",
    "we give all the details concerning the accepted data sets in tables [ tab : dbpi+p ] and [ tab : dbpi - p ] ; these details may be useful in other analyses .",
