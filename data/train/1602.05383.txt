    "same as in .,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    we then proceed to discuss the results in ( frustration f@xmath1 ) and ( frustration f@xmath2 ) , which reveal some salient features .",
    "firstly , we verified that , with @xmath83 , independent of @xmath4 .",
    "the momentum products show that , _ in all cases _ , the system starts out with a magnetization plateau : and , which corresponds to the lieb - mattis@xcite phase of the analogous spin-1/2 system , before undergoing a phase transition at .",
    "this transition is of second order , as shown in and , and of first order , as shown in and .    in the first case ( @xmath79 )",
    ", the system evolves continually ( with the mf energy curve - and - smooth at the point @xmath81 ) to a stable phase where the momenta at a and b sites become uncorrelated , i.e. , , while the momenta at b sites tend to directly oppose each other with increasing @xmath4 , forming a singlet - like configuration : , for .    in the second case ( @xmath84 ) , the transition takes place quite abruptly , having undoubtedly first - order characteristics , and the system immediately accommodates into the stable singlet - like phase that we have just referred to .",
    "the mf energy curves of these first - order transitions at @xmath81 are shown in and , where we notice that the cusp in the latter is less pronounced .",
    "we notice further , that the products between the momenta at a and b sites display quite sizable fluctuations around , as seen in and ( @xmath85 ) , and in lesser degree in for frustration @xmath39 and @xmath86 . the corresponding wide points occur pairwise and fairly symmetrically with respect to classical curves ( see below ) that represent the decoupling of the momenta at a and b sites , leaving the mf energy practically unaltered .",
    "in fact , with increasing @xmath4 , the system becomes more prone to wandering through near - degenerate states , which give rise to these off points .",
    "the phase , for @xmath87 , with a sites uncoupled and b sites with opposing momenta in a singlet - like configuration is much like the dimer - monomer phase of the work by takano , kubo , and sakamoto @xcite .",
    "we perceive , however , that important features in between those @xmath4 extremes of the phase diagram do not appear by way of this naive _ single - site _ mf theory .",

    "therefore , through this mf approach , we are led to envision the momenta on the unit cell of the ab@xmath2 chain as classical vectors of constant magnitude , such as represented in .",
    "we can thus provide a simple interpretation based on this configuration of classical vectors on the _ xy _ plane ( akin to the _",
    "xy_-model ) .",
    "we then build our energy function for the configuration in ( @xmath89 ) on a symmetric unit of the ab@xmath2 chain centered on the a site .",
    "the classical constraints may be set as @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( we take @xmath3 constant , which is about true for small @xmath92 , as verified in the simulations , and whose value must be read off from the plots ) .",
    "we start off with the energy function for the frustration f@xmath1 , taking into account the cases @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "finally , for @xmath207 the three chains are antiferromagnetically ordered with the b momenta lying in the @xmath208 direction and the a momenta ordered in the @xmath209 direction , which is the classical analog of the decoupled phase observed for @xmath210 for the quantum rotors and for @xmath211 for the spin system @xcite .",

    "in dealing with quantum rotors placed at the sites of an ab@xmath2 chain we resorted to a cluster variational mf theory implemented via two distinct approaches , which yielded different results .",
    "first , we learned that the size of the hilbert space could be considerably reduced without affecting results , with the proviso that the rotor states should be kept possibly nearest ( @xmath11)-momentum states .",
    "that was attained by increasing the importance of the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian ( by setting relatively high values of the coupling @xmath9 ) , whenever needed .",
    "this was a most important fact for the computations in multiple - cell clusters in the second approach .",
    "in the first approach the natural single - site mf theory was developed .",
    "a two - phase pattern was produced with the phase transition between them being of second order for @xmath86 and of first order for @xmath223 . for @xmath224 , the lieb - mattis - like phase typical in the spin-1/2 system arose , and for @xmath87 , we observed the decoupling of the system where the momenta on the a sites tend to become uncorrelated with the momenta on the b sites , which in turn formed singlet - like pairs , while the decoupling of the a sites was a salient feature laid bare by this approach , much like the dimer - monomer phase in ref . 12 .",
    "a classical interpretation was laid down that conformed to our qr numerical findings , inclusively showing how the fixed coupling momentum - position turns the second - order transition into a first - order one , when @xmath41 .",
    "however , we were not able to provide a reasonable quantum picture that could relate to the known behavior of the corresponding quantum ab@xmath2 chain",
    ". furthermore , treated this way the system was not able to essentially tell apart frustration f@xmath1 from frustration f@xmath2 and this alone constituted a major setback .",
    "so , all this was a reminder that the main goal of our work still remained to be achieved .    in our last step , we then improved the former approach by producing a cluster ( double - cell ) variational mf theory in which the trial hamiltonian acts on the space composed of the tensor product of the respective local subspaces of the six sites at two neighboring unit cells .",
    "the gist of this theory stands on the important fact that it allows the construction of the two - point correlations @xmath225 between any pairs of operators acting on sites @xmath226 of the cluster .",
    "this afforded us the observation of quantum features inherent in the system , as well as to distinguish between both frustrations f@xmath1 and f@xmath2 .",
    "for the construction of this more complex `` system '' , we relied on the availability of processing capacity to carry out the numerical implementation .    for frustration f@xmath1 , besides the qr numerical simulation , we carried out ed on the spin-1/2 diamond chain using a system with 28 sites and calculated the correlation functions between spin at a central cluster , as well as other relevant physical quantities . upon confronting with the qr results",
    ", we verified that the qr phase diagrams obtained through numerical implementation of the double - cell mf variational approach exhibited a sequence of phases analogous to those of the spin chains , with phase transitions of the same nature .",
    "we therefore produced the ferri - td - dm phase sequence , with first order transitions , which is in essence the phase diagram of ref .",
    "the transition point ferri - td at @xmath163 is somewhat displaced , but the transition point at @xmath130 was exactly calculated by our approach .    for frustration f@xmath2",

    "notwithstanding , the criticality of the a spins correlations manifests itself here as an af magnetic ordering due to finite - size effects . for the same reason ,",
    "we can not probe the short - rangedness of the correlation functions between b momenta . we also produced ed as well as dmrg results that helped us to visualize the spiral phase in the spin system , and derived an insightful classical interpretation .",

    "<S> we present the ground state phase diagram of @xmath0 quantum - rotor chains with competing interactions ( frustration ) calculated through cluster variational mean field approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two interaction patterns , named f@xmath1 and f@xmath2 models , between the quantum - rotor momentum and position operators , which follow exchange patterns of known one - dimensional spin-1/2 systems with a ferrimagnetic state in their phase diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the spin-1/2 f@xmath1 model is known as the diamond chain and is related to the azurite compound , while the spin-1/2 f@xmath2 model was recently shown to present a frustration - induced condensation of magnons . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a detailed comparison between the quantum - rotor phase diagrams , in single- and multi - site mean - field approaches , and known results for the spin-1/2 models , including exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group data for these systems , as well as phase diagrams of the associated classical models . </S>"
