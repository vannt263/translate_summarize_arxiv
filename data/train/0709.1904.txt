    "hydrogen cyanide , hcn , and its isomer hnc are among the most abundant organic molecules in space , from star - forming regions to circumstellar envelopes and comets .",
    "hcn and hnc also belong to the small class of molecules detected in high - redshift galaxies , along with co and hco@xmath5 ( gulin et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to thermal emission from various rotational transitions within different vibrational states at ( sub)millimeter and far - infrared wavelengths ( see , e.g. , cernicharo et al .",
    "1996 ) , a few masering lines have been detected toward several stars ( e.g. lucas & cernicharo 1989 ) .",
    "numerous isotopologues have also been identified , in particular the deuterated species dcn and dnc ( e.g leurini et al . 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "one interesting observation concerning rotational spectra of hcn is that of the hyperfine anomalies ( walmsley , churchwell & fitzpatrick 1982 and references therein ) . at high resolution",
    "it is possible to resolve the hyperfine components arising from the nitrogen ( @xmath6n ) nuclear spin for transitions arising from low - lying rotational levels .",
    "the hyperfine lines have been found in a number of cases ( e.g. izumiura , ukita & tsuji 1995 ; park , kim & minh 1999 ; ahrens et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) to be not in thermal equilibrium with each other .",
    "these anomalies have been shown to depend on the degree of thermal overlap , on the opacity and on the collisional rates ( e.g. guilloteau & baudry 1981 ; gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo 1993 ; turner 2001 ) .    already thirty years ago it was suggested that when the electron fraction exceeds @xmath710@xmath8 , electron - impact excitation of polar molecules may be significant in addition to collisions with the most abundant neutrals ( dickinson et al .",
    "such conditions can be found for example in diffuse interstellar clouds and photon - dominated regions where @xmath9(e)@xmath10(h ) can reach a few 10@xmath11 .",
    "recently lovell et al .",
    "( 2004 ) devoted their study to the effect of electrons in the rotational excitation of cometary hcn .",
    "they showed that electron collisions are the dominant mechanism of hcn excitation in the comets hale - bopp and hyakutake where the electron fraction , @xmath9(e)@xmath10(h@xmath12o ) , lies in the range @xmath7  10@xmath8@xmath01 .",
    "the authors stated that accounting for electron collisions may thus alleviate the need for large hcn - h@xmath12o cross sections in models that neglect effects due to electrons .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn in the case of water ( faure , gorfinkiel & tennyson 2004a and references therein ) .",
    "recently jimenez - serra et al . (",
    "2006 ) used rotational emissions of sio , hco@xmath5 , hcn and hnc to probe electron densities in c - type shocks .",
    "in particular they ascribed differences in the ambient and precursor components to electron density enhancements during the first stages of the c - type shock evolution .",
    "the dipolar ion hco@xmath5 was found to be a sensitive tracer of this effect .",
    "a theoretical determination of rotational cross sections and rate coefficients for e@xmath0hcn was carried out by saha et al .",
    "( 1981 ) for the rotationally inelastic transitions @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "cross sections were computed using the rotational close - coupling method and rate coefficients were obtained in the temperature range 5@xmath0100  k. an additional study includes that of jain & norcross ( 1985 ) , where the adiabatic - nuclei - rotation ( anr ) approximation was combined with model potentials .",
    "the cross sections were computed for the same set of transitions as in saha et al .",
    "in addition to electron scattering , the rotational excitation of hcn by he as substitute for h@xmath12 has been studied by green & thaddeus ( 1974 ) , green ( unpublished data)100 k ) were extended in 1993 to obtain rate constants among the lowest 30 rotational levels and for temperatures of 100@xmath01200 k. these unpublished results are available at http://data.giss.nasa.gov/mcrates/#hcn ] and monteiro & stutzki ( 1986 ) ( see also references therein ) .",
    "this latter work also provided hyperfine rates for @xmath15=0@xmath04 and @xmath16=10@xmath030  k.    in the present study , the molecular * r*-matrix method has been combined with the adiabatic - nuclei - rotation ( anr ) approximation .",
    "we provide e@xmath0hcn rotational rates for transitions among all levels up to @xmath15=8 and for temperatures in the range 5@xmath06000  k. hyperfine rates are obtained within the infinite order sudden ( ios ) scaling method for @xmath17 .",
    "comparisons to the previous theoretical studies and to differential data is also presented . in section 2 , * r*-matrix calculations are described and the procedure used to obtain rotational and hyperfine rates is briefly introduced . in section 3 , both cross sections and rate coefficients are presented and discussed .",
    "conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "two of us ( varambhia & tennyson 2007 ) have carried out * r*-matrix calculations on hcn and hnc at the close - coupling level in c@xmath18 symmetry . the calculations were performed using the uk molecular polyatomic * r*-matrix package ( morgan , tennyson & gillan 1998 ) at the ( fixed ) equilibrium geometries of hcn and hnc using an r - matrix radius 10  a@xmath19 .",
    "hcn and hnc ( hence dcn and dnc ) were represented by the 6 - 31 g gaussian type orbital ( gto ) basis set .",
    "the target wavefunctions were computed using the complete active space configuration interaction ( casci ) method .",
    "they were subsequently improved using a pseudo natural orbitals calculation .",
    "the five lowest c@xmath18 electronically excited states @xmath20a@xmath21 , @xmath22a@xmath21 , @xmath22a@xmath12 , @xmath22b@xmath21 , @xmath22b@xmath12 were employed and all possible single and double excitations to virtual orbitals were included . in order to incorporate the double excitation however , it was necessary to freeze eight electrons ( the 1s and 2s electrons of the c and n atoms ) .",
    "for both hcn and hnc the weighting coefficients for the density matrix averaging procedure were 5.75 , 1.5 , 1.5 , 1.5 , 1.5 for @xmath20a@xmath21 , @xmath22a@xmath21 , @xmath22a@xmath12 , @xmath22b@xmath21 , @xmath22b@xmath12 respectively .",
    "this target model yielded dipole moments @xmath02.87  d and @xmath02.91  d for hcn and hnc respectively , which can be compared to the experimental values @xmath02.985  d ( ebenstein & muenter 1984 ) and @xmath03.05  d ( blackman et al . 1976 ) .",
    "the scattering wavefunctions were represented by a close - coupling expansion including 24 target electronic states , done to keep the expected shape resonance as low as possible .",
    "calculations were performed on the scattering states @xmath23a@xmath21 , @xmath23b@xmath21 , @xmath23b@xmath12 , @xmath23a@xmath12 .",
    "the continuum gtos are those of faure et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and are expanded up to @xmath24 ( @xmath25=4 ) partial wave .",
    "one virtual orbital was allocated to each symmetry where target orbitals were available to do so .",
    "this scattering model also used the separable treatment of continuum and virtual orbitals in order to allow for increased polarizability and hence further reduce the position of any resonance yielded by the model .",
    "further discussion on the problem of convergence of the polarisation interaction in close - coupling methods can be found in varambhia & tennyson ( 2007 ) , gil et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and gorfinkiel and tennyson ( 2004 ) . the resulting fixed - nuclei ( body fixed ) * t*-matrices were used to obtain the pure rotation excitation cross - section in the collision energy range 0.01@xmath06.2  ev ( see section  3.2 ) .",
    "the positions of the shape resonances for these molecules are inside the scattering energy ranges .    in the fixed - geometry approximation ,",
    "the dcn and dnc electronic wavefunctions are identical to those of hcn and hnc , respectively .",
    "the distinction between the isotopologues therefore arises , in the present treatment , only from the different rotational excitation thresholds ( see below ) .",
    "we consider here an electron scattering from a polar linear neutral molecule in the fixed - nuclei ( fn ) approximation ( lane 1980 ) . in this approach ,",
    "the cross sections are expressed as a partial - wave expansion within the anr approximation which assumes that the initial and final target rotational states are degenerate . for low partial waves ( here @xmath264 ) ,",
    "the cross section is computed from the fn * t*-matrices obtained via the @xmath27matrix calculations . in the case of dipole",
    "forbidden transitions ( i.e. those with @xmath28 ) , cross sections are expected to converge rapidly and can be safely evaluated using fn * t*-matrices only ( see section  3.1 ) . in the case of dipole allowed transitions ( @xmath2 ) , however , the partial - wave expansion does not converge in the fn approximation , owing to the very long - range nature of the electron - dipole interaction . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "the standard procedure is to use the dipolar born approximation to obtain the cross section for the high partial - waves not included in the fn * t*-matrices ( crawford & dalgarno 1971 ) . in this case , the final cross section is calculated as the sum of two contributions and can be regarded as a short - range correction to the ( dipolar ) born approximation .",
    "the known unphysical behaviour of the fn cross - sections near rotational thresholds , inherent in the anr approximation , is corrected using a simple kinematic ratio ( chang & temkin 1970 ) which forces the excitation cross sections to zero at threshold . in the case of e@xmath0h@xmath12",
    ", this procedure has been shown to be accurate down to a collision energy @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the rotational threshold ( morrison 1988 ) . recently",
    ", experimental data for the scattering of cold electrons with water has also confirmed the validity of the adiabatic threshold - corrected approximation down to very low electron energies ( urk et al .",
    "2006 ; faure , gorfinkiel & tennyson 2004b ) . note that threshold effects could only be included rigorously in a full rotational close - coupling calculation , which is impractical at the collision energies investigated here . in this context",
    ", it is worth stressing that in the case of molecular ions , cross sections are large and finite at threshold with a significant but moderate contribution from closed - channels ( faure et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "finally , in order to make comparisons with available experimental data , differential cross sections were computed using the born - closure method for the scattering amplitude , as described in itikawa ( 2000 ) . in this approach , the high - partial waves contribution ( @xmath31 ) due to the quadrupole and induced - dipole interactions was also included .",
    "the hyperfine interaction arises due to the very weak coupling of nuclear spin to the molecular rotation , which to an excellent approximation does not affect the overall collision dynamics . in the laboratory , ahrens et al .",
    "( 2002 ) measured ground state rotational transitions of hcn using sub - doppler saturation spectroscopy in the thz region .",
    "this technique enables features such as hyperfine structure to be revealed , which within doppler limits , would remain hidden .",
    "nine consecutive rotational transitions with their associated hyperfine structure have been thus partly resolved .",
    "additional study includes that of turner ( 2001 ) . here",
    "the transitions @xmath32 and @xmath33 were observed toward dark clouds for the deuterated molecules n@xmath12d@xmath5 , dcn and dnc , from which molecular constants including the complex nuclear quadrupole hyperfine splitting were derived .",
    "more recently the nuclear quadrupole hyperfine structure of hnc and dnc was resolved in the laboratory for the first time using millimetre - wave absorption spectroscopy ( bechtel , steeves & field 2006 ) .",
    "new rest frequencies for the @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 rotational transitions of the ground vibrational state were determined .",
    "it was found that the hyperfine structure of hnc is dominated by the interaction of the valence shell electrons with the nuclear spin of the nitrogen atom .",
    "the hyperfine structure of dnc , however , was much more complicated due to the additional coupling of the deuterium nucleus ( @xmath36=1 ) .",
    "this coupling gave rise to a septet in the @xmath32 transition .",
    "as hyperfine structure is resolved in some of the astronomical spectra , it is crucial to know the rate coefficients among these energy levels . in the following ,",
    "only the spin of the @xmath6n atom is considered as the effects of the spins of h and d atoms on the collisional rates is assumed negligible , although of course they affect the energy levels .",
    "hyperfine states are labeled by @xmath15 and @xmath37 , where @xmath37 is the total angular momentum obtained by coupling @xmath15 to @xmath36 , the nuclear spin ( @xmath38 for @xmath6n ) .",
    "if the hyperfine levels are assumed to be degenerate , it is possible to simplify considerably the hyperfine scattering problem ( corey & mccourt 1983 ) . within the anr or ios approximation , which both ignore the rotational spacings ,",
    "the scattering equations are further simplified and the rates among rotational and hyperfine levels can be simply calculated in terms of ` fundamental ' rotational rates , @xmath39 : @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 are wigner-@xmath43 and wigner-@xmath44 symbols , respectively .    however , as the anr rotational cross sections are corrected for threshold effects ( see above ) , eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are only moderately accurate for the actual rates .",
    "we have therefore implemented the scaling method proposed by neufeld & green ( 1994 ) in which the hyperfine rates are obtained as a scaling of the rotational rates : @xmath45 using the actual rates @xmath46 for the ios fundamental rates .",
    "for quasi - elastic transitions , i.e. @xmath47 with @xmath48 , eq .  ( 2 ) is used directly , as recommended by neufeld & green ( 1994 ) . note that fundamental rates for _ downward _ transitions were employed as these were found to provide better results in the case of he@xmath0hcn for which accurate close - coupling hyperfine rates are available ( monteiro & stutzki 1986 ) .",
    "finally , it should be noted that within the ios approximation , the allowed transitions or selection rules are determined by the wigner-@xmath44 symbol , as expressed in eq .",
    "interestingly , the same selection rules have been obtained by chu ( 1976 ) and varshalovich & khersonskii ( 1977 ) from multipole expansion approaches .",
    "radiative ( dipolar ) selection rules are also determined by the above @xmath44 symbol with @xmath49 .",
    "the comparison with experimental differential cross sections is often the only reliable way for testing electron - molecule calculations . in the case of polar targets ,",
    "integral cross sections deduced from experiments are indeed strongly dependent on the extrapolation procedure used to estimate the small - angle scattering which can not be detected experimentally ( e.g. faure et al 2004b ) .",
    "we have computed the elastic ( rotationally summed ) differential cross sections for electron scattering from hcn at the electron energy of 5  ev in order to compare our calculations with the experimental results of srivastava et al .",
    "( 1978 ) . as shown in fig .  1",
    ", our calculations reproduce the experimental data only qualitatively .",
    "quantitatively , our results are larger by roughly a factor of 2 at angles @xmath50 .",
    "it can be noticed that the dipolar transition 0@xmath511 dominates over all other transitions at both forward and backward angles .",
    "sharp dips are also observed in the 0@xmath511 transition at about 20 , 70 and 120@xmath52 .",
    "we note that these dips , which reflect rainbow scattering ( e.g. korsch & ernesti 1992 ) , are not completely suppressed by the contribution of the other transitions in the total curve .",
    "more experimental study is clearly necessary to interpret the difference between theory and experiment , as already suggested sometime ago by jain & norcross ( 1985 ) .",
    "note that the born completion was found to be crucial in the case of the dipole interaction , as expected for very polar species .",
    "dipole allowed transitions were thus found to be largely dominated by the high - partial waves ( @xmath31 ) with only a small contribution from the fn * t*-matrices .",
    "in contrast , the born completion for the quadrupole and induced - dipole interactions was found to be negligible : high - partial waves were found to increase cross sections for @xmath53 by less than 2% .",
    "this clearly shows that cross sections for dipole forbidden transitions converge rapidly with respect to the partial wave expansion , as observed in the case of molecular ions ( e.g. faure & tennyson 2001 ) . as a result",
    ", only the born - closure approximation for the dipole interaction was implemented in the computation of the integral rotational cross sections .    in fig .  2",
    ", we compare our integral cross sections with those of jain & norcross ( 1985 ) and saha et al .",
    "excellent agreement is observed down to 0.01  ev . at lower energy",
    ", we adopted the extrapolation formula of rabadn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( eq .  1 of their paper ) which was calibrated using the rotational close - coupling results of saha et al .",
    "this procedure obviously introduces uncertainties in the rate calculation at temperatures below about 100  k , in addition to closed - channels effects which are completely ignored in the present treatment .",
    "hence , rate coefficients below 100  k are expected to be less accurate than at higher temperatures .",
    "a large shape resonance can be observed in fig .  2 at about 2.8  ev .",
    "it is particularly strong for transitions with small cross sections , i.e. those with @xmath54 .",
    "this resonance ( of @xmath55 symmetry ) has also been observed experimentally , as discussed in varambhia & tennyson ( 2007 ) . for hnc",
    ", it appears at a slightly lower position of 2.5  ev .",
    "it is to be noted that the cross sections for @xmath2 are much larger than for the other transitions due to the dominance of the long - range dipole interaction for very polar molecules .",
    "we finally note that , to our knowledge , there is no data ( theoretical or experimental ) on the rotational excitation of dcn , hnc and dnc available in literature .      as hcn and hnc ( hence dcn and dnc )",
    "have their first electronic excitation threshold at 6.63  ev and 6.20  ev , respectively , the rotational excitation cross sections were computed in the range 0.01@xmath06.2  ev and extrapolated down to rotational thresholds ( see section  3.1 ) . assuming that the electron velocity distribution is maxwellian , rate coefficients were obtained for temperatures in the range 5@xmath06000  k and for transitions among all levels up to @xmath15=8 .",
    "de - excitation rates were calculated using the detailed balance relation . for later use in modelling , the temperature dependence of the downward transition rates @xmath56 , in units of cm@xmath22s@xmath58 ,",
    "was fitted to the analytic form ( faure et al .",
    "2004a ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath16 is restricted to the range 5@xmath02000  k in order to achieve a fitting accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the coefficients \\{a@xmath62 } , in units such that @xmath63 is in cm@xmath22s@xmath58 , obtained from the fitting procedure are given in tables 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 for hcn , dcn , hnc and dnc , respectively .",
    "fitting coefficients for temperatures above 2000  k and @xmath64 can be obtained upon request to the authors .    [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it can be noticed in tables  5@xmath08 that in addition to the @xmath65 propensity rule , there is a rigorous selection rule at the ios level : the @xmath66 transitions are strictly forbidden , following properties of wigner-@xmath44 symbols .",
    "monteiro & stutzki ( 1986 ) have shown that for he@xmath0hcn this selection rule becomes only a propensity rule at the close - coupling level .",
    "finally we note that the influence of collisional processes on hcn hyperfine anomalies is still a matter of debate in the literature ( e.g. gonzles - alfonso & cernicharo 1993 ; turner 2001 ; daniel , cernicharo & dubernet 2006 ) .",
    "future radiative transfer studies including the present hyperfine rates will thus help to further assess the role of collision - induced transitions between hcn hyperfine levels . in this context , it is important to remember that h@xmath12@xmath0hcn collisional rates are currently obtained by scaling he@xmath0hcn rates by the reduced mass ratio . while for para - h@xmath12(@xmath15=0 ) this assumption is probably qualitatively correct , rates for h@xmath67 might be significantly different , as found for example in the case of h@xmath68h@xmath12o ( faure et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , it is worth stressing that rates for excitation of hcn by h atoms and h@xmath12o molecules are completely unknown .",
    "we have calculated electron - impact rotational and hyperfine ( de)excitation rates for isotopologues of hcn and hnc .",
    "these calculations are based on the molecular * r*-matrix method combined with the ( threshold corrected ) anr approximation .",
    "our results show that such collisions are essentially dominated by dipolar transitions owing to the large dipole moments of the considered species . however , short - range effects are important and were included via * r*-matrix wavefunctions as corrections to the born approximation .",
    "dipole forbidden transitions have thus appreciable rates which can not be neglected in any detailed population models of isotopologues of hcn and hnc .",
    "in particular , we have shown that electron - impact rates are crucial for modelling environments where the electron fraction is larger than 10@xmath4 . in this context , we note the recent suggestion by jimenez - serra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to use rotational emissions of hco@xmath5 , hcn and hnc to probe electron densities in c - type shocks .",
    "the present rates should help to investigate in more detail the electron density enhancements expected during the first stages of a c - type shock evolution .",
    "finally , our work might help to understand and to model the observed variable hcn / hnc ratio in comets ( biver et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) ."
