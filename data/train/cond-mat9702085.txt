    "the concept of scaling supports much of our current conceptualization on the general subject of how complex systems formed of interacting subunits behave .",
    "this concept was developed a quarter century ago by physicists interested in the behavior of a system near its critical point .",
    "progress was made possible by a remarkable combination of experiment and phenomenological theory . in the preceding paper we presented empirical results suggesting that the scaling concept can be useful in describing economic systems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present models which may lead to an understanding of the underlying mechanism behind the scaling laws .    in the preceding paper ,",
    "we used the compustat database to study all united states ( us ) manufacturing publicly - traded firms from 1974 to 1993 .",
    "the compustat database contains @xmath4 years of data on all publicly - traded companies in the us .",
    "we found that the distribution of firm sizes remains stable for the 20 years we study , i.e. , the mean value and standard deviation remain approximately constant .",
    "we studied the distribution of sizes of the `` new '' companies in each year and found it to be well approximated by a log - normal .",
    "however , we find ( i ) the distribution of the logarithm of the growth rates , for a growth period of one year , and for companies with approximately the same size @xmath5 displays an exponential form @xcite @xmath6 and ( ii ) the fluctuations in the growth rates  measured by the width of this distribution @xmath7  scale as a power law @xcite , @xmath8 here @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the size of the company in the next year , and @xmath11 is the standard deviation ( width ) of the distribution ( [ e - distribution ] ) .",
    "we found that the exponent @xmath0 takes the same value , within the error bars , for several measures of the size of a company .",
    "in particular , we obtained : @xmath12 for `` sales . ''    in this paper , we present and discuss models that , although very simple , give some insight into these empirical results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we discuss a model that predicts an exponential distribution of growth rates . in sect .",
    "iii , we study a hierarchical tree model that predicts the power law dependence of @xmath7 on size . in sect .",
    "iv , we discuss how the two models can be combined so that a single model predicts both of our central empirical findings . in sect .",
    "v , we summarize our findings and suggest avenues for future research . the paper contains three appendices .",
    "appendix a discusses the relationship between the standard deviations of the growth rate and the logarithmic growth rate .",
    "appendices b and c give more details of the analytical solution of the hierarchical tree model .",
    "as described above , one of our central findings is that the distribution of growth rates for companies of a given initial size has an exponential form .",
    "the result is surprising because the sales of organizations as large as publicly traded corporations reflect a large number of factors .",
    "while those factors are not necessarily independent and while the growth of any one company might be dominated by a single factor , one might nonetheless expect a gaussian distribution for growth rates .    in this section ,",
    "we show how a plausible modification of gibrat s assumptions @xcite could lead to eq .",
    "we relax the assumption of uncorrelated growth rates and assume that the successive growth rates are correlated in such a way that the size of a company is `` attracted '' to an optimal size @xmath13 .",
    "this value is reminiscent of the minimum point of a `` u - shaped '' average cost curve in conventional economic theory and should evolve only slowly in time ( on the scale of years ) @xcite .",
    "let us then consider a set of companies all having initial sales @xmath5 . as time passes ,",
    "the sales of each of the firms varies from day to day ( or over another time interval much less than 1 year ) , but tend to stay in the neighborhood of @xmath13 . in the simplest case , the growth process has a constant `` back - drift , '' i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant larger than one and @xmath16 is an uncorrelated gaussian random number with zero mean and variance @xmath17 .",
    "these dynamics are similar to what is known in economics as regression towards the mean @xcite , although this formulation is not standard in economics .    written in terms of the logarithmic growth rate @xmath18 , eq .",

    "we show how a model of management hierarchies can predict eq .",
    "( [ e - sigma ] ) . in economics",
    ", it is generally presumed that the growth of firms is determined by changes in demand and production costs .",
    "since these features are specific to individual markets , it is surprising that a law as simple as equation eq .",
    "( [ e - sigma ] ) governs the growth rate of firms operating in much different markets .",
    "while demand and technology vary across markets , virtually all firms have a hierarchical decision structure .",
    "one possible explanation for why there is a simple law that governs the growth rate of all manufacturing firms is that the growth process is dominated by properties of management hierarchies @xcite .",
    "this focus on the technology of management rather then technology of production as a basis for understanding firm growth is reminiscent of lucas model of the size distribution of firms @xcite .    at the outset",
    "let us acknowledge a tension between our empirical results and the theoretical model in this section . in our companion paper and in the preceding section , we analyze the scaling properties of the distribution of the logarithmic growth rate @xmath41 and its standard deviation @xmath7 . in this section",
    "we view companies as consisting of many business units . since the sales of a company are the sum of the sales of individual units rather than their product , it is more convenient to analyze the standard deviation of the annual firm size change rather then the logarithmic growth rate .",
    "let @xmath42 be the standard deviation of end - of - period size for initial size @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath43 and since @xmath44 , it follows that @xmath45 .",
    "as discussed in appendix a , @xmath7 must be small for this approximation to hold .",
    "let us start by assuming that every company , regardless of its size , is made up of similarly sized units .",
    "thus , a company of size @xmath5 is on average made up of @xmath46 units , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the size of unit @xmath49 .",
    "we further assume that the annual size change @xmath50 of each unit follows a bounded distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath51 , which is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to notice that throughout this section and the following we consider @xmath52 , to insure that sizes of units remain positive .",
    "since some divisions after several cycles of growth may shrink almost to zero , while others grow several times , we assume that companies dynamically reorganize themselves so that they begin each period with approximately equal - sized divisions and the inequality @xmath52 holds .",
    "if the annual size changes of the different units are independent , then the model is trivial .",
    "using the fact that @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 the second moment of the distribution is given by @xmath55 where we used again the fact that the @xmath50 s are centered and independent .",
    "thus , the variance in the size of the company is @xmath56 using the fact that @xmath57 ( see appendix a ) , it follows that @xmath58 .",
    "the much smaller value of @xmath0 that we find indicates the presence of strong positive correlations among a company s units .",
    "we can understand this result by considering the tree - like hierarchical organization of a typical company @xcite .",
    "the head of the tree represents the head of the company , whose policy is passed to the level beneath , and so on , until finally the units in the lowest level take action .",
    "these units have again a mean size of @xmath59 and annual size changes with zero mean and variance of @xmath51 . here",
    "we assume for simplicity that at every level other than the lowest each node is connected to exactly @xmath2 units in the next lowest level .",
    "then the number of units @xmath60 is equal to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the number of levels ( see fig .",
    "[ f - tree ] ) .",
    "what are the consequences of this simple model ?",
    "let us first assume that the head of the company suggests a policy that could result in changing the size of each unit in the lowest level by an amount @xmath63 . if this policy is propagated through the hierarchy without any modifications , then it is the same as assuming in eq .",
    "( [ e - sigma - ind2 ] ) that all the @xmath50 s are identical .",
    "this implies that @xmath64 from which follows @xmath65 and we conclude that @xmath66 .",
    "of course , it is not realistic to expect that all decisions in an organization would be perfectly coordinated as if they were all dictated by a single `` boss . '' hierarchies might be specifically designed to take advantage of information at different levels ; and mid - level managers might even be instructed to deviate from decisions made at a higher level if they have information that strongly suggests that an alternative decision would be superior . another possible explanation for some independence in decision - making is organizational failure , due either to poor communication or disobedience .",
    "= 0.8      to model the intermediate case between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , let us assume that the head of a company makes a decision to change the size of the units of a company by an amount @xmath63 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath63 , for the set of all companies , has zero mean and variance @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , we consider that each manager at the nodes of the hierarchical tree follows his supervisor s policy with a probability @xmath3 , while with probability @xmath69 imposes a new _ independent _ policy .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the manager acting as the head of a smaller company made up of the units under his supervision .",
    "hence the size of the company becomes a random variable with a standard deviation that can be computed either with numerical simulations or using recursion relations among the levels of the tree .",
    "since the calculations are somewhat involved , we include them in appendix b for the interested reader ( see also refs .",
    "the main result is that the variance of the fluctuations in a @xmath62-level hierarchical tree is given by @xmath70    if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 dominates the growth , and we get @xmath73 which implies @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath75 , then @xmath76 is the dominant term , and we obtain @xmath77 which implies @xmath68 .    finally , we can write , for @xmath78 , that the hierarchical model leads to @xmath79 even for small @xmath62 , we find that eq .",
    "( [ e - model2 ] ) is a good approximation  e.g. , while for @xmath80 and @xmath81 we predict @xmath82 , when we take @xmath83 the deviation from the predicted value is only @xmath84 , i.e. , about @xmath85 .",
    "= 0.8    equation ( [ e - model2 ] ) is confirmed in the two limiting cases : when @xmath86 ( absolute control ) @xmath67 , while for all @xmath87 , decisions at the upper levels of management have no statistical effect on decisions made at lower levels , and @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , for a given value of @xmath89 the control level @xmath3 will be a decreasing function of @xmath2 : @xmath90 , cf . fig .",
    "[ f - phase ] .",
    "for example , if we choose the empirical value @xmath91 , then eq . ( [ e - model2 ] ) predicts the plausible result @xmath92 for a range of @xmath2 in the interval @xmath93 .",
    "we started with two central empirical findings about firm growth rates .",
    "the model in section ii predicts one of those findings ( the shape of the distribution ) and the model in section iii predicts the other ( the power law dependence of the standard deviation of output on firm size ) .",
    "this section addresses the relationship between the two models .",
    "first , we address concerns that the models might be contradictory and show that they are not .",
    "then , we show how the models can be combined into a single model that predicts both of our empirical findings .    in the tree model ,",
    "firm growth rates are potentially the result of many independent decisions . as a result",
    ", one might expect that the central limit theorem would imply a gaussian distribution of firm output .",
    "in fact , however , the distribution of outputs is not necessarily gaussian .    to address the distribution of firm output in the tree model ,",
    "it is necessary to make an assumption about the distribution from which each independent growth decision is drawn .",
    "no such assumption is needed to analyze the standard deviation of firm growth rates , but is needed to analyze the shape of the distribution .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show the distribution of the inputs ( i.e. , of each independent decision ) and the outputs for a tree with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . we find that for gaussian distributed inputs , the output is not gaussian in the tails .",
    "this finding is remarkable .",
    "first of all , with @xmath94 and @xmath96 , the firm consists of 1024 units . with a probability to disobey of @xmath97",
    ", one would expect @xmath98 of the units to , on average , make independent decisions about their growth rates .",
    "thus , even for non - gaussian inputs , one can hypothesize that the output is close to gaussian .",
    "moreover , for gaussian inputs , the sum of independent gaussians is itself gaussian .",
    "thus , for every particular configuration of the disobeying links , the output distribution is gaussian with variance @xmath99 , which is a function of this random configuration .",
    "however , there are @xmath100 possible configurations of links each of which produce a gaussian distribution with different integer @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102    which is no longer gaussian for the observed form of @xmath103 .",
    "= 0.8    = 0.8    = 0.8    figure 4 shows the probability @xmath103 to get a tree with given @xmath101 computed for all trees with a given number of levels @xmath62 , @xmath104 , and @xmath80 . as visually apparent in fig .  4",
    ", this probability density is a non - trivial function , which is discussed in more detail in appendix c. the final distribution of the firm output @xmath10 will be thus given by the convolution of two densities : @xmath103 and gaussian with variance @xmath99    in a general case , it can be shown by martingale theory @xcite that for any input distribution @xmath105 with zero mean and finite variance @xmath51 , the output distribution converges for @xmath106 to a distribution @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a function that does not depend on @xmath62 but depends on @xmath109 .",
    "thus , we can not expect to obtain a result that the output distribution must be exponential regardless of the input distribution .",
    "it would , however , be desirable to find some simple input distribution that yields the output distribution that we actually observe .",
    "figure 3 also shows the output distribution when the input distribution is exponential in terms of @xmath110 . for small @xmath7",
    ", it practically coincides with eq .",
    "( [ model12 ] ) . in this case , the output distribution is nearly exponential , and the slightly fatter wings that we observe are arguably consistent with our empirical results .",
    "thus , in the limit of small @xmath7 , we can combine the models of the two sections by assuming that the dynamic process described in sect .",
    "ii provides the input distribution for the tree model in sect .",
    "this additional assumption in the tree model then predicts both of our empirical findings . for large @xmath7 ,",
    "the direct combination of two models needs additional fine - tuning .",
    "the two central results of our previous paper are that the distribution of company growth rates is exponential and the standard deviation of growth rates scales as a power law of firm size with scaling exponent @xmath111 .",
    "any realistic theory of the firm in economics must be consistent with these empirical findings . in this paper",
    ", we have presented simple models that are consistent with our empirical findings .",
    "indeed , the models have only two key assumptions .",
    "one is that each company has a natural size and the other is that decisions in hierarchical organizations are positively but imperfectly correlated .",
    "these models suggest that very simple mechanisms may provide insight into our empirical findings .",
    "one limitation of the model in this paper is that it only predicts our results about one year growth rates .",
    "a complete model of the firm would also predict the distribution of growth rates over longer horizons .",
    "we believe that extending this model to additional periods would not provide a complete description of firm dynamics . in reality",
    ", the standard deviation of growth rates goes up as the time horizon increases .",
    "the attraction in our model to a stable company size prevents the distribution from spreading over time as much as we actually observe .",
    "we thank r. n. mantegna for important help in the early stages of this work , and jnict ( l.a . ) , dfg ( h.l .",
    "and p.m. ) , and nsf for financial support .",
    "the theory in section iii establishes results about the standard deviation of the growth rate .",
    "our empirical results in the earlier paper concerned the standard deviation of the logarithmic growth rate defined as @xmath112 .",
    "this appendix establishes the exact relationship between the standard deviation of the growth rate and the standard deviation of the logarithmic growth rate .",
    "thus we will compute the width of the distribution of final sizes @xmath113 , that we designate by @xmath42 .",
    "we can express @xmath114 as @xmath115 taking @xmath116 , and assuming that the standard deviation of the distribution is small ( @xmath117 which holds for companies with sales larger than @xmath118 dollars , ) simple integrations lead to @xmath119 and @xmath120 replacing these results onto ( [ e - s1 ] ) and expanding in taylor series , we obtain @xmath121 thus , to first order , we obtain @xmath122",

''",
    "thus , the number of units of the company that follow the policy of the head of the company @xmath123 can be related to the well known problem of the number of male descendents of a family after @xmath62 generations @xcite .",
    "the solution is that for a @xmath62-level tree with @xmath2 branches the average number of units at the end is given by    @xmath124    now , let us look at the problem of calculating @xmath42 .",
    "our problem is slightly more complicated since it includes double averaging over all realizations of growth rates of independent units and over all possible configurations of the tree .",
    "let us look at the @xmath125 level of a tree with a certain configuration of obeying and disobeying links .",
    "we can define clusters of units connected to one another through obeying links .",

    "a cluster of size @xmath127 in the @xmath137 level is connected to @xmath138 units in the @xmath62-level ; @xmath139 of the links are obeying , while @xmath140 are disobeying .",
    "the obeying links will give rise to a cluster of size @xmath139 in level @xmath62 , while the disobeying links give rise to @xmath140 clusters of size one .",

    "<S> then , we study a hierarchical tree - like model of a company that enables us to relate the two parameters of the model to the exponent @xmath0 , which describes the dependence of the standard deviation of the distribution of growth rates on size . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 defines the mean branching ratio of the hierarchical tree and @xmath3 is the probability that the lower levels follow the policy of higher levels in the hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the distribution of growth rates of this hierarchical model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the distribution is consistent with the exponential form found empirically . </S>"
