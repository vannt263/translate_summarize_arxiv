    "biological evolution of species presents some universal behaviour due to its time - and - size scaleless character ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . a parallel between this feature and critical phenomena studied within statistical physics",
    "is straightforward , and indeed many techniques traditionally used by physicists in this field were recently adopted also to study evolution through simple computer models ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "two of the most important lessons physicists have learnt from critical phenomena are listed below .",
    "lesson 1 : one * can not * take only a small piece ( or a small time interval ) of the system under study , including later the rest of the system as a perturbation . critical , scale - free systems resist to this approach , because they are non - linear , the whole is not simply the sum of the parts .",
    "all scales of size ( and time ) are equally important for the behaviour of the whole system .",
    "a would - be upper bound for size ( or lifetime ) , above which one can neglect the corresponding effects , does not exist .",
    "lesson 2 : the specific microscopic ( or short term ) details of the system are not definitive to determine the behaviour of the whole system under a macroscopic ( or long term ) point of view . in other words , systems which are completely different in their microscopic constituents ( or short term evolution rules )",
    "can present the same critical , macroscopic behaviour .",
    "in particular , some universal critical exponents determine a mathematical behaviour that is shared by completely distinct systems .",
    "thus , one can indirectly study some aspects of a complicated real system by observing the evolution of an artificially invented toy model simulated on the computer .",
    "there are many evidences for this scale - free behaviour within biological evolution . among others ,",
    "a famous example is the classification of extinct genera according to their lifetime , a long term study of fossil data performed by paleontologists john sepkoski and david raup @xcite .",
    "the frequency distribution they found is compatible with a power - law decay with exponent 2 .",
    "the same exponent was confirmed by at least two distinct theoretical computer models @xcite .    branching processes in general",
    "also show scale - free behaviour . in this case ,",
    "an important class , with exponents multiple of @xmath2 , is ubiquitous .",
    "this interesting issue was studied by g.b .",
    "west and collaborators , a recent overview can be found in @xcite . in particular , by studying blood transport networks , they proposed a model based on three basic ingredients : a hierarchical branching pattern , where a vessel bifurcates into smaller vessels and so on ; a minimum cut - off size for the smallest branches , which makes the branching mechanism a finite process ; and a free - energy minimisation constraint .",
    "from these three basic hypotheses , they were able to show the emergence of the exponents @xmath3 , etc @xcite .",
    "of course , not only blood vessel systems follow this general framework , and the same class of exponents multiple of @xmath2 were indeed measured within many other contexts .",
    "a particularly intriguing example is the so - called kleiber s empirical law , discovered in 1932 .",
    "it relates the metabolic energetic power @xmath4 of an animal ( mammal ) with its mass @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "the validity of this relation goes down to single isolated mammalian cells and even its isolated mitochondrian , covering 26 orders of magnitude @xcite . also",
    ", lifespan increases with @xmath7 for many organisms , while heart - rate decreases with @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the number of heart - beats during the whole life is invariant for all mammals .",
    "similar scaling relations and invariant quantities appear at the molecular level as well @xcite .    here",
    ", we raise the idea that biological speciation could fit very well into the general branching process framework described by west",
    ". why would the idea of universality apply to evolutionary systems is an interesting and important conceptual question .",
    "some hints towards a possible answer can be seen in @xcite .    in the present work , in order to test this possible link between biological speciation and west s framework , we address such a complicated problem , namely lineage branching , following the quoted toy model approach .",
    "our hope is that some of the quantities we can measure could have a parallel in the real world , in particular the critical exponents . besides the computer simulations from which we measure these quantities and their related critical exponents , we were also able to relate them with each other .",
    "this further analytical treatment yields some scaling relations which are completely fullfilled by our simulational results .",
    "furthermore , these relations allow us to predict the unknown values of some exponents from the knowledge of others , an approach which could be very useful since only one such exponent was directly measured by fossil data , namely from the sepkoski and raup work .",
    "first , we present the model , then the results of our computer simulations and analytical approaches .",
    "conclusions are at the end .",
    "our population is kept constant , with @xmath4 ( typically @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) individuals representing a sample of a much larger set .",
    "each individual is characterised only by its genome , represented here by an array of @xmath11 bits ( typicaly 32 , 64 , 128 @xmath12 2048 ) .",
    "each bit can either be set ( 1-bit ) or not ( 0-bit ) . at the beginning ,",
    "all bits are zeroed , and all individuals belong to a single lineage .",
    "we count the total number @xmath13 of bits set along the genome of individual @xmath14 : it will * survive * with probability @xmath15 , which decreases exponentially for increasing values of @xmath13 , i.e. the larger the number of 1-bits along the genome , the larger is the death probability of this particular individual .",
    "this is the selection ingredient of our model . at each time step ,",
    "a certain fraction @xmath16 ( typically 1% or 2% ) of individuals die , each one according to its own death probability , as the outcome of intralineage competition .    at each time step",
    ", the simulation obtains the value of @xmath17 first , before the death cycle , by solving the polynomial equation    @xmath18    where the sum runs over all living individuals .",
    "this requirement keeps the population constant .",
    "equivalently , one can solve    @xmath19    where now the sum runs over @xmath20 ( 0 , 1 , 2 @xmath12 ) , and @xmath21 counts the current number of individuals with precisely @xmath20 bits set along the genome .",
    "after computing the value of @xmath17 , we scan the whole population ( @xmath14 = 1 , 2 @xmath22 ) , tossing a real random number between 0 and 1 for each individual @xmath14 , in order to compare it with its survival probability : if the random number is larger than @xmath15 , individual @xmath14 dies .",
    "after each death , we choose another individual at random to be the parent of a newborn . its genome is copied , and some random mutations are included at a fixed rate per bit ( typically 1/32 ) which does not depend on the genome length .",
    "each mutation flips the current bit state ( from 0 to 1 or vice - versa ) at a position tossed along the genome .",
    "after all mutations are performed , the newborn is included into the population .    if the newborn presents fewer 1-bits than its parent , it receives the label of potential founder of a new lineage . during the time steps that follow , all its descendents will be monitored : if , at some future time , the number of those descendents still alive reaches a minimum threshold @xmath23 ( typically 10 ) , then all descendents of the now confirmed founder , including itself , are considered to belong to a new lineage .    on the other hand , extinction occurs when the last individual of a given lineage dies .",
    "although a rare event , a lineage can also become extinct if all its individuals descend from the same potential founder , being altogether transferred to another , new , lineage , by reaching the threshold @xmath23 .    a similar model , but without the lineage branching step , was already used by some of us @xcite .",
    "we have run our program with some different sets of parameters @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath25 .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same in all cases , thus we will present only results for populations with @xmath26 individuals , @xmath27 of which die every year ( immediately replaced by newborns ) , requiring a minimum threshold of @xmath28 living descendents of the same potential founder in order to have a new lineage .",
    "the genome lengths vary from @xmath29 up to @xmath30 .",
    "we have also studied an alternate version of the model in which , instead of being strictly constant , the population is allowed to fluctuate : first , all individuals have the chance to generate offspring , according to the rate @xmath16 , increasing the population ; after that , the death roulette kills individuals according to the probability @xmath31 .",
    "no change is observed in what concerns the quantities we measured below .",
    "also , similar branching criteria were introduced into the penna model for biological ageing @xcite , for smaller genome lengths @xmath32 , 16 , 32 and 64 : the general behaviour did not change .",
    "figure 1 shows the number of living lineages as a function of time @xmath33 .",
    "each time step corresponds to a scan of the whole population performing deaths and births .",
    "we divided the number of living lineages by the constant number of individuals , in order to show that one lineage indeed corresponds to a considerable number of individuals ( varying from approximately ten thousand , on average , for the largest genome length of 2048 bits , down to fifty individuals for the smallest genome length of 32 bits ) .",
    "one can also observe that the total number of generations we tested , after one million time steps , is large enough to get a stable , self - organised situation which is , indeed , very different from the starting point , with a single lineage and completely clean genomes .    over the last one hundred thousand time steps , after stabilisation , we have performed the average of the number of living lineages for each genome length .",
    "the results are displayed in figure 2 .",
    "the exponent that figures in the plot was obtained from a fit to the simulation data . for other runs , with different sets of parameters",
    ", it remained the same .",
    "the relation between these two quantities ( number @xmath34 of living lineages and genome length @xmath11 ) follows a power - law of the kind    @xmath35    here , we propose that the numerically determined value @xmath36 ( error bar within the last digit ) is in fact @xmath37 , falling into the same family of simple multiples of 1/4 , ubiquitous among biological measurements of various kinds ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as already quoted , g. west and collaborators demonstrated the emergence of exponents multiple of @xmath2 based only on three fundamental ingredients .",
    "our lineage model shares the same ingredients , namely :    \\1 ) a multiple hierarchical branching  in our case , lineages born from others ;    \\2 ) a size invariant limit for the final branch  in our case , we require a fixed minimum population @xmath23 in order to have branching ;    \\3 ) a free - energy minimisation process  in our case , the growing - entropy tendency provided by the random mutations ( in the direction of randomising the bits along the genome as time goes by ) is balanced by the selection mechanism ( which gives preference to individuals with the smallest possible number of 1-bits ) .    figure 3 illustrates this last ingredient . by counting the number of 1-bits along each genome ,",
    "the results are distributed far below half of the whole length @xmath11 ( which would be the maximum - entropy situation ) , showing the efficiency of the selection process . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - vanishing width observed in the same distributions shows a high degree of genetic diversity preserved within the survivors , even when the genome length is varied .",
    "note that , with the exception of the three smallest genome lengths ( symbols ) , all other curves ( small black dots ) collapse into a single , genome - length - independent one , within the figure scale .",
    "figure 4 shows the number of lineages which become extinct each year , as a function of time .",
    "extinction becomes more difficult for larger genome lengths .",
    "figure 5 shows the total number @xmath20 of extinct lineages , during the whole one - million - time - step history , as a function of the genome length .",
    "again , we observe a power - law behaviour according to the general trend    @xmath38    figure 6 shows the distributions of extinct lineages as a function of their sizes .",
    "one observes again a power - law behaviour with exponent very close to 1 ( even for parameters other than the ones used for this particular plot ) .",
    "the exponents obtained from a fit to the data corresponding to the largest genome lengths are shown .",
    "the position of the peak does not change when the genome length is increased , in agreement with our criterion for branching , namely a fixed minimum number @xmath23 of living individuals .",
    "thus , in the limit of large populations and large genome lengths , the probability distribution of lineages size @xmath39 is expected to be    @xmath40    the value of @xmath41 can be exactly 1 or slightly larger than 1 , and the constant @xmath42 does not depend on the genome length .",
    "the distribution of lineage lifetime , figure 7 , is different .",
    "its peak position * does * depend on the genome length @xmath11 . at the same limit of large populations and large genome lengths",
    ", its probability @xmath43 reads    @xmath44^{\\alpha-1}\\,\\ ,   \\ell^{-\\alpha}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , { \\rm if}\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\ell \\ge \\ell_0(g ) , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , { \\rm where}\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\alpha \\approx 2\\\\       & = &   0\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , { \\rm otherwise}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    again , @xmath45 can be exactly 2 or slightly larger than 2 .",
    "this value is in complete agreement with the real exponent found by paleontologists john sepkoski and david raup from fossil data .",
    "the multiplicative constant in front of @xmath46 can be easily obtained by integrating equation ( 6 ) and equating the result to unity : for @xmath47 , it coincides with the minimum cutoff lifetime @xmath48 itself .",
    "the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath11 also follows a power - law behaviour    @xmath50    as can be seen , for instance , by plotting the peak positions on figure 7 against @xmath11 . alternatively , and with better accuracy",
    ", one can plot the average lifetime against @xmath11 .",
    "the exponent we get from this plot ( not shown ) is 0.26 , for our simulational data .",
    "indeed , a simple reasoning can link the number @xmath51 of living lineages at a given time , equation ( 3 ) , with the number @xmath52 of extinct lineages during the whole history , equation ( 4 ) .",
    "the former can be counted by adding the probability of each lineage @xmath53 to be alive at a given time , i.e. its lifetime @xmath54 divided by the whole historical time @xmath55 ,    @xmath56    considering @xmath57 , we get    @xmath58    and the consequent scaling relation    @xmath59    which holds in general ( apart from small logarithmic corrections , if @xmath60 ) .",
    "this relation is very well verified by our numerical data .",
    "the ratio 2:1 we found between the exponents @xmath45 and @xmath41 governing the two probability distributions for lineages ( according to their lifetime or size ) has an interesting interpretation .",
    "the growth of the number of lineages is not restricted by the finite size of the whole population .",
    "each lineage grows by itself , reaches its maximum number of individuals , and then shrinks up to extinction due to its own genetic meltdown .",
    "if the maximum number of living individuals belonging to a lineage was somehow limited by an external source , then this maximum would be kept for a long time , waiting for the unavoidable genetic meltdown which eventually leads to extinction : in this case , the relation between lineage size @xmath61 and lifetime @xmath62 would be linear .",
    "on the contrary , we obtain a relation    @xmath63    in agreement with the ratio @xmath64 we got previously from the lifetime and size distribution probabilities , separately .",
    "we have measured @xmath65 independently , by accumulating a @xmath66 $ ] histogram of all lineages , an example of which is shown in the table , for a genome length of 64 .",
    "lineages live in a narrow stripe of the space @xmath66 $ ] , near the line defined by equation ( 11 ) . for all genome lengths",
    ", @xmath65 is always very close to 2 , according to our simulational data .",
    ".probability distribution of species as a function of lifetime @xmath62 and size @xmath61 .",
    "fractions smaller than 0.0001 are not shown . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     by using the identity @xmath67 , one can also show the further relation    @xmath68^\\omega\\,\\,\\,\\ , , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\",

    "we study a simple population dynamics model where the genome of each individual is represented by a bit - string .",
    "the survival probability decreases with the number of 1-bits along the individual s genome . at each time step ,",
    "a certain fraction of individuals die according to these probabilities , and are replaced by survival s offspring .",
    "the genome of each offspring is a copy of the parent s , with a few random mutations .",
    "lineage branching occurs when an offspring happens to have a genome better than its parent , provided its own descendence succeeds in growing up to surpass a threshold of living individuals .    by simulating this simple model on a computer , we find some general power - law relations which seem to be * independent * of the particular parameters adopted in the simulations , and also of modifications of the dynamic rules themselves .",
    "one of these power - laws , namely equation ( 6 ) describing the distribution of extinct lineages per lifetime , agrees with real paleontological data @xcite , for which the exponent @xmath73 also agrees with our numerically determined value .",
    "no real data is available in order to compare the other exponents we measured ( equations 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 and 11 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we were also able to obtain some analytical scaling relations between these various exponents , all of them in agreement with our numerical data .",
    "moreover , within our narrow error bars , all these exponents are multiple of @xmath2 , in complete agreement with the general framework theoretically studied by west _",
    "et al _ @xcite in a different context .",
    "these authors show the emergence of exponents multiple of @xmath2 , which are ubiquitous within biological systems , based only on three very general assumptions also shared by our model .",
    "thus , we propose these exponents could be universal , valid for other evolutionary systems more complicated than our toy model .",
