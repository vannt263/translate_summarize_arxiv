    "there has been recently an increasing interest for study of systems with a finite chiral density , namely @xmath10 .",
    "such chirality imbalance can be obtained dynamically because of the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly  @xcite when fermions interact with nontrivial gauge field configurations characterized by a topological index named the winding number , @xmath11 . in the context of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) such nontrivial gauge field configurations at finite temperature in minkowski space are named sphalerons , whose production rate has been estimated to be quite large  @xcite . the large number of sphaleron transitions in high temperature suggests the possibility that net chirality might be abundant ( locally ) in the quark - gluon plasma phase of qcd ; when one couples this thermal qcd bath with an external strong magnetic field , @xmath1 , produced in the early stages of heavy ion collisions , the coexistence of @xmath12 and @xmath13 might lead to a charge separation phenonemon named the chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite which has been observed experimentally in zirconium pentatelluride  @xcite . beside cme other interesting effects related to anomaly and chiral imbalance can be found in  @xcite .    in order to describe systems with finite chirality in thermodynamical equilibrium",
    ", it is customary to introduce a chiral chemical potential , @xmath5 , conjugated to the @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the chiral chemical potential describes a system in which chiral density is in thermodynamical equilibrium ; however because of anomaly as well as of chirality changing processes due to finite quark condensate , @xmath4 is not a strictly conserved quantity hence the meaning of @xmath5 is not so clear ; however naming @xmath9 the typical time scale in which chirality changing processes take place , one might assume that @xmath14 describes a system in thermodynamical equilibrium with a fixed value of @xmath4 on a time scale much larger than @xmath9 , the latter representing the time scale needed for @xmath4 to equilibrate .",
    "in this article we study chiral phase transition and chiral density production in the context of quark matter in a background static and homogeneous parallel electric , @xmath0 , and magnetic , @xmath1 , fields .",
    "one of our goal is to investigate the effect of the background fields on chiral symmetry breaking at zero temperature , and on the critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration , @xmath15 .",
    "this part of the study embraces previous studies about chiral symmetry breaking / restoration in the background of external fields  @xcite , completing them by adding the computation of the critical temperature versus the strengh of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the effect of the electric field is to lower the critical temperature , in agreement with the scenario of inverse catalysis depicted in @xcite where however the zero temperature case has only been considered ; the inverse catalysis scenario does not change considerably when the magnetic field is added , as long as the magnetic field is not very large compared to the electric one .",
    "this finding is in agreement with a previous study at zero temperature  @xcite where the role of the second electromagnetic invariant , @xmath16 , has been recognized as inhibitor of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we are also interested to study the effect of chiral density on the thermodynamics of the system .",
    "the model studied here has the advantage that a chiral density is obtained dynamically without the need to introduce , _ a priori _ , a chiral chemical potential . as a matter of fact",
    "chirality can be produced combining @xmath0 which produces pairs via the schwinger mechanism , and @xmath1 which alignes particles spin along its direction .",
    "the mechanism producing chirality is very simple : we assume for sake of simplicity a very large @xmath1 , so that only the lowest landau level ( lll ) is occupied ; moreover we assume the system made only of one flavor of quarks , namely @xmath17 quarks , and we focus on a single @xmath18 created by the schwinger effect .",
    "the @xmath17 quark must have its spin aligned along @xmath1 because it sits in the lll , and its momentum will be initially rather parallel or antiparallel to @xmath1 , so the initial helicity can be either positive or negative . on the other hand the effect of @xmath19 is to accelerate @xmath17 along the direction of @xmath1 so after some time @xmath17 quark will have positive helicity .",
    "an analogous discussion can be done for the @xmath20 .",
    "therefore as a consequence of the schwinger effect , lll and @xmath19 each time a pair is created , there is an increase of a factor two of the net chiral density of the system .",
    "the dynamical evolution of @xmath4 produced by this mechanism can be computed explicitly  @xcite and it has been shown to be the one expected from the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly : this is not surprising because @xmath21 meaning that axial current is not conserved at the quantum level and @xmath4 should evolve according to the anomaly equation . if @xmath4 evolution was governed only by the anomaly , however , there would be no chance for reaching a thermodynamical equilibrium because @xmath4 would grow indefinitely ( assuming the fields as external fields and neglecting any backreaction from the fermion currents ) .",
    "but in the thermal bath there are also chirality flipping processes related to the existence of the chiral condensate as well as of the finite current quark mass : we introduce a relaxation time for chirality , namely @xmath9 , giving the time scale necessary for the equilibration of @xmath4 . then it is possible to show that for times @xmath22 chiral density equilibrates to @xmath23 , the actual value depending on quark electric charge , fields magnitude and temperature .    because @xmath4 equilibrates it is possible to introduce the chiral chemical potential , @xmath5 , conjugated to @xmath23 at equilibrium . differently from previous calculations with chirality imbalance ,",
    "in the present study we compute the value of @xmath5 self - consistently by coupling the gap equation to the number equation , even if we limit ourselves to the approximation of small fields and small @xmath5 , namely working at the leading order in @xmath24 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath5 will depend on temperature as well as on external fields , and on the relaxation time .",
    "we focus on the effects of the external fields on the chiral phase transition , with emphasis on the role of chirality production in the critical region . because of the small fields approximation involved in the solution of the gap as well as the number equations , we are aware that our picture about thermodynamics might change in case of large fields .    in this study",
    "we compute the effect of the dynamically produced @xmath4 on @xmath15 .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath25 term tends to lower the critical temperature ; on the other hand the chiral chemical potential has the effect to increase @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compute the response of @xmath15 to the simultaneous presence of @xmath5 and fields , to check if the inverse catalysis scenario obtained at @xmath26 still persists at @xmath27 .",
    "we can anticipate our results , namely that chiral density does not affect drastically the thermodynamics at the phase transition , confirming the inverse catalysis induced by the fields , as long as the average chiral chemical potential in the crossover region turns out to be small with respect to temperature . in section v we present a detailed study of this effect , showing concrete numbers and among other things how changing the field strenghts and/or the relaxation time magnitude affects the inverse catalysis .",
    "in fact we have found and report about situations in which we can measure a net effect of the chiral chemical potential on the constituent quark mass and on critical temperature , even if we take these results with a grain of salt as the value of @xmath5 at equilibrium turns out to be of the order of the critical temperature , hence potentially validating our quantitative predictions .",
    "the relaxation time for chirality adds the greatest theoretical uncertainty to our calculations : in absence of a specific calculation of @xmath9 it is possible to give only a rough estimate based on dimensional analysis as well as on physical reasons ; we chose @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the constituent quark mass which is computed self - consistently within the model : it depends on temperature and fields , and by construction it brings informations about the chiral condensate at zero as well as finite temperature .",
    "because of this uncertainty on @xmath9 we feel it is not so important , in this explorative study , to present the most complete calculation possible taking into account the full propagators with the full @xmath5 dependence : we suspect in fact that even within the most accurate calculation possible , the new effects of the chiral density on the phase transition might be cancelled by changing @xmath9 which still would remain unknown .",
    "we therefore prefer to limit ourselves to a simple weak fields and small @xmath5 approximation to explore the effects the chiral density will have on the phase diagram , leaving a more complete calculation to a future study .    the plan of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the model we use for our calculations . in section",
    "iii we present few selected results at zero temperature which show the interplay between the electric and magnetic fields on chiral symmetry breaking . in section",
    "iv we discuss some result at finite temperature , with emphasis on the chiral phase transition without taking into account chirality production . in section",
    "v we compute chirality at equilibrium and the related chiral chemical potential , and study the effect of this chirality on the critical temperature . finally in section",
    "vi we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this article we are interested to study quark matter in a background of an electric - magnetic fluc tube made of parallel electric , @xmath0 , and magnetic , @xmath1 , fields .",
    "we assume the fields are constant in time and homogeneous in space ; moreover we assume they develop along the @xmath30direction . in this section",
    "we describe the model we use for our calculations .",
    "more specifically , we use a nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite ( see  @xcite for reviews ) with a local interaction kernel , in which we introduce the coupling of quarks with the external alectric and magnetic fields .",
    "the set up of the gap equation has been presented in great detail in  @xcite which we follow , therefore we will skip all the technical details and report here only the few equations we need to specify the interactions used in the calculations . the euclidean lagrangian density is given by @xmath31,\\ ] ] with @xmath32 being a quark field with dirac , color and flavor indices , @xmath33 is the current quark mass and @xmath34 denotes a vector of pauli matrices on flavor space .",
    "the interaction with the background fields is embedded in the covariant derivative @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the set of euclidean dirac matrices and @xmath37 is the quark electric charge matrix in flavor space . in this work we use the gauge @xmath38 .    introducing the auxiliary field @xmath39 and using a mean field approximation ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential can be written as @xmath40 where the constituent quark mass is @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 corresponds to the euclidean quantization volume .",
    "the constituent quark mass differs from @xmath33 because of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , the latter being related to a nonvanishing chiral condensate , @xmath44 .",
    "even if it would be more appropriate to discuss chiral symmetry restoration via the quark condensate , because it has its counterpart in qcd , in this article we will refer to @xmath29 for simplicity , keeping in mind that whenever we discuss about the chiral phase transition in terms of @xmath29 the decrease of the latter is related to the decreasing chiral condensate .    in this model",
    "the main task is to compute self - consistently @xmath29 at finite temperature and in presence of the external fields .",
    "this is achieved by requiring the physical value of @xmath29 minimizes the thermodynamic potential , and this in turn implies that @xmath29 satisfies the gap equation , @xmath45 , namely @xmath46 where @xmath47 corresponds to the full fermion propagator in the electric and magnetic field background .",
    "the computation of the propagator has been already given in detail in  @xcite therefore here we merely quote the final result for the gap equation , that is @xmath48 where we have introduced the functions @xmath49 with @xmath50 being the third elliptic theta function , and @xmath51 in eq .",
    "eq : gkk we have added and subtracted the zero field contribution on the right hand side which is the only one to diverge , and we have regularized it by cutting the integration at @xmath52 ; on the other hand we have not added a cutoff on the field dependent part as it is not divergent . for the parameters choice",
    "we use the standard parameter set for a proper time regularization  @xcite , namely @xmath53 mev and @xmath54 .",

    "eq : fs implies the existence of an infinite set of poles on the integration in @xmath56 in eq .",

    "following the original treatment by schwinger  @xcite these poles are moved to the complex plane by adding a small imaginary part which allows to perform the @xmath58integration in principal value ; this leads to an imaginary part of the free energy , which is a sign of the vacuum instability induced by the static electric field  @xcite and leads to particle pair creation . we will consider the effect of this vacuum instability in section  [ eq : cd ] because it can be directly connected to chiral density production in case of parallel @xmath0 and @xmath1",

    "<S> in this article we study spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking for quark matter in the background of static and homogeneous parallel electric field @xmath0 and magnetic field @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we use a nambu - jona - lasinio model with a local kernel interaction to compute the relevant quantities to describe chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature for a wide range of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effect of this background on inverse catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking for @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the same order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we then focus on the effect of equilibration of chiral density , @xmath4 , produced dynamically by axial anomaly on the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibration of @xmath4 , a consequence of chirality flipping processes in the thermal bath , allows for the introduction of the chiral chemical potential , @xmath5 , which is computed self - consistently as a function of temperature and field strength by coupling the number equation to the gap equation , and solving the two within an expansion in @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even if chirality is produced and equilibrates within a relaxation time @xmath9 , it does not change drastically the thermodynamics , with particular reference to the inverse catalysis induced by the external fields , as long as the average @xmath5 at equilibrium is not too large . </S>"
