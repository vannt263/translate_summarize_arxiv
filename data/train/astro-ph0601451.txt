    "statistical studies of supernova ( sn ) rates , based on ob star counts , pulsar birth rates , fe abundance , and the sn rate in other local group galaxies , suggest that there should be many more supernova remnants ( snrs ) in our galaxy ( @xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than are currently known ( @xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this deficit is likely the result of selection effects acting against the discovery of old , faint , large remnants , as well as young , small remnants in previous low resolution and/or poor sensitivity galactic radio surveys ( e.g.  green 1991 ) .",
    "for example , past single dish surveys with @xmath11 cm have resolutions @xmath12 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 20 cm nrao very large array ( vla ) sky survey ( nvss ) has high resolution ( @xmath13 ) but poor surface brightness sensitivity @xcite .",
    "the missing remnants are likely concentrated toward the inner galaxy where the diffuse galactic plane synchrotron emission and thermal hii regions cause the most confusion .",
    "this premise is supported by the large number of new snrs discovered in the 4th quadrant by @xcite using the molongolo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) at 35 cm with @xmath13 resolution and comparatively high sensitivity . despite the success of the most survey ,",
    "a significant shortfall compared to predictions remains  most likely due to limited dynamic range .",
    "thus , more sensitive , high resolution surveys of the inner galaxy at low radio frequencies are the key to determining whether the `` missing '' remnants exist or if our understanding of sn rates is significantly flawed . from multi - configuration vla 90 cm ( 330 mhz )",
    "observations of just 1  deg@xmath14 centered on snr g11.2 - 0.3 , brogan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) discovered three new snrs , demonstrating the power of such observations .",
    "this letter presents the discovery of 35 snrs ( including the three described above ) from a more extensive 90 cm vla survey .",
    "we have imaged the galactic plane at 90 cm from @xmath15 to @xmath16 and @xmath2 using the vla in the b , c , and d configurations between 2002 and 2004 .",
    "the vla 90 cm fwhm primary beam is @xmath17 and the mosaiced image is comprised of 14 pointings , each separated by @xmath18 .",
    "the majority of these data are new , but vla archival data are also included for regions near @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , & @xmath22 .",
    "each pointing was observed for approximately 1.2 , 1.6 , and 2.2 hours in the d , c , and b configurations , respectively , over a wide range of hour angles .",
    "the data were reduced using aips and standard wide - field , low frequency data reduction techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    in order to achieve high resolution images that are also sensitive to extended structure , we have employed the multi - scale ( ms ) cleaning algorithm in aips ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . instead of a point source clean model ,",
    "ms clean tapers the data and cleans on a variety of scales ; this process virtually eliminates artifacts due to the `` clean instability '' .",
    "three scales were used to create the 90 cm mosaic : the intrinsic resolution of the multi - configuration data of @xmath23 ( differing slightly for each pointing ) , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . after cleaning ,",
    "the individual images were convolved to a common resolution of @xmath0 , corrected for primary beam attenuation , and then linearly mosaiced .",
    "these data are not sensitive to structures @xmath26 , and thus resolve out the galactic background synchrotron emission .",
    "the final rms noise of the mosaiced image is a function of @xmath27 and is @xmath28 mjy  beam@xmath8 for @xmath29 , increasing to @xmath30 mjy  beam@xmath8 at @xmath31 .",
    "this is by far the highest dynamic range large - scale image of this part of the galactic plane yet created for @xmath32 cm .",
    "complementary images at other frequencies are required to search for non - thermal emission .",
    "for this purpose we have created a 20 cm mosaic of a large fraction of the 90 cm survey region using data from the northern extension of the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) observed with the australia telescope compact array ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* survey region includes @xmath33 ) combined with archival vla d - configuration 20 cm data ( see * ? ? ? * outside the sgps region the vla data alone were used ) .",
    "the resolution of this image is @xmath34 and the rms noise is @xmath35 mjy  beam@xmath8 .",
    "the resulting 20 cm image is not sensitive to smooth structures larger than about @xmath36 , for this reason the @xmath37 resolution single dish bonn 11 cm survey data with an rms noise of @xmath30 mjy  beam@xmath8 were also utilized @xcite .",
    "_ midcourse space experiment _ ( msx )",
    "8 @xmath3 m data @xcite with @xmath38 resolution were also used to distinguish between thermal and non - thermal emission ( non - thermal emission is anti - correlated with bright ir emission ) .",
    "the snr candidates were selected based on the following criteria :    1 .",
    "the source must be resolved in our @xmath0 90 cm image and show a shell - like ( or partial shell ) morphology 2 .",
    "the radio continuum spectral index ( @xmath39 ) computed from the integrated flux densities must be negative , indicative of non - thermal emission 3 .",
    "the source must be distinct from bright mid - ir 8 @xmath3 m emission .",
    "table  1 lists the 35 sources that meet these criteria . by way of confirmation , this list includes seven sources that have been previously identified as snr candidates that have not yet been included in green s snr catalog @xcite .",
    "the 19 previously identified snrs within the survey region are also detected and confirmed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the determination of criterion two both the 20 and 11 cm flux density estimates suffer from significant caveats",
    ". the 20 cm flux densities ( @xmath40 ) for candidates larger than about @xmath41 are likely to be lower limits ( due to missing short spacing information ) ; @xmath40 measurements for candidates larger than @xmath36 are precluded .",
    "the 11 cm flux densities suffer to varying degrees from confusion due to the comparably low resolution of this survey .",
    "the flux densities at all three wavelengths have been corrected for background emission , though this correction is least certain for the 11 cm data . for the majority of candidates , the spectral indices ( @xmath42 ) determined from the 90/20 cm data and 90/11 cm data ( last two columns of table  1 ) are in good agreement .",

    "the @xcite 20 cm integrated flux densities are typically @xmath45 times higher than those listed in table  1 because their measurements were not restricted to the candidate s spatial extent nor was background subtraction performed .",

    "the number of identified remnants within the survey boundaries ( previously 19 ) has increased by nearly a factor of 3 to 54 .",
    "based on completeness considerations and empirical evidence , respectively , @xcite and @xcite estimate that there should be between 65 to 85 snrs in this region , in reasonable agreement with the observed number , given that we are insensitive to the smallest ( @xmath52 ) and largest ( @xmath53 ) size scale remnants , as well as crab like remnants lacking radio shells .",
    "to estimate the implications of these new snr discoveries on the total number of galactic snrs we assume ( 1 ) the current snr catalog @xcite is essentially complete for @xmath54 and for @xmath55 ; ( 2 ) that the bonn 11 cm survey in the 1st quadrant and the most 35 cm survey in the 4th quadrant have similar levels of completeness ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( 3 ) the number of known snrs between @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( 115 ) should be scaled by a factor of three ( i.e.  the increase achieved in our limited survey ) .",
    "the @xmath58 cutoff is guided by the longitude extent of the inner galactic disk .",
    "these assumptions result in a prediction of 460 for the number of galactic snrs , still a factor of two less than the expected @xmath59 snrs ( see  1 ) .    however , five of the new snrs are in close proximity to ( or coincident with ) the two largest previously known snrs in the survey region : w28 and w30 ( figs .",
    "1a , b ) , but appear distinct from them .",
    "although we do not currently know if the new snrs are physically close to the two known snrs ( along the line of sight ) , such a result would be unsurprising since high mass stars form in clustered environments . a new snr has also been proposed to lie along the line of sight to the vela snr ( i.e.  g266.21.2 * ? ? ?",
    "such superpositions throughout the plane may also explain some fraction of the `` missing '' remnants .",
    "the assumption of completeness for @xmath55 is also probably flawed as a few snrs continue to be discovered in the outer galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "overall , these results suggest that the `` missing snrs '' problem can be attributed to selection effects and not our understanding of sn rates .",
    "future instruments like the evla , lwa , ata , and ska will allow even deeper low frequency , high dynamic range surveys which will likely discover the remaining shortfall of galactic snrs .",
