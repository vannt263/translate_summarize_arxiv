    "the neumann model is an interesting example of integrable model , both classically and quantum mechanically , which describes the motion of a point on a sphere subject to a harmonic potential . in the quantum case",
    "a lot of effort has been devoted to study the semi  classical approximation  @xcite , since it deals with algebro  geometric objects which appear naturally in the classical theory .",
    "however this study becomes more interesting and concrete when one has precise numbers to state effectively the bohr - sommerfeld conditions and compare them with exact spectra . in a previous works",
    "@xcite , we showed how to solve numerically the separated schrdinger equation to obtain numerical values of the energy and compared this to a semiclassical computation valid for a large radius of the sphere .",
    "this case corresponds to the localization of the particle around the antipodal minima of the potential .",
    "these localized states come in pairs which are split by the tunneling probability between the two poles .",
    "the two states are either symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange of the poles .",
    "when the sphere radius shrinks , the states become delocalized and the degeneracy is lifted by a finite quantity . in the limit of zero radius ,",
    "the potential becomes irrelevant and the energy is the one of the free particle on the sphere @xmath0 .",
    "the symmetric and antisymmetric solutions go to states with @xmath1 differing by one .",
    "when flowing between the large radius and small radius cases , the matching conditions used in the wkb analysis must change , in particular to explain this degeneracy lifting .",
    "we study in this work the evolution of the matching phase which either goes from @xmath2 to 0 through @xmath3 for a symmetric wave function of from @xmath2 to @xmath4 through @xmath5 for an antisymmetric wave function .    in a first part , we study the zero radius limiting case , where the energy is reproduced by the wkb method up to a small constant",
    ". then we detail the numerical evolution of the phase . in a last part",
    ", we explain this evolution through the asymptotic analysis of a simplified model .",
    "even if the neumann model has been generalized to arbitrary dimensions , there are no really new phenomena appearing above the three dimensions to which we limit ourselves in this work .",
    "the parameters of the neumann model are the oscillator strengths which can be reduced without loss of generality to be 0 , 1 and @xmath6 .",
    "the schrdinger equation separates using the neumann coordinates , yielding the one - dimensional equation : @xmath7 in this equation , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the eigenvalues of the conserved quantities which have to be determined and @xmath10 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radius of the sphere .",
    "the energy is @xmath13 . in the sequel",
    ", we take @xmath14 .",
    "the points 0 , 1 and @xmath6 are regular singularities of eq .",
    "( [ wangerin ] ) with exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 , corresponding to solutions with monodromies @xmath17 . in order to recover a well defined solution on the sphere with definite parity properties under the three possible reflexions ,",
    "the solution must have definite monodromies at the three singularities  @xcite .",
    "an even solution is thus a solution with monodromy 1 at 0 , 1 and  @xmath6 , that is a function which is analytic on the whole complex plane .",
    "if we want an odd solution under @xmath18 , we factor @xmath19 in @xmath20 and search for an analytic solution to the equation : @xmath21 similar equations can be written for the six other possible combinations of parities .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we showed how the semiclassical analysis nicely fits the exact numerical spectra of the neumann model in the large @xmath10 limit , when the point is confined around the poles . to extend the analysis to the whole range of values for @xmath10",
    ", we first consider the @xmath22 case , corresponding to the spheroidal harmonics .",
    "the energy is known exactly in this case , since it is simply the energy of a free particle on the sphere , @xmath23 .    in this case ,",
    "the potential simplifies since the numerator is of degree one : @xmath24 the bohr ",
    "sommerfeld integrals are thus elliptic integrals , with the four special points 0 , 1 , @xmath25 and @xmath6 corresponding to the vertices of the period rectangle , and a pole at infinity .",
    "we have two cases to study according to the position of @xmath25 with respect to 1 .",
    "the quantification conditions , in the case with all monodromies equal to 1 , are either ones of : @xmath26 these quantification conditions involve the usual @xmath2 phase factor coming from the asymptotics of the airy function around the turning point @xmath25 , see e.g.  @xcite .    adding the two bohr  sommerfeld integrals , one gets a condition which does not depend on the position of @xmath25 with respect to 1 .",
    "in fact , this sum can be computed and does not depend on @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , the integrand is an abelian integral of the third type with simple poles at the two points over @xmath27 .",
    "the real part of the integral on the real axis is just the sum we want to evaluate , since the integrand is purely imaginary on the complementary segments .",
    "hence the residue theorem allows to calculate this sum .",
    "the residue is @xmath28 and since the integration contour runs through the pole , we get a contribution of @xmath29 times the residue .",
    "the final quantification condition is therefore : @xmath30 the semiclassical energy thus depends only on the total number of excitations and not on the individual values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the angular momentum is @xmath33 so that @xmath34 .",
    "this differs by merely @xmath35 from the exact result and is exactly the value of @xmath36 which must be used in a semiclassical treatment of spherically symmetric potential according to langer  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath25 varies , we should be able to pass smoothly from the case of eq .",
    "( [ qan1 ] ) to the one of eq .",
    "( [ qan2 ] ) .",
    "the additional phases therefore go from @xmath15 to @xmath2 and from @xmath2 to 0 , but their sum should remain constant for the semiclassical energy to be completely independent of @xmath25 . in particular ,",
