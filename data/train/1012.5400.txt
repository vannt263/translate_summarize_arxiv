    "leptons are of particulary interest in high energy hadronic collisions because they provide clean event signatures in a complex hadronic environment .",
    "electrons and muons are often considered because of such detector signatures .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 leptons ( called simply @xmath0 here after ) brings a potential acceptance gain of @xmath3 @xmath4 according to the lepton multiplicity of the analyzed final state .",
    "moreover , studies with @xmath0 leptons provide an interesting area to test the consistency of the standard model ( sm ) through lepton universality at high energies by measuring the branching ratio of electroweak ( ew ) bosons decaying into @xmath0 leptons  @xcite .",
    "one promising candidate for extension to the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) which predicts new particles that can decay into @xmath0 leptons .",
    "the existence of such scenario can be probed within @xmath0 final states  @xcite .",
    "finally , many decay chains initiated by the higgs boson involve @xmath0 leptons and considering them can then increase the experimental sensitivity to understand the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb )  @xcite .",
    "considering @xmath0 leptons thus appears to encompass many virtues .",
    "however , understanding such an object in a hadronic environment is very challenging .",
    "the neutrino(s ) from @xmath0 final states escape the detector without interacting and forces a fraction of the @xmath0 energy to be invisible .",
    "hence , the resulting visible energy is relatively soft and includes contamination from soft qcd interactions , which becomes a primary component of the hadronic final state .",
    "further , the various decay mode of @xmath0 must be considered . on the one hand",
    ", the identification of @xmath0 from its leptonic decay ( @xmath5 ) suffers from electrons and muons originating from direct ew bosons decay as well as a poor statistic due to @xmath6 . on the other hand , @xmath0 identification from its",
    "hadronic decays ( @xmath7 ) have different detector signature according to the hadronic resonance involved .",
    "moreover , direct qcd interactions from hadrons collisions produce a lot of hadronic final states which can mimic the hadronically decaying @xmath0 . to be optimal ,",
    "each of the different hadronic @xmath0 final states requires dedicated analysis and a combination is performed to extract the full information .",
    "the complexity of hadronic @xmath0 final states require sophisticated algorithms based on multivariate technics applied after event reconstruction .",
    "the next section describes the @xmath0 reconstruction at the d experiment .",
    "the subsequent section discusses multivariate analysis ( mva ) discriminant , which allows separation of @xmath0 from jet fakes .",
    "in this section , we describe how the @xmath0 candidate is built from elementary reconstructed objects within the calorimeter and tracking systems  @xcite .",
    "three objects are potentially used to build reconstructed @xmath0 object :    1 .",
    "calorimeter cluster found by a simple cone algorithm in a @xmath8 cone .",
    "electromagnetic subcluster found using a nearest neighbour algorithm with a seed in the third layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter ( i.e. the layer containing the finest segmentation ) .",
    "the clustered energy is required be greater than @xmath9  mev .",
    "all the tracks found by the d tracking algorithm in a @xmath10 cone around the calorimeter cluster are considered .",
    "an invariant mass requirement is applied to keep only tracks compatible with the @xmath0 decay .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the use of these objects to optimize the @xmath0 reconstruction according to its hadronic decay .",
    "the d experiment bases its @xmath0 lepton reconstruction on specific signatures of the hadronic system present in the @xmath0 final state .",
    "three types of candidate are defined and depends on the reconstructed objects signature .",
    "there are categorized as :    * type @xmath11 : one calorimeter cluster and one track ( optimized for @xmath12 decay ) ; * type @xmath13 : one calorimeter cluster , one track and one calorimeter em subcluster ( optimized for @xmath14 decay ) ; * type @xmath15 : one calorimeter cluster , at least two tracks ( optimized for @xmath15-prong @xmath16 decay ) .",
    "figure [ fig : recoeff ] shows the reconstruction algorithm for type @xmath13 @xmath0 .",
    "one can see that almost all real @xmath0 above @xmath17  gev are selected by the d reconstruction but a large fraction of jets ( or fake @xmath0 ) remains .",
    "indeed , jets from direct strong interaction can easily mimic hadronically decaying @xmath0 lepton and therefore , sophisticated methods is needed to separate @xmath0 from jets .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "hadronic final states of @xmath0 leptons can be faked by jets arising from direct qcd interactions .",
    "however , jets signatures from @xmath0 are narrower and have lower tracks multiplicity .",
    "these properties can be used to reject qcd jets and thereby increase the @xmath0 identification efficiency .",
    "in fact , other specificities of hadronic @xmath0 decays can also be exploited and the full information can be combined in a neural network ( nn )  @xcite . in particular , a total of @xmath18 observables ( depending on the @xmath0 type ) are considered based on a)the isolation in the tracking system as well as in the calorimeter b)shower shape and composition c)correlations between the tracking system and the calorimeter .",
    "figure [ fig : varnn ] provides an example of two such nn input variables .    the nn output peaks at @xmath19 for the qcd jets and at @xmath11 for the @xmath0 jets as shown in figure [ fig : nnoutput ] .",
    "the @xmath20 electroweak process is clearly sizeable and data ( black dots ) are well understood by the sm prediction ( filled histograms ) .      although @xmath0 reconstruction algorithm is efficient , the signal over background ratio @xmath21 is poor .",
    "in fact , the order of magnitude of @xmath22 is @xmath13 at the reconstruction level and reaches almost @xmath23 after the nn selection .",
    "table [ table:1 ] summarizes efficiencies for each @xmath0 types after reconstruction and subsequent nn identification .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +      the optimization strategy",
    "is based on how the nn treats the information provided by the physics . by denoting @xmath24 as a point in the discriminating variables space",
    ", the nn output @xmath25 converges to the true likelihood function ( which is the best classifying function ) : @xmath26    here , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the probability density function of the genuine @xmath0 ( signal ) and qcd jets ( background ) respectively in the discriminating observables space .",
    "one can find two strategies to optimize the separation between jets and @xmath0 .",
    "a first approach is to improve @xmath29 by adding more observables based on physical properties of @xmath0 leptons .",
    "a separate method would be to minimize @xmath30 by performing the nn training in specific phase space regions or by increasing the statistics of the training samples to describe the differences in more details .    in practice ,",
    "the first approach was tested by trying to include information from the d preshower system  @xcite which has a better segmentation than the calorimeter and allows an improved separation of the @xmath31 from the @xmath32 ( for type @xmath13 decay ) .",
    "after several studies , it has been shown that this approach does not significantly help to separate @xmath0 from qcd jets .",
    "new physical information can be used such as the long lifetime of the @xmath0 lepton which can lead to displaced tracks from the primary vertex similar to the case of b - jets .",
    "figure [ fig : nnbtagvar ] shows a new discriminating variable based on the impact parameter of each track for type @xmath15 @xmath0 candidates .",
    "this new observable increases the @xmath0 identification efficiency of about @xmath33 for the same jet rejection .",
    "a second approach consisting in helping the nn convergence was applied by using larger training samples and tuning specific nn parameters such as the numbers of nodes , epochs and minimization algorithm  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the difference between @xmath0 and qcd jets can evolve with the candidate transverse energy . in order to help the nn to exploit this behaviour ,",
    "dedicated trainings were done for events with high ( @xmath34  gev ) and low ( @xmath35  gev ) @xmath36 @xmath0 candidate .",
    "overall , the @xmath0/jet discrimination is improved by @xmath37 at low @xmath36 and @xmath38 at high @xmath36 as shown in figure [ fig : nnptdep ] .",
    "in order to perform physical measurements in @xmath0 lepton final states , the identification of @xmath0 leptons is necessary but not sufficient .",
    "one needs to have a good understanding of @xmath0 kinematic properties .",
    "this section deals with the @xmath0 energy measurement at the d experiment .      the object energy calibration at collider experiments is usually performed with the help of well known physical processes . at high energies ,",
    "the production and decay of @xmath39 bosons allow to perform such calibrations .",
    "two important challenges arise for the hadronically decaying @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , the @xmath20 visible mass events is defined by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the transverse missing energy .",
    "] peak is broad and shifted by the neutrinos present in the @xmath0 decay which makes this observable less sensitive than for the @xmath42 decay .",
    "secondly , the various @xmath0 decay modes implie lower statistics compared with the @xmath42 decay ( @xmath43 events versus @xmath44 events ) .",
    "these situations require to find another strategy to calibrate the visible energy of hadronic @xmath0 lepton .",
    "if one considers a type @xmath13 candidate having visible energy from @xmath45 , the true energy can be obtained from the measured energy using the hadronic calorimeter response ( @xmath46 ) and the electromagnetic calorimeter response @xmath47 : @xmath48    however , the d calorimeter is not compensated ( @xmath49 ) and its segmentation does not allow to separate the @xmath32 shower from the @xmath50 one .",
    "thus , the only measurable energy is @xmath51 . in order to deal with these experimental constraints",
    ", one must use the track energy as reference and propagate it to the calorimeter in two ways : the absolute correction and the relative correction .",
    "both methods are described below .",
    "the idea of the absolute correction is to use the tracker to measure the @xmath32 energy . in order to avoid double counting ,",
    "the average of the energy deposited by charged pion in the calorimeter is subtracted : @xmath52    figure  [ fig : energycorrabs ] shows that method brings a better measurement of the @xmath0 visible energy .",
    "another strategy to propagate the track energy is to correct the simulation event - by - event using the @xmath53(@xmath54 ) distribution for @xmath20 events selected in data : @xmath55 here , @xmath56 is the average value over the events .",
    "such a method is relative due to the fact that the simulation is adjusted to the data but the true energy is not known either in the data or in the simulation .",
    "however , the @xmath46 measurement is not needed for this approach .",
    "in high energy hadronic collisions , @xmath0 leptons require more sophisticated tools than electrons and muons because of their various hadronic decay modes and the escaping neutrino .",
    "such @xmath0 objects are of particular interest to probe the standard model as well as physics beyond the sm including many areas such as the electroweak symmetry breaking origin or supersymmetric scenarios . in spite of the various experimental challenges ,",
    "the d experiment has developed an effective algorithm to identify hadronically decaying @xmath0 leptons and has performed several physics measurements and searches employing such technics .",
    "in addition , some recent progress has been achieved on the @xmath0 identification improving the potential sensitivity of the experiment with @xmath0 leptons .",
