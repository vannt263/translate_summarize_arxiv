    "massive stars comprise a small fraction of the total number of stars in the universe , and are short - lived . however , they provide a dominant portion of the mechanical and radiative energy of galaxies .",
    "massive stars can enrich the universe with metals , trigger star formation , and are a potential source for the reionization of the universe .",
    "the evolution of massive stars is central to their ability to influence their surroundings .",
    "therefore , a better understanding of the phases of massive stellar evolution will help us comprehend many physical processes that take place within galaxies .    in massive stars ,",
    "the b[e ] phenomenon is an evolutionary phase whose origin remains unclear .",
    "stars exhibiting the b[e ] phenomenon show numerous emission lines , and normally show infrared radiation from dust .",
    "these properties point to the presence of large amounts of circumstellar material , most likely in a disk configuration .",
    "the b[e ] phenomenon is perplexing because stars in many different stages of evolution can exhibit its signs .",
    "@xcite divided the types of stars showing the b[e ] phenomenon into five groups : post - main sequence b[e ] supergiants ( sgb[e ] stars ) , pre - main sequence herbig b[e ] stars , compact planetary nebulae , symbiotic b[e ] stars , and an entire category of unclassified b[e ] stars . a link between strong infrared excess and b stars showing",
    "forbidden and permitted emission lines was identified by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite then suggested that `` b - type stars which show forbidden emission lines '' should be classified as b[e ] stars .",
    "since then , many more b[e ] stars have been found , leading to a standard definition of the b[e ] phenomenon as follows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : strong balmer emission lines ; low - excitation permitted and forbidden emission lines from low - ionization metals such as fe ; and a strong excess in the near or mid - infrared due to circumstellar dust . among the more homogeneous and well studied group of stars showing the b[e ] phenomenon are the b[e ] supergiants .",
    "supergiant b[e ] stars ( sgb[e ] ) also have well defined criteria laid out by @xcite , including supergiant luminosity ( @xmath3 4 ) , indicators of evolution off the main sequence sequence , broad ultraviolet ( uv ) absorption lines , and signs of nitrogen abundance enhancement . in order to explain the emission properties of sgb[e ] stars , @xcite proposed a two - component wind model where the star is rotating near break - up velocity and simultaneously close to the eddington limit .",
    "this causes the star to emit a wind that is fast and sparse near the poles , producing the high excitation absorption , while being denser around the equator , producing the emission features .",
    "the two - component wind allows for the creation of a dusty circumstellar disk , which produces the infrared excess seen around sgb[e ] stars . in this scenario ,",
    "the star begins exhibiting the b[e ] phenomenon sometime after the red supergiant phase , but before he - core burning begins @xcite .",
    "some sgb[e ] stars exhibit properties akin to those of luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) suggesting that lbvs and at least some sgb[e ] stars are related , although their relation remains unclear , as summarized by @xcite .",
    "r4 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is a prominent candidate for this model .",
    "r4 is currently classified as a lbv / sgb[e ] because it shows properties of both objects .",

    "it is unknown whether this is a common origin for sgb[e ] stars in general , or whether r4 is a unique case .",

    "these lines are primarily permitted and forbidden low - ionization lines from metals , such as fe ii , [ fe ii ] , ti ii , cr ii , and v ii .",
    "we identified emission lines in the spectral range 4000  4750  , based on the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "four to twelve forbidden emission lines are confirmed in each of the three new stars at these wavelengths , including [ fe ii ] @xmath124288 , 4360 , 4414 , and [ ni ii ] @xmath134462 , which are detected in all objects .",
    "we list the heliocentric radial velocities ( rv ) in table  [ t : optical ] , together with the root - mean - square velocity residual @xmath14 measured for the fitted rv from both permitted and forbidden lines , as well as that measured from only the forbidden lines , @xmath15 .",
    "given that there are fewer forbidden lines , the values of @xmath16 are fully consistent those of @xmath14 .",
    "the absorption lines of b - star spectra are also present , for example , he i , si ii , and mg ii . the classification criteria of @xcite , and @xcite were used for spectral typing of our stars ( table  [ t : optical ] ) .",
    "the presence in absorption of si ii @xmath124128 - 30 , and the relative strength of mg ii @xmath134481 compared to he i @xmath134471 indicate the spectral types of all three of our newly discovered sgb[e ] stars to be in the mid to late b range .",
    "these spectral types are unexpectedly cooler than those derived for normal ob stars in the riots4 survey .",
    "while it is possible that a cooler binary companion dominates the optical spectra , it turns out that higher @xmath17-band fluxes caused by the strong h@xmath18 emission in the decretion disks actually lead to lower @xmath19 values , mimicking a bluer continuum .",

    "two of our stars ( r15 and r38 ) show single - peaked balmer emission lines .",

    "stars form a clearly distinct group of massive stars .",

    "the ir photometry for our objects is given in table  [ irphotometry ] and plotted in figures  [ f : nearir ] and [ f : midir ] relative to these other groups of smc b stars .",
    "the figures also show the previously known sgb[e ] stars in the smc and lmc @xcite , which show a large ir excess , whereas our stars are on average 0.6 mag bluer than azv 154 in @xmath35-@xmath36 , 0.3 mag bluer in @xmath37-@xmath36 , and 2.4 mag bluer in @xmath37-[3.6 ] .",
    "the modest ir excess for our stars , r15 , r38 , and r48 , is similar to that for classical be stars .",
    "in contrast , b stars that do not show evidence of a circumstellar disk have ir colors around zero , with the exception of some outliers which are just evolving off the main sequence",

    "interestingly , the infrared properties of our three stars closely match the infrared properties of classical be stars .",

    "* ) , width=321,height=302 ]      through the infrared data obtained from the 2mass and sage smc surveys , we see that our stars show an infrared excess that is distinctly lower than that of previously discovered sgb[e ] stars .",
    "this suggests a lack of warm dust in the circumstellar material around our three stars .",
    "an excess in @xmath38[24 ] @xmath2 5 indicates the presence of an optically thick , dusty disk @xcite .",
    "our stars fall well below that limit , around @xmath38[24 ] = 2.8 , indicating that a dusty circumstellar disk is lacking , but indicating the presence of an optically thin circumstellar disk , which is characterized by @xmath38[24 ] @xmath2 0.3 .",
    "the modest infrared excess of our stars is similar to that of classical be stars ( figures [ f : nearir ] and [ f : midir ] ) , and their ir seds are also similar ( figure  [ f : irsed ] ) . figure  [ f : irsed ] shows that r15 , r38 , and r48 lack the ir bump from hot dust emission typical of sgb[e ] stars like azv  154 .",
    "while , being supergiants , our stars are much brighter , the general shape of the seds of our stars more closely follows that of classical be stars .",
    "thus , the ir emission in our objects may not be due to dust emission as is typical of sgb[e ] stars , but may instead result from free - free emission as in classical be stars @xcite . in the ir , free - free opacity increases at longer wavelengths , leading to an inverse power - law sed @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite obtained ir spectra of several sgb[e ] stars and found evidence of free - free emission in the near ir .",
    "thus our stars appear to have optically thin circumstellar disks , since they show weak ir excesses .",
    "the lack of circumstellar dust could be due to a couple different factors .",
    "first , the circumstellar disks around our stars could be ultra metal - poor .",
    "the smc is already known to be a metal - poor environment , and the normal sgb[e ] stars in the smc show a lower infrared excess on average than those in either the lmc or the galaxy .",
    "alternatively , our sgb[e ] stars simply could have much smaller , or less massive , circumstellar disks , possibly because they are just transitioning into or out of the sgb[e ] phase .",
    "if there is a lack of material in the disks around our stars , then the disks would be optically thin , meaning that dust would not be able to form , and the only infrared excess would be due to free - free emission . if our stars have such low - mass circumstellar disks , this would manifest in the optical spectra through the presence of weak emission lines , as opposed to the very strong emission lines seen in other sgb[e ] stars ; this is exactly what is seen in our spectra .",
    "we have referred to r15 , r38 , and r48 , as sgb[e ] stars in this work . however , as described earlier , the current definition of b[e ] stars includes a `` strong '' infrared excess ( e.g. , conti 1997 ; zickgraf 1998 ) .",
    "this has been straightforward , since the optical spectral properties and infrared emission have always appeared to occur together .",
    "now , however , our discovery of several objects having optical b[e ] spectra , while lacking the strong ir excess , presents a complication for classification . while @xcite specifies the criteria for b[e ] stars to include the strong ir excess , he also states that the spectroscopic criteria were defined for the optical spectrum . on the advice of peter conti and henny lamers",
    ", we classify these ir - weak objects as b[e ] stars , based on the original , optically - based definition of the stars ( p. conti ; h. j. g. l. m. lamers , private communications ) .",
    "our classification therefore reverts to a definition of b[e ] stars based exclusively on the existence of b star properties together with optical permitted and forbidden emission lines @xcite .",
    "this is reinforced by the fact that the b[e ] nomenclature references only the optical spectral features .",
    "our three objects have optical and infrared properties that are quantitatively more similar to each other than to other sgb[e ] stars . and",
    ", this is not the first detection of objects showing all of the properties of sgb[e ] stars , but lacking the characteristic dusty infrared excess .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the detection of a similar object in 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "this object , vfts 698 , shows optical [ fe ii ] emission and ir properties similar to the three stars that we have found , and to classical be stars .",
    "as also found in our stars , the photospheric emission is visible in vfts 698 , as seen in the the absorption - line spectrum of he i and si ii ; whereas the photosphere is only occasionaly seen in sgb[e ] stars .",
    "we include the data for this star in table  [ irphotometry ] and figures  [ f : nearir ]  [ f : irsed ] .",
    "there are likely to be a number of other such known stars , for example , mwc 314 in the milky way @xcite .",
    "we caution that both vfts 698 and mwc 314 are known binaries , which may complicate the comparison with our newly found smc objects .",
    "however , one of our objects , r48 , shows an anomalously high radial velocity ( table  [ t : optical ] ) which may be evidence of binarity .",
    "thus , dust - poor sgb[e ] stars are found in widely different environments : vfts698 in 30 doradus , our three stars in the field of the smc , and mwc 314 in the milky way .",
    "we therefore propose that such stars may be a distinct subset of sgb[e ] stars , which may be transitioning to or from the full - fledged b[e ] phenomenon .",
    "we report spectroscopic observations of three new sgb[e ] stars , along with similar observations of azv 154 , a previously known sgb[e ] star .",
    "these stars were observed in the course of the riots4 survey of massive field stars in the smc .",
    "our stars show rich emission - line spectra , including emission in the balmer lines , and forbidden and permitted emission from low - excitation metals typical of the b[e ] phenomenon .",
    "the stars have supergiant luminosities . based on observations of our stars in h@xmath18 , [ sii ] , and [ oiii ] ,",
    "they are apparently not associated with star - forming regions , implying that they are unlikely to be herbig b[e ] stars .",
    "the presence of p cygni profiles in one of the spectra , the comparison to azv 154 , and the position of our stars on the h - r diagram are also consistent with the properties of sgb[e ] stars .",
    "most interestingly , our stars do not show the strong ir excess characteristic of other sgb[e ] stars .",
    "instead , the ir emission from our stars resembles that of classical be stars , suggesting that it originates from free - free emission .",
    "thus , our stars lack the strong circumstellar dust disks that produce the ir excess in b[e ] stars",
    ". this could be due to low dust content in the disks , or it could be due to the disks being much lower mass .",
    "the existence of other dust - poor sgb[e ] stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
