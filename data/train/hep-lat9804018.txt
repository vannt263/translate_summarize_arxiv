    "linked cluster expansions ( lces ) have a long tradition in statistical physics . originally applied to classical fluids , later to magnetic systems ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and references therein ) , they were generalized to applications in particle physics in the eighties @xcite . there",
    "they have been used to study the continuum limit of a lattice @xmath0 field theory in 4 dimensions at zero temperature . in @xcite",
    "they were further generalized to field theories at finite temperature , simultaneously the highest order in the expansion parameter was increased to 18 . usually the analytic expansions are obtained as graphical expansions . because of the progress in computer facilities and the development of efficient algorithms for generating the graphs , it is nowadays possible to handle of the order of billions of graphs .",
    "the whole range from high temperatures down to the critical region becomes available , and thermodynamic quantities like critical indices and critical temperatures are determined with high precision ( the precision is comparable or even better than in corresponding high quality monte carlo results ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an extension of lces to a finite volume in combination with a high order in the expansion parameter turned out to be a particularly powerful tool for investigating the phase structure of systems with first and second order transitions by means of a finite size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "linked cluster expansions are series expansions of the free energy and connected correlation functions about an ultralocal , decoupled theory in terms of a hopping parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding graphical representation is a sum in terms of connected graphs .",
    "the value of @xmath1 parametrizes the strength of interactions between fields at different lattice sites .",
    "usually they are chosen as nearest neighbours , but also more general , less local couplings lead to convergent expansions ( @xcite and references therein ) under appropriate conditions on the decay of the interactions .",
    "in contrast to the ultralocal terms of a generic interaction we will sometimes refer to hopping terms as non - ultralocal .    in this paper we develop dynamical linked cluster expansions ( dlces ) . these are linked cluster expansions with hopping parameter terms that are endowed with their own dynamics .",
    "such systems are realized in spin glasses or partially annealed neural networks with ( fast ) spins and ( slow ) interactions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they also occur in variational estimates for su(n)-gauge - higgs systems as we will show later in this paper . like lces",
    "they are expected to converge for a large class of interactions .",
    "formally dlces amount to a generalization of an expansion scheme from 2-point to point - link - point - interactions .",
    "these are interactions between fields associated with two points and with one pair of points called link .",
    "the points and links are not necessarily embedded on a lattice , and the links need not be restricted to nearest neighbours .",
    "we develop a new theory in which a generalized notion of connectivity plays a central role .",
    "standard notions of equivalence classes of graphs like 1-line irreducible and 1-vertex irreducible graphs have to be generalized , and new notions like 1-multiple - line irreducible graphs must be defined in order to give a systematic classification .",
    "we describe algorithms for generating these classes .",
    "this is essential , since the number of graphs rapidly increases with the order in the expansion parameter .",
    "it typically exceeds the number of lce - graphs by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we specify the models that admit a dlce .",
    "we introduce and explain the idea behind the abstract notions of theory .",
    "detailed definitions of , related notions and the computation of weights are given in section 3 .",
    "section 4 treats the issue of renormalization in the sense of suitable resummations of graphs .",
    "algorithms for their generation are described in section 5 .",
    "applications to spin glasses and ( partially annealed ) neural networks are indicated in section 6 .",
    "there it is of particular interest that dlces allow for the possibility of avoiding the replica trick . in section 7",
    "we present results for the transition line of an su(2 ) higgs model .",
    "these are obtained by dlces applied to gap equations that follow from convexity estimates of the free energy density .",
    "the results are in good agreement with corresponding high precision monte carlo results @xcite .",
    "section 8 contains a summary and outlook .",
    "the reader who is more interested in our actual applications of dlces may skip sections 3 - 5 in a first reading .",
    "these sections are of interest from a systematic point of view and essential if he is interested in applying dlces .",
    "in this section we first specify the class of models for which we develop dynamical linked cluster expansions .",
    "next we illustrate some basic notions of multiple - line graph theory , in particular the need for a new notion of connectivity .",
    "by @xmath2 we denote a finite or infinite set of points .",
    "one of its realizations is a hypercubic lattice in @xmath3 dimensions , infinite or finite in some directions with the topology of a torus .",
