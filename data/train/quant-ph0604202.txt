    "from a mathematical point of view , quantum information theory deals with finite dimensional hilbert spaces , the state spaces of finite @xmath0-partite systems , which have the special form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the finite dimensional state space of the @xmath3th part ( or particle ) of the system , most of the time assumed to be a _ qubit _ , which means that @xmath4 .",
    "the interesting non - classical behaviors on which the theory is based already occur for two - qubit systems , for the so - called _ entangled states _ , those @xmath5 which can not be written in the form @xmath6 .",
    "the properties of such states are the basis of the epr paradox @xcite , and since its discovery , the entanglement phenomenon has been thoroughly investigated by physicists , cf .",
    "@xcite , and more recently by mathematicians , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "there is , however , no general agreement on the definition of entanglement for systems with more than two parts .",
    "klyachko has proposed @xcite to regard as entangled the states which are _ semi - stable _ for the action of the group of invertible local filtering operations , also called slocc , @xmath7 in the sense of geometric invariant theory , which means those states on which at least one non trivial @xmath8-invariant polynomial does not vanish .",
    "the point of introducing _ geometric _ invariant theory is that this theory provides methods for characterizing such states without explicitly computing the invariants . in order to explore the significance of this property",
    ", the invariants have been explicited in the simplest cases ( up to 4 qubits , and 3 qutrits , with partial results for 5 qubits , @xcite ) .",
    "one would also like to _ quantify _ entanglement .",
    "the non - locality properties of an entangled state does not change under unitary operations acting independently on each of its sub - systems .",
    "the idea of describing entanglement by means of local unitary invariants is explored in @xcite , see also @xcite . however , except for the simplest systems , there are far too many orbits and a complete classification is out of reach .    an intermediate possibility is to look at the @xmath8-orbits .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath8-invariant polynomials is not sufficient to separate the @xmath8-orbits , and in general , one has to look for the _ covariants _ in the sense of classical invariant theory .    in @xcite , the algebra of @xmath8-covariants for @xmath9 qubits has been investigated , and a complete set of generators has been obtained .    in the present article , we will explain how these results can be applied to the calculation of bases of unitary invariants . as an application ,",
    "we compute bases of the spaces of local unitary and special unitary invariants of degree @xmath9 of @xmath0 qubits for arbitrary @xmath0 , and recover the results of @xcite for 3 and 4 qubits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ slocctolut ]",
    "we recall some background on slocc covariants , and we describe a method allowing to obtain from them local unitary ( lut ) and special unitary ( lsut ) invariants . section [ simplest ] is devoted to the computation of the simplest lut and lsut invariants from slocc covariants .",
    "finally , we give some examples and applications in section [ examples ] .",
    "let @xmath10 be the local hilbert space of a two - state system ( a qubit ) , and @xmath11 be the state space of a system of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "we shall regard it as the natural representation of the group @xmath12 , known in quantum information theory as the group of reversible local filtering operations , or stochastic local quantum operations assisted by classical communication ( slocc ) @xcite .",

    "the action of a @xmath0-tuple of matrices @xmath24 on the various vector spaces introduced so far is defined by @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the components @xmath27 of @xmath28 are defined by the condition @xmath29    in the following , we shall be interested in lut and lsut invariants of a state @xmath30 , i.e. polynomial functions @xmath31 in the components of @xmath30 , such that @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the components of @xmath28 for @xmath34 a lut or a lsut .",
    "our main point will be the application of the slocc invariant theory to the calculation of such unitary invariants .",
    "the slocc invariants are the holomorphic polynomials @xmath35 such that @xmath36 for @xmath37 . of course , the squared modulus @xmath38 of a slocc invariant is a lsut invariant , but only a small subset of unitary invariant are of this form",
    ".    the methods of classical invariant theory can be applied to the determination of the slocc invariants of @xmath0 qubits for small @xmath0 .",

    "a covariant @xmath44 of @xmath45 is a multi- homogeneous @xmath46-invariant polynomial in the form coefficients @xmath47 and in the original variables @xmath48 , that is , an invariant in some space @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the multidegree of @xmath44 in the @xmath48 .",
    "clearly , a covariant can be interpreted as an equivariant map @xmath51 from the irreducible representation @xmath52 of @xmath8 to @xmath53 .",

    "we denote by @xmath56 the corresponding graded pieces .",
    "the knowledge of their dimensions @xmath57 is equivalent to the decomposition of the character of @xmath53 into irreducible characters of @xmath8 , and the knowledge of a basis of @xmath56 allows one to write down a clebsch - gordan series with respect to @xmath8 for any polynomial in @xmath58 .",
    "also , it is known that the equations of any @xmath8-invariant closed subvariety of the projective space @xmath59 are given by the simultaneous vanishing of the coefficients of some covariants .",
    "a modern introduction to classical invariant theory can be found in the book @xcite .",
    "a generating set of the algebra of the polynomial covariants for the action of the slocc group can be in principle computed by a slight adaptation of the classical method ( the cayley omega process , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    ". nevertheless it may be always possible to compute the smallest covariants with relevant geometric properties .",
    "as already mentioned , a basis @xmath64 of the space of the polynomial slocc - covariants can be identified with a basis of highest weight vectors in the symmetric algebra @xmath65 , so that one can write @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the irreducible representation of @xmath8 whose highest weight vector corresponds to the covariant @xmath68 .",

    "combining the previous abstract nonsense identifying covariants with @xmath8-highest weight vectors and @xmath8-equivariant maps , and the canonical antilinear isomorphism of a hilbert space with its hermitian dual implies the following result :    [ compluinv ] denoting by @xmath78 a basis of slocc covariants of degree @xmath40 in the entries of the tensor and multidegree @xmath50 in the auxiliary variables , one has :    1 .",
