    "observations of non - thermal astrophysical sources upon the utmost diverse spatial scales and luminosity ranges , from supernova remnants to active galactic nuclei , and energy bands , from radio frequencies up to @xmath1rays , require electron acceleration up to ultra - relativistic energies when interpreted via synchrotron or self - compton emission .",
    "relativistic particles can also be directly detected as in the case of the streams of particles from solar flares or the cosmic radiation .",
    "multi - wavelength studies of extragalactic jets , performed by combining observations from radio arrays , hst in the optical band and x - ray satellites , showed that many extragalactic jets emit non - thermal radiation extending from radio to x - rays , and that spectral and morphological features remain , in many instances , nearly constant along the jet from radio up to optical frequencies .",
    "this implies a constancy of the relativistic electron distribution function over at least five decades in energy , that needs to be interpreted ( see discussions in meisenheimer , rser & schltelburg 1996 and meisenheimer , neumann & rser 1996 for m87 )",
    ".    many physical mechanisms of particle acceleration have been studied , and fermi - like processes occurring at mhd shocks have been particularly visited since they automatically lead to power - law particle distributions , as dictated by observations ( see , e.g. , bell 1978 , drury 1983 , blandford & eichler 1987 , achterberg 1990 , kirk 1994 ) .",
    "other mechanisms of particle acceleration include the diffusive particle acceleration at a tangential discontinuity in a velocity field involving relativistic velocities ( ostrowski , 1990 , 1998 ) . continuous reacceleration of particles could take place by conversion of magnetic energy into particle energy via magnetic reconnection , as proposed by lesch & birk ( 1998 ) ; mechanisms of particle acceleration by turbulent plasma waves ( li et al .",
    "1997 ) or by intense long - wavelength electromagnetic fields ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 1995 ) have also been considered .",
    "each of these mechanisms leads to different values for the maximum energy attained by the accelerated particles , and different predictions on the observed radiation spectrum .    a possible clue to build a  universal spectrum \" is the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) by multiple shocks , as discussed in melrose & pope ( 1993 ) and ferrari & melrose ( 1997 ) , under very general conditions .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the diffusive particle acceleration at shocks , and we treat , in a consistent way by means of a numerical hydrocode , the jet instabilities that yield shock formation , the particle acceleration in these shocks , and the temporal evolution of the distribution function , subject to adiabatic effects and synchrotron losses . in our model the magnetic field and the relativistic particles are advected passively by the thermal fluid , as in previous studies by matthews and scheuer ( 1990 ) who treated adiabatic expansion and synchrotron losses without including particle acceleration , and by massaglia et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who modeled shock acceleration as an adiabatic compression of fixed strength . in our study",
    "the equation for the evolution of the particle distribution function is solved in a self - consistent way , and particle acceleration at shocks is treated in the ` test - particle ' approximation , i.e. neglecting the effects of energy subtraction from the shocks .",
    "moreover we concentrate on the stability and radiative properties of the jet beam , rather than studying the propagation of the jet s head as it is done in the quoted papers .",
    "our approach is thus also different from that of jones et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who solve a simplified version of the electron transport equation to account for shock diffusive acceleration and synchrotron aging in a time - dependent simulation of a radio lobe .    in studying the instability evolution",
    ", we adopt the so - called ` temporal ' approach ( see bodo et al .",
    "1994 ) , in which one can follow the system evolution for longer times , as opposed to the ` spatial analysis ' ( see hardee & norman 1988a , b and stone , xu & hardee 1997 ) , in which one is limited by the transit time through the grid . while the spatial approach allows for more direct comparison with observations , the temporal analysis is preferred when studying the physics of the instability evolution over long time scales , with good spatial resolution and without exceedingly large computational domains .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in the next section ( section 2 ) , we describe the physical model for the jet , the main assumptions and the integration method ; in section 3 we deal with the treatment of the evolution equation for the relativistic electrons distribution and of the shock acceleration ; the simulations results are discussed in sections 4 and 5 where a comparison between our model and observational data of extragalactic jets is presented , and the conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "we consider a non - relativistic , fluid jet that propagates in a uniform medium and is in pressure equilibrium with its environment .",
    "this environment is permeated by a _",
    "passive _ magnetic field , that is advected by the fluid and has no effect in the momentum conservation equation ( @xmath2 ) . under these conditions ,",

    "( [ kard ] ) under the hypothesis that the initial distribution function is a power - law . as time elapses , synchrotron losses and adiabatic effects",
    "modify the shape of the distribution function in the high and low energy ranges of the spectrum respectively , and therefore the distribution function evolves in time departing from a power - law . in absence of shocks , one could adopt the kardashev solution at any time , but shocks introduce discontinuities in the evolution ; when the parcel has crossed a shock wave , the new initial condition for the integration of eq .",

    "is much smaller than both the synchrotron time @xmath56 , and the dynamical time for shock evolution ( @xmath57 ) , we can apply the stationary diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) model ( see for example drury 1983 for a review ) .",
    "these conditions are fully verified in the energy interval over which our electron distribution is allowed to vary , as it was defined above .    according to this model",
    ", the downstream number of particles distribution @xmath58 is related to the upstream distribution @xmath59 by : @xmath60 with @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the shock compression ratio , and @xmath63 is the minimum electron energy in the pre - shock distribution function .",
    "this equation is derived from the equation for the particle density distribution function @xmath64 ( see for example kirk 1994 ) ,    @xmath65    and the substitution @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the volume occupied by the particles , yields the compression ratio @xmath23 at the denominator of eq .

    "we have carried out a simulation with a fluid jet defined by the following parameters : mach number @xmath70 , density ratio @xmath71 .",
    "we studied the evolution of the distribution functions associated with 10 lagrangian test particles , whose initial positions are given in table 1 ; the initial spectral index for the distribution functions was @xmath72 . consistently with the assumed boundary conditions , particles leaving the domain on the right boundary at @xmath73 are re - injected at @xmath38 , and those leaving the domain at the upper boundary @xmath74 are lost .",

    "5 we show the values of the radio spectral index calculated at each shock for each of the 10 lagrangian particles .",
    "the dotted lines define the time intervals used in table 4 . from the figure it is clear how the spectral index starts from an initially high value ( here the first linear phase",
    "is not represented , and so the values derived from the values of @xmath75 at @xmath76 in table 3 are not shown ) , and it decreases as the particles enter a higher and higher number of shocks , during the acoustic phase of the instability .",
    "when the jet enters the mixing phase , shocks become rare and weak , and the spectral index increases .",
    "this is an interesting point , because the final increase in the spectral index is a feature which comes out from the evolution of the instability , and does not depend on the initial parameters or assumptions of our model ; on the contrary , assuming a different initial slope for the electrons spectrum could give a different trend for the spectral index in the shock - dominated region of the jet : for example , if the electrons were injected directly at the beginning of the acoustic phase , they would not undergo the heavy losses and steepening as it happens in the first linear phase of the evolution ; a different trend could also be obtained abandoning the assumption of lagrangian advection of the particles by the fluid , or if , following a different choice of the initial jet parameters , many more shocks were involved or shocks with stronger compression ratios . in this way ,",
    "the decreasing trend would be probably limited to the first section of the knots chain , and would be followed by a region of quasi - constant or increasing spectral index .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the trend in the radio spectral index observed in a number of extragalactic radio jets : for example , sparks et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and meisenheimer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that in m87 the spectral index oscillates around the mean value for the first section of the knot chain , and increases for the farthest knots from the source , and this is a feature common to all the frequency ranges that were studied ; in ngc 6251 the spectral index is almost constant along the jet , with oscillations around the mean value @xmath77 , and it shows a gradual steepening to 0.8 shortly before the jet widens up and mixes with the diffuse lobe emission ( mack et al . 1998 ) and perley et al .",
    "( 1984 ) ; similar values and trends are also observed in cen a ( burns et al .",
    "1983 ) , 3c 279 ( de pater & perley 1983 ) and 3c 31 ( strom et al . 1983 ) .",
    "fig . 5 and table 3 show that the value reached by the spectral index is not strictly correlated to the initial radial position of the lagrangian particle in the jet : a small number of close strong shocks can flatten the electrons distribution function in the same way as a higher number of distributed shocks .",
    "the particles initially located nearer to the jet axis , nevertheless , show a quasi - constant spectral index for a longer time : compare for example particles 1,2,6,7,8 which cross a high number of shocks , to particles 4,5,9,10 whose spectrum is flat instead only for a limited interval of time .",
    ", corresponding to the shock - dominated stage of the evolution , title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "6 the values and evolution of the spectral index @xmath78 associated to particle 1 in the different frequency ranges are compared .",
    "energetic electrons undergo synchrotron losses more rapidly , and the high energy section of the spectrum steepen more quickly .",
    "this leads to a higher average value of the spectral index in the optical - uv region respect to the radio value and a shorter temporal ( and thus spatial ) extent of the region where the spectrum is flatter ; @xmath79 starts to grow already before the onset of the mixing phase .",
    "7a shows the behavior of the spectral index @xmath78 for the post - shock distribution function ( stars ) as well as for the inter - knot regions ( continuous line ) . in fig .",
    "7a the temporal evolution has been translated into a spatial evolution , and the values of the spectral index are plotted as a function of the distance of the particle from the injection point . the trend in fig .",
    "7a reproduces qualitatively the behavior of the optical and radio - optical spectral index observed by meisenheimer at al .",
    "( 1996 ) for m87 , although in our model the oscillations between the values in knot and inter - knot regions have a bigger amplitude at the beginning of the shock chain , while just before the onset of the mixing phase the pattern is almost constant ; in m87 , which is the only object which can be observed with enough resolution to provide these data , the knot to inter - knot differences are always smaller than @xmath80 , while in our case the average value is @xmath81 .",
    "7 only shows the section of the jet where shocks are present .",
    "the first section , where the perturbation grows according to the linear theory , corresponds to the _ gap _ between the source and the first bright knot observed in most astrophysical jets .",
    "if we adopt for the jet radius an average value estimated for a typical radio jet ( see table 2 ) we find consistent values for the inter - shock distances between our model and the inter - knot distances that are generally observed , while the length of the emission gap in our model is an order of magnitude larger than observed . however , we recall that the simple cylindrical geometry adopted here forces us to select an average , constant value for the jet radius ( and for all the physical parameters in general ) , while it is well known that in the inner regions the jet radius can be up to two orders of magnitude smaller ( in the case of m87 , for example , the jet radius is below the hst 0.03@xmath82 resolution ( i.e. @xmath83 pc ) close to the source , biretta ( 1998 ) , and increases with distance with an opening angle @xmath84 at vla wavelengths ) .",
    "bearing this in mind , a gap of @xmath85 50 jet radii from the source , where the first shock forms , would correspond to a distance consistent with the gaps that are currently observed in radio jets .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "7b shows the spatial trend of the cutoff frequency @xmath86 hz as it results from the evolution of the cutoff energy along the jet for particle 1 .",
    "the values of the peaks in fig .",
    "7b are model - dependent , i.e. they depend on the maximum value that the electron energy can attain in our model since we assume that at shocks the electrons are re - accelerated up to the initial maximum energy value @xmath87 .",
    "this assumption only influences the peak values : other simulations performed assuming different values for the maximum allowed energy gave an exactly similar trend , with different peak heights ( but same widths ) .",
    "our results imply that while the knots regions are bright at least up to optical frequencies , in the inter - knot regions only radio emission can take place .",
    "therefore , as long as the cutoff frequency is concerned , our simplified model does not explain the features observed in the m87 jet , where meisenheimer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find that the cutoff frequency in the inter - knot regions lies in the optical region of the spectrum .",
    "the authors report that the cutoff frequency changes by no more than a factor 3 along the jet . even if we smooth our data at the resolution of meisenheimer et al . we still find variations in @xmath88 of two orders of magnitude , and",
    "@xmath89 in the inter - knot regions , rendering them optically invisible .",
    "we presented a self - consistent study of particles shock acceleration , in the test particle approximation , in an astrophysical jet .",
    "we found that the non linear growth of the kelvin - helmholtz instability is able to produce a high number ( @xmath90 ) of strong shocks where the energy of a distribution of relativistic electrons advected by the fluid can be increased via the first order fermi - like mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "the acceleration process is efficient enough to compete with the losses via synchrotron radiation and adiabatic expansion taking place in the whole body of the jet ; the flattening in the energy distribution function of the electrons gives rise to a flat frequency spectrum of the synchrotron radiation emitted which can be directly compared with observations .",
    "we discussed the acceleration process connected to the subsequent phases of the instability evolution ; involving 10 lagrangian parcels of the same initial distribution function located at different initial positions allowed us to find that the acceleration process is not dependent on the initial distance of the particles from the jet axis .",
    "moreover we found that the total number of relativistic electrons associated to each lagrangian particle is conserved during the whole evolution , up to the final stages when shocks can not form any more and the electrons simply lose energy becoming non - relativistic .",
    "a further improvement of our model would be the adoption of a numerical code written to solve the full magnetohydrodynamical equations : this would give the proper evolution of the magnetic field , whose components in our calculations are simply advected by the fluid . a situation in which the force exerted by the magnetic field on the fluid is taken into account",
    "could probably lead to a reduction of the shock strength , but it might also imply a longer duration of the shock - dominated phase of the instability evolution .",
    "the problems arising in the development of a reliable multidimensional mhd code have up to now limited the numerical study of magnetized jets .    from our results we were able to evaluate the average values for the spectral index of the emitted synchrotron radiation in different frequency ranges , obtaining values consistent with those derived from observations of extragalactic jets .",
    "we also gave estimates of the cutoff frequency expected in the knots and in the inter - knot regions of the jet .",
    "although the main aim of this work was to give a physical description of how the diffusive acceleration mechanism can work in a kelvin - helmholtz unstable jet , we could also derive the trends of the above described observational quantities with the position along the jet axis , and this was achieved translating our results in time into behavior with space .",
    "it is necessary to keep it into account when we refer for example to fig . 7 : the plots in fig .",
    "7a and 7b are not snapshots of the jet at a certain time , but are obtained following a parcel of the jet material as it moves downstream , thus evolving both in space and in time . for a more realistic application to observational data of the mechanism described in this paper , a ` spatial ' analysis of the evolution of a jet propagating in a medium with decreasing density is required , in order to obtain snapshots of the whole ( non - cylindrical ) jet at selected times ; this implies the adoption of large grids ( see for example micono et al . , 1998 ) and consequently of a large number of lagrangian particles , to cover with a good statistic the whole jet body ; in this way we could also obtain indications on the variation of the density of the lagrangian particles in different jet zones , and thus on their relative brightness .",
