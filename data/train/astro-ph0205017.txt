    "hydrodynamics is a powerful tool to study various astrophysical phenomena , from those associated with compact objects up to large - scale structure formation .",
    "for example , when investigating gravitational instability of cold dark matter for structure formation , analyses are easier to handle by adopting a hydrodynamical description , rather than by trying to solve the boltzmann equation of a self - gravitating n - particles system .",
    "the linear perturbation theory of a homogeneous and isotropic universe  @xcite is a typical case , which gives a qualitative estimate for gravitational instability .",
    "it is based on the eulerian picture of hydrodynamics , while approximations based on the lagrangian hydrodynamics has been recognized to be more useful , such as the celebrated zeldovich approximation  @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with an approximation theory of gravitational instability based on the lagrangian hydrodynamics .",
    "although the zeldovich approximation has been found to give an accurate description up to the stage where density perturbations grow to be unity , it involves a serious shortcoming that it can not be applied after caustics in the density field are formed . in the zeldovich approximation ,",
    "the fluid elements continue to move in the directions that are determined by initial conditions all the time , and consequently high density regions such as ` pancakes ' can not stay compact beyond the caustic formation , while numerical simulations have shown the presence of clumps with a very wide range in mass at any given time  @xcite .",
    "moreover , once caustics in the density field are formed , a hydrodynamical description itself is not valid in general .",
    "then , do we have to abandon a hydrodynamical description and try to solve the boltzmann equation , or tackle n - body simulations ? in order to proceed with a hydrodynamical description without the formation of caustics , the ` adhesion approximation '",
    "@xcite has been proposed , in which an artificial viscosity term is added to the zeldovich approximation .",
    "this modified approximation successfully describes the stage where the original zeldovich approximation breaks down , but the physical origin of the viscosity term should be clarified .",
    "some remarkable works have been done on this issue ; buchert and domnguez  @xcite argued , by beginning with the collisionless boltzmann equation  @xcite , that the effect of velocity dispersion become important beyond the caustics , where multi - stream flow arises , and the presence of velocity dispersion of the flow can yield pressure - like or viscosity terms ; buchert et al .",
    "@xcite showed how the viscosity term is generated by a pressure - like force of a fluid under the assumptions that the peculiar acceleration is parallel to the peculiar velocity ; domnguez  @xcite clarified that a hydrodynamic formulation is achieved via a spatial coarse graining in a many - body gravitating system , and the ` adhesion approximation ' can be derived by the expansion of coarse - grained equations with respect to the smoothing length .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in these works , they also obtained implications for an ` equation of state ' , which is a phenomenological relationship between kinematical pressure @xmath1 and mass density @xmath2 .",
    "buchert and domnguez  @xcite found that , if the effect of velocity dispersion is small and the velocity dispersion is approximately isotropic , the equation of state should take the form @xmath3 ; buchert et al .",
    "@xcite showed that an adhesion - like equation can be derived if the equation of state is assumed as @xmath4 ; moreover , a plausible value of the polytropic index @xmath5 has been found to be close to @xmath6 from cosmological n - body simulations  @xcite . from these aspects , it is of interest to extend a lagrangian perturbation scheme to a fluid with pressure , and to explore how the scheme works as an approximation for cosmological structure formation .",
    "actually , adler and buchert  @xcite and morita and tatekawa  @xcite have formulated perturbation theory in the lagrangian hydrodynamics , taking into account the pressure effect under the assumption that the pressure is a function of the mass density only . in our earlier work",
    "@xcite , imposing a polytropic relation as the equation of state , we solved the lagrangian perturbation equations up to second order for cases where the equations are solved easily , and showed illustrative examples with the solutions in a one - dimensional system . in particular , the second - order solutions were obtained only for the case in which the polytropic index @xmath7 is @xmath0 , while a plausible value of @xmath7 seems to be larger , as was mentioned above . in this paper , we extend our earlier work by solving the first - order perturbation equations in generic background universes and the second - order perturbation equations for wider range of a polytropic index , and by presenting illustrations in one- and two - dimensional systems .",
    "we examine how the behavior of the perturbation solutions , and the resultant evolution of inhomogeneities , change for the variation of the polytropic index .",
    "this enables us to discuss whether , or for what kind of the equation of state , the adhesion - type approximation is realized in the lagrangian perturbation scheme .",

    "consequently our perturbation scheme may work like the ` truncated zeldovich approximation '  @xcite , which yields a coarse - grained density field of the original zeldovich approximation .",
    "we have developed a perturbation theory in the lagrangian hydrodynamics for a cosmological fluid with pressure .",
    "hydrodynamic equations in the lagrangian coordinates have been solved perturbatively up to second order , extending our earlier work . in our earlier work",
    "@xcite , we solved the first - order perturbation equations in the einstein - de sitter background , and the second - order ones explicitly for the case @xmath141 . in this paper , we have obtained the first - order solutions in non - flat backgrounds and flat backgrounds with @xmath74 , and the approximate second - order solutions for the case @xmath8 .",
    "we have found that in several cases , the first - order solutions are written in terms of gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "we have also presented illustrations in one- and two - dimensional systems , showing how our approximation theory describes the evolution of cosmological inhomogeneities .    in sec .",

    "our numerical calculations have also shown the difference between the lagrangian first - order and second - order approximations , smaller than that in the @xmath127 case .",
    "let us investigate the reason of the smallness by considering single - wavemode perturbations and evaluating the ratio of the second- to the first - order solution , as we did in subsection  4.4 of ref .",

    "where @xmath199 , and thus we find @xmath200 note that the factor @xmath201 corresponds to the eulerian linear density perturbation and is of order unity at most in our case .",
    "then we can show that @xmath202 , since the assumption @xmath197 is equivalent to @xmath203 .    in the above estimation ,",
    "the second - order solution @xmath204 is of purely pressure origin because of the one - dimensionality , and thus can be regarded as a measure of the ` second - order pressure effect ' .",
    "manifestly the effect of @xmath204 becomes weaker in time as we take the larger value of @xmath7 .",
    "this curious fact is exactly the same as what we have addressed at the end of secs .",
    "[ sec : first ] and [ sec : second ] .",
    "now let us examine the cause of the fact .",
    "we remark the terms of pressure origin in the perturbation equations , eqs .",
    "( [ ddots ] ) , ( [ ddotzetal ] ) , and ( [ lap - ddotzetat ] )",
    ". then we see that all the terms of pressure origin have time - dependent coefficients such as @xmath205 and @xmath206 , which behave as @xmath207 under the assumption @xmath208 .",
    "these coefficients originate from the perturbation scheme , and we can safely claim that these coefficients yield the curious behavior of the perturbation solutions .",
    "in addition , these coefficients will appear at any order in the perturbation scheme , and therefore the curious behavior will arise , i.e. the larger value of @xmath7 will produce the weaker effect of pressure at any order , as far as we consider the lagrangian perturbation scheme . our two - dimensional illustration also indicates how the evolution of inhomogeneities is sensitive to the variation of @xmath7 ; the pressure works effectively in the @xmath141 case , but does not in the @xmath142 case , although it depends on the choice of values of parameters in general .",
    "buchert et al .",
    "@xcite argued that the @xmath209 case corresponds to the adhesion approximation  @xcite , but , considering our illustration , it seems difficult to realize the adhesion - like approximation in the @xmath209 case within the lagrangian perturbation scheme .",
    "however , there should be no such curious matter in the exact level of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "to see this , let us consider the one - dimensional case , where the relation between the eulerian and the lagrangian coordinates are given as @xmath210 under the assumption @xmath80 , the exact equation for @xmath211 is  @xcite @xmath212 where the fourth term of the left - hand side holds the pressure effect .",
    "this term also has the time - dependent coefficient , @xmath205 , but simultaneously includes the effect of inhomogeneities by @xmath213 in the denominator .",
    "as long as @xmath214 , the results of the perturbation theory are reproduced , but once the flow lines of the fluid approach to the shell - crossing singularities , @xmath215 , the effect of inhomogeneities becomes strong .",
    "in this situation , the larger value of @xmath7 gives the stronger effect of pressure , and thus no curious matter will arise .    in our earlier work , and also in this work",
    ", we have experienced the shell - crossing problem in spite of taking into account the pressure effect . however",
    ", we can expect that this problem will also be avoided in the exact level , because the fourth term of the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ exact1d ] ) will become very large near shell crossing , @xmath215 , and will stop the growth of density enhancement .",
    "( some implication may be obtained by gtz  @xcite , who solved the one - dimensional exact equation for the case @xmath216 without cosmic expansion . )",
    "the above discussion implies that we have to admit that our perturbation scheme yields some artificial results .",
    "this is true , but the lagrangian perturbation scheme is a natural way to solve the hydrodynamic equations in cosmology , and our formulation will give a useful tool for large - scale structure formation in a practical sense .",
    "it is , in principle , applicable to any cosmological situation in which velocity dispersion arises and is written as a function of the density only .",
    "actually fig .",
    "[ fig:2d - a3000 ] has shown that our scheme works better than the zeldovich approximation beyond shell crossing , giving some kind of spatial coarse graining of the density field , as is given by the truncated zeldovich approximation  @xcite .",
    "detailed analyses of comparison of our scheme and the truncated zeldovich approximation ( and also the adhesion approximation ) will be provided in a separate publication .    as for the shell - crossing problem , matarrese and mohayaee  @xcite",
    "have treated it in lagrangian perturbative approach for two - component fluid .",
    "they also experienced shell crossing in usual perturbative lagrangian approach , and introduced the ` stochastic adhesion ' model to overcome the problem .",
    "it will be interesting to probe how to treat the dynamics when shell crossing is occurring , or how to avoid shell crossing by taking account of the pressure effect in a sophisticated manner .",
