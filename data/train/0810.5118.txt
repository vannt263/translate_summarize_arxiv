    "due to this intimate connection to cosmology , the values of halo parameters are not arbitrary .",
    "the most well - known description of cdm halo behavior is the cuspy nfw halo where @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the rotation curves of these halos are parameterized by two numbers : the concentration , @xmath0 , and a characteristic velocity , @xmath5 .",

    "this @xmath6 relation , combined with the cosmological constraints on @xmath0 , means that the expected rotation curve for a cdm halo of a given mass is well - determined .    though the need for dark matter in disk galaxies has long been indicated by flat rotation curves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has been less obvious that the dark matter halos are consistent with cuspy cdm halos .",
    "because low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are thought to be dark matter - dominated down to small radii ( de blok & mcgaugh 1996 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; borriello & salucci 2001 , but see fuchs 2003 ) , their kinematics have been used as probes of the density distribution of galaxy mass dark matter halos .",

    "ugc  4325 is one of the most nearby ( @xmath27 mpc ) and well - resolved galaxies in our sample .",
    "diffuse  emission was abundant in the galaxy and was detected in almost all of the  fibers .",

    "first , as evidenced by the very small residuals of the mock  velocity field , the  instrument _ is _ able to successfully detect an nfw velocity field .",
    "the residuals are generally @xmath28 5 km s@xmath26  across the entire observed area .",
    "this means that observed  velocity fields are not inconsistent with nfw halos because of an inadequacy of the experimental design or analysis .",
    "second , the observed  velocity field of ugc  4325 is not consistent with the axisymmetric nfw@xmath11 halo ; most of the residuals are @xmath13 10 km s@xmath26 , and there is a significant region of @xmath13 15 km s@xmath26  residuals near the center . for ugc  4325 , and the other lsb galaxies in our sample , 15 km s@xmath26  residuals",
    "are non - trivial .",
    "the observed fiber - to - fiber velocity dispersions are @xmath13 6 - 10 km s@xmath26  , and since mass scales as @xmath29 , the implied mass difference is a factor of two or more .",
    "in addition , noncircular motions caused by disk instabilities , such as spiral or bar modes , are expected to be small in lsb galaxies .",
    "the low surface mass densities of the disks provide little self - gravity to drive such modes , and their high dark matter content provides a higher degree of stabilization than in high surface brightness galaxies @xcite .    at the bottom of figure 1",

    "the recovered mock rotation curve is consistent with the input rotation curve ( @xmath30 ) out to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is defined to be the radius at which the observed  rotation curve and the input axisymmetric nfw@xmath11 rotation curve begin to overlap .",
    "this shows that accurate extraction of the rotation curve of an axisymmetric nfw halo with rotcur is _ also _ possible .    in figure 2",
    "we show similar plots for f583 - 4 .",
    "this galaxy has lower spatial resolution ( @xmath33 mpc ) than ugc  4325 and only a single pointing of  coverage .",
    "the velocity fields , residuals , and rotation curves show that despite the reduced sampling and lower data quality , an axisymmetric nfw halo can still be detected if present .",
    "while the differences between the observed and mock velocity field residuals are not as pronounced as in the ugc  4325 case , the input nfw rotation curve is successfully recovered by rotcur ( @xmath34 ) .    the velocity field and rotation curve data and simulations plotted in figures 1 and 2 together",
    "show that the  ifu and the tilted - ring fitting program rotcur are able to successfully identify an axisymmetric nfw halo in data of both high and low quality , if one is present .",
    "that the and samples of  observations are inconsistent with nfw halos suggests that if the underlying halo potential is nfw , it must not be an axisymmetric nfw potential .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as cdm simulations suggest that the halo potentials are triaxial ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we next consider non - axisymmetric two - dimensional nfw potentials with axis ratios @xmath21  @xmath35  1 that are constant with radius .",
    "these 2d potentials are equivalent to 3d prolate dark matter halos in which the long axis of the halo coincides with the elongated axis of the disk .",
    "we simulate halos with axis ratios @xmath21 = 0.98 , 0.96 , 0.94 , 0.92 , 0.90 , 0.88 , 0.86 , and 0.84 , similar to the range of non - axisymmetry seen in the cdm simulations of @xcite .",
    "because axisymmetry has been broken ( @xmath36 ) , the test paticles are no longer moving on circular orbits and not all lines of sight in the plane of the disk are equivalent .",
    "this means that the observed mock  velocity field and derived rotation curve are affected not only by the value of @xmath21 , but also by the orientation ( @xmath37 ) of the potential s elongation with respect to the observer s line - of - sight ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the potential is elongated along the observer s line - of - sight in the @xmath38 case , whereas in the @xmath39 case , the potential is elongated perpendicular to the observer s line - of - sight . for 0@xmath40 ,",
    "the elongation is at an intermediate viewing orientation . for each value of @xmath21 ,",
    "the orientation of the potential is set to @xmath41 , 30@xmath42 , 45@xmath42 , 60@xmath42 , and 90@xmath42 .      in figures 4 and 5",
    "we show a series of mock  velocity fields for two galaxies representative of the range of data presented in and : ugc  4325 and ugc  5750 .",
    "as previously mentioned , ugc  4325 has high spatial resolution and extended  coverage . as in the axisymmetric case ,",
    "5 pointings of the  array are overlayed on these new non - axisymmetric simulations .",
    "in contrast , ugc  5750 is a more distant galaxy ( @xmath43 mpc ) and both the real galaxy and the simulations have only one pointing of  coverage .    these are simulations of non - axisymmetric nfw halos that obey the cosmic @xmath6 relation .",
    "the virial velocity @xmath5 has been chosen to match each galaxy ( the nfw@xmath11 halos of and ) . in this section ,",
    "we explore the effect of introducing a non - axisymmetric potential with equal squashing @xmath21 at all radii .    in the @xmath44 simulations ,",
    "the potential is nearly circular . throughout their orbits ,",
    "the particles maintain a roughly constant distance from the center of the potential and as a result , have approximately constant orbital speeds .",
    "the viewing angle therefore has little effect on the observed velocity field .",
    "the @xmath45 mock velocity fields appear very similar , looking not only to be consistent with different realizations of the same underlying potential , but also very much like the mock velocity field of the axisymmetric potential .",
    "the same can not be said for the mock velocity fields of the @xmath46 simulations . with orbits deviating significantly from circular , a particle s orbital speed depends on its location , making the viewing angle quite important .",
    "in the @xmath38 orientation , the particles moving along the observer s line - of - sight are traveling along the long axis of the potential and are moving at the maximum orbital speed .",
    "these particles are moving faster than particles on circular orbits at the same radius .",
    "the minimum - maximum velocity range observed by  is larger than what is observed in the axisymmetric case , and the derived rotation curves will reach higher velocities .",
    "the opposite situation is happening in the @xmath39 orientation . in this case",
    ", the particles moving along the observer s line - of - sight are traveling at the minimum orbital speed and the minimum - maximum velocity range observed by  is smaller than what is observed in the axisymmetric case .",
    "the rotation curves derived from these data will therefore be suppressed .",
    "the difference between the observed velocity ranges of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 velocity fields becomes more exaggerated the more noncircular the potential becomes .",
    "some ( @xmath47 ) combinations can automatically be excluded as possible descriptions of the observed  galaxy data based simply on the mock velocity fields they produce .",
    "the observed  galaxy velocity fields put constraints on the allowable velocity range of the mock velocity fields , as well as the correlation between velocity and position .",
    "regardless of how the mock rotation curves may turn out , if the observed and mock velocity fields do not match , the corresponding simulation is not a viable solution .",
    "for example , the ( @xmath48 ) = ( 0.88 ,  0@xmath42 ) mock velocity field of ugc  4325 shown in figure 4 can rule out that particular axis ratio / viewing orientation combination for that galaxy .",
    "overall , the mock velocity field covers a much larger velocity range than the ugc  4325 data , and when the velocities at the same positions in the two velocity fields are compared , they are inconsistent over a large portion of the observed area .",
    "because of the rapidly rising velocities at the centers of nfw halos , the isovelocity contours of nfw velocity fields are pinched in the central regions @xcite .",
    "this pinch is a distinctive signature of the cuspy nfw halo .",
    "if the velocity field is noisy or has high velocity dispersion , the pinch is more difficult to see .",
    "we can quantify the pinch by measuring velocities along slits that are offset from , and parallel to , the minor axis of the velocity field .",
    "it is in this fashion that we compare the appearance of the ugc  4325  velocity field and three mock velocity fields . in figure 6 , we have placed a 3@xmath49 slit ( the width of a  fiber and the width of the  array , respectively ) 6@xmath14 away from each side of the minor axis ( about the separation of two rows of   fibers ) of the observed  velocity field of ugc  4325 and the axisymmetric nfw mock velocity field ( both shown in figure 1 ) , as well as the ( @xmath47 ) = ( 0.88 ,  0@xmath42  and  90@xmath42 ) mock velocity fields in figure 4 .",
    "when we plot the average of the measured velocities as a function of position along the slit , we can readily see that of the 3 mock velocity fields , it is the one produced by the ( @xmath47 ) = ( 0.88 ,  90@xmath42 ) potential that is most like the data . at the same position in the velocity fields , the axisymmetric , and especially the ( @xmath47 )",
    "= ( 0.88 ,  0@xmath42 ) , mock observations are detecting velocities much higher than the galaxy data .    in the next section",
    "we derive mock rotation curves for all the mock   velocity fields and examine the effect that the asymmetry of the potential has had on both the normalization and shape of the derived rotation curves .",
    "the lsb galaxies observed with  in and surely have some level of noncircular motions , but we have assumed only circular motion when deriving the rotation curves with rotcur ; we treat the mock observations the same way . the test particles are , by construction , no longer on circular orbits in these non - axisymmetric potentials , but because we did not correct for this in the real data , we do not correct for it in the mock observations .",
    "any errors in the galaxy rotation curves which may have resulted from the assumption of circular motion will be reproduced in the rotation curves of the mock observations .    in figure 7",
    "we show the mock rotation curves for the non - axisymmetric simulations of the well - resolved galaxy ugc  4325 .",
    "each panel shows the observed rotation curve of ugc  4325 along with the @xmath38 , 30@xmath42 , 45@xmath42 , 60@xmath42 , and 90@xmath42 mock rotation curves for a single value of @xmath21 .",
    "similar to the trends seen in the mock velocity fields , we find that as the axis ratio decreases and the potential becomes increasingly more elongated , the influence of the viewing angle on the inferred rotation curves becomes more striking : the mock rotation curves for the different values of @xmath37 spread farther out in velocity space .",
    "we can quantitatively measure and compare the shapes of these rotation curves using the ratio of the radii containing 80% and 50% of the velocity at @xmath32 .",
    "the average values of r@xmath50/r@xmath51 for the ugc  4325 @xmath52 0.98 , 0.90 , and 0.86 mock rotation curves , for example , are 2.7@xmath530.7 , 2.8@xmath530.8 , and 3.1@xmath530.7 , respectively .",
    "_ this indicates that the overall shapes of the mock rotation curves are not changing significantly as @xmath21 or @xmath37 change ; it is the normalization of v(r ) , including v@xmath54 , that is shifting up or down .",
    "_ this is an important point to recognize , as it means that simply adopting a different ( lower ) value of @xmath5 for the underlying nfw halo ( which can not be done without ignoring cosmological constraints ) will not reconcile the observed and mock rotation curves ; the mock nfw rotation curve will still not fit the data properly .",
    "though none of the mock rotation curves match the shape of the entire observed rotation curve of ugc  4325 , those that are most consistent with the data at small radii are the @xmath39 mock rotation curves .",
    "this is true for all of the values of @xmath21 that were simulated , but it is the @xmath37 = 90@xmath42 rotation curves in the @xmath55 simulations that have the most overlap with the data .    as a comparison to the well - resolved observations of ugc  4325 , we show in figure 8 similar plots of the mock rotation curves for ugc  5750 . despite the lower spatial resolution",
    ", we find the mock rotation curves of ugc  5750 to behave in very much the same way as the mock rotation curves of ugc  4325 .",
    "_ we again see that the amplitude , not the shape , of the rotation curve changes as @xmath21 and @xmath37 change , with the magnitude of the change becoming more pronounced as the potential becomes more asymmetric .",
    "_ we also find that the @xmath39 mock rotation curves are again the closest to approaching the data , though substantial overlap at small and intermediate radii does not occur until @xmath56 .",
    "we examine in figure 9 how changing the input nfw halo parameters affects the mock rotation curves , specifically exploring if @xmath21 and @xmath37 can change the _ shape _ of a more slowly rising input nfw rotation curve . for both ugc  4325 and ugc  5750",
    ", we have simulated nfw halos with low values of @xmath5 and the lowest corresponding concentration within the scatter of @xcite ( ugc  4325 : @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; ugc  5750 : @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) .",
    "these new input nfw rotation curves fall between the rotation curves representing the -1@xmath25 scatter on @xmath0 and @xmath5 of the original nfw@xmath11 rotation curves .",
    "in addition , these slowly rising rotation curves overlap the observed  data at small radii , in contrast to the nfw@xmath11 rotation curves which match the data at large radii . essentially , we choose to match the inner rather than outer velocities with halos drawn from the favorable edge of the plausible cosmological distribution .",
    "for both galaxies , we find the new mock rotation curves to behave similarly to the mock rotation curves in figures 7 and 8 . as the axis ratio @xmath21 decreases , the mock rotation curves for the different values of @xmath37 scatter about the input nfw rotation curve , spreading farther out in velocity space .",
    "even though these new mock rotation curves overlap some of the observed  data at small radii , none are formally acceptable fits ( @xmath61 @xmath62 1 ) . more importantly , the shapes of the mock rotation curves are not significantly changing as @xmath21 and @xmath37 change : the average values of r@xmath50/r@xmath51 for the ugc  4325 @xmath52 0.98 , 0.90 , and 0.84 mock rotation curves are 2.3@xmath530.3 , 2.8@xmath530.4 , and 3.1@xmath531.2 .",
    "the mock ugc  5750 rotation curves are essentially flat between @xmath1310@xmath14 and @xmath1330@xmath14 , preventing useful measurements of r@xmath50/r@xmath51 . from figure 9",
    "we can see that regardless of the input nfw halo parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath37 change only the normalization , not the radial behavior , of the mock rotation curves .",
    "it is also worth stressing that , given the behavior of the mock rotation curves in figures 7 and 8 , as well as figure 9 , observers should see rotation curves with a range of normalizations : there should be rotation curves both above and below the nominal rotation curve expected from the @xmath6 relation ( compare the mock rotation curves to the dotted lines in figure 9 and the lower right panels of figures 7 and 8) .",
    "but this is , in fact , not what is observed in long - slit data @xcite .",
    "lsb and nfw rotation curves nearly always differ in the sense that the observed rotation curve velocities at small radii must increase so that the data match the models , or equivalently , the nfw rotation curve velocities must decrease so the models match the data .",
    "lsb rotation curves which are higher than nfw rotation curves are seldom found , if ever .    there is a trade - off between @xmath21 and @xmath37 such that different combinations of the two parameters can produce similar mock rotation curves . in the following section ,",
    "we explore what combination of ( @xmath47 ) minimizes the differences between the nfw halo and the  galaxy observations .",
    "we simulate the nfw@xmath11 halos rather than low @xmath5 halos like those in figure 9 because the constrained halos were required to match the velocities at the outer radii of each galaxy , a reasonable constraint since dark matter must explain the high velocities at large radii where the contribution of the baryons has fallen off .",
    "parameter space is too large to explore all possible initial halos .",
    "however , given that plausible combinations of nfw @xmath0 and @xmath5 parameters give rather degenerate rotation curves , and that @xmath21 and @xmath37 affect only the normalization , not the shape of @xmath63 , our choice should lead to fairly general results .",
    "in we showed that there is a substantial cusp mass excess near the centers of the galaxies when the nfw@xmath11 halo is used to describe the dark matter halo .",
    "evaluating the difference between the nfw@xmath11 rotation curve and the observed galaxy rotation curve in terms of mass rather than velocity , we determined that interior to the radius where the two rotation curves begin to overlap ( @xmath32 ) , nfw halos are at least twice as massive as the galaxy data will allow . in this section , we are interested in determining for each  galaxy what combination of ( @xmath47 ) minimizes the differences between the observed and mock rotation curves out to @xmath32 where , in the limit of zero stellar mass , the cusp mass excess is @xmath64 ( see table 1 ) . in this fashion , one can imagine a toy model in which the halo of a particular galaxy is squashed to the best fit ( @xmath47 ) within @xmath32 while outside of @xmath32 we have a more nearly spherical , cosmologically consistent nfw@xmath11 halo .",
    "figures 7 and 8 showed that regardless of the axis ratio , the mock @xmath39 rotation curves came closest to the observed rotation curves of ugc  4325 and ugc  5750 . to confirm that the differences between the rotation curves derived from the simulations and from the observed galaxy data are really minimized at @xmath65 and not somewhere between @xmath66 and 90@xmath42 , we ran additional simulations at @xmath67 , 85@xmath42 , 86@xmath42 , 87@xmath42 , 88@xmath42 , and 89@xmath42 .",
    "we then determined for each combination of @xmath21 and @xmath37 how well , as measured by @xmath61 , the mock and observed rotation curves matched out to @xmath32 .    in figure 10",
    ", we plot the best @xmath37 for each value of @xmath21 for each galaxy . for nearly all of the 9 simulated galaxies ,",
    "the mock rotation curves are the most consistent with the  galaxy rotation curves when @xmath37 is between 85@xmath42 and 90@xmath42 for all values of @xmath21 .",
    "a @xmath68 means that the elongated axis of the nfw potential is pointing perpendicular to our line - of - sight .",
    "this required @xmath37 is completely inconsistent with a random distribution of halo orientations on the sky .",
    "there is one galaxy in our sample , f563-v2 , which has a preferred value of @xmath37 _ other _ than 90@xmath42 .",
    "this galaxy has a bar in it @xcite .",
    "we ran additional simulations for f563-v2 found that @xmath69 is the optimal viewing angle for matching the mock rotation curves to the observed rotation curves .",
    "this position angle matches that of the bar",
    ". it would therefore seem that we have detected the expected noncircular motion associated with the bar rather than the squashing of the halo ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this result for f563-v2 confirms that we _ are _ able to detect the presence and orientation of an asymmetry in a velocity field .",
    "if the other  galaxies contain bars or are embedded in non - spherical nfw halos , we would be able to detect the asymmetry .",
    "that @xmath70 for all the other  galaxies demonstrates that either the data are inconsistent with non - axisymmetric nfw halos , or that we must accept the unlikely coincidence that all of these galaxies are oriented such that the elongated axis of the potential is perpendicular to our line - of - sight .",
    "it is not surprising that the effect goes in this sense as the rotation curves of lsb galaxies are persistently measured to be shallower than expected for nfw halos .",
    "there are two galaxies whose results are not shown in figure 10 : f563 - 1 and ngc  4395 .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is unconstrained for both of these galaxies due to the radial extent of the data . for f563 - 1 , there are only a few data points to compare between the observed and mock rotation curves .",
    "ngc  4395 is a very nearby galaxy ( @xmath71 mpc ) , and although there are many data points to compare in the rotation curves , the data probe a radius of less than @xmath13800  pc .    as discussed in ",
    "4.2 , @xmath21 and @xmath37 can be used to change the amplitude of the nfw rotation curve .",
    "they do not , however , alter the overall shape of that rotation curve .",
    "this is reflected by high @xmath61 values for the comparisons of the mock and observed rotation curves .",
    "although the @xmath61 values are typically greater than 1 , the sharp decline in @xmath61 as @xmath68 indicates that @xmath72 is truly the minimum ( see figure 11 ) , even though the mock rotation curves are not formally acceptable fits to the observed data . in figure 12 we plot the `` best - fitting '' @xmath68 rotation curves ( @xmath73 for f563-v2 ) over the observed galaxy data for each galaxy .",
    "the two galaxies with the highest spatial resolution , ddo  64 and ugc  4325 , are clear examples of how the mock rotation curve has shifted down in velocity such that the inner half of the mock rotation curve is roughly consistent with the observed data , but the outer half of the mock rotation curve falls below the observed data .    despite not being able to fully match the observed galaxy rotation curves within @xmath32 , the important trend in figures 10 and 11 , and reinforced by figures 4 - 6 ,",
    "is that @xmath37 is being driven toward 90@xmath42 if one wants to match the observed data at small radii where the cusp / core problem is most severe .",
    "this means that the elongated axis of the nfw potentials for every  galaxy ( with the exception of the barred galaxy f563-v2 ) must point perpendicular to our line - of - sight .",
    "this required @xmath37 is completely inconsistent with a random distribution of halo orientations on the sky .",
    "a non - axisymmetric potential with a fixed axis ratio may be able to bring _ parts _ of the nfw rotation curve into agreement with the observed data for individual galaxies , but in general , very peculiar , observer - dependent conditions must occur .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the mismatches between the `` best - fitting '' mock rotation curves and the data , as seen in figure 12 for example , are a result of real differences in the velocity fields ; information is not being lost or suppressed as rotcur collapses all the data contained in the two - dimensional velocity fields into a one - dimensional representation of the rotation . as was shown in figures 4 and 5 , the lowest velocity portions of a particle s orbit",
    "are being preferentially observed in the @xmath39 viewing orientation , ensuring that the observed range of velocities detected in the mock velocity fields is both small and slowly varying .",
    "but like the rotation curves show , only some parts and not all of the observed and mock data can be made to match .",
    "shown as an example in figure 13 are the observed ugc  4325  velocity field , the `` best - fitting '' @xmath39 velocity field , and the residual velocity field showing the differences between the two .",
    "while the residuals are relatively small in the central regions of the velocity field , there are multiple areas at larger radii where the residuals are in the range of @xmath13 10 - 15 km s@xmath26 , or more . as was discussed in   3 , in galaxies where the fiber - to - fiber velocity dispersions are measured to be @xmath13 6 - 10 km s@xmath26 , 15 km s@xmath26  residuals imply a significant mismatch .",
    "in this paper we have simulated the two - dimensional nfw halo and tested several modifications to the potential in an attempt to simultaneously reconcile both the nfw velocity field and rotation curve with observed  galaxy data .",
    "we have found that it is difficult to make the cuspy nfw halo appear consistent with core - like data without violating the predicted range of nfw parameters expected in the @xmath8cdm cosmological model .    beginning with simulations of an axisymmetric nfw potential",
    ", we found that both the  ifu instrument and the rotation curve fitting program rotcur are able to successfully identify the nfw potential . observed galaxy data",
    "is inconsistent with the velocity fields and rotation curves corresponding to axisymmetric nfw potentials .",
    "the simulated observations show that our data would detect the nfw cusp if it were present .",
    "we also tried a non - axisymmetric potential with a fixed axis ratio .",
    "we found that if the parameters of the nfw halo ( determined from the @xmath6 relation ) are held constant and only the axis ratio and viewing orientation are varied , parts of the mock velocity fields and mock rotation curves , but not their entire area or length , could be made to roughly match the observed galaxy data . the axis ratio and viewing orientation work to _",
    "change only the normalization , not the radial behavior , _ of the mock data .",
    "the shape of the predicted nfw rotation curve remains distinct from the observations .",
    "this remains true even if a more slowly rising nfw rotation curve is simulated .",
    "only when the elongated axis of the mock galaxies is oriented perpendicular to the observer s line - of - sight ( @xmath72 ) are the critical velocities at small radii in both the velocity fields and rotation curves consistent with observations .",
    "having all halos elongated perpendicular to our line of sight is clearly not reasonable .",
    "this constraint on @xmath37 can be relaxed if we start with an nfw halo having a lower @xmath5 ( see figure 9 ) , _ but changing the halo parameters requires that we disregard cosmological constraints .",
    "_ numerical simulations have shown that scatter in the @xmath6 relation exists ( @xmath74(@xmath75 c ) = 0.18 ; @xcite ) , but this is not enough to `` fix '' the mock nfw data , as the values of the halo parameters would have to be outside the range of the allowable dispersion .",
    "furthermore , even though lowering @xmath5 allows for more scatter in @xmath37 , the problem with the shape of the mock nfw rotation curve remains unresolved .    in order to reconcile both the entire area of the nfw mock velocity fields and the entire length of their derived rotation curves with galaxy data , we need an asymmetry that preferentially suppresses velocities at small radii .",
    "the asymmetric nfw potentials with fixed axis ratios that we have tested in this paper have altered the velocities at _ all _ radii , either suppressing all the measured velocities ( the @xmath39 case ) or boosting all of them ( the @xmath76 cases ) .",
    "one possible way to address that problem may be to invoke a non - axisymmetry that varies with radius @xcite .",
    "@xcite have suggested that galaxy - sized cdm halos are triaxial with radially varying axis ratios .",
    "they find the halo potential to be highly elongated near the center ( @xmath77/@xmath78 @xmath79 0.78 and @xmath0/@xmath78 @xmath79 0.72 ) and increasingly more spherical at large radii .",
    "this is the general behavior that the results of our two - dimensional simulations suggest is required .",
    "it remains to be seen though if such an asymmetry is a viable solution to the problem .",
    "the simulations will always be constrained by the fact that lsb galaxy velocity fields and rotation curves are slowly rising .",
    "this will lead to the problem of a preferential viewing angle that we have already encountered .",
    "any potential that deviates significantly from axisymmetry at the center will have to be viewed at an angle which lowers , not increases , the observed velocities ; the inner ellipsoid will need to be perpendicular to the line - of - sight . on the other hand ,",
    "if one insists that a radially - varying asymmetry _ is _ the correct solution and that the viewing orientation is randomly distributed , both slowly and rapidly rising lsb galaxy rotation curves should be observed .",
    "lsb galaxy rotation curves that are steeper than nfw rotation curves are not generally found .",
    "of the 50 + long - slit rotation curves in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is very common to see slowly rising rotation curves , but exceedingly rare to see rotation curves that are in excess of the expectation for nfw halos that obey the @xmath8cdm @xmath6 relation .",
    "the analysis of an nfw potential with a variable axis ratio is sufficiently complex that if one is to do it right , it should be done in three dimensions with interacting particles .",
    "if having a highly elongated potential is key to `` fixing '' the nfw velocity field and rotation curve , then adiabatic contraction should also be considered , as it will round out the inner halo potential @xcite .",
    "adiabatic contraction also has the effect of increasing the dark matter density of the halo over its initial value and serves to worsen the concentration problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore defer the analysis of a radially varying axis ratio to a forthcoming paper in which the complexity of the simulations is increased by moving to three dimensions and including gas physics .",
