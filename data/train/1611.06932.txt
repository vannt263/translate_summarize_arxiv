    "bell nonlocality is an exotic quantum phenomenon by which correlations between the outcomes of space - like separated measurements can not be explained by local hidden - variable theories , i.e. , by any classical model relaying exclusively on past common causes @xcite .",
    "apart from their fundamental implications , such nonlocal correlations have been identified as a valuable resource for practical information - theoretic tasks , such as quantum key distribution @xcite , perfect - randomness expansion @xcite and @xcite amplification , or distributed computations @xcite , e.g. these protocols exploit the nonlocal correlations shared between distant users as physical resources , and process their generated classical information locally , with the aid of a - priori communicated bits or shared randomness . in these scenarios ,",
    "bell nonlocality plays the role of an operational resource for classical - information processing , i.e. , one that can be composed , acted on , and transformed between its different forms , depending on one s needs @xcite .",
    "this is formalised by so - called _ resource theories of bell nonlocality _ @xcite .",
    "resource theories constitute powerful formalisms in quantum information for the abstract treatment of a physical property as an operational resource .",
    "they have been built also for other types of quantum nonlocality , such as entanglement @xcite and einstein - podolski - rosen steering @xcite , as well as athermal states @xcite , quantum coherence @xcite , and several other notorious properties of quantum systems ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a resource theory identifies a set of mathematical objects  describing states of the physical system under scrutiny  , a subset thereof of uninteresting objects  composed of the states without the property considered the resource in question  , and a class of free operations  consisting of physical transformations under which the resourceless subset is closed . for bell nonlocality ,",
    "two classes of free operations are well studied : one restricted to _",
    "local operations assisted by shared randomness _ ( losr ) @xcite and the other allowing also for communication that contains no information about the measurement settings of the transformed object , called _ wirings and prior - to - input classical communication _ ( wpiccs ) @xcite . until this work , it was not clear whether these two classes displayed any difference .",
    "in fact , they have sometimes been referred to as the same single class @xcite . here",
    ", we clarify this question showing that the classes are actually inequivalent .",
    "on the other hand , central to any resource theory is the distinguishability between the objects considered , and , in particular , the distinguishability between resourceful and resourceless ones .",
    "distinguishability between bell correlations _ was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . there , a measure of statistical distinguishability between the measurement outcomes of a given nonlocal device and any local one , called the statistical strength of nonlocality proofs",
    ", was put forward . however , such measure was derived from a game - theoretic perspective and consistency with resource - theoretic operational approaches to nonlocality was not checked for .    here , we study the interconnection between the two main resource theories of bell non - locality , based on the paradigms of losrs and wpiccs , in view of the operational task of distinguishing bell boxes . to begin with",
    ", we derive an explicit parametrisation for a generic wpicc map .",
    "then , we show that wpiccs can be used to increase the statistical distinguishability between two bell boxes .",
    "this is , in contrast , impossible not only with losrs , but also with the more general _ global wirings _",
    "( gws ) , defined analogously to losrs but with arbitrary nonlocal correlations playing the role of shared randomness .",
    "technically , this is proven by showing that the relative entropy between bell - box behaviors increases under wpiccs , while it can only decrease under all gws .",
    "we then move on to study the quantification of bell nonlocality with respect to the two different resource theories .",
    "in particular , we show that every nonlocality measure with respect to losrs is also a valid measure with respect to wpiccs , and that the converse holds if the quantifier satisfies the natural requirement of convexity .",
    "this leads us to a universal definition of bell non - locality monotones , consistent with both resource theories . as an example of such monotone , we provide a definition of the relative entropy of nonlocality in terms of the relative entropy between behaviors",
    "finally , we probe the three variants , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , of the statistical strength of nonlocality proofs as bell nonlocality monotones .",
    "one of them coincides with the relative entropy of nonlocality and is , therefore , automatically a nonlocality monotone .",
    "we prove that , from the other two , one is a bell nonlocality monotone whereas the other one is not even monotonous under losrs .",
    "we end up by providing physical arguments by which , from the two variants defining satisfactory non - locality measures , we find one better than the other as quantifier of the statistical strength of nonlocality proofs , even from a game - theoretic perspective . the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",

    "in this section we introduce the basics of bell nonlocality @xcite .",
    "we consider two space - like separated experimenters , alice and bob , who make local measurements on a bipartite system composed of two black - box devices .",
    "alice s box has @xmath0 $ ] measurement settings ( inputs ) and @xmath1 $ ] measurement results ( outputs ) and , similarly , bob s box admits @xmath2 $ ] inputs and returns @xmath3 $ ] outputs , where @xmath4 , and the notation @xmath5\\coloneqq\\{0,\\ldots , n-1\\}$ ] , for any @xmath6 , has been introduced . for notational simplicity , but without loss of generality , we take @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the experiment is described by a normalised bipartite conditional probability distribution @xmath9,\\ , x , y\\in[s]},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the conditional probability of obtaining the output values @xmath11 and @xmath12 given that the input values @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we refer to any normalised bipartite conditional probability distribution as a _ black - box behavior _ or , simply , _ behavior _ , for short .",
    "since the measurements constitute space - like separated events , the statistics must fulfil the no - signaling principle , given by the well - known conditions    [ eq : nosignaling ] @xmath15,\\\\ p(a|x)=&\\sum_{b'}p(a , b'|x , y ' ) \\:\\:\\ : \\forall\\ y'\\in[s],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for all @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "that is , the marginal conditional distribution @xmath18,\\ , x , y\\in[s]}$ ] ( @xmath19,\\ , y\\in[s]}$ ] ) for alice ( bob ) should not depend on bob s ( alice s ) measurement choice .",
    "we refer to the set of all behaviors that fulfil the linear constraints as @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , we denote by @xmath21 the set of all quantum behaviors , i.e. , all those that can be expressed as @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a bipartite quantum state and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are local measurement operators corresponding to alice and bob , respectively . in turn",
    ", we call @xmath26 the set of all local behaviors , i.e. , all those for which there exists a normalised probability distribution @xmath27 and two normalised conditional probability distributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 for all @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the variable @xmath31 is called a local - hidden variable and the decomposition is accordingly referred to as a local - hidden variable ( lhs ) model for the behavior .",
    "it is a well - known fact that @xmath32 finally , we say that any @xmath33 is a _ nonlocal _ behavior , and refer to this fact as _ nonlocality_.",
    "here , we focus on nonlocality as an operational resource for information - theoretic tasks .",
    "this is formalised by so - called resource theories @xcite .",
    "resource theories are composed of three main elements : _",
    "i ) _ _ mathematical objects _ describing the system under scrutiny ; _ ii ) _ a particular property of such objects considered the valuable _ resource _ ; and _ iii ) _ a class of _ free operations _ for the resource , i.e. physical transformations fulfilling the essential requirement of mapping all free objects ( i.e. , those without the resource ) into free objects . for bell nonlocality ,",
    "these three components are :    1 .",
    "behaviors @xmath34 ; 2 .",
    "nonlocality , i.e. , that @xmath35 ; 3 .   physical transformations under which @xmath26 ( the set of free objects ) is closed , i.e. , that do not create nonlocality .    importantly , the requirement that the free operations leave @xmath26 invariant is necessary but not sufficient to specify the concrete class of free operations .",
    "typically , this specification is made on the basis of the physical restrictions native of the scenario where nonlocality serves as a resource .",
    "consequently , in general , there can be multiple classes of free operations , and , therefore , of resource theories , for the same resource , as we discuss next .",
    "we restrict throughout to the paradigm of linear maps from behaviors into behaviors .",
    "each such transformation can be physically realised by wiring inputs and outputs of the initial black - box measurement devices with the inputs and outputs of other black boxes @xcite .",
    "hence , from now on , we refer to any linear black - box transformation as a _",
    "wiring_.    within a resource theory of nonlocality @xcite , a wiring @xmath36 is a free operation for nonlocality if @xmath37 @xmath38,\\ , \\chi,\\psi\\in[s_f]}$ ] represents the final behavior after the transformation @xmath36 on an initial behavior @xmath39 of the form , where @xmath40 is the conditional probability of obtaining the output values @xmath41 and @xmath42 given that the input values @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the final box .",
    "note that , in full generality , we allow the cardinality of the alphabets of inputs and outputs to change ( from @xmath45 and @xmath46 to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ) .",
    "we refer to any wiring that is a free operation for nonlocality as a _ nonlocality - free wiring _ , or , for short , simply a _",
    "free wiring_. there are two non - trivial classes of free wirings known .      the first class is called _ local operations assisted by shared randomness _ ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on the topic ) .",
    "this class , which we denote as @xmath49 , encodes the physical restriction that alice and bob can only process the classical information available _ locally _ , without any communication between them .",
    "it is composed of all wirings @xmath50 explicitly parametrised by @xmath51 , with @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are arbitrary boxes in @xmath26 .",
    "that is , the input and output dits of the initial box @xmath39 are processed ( wired ) locally , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] a ) , with ( well - normalised ) input and output behaviors @xmath53 and @xmath54 that admit both a lhv model , to produce the input and output dits of the final box @xmath55 .",
    "it is known facts that if @xmath56 then @xmath57 and if @xmath58 then @xmath59 . examples of wirings in @xmath49 are local relabelings of inputs or outputs and mixing with a local behavior @xcite .      the second class is commonly known as _ wirings and prior - to - input classical communication _",
    "this is the class @xmath60 of all wirings @xmath61 operationally defined by the following two - stage sequence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] b ) @xcite .    1",

    "[ sec : par_wpicc ] , we provide an explicit parametrisation of generic wirings in the class .",
    "the analytic expression obtained is somewhat cumbersome due to the many different options that branch off during the preparation phase , but it can be written in a simplified form as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is a linear map from @xmath20 to @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath66 for all @xmath58 . from eq .",
    ", one immediately sees that if @xmath56 then @xmath67 and if @xmath58 then @xmath68 . besides , it clearly holds that @xmath69 however , as we show in corolary [ col : non_inclu ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : wpicc_out_of_gw ] , the reciprocal turns out not to be true .    as a final but important remark , we note that , if @xmath70 , causal loops can arise due to the preparation phase .",
    "for instance , in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the initial output @xmath12 is used to choose the initial input @xmath13 .",
    "this can clearly introduce a causal loop if @xmath39 is signaling from alice to bob . if , on the contrary , @xmath71 , such problems are avoided and the preparation phase is consistent .",
    "hence , throughout , we restrict the domain of @xmath60 wirings to the set @xmath72 of no - signaling behaviors . see app .",
    "[ sec : par_wpicc ] for more details about @xmath60 .",
    "next , we consider a third class of wirings , which we call _ global wirings _ and denote by @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath73 is not a class of free operations for bell nonlocality , but it is relevant to the results we discuss below . the class is composed of all the wirings @xmath74 that act globally on the input and output dits , without any restriction of locality or even no - signaling .",
    "they process @xmath39 as an effective single - partite distribution with the inputs @xmath75 and outputs @xmath76 treated as higher - dimensional single - partite inputs and outputs , respectively .",
    "they are defined as the @xmath49 wirings but with generic ( instead of local ) boxes wired to the input and output dits of the initial box , explicitly parametrised by @xmath77 , with @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 arbitrary ( possibly even signaling ) boxes . by construction",
    ", it clearly holds that @xmath81 furthermore , for any two arbitrary behaviors @xmath39 and @xmath55 there exists @xmath82 such that @xmath83 . a simple way to see",
    "this is by constructing a global wiring @xmath74 that bypasses @xmath39 and directly generates @xmath55 , i.e. , by taking @xmath84 for all @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "clearly , such @xmath74 can map initial local boxes to arbitrary ( no - signaling as well as signaling ) final boxes .",
    "however , as we see in sec .",
    "[ sec : wpicc_out_of_gw ] , surprisingly , this does not imply that @xmath73 contains all physical wirings .    finally , since @xmath73 wirings can map no - signaling behaviors out of @xmath20 , and since @xmath60 wirings are well - defined only on behaviors in @xmath20 , @xmath73 wirings can not in general be composed with @xmath60 wirings .",
    "this suggests to consider a fourth class : the _ no - signaling wirings _ , which we denote by @xmath85 .",
    "this class comprises all global wirings for which @xmath86 , i.e. , it is defined also by eq .",
    "but with the restriction that the boxes with which the inputs and outputs of the initial behavior are wired are described by no - signaling distributions .",
    "the class @xmath85 is a highly relevant in a variety of physical scenarios .",

    "first of all , note that @xcite @xmath151 ( see app .",
    "[ sec : proof_rel_ent_stat_stre ] for an explicit proof ) .",
    "hence , the monotonicity of @xmath152 follows automatically from theorem [ theo : mon_re_bnl ] . on the other hand , for @xmath153 and @xmath154 ,",
    "monotonicity is addressed by the following two lemmas , which we prove in apps .",

    "in contrast , @xmath154 is consistent with both resource theories of bell nonlocality , the one based on @xmath49 as well as that based on @xmath60 .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth mentioning that our proof of thm .",
    "[ theor : monotuc ] directly relies on the fact that the hypothesis hl against one is testing is that @xmath145 ( see app . [ proof : lem_monotuc ] ) and does not work against stronger hypotheses .",
    "for instance , imagine the hypothetical situation of a third player , post - quantum , supporter of the hypothesis hpq that the data have been generated by a post - quantum no - signaling behavior @xmath155 and against the hypothesis hq that they have been produced by any quantum behavior @xmath156 .",

    "the proof of monotonicity given in app .",
    "[ proof : lem_monotuc ] ( specifically , lem . [ lem : decompositionuclosr ] there ) does not hold for @xmath159 under quantum wirings .",
    "we leave as an open question whether @xmath159 is a monotone under quantum wirings .",
    "we would like to finish with a few relevant remarks about our results and some open questions .",
    "first of all , at first blush , thm . [ theor : notmonotonewpicc ] ( our central theorem ) , which proves non - monotonicity of the behavior relative entropy @xmath134 under @xmath60 wirings , may give the impression that it could be possible to increase the distinguishability of a given nonlocal behavior from the local ones by a @xmath60 wiring .",
    "this would be directly relevant , e.g. , for nonlocality certification .",
    "however , we know from thm .",
    "[ theo : mon_re_bnl ] , which proves @xmath60 monotonicity of the relative entropy of nonlocality @xmath134 , that such an increase is impossible .",
    "interestingly , @xmath60 manages to increase @xmath110 but within subspaces of bounded @xmath134 .",
    "in fact , the two exemplary behaviors @xmath87 and @xmath88 given in the proof of thm .",
    "[ theor : notmonotonewpicc ] , whose relative entropy increases under a @xmath60 wiring , are both local , i.e. , both have zero @xmath134 .",
    "while we have not seriously attempted to find non - local behaviors , or a local and a nonlocal ones , for which @xmath110 increases under @xmath60s , we would not be surprised if such examples were found . a possible search strategy for them could be to consider convex combinations of the exemplary behaviors of the proof of thm .",
    "[ theor : notmonotonewpicc ] , and similar @xmath60 wirings too , and numerically optimise the measurement settings to assess @xmath110 .",
    "second , as already mentioned , another consequence of thm .",
    "[ theor : notmonotonewpicc ] is that a _",
    "bona fide _ measure of the overall distinguishability between behaviors must explicitly take into account that behaviors are multi - partite objects for which some of the inputs can be chosen depending on the outputs of other users .",
    "third , concerning the strength of nonlocality proofs , operational consistency demands that its definition incorporates bell nonlocality monotonicity as a built - in property .",
    "we have shown that the variant for which the inputs are sampled from the uniform distribution does not fulfil this .",
    "the other two variants introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , with correlated and uncorrelated inputs , are both bell nonlocality monotones , although ( as an interesting side remark ) it is an open question whether the variant with uncorrelated inputs would be consistent with an operational framework with quantum wirings . either way , from the latter two variants , the fully general one allowing for correlated inputs seems the most appropriate to us .",
    "on the one hand , we find the restriction to uncorrelated inputs unnecessary and , on the other one , the variant with correlated inputs coincide with the @xmath134 as defined directly in terms of @xmath110 .",
    "fourth , as we have discussed , since @xmath26 is closed under both @xmath49 and @xmath60 , from the mathematical point of view , both classes can be taken as valid free operations for bell nonlocality .",
    "however , from the physical viewpoint , one class could be more appropriate than the other for some situation .",
    "this depends on the natural physical constraints native of the specific task for which the nonlocal correlations are serving as resource .",
    "for instance , since @xmath60 allows for communication about inputs and outputs of the initial box , it is legitimate to ask wether @xmath60 can indeed be allowed in  say  quantum - key distribution . there , depending on the protocol , security constraints might impose @xmath49 over @xmath60 as the adequate class of harmless operations .    in conclusion , from a fundamental perspective , our work reveals unexpected features of the internal geometry of the set of wirings and characterises the connections between the two resource - theoretic paradigms for bell nonlocality . from an applied one , in turn , our findings may be relevant to the operational task of distinguishing black - box measurement devices from a restricted set of measurement settings .",
    "this may for instance be the case in nonlocality certification within cryptographic protocols . there",
    ", one may be interested in certifying a nonlocal target behavior from the same measurements used in the protocol , so that a potential eavesdropper does not know which experimental runs are used for the protocol itself and which ones for the certification .",
