    "in cosmology , almost all known general relativity ( gr ) models of the universe predict the existence of cosmological singularities with blowing up gravitational and matter field invariants .",
    "these singularities indicate the breakdown of classical theory at extreme physical conditions .",
    "the existence of the cosmological singularities in solutions to gr signals incompleteness of the classical theory .",
    "it is expected that a consistent theory of quantum gravity should resolve the classical singularities .",
    "the belinskii - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) scenario @xcite is thought to be a generic solution to the einstein equations near spacelike singularity .",
    "it has been proved that the isotropy of spacetime is dynamically unstable in the evolution towards the singularity ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that the commonly used friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model can not be used to model the very early universe .",
    "the prototype for the bkl scenario is the vacuum bianchi ix model @xcite .",
    "the building blocks of this model are the vacuum bianchi i and ii models @xcite .",
    "we expect that obtaining quantum versions of the latter models may be helpful in the quantization of the former one .",
    "the quantum bianchi ix model may enable finding the nonsingular quantum bkl theory , which could be used as a realistic model of the very early universe .",
    "the quantization of the bianchi i , ii , and ix models with the aim of resolving the classical singularity problem has already been proposed within the loop quantization approach @xcite .",
    "our investigations of the quantum bianchi i model , based on a modification of the latter method , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present article is quite different .",
    "namely , we treat the bianchi ii as a model of a single transition between two consecutive kasner s epochs of the bianchi ix dynamics only .",
    "it is not expected to be valid at the cosmological singularity .",
    "the quantization of some anisotropic cosmological models has been explored before ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but mostly within the dirac approach .",
    "our procedure involves a reduction of the dynamical constraint at the classical level , followed by quantization of true hamiltonian .    in sec .",
    "ii we first present the misner - like canonical formulation of our homogeneous models . in this approach , the universe is interpreted to be a `` particle '' with its mass depending on time and position in space @xcite .",
    "next , we find dynamical interrelations between both classical bianchi models . the quantum level is presented in sec .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation for the bianchi ii model .",
    "the solution is interpreted in terms of the `` scattering '' of the kasner universe against the potential wall of the bianchi ii universe .",
    "the asymptotic form of the solution enables determination of the scattering amplitude . in the last section",
    "we suggest that our results can be used , to some extent , as a building block of the evolution of the bianchi ix model .",
    "we assume spacetime admitting a foliation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is spacelike .",
    "the line element of the spatially homogenous , diagonal bianchi models reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 are 1-forms on @xmath1 invariant with respect to the action of a simply transitive group of motions on the leaf and subject to @xmath4 where @xmath5 are structure constants of the corresponding lie algebra . in the case of the bianchi i model one",
    "has @xmath6 for any @xmath7 .",
    "the bianchi ii model is specified by the only nonvanishing @xmath8 .",
    "one can choose @xmath9 , and its value is usually fixed by the condition @xmath10 . in what follows",
    "we keep @xmath11 as a parameter .",
    "a solution to ( [ cartan ] ) reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are coordinates on @xmath1 .",
    "we recall that in canonical relativity there are the so - called diffeomorphism constraints , which are first class and generate canonical transformations , whose action geometrically corresponds to spatial diffeomorphisms in space - time .",
    "those diffeomorphisms are viewed as coordinate transformations and , as such , are unphysical .",
    "the gauge - fixing procedure may be applied to extract the physical degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraints , however , are absent in our model because of the spatial homogeneity , which allowed us to fix the metric in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) . nevertheless , there are still some restricted ( homogeneous ) transformations of @xmath3 s so the gauge is not fixed completely and we need to fix it further .",
    "let @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 be another solution of ( [ cartan ] ) . then , because the old and the new solutions are invariant with respect to the action of the same homogeneity group , they must be related by a linear transformation @xmath19 such that @xmath20 this implies in particular that @xmath21 .",
    "thus , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 we set @xmath24 . from it easily follows that @xmath25 thus , at the level of coordinates , the possible transformation ( up to a constant shift ) is the following @xmath26 however , when combined with the requirement that @xmath19 preserves the form of the metric ( [ eq ] ) , that is @xmath27 we find that @xmath28 .",
    "now , we demand that @xmath13 and @xmath14 be coordinates on a compact manifold , say @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 , while @xmath31 .",
    "this fixes the 1-forms completely and restricts the allowed coordinate transformations as follows : @xmath32 thus , the variables @xmath33 are now physical .",
    "we assume a fiducial cell which is the cartesian product of the whole @xmath29 and any compact subset @xmath34 .",
    "the following holds : @xmath35 so even if the variable @xmath15 may be chosen only up to a shift , the volume of the patch is uniquely defined .",
    "we believe that having a well - defined volume of the fiducial cell is essential for having physically meaningful variables in the case of spatially homogeneous and noncompact universes .    due to the homogeneity of the space , the action of the _ vacuum _",
    "bianchi i and ii models takes the general form @xmath36 where ( i ) @xmath37 is the lapse function , @xmath38 is the lagrangian function of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , ( ii ) @xmath41 is the 3-form @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 denotes a finite patch in @xmath1 , over which the integration is performed .",
    "@xmath44 will be the fiducial volume in @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the models only depend on the effective gravitational constant @xmath45 .",
    "the hamiltonians read @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the conjugate momentum variable to @xmath48 , according to the poisson bracket @xmath49 .",
    "also , @xmath50 and @xmath51 correspond to the bianchi i and bianchi ii models , respectively .",
    "note that the dimension of @xmath52 reads @xmath53 = action^{-1 } length^{-1}$ ] , and assuming the @xmath33 variables to be dimensionless , the dimensions of @xmath54 and @xmath11 are @xmath55=[n_1]=length^{-1}$ ] .",
    "both systems have the dynamical constraint @xmath56 .",
    "the case of vanishing of the _ physical _ volume of the patch , @xmath57 , defines the condition for the appearance of the cosmological singularity @xcite .",
    "our paper does not address the singularity problem so the expression ( [ ham0 ] ) is well defined .",
    "our considerations concern the evolution towards the singularity excluding the singularity itself .",
    "we study possible quantum effects before physical quantities reach their critical values , at which the big bounce is expected to take place .",
    "the classical model , bianchi ii , is assumed to be valid only as a model of a single transition between two successive kasner s universes , i.e. , a patch of the evolution towards the singularity , and is not meant to be a model of the classical dynamics near the singularity .",
    "this is the reason for our placing the singularity at infinity and emphasizing the scattering picture at the quantum level . as the result , our findings are limited to a single event of the quantum evolution : the quantum transition between two kasner s epochs .",
    "it is not difficult to relate the canonical approaches developed independently by bogoyavlensky , presented in his textbook @xcite , and by misner @xcite .",
    "the latter one has been commonly used for about four decades .",
    "the former is a comprehensive analysis of the classical dynamics of all homogeneous models carried out within one formalism .    for further analysis",
    "we introduce misner s like three canonical pairs @xmath58 as follows @xmath59 @xmath60    one easily verifies that @xmath61 . the hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) in these new variables has the form @xmath62 we note that @xmath63 is a dynamical constant and that the sign of @xmath63 corresponds to the direction of evolution .",
    "we will use this fact to define the true hamiltonian of the system(s ) .",
    "the canonical 2-form @xmath64 that can be ascribed to the six - dimensional _ kinematical _ phase space of our system reads @xmath65 we restrict @xmath66 and introduce the new canonical pair @xmath67    reduction of the form ( [ b6 ] ) to constraint surface @xmath68 leads to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the true hamiltonian in the reduced formulation .",
    "thus , as one may verify that the following is satisfied : @xmath71 therefore , we have the hamiltonian system defined in the physical phase space with @xmath72 being the generator of motion and @xmath73 playing the role of time . note that the direction of evolution is set by the growth of @xmath73 , which corresponds to the contraction of universe . furthermore , by the virtue of eq . , the classical dynamics is invariant with respect to the choice of the fiducial cell @xmath43 in @xmath1 .      in what follows",
    "we find dynamical relation between the two bianchi models .",
    "this has already been done ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , to some extent , but within different parametrization of phase space and in different context . here",
    ", we use misner s like variables , which are convenient in our quantization procedure .",
    "this way we obtain the consistency between classical and quantum levels .      in the case of the bianchi i model ( @xmath89 ) ,",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) read explicitly @xmath90 @xmath91 and have the obvious solution @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 are real constants .",
    "we note that the bianchi ii solution ( [ eqq2]-([eqq3 ] ) for large @xmath95 coincides with the bianchi i solutions ( [ eqq5]-([eqq6 ] ) with@xmath96 therefore , we have explicitly shown that asymptotically , as time goes to @xmath97 , the solutions of the two bianchi models coincide .      using eqs . and and introducing the definition @xmath98 for the asymptotic value of @xmath99 at @xmath100",
    ", we see that the trajectory ( qualitatively ) looks like a reflection on an infinite wall .",
    "the position of the wall can be obtained from the turning point of the trajectory @xmath101 .",
    "we deduce from that @xmath102 , and the corresponding value @xmath103 of @xmath87 , due to , reads @xmath104 thus , the main features of the trajectories can be grasped via introducing an infinite wall approximation with the position @xmath103 of the wall being @xmath105 dependent . as will be seen later",
    ", the quantum version of the model completely modifies the position @xmath103 of the wall for small values of @xmath105 .",
    "in what follows we apply the canonical quantization method . the variables of the physical phase space satisfy @xmath106 with vanishing other poisson bracket relations ( for simplicity we use here the same notation for the poisson bracket as in the preceding section ) .",
    "to quantize the algebra ( [ ap1 ] ) we apply the schrdinger representation @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 corresponds to the action constant relevant in our case . in the following calculations we set @xmath110 to simplify expressions .",
    "the quantum operator @xmath111 corresponding to the classical hamiltonian @xmath72 of eq . reads @xmath112    since the hamiltonian @xmath111 is time independent , the stationary solution to the schrdinger equation @xmath113 can be written in the form @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , where @xmath116 therefore , the problem reduces to the problem of solving the eigen equation ( [ aap ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath117 where @xmath118 since we have @xmath119 = 0 = [ \\hat{h } , \\hat{h}_+ ] $ ] , the solution to ( [ aap ] ) can be presented in the form @xmath120 where may have only a positive continuous spectrum . ]",
    "@xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 and where @xmath124 , due to ( [ ap6 ] ) , is the solution to the eigen equation @xmath125    equation ( [ ap8 ] ) has the following unique physical solution ( no divergence for @xmath126 ) : @xmath127 where @xmath128 are modified bessel functions , and @xmath129 is a normalization factor that can be chosen to give a suitable behavior of @xmath124 .",
    "the complete eigenstate of @xmath111 reads @xmath130 using the asymptotic behavior @xmath131 and choosing @xmath132 , we obtain for @xmath133 the following asymptotic expression @xmath134 it corresponds to a normalized incoming wave @xmath135 ( incoming since @xmath136 ) , and one can verify that @xmath137 .",
    "we interpret @xmath138 to be the `` reflection '' coefficient , i.e. , the scattering amplitude .",

    "we introduce the modified classical location @xmath169 , corresponding to the nonvanishing asymptotic part of @xmath164 .",
    "we conclude that for large values of @xmath105 , classical and quantum calculations give similar results .      making the power series of @xmath143 defined in eq .",

    "this circumstance was used to consider the quantum dynamics of the bianchi ii model in terms of scattering process .",
    "however , the interpretation of the hamiltonian ( [ ap4 ] ) as that of a particle with mass dependent on its position in space is quite formal .",
    "the cosmological interpretation is that the kasner universe approaching the singularity undergoes a rapid external push to its scale factors due to the intrinsic curvature of the bianchi ii model .",
    "the results presented , for small and large values of @xmath105 , exhibit the main common features and differences between classical and quantum formulations .",
    "as expected , differences become important when the nonlocality due to quantum mechanics can not be neglected , i.e. when the uncertainty @xmath192 is very large .",
    "the bianchi ii model is important because it bridges the two kasner universes .",
    "we found that the quantization of the bianchi ii dynamics leads to a limited departure from the classical picture .",
    "roughly speaking , the classical evolution of the bianchi ix model @xcite towards the cosmological singularity can be considered to be a sequence of transitions from one kasner epoch to another one via the vacuum bianchi ii type evolution .",
    "this sequence can be divided into eras which differ from one another by oscillations of distances along different pairs of generalized kasner s axes @xcite .",
    "we are aware that the classical picture needs not extend to the quantum level .",
    "we expect that the quantum dynamics of the bianchi ii model presented in this paper may be used , to some extent , as a building block for quantum evolution of the bianchi ix model to be examined in the near future .",
