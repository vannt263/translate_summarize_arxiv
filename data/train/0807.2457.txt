    "in the last decade neutrino oscillation experiments have convincingly and triumphantly shown that neutrinos have a finite mass and that the lepton flavor is not a conserved quantity .",
    "these results opened the door to what is often called the ",
    "physics beyond the standard model \" . in other words",
    ", accommodating these findings into a consistent scenario requires generalization of the standard model of electroweak interactions that postulates that neutrinos are massless and that consequently lepton flavor , and naturally , also the total lepton number , are conserved quantities .    in oscillation experiments only the differences in squares of the neutrino masses , @xmath2 ,",
    "is measured , and the results do not depend on the charge conjugation properties of neutrinos , i.e. whether they are dirac or majorana fermions .",
    "nevertheless , from oscillation experiments one can establish a lower limit on the absolute value of the neutrino mass scale , @xmath3 .",
    "thus , one or more neutrinos have a mass of at least @xmath4 50 mev , and another one has mass of at least @xmath5 10 mev .",
    "in addition , an upper limit on the masses of all active neutrinos @xmath6 2 - 3 ev can be derived from the combination of analysis of the tritium beta - decay experiments and the neutrino oscillation experiments . combining these constraints , masses of at least two ( out of the total of three active ) neutrinos are bracketted by 10 mev @xmath7 2 - 3 ev .",
    "thus , neutrino masses are six or more orders of magnitude smaller than the masses of the other fermions .",
    "moreover , the pattern of masses , i.e. the mass ratios of neutrinos , is rather different ( even though it remains largely unknown ) than the pattern of masses of the up- or down - type quarks or charged leptons .",
    "all of these facts suggest that , perhaps , the origin of the neutrino mass is different than the origin ( which is still not well understood ) of the masses of the other fermions",
    ".    the discoveries of neutrino oscillations , in turn , are causing a renaissance of enthusiasm in the double beta decay community and a slew of new experiments that are expected to reach , within a near future , the sensitivity corresponding to the neutrino mass scale .",
    "below i review the current status of the double beta decay and the effort devoted to reach the required sensitivity , as well as various issues in theory ( or phenomenology ) related to the relation of the @xmath1 decay rate to the absolute neutrino mass scale and to the general problem of the lepton number violation ( lnv ) . and ,",
    "naturally , substantial emphasis is devoted to the nuclear structure issues .",
    "but before doing that i very briefly summarize the achievements of the neutrino oscillation searches and the role that the search for the neutrinoless double beta decay plays in the elucidation of the pattern of neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "there is a consensus that the measurement of atmospheric neutrinos by the superkamiokande collaboration@xcite can be only interpreted as a consequence of the nearly maximum mixing between @xmath8 and @xmath9 neutrinos , with the corresponding mass squared difference @xmath10 .",
    "this finding was confirmed by the k2k experiment @xcite that uses accelerator @xmath8 beam pointing towards the superkamiokande detector 250 km away as well as by the very recent result of the minos experiment located at the sudan mine in minnesota 735 km away from fermilab@xcite .",
    "several large long - baseline experiments are being build to further elucidate this discovery , and determine the corresponding parameters even more accurately .     in terms of the flavor eigenstates .",
    "the two hierarchies can not be , at this time , distinguished .",
    "the small admixture of @xmath11 into @xmath12 is an upper limit , and the mass square of the neutrino @xmath13 , the quantity @xmath14 , remains unknown .",
    ", width=340 ]    at the same time the `` solar neutrino puzzle '' , which has been with us for over thirty years since the pioneering chlorine experiment of davis@xcite , also reached the stage where the interpretation of the measurements in terms of oscillations between the @xmath11 and some combination of active , i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 neutrinos , is inescapable . in particular , the juxtaposition of the results of the sno experiment@xcite and superkamiokande@xcite , together with the earlier solar neutrino flux determination in the gallium experiments@xcite and , of course chlorine@xcite , leads to that conclusion .",
    "the value of the corresponding oscillation parameters , however , remained uncertain , with several `` solutions '' possible , although the so - called large mixing angle ( lma ) solution with @xmath15 and @xmath16 was preferred .",
    "a decisive confirmation of the `` solar '' oscillations was provided by the nuclear reactor experiment kamland @xcite that demonstrated that the flux of the reactor @xmath17 is reduced and its spectrum distorted at the distance @xmath18 180 km from nuclear reactors .",
    "the most recent kamland results @xcite , combined with the existing solar neutrino data launched the era of precision neutrino measurements , with the corresponding parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 determined with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "analysis of that experiment , moreover , clearly shows the oscillatory behavior of the detection probability as a function of @xmath21 . that behavior can be traced in ref .",
    "@xcite over two full periods .",
    "the pattern of neutrino mixing is further simplified by the constraint due to the chooz and palo verde reactor neutrino experiments@xcite which lead to the conclusion that the third mixing angle , @xmath22 , is small , @xmath23 .",
    "the two remaining possible neutrino mass patterns are illustrated in fig.[fig_osc ] .",
    "as already stated , oscillation experiments can not determine the absolute magnitude of the masses and , in particular , can not at this stage separate two rather different scenarios , the hierarchical pattern of neutrino masses in which @xmath24 and the degenerate pattern in which @xmath25 .",
    "it is hoped that the search for the neutrinoless double beta decay , reviewed here , will help in foreseeable future in determining or at least narrowing down the absolute neutrino mass scale , and in deciding which of these two possibilities is applicable .",
    "moreover , even more important is the fact that the oscillation results do not tell us anything about the properties of neutrinos under charge conjugation . while the charged leptons are dirac particles , distinct from their antiparticles , neutrinos may be the ultimate neutral particles , as envisioned by majorana , that are identical to their antiparticles .",
    "that fundamental distinction becomes important only for massive particles .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay proceeds only when neutrinos are massive majorana particles , hence its observation would resolve the question .    the argument for the  majorana nature \" of the neutrinos",
    "can be traced to the observation by weinberg @xcite who pointed out almost thirty year ago that there exists only one lowest order ( dimension 5 , suppressed by only one inverse power of the corresponding high energy scale @xmath26 ) gauge - invariant operator given the content of the standard model @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the lepton doublet , @xmath29 with @xmath30 the charge conjugation operator , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 represent the higgs boson .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking the higgs acquires vacuum expectation value and the above operator represents the neutrino majorana mass that violates the total lepton number conservation law by two units @xmath33 where @xmath34 250 gev and the neutrinos are naturally light because their mass is suppressed by the large value of the new physics scale @xmath26 in the denominator .",
    "the most popular explanation of the smallness of neutrino mass is the see - saw mechanism , which is also roughly thirty years old @xcite . in it ,",
    "the existence of heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath35 is postulated , and by diagonalizing the corresponding mass matrix one arrives at the formula @xmath36 where the dirac mass @xmath37 is expected to be a typical charged fermion mass and @xmath38 is the majorana mass of the heavy neutrinos @xmath35 .",
    "again , the small mass of the standard neutrino is related to the large mass of the heavy right - handed partner . requiring that @xmath39 is of the order of 0.1",
    "ev means that @xmath38 ( or @xmath26 ) is @xmath40 gev , i.e. near the gut scale .",
    "that makes this template scenario particularly attractive .",
    "clearly , one can not reach such high energy scale experimentally .",
    "but , these scenarios imply that neutrinos are majorana particles , and consequently that the total lepton number should not be conserved .",
    "hence the tests of the lepton number conservation acquires a fundamental importance .",
    "double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) is a nuclear transition @xmath41 in which two neutrons bound in a nucleus are simultaneously transformed into two protons plus two electrons ( and possibly other light neutral particles ) .",
    "this transition is possible and potentially observable because nuclei with even @xmath42 and @xmath43 are more bound than the odd - odd nuclei with the same @xmath44 .",
    "analogous transition of two protons into two neutrons are also , in principle , possible in several nuclei , but phase space considerations give preference to the former mode .",
    "nuclei @xmath45xe , @xmath45ba and @xmath45ce are stable against the ordinary @xmath46 decay ; hence they exist in nature .",
    "however , energy conservation alone allows the transition @xmath45xe @xmath47 @xmath45ba + @xmath48 ( + possibly other neutral light particles ) and the analogous decay of @xmath45ce with the positron emission .",
    ", width=340 ]    an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_bb ] .",
    "the situation shown there is not really exceptional .",
    "there are eleven analogous cases ( candidate nuclei ) with the @xmath49-value ( i.e. the kinetic energy available to leptons ) in excess of 2 mev .",
    "there are two basic modes of the @xmath0 decay . in the two - neutrino mode ( @xmath50 )",
    "there are 2 @xmath17 emitted together with the 2 @xmath51 .",
    "it is just an ordinary beta decay of two bound neutrons occurring simultaneously since the sequential decays are forbidden by the energy conservation law . for this mode , clearly , the lepton number is conserved and this mode of decay is allowed in the standard model of electroweak interaction .",
    "it has been repeatedly observed in a number of cases and proceeds with a typical half - life of @xmath52years for the nuclei with @xmath49-values above 2 mev .",
    "in contrast , in the neutrinoless mode ( @xmath1 ) only the 2@xmath51 are emitted and nothing else .",
    "that mode clearly violates the law of lepton number conservation and is forbidded in the standard model .",
    "hence , its observation would be a signal of a `` new physics '' .",
    "the two modes of the @xmath0 decay have some common and some distinct features .",
    "the common features are :    * the leptons carry essentially all available energy .",
    "the nuclear recoil is negligible , @xmath53 . *",
    "the transition involves the @xmath54 ground state of the initial nucleus and ( in almost all cases ) the @xmath54 ground state of the final nucleus . in few cases",
    "the transition to an excited @xmath54 or @xmath55 state in the final nucleus is energetically possible , but suppressed by the smaller phase space available .",
    "( but the @xmath50 decay to the excited @xmath54 state has been observed in few cases . ) * both processes are of second order of weak interactions , @xmath56 , hence inherently slow .",
    "the phase space consideration alone ( for the @xmath50 mode @xmath57 and for the @xmath1 mode @xmath58 ) give preference to the @xmath1 which is , however , forbidden by the lepton number conservation .",
    "the distinct features are :    * in the @xmath50 mode the two neutrons undergoing the transition are uncorrelated ( but decay simultaneously ) while in the @xmath1 the two neutrons are correlated . * in the @xmath50 mode the sum electron kinetic energy @xmath59 spectrum is continuous and peaked below @xmath60 .",
    "this is due to the electron masses and the coulomb attraction . as @xmath61 the spectrum approaches zero approximately like @xmath62 .",
    "* on the other hand in the @xmath1 mode the sum of the electron kinetic energies is fixed , @xmath63 , smeared only by the detector resolution .",
    "mode from the @xmath50 by the shape of the sum electron spectrum , including the effect of the 2% resolution smearing .",
    "the figure is for the rate ratio 1/100 and the insert for 1/@xmath64.,width=264 ]    these last distinct features allow one to separate the two modes experimentally by measuring the sum energy of the emitted electrons with a good energy resolution , even if the decay rate for the @xmath1 mode is much smaller than for the @xmath50 mode .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig_2nu ] where the insert shows the situation for the rate ratio of @xmath65 corresponding to the most sensitive current experiments .",
    "various aspects , both theoretical and experimental , of the @xmath0 decay have been reviewed many times . here",
    "i quote just some of the review articles@xcite , earlier references can be found there .    in this introductory section",
    "let me make only few general remarks .",
    "the existence of the @xmath1 decay would mean that on the elementary particle level a six fermion lepton number violating amplitude transforming two @xmath66 quarks into two @xmath67 quarks and two electrons is nonvanishing . as was first pointed out by schechter and valle@xcite more than twenty years ago , this fact alone would guarantee that neutrinos are massive majorana fermions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sv ] ) . this qualitative statement ( or theorem ) , however , does not in general allow us to deduce the magnitude of the neutrino mass once the rate of the @xmath1 decay have been determined .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that quite generally an observation of * any * total lepton number violating process , not only of the @xmath1 decay , would necessarily imply that neutrinos are massive majorana fermions .",
    "decay amplitude ( the black box ) implies the existence of the majorana neutrino mass .",
    ", width=264 ]    there is no indication at the present time that neutrinos have nonstandard interactions , i.e. they seem to have only interactions carried by the @xmath68 and @xmath42 bosons that are contained in the standard electroweak model . all observed oscillation phenomena can be understood if one assumes that neutrinos interact exactly the way the standard model prescribes , but are massive fermions forcing a generalization of the model .",
    "if we accept this , but in addition assume that neutrinos are majorana particles , we can in fact relate the @xmath1 decay rate to a quantity containing information about the absolute neutrino mass . with these caveats that relation can be expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a phase space factor that depends on the transition @xmath49 value and through the coulomb effect on the emitted electrons on the nuclear charge and that can be easily and accurately calculated ( a complete list of the phase space factors @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be found , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath72 is the nuclear matrix element that can be evaluated in principle , although with a considerable uncertainty and is discussed in detail later , and finally the quantity @xmath73 is the effective neutrino majorana mass , representing the important particle physics ingredient of the process .    in turn , the effective mass @xmath73 is related to the mixing angles @xmath74 ( or to the matrix elements @xmath75 of the neutrino mixing matrix ) that are determined or constrained by the oscillation experiments , to the absolute neutrino masses @xmath76 of the mass eigenstates @xmath77 and to the totally unknown additional parameters , as fundamental as the mixing angles @xmath74 , the so - called majorana phases @xmath78 , @xmath79 here @xmath80 are the matrix elements of the first row of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "it is straightforward to use eq.([eq_mbb ] ) and the known neutrino oscillation results in order to compare @xmath73 with other neutrino mass related quantities .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig_5 ] .",
    "traditionally such plot is made as in the left panel .",
    "however , the lightest neutrino mass @xmath81 is not an observable quantity .",
    "for that reason the other two panels show the relation of @xmath73 to the sum of the neutrino masses @xmath82 that is constrained and perhaps one day will be determined by the  observational cosmology \" , and also to @xmath83 that represent the parameter that can be determined or constrained in ordinary @xmath46 decay , @xmath84    several remarks are in order .",
    "first , the observation of the @xmath1 decay and determination of @xmath73 , even when combined with the knowledge of @xmath82 and/or @xmath83 does not allow , in general , to distinguish between the normal and inverted mass orderings .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the majorana phases are unknown . in regions in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] where the two hatched bands overlap it is clear that two solutions with the same @xmath73 and the same @xmath82 ( or the same @xmath83 ) always exist and can not be distinguished .",
    "on the other hand , obviously , if one can determine that @xmath85 0.1 ev we would conclude that the mass pattern is degenerate . and in the so far hypothetical case that one could show that @xmath86 0.01 ev , but nonvanishing nevertheless , the normal hierarchy would be established in the right panel would not represent the quatity directly related to the ordinary @xmath46 decay .",
    "there are no ideas , however , how to reach the corresponding sensitivity in ordinary @xmath46 decay at the present time . ] .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that if the inverted mass ordering is realized in nature , ( and neutrinos are majorana particles ) the quantity @xmath73 is constrained from below by @xmath60.01 ev .",
    "this is within the reach of the next generation of experiments .",
    "also , at least in principle , in the case of the normal hierarchy while all neutrinos could be massive majorana particles it would be still possible that @xmath73 = 0 .",
    "such a situation , however , requires `` fine tuning '' or reflects a symmetry of some kind .",
    "for example , if @xmath87 the relation @xmath88 must be realized in order that @xmath73 = 0 .",
    "this implies , therefore , a definite relation between the neutrino masses and mixing angles .",

    "the width of the hatched area is due to the unknown majorana phases and therefore irreducible .",
    "the solid lines indicate the allowed regions by taking into account the current uncertainties in the oscillation parameters ; they will shrink as the accuracy improves .",
    "the two sets of curves correspond to the normal and inverted hierarchies , they merge above about @xmath91 0.1 ev , where the degenerate mass pattern begins .",
    ", width=415 ]    let us finally remark that the @xmath1 decay is not the only lnv process for which important experimental constraints exist .",
    "examples of the other lnv processes with important limits are @xmath92 however , detailed analysis suggests that the study of the @xmath1 decay is by far the most sensitive test of lnv . in simple terms , this is caused by the amount of tries one can make . a 100 kg",
    "@xmath1 decay source contains @xmath93 nuclei that can be observed for a long time ( several years ) .",
    "this can be contrasted with the possibilities of first producing muons or kaons , and then searching for the unusual decay channels .",
    "the fermilab accelerators , for example , produce @xmath94 protons on target per year in their beams and thus correspondingly smaller numbers of muons or kaons .",
    "it has been recognized long time ago that the relation between the @xmath1-decay rate and the effective majorana mass @xmath73 is to some extent problematic .",
    "the rather conservative assumption leading to eq.([eq_rate ] ) is that the only possible way the @xmath1 decay can occur is through the exchange of a virtual light , but massive , majorana neutrino between the two nucleons undergoing the transition , and that these neutrinos interact by the standard left - handed weak currents .",
    "but that is not the only possible mechanism .",
    "lnv interactions involving so far unobserved much heavier ( @xmath6 tev ) particles can lead to a comparable @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "some of the possible mechanisms of the elementary @xmath95 transition ( the  black box in fig .",
    "[ fig_sv ] ) are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnv ] .",
    "only the graph in the upper left corner would lead to eq .",
    "( [ eq_rate ] ) .",
    "thus , in the absence of additional information about the mechanism responsible for the @xmath1 decay one could not unambiguously infer the magnitude of @xmath73 from the @xmath1-decay rate .",
    "-decay amplitude , width=340 ]    in general @xmath1 decay can be generated by ( i ) light massive majorana neutrino exchange or ( ii ) heavy particle exchange ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite ) , resulting from lnv dynamics at some scale @xmath26 above the electroweak one .",
    "the relative size of heavy ( @xmath96 ) versus light particle ( @xmath97 ) exchange contributions to the decay amplitude can be crudely estimated as follows  @xcite : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the effective neutrino majorana mass , @xmath100 is the typical light neutrino virtuality , and @xmath26 is the heavy scale relevant to the lnv dynamics .",
    "therefore , @xmath101 for @xmath102 ev and @xmath103 tev , and thus the lnv dynamics at the tev scale leads to similar @xmath104-decay rate as the exchange of light majorana neutrinos with the effective mass @xmath102 ev .",
    "obviously , the lifetime measurement by itself does not provide the means for determining the underlying mechanism .",
    "the spin - flip and non - flip exchange can be , in principle , distinguished by the measurement of the single - electron spectra or polarization ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in most cases the mechanism of light majorana neutrino exchange , and of heavy particle exchange can not be separated by the observation of the emitted electrons .",
    "thus one must look for other phenomenological consequences of the different mechanisms . here",
    "i discuss the suggestion@xcite that under natural assumptions the presence of low scale lnv interactions , and therefore the absence of proportionality between @xmath105 and the @xmath1-decay rate also affects muon lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes , and in particular enhances the @xmath106 conversion compared to the @xmath107 decay .",
    "the discussion is concerned mainly with the branching ratios @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where @xmath107 is normalized to the standard muon decay rate @xmath110 , while @xmath106 conversion is normalized to the capture rate @xmath111 .",
    "the main diagnostic tool in our analysis is the ratio @xmath112 and the relevance of our observation relies on the potential for lfv discovery in the forthcoming experiments meg  @xcite ( @xmath107 ) and meco  @xcite ( @xmath106 conversion ) conversion , was recently cancelled , proposals for experiments with similar sensitivity exist elsewhere . ] .    at present ,",
    "the most stringent limit on the branching ratio @xmath113 is @xcite @xmath114 and the meg experiment aims at the sensitivity about two orders of magnitude better . for the muon",
    "conversion the best experimental limit @xcite used gold nuclei and reached @xmath115 . the various proposals",
    "aim at reaching sensitivity of about @xmath116 .",
    "it is useful to formulate the problem in terms of effective low energy interactions obtained after integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom that induce lnv and lfv dynamics .",
    "thus , we will be dealing only with the standard model particles and all symmetry relations will be obeyed .",
    "however , operators of dimension @xmath117 4 will be suppressed by @xmath118 , where @xmath26 is the scale of new physics .",
    "if the scales for both lnv and lfv are well above the weak scale , then one would not expect to observe any signal in the forthcoming lfv experiments , nor would the effects of heavy particle exchange enter @xmath1 at an appreciable level . in this case , the only origin of a signal in @xmath1 at the level of prospective experimental sensitivity would be the exchange of a light majorana neutrino , leading to eq.([eq_rate ] ) , and allowing one to extract @xmath99 from the decay rate .",
    "in general , however , the two scales may be distinct , as in susy - gut  @xcite or susy see - saw  @xcite models . in these scenarios , both the majorana neutrino mass as well as lfv effects are generated at the gut scale .",
    "the effects of heavy majorana neutrino exchange in @xmath1 are , thus , highly suppressed .",
    "in contrast , the effects of gut - scale lfv are transmitted to the tev - scale by a soft susy - breaking sector without mass suppression via renormalization group running of the high - scale lfv couplings .",
    "consequently , such scenarios could lead to observable effects in the upcoming lfv experiments but with an @xmath119 suppression of the branching ratio @xmath120 relative to @xmath121 due to the exchange of a virtual photon in the conversion process rather than the emission of a real one .",
    "as a specific example let us quote the susy su(5 ) scenario where @xcite @xmath122 @xmath123 where the gaugino masses were neglected .",
    "another example is the evaluation of the ratio @xmath124 in the constrained seesaw minimal supersymmetric model @xcite with very high scale lnv and @xmath125 for a variety of input parameters .",
    "there are , however , exceptions , like the recent evaluation of @xmath126 in a variety of susy so(10 ) models @xcite with high scale lnv but with @xmath126 as large as 0.3 in one case .",
    "the case where the scales of lnv and lfv are both relatively low ( @xmath6 tev ) is more subtle and requires more detailed analysis .",
    "this is the scenario which might lead to observable signals in lfv searches and at the same time generate ambiguities in interpreting a positive signal in @xmath104 .",
    "this is the case where one needs to develop some discriminating criteria .",
    "denoting the new physics scale by @xmath26 , one has a lnv effective lagrangian ( dimension @xmath127 operators ) of the form @xmath128 where we have suppressed the flavor and dirac structures ( a complete list of the dimension nine operators @xmath129 can be found in ref .",

    "thus , as we have seen , while a substantial progress has been achieved , we are still somewhat far from being able to evaluate the @xmath1 nuclear matrix elements confidently and accurately .",
    "the topic of neutrino magnetic moment @xmath314 is seemingly unrelated to the @xmath1 decay . yet , as will be shown below , experimental observation of @xmath314 allows one to make important conclusions about the dirac versus majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "hence , it is worthwhile to discuss it here .",
    "neutrino mass and magnetic moments are intimately related . in the orthodox standard model neutrinos",
    "have a vanishing mass and magnetic moments vanish as well .",
    "however , in the minimally extended sm containing gauge - singlet right - handed neutrinos the magnetic moment @xmath314 is nonvanishing , but unobservably small @xcite , @xmath315 an experimental observation of a magnetic moment larger than that given in eq.([eq_munu ] ) would be an uneqivocal indication of physics beyond the minimally extended standard model .",
    "laboratory searches for neutrino magnetic moments are typically based on the obsevation of the @xmath316 scattering .",
    "nonvanishing @xmath314 will be recognizable only if the corresponding electromagnetic scattering cross section is at least comparable to the well understood weak interaction cross section .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath314 ( diagonal in flavor or transitional ) which can be probed in this way is then given by @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the electron recoil kinetic energy .",
    "considering realistic values of @xmath318 , it would be difficult to reach sensitivities below @xmath319 using the @xmath316 scattering .",
    "present limits are about an order of magnitude larger than that .    limits on @xmath314 can also be obtained from bounds on the unobserved energy loss in astrophysical objects . for",
    "sufficiently large @xmath314 the rate of plasmon decay into the @xmath320 pairs would conflict with such bounds .",
    "since plasmons can also decay weakly into the @xmath320 pairs , the sensitivity of this probe is again limited by the size of the weak rate , leading to @xmath321 where @xmath322 is the plasmon frequency . since @xmath323",
    "that limit is stronger than that given in eq.([eq_muesc ] ) .",
    "current limits on @xmath314 based on such considerations are @xmath324 .",
    "the interest in @xmath314 and its relation to neutrino mass dates from @xmath61990 when it was suggested that the chlorine data@xcite on solar neutrinos show an anticorrelation between the neutrino flux and the solar activity characterized by the number of sunspots .",
    "a possible explanation was suggested in ref.@xcite where it was proposed that a magnetic moment @xmath325 would cause a precession in solar magnetic field of the neutrinos emitted initially as left - handed @xmath11 into unobservable right - handed ones .",
    "even though later analyses showed that the effect does not exist , the possibility of a relatively large @xmath314 accompanied by a small mass @xmath39 was widely discussed and various models accomplishing that were suggested .",
    "if a magnetic moment is generated by physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) at an energy scale @xmath26 , we can generically express its value as @xmath326 where @xmath327 is the electric charge and @xmath328 contains a combination of coupling constants and loop factors . removing the photon from the diagram",
    "gives a contribution to the neutrino mass of order @xmath329 we thus have the relationship @xmath330 ^ 2   \\,\\,\\,{\\rm ev } , \\label{naive}\\ ] ] which implies that it is difficult to simultaneously reconcile a small neutrino mass and a large magnetic moment .",
    "these considerations are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_magmom1 ] .        this nave restriction given in eq.([naive ] ) can be overcome via a careful choice for the new physics , e.g. , by requiring certain additional symmetries @xcite .",
    "note , however , that these symmetries are typically broken by standard model interactions . for dirac neutrinos such symmetry",
    "( under which the left - handed neutrino and antineutrino @xmath196 and @xmath331 transform as a doublet ) is violated by sm gauge interactions . for majorana neutrinos",
    "analogous symmetries are not broken by sm gauge interactions , but are instead violated by sm yukawa interactions , provided that the charged lepton masses are generated via the standard mechanism through yukawa couplings to the sm higgs boson .",
    "this suggests that the relation between @xmath314 and @xmath39 is different for dirac and majorana neutrinos .",
    "this distinction can be , at least in principle , exploited experimentally , as shown below .",
    "earlier , i have quoted the ref.@xcite ( see fig.[fig_sv ] ) to stress that observation of the @xmath1 decay would necessarily imply the existence of a novanishing neutrino majorana mass .",
    "analogous considerations can be applied in this case . by calculating neutrino magnetic moment contributions to @xmath332 generated by sm radiative corrections ,",
    "one may obtain in this way general , naturalness \" upper limits on the size of neutrino magnetic moments by exploiting the experimental upper limits on the neutrino mass .",
    "in the case of dirac neutrinos , a magnetic moment term will generically induce a radiative correction to the neutrino mass of order@xcite @xmath333 ^ 2 \\,\\,\\,{\\rm ev}.\\ ] ] taking @xmath334 1 tev and @xmath335 0.3 ev , we obtain the limit @xmath336 ( and a more stringent one for larger @xmath337 , which is several orders of magnitude more constraining than current experimental upper limits on @xmath314 .    the case of majorana neutrinos",
    "is more subtle , due to the relative flavor symmetries of @xmath332 and @xmath338 respectively .",
    "for majorana neutrinos the transition magnetic moments @xmath339_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] are antisymmetric in the flavor indices @xmath340 , while the mass terms @xmath341_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] are symmetric .",
    "these different flavor symmetries play an important role in the limits , and are the origin of the difference between the magnetic moment constraints for dirac and majorana neutrinos .",
    "it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the constraints on majorana neutrinos are significantly weaker than those for dirac neutrinos@xcite , as the different flavor symmetries of @xmath332 and @xmath338 lead to a mass term which is suppressed only by charged lepton masses .",
    "this conclusion was reached by considering one - loop mixing of the magnetic moment and mass operators generated by standard model interactions .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite found that if a magnetic moment arises through a coupling of the neutrinos to the neutral component of the @xmath342 gauge boson , the constraints for @xmath343 and @xmath344 are comparable to present experiment limits , while the constraint on @xmath345 is significantly weaker .",
    "thus , the analysis of ref.@xcite lead to a model independent bound for the transition magnetic moment of majorana neutrinos that is less stringent than present experimental limits .",
    "even more generally it was shown in ref.@xcite that two - loop matching of mass and magnetic moment operators implies stronger constraints than those obtained in@xcite if the scale of the new physics @xmath347 tev . moreover , these constraints apply to a magnetic moment generated by either the hypercharge or @xmath342 gauge boson . in arriving at these conclusions ,",
    "the most general set of operators that contribute at lowest order to the mass and magnetic moments of majorana neutrinos was constructed , and model independent constraints which link the two were obtained .",
    "thus the results of ref.@xcite imply completely model independent naturalness bound that  for @xmath348 tev  is stronger than present experimental limits ( even for the weakest constrained element @xmath345 ) . on the other hand , for sufficiently low values of the scale @xmath26 the known small values of the neutrino masses do not constrain the magnitude of the magnetic moment @xmath314 more than the present experimental limit .",
    "thus , if these conditions are fulfilled , the discovery of @xmath314 might be forthcoming any day .",
    "the above result means that an experimental discovery of a magnetic moment near the present limits would signify that ( i ) neutrinos are majorana fermions and ( ii ) new lepton number violating physics responsible for the generation of @xmath338 arises at a scale @xmath26 which is well below the see - saw scale .",
    "this would have , among other things , implications for the mechanism of the neutrinoless double beta decay and lepton flavor violation as discussed above and in ref.@xcite .",
