    "string - like configurations of classical background fields can polarize the vacuum of quantized matter fields , resulting in the emergence of a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor in spatial regions where the classical field is zero .",
    "a particular example of a string - like configuration is a tube of the magnetic flux lines , that is formed inside a current - carrying long and thin solenoid . but",
    "a more general string - like structure is the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortex @xcite arising as a topological defect in the aftermath of a phase transition with spontaneous breakdown of a continuous symmetry ; the condition of its arising is that the first homotopy group of the group space of the broken symmetry group be nontrivial .",
    "the vortex , apart from its flux , is characterized by nonzero energy distributed along its axis , which in its turn , according to general relativity , is a source of gravity .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that this source makes space outside the vortex to be conical with the deficit angle related to the energy density per unit length of the vortex . since the squared planck length enters as a factor before the stress - energy tensor in the einstein - hilbert equation , the deviations from the minkowskian metric are of the order of squared quotient of the planck length to the correlation length , the latter characterizing the thickness of the vortex . for superconductors this quotient is vanishingly small and effects of conicity are surely negligible @xcite",
    "; hence , the appropriate vortices known as the abrikosov ones are much the same as the solenoidal magnetic vortices ( with one important distinction that the flux of the former is quantized ) .",
    "however , topological defects of the vortex type arise in cosmology under the name of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings with the thickness of the order of the planck length are definitely ruled out by astrophysical observations , and there remains a room for cosmic strings with the thickness which is more than 3.5 orders larger than the planck length , that corresponds to the deficit angles bounded from above by the value of @xmath0 radians ( see @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic strings associated with spontaneous breakdown of global symmetries are called global ( or axionic ) strings ; they are characterized by zero flux .",
    "cosmic strings associated with breakdown of gauge symmetries are called gauge ( or local ) strings ; they are characterized by nonzero flux .",
    "cosmic strings can have various astrophysical effects , in particular , they serve as plausible sources of detectable gravitational waves @xcite , gamma - ray bursts @xcite , high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "although the primary role of cosmic strings in the formation of the large - scale structure of the universe is ruled out by observation of cosmic microwave background by cobe and wmap @xcite , cosmic strings can produce a mechanism for the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the interest to cosmic strings is augmented in the last decade owing to the finding that they emerge at the end of inflation in the framework of superstring models @xcite ( see also reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the details of the cosmic string formation mechanism can be quite different , either fundamental ( super)strings or dirichlet branes are stretched to a macroscopic size , but such structures arize almost inevitably in supergravity models with large extra dimensions @xcite . in this respect",
    "it is appropriate to consider a generalization of a cosmic string in 4-dimensional space - time to a codimension-2 brane in higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "such a brane appears also in the construction of brane - world cosmologies with two extra dimensions ( see @xcite and references therein ) , as well as in the study of quantum aspects of the black hole physics , playing a key role in the formation of chains of kaluza - klein bubbles with black holes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the properties of the vacuum of quantized matter in the background of a codimension-2 brane deserve investigation .",
    "a study of the vacuum polarization effects in the cosmic string background has a long history .",
    "the induced vacuum energy - momentum tensor was considered for the cases of global @xcite and gauge @xcite strings ; in the above the quantized fields were assumed to be massless , whereas the results for the nonvanishing mass were either incomplete or of restricted use , see @xcite .",
    "the effects of nonvanishing mass were exhaustively studied for the case of a negligible deficit angle only @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this respect",
    "it should be noted that the induced vacuum current in the cosmic string background is known both in the massive @xcite and massless @xcite cases .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to obtain the energy - momentum tensor which is induced in the vacuum of the quantized massive scalar field in the cosmic string background . in the next section ,",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor is in general defined with the use of the point - splitting regularization .",
    "green s function in the cosmic string background is obtained in section 3 .",
    "the induced vacuum energy - momentum tensor is obtained in section 4 .",
    "some limiting cases of our result are discussed in section 5 , while the case of the massless quantized scalar field is considered in section 6 .",
    "the results are summarized in section 7 .",
    "we relegate the details of derivation of green s function in the cosmic string background to the appendix .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the quantized charged massive scalar field @xmath1 is given by expression @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) @xmath2_++ \\frac 12\\left[\\nabla^\\nu\\psi^\\dag(x),\\,\\nabla^\\mu\\psi(x)\\right]_+ \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the product of the field operators at the same point @xmath9 is ill - defined , and this leads to the divergence of the formal expression for the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath10 . to regularize this divergence",
    ", one uses the point splitting for the operator product in ( 1 ) : @xmath11,\\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the symbol of chronological ordering in the operator product and @xmath13 the vacuum expectation value of tensor @xmath14 ( 2 ) is well defined .",
    "further , if field operator @xmath15 obeys the klein - gordon equation , then the vacuum expectation value of the chronological operator product in the right - hand side of ( 2 ) is related to green s function of the klein - gordon operator , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "green s function is decomposed as @xmath19 where the first term is singular , whereas the second one is regular in the coincidence limit , @xmath20 ; the divergence of the vacuum expectation value of tensor @xmath14 ( 1 ) is due to the contribution of @xmath21 to tensor @xmath14 ( 2 ) .",
    "thus , the physically meaningful ( renormalized ) vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor is obtained by taking the coincidence limit after the subtraction of the dangerous ( divergent in this limit ) part : @xmath22.\\label{eq7}\\ ] ] this is a quite general scheme which is only necessary but not sufficient to define unambiguously the renormalized value .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , to get the renormalized value in the case of the cosmic string background , it suffices to subtract the appropriate value in the case of the trivial ( minkowski ) background .",
    "as is already mentioned , a cosmic string associated with spontaneous breakdown of a gauge symmetry is characterized by a gauge field with the strength which is directed along the string and is non vanishing inside its core ; the total flux of the strength is denoted in the following by @xmath23 .",
    "space - time outside the string core is the conical space - time where a surface orthogonal to the string axis is isometric to the surface of a cone ; the deficit angle is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant ( squared planck length ) , @xmath26 is the tension ( or energy density per unit length ) of the string , and units @xmath27 are used . in view of the significance of high - dimensional space - times in various aspects",
    "@xcite , we consider a generalization of a cosmic string to a codimension-2 brane in @xmath28-dimensional space - time with squared length element @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the polar coordinates of the conical surface , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are the cartesian coordinates of flat ( @xmath35)-dimensional space , and @xmath36 the transverse size of the cosmic string is neglected ) or diverging ( in the case of the positive deficit angle , @xmath37 ) along a normal to the brane in its vicinity .",
    "thus , parameter @xmath38 in ( 8) can take values in the range @xmath39 . ] , and both the spatial and the bundle curvatures are nonvanishing and singular ( as distributions ) in the codimension-2 brane ( i.e. point in the @xmath40 case , line in the @xmath41 case , surface in the @xmath42 case and @xmath43-hypersurface in the @xmath44 case ) .",
    "thus , the cosmic string background in which the scalar matter field is quantized is characterized by two dimensionless parameters : @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the coupling constant of the scalar to the gauge field forming the string and should not be mistaken for the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "the dalembertian in the cosmic string background takes form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the twodimensional ( transverse ) laplacian and @xmath50 .",
    "green s function in the cosmic string background obeys equations @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the delta - function for the angular variable , @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the set of integer numbers .",
    "it should be noted that , apart from the overall phase factor , green s function is periodic in the value of gauge flux @xmath23 with the period equal to @xmath55 , i.e. it depends on @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the integer part of quantity @xmath58 ( i.e. the integer which is less than or equal to @xmath58 ) .",
