    "dengue is a mosquito - borne infection mostly found in tropical and sub - tropical climates worldwide , mostly in urban and semi - urban areas .",
    "it can cause a severe flu - like illness , and sometimes a potentially lethal complication called dengue haemorrhagic fever .",
    "about 40% of the world s population are now at risk .",
    "the spread of dengue is attributed to expanding geographic distribution of the four dengue viruses and their mosquito vectors , the most important of which is the predominantly urban species _",
    "aedes aegypti_. the life cycle of a mosquito presents four distinct stages : egg , larva , pupa and adult . in the case of _ aedes aegypti _ the first three stages take place in or near water while air is the medium for the adult stage .",
    "the adult stage of the mosquito , in the urban environment , is considered to last an average of eleven days .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section presents a mathematical model of the interaction between human and mosquito populations .",
    "then , the numerical experiments using different strategies for the insecticide administration are reported . in the last section",
    "the conclusions are presented .",
    "considering the work of @xcite , the relationship between humans and mosquitoes are now rather complex , taking into account the model presented in @xcite .",
    "the novelty in this paper is the presence of the control parameter related to adult mosquito insecticide @xcite .",
    "the notation used in our mathematical model includes four epidemiological states for humans ( index @xmath0 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "the numerical tests conclude that the best strategy for the infected reduction is the weekly administration , however it is also the most expensive one ( insecticide cost ) .",
    "the best result obtained is between 11 and 12 days , with the insecticide amount in the closed interval from 7 to 8 , confirming the amount for @xmath1 in @xcite .",
    "the 11 or 12 days between applications can be directly related to the span of adult stage for the mosquitoes , an average of eleven days in an urban environment .    in this work the insecticide administration time was considered continuous in each day ( 24 hours per day ) . as a future work ,",
    "an optimization problem will be formulated and solved in order to find the best plan in terms of periodicity and duration ( limited number of hours per day ) .",
    "the plan must consider the advantages to apply the insecticide only during the night .",
