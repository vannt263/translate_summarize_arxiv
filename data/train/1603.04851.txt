    "the cause of the accelerated cosmic expansion @xcite remains elusive .",
    "one possibility is quintessence , in which the acceleration is driven by the potential energy of a scalar field displaced from the minimum of its potential .",
    "the idea that late - time acceleration could be connected to a new fundamental scalar was suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) and developed into viable models in refs .",
    "alternative gravity solutions to cosmic acceleration or models based upon large extra dimensions also generally require some parameter to be tuned to be extremely small @xcite .",
    "string landscape @xcite and/or anthropic arguments @xcite explain the small value of the cosmological constant by supposing a universe with a cosmological constant of this value just happens to be the one , of @xmath14 , that allows intelligent observers .",
    "quintessence models do not generically address the `` why now ? ''",
    "i.e. , why the universe transitions from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion only fairly recently , after the universe has cooled 30 orders of magnitude below the planck temperature .",
    "there are so called  tracker models , \" @xcite in which the functional form of the quintessence potential causes its energy density to scale as the dominant component until late times , when its equation - of - state parameter @xmath15 and it comes to dominate the cosmic expansion and drive late - time acceleration .",
    "these models obviate the need for finely tuned initial conditions but still require a finely tuned overall energy scale for quintessence @xcite .",
    "other quintessence models typically require a potential that is extremely flat .",
    "this latter problem may be solved  @xcite if the quintessence field is an axion - like field , in which case the shift symmetry of the axion potential protects the extraordinary flatness required of the quintessence potential .",
    "this solution , though , still requires either that the axion decay constant have a super - planckian value , something that violates the gravity - as - the - weakest force conjecture @xcite , or that the initial axion misalignment angle is extremely close to the value @xmath3 that maximizes the potential .",
    "this latter option is considered unappealing as it replaces the fine - tuning of a cosmological constant with the fine tuning of some other parameter .",
    "the hypothesis that quintessence is an axion - like field also requires that the dark - energy density today must still be put in by hand .    in recent work @xcite ,",
    "several of us suggested that some of the remaining problems with axion - like quintessence may be addressed in the string axiverse @xcite .",
    "string theories may lead to a family of @xmath16 axion - like fields with masses that span a huge number of decades @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a scenario was proposed in which these axions have masses that are distributed roughly evenly per decade of axion mass . in such models",
    ", ultralight axions can furnish dark matter _ and _ dark energy candidates .",
    "the theoretical motivation for and phenomenology of ultralight axions is reviewed at length in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this scenario , in each decade of the cosmic expansion , one of these axions becomes dynamical and has some small chance to drive an accelerated expansion .",
    "this chance is determined by the initial value , assumed to be selected at random , of the axion misalignment angle .",
    "it was shown that with reasonable parameter selections , there is a one in @xmath17100 chance that the universe will expand by @xmath18 decades in scale factor before it undergoes accelerated expansion .",
    "the scenario thus explains quintessence in terms of an axion - like field with dimensionless parameters that never differ from unity by more than an order of magnitude and also addresses the `` why now ? ''",
    "problem .",
    "while the scenario may lead to a variety of observational consequences , the most basic prediction is that dark energy is an axion - like quintessence field with a decay constant very close to , but just below , the planck mass .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the observational consequences of this type of quintessence theory , to impose constraints to the parameter space from current measurements , and to forecast the sensitivity of future measurements to the remaining regions of the model parameter space .",
    "it is found that current cosmic microwave background measurements reduce the allowed parameter space to a fraction @xmath10 of the prior volume , while future measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale by galaxy surveys could distinguish all but a fraction of @xmath12 of the parameter - space volume ( allowed by simple priors ) from the @xmath13cdm model .",
    "on the other hand , it is found that if constraints are projected onto the two - dimensional space of axion mass @xmath1 and initial misalignment angle @xmath4 , the sensitivity of future experiments improves only modestly upon current constraints , assuming that the correct underlying dark - energy model is in fact the fiducial @xmath13cdm scenario .",

    "<S> inspired by the string axiverse idea , it has been suggested that the recent transition from decelerated to accelerated cosmic expansion is driven by an axion - like quintessence field with a sub - planckian decay constant . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario requires that the axion field be rather near the maximum of its potential , but is less finely tuned than other explanations of cosmic acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the model is parametrized by an axion decay constant @xmath0 , the axion mass @xmath1 , and an initial misalignment angle @xmath2 which is close to @xmath3 . in order to determine the @xmath1 and @xmath4 values consistent with observations , </S>",
    "<S> these parameters are mapped onto observables : the hubble parameter @xmath5 at an angular diameter distance @xmath6 to redshift @xmath7 , as well as the angular sound horizon of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale at @xmath8 by the boss survey and planck measurements of cmb temperature anisotropies are then used to probe the @xmath9 parameter space . with current data , </S>",
    "<S> cmb constraints are the most powerful , allowing a fraction of only @xmath10 of the parameter - space volume . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the bao scale made using the spherex or ska experiments could go further , observationally distinguishing all but @xmath11 or @xmath12 of the parameter - space volume ( allowed by simple priors ) from the @xmath13cdm model . </S>"
