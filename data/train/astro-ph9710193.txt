    "our model is most briefly described as kind of a synthesis of a modified tinsley model for the chemical evolution ( sn@xmath1ia treated  la matteuchi ) and a bruzual  like model for the spectral evolution of the stellar population .",
    "models have been improved to be * chemically consistent * , i.e. we use evolutionary tracks , yields , lifetimes and remnant masses for the metallicity calculated at the time of birth for respective stars .",
    "metallicity dependent stellar yields and remnant masses for massive stars ( @xmath2 ) are taken from weaver & woosley@xcite . for lower mass stars data from van den hoek & groenewegen@xcite are incorporated .",
    "updated sn@xmath1ia contributions are taken from nomoto et al.@xcite . adopting any cosmological model ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and epoch of galaxy formation ( ) we obtain redshift dependent quantities ( ism abundances , spectra , etc . ) which can be compared to observations .",

    "the chemically consistent sd model fits the observational data better than the model calculated with solar abundances !",
    "the rough agreement of element abundances from our models with those for high redshift galaxies ( dla systems at @xmath6 ) is an important result , because the sfr we use has been derived from comparison with photometric data of low redshift galaxies ( @xmath7 ) .",
