    "the large scale structure of the universe is also affected by non - gaussianities that may be detected by looking at the bispectrum or the trispectrum of galaxy distribution .",
    "the abundance of galaxy clusters , that depends on the tails of the density probability distribution , is also sensitive to any deviation from gaussianity .",
    "non - gaussianity has a direct impact on the clustering of dark matter halos by changing their mass and correlation function ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "+ a common way to parameterize primordial non - gaussianities is to introduce a quadratic correction to the potential @xcite@xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the primordial potential and @xmath17 is a gaussian random field . in this case",
    "the non - gaussianity is a local type correction whose amplitude is given by @xmath0 .",

    "we follow the methodology of @xcite and constrain @xmath0 by looking at the scale dependence of the bias in current galaxy surveys data .",
    "we implement the calculation of galaxy and halo power spectrum using the halo - model ( see @xcite and section [ halomodel ] ) and we include in it the non - gaussian scale - dependent correction to the bias .",
    "we then place constraints on @xmath0 by comparing this model to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite galaxy power spectrum data @xcite and to the halo power spectrum data obtained from the luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) sample @xcite .",
    "we include in the analysis the wmap-7 years cosmic microwave background anisotropy data @xcite .",

    "we finally forecast the power of future galaxy surveys in constraining non gaussianity by generating mock data for galaxy power spectrum using specifications of euclid @xcite survey combined with mock data from planck @xcite satellite and showing in section [ forecasts ] that the combination of data from these experiments could reach the precision required to detect even small non - gaussianities .",
    "in the halo model scenario ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) all matter is contained in halos and , as a consequence , the abundance of halos , their spatial distribution and their internal density profiles are closely connected to the initial dark matter fluctuation field . under the assumption that galaxies are formed in these halos of dark matter",
    "@xcite is then possible to use the halo model to calculate the statistical properties of distribution of galaxies . to this aim",
    ", the basic quantity is the halo occupation distribution ( hod , see @xcite ) that encodes the information on how galaxies populate dark matter halos as a function of halo - mass .",
    "the statistical information is contained in the two - point correlation function of galaxies or equivalently its fourier transform , the galaxy power spectrum .",

    "we choose three fiducial models , @xmath82 .",
    "remember that in our approach we are using only the information of large scale galaxy clustering to constrain non - gaussianity , while we use cmb measurements only to constrain other cosmological parameters and hence to break degeneracies .",
    "+ results for our forecast on @xmath0 are shown in table [ tabfor ] .",
    "as one can see the combination of accurate galaxy power spectrum measurements , attainable with a survey like euclid and planck cmb measurements could reach the sensitivity required to detect an even small non - gaussianity , such as @xmath83 or @xmath84 , with a confidence level of at least @xmath8 .",
    "we note that this results is in agreement with other forecast for future galaxy surveys ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "very small non - gaussianities ( @xmath85 ) seem instead rather difficult to detect , mainly due to degeneracies with other parameters .",
    "nevertheless in @xcite it has also been shown that in more complicated models ( allowing variation of neutrino mass , running of spectral index , dark energy equation of state and relativistic degrees of freedom ) constraints on @xmath0 may deteriorate up to @xmath86 .",
    "before concluding we discuss the possible systematics introduced by the assumptions we made or , more generally , by the theoretical uncertainties of the model .",
    "+ first , we have seen that the value of @xmath87 that appear in the ( [ correction ] ) may have a value in the range @xmath88 .",
    "we have assumed @xmath89 since we are using luminous red galaxies that are old galaxies at the center of halos .",
    "this is a common assumption for this kind of analysis ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "anyway we find that even assuming @xmath90 the differences in the power spectrum with respect to the case @xmath89 are very small .",
    "using @xmath90 we find only a slight variation in the @xmath91 with respect to @xmath89 for the best fit model : @xmath92 .",
    "the reason for this is that actual data constrain scales @xmath93 where the exact value of @xmath87 is less relevant .",
    "nevertheless for future low-@xmath23 data it may be necessary a more precise modeling of the ( [ correction ] ) .",
    "+ a second assumption we made is that the density profile of the halos is described by the nfw profile .",
    "although the exact shape of the profiles in the halos is still uncertain , this profile has been tested against several numerical simulations and it turned out to be a good approximation @xcite .",
    "moreover , again , the information on @xmath0 is coming from @xmath94 where the density profile is constant in fourier space .",
    "+ an important point is the comparison between the results from the lrg power spectrum of @xcite and the halo power spectrum from @xcite .",
    "the first dataset provides a galaxy power spectrum while the second a halo density field that does nt require any assumption about the halo occupation number . in @xcite",
    "there is a large discussion on the differences between these two dataset and we refer the reader to this work for a complete discussion . here",
    "we remark that the main differences are due to the heavy finger of gods compression algorithm used in @xcite to obtain the matter power spectrum .",
    "this process may cause transfer of power from a scale to another , causing consistent deviations ( up to @xmath95 on @xmath96 ) between the reconstructed halo density field and the matter power spectrum @xcite . for the dr7 halo power spectrum instead ,",
    "the halo density field is reconstructed before the computation of the power spectrum ( see section 2.2 in @xcite ) and the deviations between the two are smaller than @xmath97 . also the modeling of the theoretical halo power spectrum and of the galaxy power spectrum is different .",
    "the model of @xcite is calibrated on n - body simulations and mock data - sets made especially for this lrg sample .",
    "moreover the authors of @xcite imposed priors on the nuisance parameters of the model based on n - body simulations .",
    "for the galaxy power spectrum of @xcite it was used the @xmath98-model @xcite for the non linear part of the power spectrum , marginalizing over @xmath98 with weak priors .",
    "all these differences necessarily reflects on the cosmological parameters estimation , including @xmath0 .",
    "the comparison between results of the two datasets is made in section 6.1 of @xcite .",
    "significant differences are found on some cosmological parameters from the two lrg datasets only ( i.e. not including cmb ) of the two releases : in particular the @xmath99 values ( that enters also in the ( [ correction ] ) ) differ of almost 2@xmath100 between the two surveys .",
    "+ in our work , to fit the dr7 data we are only introducing the bias scale dependent correction to the model of @xcite , in order to be as much as possible consistent with the data compression algorithm of this lrg catalogue .",
    "we ascribe the differences between the results of section [ galaxydata ] and [ halodata ] to the significant differences of the data compression process , as noted also in @xcite .",
    "+ a last issue concern the modeling of power spectra on non - linear scales . for dr7 data , the authors of @xcite normalize the final halo power spectrum using mock catalogues to account for the small offset between the n - body and halofit results .",
    "+ concerning the galaxy power spectrum we used to fit data from @xcite , the @xmath101 we are using in relation ( [ 2halo ] ) is the linear matter power spectrum , which is well known . the galaxy power spectrum is calculated through the halo - model itself . the @xmath3-parameters model we are using showed a good agreement with hydrodynamical and n - body simulations and semi - analytic models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , we are marginalizing over the @xmath3 free parameters that account for the uncertainties of the model , so that our analysis is rather conservative . + in the forecast section we model the galaxy power spectrum relying on the same assumption made above ( @xmath89 for galaxies and nfw profiles ) and using the same hod modeling .",
    "our results show the potential of a survey like euclid to detect even small non gaussianities and are in good agreement with forecast done for the same survey and for a similar modeling of the scale dependent bias @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however that the analysis of real data from these future surveys will probably require a more accurate modeling of the galaxy power spectrum and of the scale dependent correction in order to not bias the estimated value of the cosmological parameters .",
    "we place new constraints on the local type non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 by looking at the scale dependence of the halo bias ( at small wave vectors ) in the recent galaxy and halo power spectra measurements from lrg sample of the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "we fit 2006 sdss power spectra data with an halo model consisting of 5 parameters plus 7 cosmological paramers and @xmath0 .",
    "our large parameter space and the the restriction of the dataset to relatively small scales ( @xmath102 ) leads to a weak constraint : @xmath7 at @xmath8 c.l .. we show and discuss degeneracies with halo model parameters . when including both type ia supernovae and @xmath103 data the @xmath104 error on @xmath0 is reduced of about @xmath105 .",
    "we use also 2009 halo power spectra data obtained from sdss lrg sample finding a slightly better constraint @xmath13 at @xmath8 c.l . , again limited by the fact that the dataset does not extend below @xmath106 .",
    "we also forecast the constraints obtainable from datasets of a survey like euclid when combined with planck cmb data , finding that these surveys could reach the accuracy required to detect even small non - gaussianities as @xmath83 , thus confirming the power of this method .",
    "finally we discuss the possible systematics and theoretical uncertainties that may affect the results .",
