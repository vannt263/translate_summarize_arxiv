    "chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) has been an active research field in particle physics for over forty years since nambu [ 1 ] used this idea to generate fermion mass in a four - fermion model .",
    "one fascinating characteristic of csb is that it can generate fermion mass via the fermion - antifermion condensation mediated by strong gauge field without introducing additional higgs particles which till now have not been found .",
    "the most conclusive evidence for the existence of csb is provided by the phenomenology of strong interaction , and csb is widely believed to account for the pions . however , despite the vast amount of theoretical work on csb , till now it is not clear whether it can be derived from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , primarily due to the complex structure of the su(3 ) gauge field .",
    "to gain valuable insight of csb before we can treat it completely , it is very suggestive to study some model that is similar to qcd while is simpler than it .",
    "three - dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath0 ) is just such a model , and it has attracted intense investigations [ 2 - 9 ] in the past twenty years .",
    "qed@xmath0 was shown to exhibit csb [ 5 - 9 ] and confinement [ 9 ] , while at the same it is simple enough to be treated with high accuracy .",
    "besides , it has been used to model the physics of many planar condensed matter systems such as high temperature superconductors [ 10 - 18 ] and fractional quantum hall systems [ 19 ] .",
    "the breakthrough in the research of csb in qed@xmath0 was brought by a paper of appelquist @xmath4 @xmath5 [ 5 ] who found that csb occurs when the flavor of massless fermions is less than a critical number @xmath6 .",
    "they arrived at this conclusion by analytically and numerically solving the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equation of the fermion self - energy to the lowest order of @xmath7 expansion .",
    "later , extensive analytical and numerical investigations [ 6 - 8 ] showed that the nature of csb in qed@xmath0 remain the same after including higher order corrections to the ds equation .",
    "the above result holds when the gauge boson is massless and but is expected to change when the gauge boson has a finite mass .",
    "csb is a low - energy phenomenon because ( 2 + 1)-dimensional u(1 ) gauge field theory is asymptotically free [ 20 ] and only in the infrared region the gauge interaction is strong enough to cause fermion condensation .",
    "this requires the fermions be apart from each other .",
    "however , when the gauge boson has a finite mass it can not mediate a long - range interaction . intuitively , a finite gauge boson mass is repulsive to csb which is achieved by the formation of fermion - anti - fermion pairs .",
    "thus it is very interesting to study whether csb can occur in the presence of a finite gauge boson mass .",
    "csb is believed to be a nonperturbative phenomenon and hence calculations based on perturbative expansions are incapable of establishing its existence .",
    "we will study csb by means of solving the nonlinear ds equation for the fermion self - energy . assuming that @xmath8 based on naive @xmath7 expansion , we get a single integral equation of the gap function @xmath9 .",
    "csb is signalled by the appearance of a squarely integrable nontrivial solution . to solve the ds equation",
    ", we will use bifurcation theory and parameter imbedding method , which not only avoids the convergency problem that usually appears in iteration method but also can help us distinguish the different bifurcations points . after solving the ds equation , we find that the massless fermions can acquire a finite dynamically generated mass when the gauge boson mass @xmath10 is smaller than a critical value @xmath11 .",
    "to testify the robustness of our result against the effect of @xmath12 , we will work in a non - local gauge in which @xmath13 and the vertex function can be replaced by the gamma matrices safely .",
    "we will show that when the wave function renormalization @xmath14 is included , the result we derive in the landau gauge remains qualitatively unchanged .",
    "our study on the influence of gauge boson mass on the fate of csb not only is of theoretical interests but can be used to understand important physical phenomena .",
    "actually , starting from the concept of spin - charge separation proposed by anderson [ 21 ] , the effective low energy theory of high temperature superconductors is a u(1 ) gauge theory [ 10 - 13 ] .",
    "superconductivity is achieved when the charge carrying holons bose condensate into a macroscopic quantum state , which generate a finite mass to the gauge boson via anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "the low energy spin fluctuations are captured by the two - component fermions , which are originally massless since they are excited from the @xmath15-wave gap nodes [ 11 ] . on the other hand",
    ", csb is known to correspond to the long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order , which can be seen from the behavior of af spin correlation function at low momentum .",
    "if we use csb to describe the af order and use the gauge boson mass to describe the superconducting ( sc ) order , our result then leads to a competition between the long - range af order and the long - range sc order , which is one of the most fundamental issues in modern condensed matter physics . as a compromise of this competition , when the mass of gauge boson is less than its critical value @xmath16 but is finite",
    "there is a coexistence of these two orders in the bulk superconductors .",
    "if the u(1 ) gauge field is compact in the meaning that the vector potential has a periodicity , then it acquires a finite mass via the instanton effect .",
    "furthermore , permanent confinement of static charges is present when the instanton effect is important .",
    "the influence of additional matter fields , especially massless fermions , on the permanent confinement is an unsolved problem .",
    "the relation between csb and the gauge boson mass obtained in this paper is very helpful in studying the confinement to deconfinement phase transition driven by the couling of massless fermions .",
    "the physical applications of csb in the presence of a gauge boson mass to high temperature superconductors have been reported in a letter [ 16 ] . in this paper , we provide the related field theoretical technique in details . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the ds equation in the presence of a finite mass of the gauge boson in the landau gauge .",
    "we then choose to solve the nonlinear ds equation by means of bifurcation theory and parameter imbedding method .",
    "iii is devoted to the elementary knowledge of bifurcation theory that will be used in this paper and the detailed calculation steps of parameter imbedding method . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider the higher order corrections to the wave function renormalization and show that these corrections do not change our result noticeably . in sec.v , we give a thorough discussion of the competing orders in high temperature superconductors from a field theoretical point of view . in particular , we emphasize the necessity for nonperturbative effect in getting an af spin correlation that is consistent with experiments . in sec.vi",
    ", we discuss the instanton effect on csb in compact qed@xmath0 .",
    "the calculation of af spin correlation function in the csb phase is given in the appendix .",
    "the three - dimentional u(1 ) gauge theory of massless fermions is @xmath17 where the fermi field @xmath18 is a @xmath19 spinor .",
    "the @xmath20 @xmath21 matrices obey the algebra , @xmath22 .",
    "the full fermion propagator is @xmath23 where @xmath12 is the wave - function renormalization and @xmath24 the fermion self - energy .",
    "the ds equation for the full fermion propagator in momentum space is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the full vertex function and @xmath27 is the full photon propagator .",
    "@xmath28 is the bare propagator of the massless fermions .",
    "substituting the propagator ( 2 ) into eq.(3 ) and taking trace on both sides , we obtain the equation for @xmath24 @xmath29 multiplying both sides of eq.(3 ) by @xmath30 and then taking trace on both sides , we obtain the equation for @xmath12 @xmath31    if the ds equation for @xmath24 has only vanishing solutions , the fermions remain massless and the lagrangian ( 1 ) respects the chiral symmetries @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 two @xmath35 matrices that anticommute with @xmath21 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "if the ds equation for @xmath24 develops a squarely integrable nontrivial solution [ 23 - 25 ] , then the originally massless fermions acquire a finite dynamically generated mass which breaks the chiral symmetries .",
    "we starts from a general gauge boson propagator @xmath37 with @xmath38+\\xi^{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a gauge - fixing parameter that depends on 3-momentum and @xmath40 is the mass of the gauge boson .",
    "we use @xmath41 to denote the gauge boson momentum , and we have @xmath42 . @xmath43 is the vacuum polarization of the gauge boson , which was included initially to overcome the infrared divergence .",
    "if we includ only the one - loop diagrams for massless fermions , we can write the vacuum polarization as @xmath44 then we have @xmath45 with @xmath46 since at low momentum @xmath47 [ 5 ] .    as the lowest - order approximation",
    ", we neglect the wave function renormalization @xmath12 and adopt a massive gauge boson propagator in the landau gauge ( @xmath48 ) as follows @xmath49 further , we use the bare vertex , i.e. , @xmath50 , which is usally called quenched planar approximation .",
    "then the ds equation becomes @xmath51 now we can insert the propagator ( 11 ) into the ds equation ( 11 ) , then @xmath52 where @xmath53 . after performing the integration with respect to @xmath54 and introducing an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath55 we finally arrive at the following ds equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 serves as an effective coupling constant .",
    "if we do not introduce an ultraviolet cutoff ( @xmath58 ) , the critical behavior of eq.(14 ) is completely independent of @xmath59 , as can be easily seen by making the scale transformation , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we can destroy this scale invariance by introducing an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath55 .",
    "before we go into the techniques of dealing with the ds equation , we would like to discuss one subtle issue .",
    "if the ds equation has only trivial solutions , the fermions remain massless and the chiral symmetries are not broken .",
    "however , @xmath63 all nontrivial solutions lead to csb .",
    "it is well known that the breaking of a chiral symmetry is always accompanied by a goldstone boson , which is a pseudoscalar bound state composed of a fermion and an antifermion .",
    "if csb happens , there should be a nontrivial solution for the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation of this bound state .",
    "in addition , the bound state wave function must satisfy a normalization condition , which can be converted to a sufficient and necessary condition [ 23 - 25 ] for the nontrivial solutions of the ds equation to signal csb .",
    "it gives a constraint on the form of @xmath64 as follows [ 25 ] @xmath65 it is easy to see that in order to satisfy this condition @xmath66 must damp more rapidly than @xmath67 in the ultraviolet region ( @xmath68 )",
    ". the mass function obtained by appelquist @xmath4 @xmath5 [ 4 ] satisfies this condition and hence the nontrivial solutions of the ds equation in qed@xmath0 corresponds to true csb solutions [ 25 ] . on the other hand , when an ultraviolet cutoff is introduced , the solution @xmath24 automatically satisfies the squarely integrable condition .",
    "we should emphasize that although the nontrivial solutions with an ultraviolet cutoff all satisfy such a condition , only those solutions that satisfy this condition in the continuum limit is taken are physically sensible . in the case of four - dimensional qed , although the nontrivial solutions with explicit ultraviolet cutoff are squarely integrable they do not satisfy the squarely integrable condition when we take the continuum limit [ 23,24 ]",
    ". therefore , the csb solutions obtained in quenched planar qed@xmath69 [ 26 ] are not physically meaningful solutions because they are not squarely integrable in the continuum limit , or in other words the associated bound state wave functions can not be normalized . in qed@xmath0 , it was found that @xmath64 behaves like @xmath70 at @xmath68 , which surely satisfies the condition .",
    "since the nontrivial solutions in qed@xmath0 are true csb solutions , we can safely introduce an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath55 without bringing unphysical nontrivial solutions .",
    "theoretical analysis implies that the critical fermion number @xmath6 of eq.(4 ) should depend on @xmath71 . to determine",
    "when csb occurs , the ds equation should be solved implicitly .",
    "the ds equation is an nonlinear integral equation and hence is very hard to investigate .",
    "however , based on general bifurcation theory and parameter imbedding method , we can find the critical fermion number and the mass function exactly .",
    "the detailed programe of calculations is the topic of the next section . in the rest of this section ,",
    "we discuss some qualitative properties extracted from the ds euqation ( 14 ) .",
    "when the gauge boson has a very large mass , for example @xmath72 , then the ds equation becomes @xmath73 from the momentum dependence of the mass function of fermions , we know that actually it is a constant in this limit .",
    "therefore , the ds integral equation simplifies to a algebraic equation @xmath74 this equation has no solutions , hence a large enough mass of gauge boson prevents the occurrence of csb .",
    "we now consider another limit , i.e. , when the gauge boson mass is very small . in this limit , the last term in the kernel of ( 14 )",
    "can be dropped safely , leaving a ds equation that is the same as the one studied by appelquist @xmath4 @xmath5 [ 5 ] .",
    "then a very small gauge boson mass actually does not affect the critical behavior of qed@xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood if it happens that the critical fermion number @xmath75 decreases when the gauge boson mass @xmath1 increases and it finally approaches zero for very large @xmath1 .",
    "the main purpose of our work is to use qed@xmath0 to model condensed matter systems where the physical fermion number is @xmath76 , which comes from the two components of the spin .",
    "based on the tendency of the critical fermion number in the presence of a finite gauge boson mass , it is quite reasonable to hypothesize that there is a critical value for the gauge boson mass @xmath2 above which csb is inhibited . to make sure that it is actually the case , we should solve the ds equation and find the critical coupling constant @xmath77 at which the ds equation starts to have nontrivial solutions .",
    "the equation ( 14 ) is a hammerstein type nonlinear integral equation . it does not satisfy the conditions of the global eigenfunction theory of nonlinear functional analysis , so its global solutions can not be obtained directly . however , the local bifurcation theory [ 27 ] can help us to find its complete solutions by first obtaining a local solution near a bifurcation point and then extending its region of validity step by step .",
    "this program is most easily achieved by parameter imbedding method [ 28 - 30 ] , which has proved to be a powerful method in studying integral equations .    in order to obtain the bifurcation points we need only to find the eigenvalues of the associated frchet derivative of the nonlinear ds equation [ 28,29 ] .",
    "those eigenvalues that have odd multiplicity are the bifurcation points . making frchet derivative of the nonlinear equation ( 14 )",
    ", we have the following linearized equation @xmath78 with the kernel @xmath79 where for calculational convenience we made the transformation @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue @xmath77 of this equation is just the bifurcation point from which a nontrivial solution of the ds equation ( 14 ) branches off . the complex kernel @xmath83 in the linearized equation ( 18 ) makes it very difficult to find an analytical solution .",
    "we now would like to use parameter imbedding method [ 28,29 ] to solve ( 18 ) numerically . to do this , we first analytically continue it in the complex plane of @xmath84 , correspondingly @xmath24 also becomes a complex function . it can be shown that @xmath85 here we use @xmath86 to denote @xmath87 , and @xmath88 to denote @xmath89 . from the fredholm integral equation theory we know that there exists a resolvent function for the kernel @xmath90 @xmath91 where the functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 are analytic with respect to @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath94 , we do not have bifurcations points .",
    "the values of @xmath84 at which @xmath95 are the bifurcation points . according to the parameter imbedding method , the functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 are related by the differential - integral equations @xmath96 @xmath97,\\ ] ] with the initial conditions @xmath98 @xmath99 one remarkable advantage of parameter imbedding method is to convert the integral equations with variables @xmath86 and @xmath88 to a set of equations in the variable @xmath84 .",
    "correspondingly , the boundary conditions in original equations are replaced by two initial conditions , which are easier to treat in performing numerical calculations .",
    "now , the functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be readily obtained by integrating numerically with respect to @xmath84 .",
    "we now should choose an appropriate contour @xmath100 in the complex @xmath84-plane which contains the minimum @xmath84 on the real axis at which @xmath101 .",
    "the number of zero eigenvalues of the linearized equation ( 18 ) inside the contour @xmath100 is ( i.e. , the zeroes of the function @xmath102 ) @xmath103 we can obtain the eigenvalues by solving the equations @xmath104 with @xmath105 . for the present purpose , we only need to know the first bifurcation point , hence we let @xmath106 .    for @xmath107 ,",
    "the ds equation has nontrivial solutions and the massless fermions become massive . the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath55 is provided by the lattice constant and hence is kept fixed .",
    "we can obtain the relation of @xmath6 and @xmath59 by calculating the critical coupling @xmath108 for different values of @xmath71 .",
    "our numerical result is presented in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the critical fermion number @xmath75 is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath71 . for small @xmath109 ,",
    "@xmath6 is smaller than physical number 2 ; so csb does not occur .",
    "when @xmath71 increases , the critical number @xmath6 increases accordingly and finally becomes larger than 2 at about @xmath110 .",
    "then we see that there is a critical value of the gauge boson mass @xmath111 , below which a finite mass is generated for massless fermions while beyond which csb is suppressed .",
    "in the last two sections , we have investigated the ds equation in the landau gauge after assuming that @xmath8 to simplify calculations .",
    "although this assumption is qualitatively correct , higher order corrections from the wave function renormalization @xmath12 will alter the critical fermion number @xmath6 quantitatively .",
    "however , including @xmath12 makes the ds equations very complicated and we should solve consistently two couples of nonlinear integral equations . furthermore , according to the ward - takahashi identity , we can not choose @xmath112 as the vertex function in the presence of wave function renormalization @xmath12 .",
    "at present , there is no theoretical guidance in determining the vertex function @xmath113 , and hence one can not give a guarantee of the legitimacy of a specific choice of vertex function . here , to simply calculations and partly overcome the embarrassment in choosing the vertex function , we introduce a so - called nonlocal gauge [ 31 - 34 ] in which the wave function renormalization @xmath114 and the vertex function can be chosen as @xmath115 with @xmath116 a function of the fermion momentum @xmath87 , @xmath89 .",
    "the nonlocal gauge is obtained by solving a differential equation . in this gauge",
    ", we need only to investigate a single equation for @xmath117 in studying the chiral phase transition .",
    "let us go back to the general massive gauge boson propagator ( 6 ) .",
    "if we consider quenched planar approximation of qed@xmath0 , i.e. , taking @xmath118 , then the wave function renormalization @xmath119 in the landau gauge .",
    "this result is well - known to be exact in qed of dimensions higher than @xmath76 . in the case of qed@xmath0",
    ", the one - loop vacuum polarization is usually introduced explicitly to overcome the severe infrared divergence . in the presence of @xmath120 ,",
    "wave function renormalization @xmath12 does not equal to identity .",
    "it should be obtained by solving two consistent integral equations of @xmath12 and @xmath117 . however , taking advantage of the gauge degrees of freedom of the system , we can simplify the ds equations by choosing an appropriate gauge . in particular ,",
    "if we could obtain a gauge parameter @xmath39 that satisfies the following equation [ 34 ] @xmath121 then we find a gauge in which @xmath122 .",
    "further , according to the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identity , the vertex function can be chosen as [ 34 ] @xmath123 now the formidable task to solve a pair of integral equations for the wave function renormalization @xmath12 and the mass function @xmath24 is simplified to solve a single equation of @xmath24 @xmath124d_{t}(q^{2}).\\ ] ]    from @xmath125 and eq.(29 ) , the integral upon @xmath54 can be calculated @xmath126 then we obtain a nonlocal gauge parameter @xmath127",
    "substituting this @xmath39 into the ds equation ( 31 ) , after angular integration we have @xmath128 in deriving this result , we have used the following formula @xmath129    after integrating ( 34 ) , we have @xmath130 with @xmath131 here , @xmath57 is the effective coupling constant . at the first glance ,",
    "both the third and fourth terms of @xmath132 have singular behaviors like @xmath133 which would cause divergence if @xmath134 approaches @xmath135 .",
    "however , when @xmath136 , we can make the expansion @xmath137 thus the singular terms are exactly cancelled . the same step can be used to show that the singular term @xmath138 can also be cancelled exactly .",
    "therefore , the kernel @xmath132 is a smooth function on the whole integration region .    making frchet derivative of the nonlinear equation ( 35 ) , we obtain the linearized equation @xmath139 with @xmath140 where for calculational convenience we made the transformation @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath141 .    using the steps we presented in the last section",
    ", we can solve the linearized equation ( 39 ) to obtain the relation between the critical fermion number @xmath6 and the mass @xmath1 of the gauge boson mass .",
    "the numerical result is presented in fig.(2 ) , from which we know that the critical value of the gauge boson mass is about @xmath142 .",
    "although there is a significant change in the critical value @xmath2 , the result we obtained in the landau gauge remains qualitatively correct .",
    "understanding the competing orders in high temperature cuprate superconductors is one of the most important issues in condensed matter physics . in the presence of competing orders , one order parameter prevails",
    "when other orders are suppressed by some external variables . at half - filling , the cuprate superconductor is a mott insulator with long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order .",
    "when holes are dopped into the cu - o planes , the material becomes a superconductor at low temperatures and the long - range af order disappears .",
    "hence there is a competition between the af order and the sc order , and as a result of this competition the af order dominates at zero and low doping while the sc order dominates at higher doping .",
    "however , even at higher doping the af order also has a chance to appear locally where the superconductivity is suppressed by strong external magnetic fields .",
    "recently , elaborate neutron scattering [ 35 ] and scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) [ 36 ] experiments found that the af correlation is significantly enhanced in regions surrounding the vortex cores . in this paper",
    ", we will use spin - charge separation and csb to understand the competing orders .",
    "it has been shown that [ 10 - 13 ] lagrangian ( 1 ) is the effective low energy theory of undoped cuprates which has only fermionic excitations because of the presence of a large charge gap . in underdoped cuprates ,",
    "the electrons fractionalize into spin carrying spinons and charge carrying holons .",
    "it has been pointed out [ 15,16 ] that the physics of underdoped cuprates is captured by an effective u(1 ) gauge theory of massless fermions and charged scalar fields @xmath143 here @xmath144 is a doublet of scalar fields representing the holons [ 15 ] .",
    "@xmath145 and generally @xmath146 as a result of the velocity anisotropy ; however , for simplicity we can let @xmath147 .",
    "since the spin and charge degrees of freedom are assumed to be separated , there is no yukawa - type coupling between the fermion field and the scalar field . in the superconducting state ,",
    "the boson @xmath148 acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value , i.e. , @xmath149 .",
    "this nonzero @xmath150 spontaneously breaks gauge symmetry of the theory and the gauge boson acquires a finite mass @xmath1 via anderson - higgs mechanism .    in the context of high temperature superconductors the u(1 ) gauge field",
    "is introduced as a lagrangian multiplier to impose local no - double occupancy constraint .",
    "it has no kinetic term @xmath151 and its dynamics is obtained by integrating out the matter fields . if we only include the one - loop diagram in the vacuum polarization , we get @xmath152 . as we have showed previously , the effect of additional scalar doublet is to shift @xmath153 in the gauge boson vacuum polarization @xmath43 to @xmath154 , i.e. , @xmath155 .",
    "then the propagator for the gauge boson is @xmath156 from the corresponding ds equation in the non - local gauge obtained above , we found a critical gauge boson mass at @xmath157 . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "csb occurs ; while for @xmath3 , csb is suppressed .",
    "we now would like to discuss the long - range behavior of the af correlation function .",
    "the af spin correlation is defined as @xmath158 , \\]]where @xmath159 is the fermion propagator .",
    "if the fermions are massless , then @xmath160and we have @xmath161at @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and the af correlation is heavily lost .",
    "this is not a surprising result since our starting point is the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) picture proposed by anderson [ 21 ] , which is just a liquid of spin singlets and hence it has only short range af correlation .",
    "this is not a satisfying situation because a long - range nel order was observed in experiments shortly after the discovery of cuprate superconductors .",
    "however , even if we starts from an rvb ground state , it is still possible to obtain the long - range af correlation because of the strong correlation nature of the mott insulators . the strong correlation is reflected in the fact that double occupancy on a single lattice is completely inhibited due to the strong coulomb repulsive force . after this local constraint and quantum fluctuations",
    "are taken into account , a strong u(1 ) gauge field emerges in the effective theory .",
    "this gauge field has important effect on physical properties since it can cause fermion condensation and give the originally massless fermions a finite mass .",
    "the af spin correlation is expected to be significantly enhanced once the fermions become massive . to show this actually happens",
    ", we will calculate the spin correlation function in the csb phase ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "although the dynamically generated fermion mass depends on the 3-momentum , here , for simplicity , we assume a constant mass @xmath164 for the fermions .",
    "this approximation is valid because we only care about the low - energy property and @xmath24 is actually a constant at @xmath165 .",
    "the propagator for the massive fermion is @xmath166 which leads to @xmath167 this spin correlation behaves like @xmath168 as @xmath165 and we have long - range af correlation when csb takes place .",
    "therefore , strong fluctuations around the rvb ground state enhances the long - range af spin correlations .",
    "we should emphasize that calculations based on perturbative expansions can not be used to obtain the long - range af order .",
    "it might be argued that including higher order diagram can enhance the af spin correlation .",
    "however , this argument is not right .",
    "if we include the gauge field while keeping the fermions massless , then the spin correlation is [ 37 ] @xmath169 which damps at low momentum @xmath165 .",
    "rantner and wen [ 37 ] used to claim that long - range af correlation can be obtained by reexponentiating the spin correlation function [ 38 ] .",
    "this scenario is based on their previous statement [ 14 ] that the u(1 ) gauge field can not generate a finite mass for fermions and hence is a marginal perturbation .",
    "this result is derived by considering only the one - loop correction of gauge field to the fermion self - energy .",
    "however , csb is a nonperturbative phenomenon and whether the gauge field generates a finite mass for the massless fermions can only be settled by investigating the self - consistent ds equation for the fermion self - energy . if the equation ( 12 ) does not have the nonlinear term in the denominator of the kernel , it is a linear equation and can @xmath63 develop any genuine nontrivial solution . from the point of view of bifurcation theory ,",
    "a linear operator has no bifurcation points those are necessary for a phase transition to take place .",
    "once the nonperturbative effect is taken into account , the strong gauge field generates a finite fermion mass which breaks the chiral symmetry and gives rise to long - range af order ( ref.[39 ] discussed the correspondence of csb to af order in another way ) .",
    "actually , the formation of long - range af order spontaneously breaks the rational symmetry of the system and generates a gapless spin wave excitation which corressponds to the massless goldstone boson .",
    "these are hard to understand if we only include the gauge fluctuations without breaking any symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the strong interaction of the gauge field with massless fermions of flavor @xmath76 will unavoidably generate a finite fermion mass .",
    "now we would like to discuss the application of our result to the interplay of various ground states in high temperature cuprate superconductors .",
    "it is well - known that the gauge boson mass @xmath1 is proportional to the superfluid density @xmath170 , thus we can use @xmath1 to describe the superconducting order",
    ". otherwise , we use csb to describe the long - range af order . based on the fact that the superfluid density is proportional to doping concentration",
    ", we obtain a clear picture of the evolution of different orders upon increasing the doping concentration . at zero and low",
    "doping the gauge boson mass is zero or very small , so csb and hence the af order is present . when the doping concentration is larger than a critical value @xmath171 the gauge boson",
    "acquire a mass that is large enough to suppress the csb and the af order .",
    "note that superconductivity begins to appear as the ground state of cuprate superconductors at @xmath172 which is less than @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath173 there is a coexistence of the af order and the sc order in the bulk materials .",
    "due to this coexistence , the length scale for af order to appear should be larger than the vortex scale , which is consistent with stm experiments of hoffman @xmath4 @xmath174 [ 36 ] .",
    "when the external magnetic field is stronger than @xmath175 , the superfluid is completely suppressed , and , correspondingly , the gauge boson become massless",
    ". then csb reappears in the bulk material and gives a mass to the massless fermions .",
    "this mass provides a finite gap for the low energy fermions to be excited , thus at low temperature no fermionic excitations can be observed [ 15 ] .",
    "this causes the breakdown of the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law in the normal ground state of cuprate superconductors [ 15,40 ] .",
    "thus , based on spin - charge separation and csb , we give a unified description for both the behaviors of af spin correlation and the transport properties from a field theoretical point of view .",
    "this is the most noticeable advantage of our scenario comparing with so many other scenarios [ 41 - 47 ] those also address the problem of local af order in vortex cores .",
    "confinement is one unresolved problem in modern particle physics .",
    "a seminal paper written by polyakov [ 22 ] has shed some light on this problem by studying a three - dimentional compact pure u(1 ) gauge theory ( compact pure qed@xmath0 ) . in general",
    ", one can define an abelian gauge theory on a two - dimensional lattice which has the following action @xmath176 with the field strength @xmath177 here , the pairs ( @xmath178,@xmath179 ) are used to denote the links between lattices , with @xmath178 the beginning of a link and @xmath179 its direction . if the vector potential @xmath180 is defined to be a real number on its whole region , i.e. , @xmath181 , the continuum limit of this action is just that of the usual u(1 ) gauge as presented in ( 1 ) .",
    "however , a highly nontrivial physical effect emerges if the vector potential @xmath180 has angular properties and hence is defined on a circle as @xmath182 . due to the periodicity of its action , such a field theory is called compact qed .",
    "polyakov firstly considered the pure compact qed@xmath0 without coupling matter fields to the gauge field .",
    "he found that instantons appear in this model as topological solutions of the euclidean gauge field equations and lead to permanent confinement of static charges which is reflected by the area law for the wilson integral .",
    "compact qed@xmath0 has attracted intense investigations in the past twenty years , initially as a simpler model to study quark confinement .",
    "recently , compact qed@xmath0 with matter fields has been used to model the physics of many strongly correlated electron systems [ 19,48 ] . however , although it is widely accepted that confinement is present in pure compact qed@xmath0 , there is no consensus on the fate of permanent confinement when matter fields are included [ 49,50 ] . comparing with compact qed@xmath0 of scalar fields [ 49 ] , the situation for compact qed@xmath0 of massless fermions is particularly complicated because of the possibility of dynamical mass generation for the fermions .    since compact qed@xmath0",
    "is originally defined on lattices , monte carlo numerical simulations are expected to provide important information on csb , but they suffers from the notorious fermion sign problem . in this paper , we would like to analyze the chiral behavior using the ds equation method . to do this , we map the compact qed@xmath0 onto a continuum theory and introduce the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath55 keeping track of its lattice origin .",
    "as shown by polyakov , the gauge field acquires a finite mass due to debye screening caused by the instantons .",
    "we can use the mass @xmath1 of gauge field to describe the instanton effect and investigate the relation between csb and instanton effect by solving the ds equation that consists of a massive gauge boson propagator .",
    "we have studied the relation of gauge boson mass and csb in the context of high temperature superconductors in the last section .",
    "however , the critical gauge boson mass @xmath2 is very small in the presence of additional scalar fields , due to the shift from @xmath153 to @xmath154 by the scalar doublet , and hence csb can exist only for a small region of @xmath1 .",
    "but the critical value @xmath2 in the present case ( compact u(1 ) gauge field coupled only to massless fermions ) is much larger and there is a wide region of @xmath1 for csb to take place .",
    "in the previous papers [ 5,6 ] addressing csb in qed@xmath0 the ultraviolet cutoff is provided by @xmath183 , which is kept fixed when the fermions flavor @xmath153 is taken to infinity , because for momentum @xmath184 the self - energy function damps rapidly . from @xmath185 we know that the critical gauge boson mass is about @xmath186 .",
    "the instanton effect can coexist with csb for @xmath187 .",
    "if we couple a fermion of one flavor to compact gauge field , then csb can coexist with instanton effect in a much wider region of @xmath1 .",
    "the above result can be used to investigate the possible confinement to deconfinement transition in compact qed@xmath0 because whether the fermions have a finite mass is expected to affect the fate of permanent confinement [ 51 ] .",
    "such a transition is no doubt of great importance in both particle physics and condensed matter physics , but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the effect of a finite mass of u(1 ) gauge boson on csb and its physical implications .",
    "the gauge boson mass @xmath1 is reflected in the modification of the gauge field propagator , which appears in the ds equation of the fermion self - energy .",
    "the ds equation is nonlinear and hence hard to be solved .",
    "iteration procedure is the most frequently used numerical calculation method , but it is not clear whether the iteration procedure leads to a convergent result or not . to avoid the problem brought by the convergency of iteration , we make use of bifurcation theory and parameter imbedding method to numerically investigate the ds equation . adopting the landau gauge and neglecting the wave function renormalization",
    ", we found a critical value @xmath2 for the gauge boson mass that separates the csb phase , for @xmath188 , and chiral symmetric phase , for @xmath189 .",
    "we then showed that including higher order corrections of the wave function renormalization does not change qualitatively the critical value @xmath2 .",
    "we then use our result to two physical systems , high temperature cuprate superconductors and compact qed@xmath0 .",
    "if the gauge boson mass is generated via anderson - higgs mechanism in the superconducting state , the combination of spin - charge separation and csb provides a field theoretical description of the competition between the af order and the sc order . as a compromise of this competition",
    ", there is a microscopic coexistence of these two orders in the bulk materials , which plays an essential role in explaining the local af ordre in vortex states observed in neutron scattering and stm experiments .",
    "when the periodicity of the gauge field is taken into account , the gauge boson acquires a finite mass via the instanton effect . since",
    "whether the permanent confinement still exists in the presence of fermions depends on the fermion mass , our result can help us to investigate the confinement to deconfinement phase transition , which will be the subject of future study .",
    "we would like to thank cheng lee for his help in numerical calculations and v. p. gusynin for helpful communications . this work is supported by national science foundation in china no.10175058 .",
    "in this appendix we give the details of calculating the spin correlation using the propagator of the massive fermions .",
    "when csb occurs the fermion propagator is @xmath190then @xmath191    \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{1}{4}\\int \\frac{d^{3}k}{(2\\pi ) ^{3}}tr\\left [ \\frac{\\gamma \\cdot k+im}{k^{2}+m^{2}}\\frac{\\gamma \\cdot ( k+p)+im}{(k+p)^{2}+m^{2}}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -i\\int_{0}^{1}dt\\int \\frac{d^{3}k}{(2\\pi ) ^{3}}\\frac{k\\cdot ( k+p)-m^{2}}{% \\left [ \\left ( k^{2}+m^{2}\\right ) ( 1-t)+\\left ( ( k+p)^{2}+m^{2}\\right ) t\\right ] ^{2}},\\end{aligned}\\]]where we used the feynman parameterization formula @xmath192 ^{2}}.\\]]after replacing @xmath134 by @xmath193 and making wick rotation , we have @xmath194 ^{2}}.\\]]using the properties of the @xmath195-function , we can integrate upon the momentum @xmath134 and get @xmath196 ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}.\\]]since @xmath197@xmath198we get @xmath199 ^{\\frac{1}{2 } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\left ( m+\\frac{p^{2}+4m^{2}}{2\\left| p\\right| } \\arcsin \\left ( \\frac{p^{2}}{p^{2}+4m^{2}}\\right ) ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\]]this is the af spin correlation in the csb phase ."
