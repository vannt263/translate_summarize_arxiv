    "since the successful realization of bose - einstein condensation in bosonic @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite systems , ultracold atoms have attracted considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "one of the most active research areas in this field concerns optical lattice systems , which are generated by subjecting the trapped ultracold atoms to a periodic potential generated by appropriated laser beams  @xcite .",
    "the setups provide clean quantum systems with parameters which can be tuned in a controlled fashion .",
    "remarkable phenomena have been observed such as the phase transition between a mott insulator and a superfluid in bosonic systems  @xcite . in the fermionic case , both the superfluid state  @xcite and the mott insulating state  @xcite have been observed .",
    "furthermore , spin imbalanced populations have recently been realized  @xcite , which stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations on ultracold fermionic systems , and allow to investigate well - known ideas from conventional condensed matter physics .",
    "for the imbalanced system with attractive interactions , interesting ordered ground states have been proposed as the standard s - wave pairing at the fermi surface is then modified .",
    "one of the most prominent candidates is the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase @xcite , in which cooper pairs with nonzero total momentum are formed .",
    "this phase has been observed in the high field region in @xmath2 @xcite , and has theoretically been discussed in this compounds @xcite , as well as cold atoms with imbalanced populations @xcite .",
    "another proposed phase is the breached - pair ( bp ) phase , where both the superfluid order parameter and the magnetization are finite at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "when one considers three dimensional optical lattice systems at finite temperatures , the naively expected polarized superfluid state may be more stable than the others .",
    "however , it is not clear how the polarized superfluid state is realized , and how the pair potential and the magnetization are spatially distributed in the imbalanced system with a confining potential .",
    "understanding this issue may be important to observe the polarized superfluid state experimentally .    in order to clarify these aspects , we investigate the attractive hubbard model with imbalanced spin populations and a confining potential .",
    "this allows to discuss the effect of the imbalanced spin populations on the superfluid state . by using real - space dynamical mean - field theory ( r - dmft ) @xcite , we study the low temperature properties of the model . here",
    ", we use the continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) method @xcite based on the nambu formalism as an impurity solver @xcite . by calculating the local particle density , local magnetization and pair potential",
    ", we clarify how the polarized superfluid state is realized in the spin imbalanced system within the confining potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ 2 ] , we introduce the model hamiltonian and summarize various aspects of the r - dmft .",
    "we demonstrate how the superfluid state is realized in a fermionic optical lattice with the confining potential in sec .",
    "a brief summary is given in the last section .",
    "let us consider ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice with harmonic confinement , which may be described by the following attractive hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath3 n_{i\\sigma}\\nonumber\\\\ & -&u\\sum_i \\left[n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}-\\frac{1}{2 } \\left(n_{i\\uparrow}+n_{i\\downarrow}-1\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 annihilates ( creates ) a fermion at the @xmath5th site with spin @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 acts as a magnetic field which allows as to tune the spin population imbalance , @xmath9 is the chemical potential , @xmath10 denotes the nearest neighbor hopping and @xmath11 the attractive interaction .",
    "@xmath12 is the curvature of the harmonic potential .",
    "the notation @xmath13 indicates that the sum is restricted to nearest neighbors .",
    "@xmath14 is the distance measured from the center of the trap and @xmath15 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the ground - state properties of the hubbard model on inhomogeneous lattices have been studied theoretically by various methods such as the bogoljubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations  @xcite , the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite , the slave - boson mean - field approach  @xcite , variational monte carlo simulations  @xcite , and the local density approximation@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there are few studies addressing the effect of imbalanced populations beyond the static mean - field approach .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group method@xcite and the quantum monte carlo method@xcite are powerful for low dimensional systems , but it may encounter difficulties when applied it to higher dimensional systems . here",
    "we use the r - dmft approach  @xcite , where local particle correlations are taken into account precisely .",
    "this treatment is formally exact for the homogeneous lattice model in infinite dimensions @xcite and the method has successfully been applied to some inhomogeneous correlated systems such as the surface  @xcite or the interface of a mott insulators  @xcite , and to fermionic atoms  @xcite .    in r - dmft",
    ", the lattice model is mapped to a collection of effective impurity models .",
    "the lattice green function is then obtained via a self - consistency condition imposed on the impurity problems .",
    "when one describes the superfluid state in the framework of r - dmft @xcite , the lattice green s function should be represented in the nambu - gorkov formalism . for a system with @xmath16 lattice sites it",

    ", the point group symmetry can be employed to efficiently deduce the lattice green s function . the inverse lattice green s function eq .",
    "( [ eq : lat ] ) is transformed in terms of a unitary matrix @xmath34 , as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath37 matrix , @xmath38 is the number of elements , and @xmath5 runs over the representations of the group @xmath39 . the lattice green s function",

    "therefore , by solving fifty - eight kinds of effective impurity models and making use of eq .",
    "( [ eqlat ] ) , we can iteratively solve the r - dmft equations and discuss the stability of the polarized superfluid state in the large cluster .    when r - dmft is applied to our inhomogeneous system ,",
    "it is necessary to solve a large number of effective impurity models .",
    "there are various numerical techniques such as exact diagonalization@xcite and the numerical renormalization group @xcite .",
    "one of the most powerful methods is ctqmc , which has been developed recently . in this method ,",
    "monte carlo samplings of collections of diagrams for the partition function are performed in continuous time .",
    "therefore , the trotter error , which originates from the suzuki - trotter decomposition , is avoided .",
    "furthermore , this method is efficient and applicable to more general classes of models than , for example , the hirsch - fye algorithm@xcite .",
    "the ctqmc method has successfully been applied to various systems such as the hubbard model @xcite , the periodic anderson model @xcite , the kondo lattice model @xcite , and the holstein - hubbard model.@xcite here , we use the continuous - time auxiliary field ( ctaux ) version of weak - coupling ctqmc @xcite to discuss the superfluid state in the optical lattice system .",
    "some details of the ctqmc method are explained in [ appendix ] .",
    "we now consider a three - dimensional optical lattice system with a confining potential to discuss how the superfluid state is realized in this spatially inhomogeneous set - up . in this paper , we use the hopping integral @xmath44 as the unit of the energy and fix the confining potential as @xmath45 and the total particle number as @xmath46 .",
    "we calculate site - dependent static physical quantities such as the particle density @xmath47 , the pair potential @xmath48 and the magnetization @xmath49 , which are defined by @xmath50 by performing r - dmft with the ctqmc method , we obtain these quantities first for the balanced system @xmath51 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "decreasing the temperature , the particles gather around the center of the system , which is due to the existence of the attractive interaction .",
    "below a certain critical temperature @xmath56 , the pair potential @xmath48 becomes finite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "this means that a superfluid state is realized in the region with @xmath57 .",
    "it is also found that the magnitude of pair potential depends on the site .",

    ", width=302 ]    this case is similar to a system with applied magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the superfluid state should become unstable @xcite .",
    "in fact , in contrast to the balanced system , the normal metallic state is stabilized even at @xmath63 .",
    "further decrease of the temperature @xmath64 induces the pair potential in a certain region @xmath65 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "since the magnetization is finite in this region , we conclude that the polarized superfluid state is realized in the region @xmath66 . on the other hand ,",
    "the normal metallic state still remains in the region @xmath67 .",
    "note that at @xmath68 , the pair potential has a maximum in the center of the system , where particle pairs are strongly formed . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) , the magnetization at the center of the trap first increases on reducing the temperature . however , when the system becomes superfluid , the magnetization is suppressed and the maximum is pushed to larger values of @xmath14 resulting in a non - monotonic behavior appears in the magnetization curve .",
    "it is expected that further decrease of the temperature will lead to a complete suppression of the magnetization near the center of the trap .",
    "detailed calculations will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have investigated ultracold fermionic atoms trapped in an optical lattice with spin imbalanced populations . by combining the real - space dynamical mean - field theory with continuous - time quantum monte carlo simulations based on the nambu formalism",

    "we have demonstrated how a polarized superfluid state is spatially realized at low temperatures in the model with harmonic confinement .    in this paper , we have studied the stability of the polarized superfluid state in a system with small number of fermions . if the total particle number is larger , the local particle density may increase beyond @xmath69 .",
    "it is known that the density wave state and the superfluid state are degenerate in the homogeneous system at half filling @xmath70 except in one dimension , which means that a supersolid state might be realizable in an optical lattice system with modulated particle density .",
