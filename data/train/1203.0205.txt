    "over the past decades , an extensive development has been made on the penrose cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch).@xmath3 according to this hypothesis , the singularities arising from the gravitational collapse of regular initial data are always invisible to the far away observer as these are clothed by the event horizons of black hole .",
    "on the other hand , if a naked singularity is formed as end state of the collapse , then it is visible to the external observer .",
    "since black hole and naked singularity have different properties , it becomes important to explore the problem of collapse in order to have a satisfactory asnwer of the cch .",
    "depending on the choice of initial data , the gravitational collapse of a realistic matter leads to the formation of black hole or naked singularity.@xmath4 virbhadra and his collaborators @xmath5 introduced the idea of gravitational lensing to determine the nature of singularity .",
    "in one of his papers@xmath6 , he presented an improved form of the cch , which is a source of inspiration for researchers .",
    "the study of gravitational collapse requires that one must consider the appropriate geometry of the interior and exterior regions of a star and junction conditions which allow the smooth matching of these regions . according to israel@xmath7 , there are two types of the boundary surface one with thin layer of surface matter distribution and the other without such thin layer .",
    "the matching conditions over the second type of the boundary surface demands the continuity of the metric coefficients as well as the extrinsic curvature components .",
    "this leads to the classical model of the relativistic gravitational collapse formulated by oppenheimer and snyder.@xmath8 on the other hand , matching the interior and exterior regions over a boundary surface with thin layer of matter requires the discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature over the boundary surface .",
    "this approach has been used successfully for more than thirty years to analyze the nature of singularity in the relativistic gravitational collapse .",

    "this approach was generalized to thin charged shell without pressure by de ia cruz and israel.@xmath12 kuchar@xmath13 and chase@xmath14 are among the first authors who treated the charged thin shell problem with pressure by using the polytropic equation of state .",
    "there are a number of papers devoted to handle the charged thin shell problems .",
    "boulware@xmath15 studied the time evolution of the charged thin shell and showed that their collapse can form a naked singularity .    according to doplicer et al.@xmath16 ,",
    "when the energy density becomes sufficiently large , a black hole is formed .",
    "heisenberg uncertainty principle states that measurement of a spacetime separation causes an uncertainty in momentum , i.e. , momentum is inversely proportional to the extent of the separation . when the separation is small enough ( as in the schwarzschild spacetime , @xmath17 ) , the system leads to the formation of black hole which prevents any information escaping from the system .",
    "thus there is a lower bound for the measurement of length .",
    "the condition for preventing the gravitational collapse can be expressed as uncertainty relation for the coordinates .",

    "the non - commutative correction to the shell collapse is presented in section * 3*. in the last section , we summarize and conclude the results .",
    "we assume that the @xmath23 timelike boundary surface @xmath24 splits the two @xmath25 spherically symmetric spacetimes @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "notice that different values of @xmath2 correspond to different types of matter , for example , for @xmath67 , we have perfect fluid .",
    "the solution of eq.([16 ] ) , by using ( [ 17 ] ) , for finite and infinite values of @xmath2 are @xmath68 respectively , where @xmath69 is the position of the shell at @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the density of matter on the shell at position @xmath69 .",

    "now we discuss eqs.([20a])-([22a ] ) graphically following the recent papers.@xmath83 fig .",
    "1 describes the behavior of effective potential ( [ 22 ] ) for the collapsing polytropic matter with finite @xmath2 and shell initial data .",
    "the left graph in fig .",
    "2 indicates the behavior of effective potential ( [ 22a ] ) for the perfect fluid shell depending on the eos parameter and shell initial data .",
    "all these graphs show that @xmath84 , thus eq.([20a ] ) implies that motion is possible as @xmath85 .",
    "the left graphs in both figures show that the effective potential increases from @xmath86 to @xmath87 and then decreases from @xmath87 to finite negative value .",
    "this implies that expanding or collapsing shell of matter comes to static state and then expands or collapse . the right graph in fig .",
    "1 represents the following three phases :    1 .",
    "initially @xmath88 as @xmath89 , in this case , polytropic matter shell will expand to infinity for large initial radius or collapses to zero radius , forming a black hole or naked singularity . in both cases bouncing",
    "would occur if initial shell velocity is negative or positive , respectively .",
    "2 .   when @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "the matter shell attains the non - static equilibrium state as @xmath92 increases .",
    "3 .   @xmath93 for some values of @xmath92 .",
    "this implies that static shell comes to the state of expansion or collapse . in case of no crossing to @xmath92-axis ,",
    "the shell collapses to zero or expands to infinity depending on the choice of the shell initial data .",
    "the effect of charge parameter on the dynamics of the shell can be determined by the shell equation of motion given by @xmath94 here @xmath95 correspond to expansion and collapse of the shell , respectively .",
    "it follows from this equation that the presence of the charge term ( coulomb repulsive force ) decreases the velocity of the expanding or collapsing shell .",
    "also , we would like to mention here that this behavior of charge parameter is the same for the cases of finite and infinite @xmath2 . in this case , the shell motion is slow as compared to the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "since the equation of motion ( [ 20a ] ) is nonlinear , its exact solution is impossible but can be solved numerically .",
    "the numerical solution of this equation for suitable choice of initial data and for some initial value of shell radius gives the behavior of the shell radius with respect to time shown in right fig .",
    "this shows that radius decreases with the increase of time which is the strong argument for a shell to collapse .",
    "also , radius is an increasing function of time which shows expansion .",
    "in this section , we study gravitational collapse in the non - commutative rn geometry .",
    "first , we discuss the effects of the non - commutative factor @xmath96 on junction conditions which provide the equations of motion . the spacetime non - commutativity can be encoded by the following relation@xmath18 @xmath97=\\iota{\\theta}^{\\mu\\nu},\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is an anti - symmetric matrix that determines the spacetime cell discretization as @xmath99 ( planck s constant ) discretizes the phase space .",
    "there are different approaches to the non - commutative field theory out of which one is based on the @xmath100-product and another on the coordinate coherent state formalism . recently , following the second approach , smailagic and spallucci@xmath101 have shown that the problems of lorentz invariance and unitary ( arising in the @xmath100-product approach ) can be solved by considering @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is constant with dimensions of length squared . also , the coordinate coherent state modifies the feynman propagators .",
    "thus it is believed that non - commutativity removes the singularities ( divergences ) appearing in gr . in gr ,",
    "the metric field is a geometrical structure and curvature ( presence of matter ) measures its strength . since non - commutativity is the fundamental property of the metric , so it affects gravity via curvature .",
    "this implies that non - commutativity influences the matter energy - momentum tensor .",
    "thus the geometric part of the field equations is left unchanged and modification is made in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "following this philosophy , we shall make only modification in matter part of the junction conditions and leave the geometric part unchanged .",
    "the line element for this metric is@xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 and lower incomplete gamma function is defined by @xmath107 in the commutative limit @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath109 , eq.([23 ] ) reduces to conventional rn metric ( [ 1 ] ) ( for detail , see the properties of gamma function in the appendix @xmath19 .    here",
    "we assume the smeared gravitating source in the non - commutative geometry and use the modified energy density and pressure@xmath22 @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the energy density and pressure of the shell used in the previous section while @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the energy density and pressure of the smeared source in the non - commutative theory .",
    "since pressure and density of matter are effected by the non - commutative factor @xmath96 , so equation of state is also effected by this factor .",
    "recently , bertolami and zarro @xmath21 have pointed out this effect by studying the astrophysical objects in the context of non - commutativity . for non - commutative energy density , @xmath114 and pressure , @xmath115 , eq.([16 ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath116 it is well - known that @xmath117 and @xmath115 satisfy the following relation@xmath22 @xmath118 thus the non - commutative energy density is @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the value of @xmath114 at position @xmath69 .",
    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath121 or @xmath122 , this matter acts as a matter of constant density .",
    "thus the modified energy density for finite @xmath2 is @xmath123    also , for perfect fluid , we have @xmath124 equation of motion of the shell is @xmath125 where @xmath126 using @xmath127 as in the previous case , we get the modified energy density and effective potential for finite @xmath2 as follows @xmath128 also , using eqs.([28 ] ) and ( [ 30 ] ) , the effective potential for the perfect fluid is @xmath129    now we discuss the behavior of eqs.([29])-([31a ] ) graphically .",
    "it follows from figs .",
    "4 - 6 that the effective potential ( 36 ) increases from negative to zero for polytropic matter with varying @xmath103 and fixed @xmath66 .",
    "the similar behavior of the effective potential ( 37 ) for the perfect fluid shell is shown in the left fig .",
    "it is mentioned here that we have only considered the case for which @xmath130 in order to exclude the possibility of the exotic matter ( dark energy ) shell for which @xmath131 .",
    "this implies that depending on the choice of initial data , the shell continuously expands or collapses to a finite size then comes to rest position .",
    "after a shell attains a last stage of rest position , it has no capability to re - expand or re - collapse to zero size .",
    "all the graphs in non - commutative background have @xmath93 at @xmath91 , neither of them is divergent at @xmath132 .",
    "this confirms that non - commutativity can measure the short distances up to the order of plank s length scale .",
    "this can be seen by investigating the horizon radius and point of singularity where density diverges .",
    "the exact solution of nonlinear equation ( [ 29 ] ) is impossible .",
    "as before , we solve this equation by using numerical technique with initial condition .",
    "the behavior of the shell radius in this case is shown in right graph of fig .",
    "the black hole horizon can be found by solving @xmath133 for @xmath134 and taking initially @xmath135 , the position of the horizon by iterative method is @xmath136 for finite @xmath2 , the modified energy density ( [ 30a ] ) as well as the effective potential ( [ 31 ] ) for polytropic matter shell in non - commutative case are singular at @xmath137 .",
    "although this is independent of @xmath96 but it is the only value of @xmath92 at which modified energy density and effective potential diverge .",
    "further , all graphs of the effective potential for polytropic matter in fig .",
    "3 - 6 for non - commutative case imply that @xmath138 diverges negatively at @xmath91 , while the right graph of fig .",
    "1 in commutative case for polytropic matter imply that @xmath88 at @xmath132 .",
    "this means that the non - commutative parameter @xmath96 has shifted the singularity from @xmath132 to @xmath91 .",
    "hence , for the values of the parameters , @xmath139 and @xmath71 used for the solutions previously , we get @xmath140 at which polytropic matter shell in non - commutative case becomes singular . from the values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 , we conclude that `` shell radii are greater than the singular point ( where density diverges ) '' i.e. , horizon covers the singularity at point @xmath140 which leads to the formation of black hole as the final fate of the collapse as shown in fig .",
    "for the case of infinite @xmath2 , the energy density as well as the effective potential diverge at @xmath132 .",
    "thus for each value of @xmath96 , the corresponding values of horizon radius are greater than zero , hence a singular shell of zero radius seems to be covered by the horizon radius .",
    "consequently , we can say that perfect fluid shell collapse in non - commutative geometry always ends as a black hole .",
    "hence in non - commutativity , polytropic matter shell collapses to a circle of small non - zero radius , while perfect fluid shell collapses to zero radius .",
    "the clear effects of @xmath96 appear in the presence of generic polytropic matter .",
    "this paper is devoted to study the gravitational collapse of polytropic matter shell collapse in non - commutative rn geometry . using the israel junction conditions between the interior and exterior regions of a star , we have formulated equation of motion of the shell .",
    "it has been found that solution of this equation represents collapse and expansion depending on the choice of initial data .",
    "further , by taking the polytropic index @xmath2 finite and infinite ( perfect fluid ) , the effective potential of the system has been discussed in detail .",
    "the behavior of the effective potential for the polytropic matter with finite @xmath2 shows that the matter can undergo an expansion , collapse or bouncing depending on the choice of initial data .",
    "similarly , the effective potential of the system for infinite @xmath2 ( perfect fluid ) predicts different stages of dynamics of the shell depending on the choice of initial data .    in order to understand the effects of non - commutative factor @xmath96 on the gravitational collapse ,",
    "a smeared source in the non - commutative rn spacetime has been taken .",
    "we have adopted the non - commutative approach@xmath22 to see the effects of the non - commutative factor @xmath96 on the collapse . using the modified matter components , the shell equations of motion for polytropic matter with finite and infinite @xmath2",
    "have been derived . in this approach",
    ", we have found that in the presence of @xmath96 an initially an expanding or collapsing matter shell comes to static equilibrium .",
    "it can not further , re - expand to infinity or re - collapse to zero size shown in figs . 3 - 7 .",
    "in other words in non - commutative the end state is a bh with some non - zero horizon radius .",
    "it has been found that the charge parameter @xmath143 effects the velocity of the expanding or collapsing shell but does not play a dominant role to bring a shell to static equilibrium . for charged to be dominant",
    "it is necessary that effective potential must vanish in general , so that we get velocity @xmath144 . since it is not possible in general ,",
    "so charge only effects the dynamics of the shell but doesnot prevent the collapse .",
    "further , the solution of @xmath145 for the non - commutative rn spacetime gives the horizon radius .",
    "for the larger value of @xmath96 factor , it has been found that the horizon radius covers the singularity where density is undefined for the case of polytropic matter with finite @xmath2 . for any non - zero value of @xmath96 , perfect fluid always collapse to form a black hole .",
    "thus in the non - commutative approach , there is a validity of the cch depending on the choice of initial data .    after the work of oh and park@xmath22",
    ", the present work is the second step towards the thin shell collapse in non - commutative theory . although both papers involve the numerical solutions however , it is expected that this kind of study would lead to find an exactly solvable collapsing model in non - commutative theory of gravity as oppenheimer - synder@xmath8 classical collapsing model in gr .",
    "the thin shell formalism was used for a wide class of cosmological and and astrophysical problems @xmath146 which could be extended by using non - commutative approach .",
