    "one of the most promising ways in which to probe the nature of weakly - interacting - massive - particle ( wimp ) dark matter is provided by indirect detection experiments in which the annihilation products of dark matter in astrophysical contexts are observed .",
    "indirect detection experiments such as ams @xcite , atic @xcite , egret @xcite , glast @xcite , heat @xcite , hess @xcite , integral @xcite , pamela@xcite , and veritas @xcite look for signals ranging across energetic gamma rays , positron excesses , and anti - proton fluxes , and hints of deviations from background expectations now abound . a common feature in the interpretation of these experiments is that the wimp annihilation proceeds via simple , almost free - particle annihilation leading to a rate that depends on the wimp relative velocity in only a very simple , essentially structureless way , and moreover , is directly related to the cross - section that led to the dm density at freeze - out .",
    "this assumption then implies that the primary astrophysical quantity determining the fluxes from dm annihilation is the local dm squared - density , @xmath2 , with the velocity distribution of the dm being essentially irrelevant .",
    "in addition the assumption of almost free - particle annihilation gives a relatively simple resulting energy spectrum for the annihilation products ( though of course features such as steep falls at kinematic thresholds are generic ) .",
    "the dependence of the annihilation fluxes on @xmath2 has been widely employed in the suggested interpretations of the various experimental anomalies as , very frequently , a so - called  boost - factor \" in the annihilation rate is required to match the observed flux , and this is assumed to come from local over - densities of dm .    in this paper",
    "we point out that annihilation of wimp dark matter via intermediate long - lived  wimponium \" bound states , @xmath3 , is possible in many particle physics models of dm @xcite ( see @xcite for another recent discussion of wimponium ) . as we argue below",
    ", the wimponium bound states can occur at or near threshold in which case they lead to potentially very substantial ( factors of @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) enhancements in the dm annihilation rate , closely related to the well - known sommerfeld non - perturbative enhancement @xcite that has been applied to freeze - out calculations and indirect dark matter signals @xcite .",
    "the existence of this @xmath6- independent dynamically - induced  boost factor \" has important implications : first large amplifications can occur in low - velocity - dispersion systems without a large ( eg , cusp - like ) density enhancement , possibly preferring colder less dense objects such as dwarf galaxies as more promising places to search for dm signals compared to the higher density but higher velocity galactic center .",
    "second , a knowledge of the full phase space density of the dm is necessary to reliably compute the dm annihilation rate , which strengthens further the case for detailed realistic simulations of the dm distribution in our galaxy .",
    "in addition , the deeply - bound wimponium spectrum is often quite involved , and the radiative capture to and transitions among the various states generically lead to a rich energy spectrum of annihilation products , with many distinct lines ( in the case of decays to @xmath0 or @xmath1 final states , similar to that found in wimp annihilations @xcite ) possible .",
    "although the observability , or otherwise of these distinct lines depends on the dm model being studied , and especially the resolution of the detector , the existence of all the various radiative capture modes further enhances the total annihilation rate , and the detection of even just a few of the lines would give direct information on the interactions of the dm particles .",
    "in order to demonstrate the important features of wimponium bound states it is useful to examine a simple , almost model independent , example . we introduce two complex scalar fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 with the following interactions and masses @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a dimensionless coupling and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are mass dimension one parameters .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 ( typically we will take @xmath15 , while @xmath16 ) .",
    "a discrete symmetry is imposed forcing @xmath7 particles to appear in the lagrangian in pairs so the @xmath7 scalar will be the stable dark matter wimp .",
    "as we have indicated in the introduction we are interested in two related phenomena : 1 ) the scattering of slow moving particles near bound state thresholds leading to amplification of the direct annihilation rate ; 2 ) the radiative capture to and decay of deeply bound states and transitions between different bound states .",
    "since we are interested in low - velocity processes we can proceed by solving the schrdinger equation for the two-@xmath7-particle system with the yukawa potential @xmath17 that follows from the exchange of @xmath8-scalars . here",
    "semi - classical considerations show that the number of bound states @xmath19 of given orbital angular momentum @xmath20 satisfies @xcite @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the reduced mass of the two particle system , so , for example , the number of s - wave bound states in our case satisfies @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "a more precise condition for there to be at least one bound state follows from numerical methods giving @xcite @xmath25 .",
    "thus if we want to have a rich structure of energy levels our dark matter particles will either need to have large couplings with the @xmath8 scalar or need to have @xmath26 , or both .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the most important phenomenology  the large amplification of the dm annihilation rate  requires only a single at - threshold bound state , and so imposes only a mild condition on the coupling .",
    "for instance for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , we require @xmath29 which is well within the perturbative regime @xmath30 .",
    "note that , upon writing the complex scalar @xmath7 in terms of its cp - even and odd parts @xmath31 , we have , due to bose symmetry , that the @xmath32 and @xmath33 bound states can only possess even orbital angular momentum @xmath34 , while the angular momentum of the @xmath35 bound states is unrestricted .    turning to the scattering of two slow moving @xmath7 particles by the yukawa potential arising from the @xmath8 scalar exchange interaction , both elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections ( such as radiative capture )",
    "are amplified by a non - perturbative sommerfeld - like enhancement .",
    "this enhancement can be formulated in terms of a non - relativistic quantum two - body problem with a potential acting between the incoming particles . to a good approximation",
    "this leads to a dressing of the dominant @xmath36-wave part of the tree - level cross sections by a multiplicative factor , ^l=0=r^l=0_tree .",
    "[ rfactor ] an exact analytic calculation of @xmath37 for a yukawa potential is not possible ( although we give a close analytic approximation later ) and so we must proceed numerically . the schrdinger equation for the radial part of the two dark matter particle state , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 ,",
    "reads @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the kinetic energy of the two dark matter particles in the center - of - mass frame , where each dark matter particle has velocity @xmath42 . using the outgoing boundary conditions , @xmath43 , @xmath37",

    "shown is a typical  path \" in parameter space as the velocity of the @xmath7 states decreases from the value at freeze - out to that relevant for indirect detection .",

    "this is the part of parameter space relevant for freeze - out , the magnitude of the enhancements being at most a factor of 3 to 5 @xcite .",
    "more interesting is the low - velocity region in which we see the effect of resonance peaks .",
    "these peaks correspond to the formation of @xmath39 bound states at threshold ( @xmath53 ) , and are the focus of this analysis .",
    "provided we are sufficiently close to a resonance peak , the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath54 and @xmath55 is described by a modified breit - wigner resonance formula applicable for threshold resonances due to bethe and placzek ( bp ) @xcite .",
    "considering only elastic scattering , the breit - wigner resonance cross section is @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the elastic dissociation and total width for the resonant bound state and @xmath59 is the distance of the resonance from exact zero - energy and is independent of @xmath42 .",

    "a useful way of thinking about and calculating approximately the amplification of the elastic and inelastic cross sections is in terms of the diverging scattering lengths that occur when a bound state energy tends to zero .",

    "<S> wimponium bound states can occur at or near threshold leading to substantial enhancements in the dm annihilation rate , closely related to the sommerfeld effect . </S>",
    "<S> large  boost factor \" amplifications in the annihilation rate can thus occur without large density enhancements , possibly preferring colder less dense objects such as dwarf galaxies as locations for indirect dm searches . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative capture to and transitions among the wimponium states generically lead to a rich energy spectrum of annihilation products , with many distinct lines possible in the case of 2-body decays to @xmath0 or @xmath1 final states . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of multiple radiative capture modes further enhances the total annihilation rate , and the detection of the lines would give direct over - determined information on the nature and self - interactions of the dm particles . </S>"
