    "sulfur - bearing molecules are not only excellent tracers of early protostellar evolution ( van der tak et al . 2003 ) , but also of specific interest because of its rapid evolution in warm gas ( charnley 1997 ; hatchell , 1998a , b ) . unlike nitrogen chemistry or oxygen chemistry , most of the molecules involved are easy to detect at mm and submm wavelengths and column densities can be calculated easily , thus sulfur is a potential good clock on time scales relevant to the embedded phase of star formation .",
    "chemical evolution of sulphur - bearing molecules have been well studied in low - mass star - forming regions , e.g. , buckel & fuller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied chemical evolution of h@xmath1s , so and so@xmath1 in low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "they demonstrated that the chemical evolution of sulphur - bearing species was a potentially valuable probe of chemical timescales in low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "however , this issue has been less developed in the context of high - mass star - forming regions .",

    "( 1998a , 1998b ) studied the sulphur chemistry of eight sources associated with uch ii regions . the observed abundance ratios vary little from source to source .",
    "van der tak et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied the sulfur chemistry in nine high - mass protostars and found that high - energy transitions probing the inner parts of the protostars where the temperature exceeds 100 k were mandatory for using s - bearing molecules as chemical clocks .",
    "they proposed that ocs was the main carrier of sulfur on grains , based on the high excitation temperature of the molecule and its high abundance in the protostars .",
    "since hydrogenation is expected to be the most efficient process on grains , h@xmath1s  could be formed on interstellar grains ( van dishoeck & blake 1998 ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that during the cold collapse phase , sulphur atoms freeze out onto grains and remain there in the form of h@xmath1s  until core heating begins . at this point ,",
    "h@xmath1s  is evaporated from the grains , and rapidly undergoes reactions which drive the production of so and so@xmath1 ( e.g. , charnley 1997 ; wakelam et al . 2004 , 2011 ) .",
    "the initial destruction of h@xmath1s  by h@xmath2o@xmath3 is more efficient in the high - mass objects than in low - mass protostars , as water is more abundant there ( van der tak et al .",

    "they showed that , provided there is a monotonic increase in the temperature of the gas and dust surrounding the protostar , the changes in the chemical evolution of each species due to differential desorption are important .",
    "they proposed that the abundance ratio of sulphur - bearing species , like [ cs]/[h@xmath1s ] , [ ocs]/[h@xmath1s ] , [ cs]/[so ] , [ so]/[ocs ] , can be used to investigate the evolution of the early phases of massive star - formation , and that sulphur - bearing species are good chemical clocks. esplugues et al .",

    ", in prep . ) .",
    "high - excitation energy lines require high temperatures to excite , so the no - detections mean that there is no evidence for hot cores in line - poor sources .",
    "since massive star - formation takes place on rather short timescales and in clustered environments , the transitions from one into the next stage are smooth and not always clearly distinct",
    ". there might be overlaps among the hot massive core ( hmc ) and uch ii region stages . due to the large beam , regions with different evolutionary stages in their proximity",
    "can also be observed as one objects showing the characteristics of different stages .",
    "this situation was noted by hatchell et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , and they divided their uch ii sample into line - rich and line - poor sources .",
    "thus we also divided our sources into two groups .",
    "sources with detectable ch@xmath2cn emission ( 220 ghz ) above 2@xmath10 ( @xmath110.1 k ) level are labeled as h ii - hot core ( h ii - hc ) , while sources without detectable ch@xmath2cn emission above 2@xmath10 ( @xmath110.1 k ) level are labeled as h ii - only . the brightness of ch@xmath2cn emission does not correlate with distance , implying intrinsic differences in the source properties , rather than simply beam - dilution effects ( hatchell et al .",
    "1998a ) . for the h ii - hc sources ,",
    "though they are already surrounded by an ionized medium , they still show rich hot core chemistry . on the contrary , the h ii - only sources without signature of hot core",
    "could better represent chemistry in uch ii stage .",
    "thus the h ii - hc sources are regarded to be younger than the h ii - only sources because they contain younger components ( gerner et al .",

    "the classification information is also listed in table 2 .",
    "spectra from each of the molecules toward all the sources are given in figure 1 to 4 ( on - line only ) .",

    "the ocs / o@xmath0cs  intensity ratio is significantly lower than the expected abundance ratio of about 45 , suggesting that ocs is optically thick .",

    "we did not detect emission from @xmath27so ( 217.831762 ghz ) above 2@xmath10 ( @xmath110.1 k ) in these sources , suggesting that @xmath28so emission is almost optically thin .",
