    "modern astrophysical and cosmological data strongly indicate that a significant amount of matter in the universe exists in the form of _ dark matter_. the nature of dark matter ( dm ) remains completely unknown and its existence presents one of the major challenges to modern physics .",
    "it is commonly believed that the dark matter is made of particles",
    ". however , the standard model of elementary particles fails to provide a dm candidate .",
    "therefore the hypothesis of a particle nature of dm implies extension of the standard model .",
    "_ weakly interacting massive particles _ ( wimps ) are probably the most popular class of dm candidates .",
    "they appear in many extensions of the standard model ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these stable particles interact with the sm sector with roughly electroweak strength  @xcite .",
    "to provide a correct dark matter abundance , wimps should have mass in the gev range .",
    "a significant experimental effort is devoted to the detection of the interaction of wimps in the galaxy s dm halo with laboratory nucleons ( _ direct detection experiments _ , see e.g.  @xcite ) or to finding their annihilation signal in space ( _ indirect detection experiments _ , see e.g.  @xcite ) .    another large class of dm candidates",
    "are _ superweakly _ interacting particles ( so called _ super - wimps _ ) , i.e. particles , whose interaction strength with the sm particles is much more feeble than the weak one .",
    "super - wimps appear in many extensions of the standard model : extensions of the sm by right - handed neutrinos @xcite , supersymmetric theories  @xcite , models with extra dimensions  @xcite and string - motivated models  @xcite .",
    "the feeble interaction strength makes the laboratory detection of super - wimps challenging ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", many super - wimp particles possess a _",
    "2-body radiative decay _ channel : @xmath10 , producing a photon with energy @xmath11 .",
    "one can therefore search for the presence of such a monochromatic line with energy in the spectra of dm - containing objects  @xcite .",
    "although the lifetime of any realistic decaying dm is much longer than the lifetime of the universe ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the huge amount of potentially decaying dm particles in a typical halo means a potentially detectable decay signal in the spectra of dm - dominated objects .",
    "searching for such a line provides a major way of _ detection of super - wimp dm particles_.    the strategy of the search for decaying dark matter signal drastically differs from its annihilation counterpart .",
    "indeed , the _ decay _ signal is proportional to the _ dm column density _  integral of a dm distribution @xmath12 along the line of sight @xmath13 as opposed to @xmath14 in the case for annihilating dm .",
    "the dm column density varies slowly with the mass of dm objects  @xcite and as a result a vast variety of astrophysical objects of different nature would produce a comparable decay signal  @xcite",
    ". therefore    without sacrificing the expected signal one has a freedom of choosing observational targets , avoiding complicated astrophysical backgrounds ;    if a candidate line is found , its surface brightness profile may be measured ( as it does not decay quickly away from the centers of the objects ) and distinguished from astrophysical lines that usually decay in outskirts of galaxies and clusters . moreover , any tentative detection in one object would imply a signal of certain ( comparable ) signal - to - noise ratio from a number of other objects .",
    "this can be checked and the signal can either be unambiguously confirmed to be that of dm decay origin or ruled out .    this allows to distinguish the decaying dm line from any possible astrophysical background and therefore makes astrophysical search for the decaying dm _ another type of a direct detection experiment_.    in this paper we demonstrate the power of this approach .",

    "we compare the signals from several objects and show that the spatial ( angular ) behavior of the spectral feature is inconsistent with its dm origin so strongly , that systematic uncertainties can not affect this conclusion .",
