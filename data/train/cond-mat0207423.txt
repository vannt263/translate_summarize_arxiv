    "one of the most extensively studied phases of liquid crystals , both for basic research and for applications , is the smectic - c * ( smc * ) phase of chiral molecules . in this phase ,",
    "the molecules lie in layers and are tilted with respect to the layer normal direction .",
    "the combination of molecular chirality , smectic layering , and tilt order leads to two effects : a ferroelectric polarization within the smectic layer plane and a helical modulation in the orientation of the molecular tilt from layer to layer  @xcite .",
    "the ferroelectric polarization is useful for display devices , which use an applied electric field to switch the molecular orientation  @xcite .",
    "it is also useful for thermal sensors , which measure the temperature variation of the polarization , known as the pyroelectric effect  @xcite .",
    "both of these applications require a uniform orientation of the molecules .",
    "hence , the helix must be suppressed , or unwound , by an applied electric field or by boundary effects .",
    "helix unwinding has been modeled through continuum elastic theory . in a bulk",
    "smc * phase , unwinding induced by an applied electric field can be described by the sine - gordon equation , presented below  @xcite . under an electric field ,",
    "the helix distorts and the helical pitch increases .",
    "if the field is increased above a critical threshold , the pitch diverges and the helix is suppressed . by contrast ,",
    "helix unwinding induced by boundary effects in a narrow cell is more complex  @xcite . in this case",
    ", a helix must have a series of disclination lines near the cell surfaces , which separate a twisted interior region from a uniform surface region .",
    "continuum elastic theory shows that the unwinding transition is controlled by an energetic competition between the helical state with disclinations and the uniform untwisted state . if the cell thickness is below a critical threshold comparable to the helical pitch , the uniform state is favored and the helix is suppressed . (",
    "a third possible mechanism for helix unwinding is shear flow  @xcite , but this is not often used in smc * liquid crystals , and we will not discuss it here . )    in this paper , we investigate the unwinding of a smc * helix by boundary effects , or by combined boundary and electric - field effects , through a series of monte carlo simulations of a continuum free energy discretized on a 2d lattice .",
    "these simulations serve two purposes .",
    "first , they allow us to visualize the complex director configuration within a narrow cell as a function of cell thickness and electric field .",
    "we obtain snapshots of the molecular tilt profile through the helix unwinding process .",
    "second , they allow us to relate the microscopic director configuration to two macroscopic variables , an average chiral order parameter and the net electrostatic polarization of the cell . the latter variable can be compared with experimental measurements of smc * cells .    in these simulations , we first consider boundary effects alone .",
    "we simulate the smc * phase in narrow cells , and determine the structure of the helix as a function of cell thickness .",
    "we confirm that the helix unwinds at a threshold thickness approximately equal to the helical pitch , in agreement with continuum elastic theory .",
    "we then use the same monte carlo approach to simulate helix unwinding due to the combined effects of cell boundaries and electric field . in these simulations , we calculate both the molecular tilt profile across the cell and the net electrostatic polarization . we observe three distinct regimes of response , in which the helical pitch is first distorted and then expelled as the applied field is increased . by varying the cell thickness ,",
    "we determine how boundary effects shift the critical field for helix unwinding and lower the saturation polarization .",

    "the molecular tilt is conventionally described in terms of the projection of @xmath1 into the layer plane , @xmath5 .    in this geometry , we expect the director to depend on the @xmath0 and @xmath6 coordinates .",
    "the @xmath6 coordinate is along the smectic layer normal . because of the molecular chirality",
    ", the molecular orientation rotates in a helix from layer to layer , which makes the director a periodic function of @xmath6 .",

    "the molecules may interact strongly with the front and back surfaces of the cell , at @xmath9 and @xmath7 . as a result ,",

    "the free energy density simplifies to @xmath29 in the limit of zero electric field , @xmath25 , we minimize this free energy over @xmath4 to obtain @xmath30 hence , the azimuthal angle increases linearly as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , as shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ helix ] .",
    "this linear increase in @xmath4 implies a perfect sinusoidal helix in @xmath33 .",
    "this minimal model also predicts unwinding of the helix under an applied electric field .",
    "this behavior is analogous to the theory of meyer for a cholesteric phase in an electric or magnetic field  @xcite . for @xmath34 , minimizing the free energy over @xmath4 gives @xmath35 this is the standard sine - gordon equation .",
    "the form of the solutions depends on the value of @xmath26 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ helix ] . for low @xmath26 ,",
    "the helix is distorted , so that the director is approximately aligned with the field in most of the system . as @xmath26 increases",
    ", the helix becomes even more distorted , with sharper steps between domains where @xmath4 is approximately a multiple of @xmath36 .",

    "[ geometry ] , the helical pitch is along the @xmath6 direction , but the narrow dimension of the cell is along the @xmath0 direction . because these directions are perpendicular , there is no simple geometric reason why a helix must unwind when the cell thickness is less than the pitch .",

    "an energetic argument has been developed for narrow cells of the cholesteric phase  @xcite , and has been extended to narrow cells of the smc * phase  @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "the argument can be stated as follows  @xcite .",
    "if a cell has a helix in the interior , but a uniform director along the front and back surfaces , then it must have a series of disclination lines running along the @xmath10 direction near the surfaces .",
    "there must be one disclination line for each helical pitch .",
    "we can compare the energy of the helix ( with disclinations ) with the energy of the uniform state to find the threshold thickness for helix unwinding .",
    "the energy of the helix ( with disclinations ) is the negative energy gained from the helix plus the positive energy lost to the disclinations , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the disclination line energy per unit length .",
    "the helix unwinds if @xmath43 , which implies @xmath44 since the line energy @xmath42 should be of order @xmath40 , the threshold thickness should be comparable to the pitch .    in the following sections , we test this argument through a series of monte carlo simulations .",
    "in these simulations , we obtain snapshots of the director configuration for different cell thicknesses , both at zero field and under an applied electric field .",
    "these snapshots provide specific illustrations of the disclinations discussed above . for zero field ,",
    "the simulations confirm that the helix unwinds at a critical thickness approximately equal to the helical pitch . for finite field ,",
    "the simulations show helix unwinding induced by the combined effects of boundaries and electric field in a cell above the critical thickness . in both cases , we relate the microscopic snapshots of the director configuration to macroscopic variables . one of these variables , the net electrostatic polarization , can be compared with experimental measurements .",
    "to model helix unwinding in a finite cell of the smc * phase , we map the system onto a 2d square lattice .",
