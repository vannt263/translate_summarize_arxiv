    "higher - rank numerical ranges generalize the classical numerical range of a matrix , and arise as a special case of the matricial range for a matrix @xcite . in @xcite , three of us conjectured that the higher - rank numerical ranges of normal matrices depend , in a very precise way , on the spectral structure of the matrix .",
    "the conjecture reduces in the rank-1 case to a well - known property of the classical numerical range for a normal matrix , and it has opened the door to some interesting new mathematical problems . its verification ( or refutation ) would also yield information for quantum error correction .    in this paper",
    "we verify the higher - rank numerical range conjecture for a wide variety of unitary and normal matrices .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing a number of new geometric techniques into the analysis .",
    "we show in the case of a generic @xmath0 unitary with non - degenerate spectrum and positive integer @xmath1 with @xmath2 , that the @xmath3th numerical range is given by a certain polygon in the complex plane determined by the eigenvalues of the unitary , and thus verify the conjecture .",
    "in other cases , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we also verify the conjecture .",

    "a `` binary unitary channel '' @xcite @xmath6 is a noise model described by two unitary errors that can occur during the time evolution of a given quantum system .",
