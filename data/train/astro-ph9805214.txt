    "ic  4329a is a nearby ( @xmath5 ) , edge - on , s0 , type 1 seyfert galaxy , at a distance of 64mpc ( @xmath6 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) , situated very close to the centre of abell cluster a3574 .",
    "this is unusual given that seyfert galaxies , like most spirals , are rarely found inside clusters ( e.g. osterbrock @xcite ) .",
    "this cluster , first described by shapley ( @xcite ) , is often referred to as the ic  4329 cluster or group , after its brightest member ( e.g. de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or as klemola  27 ( klemola @xcite ) , and is the easternmost and most distant member of the chainlike hydra - centaurus supercluster ( chincarini & rood @xcite ) .",
    "the heavily reddened type  1 seyfert nucleus observed within ic  4329a ( winkler et al .",
    "@xcite ) is a strong fir / x - ray source , the 25@xmath7 peak in the _ iras _ flux density , suggestive of there being hot gas close to the nucleus .",
    "it has the steepest balmer decrement ( @xmath8 ) of any known seyfert , a very steep optical spectral index ( @xmath9 ) , and it is seen to show nai  in absorption ( penston & wilson @xcite ) . although calculated extinction values indicate that the absolute visual magnitude @xmath10 , is at least -23 , and may be as high as -25 , ic  4329a appears optically , to be a largely undisturbed edge - on system , with a prominent dust lane .    the brightest galaxy within the cluster , the giant lenticular ic  4329 has a redshift close to that of ic  4329a ( @xmath11 km s@xmath2 ) , and lies at a projected distance of 59kpc to the west . as pointed out by kollatschny & fricke ( @xcite ) , these two systems appear to be part of a loose group of seven galaxies , indicating that a number of the group member s activity may well be linked to past interactions .",
    "the fact that ic  4329 is a shell galaxy , together with the fact low surface brightness features are observed around ic  4329a ( wolstencroft et al.@xcite ) , suggest that an interaction is taking place between ic  4329 and ic  4329a .",
    "of the seven group members , only ic  4329a shows any indication of significant nuclear activity .",
    "further evidence for possibly interaction - induced activity is also apparent from emission - line imaging studies .",
    "a halo of emission - line gas can be seen around ic  4329a in the @xmath12[nii ] image of colbert et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , extending along the minor axis , @xmath1310  ( 3kpc ) on both sides of the nucleus , with a luminosity of @xmath14erg s@xmath2 .",
    "an almost identical image is seen in mulchaey et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this @xmath15 halo is believed by both sets of authors to represent an outflow from the nucleus , perhaps a superwind of the type commonly seen in edge - on infrared - luminous galaxies ( e.g. mccarthey et al .",
    "@xcite ; armus et al.@xcite ) .",
    "radio mapping of the ic  4329a system has brought about some very interesting results also . in a molonglo synthesis telescope ( most ) 843mhz survey of radio sources in southern abell clusters , ic",
    "4329a is seen to possess an apparent radio tail @xmath16  long ( unewisse @xcite ) , corresponding to a linear size of 110kpc .",
    "this feature implies a radio structure larger than any other known seyfert , though it must be stressed that the resolution of the most observations make it impossible to be certain whether the observed feature is associated with the galaxy or not .",
    "other significant radio observations include those of unger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) at 1490mhz ( and 4860mhz ) , where , besides a bright core being visible , an extended region of emission is observed extending @xmath16  towards ic  4329 .",
    "this feature may well be associated with the interaction .",
    "furthermore , blank & norris ( @xcite ) , in a 4  resolution 2.3ghz observation , observed two 10  extensions emanating from the nucleus .",
    "the first is roughly in the same direction as the extension seen by unger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . the second ,",
    "extending to the south - east , perpendicular to the dust - lane of the galaxy , may , according to blank & norris ( @xcite ) , be due to a superwind , driven from the nucleus .",
    "baum et al .  ( @xcite ) found that the kpc - scale radio emission seen in several seyfert galaxies tended to align itself with the systems minor axes , and they concluded that circumnuclear starbursts are the most likely cause .",
    "x - ray emission associated with ic  4329a was first suspected when ariel  v detected the steady source 2a  1347 - 300 ( cooke et al .",
    "the error box however , contained ic  4329 as well , and it was only later ( delvaille @xcite ) that the source was identified with ic  4329a .",
    "further observations were performed by heao  1 , both in scanning ( piccinotti et al .",
    "@xcite ) and pointed modes ( tennant & mushotzky @xcite ; mushotzsky @xcite ) , and by heao  2 ( petre et al .",
    "ic  4329a and ic  4329 also appear in fabbiano et al.s ( @xcite ) x - ray catalog and atlas .",
    "ic  4329a has also been observed ( miyoshi et al .",
    "@xcite ) with gas scintillation proportional counters aboard the japanese satellite tenma ( tanaka @xcite ) .",
    "it had been established prior to this that large amplitude variabilities in the x - ray flux are rare within seyfert galaxies on timescales of seconds to years ( mushotzky @xcite ) , and indeed , no significant change in flux or spectral shape was seen over the six day tenma observation .",
    "the spectral shape above 15kev however , an almost flat , rather positively - sloped tail ( rare for seyfert  1 galaxies ) , appeared to be very different when compared to the heao  1 data ( mushotzky @xcite ) .",
    "observations of ic  4329a with _ ginga _ ( piro et al .",
    "@xcite ) showed a hard x - ray bump above 8kev , probably produced by absorption or reflection of the central emission by a very thick cold medium close to the nucleus , an idea supported by the detection of 6.4kev fluorescence lines .",
    "the _ rosat _  pspc data from ic  4329a have been published recently in conjunction with the _ compton gro _ observations ( madejski et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter m95 ) , their main result being that ic  4329a s spectrum is compatible with a single power law , of energy spectral index 1 , modified by absorption and reflection extending from soft x - rays to @xmath17-rays .",
    "what evidence there is of a @xmath17-ray spectral break is weak , and in any case , the energy of this possible break is both higher than that of ngc  4151 ( zdziarski et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and higher than that of typical seyfert 1s ( fabian et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the _ rosat _  spectrum of ic  4329 was also presented , it being well described by an optically thin thermal plasma with @xmath18kev . as far as the spatial structure obtained with the pspc",
    "is concerned , m95 describe ic  4329a s x - ray source as being consistent with point - like .",
    "_ asca _ observations of ic  4329a ( cappi et al .",
    "@xcite ) indicate that the 0.4@xmath1910kev spectrum is best described by a steep power law spectrum passing through a warm absorber , together with a strong reflection component and fe k line , confirming both the above _ rosat - gro _ ( m95 ) and separate",
    "( mushotzky et al .",
    "@xcite ) results . furthermore , as concluded by m95 , cold absorption in excess of the galactic value is required by the data , consistent with the edge - on nature of the galactic disc .",
    "the _ rosat _  x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) ( pfeffermann et al .",
    "@xcite ) at its focal plane , offers three very important improvements over previous x - ray imaging instruments ( such as the _ einstein _",
    "firstly , the spatial resolution is very much improved , the 90% enclosed energy radius at 1kev being @xmath20 ( hasinger et al .",
    "secondly , the pspc s spectral resolution is very much better ( @xmath21 fwhm at 1kev ) than earlier x - ray imaging instruments , allowing the derivation of characteristic source and diffuse emission temperatures .",
    "lastly , the pspc internal background is very low ( @xmath22ct s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath23 ; snowden et al .",
    "@xcite ) , thus allowing the mapping of low surface brightness emission .",
    "the high resolution imager ( hri ) on the other hand , because of its excellent spatial resolution ( more like @xmath24 ) and relative insensitivity to diffuse emission , is an ideal instrument for further investigation into the point source populations ( see trmper ( @xcite ) for a description of the _ rosat _  satellite and instruments ) .    here",
    "we report the results of a 15.5ks _ rosat _  high resolution imager ( hri ) observation that addresses one essential aspect of the x - ray emission from ic  4329a and its neighbours that has not been possible until now @xmath19 that of the high resolution spatial properties of the x - ray emission .",
    "although , as mentioned above , some aspects of the pspc data have been published ( m95 ) , the authors concentrate almost entirely on the spectral properties of the individual systems , and no discussion of the spatial properties is given . we have therefore performed a thorough reanaysis of the 8.3ks of _ rosat _  pspc data , concentrating on the spatial properties and on the existence of any extended features .",
    "these results are also presented here .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "sect.[sec_obs_data ] describes the observation and the preliminary data reduction methods used , sect.[sec_disc_sources ] discusses the results as regards the point source emission , sect.[sec_disc_unres ] discusses the results as regards the remaining unresolved emission , and finally a summary is presented in sect.[sec_summary ] .",
    "the field surrounding ic  4329a was observed with the _ rosat _  hri on the 14th of january 1995 in essentially two separate observations for a total 15.5ks .",
    "the data appeared essentially very clean , and only 200 seconds of data were removed on the basis of very high ( @xmath25ct s@xmath2 ) and very low ( @xmath26ct s@xmath2 ) count rates , and on large values of atomic oxygen column density along the line of sight .",
    "source detection and position determination were performed over the full field of view ( @xmath27  diameter ) with the exsas local detect , map detect , and maximum likelihood algorithms ( zimmermann et al .",
    "images of pixel size 5  were used for the source detection . during the source detection procedure , only events detected in the raw hri channels 2@xmath198 were used , thus reducing the uv / cosmic ray background .",
    "sources accepted as detections were those with a likelihood l @xmath288 , and this gave rise to a number of sources .",
    "probabilities p , are related to maximum likelihood values l , by the relation p@xmath29 .",
    "thus a likelihood l of 8 corresponds to a gaussian significance of 3.6@xmath30 ( cruddace et al .",
    "@xcite ; zimmermann et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the source searching algorithms had difficulty in reliably detecting sources close to the bright central feature .",
    "sources that were ` detected ' here generally appeared to be extended ( i.e. they had a large value of extension likelihood ) , while possessing only a small number of counts .",
    "this is very suggestive of them being merely spurious features situated in the wings of the bright central feature .",
    "these sources were excluded from the analysis , leaving the 17 listed in table  [ table_srclist_hri ] .    in an effort to improve the accuracy of the hri source positions ,",
    "the ra and dec of five bright sources ( h2 , h7 , h15 , h16 and h17 ) were compared with the apm finding charts of irwin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the sources associated with the two central galaxies ic  4329a ( h11 ) and ic  4329 ( h5 ) , although they appeared to be very coincident , were not used in the re - aligning process , because of the extended nature of both their optical and x - ray emission .",
    "a very small offset of 0.10  in right ascension and 2.1  in declination is observed .",
    "table  [ table_srclist_hri ] lists the 17 detected hri sources as follows : source number ( col.1 , prefixed by a ` h ' to distinguish from pspc - detected sources , see sect.[sec_pspc ] ) , corrected right ascension and declination ( cols.2 and 3 ) , error on the source position ( col.4 , including a 3.9systematic attitude solution error ) , likelihood of existence ( col.5 ) , net counts and error ( col.6 ) count rates and errors after applying deadtime and vignetting corrections ( col.7 ) , and 0.1@xmath192.4kev flux , assuming a 5kev thermal bremsstrahlung model ( col.8 ) .",

    "the layout of the figures is such that the coincident sources appear at the same position ( hence h2 and h4 being coincident with p6 ) .",
    "the results of the timing analysis for ic  4329a are shown in fig.6 ( both hri and pspc ) .",
    "note that we are here interested in _ variations _ in the count rate from these sources , and not in the absolute values of these count rates , as these have been calculated earlier ( table  3 ) .",
    "hence we have been able to use small cut radii to avoid contamination from neighbouring sources and concentrate at the very centres of each source .",
    "differences in the calculated count rates between these two methods appear to be negligible , except in the hri cases involving the very bright , extended sources , where reductions in count rate , from those given in table  3 , can be seen .",
    "this is to be expected , given the methods involved .",
    "it appears that little in the way of any temporal variability exists for any of the bright sources ( including that associated with ic  4329a ) , and this is borne out by fitting the light curves to constant flux values .",
    "lightcurve h2 , in fact , shows the largest deviation from consistency , a constant flux level fitting the data with a reduced @xmath49 of 2.6 .",
    "the h2 lightcurve therefore is variable only at the 2.1@xmath30 significance level ( or at likelihood of 3.42 ) .",
    "thus no significant variability is observed within any of the detected sources .",
    "what is very evident from fig.3 is that there appears to be a great deal of unresolved emission enveloping the sources associated with the two central galaxies , ic  4329a ( p10 ) and ic  4329 ( p8 ) .",
    "as seen earlier , this is not seen at first with the hri ( fig.1 ) , though becomes strikingly clear when an adaptive filtering technique is applied ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the fact that this emission is very obvious in the unfiltered pspc data , though this fact is not mentioned in m95 , is very encouraging , and to investigate this aspect of the x - ray emission further , a similar filtering technique was applied to the pspc data .",
    "an image ( of pixel size 15 , and over the broad 11 - 235 range ) was formed , and sections of the image were smoothed using progressively larger gaussians for lower intensity pixels .",
    "pixels of amplitude 1 ( 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 ) were smoothed with a gaussian of fwhm 320  ( 225,160,115,80,55,40,30 ) .",
    "again , pixels of amplitude greater than 8 remained unsmoothed , to ensure that the bright point sources were not smoothed into the background .",
    "the resultant image is shown in fig.9 . again , as in the adaptively smoothed hri image , a great deal of unresolved emission is apparent , extending to a much greater radius than is seen in the equivalent hri image ( 9  compared to 5 ) .",
    "this is not too surprising , even taking into account the factor of @xmath69 deficit in exposure times , as the pspc is far more sensitive to low surface brightness diffuse emission than the hri .    as the pspc has some spectral resolution , we are able to investigate the spectral properties of this unresolved emission .",
    "what was immediately apparent though , before any rigorous spectral fitting ( as described later ) was performed , was that this unresolved emission appeared markedly two - component .",
    "it was decided at first to investigate the spatial properties of these two components , to try and ascertain their distributions .",
    "the three bright sources visible in the ic  4329a field are all especially interesting .",
    "h1-p3 is bright , shows marginal evidence for extension in the pspc ( though the fact that no evidence for extension is seen in the hri data implies that the source is truly unresolved ) and appears associated with a quite bright ( b magnitude = 16.5 ) star - like object , some 2.9  distant .",
    "h5-p6 is also very bright , appears to be significantly extended ( both in the pspc and hri data ) , and is associated with the giant elliptical galaxy ic  4329 . finally , h11-p8 is extremely bright , showing a great deal of structure , and is undoubtedly due to the seyfert galaxy , ic  4329a .",
    "it is worth noting again here that an analysis of the pspc data ( in conjunction with _",
    "compton gro observations _ ) has already been published by madejski et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( m95 ) .",
    "they deal however , almost exclusively with the spectral properties of ic4329a ( plus those of ic  4329 and h1-p3 , or as they call it , s3 ) , and so , in the discussion that follows , many of the results we present have not been addressed by m95 , and are new , though we do compare the results of our spectral analysis with those of m95 .    as in m95 , spectra of all three bright objects ( ic  4329a , ic  4329 and h1-p3 ) were analysed .",
    "spectra were extracted for all three objects from within circles of 1.7  ( for ic  4329a and ic  4329 ) and 3  ( for h1-p3 ) at the position of each source ( we note that an extraction radius of 3  for ic  4329a , as used in m95 , is likely to be too large , given that this is approximately the distance between ic  4329a and ic  4329 ) .",
    "background spectra were extracted as follows : for ic  4329a , from an annulus 6.6  to 9.1  from ic  4329a , thus avoiding contamination from any other bright features ; for ic  4329 , from a 1.7  radius circle situated equidistant , on the opposite side of ic  4329a , thus ensuring that contamination from the very bright central source could be removed ; and for h1-p3 , from a 3  to 5.5  annulus centred on h1-p3 , again avoiding any bright features .",
    "the three background - subtracted spectra , once corrected for exposure and vignetting effects , were fitted with standard spectral models ( thermal bremsstrahlung , power law , blackbody and raymond & smith ( @xcite ) hot plasma models ) .",
    "a number of extra , more complex models have been attempted as regards the ic  4329a spectrum , as in m95 , and the results of all the best fits are given below in table  [ table_fits_sources ] as follows : source ( col.1 ) , spectral model ( whether pl - power law plus absorption , bb - blackbody plus absorption , pl / e - power law plus absorption and an edge , rs raymond & smith hot plasma plus absorption ) ( col.2 ) , fitted @xmath50 ( col.3 ) , fitted spectral index @xmath51 , where @xmath52 ( col.4 ) , fitted temperature ( kt , in kev ) ( col.5 ) ( note here that in the case of the pl / e model , this column gives the edge energy in kev ) . the next columns give the metallicity ( solar , where an ` f ' indicates that the value has been frozen ) ( col.6 ) , the reduced @xmath53 ( col.7 ) , and three values of the ( 0.1@xmath192.4kev ) luminosity ( cols.8 - 10 ) .",

    "the final luminosity column ( col.10 ) gives the intrinsic ( 0.1@xmath192.4kev ) luminosity , using the count rate observed with the hri , and calculating the fluxes , assuming identical spectral models as inferred from the pspc data .",

    "the positioning of these two sources with respect to the central bright galaxy , ic  4329a , is both unusual and intriguing .    on july 6 , 1997 , during an observing campaign at the 2.2 m eso / mpg telescope at la silla observatory",
    ", we obtained spectra of these optical candidates using the efosc2 spectrograph with grism # 4 , a 2-wide long slit and the @xmath65 @xmath66 loral ccd .",

    "the seeing was typically 1.5 \" .",
    "the data were reduced according to the procedure given in pietsch et al.(@xcite ) .    through these optical observations ,",
    "we have established that all three sources have nothing at all to do with ic  4329a , and are in fact galactic foreground or background objects .",
    "sources h2 and h4 to the south - west , when compared with jacoby et al.s ( @xcite ) library of stellar spectra , appear to be foreground stars of types g3  v and m5  v respectively .",
    "furthermore , the north - eastern source looks to be a background quasar with a redshift of @xmath67 .",

    "firstly , it extends not only to the south - east , as the soft component does , but also to the north - west , and appears roughly circular in nature .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the soft component , it appears rather uniform and smooth , with little in the way of substructure .",
    "interestingly , and as discussed later , the hard component is not centred on ic  4329a , but instead appears to be centred somewhere between the ic  4329a / ic  4329 pair . also of note",
    "is the fact that this emission is seen to envelope two further galaxies within the galaxy group mentioned in the introduction .",

    "structure in the unresolved emission is evident also in the hri data .",
    "fig.11 shows contours of hri x - ray emission superimposed on an optical image of the two central galaxies .",

    "secondly , with regard to the emission surrounding ic  4329a , there appears to be an elongation along the disc , pointing towards the two outlying sources , one of which , h2/4-p4 , can be seen at the bottom - right of fig.11 .",

    "lastly , as regards ic  4329 , the curious spiral - arm - like structure to the x - ray emission is very intriguing .    1.0 cm      it appears therefore , that the unresolved emission within the ic  4329a / ic  4329 system is two - component , and this two component nature varies across the system , the area to the north - west of the ic  4329a disc being hard , the area to the south - east , being hard also , but with a very significant soft component contribution .",
    "this north - west / south - east divide was used to investigate the spectral properties of the unresolved emission .",
    "several unresolved emission spectra were extracted , both from the north - west ( nw ) and the south - east ( se ) side , a line through the centre of ic  4329a , at an angle ( anticlockwise from north ) of 56@xmath70 ( so that it approximately followed both the ic  4329a disc and the line joining the two outlying sources to ic  4329a ) , used to separate the two halves .",
    "two main spectra ( nw and se ) were extracted from half - annuli centred on ic 4329a , with inner radii of 2.25and outer radii of 11.7 , and were binned to give a signal - to - noise ratio of approximately six in each channel .",
    "these two spectra were each further subdivided into three concentrically - extracted spectra , with inner and outer radii of 2.25@xmath195  ( nw1 and sw1 ) , 5@xmath198.25  ( nw2 and sw2 ) and 8.25@xmath1911.7  ( nw3 and sw3 ) .",
    "these six sub - spectra were each binned to give a signal - to - noise ratio of approximately five in each channel . in the extraction of each of these 8 total spectra ,",

    "once these spectra were corrected for background and exposure time , it was possible to gauge the soft and hard - band contributions within each area . in the north - west ,",
    "the percentage of counts in the soft ( 0.1@xmath190.5kev ) band , compared to the total ( 0.1@xmath192.4kev ) number of counts , is seen to be low ( @xmath71% ) and constant ( to within @xmath72% ) for each of the three spectra ( nw1 , nw2 , nw3 ) . in the south - east however , the soft band contribution is seen to rise sharply from 19.7% for the inner - extracted spectrum ( se1 ) , through 34.8% for se2 , to 53.6% for se3 .",
    "as in the fitting of the point source spectra , spectral models were fitted to these unresolved emission spectra .",

    "this was formed by firstly eliminating from an image all of the sources to very large radii ( 5@xmath41 the fwhm of the psf ) .",
    "this resulted in an image where approximately none of the unresolved , extended emission , visible in fig.9 , was included .",
    "a polynomial fit was then used to interpolate across the ` holes ' , and the image was then heavily smoothed ( with a gaussian of fwhm 9.4 ) . a radial profile of this image ( again centered on ic  4329a ) gives the indicated dotted line .",
    "the dash - dotted line indicates the level of the ` diffuse ' emission , the unresolved emission visible in fig.9 .",
    "this was formed by removing sources from an image to radii of twice the fwhm of the psf .",
    "a mask image was created in the same way with zero values at the positions of these holes , and values of unity everywhere else . a radial profile ( of binsize 36 )",
    "was formed from the source subtracted image , and this was normalized for the area lost in the ` holes ' , by dividing it by an equivalent profile of the mask image .",
    "1.0 cm    several features are evident within this figure .",
    "the central bright point source is very obvious , but also visible are the two other bright sources , the ic  4329 source ( h5-p6 ) , at @xmath953 , and h1-p3 , at @xmath9513.5 .",
    "the emission is seen to fall to the background level at large radii ( 9@xmath1918 ) , but there is a very notable deviation from this level closer in . between 4  and 9  ( and possibly up to 11 ) , the emission is seen to be significantly enhanced with respect to the background , and there appears to be two components to this enhancement .",
    "one is the presence of some underlying , unresolved , perhaps truly diffuse emission , as indicated by the dash - dotted line .",
    "the second is the presence of point sources , notably the bright sources p6 , p9 and p16 , visible in the radial profile figure , between 4.5  and 6.5 , as data points lying above the residual emission profile . part ( or perhaps all ) of the enhancement at @xmath96  is due to sources p3 and p4 .    with regard to the unresolved emission therefore , it is the dash - dotted , unresolved emission profile , and the possible contribution to this from the dashed ic  4329a point source that are of interest .",
    "it can be seen from fig.14 that the idealised point source model of ic  4329a does contribute to the unresolved emission within the inner annulus ( nw1 & se1 : 2.25@xmath195 ) , though beyond this , in the outlying regions , the expected contribution drops rather quickly .",
    "the fact that the x - ray source associated with ic  4329a may not be an idealised point source however , as is suggested by fig.14 , where some deviation from the ( spectrally corrected ) point source psf model can be seen ) , may boost the true wing contribution in the outlying regions from this source , to values perhaps in line with that of the residual emission .",
    "perhaps therefore , the hard residual emission _ is _ due to the wings of ic  4329a .",
    "the hard residual emission is well fit by the ic  4329a spectrum , and the number of counts expected from the ic  4329a wings may be close to being in agreement with what is observed ( though this is unlikely ) .",
    "furthermore , the hard residual emission appears approximately circular , and both smooth and regular , as one would expect , if this emission were just due to the wings of a bright point source .",
    "unfortunately , there is one aspect of the hard residual x - ray emission that is very difficult to reconcile with it being due to the ic  4329a wings @xmath19 the emission is _ not _ centred on ic  4329a .",
    "instead , it appears centred on a point midway between ic  4329a and its bright elliptical companion , ic  4329 , a point coincident with the ` bridge ' of x - ray emission visible in the hri data ( fig.11 ) .",
    "this fact , that the emission is not centred on ic  4329a , makes it very unlikely that the hard residual emission is due entirely to the ic  4329a wings .    instead , the above points are very suggestive of the emission being due partly to the ` wings ' of ic  4329a , and partly to hot gas surrounding the ic  4329a / ic  4329 pair",
    ". a significant fraction of the hard residual emission will be due to the ic  4329a wings , but this only makes a marked contribution at smaller radii , dropping to a level below half that of the total hard residual emission beyond @xmath97 .",
    "the fact that the spectral properties of the hard residual emission appear indistinguishable from those of ic  4329a may at first seem strangely coincidental .",
    "in fact , this is not too surprising as the spectral capabilities of the _ rosat _  pspc are not too good for harder spectra , and , to the pspc , an ic  4329a - type spectrum and a hot ( 5@xmath1910kev ) plasma spectrum appear almost identical , as is apparent in the spectral fitting results ( table  [ table_fits_nw ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have attempted to further analyse the north - western unresolved emission spectra , in an attempt to extract any information regarding the hot gas component that may exist .",
    "a two - component model , comprising of a power - law component , representing the emission from the ic  4329a ` wings ' , and a raymond and smith hot plasma component , representing the diffuse hot gas component , was fitted to the full nw spectrum and to the three sub - spectra nw1 , nw2 and nw3 . here",
    ", the power - law component parameters were frozen at the ic  4329a values ( @xmath98cm@xmath23 , @xmath99 ) , and the raymond & smith component absorption column was frozen at the galactic value ( @xmath100cm@xmath23 ) .",
    "examination of the resultant raymond & smith component normalization - temperature parameter space reveals a similar effect in all but one of the cases ; in the fits to the full nw spectrum , and to the inner nw1 and the outer nw3 spectrum , the temperature of the hot gas component is seen to be very ill - defined , with large , and highly irregularly - shaped confidence contour levels .",
    "furthermore , no significant improvements in the fit quality are seen , reduced @xmath53s ( and number of degrees of freedom ) for these three fits being : nw 0.86(9 ) , nw1 0.63(5 ) nw3 0.30(3 ) ( compare these values with the one - component raymond and smith values given in table  [ table_fits_nw ] ) .    in the case of the nw2 spectrum",
    "however , a significant improvement is seen in the fit quality ( reduced @xmath53(n.d.o.f ) @xmath101 @xmath19 compare with table  [ table_fits_nw ] ) .",
    "also the hot gas component normalization - temperature parameter space is seen to be quite well - defined , with ( at least at the 68% confidence level ) reasonably small and regularly - shaped contour levels ( see fig.15 ) .",
    "the best fit to the nw2 spectrum ( indicated by the dot in fig.15 ) contains a ic  4329a - like component and a hot gas component with a temperature of 1.53@xmath102kev .",
    "we believe that we are only able to see this hot gas component , even reasonably , within the nw2 fit , because it is only at this radial distance from the central bright source that the contamination from the ic  4329a ` wings ' drops sufficiently enough to allow the hot - gas component ( which is itself dropping with radius ) to become visible . in the nw1 spectrum , although the hot gas component is large , the ic  4329a wing component is huge , and the contamination is too large to allow a reasonable determination of the hot gas component parameters . in the nw3 spectrum , even though the ic  4329a wing component has become extremely low , the hot gas component is now very low itself , and the statistics involved are insufficient for a reasonable spectral determination .",
    "a great range in temperature is able to fit the hot gas component of the full nw spectrum .",
    "we assume here though , that the temperature of the entire hot gas component is equal to the temperature found for the nw2 spectrum ( 1.53@xmath102kev ) .",
    "fitting of the full nw spectrum , assuming this temperature , does lead to a very good fit indeed , with a reduced @xmath53 of 0.52 ( with 10 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "1.0 cm    mean physical properties for this north - western hot gas can be inferred from the above results if we make some assumptions about the geometry of the emission .",
    "here we have assumed the simple geometry of the north - western hot gaseous emission being hemispherical with a radius of 11.7  ( in actuality , only a rough approximation to the gas properties can be calculated here and assumption of a slightly different radius gives rise to very similar results ) .    using the volume derived for this hemispherical ` bubble ' model , the fitted emission measure @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 is the ` filling factor '  the fraction of the total volume @xmath105 which is occupied by the emitting gas ) can be used to infer the mean electron density , @xmath106 , and hence the total mass @xmath107 , thermal energy @xmath108 and cooling time @xmath109 of the gas .    performing these calculations , after first accounting for the extra emission lost in the ` holes ' left after the source - subtraction procedure , one arrives at approximate values to the physical properties of the north - western hot gaseous emission as follows ; x - ray luminosity @xmath110 ( 0.1@xmath192.4kev ; intrinsic ) 2.6@xmath61erg s@xmath2 ; @xmath106 , 1.8@xmath111@xmath112 ; @xmath113 , @xmath114 @xmath115 ; @xmath108 , 8.1@xmath116erg ; @xmath117 , 99gyr .",
    "in the later discussion , we will see that no spectral information regarding the hot gaseous emission to the south - east can be obtained .",
    "this is primarily because of this emission being severely contaminated , not only , as it is to the north - west , by the ic  4329a ` wings ' , but also by the very soft emission discussed earlier . if one makes the simple assumption that the properties of the hot gas to the south - east are identical to those to the north - west , a quite valid assumption , given the physical appearance of the emission and the level of accuracy we can attain , then the values of the physical properties for the total hot gas surrounding the ic  4329a / ic  4329 system become double those quoted above ( except for the mean electron density @xmath106 , and the cooling time @xmath117 , which remain unchanged ) .    remembering that , as discussed in the introduction , the two central galaxies lie close to cluster a3574 , and are part of a loosish group of seven galaxies , it is useful to compare here the properties of this hot gaseous emission component with the general x - ray properties of groups and clusters .",
    "as regards the comparison with clusters , though the temperature of the hot gas may be comparable , the luminosity ( @xmath118erg s@xmath2 ) is extremely low .",
    "clusters typically have x - ray luminosities greater than @xmath119erg s@xmath2 ( edge & stewart @xcite ; yamashita @xcite ; white @xcite ) , i.e. two orders of magnitude greater than is observed around ic  4329a / ic  4329 , and it is therefore very unlikely that we are seeing emission associated with the a3574 cluster . in the following discussion , we will primarily deal with the comparison of the present results with the properties of galaxy groups .    the general x - ray properties of galaxy groups have recently been published , both of hickson s ( @xcite ) compact groups ( hcgs ) ( ponman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and of other , poor groups ( mulchaey et al .  @xcite ) .",

    "a good optical image of the group can be found in fricke & kollatschny ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the hot gaseous emission is low , but in no way uncomfortably low when compared to the results of ponman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and mulchaey et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "many other galaxy groups at the same distance are seen with very similar hot gas x - ray luminosities ( i.e. the emission from the member galaxies having been removed , as has been done here ) .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the diffuse hot gas x - ray luminosity to the total blue luminosity of the member galaxies @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) is seen to be very typical of groups .",
    "as regards how the x - ray luminosity relates to the spiral fraction ( the fraction of the group member galaxies that are spiral , as opposed to elliptical galaxies ) , the hot gas around ic  4329a / ic4329 is again , in no way unusual .",
    "the spiral fraction of the ic  4329a group is actually very high , ic  4329 being the only non - spiral member , and though ponman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find only a very weak correlation between spiral fraction and @xmath110 , mulchaey et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find a somewhat stronger correlation , all of the groups they detect having an extended x - ray emitting intragroup medium having a high percentage of early - type galaxies .",
    "the emission within the ic  4329a group ( a high spiral fraction group ) is of a low luminosity , in agreement with the work of mulchaey et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( and of ponman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) though only a far weaker correlation is seen here ) .",
    "as regards the temperature of this hot gas however the emission may be unusual .",
    "as discussed earlier , it has proved very difficult to separate this emission from the wings of the bright central source associated with ic  4329a , and a good deal of caution should be taken here .",
    "indeed , the present case is very similar to the case of hgc  4 , as , while saracco & ciliegi ( @xcite ) suggest the existence of an extended component , pildis et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find that it is impossible to detect any extended diffuse component on account of the emission from the central active galaxy in the group being so strong .",
    "our tentative value though , for the temperature of the hot gas ( @xmath122kev ) appears to be high when compared to the values of ponman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which range , in the majority of cases , from 0.6@xmath191kev , and also when compared to the values of mulchaey et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "though a large error on the temperature does exist ( see fig.15 ) , it does appear that the temperature is constrained to be greater than 1kev .",
    "the hot gaseous emission seen surrounding the ic  4329a / ic  4329 pair appears therefore , to be quite hot when compared to typical groups , and as such , it sits rather uncomfortably on the @xmath123temperature relationship of ponman et al.(@xcite ) , being of too low a luminosity for its temperature ( or too hot for its @xmath110 ) .    for rich clusters of galaxies ( edge & stewart @xcite )",
    ", there appears to be a good correlation between @xmath110 and the optical velocity dispersion @xmath30 . extending the edge & stewart ( @xcite ) cluster relationship down",
    ", one would expect , in the case of groups , the higher velocity dispersion systems to have higher x - ray luminosities , and indeed , this does appear to be the case ( ponman et al .",
    "@xcite ; mulchaey et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; higher-@xmath30 groups are brighter in x - rays",
    ". the ic  4329a group of galaxies has a rather large value of @xmath30 , approximately 390 km s@xmath2 , calculated using the galaxy - corrected recession velocities given in the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "this value is greater ( though within the range of ) hickson et al.s ( @xcite ) study of 100 hcgs , which have a median value of 200 km s@xmath2 .",
    "it is also larger than typical values for loose groups ( 208 km s@xmath2 geller & huchra @xcite ; 183 km s@xmath2 maia et al .",
    "@xcite ) , though much less than for rich clusters , where , for example , zabludoff et al .  ( @xcite ) established a median @xmath30 for 65 abell clusters , of 744 km s@xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , there is good indication of a correlation between @xmath30 and the group emission temperature ( ponman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a correlation which appears to extend from the poorest of groups to the richest of clusters . ic  4329a , on account of its high temperature _ and _ its high velocity dispersion , lies directly on ponman et al.s ( @xcite ) @xmath124 regression line , between the groups and the clusters . the hot gaseous emission within the ic  4329a group however , is not as x - ray luminous as the group s",
    "velocity dispersion would imply , and it lies below the regression line fitted to the @xmath125 data of ponman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed however , that it does lie well within the scatter of the data , and can not be called in any way , unusual .    in terms of the amount of gas present ,",
    "the ic  4329a group appears again , quite normal .",
    "its estimated gas mass of @xmath126 is very typical of groups ( mulchaey et al .",
    "@xcite ) , lying on the low side of average , but well within the scatter .    in summary then , part of the emission detected surrounding ic  4329a and ic  4329 , and extending out to two other galaxies in the group , ic  4327 and ngc  5298 , may well be hot gaseous emission associated with the galaxy group .",
    "if it is , then the estimated temperature of the hot gas ( @xmath127kev , quite hot for groups ) agrees well with the ( high ) velocity dispersion of the group galaxies .",
    "its x - ray luminosity however , appears to be lower than average ( for its velocity dispersion and/or temperature ) .",
    "similarly , the mass of gas involved is perhaps lower than average . in no way",
    "though , do any of the physical properties of the emission indicate that this ic  4329a group emission is very unusual .",
    "interestingly , the single galaxy group in ponman et al.s ( @xcite ) survey most similar to the ic  4329a group is hcg  48 .",
    "this group has a high velocity dispersion as well , and a correspondingly high temperature ( @xmath128kev ) is found for the hot gas .",
    "it s x - ray luminosity however , is low , and it is seen to lie significantly below the @xmath110-temperature relationship of ponman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , as do the present ic  4329a group results .",
    "importantly , like the ic  4329a group , hcg  48 itself lies within a larger cluster , a1060 , and it appears to be falling into this cluster . it may well be the case that we are seeing in both cases , the hcg  48 case and the ic  4329a case , the effects of gas stripping from these groups , as they fall through their respective clusters centres .",
    "this reduction in hot group gas would have the effect of reducing the observed @xmath110 ( and estimated gas mass ) , as is observed .",
    "the soft residual component reveals itself in several different ways .",
    "it can be seen in the soft band ( ch .  8@xmath1941 ) image of fig.3 , where the emission to the south - east of the central bright ic  4329a source is seen to be significantly enhanced with respect to the emission to the north - west .",
    "the most striking depiction of the residual soft component however , is in fig.10 , where the adaptively filtered soft band image shows what appears to be a roughly semi - circular distribution of diffuse emission , ` centred ' on ic  4329a , and extending out , though almost entirely to the south - east , to a radius of perhaps 10 , past the two outlying sources h2/4-p4 and h16-p12 .",
    "as seen , the spectral properties of this emission indicate that it is very likely to be due to a very low temperature ( @xmath129kev ) plasma , absorbed by a column consistent with that out of own galaxy .",
    "what is this soft emission then ?",
    "one question that needs to be addressed first is , is this feature actually associated with ic  4329a ? perhaps it is a foreground feature .",
    "perhaps it is very local , within our own galaxy , or even within our local bubble .",
    "the spectral information present in the pspc data is very useful here , as in fig.13 , where the 1@xmath30 , 2@xmath30 and 3@xmath30 gaussian contour levels in the soft - component temperature - absorption column parameter space are shown , it can be seen that this component s spectrum appears to be best fit with a plasma spectrum with an absorption column equal to , or greater than , the column out of the galaxy , i.e. the feature is very likely to be extragalactic , if no intrinsic absorption is present , a likely fact , given the amorphous , diffuse nature of the feature .",
    "the feature therefore , appears likely to be extragalactic .",
    "is it associated with ic  4329a though ?",
    "a couple of points regarding the structure of the feature are very suggestive , we believe , of this being the case .",
    "firstly , a good correlation is seen between this soft feature and the disc of ic  4329a .",
    "secondly , within this feature , a large plume of emission is visible lying directly perpendicular to the ic  4329a disc , to the south - east ( see fig.10 ) , i.e. along the galaxy s minor axis .",
    "this plume is in the same direction as the 2.3ghz radio feature discovered by blank & norris ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the hri image ( fig.11 ) shows good evidence for an extension in this south - eastern direction also .",
    "lastly , the soft feature , although lying almost exclusively to the south - east of ic  4329a , is very symmetric with respect to the minor axis of ic  4329a , i.e. the level of emission seen to the north - east of the plume discussed above appears very similar to that to the south - west .",
    "assuming therefore , that the emission is connected in some way to the ic  4329a / ic  4329 system , then the fact that it is soft and intrinsically , almost completely unabsorbed , is very reminiscent of the galactic winds seen within the halos of many different systems ( notably starburst systems ) ( watson et al .",
    "@xcite ; fabbiano @xcite ; pietsch @xcite ; strickland et al .",
    "@xcite ; read et al .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "many multi - wavelength studies of this system indicate that a wind is possibly present ( see sect.[sec_intro ] ) . both colbert et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and mulchaey et al .",
    "( @xcite ) detect @xmath12[nii ] features extending along the minor axis , to @xmath1310  ( 3kpc ) on both sides of the nucleus , and both sets of authors believe that these features represent an outflow from the nucleus similar to the superwinds commonly seen in edge - on infrared - luminous galaxies ( e.g. mccarthey et al .",
    "@xcite ; armus et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there are however , many differences between this feature and the ` classic ' winds seen in such nearby starburst systems as m82 and ngc  253 .",
    "firstly , the feature is very large , extending to a radius of perhaps 10 , which at the assumed distance of 64mpc , corresponds to a size of almost 200kpc .",
    "this is over an order of magnitude greater than the classic features mentioned above .",
    "secondly , it appears almost entirely on one side only of the system , to the south - east , and thirdly , it is rather luminous when compared to the classic starburst winds .    as for the hot gaseous emission in the previous section , mean physical properties for this cool",
    ", soft - component se gas can be inferred , if we make some assumptions about the geometry of the emission .",
    "we could consider the emission to be in the form of a hemisphere , purely in the south - eastern direction .",
    "this is physically unreasonable however , and upon closer inspection , the best simple estimate for the geometry of the soft residual emission appears to be a sphere , centred to the south of ic  4329a , with a radius of @xmath958(150kpc at the assumed distance of 64mpc ) .",
    "again , only a rough approximation to the gas properties can be calculated here and assumption of either model gives rise to very similar results .    using the volume derived for this spherical ` bubble ' model , the fitted emission measure @xmath103",
    "can again be used to infer the mean electron density , @xmath106 , the total mass @xmath113 , the thermal energy @xmath108 and the cooling time @xmath117 of the gas , as follows ; x - ray luminosity @xmath110 ( 0.1@xmath192.4kev ; intrinsic ) 8.7@xmath61erg s@xmath2 ; @xmath106 , 3.4@xmath111@xmath112 ; @xmath113 , @xmath130 @xmath115 ; @xmath108 , 7.0@xmath131erg ; @xmath117 , 2.6gyr .",
    "comparison of these values with values obtained for the soft extended features seen in several nearby spiral systems ( including the ` classic ' winds in ngc  253 , m82 , ngc  3079 and ngc  3628 ( read et al .",
    "@xcite ) ) , leads to the conclusion that the soft emission seen here , to the south - east of ngc  4329a , is even more unusual than at first thought . not only , as mentioned above , is it much larger and brighter ( both by at least an order of magnitude ) and observed on only one side of the system , but it appears to be far less dense ( again by over an order of magnitude ) , and extremely massive ( perhaps a hundred times moreso than for the ngc  253/m82 features ) .",
    "one must be careful here though , as a factor of @xmath132 is still involved in the above results , and this could have quite a large effect on the results .",
    "the soft feature seen here therefore , appears to be completely unlike the classic starburst winds ( except in terms of the temperature , which appears to be consistent with the classic wind temperatures ( read et al .",
    "@xcite ) . what this feature bears much more of a resemblance to , are the features seen associated with the ultraluminous far - infrared galaxies ( firgs ) arp  220 , ngc  2623 ( read & ponman @xcite ) and ngc  6240 ( fricke & papaderos @xcite ) .",
    "here , large , soft , outlying features are seen to one side , and one side only , of these high - luminosity systems , systems believed to be at the most energetic stage in the evolution of a merger between two galaxies , i.e. at the point where the nuclei of the two galaxies merge .",
    "however , the features seen in these systems , though more similar to the ic  4329a feature than the ` classic ' wind features , are , in some respects , still rather different . though they are spectrally soft ( @xmath133kev ) , and large ( @xmath134kpc ) , much larger than the ` classic ' wind features , they are still significantly smaller than the ic  4329a feature . furthermore ,",
    "though they are far brighter than the ` classic ' wind features , they still have luminosities perhaps an order of magnitude smaller than the ic  4329a feature .",
    "it must be borne in mind here though that , as mentioned previously , ic  4329a is a superluminous seyfert galaxy , with an x - ray luminosity some two orders of magnitude greater than that of arp  220 ( read & ponman @xcite ) . in this respect , the ic  4329a ` wind '",
    "feature makes up a far smaller fraction of the total x - ray luminosity than in any of the firgs or starbursts .",
    "the most striking similarity between the ic  4329a soft feature , and the firg soft features however , is perhaps the strangest facet of their emission @xmath19 their one - sided nature . why does the structure seen in ic  4329a",
    "appear only on one side of the system ?",
    "as regards the firgs , and as is discussed in read & ponman ( @xcite ) , the answer may lie in the fact that these systems are rapidly evolving .",
    "maclow & mccray ( @xcite ) numerically modelled the growth of superbubbles : large thin shells of cold gas surrounding a hot pressurized interior , - essentially a galactic wind , or at least , the progenitor of , in various stratified atmospheres .",
    "they discovered that superbubbles blow out of the hi  layer ( i.e. they depart from the ` snowplow ' phase and evolve into the ` blowout ' phase ) , and are then able to move out into the inter - galactic medium at velocities of several thousand km s@xmath2 ( see heckman et al .",
    "this , maclow & mccray ( @xcite ) find , occurs when the superbubbles have a radius of between one and two scaleheights .",
    "what they also find however , is that these bubbles will blow out on _ one side only _ of a disc galaxy if the bubble centres are more than 50@xmath1960pc from the centre of the disc of the galaxy .",
    "now , in a ( relatively ) non - evolving system , such as m82 or ngc  253 , the starburst is seen to be very symmetrically positioned with respect to the galactic disc , and bipolar structures are seen in the x - ray ( watson et al .",
    "@xcite ; fabbiano @xcite ; pietsch @xcite ; strickland et al .",
    "@xcite ; read et al .",
    "as discussed in read & ponman ( @xcite ) though , in the rapidly - evolving ultraluminous merging systems arp220 and ngc  2623 , the central burst is highly unlikely to be so centrally positioned with respect to the quickly - moving and highly distorted gaseous components , and the direction of steepest pressure gradient ( along which the bubble will most rapidly expand ) will now no longer be along both directions of the disc s minor axis ( as is the case in m82-type systems ) , but will be in just one direction ( as is predicted by maclow & mccray @xcite ) , hence the observed one - sided blowout .    in the present case",
    ", it appears unambiguous that some sort of interaction between ic  4329a and ic  4329 is taking place : both galaxies are close together and are part of a looser group of seven galaxies .",
    "ic  4329 appears to be a shell galaxy , a signature of interaction .",
    "photographic co - addition and contrast enhancement of four ukst iiia - j survey plates indicate the presence of low surface brightness features around ic  4329a ( wolstencroft et al .",
    "@xcite ) , again suggestive of an interaction . evidence for possible interaction - induced activity is also seen , as discussed earlier , in the @xmath12[nii ] studies of colbert et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and mulchaey et al .  ( @xcite ) , and in the radio studies of unger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and blank & norris ( @xcite ) .",
    "good evidence for an interaction is present also in the _ rosat _  hri data .",
    "as seen previously , fig.11 shows what appears to be a ` bridge ' of emission connecting the two galaxies .",
    "this type of feature is believed to have been seen in several different situations , though importantly , always in association with galaxies in the process of interacting .",
    "for instance , a near - identical feature is seen between the pair of interacting galaxies , ngc  3395/6 ( read & ponman @xcite ) , and at the contact region between the two galaxies making up the _ antennae _ system ( read & ponman @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a similar feature is seen within the galaxy group hcg  92 ( stefan s quintet ) ( pietsch et al .",
    "it is thought probable that all of these features , including the present hri feature between ic  4329a and ic  4329 , are due to shocks resulting from strong galaxy interactions .",
    "so , though there is very strong evidence of an interaction occurring between ic  4329a and ic  4329 , whether , as regards the above one - sided blowout discussion , this interaction is strong enough to displace the disc of ic  4329a with respect to the ` central ' wind source , is unclear .",
    "there is another possible explanation of this very soft emission related to the harder group emission discussed earlier .",
    "remember that the high velocity dispersion of the ic  4329a group galaxies and the high fitted temperature to the x - ray emitting gas should point to the x - ray emitting gas having a high luminosity .",
    "this is observed however , not to be the case , and it was suggested that ` stripping ' of some of the group gas as the group moves through the surrounding a3574 cluster medium may be taking place .",
    "this would result in a reduction in the x - ray luminosity and estimated mass of the group gas , as we see . as discussed earlier , this idea is given some credence by the fact that hcg  48 , a group very similar to the ic  4329a group in terms of its high velocity dispersion and high x - ray temperature , combined with a low x - ray luminosity ( ponman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , is also observed to be a group within a cluster ( a1060 ) , and is thought to be falling through the centre of the cluster .    could this soft emission , seen to the south - east of the ic  4329a / ic  4329 pair , be this stripped group gas ?",
    "the addition of the x - ray luminosity and gas mass of this soft component to the equivalent values for the harder ` group ' component would certainly push the total group gas @xmath110 and @xmath135 to values such that the entire properties of the ic  4329a group , taken as a whole , would appear completely normal and typical . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", this group lies at the easternmost edge of the hydra - centaurus supercluster .",
    "though no tangential velocities for these galaxies are obviously available , it could perhaps be safe to assume that the ic  4329a group would be moving tangentially in a general westward direction , towards the centre of this superstructure .",
    "any gas stripped from this group would appear to the east of the group , as is observed in the case of the very soft emission .    whether the temperature of this soft gas is consistent with this idea ,",
    "is difficult to say .",
    "one might have expected any stripped gas to be harder than its equivalent group emission , though it might be possible that compression has lead to cooling .",
    "in fact , the ( roughly ) estimated cooling time of this gas is fairly short ( less than 3gyr ) .",
    "this idea , though interesting , may not be correct however , as perhaps the same morphology should be seen in the case of the hard group emission . though this hard emission is severly contaminated by the ic  4329a wings , it does appear , on account of the fact that the total hard emission is centred someway between ic  4329a and ic  4329 , that the hard group emission lies more predominantly to the opposite side of ic  4329a than the soft emission .",
    "we have observed both the rosat hri and pspc data from fields centred on the edge - on , type  1 seyfert galaxy ic  4329a and its nearby companion , the giant lenticular ic  4329 .",
    "17 and 22 sources are detected respectively in the full hri and pspc fields of view , the brightest being associated with the two central galaxies and a further source to the south - west .",
    "many coincidences are seen in the two datasets and the nine most significant hri sources all have equivalent pspc counterparts .",
    "in addition to point source emission , unresolved residual emission is detected surrounding the ic  4329a / ic  4329 pair .",
    "this emission appears markedly two - component , with a smooth , circularly - distributed hard component , centred midway between the two central galaxies , and a more irregular , soft component , situated almost entirely to the south - east of ic  4329a .",
    "our findings with regard to the observed point - source and unresolved emission can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "an extremely bright ( @xmath136erg s@xmath2 ) source is detected associated with the central seyfert ic  4329a .",
    "its spectral properties are compatible with a single power - law ( @xmath3 ) , with a spectral break at 0.7kev , in very good agreement with previous authors work .",
    "two other very bright sources are detected associated with the nearby giant lenticular ic  4329 ( @xmath137erg s@xmath2 ) , and with a likely quasar to the south - west .",
    "fitting of standard spectral models to these source spectra again result in fits that agree well with previous authors work .",
    "many other bright sources are detected both in the hri and pspc fields of view , including three point - like sources , symmetrically positioned with respect to the disc of ic  4329a .",
    "optical follow - up observations of these sources with the 2.2 m eso / mpg telescope at la silla , chile , has established that they are nothing to do with the central seyfert , being merely foreground and background objects .      \\5 . in addition to the point sources ,",
    "residual emission is detected , both in the hri and in the pspc , surrounding the ic  4329a / ic  4329 pair .",
    "this emission appears markedly two - component , comprising of a hard , smooth , circularly - distributed component , centred somewhere between ic  4329a and ic  4329 , and a soft , irregular component , situated almost entirely to the south - east of the ic  4329a disc .",
    ". the hard component of the residual emission appears itself to be made up of two components .",
    "one of these is purely the ` wings ' of the extremely bright ic  4329a source , visible out to several arcminutes .",
    "the second component appears to be hot ( @xmath131.5kev ) diffuse gas , with a luminosity of @xmath138erg s@xmath2 and a mass of perhaps @xmath139@xmath115 .",
    "the properties of this emission are very suggestive of it being due to hot gas within the galaxy group of which ic  4329a and ic  4329 are members .",
    "the soft component of the residual emission , in terms of its temperature and one - sided nature , bears a good deal of resemblance to proposed starburst driven winds seen in some far - infrared ultraluminous systems .",
    "it is however much brighter ( @xmath140erg s@xmath2 ) , and larger .",
    "another possibility discussed briefly , is that the soft emission may be a ` wake ' of stripped gas from the galaxy group .",
    "a ` bridge - like ' feature is detected with the hri between the two central galaxies , and is likely , as is seen in other similar systems , to be due to shocks resulting from the strong interaction taking place between the two systems .",

    "<S> we report here the results of high - resolution and spectral imaging x - ray observations , with both the _ rosat _  hri and pspc , of the field surrounding the nearby ( @xmath0mpc ) type  1 seyfert galaxy ic  4329a and its giant lenticular companion ic  4329 . </S>",
    "<S> many point sources are detected , the brightest being associated with ic  4329a itself , having an extremely bright x - ray luminosity of @xmath1erg s@xmath2 , and spectral properties compatible with a single power - law model ( @xmath3 ) , with a spectral break at 0.7kev . </S>",
    "<S> two other bright sources are detected associated with the companion galaxy ic  4329 , and a likely quasar 14  to the south - west . </S>",
    "<S> we have also established , through optical observations taken at the european southern observatory , that three further x - ray point sources , intriguingly positioned with respect to ic  4329a , are in fact nothing to do with the system , and are merely foreground and background objects .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to point source emission , residual , unresolved emission is detected surrounding the ic  4329a/ ic  4329 pair , extending for some 200kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this emission appears markedly two - component , comprising of a spectrally hard and smooth component , circularly - distributed about the central galaxy pair , and a spectrally soft , more clumpy component , positioned almost entirely to the south - east of ic  4329a . </S>",
    "<S> the hard component of the residual emission itself appears two - component , one component being due to the ` wings ' of the intensely bright ic  4329a source , the other , apparently due to hot ( @xmath4kev ) gas , likely associated with the galaxy group of which ic  4329a and ic  4329 are members . </S>",
    "<S> the soft component of the residual emission may be a larger version of the superwinds seen around some ultraluminous far - infrared galaxies , or may even represent a ` stripped wake ' of intragroup gas . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for shocked gas due to the central ic  4329a/ ic4329 interaction is also found between the two central galaxies . </S>"
