    "as shown in appendix  [ appendix : analytic_pdc ] the exponential regularization gives @xmath59 , with the sign in agreement with experimental results .",

    "according to eqs .  ( [ eq : josephson2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : josephson1 ] ) , for an applied constant voltage bias , the phase - dependent dissipative current is oscillating and has zero average , and its amplitude is comparable to that of the josephson current only at very high frequencies ( @xmath65 ) , therefore its detection is difficult .",

    "physically , the internal memory degree of freedom that controls the conductance is the non - dissipative current that flows in the loop , since opposite currents with equal magnitude flow in the two junctions .",
    "this loop current has no preferred values since the critical currents of the junctions are strictly equal .",
    "on the other hand a critical current imbalance between the junctions introduces a potential term @xmath92 in the interferometer energy with @xmath93 and the zero - current state @xmath94 is favoured .",

    "in fact , in this limit the properties of the whole device , including the pdc , are essentially those of the jj with smaller superconducting gap , while the jj with larger gap only serves as a shunt of the josephson current @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , in order to construct a superconducting memristor , it is not necessary to achieve the same level of control on the parameters of both junctions , which is usually hard when different superconducting materials are employed .",

    ". therefore it should be possible to realize a superconducting memristor with junctions of the non - tunnel type which usually have higher transparency than tunnel junctions .",
    "increasing the barrier transparencies of jjs is expected to improve the performance of a superconducting memristor for several reasons : first , the pdc is of the same order of the leakage conductance which is increased by increasing the transparency . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : window ] ) the window of frequencies where the pdc dominates is widened with increasing the ratio @xmath74 .",
    "second , the critical current density increases as well with the transparency and this is desirable since the non - dissipative current flowing in the ca - squid loop is , in our proposal , the physical memory degree of freedom of the memristor , and the larger the current the less sensitive is the state of the memristor to thermal fluctuations . indeed",
    "the phase diffusion time scale defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluctuations ] is proportional to the critical current of the junctions @xmath193 .",
    "third , the capacitance of junctions with high transparency is generally small and they are over - damped even without a shunting resistor .",
    "this is the same kind of trend that has occurred with rsfq technology . in this case , due to the development of the fabrication technology of nb / alo / nb jjs used in rsfq circuits ,",
    "the barrier layer is so thin that transport is already dominated by multiple andreev reflections  @xcite , a regime of high transparency not captured by the tjm model .",
    "the problem of the existence of a finite pdc for jjs where transport is dominated by andreev reflections is an interesting question by itself .",
    "if a sizable pdc is present the use of this kind of junctions could improve the specifics of superconducting memristors .",
    "a possible problem though is that in non - tunnel junctions the current - phase relation can be different from sinusoidal , which is the case for jjs that are well described by second - order perturbation theory on the tunneling matrix elements , and this results in an imperfect cancellation of the total critical current of the interferometer .",
    "moreover , a general dynamical theory as informative as the tjm model  ( [ eq : tjm1])-([eq : tjm2 ] ) is not available for non - tunnel junctions .    our proposal , besides being interesting from a fundamental point of view , may find practical applications as well .",
    "it has been found recently that unconventional nanoscale devices that combine electrical and ionic transport are approximately governed by the defining equations of a memristor  [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : memristor1 ] ) ]  @xcite .",
    "this has stimulated the exploration of neuromorphic massively - parallel computing architectures  @xcite , whose speed and low - energy consumption for specific tasks promise to be unmatched even by the best available computers .",
    "superconducting memristors offer new venues for neuromorphic computation  @xcite and high - speed digital electronics since they can be readily integrated with existing rsfq circuits with clock frequencies up to hundreds of gigahertz  @xcite , combined with @xmath194 times lower power consumption than their semiconductor counterparts .",
    "the non - destructive readout protocol presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : nondestructive_readout ] may find applications in superconducting memories , a subject which is becoming increasingly actual  @xcite .",
    "the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_nm ] ) can be evaluated in closed form using the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind , respectively @xmath195 we provide only the first few that are relevant for our problem : @xmath196    these formulas are useful to evaluate the ratio @xmath197 between the pdc and the leakage conductance [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : josephson1 ] ) ] . using that @xmath198 and @xmath199 for @xmath200",
    ", one finds that @xmath201 .",
    "this result was derived with a frequency - domain approach in ref .",
    "@xcite . the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon ] shows in fact that the function @xmath202 does not change significantly in the relevant range @xmath203 . since the functions @xmath204 have the asymptotic behavior @xmath205 the integrals @xmath206 are ill defined .",
    "this means that the magnitude and sign of the pdc strongly depend on the kind of regularization used for the bcs result , which is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ip])-([eq : iq ] ) without the exponential factor .",
    "for example , with a different regularization used in ref .",
    "@xcite the result is @xmath207 .",
    "therefore microscopic details , that provide such regularization and that are difficult to account for quantitavely , can have a dramatic effect on the pdc .",
