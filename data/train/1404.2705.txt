    "in asymptotics exactification is defined as the process of obtaining the exact values of a function / integral from its complete asymptotic expansion and has already been achieved in two notable cases . for those unfamiliar with the concept ,",
    "a complete asymptotic expansion is defined as a power series expansion for a function or integral that not only possesses all the terms in a dominant asymptotic series , but also all the terms in frequently neglected subdominant or transcendental asymptotic series , should they exist .",
    "the latter series are said to lie beyond all orders , while the methods and theory behind them belong to the discipline or field now known as asymptotics beyond all orders or exponential asymptotics @xcite .",
    "one outcome of this relatively new field is that it seeks to obtain far more accurate values from the asymptotic expansions for functions / integrals than standard poincare@xmath1 asymptotics @xcite .",
    "these calculations , which often yield values that are accurate to more than twenty decimal places , are referred to as hyperasymptotic evaluations or hyperasymptotics , for short .",
    "hence , exactification represents the extreme of hyperasymptotics .    in the first successful case of exactification exact values of a particular case of the generalized euler - jacobi series , viz .",
    "@xmath2 , were evaluated from its the complete asymptotic expansion , which was given in powers of @xmath3 . although it had been found earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite that there could be more than one subdominant series in the complete asymptotic expansion for the generalized euler - jacobi series , the complete asymptotic expansion for @xmath4 was found to be composed of an infinite dominant algebraic series and another infinite exponentially - decaying asymptotic series , whose coefficients resembled those appearing in the asymptotic series for the airy function @xmath5 . in carrying out the exactification of this complete asymptotic expansion ,",
    "a range of values for @xmath3 was considered with the calculations performed to astonishing accuracy .",
    "this was necessary in order to observe the effect of the subdominant asymptotic series , which required in some instances that the analysis be conducted to 65 decimal places as described in sec .",
    "7 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the second case @xcite exact values of bessel and",
    "hankel functions were calculated from their well - known asymptotic expansions given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this instance",
    "there were no subdominant exponential series because the analysis was restricted to positive real values of the variable .",
    "however , unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , different values or levels of truncation were applied to the asymptotic series . whilst the truncated asymptotic series yielded a different value for a fixed value of the variable ,",
    "when it was added to the corresponding regularized value for its remainder , the actual value of the bessel or hankel function was calculated to within the machine precision of the computing system .",
    "the level of truncation was governed by an integer parameter @xmath6 , which will also be introduced here .",
    "in fact , the truncation parameter as it is called will play a much greater role here since it will be set equal to much larger values than those in ref .",
    "@xcite .    because a complete asymptotic expansion is composed of divergent series",
    ", exactification involves being able to obtain meaningful values from such series . to evaluate these",
    ", one must introduce the concept of regularization , which is defined in this work as the removal of the infinity in the remainder of an asymptotic series in order to make the series summable .",
    "it was first demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the infinity appearing in the remainder of an asymptotic series arises from an impropriety in the method used to derive it .",
    "consequently , regularization was seen as a necessary means of correcting an asymptotic method such as the method of steepest descent or iteration of a differential equation .",
    "regularization was also shown to be analogous to taking the finite or hadamard part of a divergent integral @xcite- @xcite .",
    "two very different techniques will be used to regularize the divergent series appearing throughout this work . as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , the most common method of regularizing a divergent series is borel summation , but often , it produces results that are not amenable to fast and accurate computation .",
    "to overcome this drawback , the numerical technique of mellin - barnes regularization was developed for the first time in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this regularization technique divergent series are expressed via cauchy s residue theorem in terms of mellin - barnes integrals and divergent arc - contour integrals . in the process of regularization",
    "the latter integrals are discarded , while the mellin - barnes integrals yield finite values , again much like the hadamard finite part of a divergent integral .",
    "amazingly , the finite values obtained when this technique is applied to an asymptotic expansion of a function yield exact values of the original function , but with one major difference compared with borel summation . instead of having to deal with stokes sectors and lines",
    ", we now have to contend with the domains of convergence for the mellin - barnes integrals , which not only encompass the former , but also overlap each other .",
    "so , while borel summation and mellin - barnes regularization represent techniques for regularizing asymptotic series and yield the same values for the original function from which the complete asymptotic expansion has been derived , they are nevertheless completely different .",
    "moreover , they can be used as a check on one another , which will occur throughout this work .    in the two cases of exactification mentioned above only positive real values of the power variable in the asymptotic expansions",
    "were considered , although it was stated that complex values would be studied in the future . as discussed in the preface to ref .",
    "@xcite , such an undertaking represents a formidable challenge because as the variable in an asymptotic series moves about the complex plane or its argument changes , a complete asymptotic expansion experiences significant modification due to the stokes phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this means that at particular rays or lines in the complex plane , an asymptotic expansion develops jump discontinuities , which can result in the emergence of an extra asymptotic series in the complete asymptotic expansion .",
    "thus , a complete asymptotic expansion is only uniform over either a sector or a ray in the complex plane , which means in turn that in order to exactify a complete asymptotic expansion over all arguments or phases of the variable in the power series , one requires a deep understanding of the stokes phenomenon .",
    "this understanding entails : ( 1 ) being able to determine the locations of all jump discontinuities , and ( 2 ) solving the more intricate problem of their quantification when they do occur .",
    "because of the stokes phenomenon , it becomes necessary not only to specify a complete asymptotic expansion , but also the range of the argument of the variable in the power series of the expansion .",
    "the combination of two such statements are referred to as asymptotic forms in this work .",
    "in particular , it should be noted that if the same complete asymptotic expansion is valid for different sectors or rays of the complex plane , then in each instance the original function being studied will also be different .    a major advance in enabling asymptotic forms to be evaluated over all values of the argument of the power series variable occurred with the publication of ref .",
    "@xcite , which began by building upon stokes seminal discovery of the phenomenon now named after him @xcite and then proceeded to develop via a series of propositions a theory / approach that enables complete asymptotic expansions to be derived for higher order stokes sectors than ever considered before .",
    "the reason why higher order stokes sectors or all values of the argument of the power series variable need to be considered is that when an asymptotic expansion is derived , it is often multivalued in nature . if one wishes to evaluate the original function over the entire principal branch for its variable via asymptotic forms , then the asymptotic forms pertaining to the higher / lower stokes sectors may be required due to the fact that the asymptotic series are often composed of ( inverse ) powers of the variable to a power .",
    "e.g. , the asymptotic series for the error function , @xmath7 , which is studied extensively in ch .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , is composed of an infinite series in powers of @xmath8 . if one wishes to determine values of @xmath7 over the principal branch via its asymptotic forms , then one requires the asymptotic forms for higher stokes sectors , not just the asymptotic form for the lowest stokes sector given by @xmath9 .",
    "this issue will be discussed in detail later , particularly in secs .  3 and 5 .    the developments in ref .",
    "@xcite were primarily concerned with the regularization of the two types of generalized terminants for all stokes sectors and lines .",
    "the term terminant was introduced by dingle @xcite after he found that the late terms of the asymptotic series for a host of functions in mathematical physics could be approximated by them . in the present work",
    "the aim is to continue with the development of a general theory in asymptotics by using the results in ref .",
    "@xcite as a base .",
    "it should be borne in mind that since complete asymptotic expansions are composed of divergent series , we are essentially talking about the development of a general theory for handling all divergent series , a quest that has stretched over centuries , but to this day remains elusive .",
    "one important reason why such a theory remains elusive is that the divergence can be different for diverse problems requiring different approaches or methods to regularize them .",
    "in fact , we shall see that the asymptotic forms derived in this work are composed of an infinite power series that can be regularized via generalized terminants and another infinite series , which is logarithmically divergent and thus , needs to be handled differently",
    ".    discovered in the 1730 s @xcite stirling s approximation / formula is a famous result for obtaining values of the factorial function or its more general version , the gamma function , denoted by @xmath10 . because the gamma function exhibits rapid exponential growth , those working in asymptotics frequently study the alternative version of the approximation , where it is expressed in terms of its logarithm , i.e.  @xmath0 . from an asymptotics point of view , @xmath0 is a far more formidable function than @xmath10 , because it possesses the multivaluedness of the logarithm function . to compensate for taking the logarithm",
    ", it is often assumed that one has at their disposal an exponentiating routine that will render values of @xmath10 from the complex numerical values calculated for @xmath0 . despite this ,",
    "however , no one has ever been able to render exact values of @xmath10 or @xmath0 when either function has been expressed in terms of the stirling approximation because when all the terms in the approximation are considered , it becomes an asymptotic expansion .",
    "consequently , it is not absolutely convergent . here",
    "we aim to investigate how the results in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to determine exact values of the complete version of stirling s approximation of @xmath0 for all values of @xmath11 . in short",
    ", this paper aims to exactify stirling s approximation .",
    "2 introduces the standard form of stirling s approximation for @xmath0 as given in ref .",
    "then @xmath0 is expressed in terms of the specific leading order terms associated with the approximation and a truncated asymptotic power series , whose coefficients are related to the bernoulli numbers . although it can be divergent , the latter series is often neglected in accordance with standard poincar@xmath12 asymptotics @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not known whether inclusion of the asymptotic series represents a complete asymptotic expansion for @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , we turn to binet s second expression of @xmath0 to generate the complete asymptotic expansion for @xmath0 , in which the asymptotic series is now expressed as an infinite sum of generalized terminants . moreover , a general theory for deriving regularized values of the remainders for both types of these series via borel summation is elucidated in ref .  @xcite . with the aid of this theory ,",
    "new asymptotic forms for @xmath0 are presented and proved for all stokes sectors and lines .",
    "because of an infinite number of singularities situated on each stokes line , on each occasion when crossing from one stokes sector to its neighbouring sector an extra infinite series appears in the asymptotic forms , which is referred to as the stokes discontinuity term .",
    "since these series can become logarithmically divergent , they must be regularized according to lemma  2.2 , which describes the regularization of the standard taylor series expansion of @xmath13 .",
    "the section concludes with how the expression for @xmath0 can be used to derive new results for the digamma function and euler s constant .    because such symbols as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the landau gauge symbols of @xmath19 and @xmath20 abound in the discipline , as stated in the foreword to ref .",
    "@xcite , one can virtually prove anything in standard poincar@xmath1 asymptotics , especially when an asymptotic expansion becomes divergent or possesses an infinity in its remainder .",
    "as a consequence , asymptotics is often ridiculed by pure mathematicians for being vague and limited in range of applicability .",
    "e.g. , when an expansion is described as being valid for large and small values of a variable , invariably one does not know the actual value when this applies or indeed , just how accurate it is compared with the original function . these symbols ,",
    "however , are not employed here at any stage , having become redundant due to the concept of regularization .",
    "nevertheless , the reader may still feel uncomfortable or uncertain about the results given in sec .  2 .",
    "therefore , sec .  3",
    "presents an extensive numerical investigation aimed at verifying the results in theorem  2.1 . as will be observed , since the results from these studies are exact , they are far more accurate than the alternative hyperasymptotic approach of developing strategies for truncating asymptotic series beyond the optimal point of truncation as discussed in refs .   @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , numerical studies can reveal many interesting properties , provided they are carried out in an appropriate manner .",
    "this refers to situations where claims are often made about a hyperasymptotic approach improving the accuracy of an asymptotic expansion when the asymptotic expansion is already very accurate .",
    "that is , often a relatively large value of the variable is chosen when the expansion has already been derived for large values .",
    "although the hyperasymptotic approach may improve the situation for such large values , the method generally breaks down for small values , where standard poincar@xmath1 asymptotics also fails . in this work , however , the opposite will be done ; exact values of a large variable expansion will be obtained for small and intermediate values of the variable , representing the regions where an asymptotic expansion is no longer valid .",
    "it should also be borne in mind that numbers do not lie , whereas  proving theorems \" with the afore - mentioned symbols are unable to provide an indication as to just how accurate an expansion is and where it actually does break down .",
    "3 proceeds with a numerical investigation into the borel - summed asymptotic forms given by eq .",
    "( [ fiftyeight ] ) . in the first example",
    "the remainder is expressed as an infinite sum involving the incomplete gamma function , which means that mathematica s intrinsic routine is used to evaluate the remainder . to make contact with standard poincar@xmath1 asymptotics , initially a large value of @xmath21",
    "is chosen , viz . @xmath22 .",
    "the truncation parameter @xmath6 takes on various values between 1 and 50 with the optimal point of truncation occurring around @xmath23 .",
    "this means for @xmath24 , the leading terms in stirling s approximation or @xmath25 given by eq .",
    "( [ fiftynine ] ) dominate , but for @xmath26 , the remainder and truncated sum dominate the calculations .",
    "nevertheless , when all the quantities in eq .",
    "( [ fiftyeight ] ) are added together , they always yield the exact value of @xmath27 regardless of the value of @xmath6 , provided a sufficient number of decimal places has been specified in order to allow the cancellation of decimal places to occur when the truncated sum and the regularized value of its remainder are combined . the same analysis is repeated for @xmath28 , which could never be studied in standard poincar@xmath29 asymptotics .",
    "for such a value the leading terms in stirling s approximation or @xmath25 are not accurate .",
    "hence , it is vital that the truncated sum of the asymptotic series and the regularized value of its remainder must be included to obtain @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , because there is no optimal point of truncation , the remainder and truncated sum diverge far more rapidly even for relatively small values of the truncation parameter .    at this stage",
    "the borel - summed asymptotic forms have been shown to yield @xmath0 for real values of @xmath31 .",
    "that is , exactification of the asymptotic form for a function has been achieved for real values of @xmath31 as in the previous instances studied in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "now , the analysis is extended to complex values of @xmath31 .",
    "this is done by putting @xmath32 , where @xmath21 equals either 3 or 1/10 and @xmath33 ranges over the principal branch of the complex plane , i.e.  @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , the regularized value of the remainder is evaluated by using the borel - summed forms in thm .",
    "that is , instead of relying on a routine that can calculate values of the incomplete gamma function , we evaluate the exponential integrals appearing in eqs.([sixty ] ) and ( [ sixtya ] ) by using the nintegrate routine in mathematica , which has the effect of increasing the time of computation substantially . for @xmath35 and @xmath6 below the optimal point of truncation , it is found that the leading terms of the stirling s approximation are accurate to the first couple of decimal places to @xmath0 , but not the thirty figure accuracy sought throughout this work . for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which represent the adjacent stokes sectors to @xmath38 , the stokes discontinuity is non - zero , but is @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , it only affects the accuracy beyond the seventh decimal place .",
    "similarly , the remainder is very small .",
    "the @xmath40 situation , however , is completely different . except for the values of the truncation parameter @xmath6 close to zero , the regularized value of the remainder and the truncated sum dominate ,",
    "although when combined , they cancel many decimal places . for @xmath41 , the stokes discontinuity term vanishes as for the @xmath35 case , but outside the sector , it makes a substantial contribution to @xmath0 , which can not be neglected . therefore , whilst the @xmath40 case exhibits completely different behaviour to @xmath35 , when all the contributions are combined , it is able to yield the values of @xmath0 to the 30 decimal places specified by the mathematica module / program as in the @xmath35 case .    for @xmath31",
    "situated on the stokes lines of @xmath42 , the asymptotic forms possess cauchy principal value integrals for their regularized remainder in addition to a stokes discontinuity term that is calculated by summing semi - residue contributions rather than full residue contributions in the adjacent stokes sectors .",
    "consequently , a different program is required to evaluate the various terms belonging to @xmath0 . for the stokes line given by @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath21 is set equal to 3 , while for @xmath44 , it is set equal to 1/10 .",
    "in both cases the truncated series and regularized remainder are purely imaginary , while the stokes discontinuity term is purely real , which is consistent with the rules for the stokes phenomenon presented in ch .  1 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "as found previously , the truncated sum and regularized value of the remainder are very small when @xmath45 for the large value of @xmath21 , but begin to diverge from thereon , while for @xmath40 , they dominate for @xmath46 . in addition , for @xmath35 , the stokes discontinuity is very small ( @xmath47 ) , while for @xmath40 , it represents a sizeable contribution to the real part of @xmath48 , although it is still not as significant as the real of the leading terms in the stirling approximation . nevertheless , all terms are necessary in order to obtain @xmath0 to thirty decimal figures / places .    the numerical studies of sec .",
    "3 demonstrate that it is indeed possible to obtain exact values of a function from its asymptotic expansion based on the conventional view of the stokes phenomenon .",
    "however , this contradicts a more radical view , first proposed by berry @xcite and later made  rigorous \" by olver @xcite . according to this view , which is now called stokes smoothing in spite of the fact stokes never held such a view ,",
    "the stokes phenomenon is no longer believed to be discontinuous , but undergoes a smooth and very rapid transition at stokes lines .",
    "that is , instead of a step - function multiplying the subdominant terms in an asymptotic expansion as in eqs .",
    "( [ sixtyfour ] ) and ( [ sixtysix ] ) , the stokes multiplier is now reckoned to behave for large values of @xmath21 as an error function that transitions rapidly from 0 to unity as opposed to toggling at a stokes line .",
    "the issue requires investigation here because if it is indeed valid , then it implies that one can never obtain exact values for a function from an asymptotic expansion as the stokes multiplier can not be made exact according to olver s treatment . whilst an exact representation for the stokes multiplier does not exist , the situation can be inverted by stating that one should not be able to obtain exact values for @xmath0 in the vicinity of any stokes line because according to the conventional view originated by stokes , the multiplier behaves as a step - function there . in fact , close to a stokes line , smoothing implies that the stokes multiplier is almost equal to 1/2 , not zero just before it or unity just past it .",
    "therefore , one should not be able to obtain exact values for @xmath0 according to the conventional view if stokes smoothing is valid . since a stokes line occurs at @xmath49 in the borel - summed asymptotic forms of thm .  2.1 , the numerical investigation in sec .  3",
    "is concluded by evaluating @xmath0 for @xmath50 , where @xmath21 is large and @xmath51 is both positive and negative with its magnitude ranging from 1/10 to @xmath52 . if the smoothing concept is correct , then the stokes multiplier should be close to @xmath53 and the stokes discontinuity term will be close to its value at @xmath54 . however , by using the asymptotic forms above and below the stokes line , viz .  the first and third forms in eq .",
    "( [ fiftyeight ] ) , we obtain exact values of @xmath0 for all values of @xmath51 in table  [ tab5 ] , thereby confirming the step - function behaviour of the stokes multiplier close to a stokes line .",
    "consequently , the conventional view of the stokes phenomenon is vindicated .    according to standard poincar@xmath1 asymptotics @xcite , it is generally not permissible to differentiate an asymptotic expansion . since it has been shown that the asymptotic forms in sec .",
    "2 yield exact values of @xmath0 over all values of the argument of @xmath31 and @xmath0 is differentiable , we can differentiate the asymptotic forms , n thm .",
    "2.1 thereby obtaining asymptotic forms for the digamma function , @xmath55 .",
    "3 concludes with a theorem , which gives the asymptotic forms for this special function .    whilst secs .  2 and 3 are devoted to the derivation and verification of borel - summed asymptotic forms for @xmath0 , sec .",
    "4 presents the asymptotic forms for @xmath0 obtained via mb regularization .",
    "as mentioned earlier , mb regularization was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite because it was able to produce asymptotic forms that are more amenable and faster to compute than the corresponding forms obtained via borel summation . however , this is not the only reason for studying the forms obtained by this technique .",
    "suppose the solution @xmath56 to a problem happens to equal @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "in this situation we can not use the inherent routine in a software package such as mathematica @xcite to calculate the values of the function when @xmath59 , since the routine for @xmath0 ( loggamma in mathematica ) is restricted to the argument lying in the principal branch of complex plane or to @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath31 is replaced by @xmath61 , the routine will only provide values of @xmath57 for @xmath62 .",
    "however , the aim is to determine @xmath56 over the entire the principal branch .",
    "we can use the borel - summed asymptotic forms for the higher or lower stokes sectors in this situation , but we also need to be able to verify the results .",
    "this can be accomplished by using the mb - regularized asymptotic forms , which represent a different method of evaluating @xmath56 .",
    "4.1 presents the mb - regularized asymptotic forms for @xmath0 , where the regularized value for the remainder of the asymptotic series in the stirling approximation is expressed in terms of mb integrals with domains of convergence given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , a non - negative integer .",
    "although there are no stokes lines and sectors in mb regularization , there is an extra term to the mb - regularized remainder arising from the summation of the residues of the singularities on the stokes lines . as a consequence , the extra term is expressed as an infinite series , which can become logarithmically divergent .",
    "regularization of the series results in ambiguity whenever @xmath65 or at the stokes lines , of which there are two in each domain of convergence .",
    "this ambiguity indicates that @xmath0 is discontinuous at the stokes lines and is resolved by adopting the zwaan - dingle principle @xcite , which states that an initially real function can not suddenly become imaginary .",
    "hence , the real value of the regularized value of the infinite series is chosen to yield the value of @xmath0 at stokes lines .",
    "as indicated previously , the loggamma routine only evaluates @xmath0 for @xmath31 situated in the principal branch . yet the borel - summed and mb - regularized asymptotic forms presented in secs .  2 and 4 cover all values of @xmath66 .",
    "this is particularly useful if we wish to evaluate @xmath67 for @xmath31 lying in the principal branch despite the fact that the loggamma routine will only yield values for @xmath68 .",
    "5 begins by presenting the mb - regularized asymptotic forms for @xmath67 . in this instance",
    "there are seven domains of convergence spanning the principal branch .",
    "in addition , the specific forms corresponding to the stokes lines are also presented .",
    "then the mb - regularized asymptotic forms are implemented in a mathematica module and the code is run for various values of the truncation parameter and @xmath33 ranging between @xmath69 . in those cases where there are two asymptotic forms for the value of @xmath33",
    ", the regularized values of @xmath67 are found to agree with each other in accordance with the concept of regularization . moreover , at the stokes lines other than @xmath70 , it is also found that the mb - regularized asymptotic forms exhibit jump discontinuities . basically , the mid - point between the discontinuous values from the left and right sides at each stokes line is selected as the regularized value for @xmath67 , which is in accordance with the zwaan - dingle principle and yields logarithmic terms .    sec .",
    "6 proceeds by presenting the borel - summed asymptotic forms for @xmath67 , where from eq .",
    "( [ ninety ] ) there are seven stokes sectors spanning the principal branch for @xmath31 .",
    "this is the same number of domains of convergence for the mb - regularized asymptotic forms , but since there is no overlapping , the stokes sectors are much narrower with different endpoints",
    ". nevertheless , in accordance with the concept of regularization the borel - summed forms should give identical values to the mb - regularized asymptotic forms . because the remainder for the borel - summed asymptotic forms is an infinite sum of exponential integrals , as indicated previously , the mathematica code calculating both mb - regularized and borel - summed asymptotic forms was implemented as a batch program to enable many calculations to be performed simultaneously .",
    "in addition , the stokes discontinuity and logarithmic terms require careful treatment . in order to avoid a blow - out in the computation time and a substantial reduction in the accuracy , a relatively large value of @xmath21 , viz .",
    "5/2 , was chosen .",
    "it is found that despite varying both @xmath33 and the truncation parameter , the mb - regularized results agree with each other to the 30 significant figures .",
    "the borel - summed results are also in agreement with the mb - regularized asymptotic forms provided the remainder is very small by choosing the truncation parameter not to be far away from the optimal point of truncation . for @xmath71 , however , it is found that the borel - summed and mb - regularized do agree with each other but to much less significant figures ( 22 as opposed to 30 ) .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the borel - summed remainder represents an approximation because the upper limit in its sum was set to @xmath72 .    because the borel - summed and mb - regularized asymptotic forms for @xmath67 are distinctly different at the stokes lines , sec .",
    "6 presents another batch program that evaluates these forms for @xmath73 , which is considered to lie in the intermediate region between large and small values of @xmath21 .",
    "such values could also never be considered in standard poincar@xmath29 asymptotics .",
    "the major differences between the mb - regularized and borel - summed asymptotic forms occur in the regularized values of the remainder of the asymptotic series and in the multiplier of the main logarithmic term .",
    "the remainder in the borel - summed asymptotic form is composed of an infinite number of cauchy principal value integrals , while the multiplier of the main logarithmic is multiplied by 1/2 signifying that semi - residues have been evaluated as opposed to full residues in the mb - regularized asymptotic forms .",
    "nevertheless , it is found that the complex values of @xmath67 obtained from the borel - summed forms agree to 27 decimal places / figures with the two corresponding mb - regularized forms for each stokes line .",
    "moreover , for @xmath74 , all three forms agree with the value obtained via the loggamma routine in mathematica @xcite . with this final numerical example",
    "stirling s approximation has been exactified for all values of @xmath11 .",
    "finally , the various mathematica programs used in the numerical studies are presented in a condensed format in the appendix .",
    "although the main reason for presenting them is to enable the reader to verify the results displayed in the tables , the reader can also use them to conduct their own numerical studies . in addition , they can be adapted to become more or less accurate by changing the various options appearing in the main routines . in general",
    ", it was found that the mb - regularized asymptotic forms took substantially less time to compute than the borel - summed asymptotic forms .",
    "stirling s approximation or formula @xcite is used to approximate large values of the factorial function , although what constitutes a large number is often unclear .",
    "nevertheless , it is often written as @xmath75 whilst the above statement may be regarded as a good approximation for large integer values of @xmath76 in standard poincar@xmath29 asymptotics , e.g. , for @xmath77 , the difference between the actual value and that from the above result is less than one percent , it is unsuitable for hyperasymptotic evaluation since there is an infinite number of terms that have been neglected . in this work",
    "we wish to extend the above approximation for the factorial function to the gamma function , @xmath10 , where the argument @xmath31 is complex and its magnitude @xmath21 is not necessarily large as in the above result . for the purposes of this work , the terms on the rhs of the above result",
    "will be referred to as the leading terms in stirling s approximation .",
    "when we derive the complete asymptotic expansion of @xmath0 in sec .",
    "2 , they will be denoted by @xmath25 , where @xmath76 is replaced by @xmath31 in the above result .",

    "if this were the case , then the function represented by the series would be infinite everywhere and , consequently of very little use or interest just as its inverse function would be zero everywhere .",

    "it is well - known that an asymptotic expansion is only valid over a sector in the complex plane and that on reaching the boundary of such a sector , it acquires a discontinuous term and yet another on moving to an adjacent sector .",
    "this is known as the stokes phenomenon @xcite , while the sectors over which a complete asymptotic expansion is uniform and their boundaries are called stokes sectors and lines , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "it is simply not sufficient to give an asymptotic expansion without specifying the stokes sector or line where it is uniform .",
    "therefore , we require the following definition .",
    "an asymptotic form is defined here as being composed of : ( 1 ) a complete asymptotic expansion , which not only possesses all terms in a dominant asymptotic power series such as @xmath139 above , but also all the terms in each subdominant asymptotic series , should they exist , and ( 2 ) the range of values or the sector / ray in the complex plane over which the argument of the variable in the series is valid .",

    "the second step in exactification is to regularize all asymptotic series appearing in the asymptotic forms , where regularization is defined as the removal of the infinity in the remainder of an asymptotic series so as to make the series summable . by itself",
    ", regularization represents an abstract mathematical technique when applied to divergent series , but it is necessary in asymptotics because it represents the means of correcting the asymptotic method used in the derivation of the complete asymptotic expansion . by carrying out the two steps , it has been possible to obtain exact values of @xmath0 to incredible accuracy , often more than 30 decimal figures , which was the restriction placed on the computing system used in this work .",
    "the computing system was composed of powerful computers and mathematical software in the form of mathematica @xcite . in those rare cases where 30 figure accuracy was not obtained ,",
    "it was generally attributed to having chosen too high or too low a value for the truncation parameter @xmath6 in the asymptotic forms , which resulted in very large values for the remainder . in first situation a large number of decimal figures in the remainder was cancelled by the large values of the truncated asymptotic series in the asymptotic forms . as a result of this cancellation , the capacity of the computing system to provide values within the accuracy and precision goals set in the programs was reduced . however , by extending the working precision , in particular , one was able to obtain the desired accuracy again , but at the expense of a substantial increase in computing time . the second case of very low values of the truncation parameter",

    "two techniques has been used to regularize the asymptotic series in a complete asymptotic expansion : ( 1 ) borel summation and ( 2 ) mellin - barnes ( mb ) regularization . though different , they both yield the same regularized values of an asymptotic series . in the case of borel summation",
    "the asymptotic forms for a function are different across adjacent stokes sectors , whose boundaries are separated by lines of discontinuity known as stokes lines or rays . the asymptotic forms arising from the mb regularization of an asymptotic series are dependent upon domains of convergence for specific mb integrals , which represent the remainder of the asymptotic series .",
    "unlike borel - summed asymptotic forms , the domains of convergence overlap , which means in turn that often two mb - regularized forms can be used to obtain the regularized value of an asymptotic series in the overlapping sectors . therefore , they serve as a check on whether the regularization process has been conducted properly .",
    "because this work has been concerned with stirling s approximation for @xmath0 rather than @xmath10 , it has resulted in the derivation of asymptotic forms quite unlike those derived previously in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite-@xcite . in this instance",

    "@xcite , the exponential terms arise from residues of the singularities in the cauchy integral .",
    "normally , they would not pose a problem , but because of the infinite sum over @xmath76 in the asymptotic forms , they result in logarithmically divergent series , which need to be regularized according to lemma  2.2 .    a similar situation develops when evaluating the mb - regularized value , which involves the same generalized type i terminant .",
    "although the sum over @xmath76 in the mb integrals reduces to a more compact form where the infinite sum is replaced by the riemann zeta function , we still obtain logarithmically divergent series similar to those in the borel - summed asymptotic forms . in this case",
    "the exponential terms arise from the differences in the mb integrals when they are valid over the common or overlapping sector of their domains of convergence .",
    "although these series can be mb - regularized , lemma  2.2 was used again to regularize them as it produces compact logarithmic terms , which do not require numerical integration .",
    "that is , although the results in thm .",
    "4.1 are not purely mb - regularized asymptotic forms , they are more compact since they avoid the computation of extra mb integrals . furthermore , the logarithmic terms , which are denoted by @xmath345 or @xmath346 and @xmath347 , respectively , in the borel - summed and mb - regularized asymptotic forms , are not only necessary for exhibiting the multivaluedness of @xmath0 , but also enable values of the special function to be evaluated beyond the principal branch of @xmath348 , which the loggamma routine in mathematica @xcite is unable to do .",
    "we have also seen in this work that the mb - regularized asymptotic forms are far more expedient for obtaining values of @xmath0 than their borel - summed counterparts because the latter possess an infinite convergent sum of exponential integrals , which is not as amenable to numerical computation as the mb integrals for the remainder of the asymptotic series @xmath139 given by eq .",
    "( [ sixteen ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the borel - summed asymptotic forms must be truncated at a very large number , @xmath72 here , in order to match the accuracy of the mb - regularized remainders , which , as mentioned above , benefit from having their infinite sum replaced by the riemann zeta function .",
    "it should also be noted that the selection of a very low value for the truncation parameter could affect the accuracy of the borel - summed remainder , but for these cases the problem could be overcome by increasing the limit well beyond @xmath72 , again at the expense of computer time .",
    "thus , the borel - summed asymptotic forms for the regularized remainder take significantly longer to compute than their mb - regularized counterparts .",
    "another disadvantage with the borel - summed asymptotic forms is that they are vastly different along stokes lines compared with stokes sectors and thus , separate programs need to be written , whereas only one program is required for obtaining the values of @xmath0 via its mb - regularized asymptotic forms in thm",
    ".  4.1 .    in conclusion",
    ", this work has profound implications for both ( hyper)asymptotics and mathematics in general .",
    "first , we have seen that it is permissible to differentiate the asymptotic expansion for a differentiable function provided it is complete , which contradicts widely accepted dogma in standard poincar@xmath349 asymptotics @xcite .",
    "next , as a result of regularization , one can obtain exact values of a multivalued function from its complete asymptotic expansion for all values of the argument of the main variable .",
    "consequently , asymptotics has been transformed into a proper mathematical discipline capable of eliciting exact values rather than one suffering from the drawbacks of vagueness , limited accuracy and non - specific ranges of validity / applicability .",
    "finally , this work has demonstrated that mathematicians should no longer fear divergence by trying to avoid it at all costs , but should confront it by taking on the challenge to tame it since this will produce new and interesting mathematics .",

    "<S> hence , two mb - regularized asymptotic forms can be used to evaluate @xmath0 . despite having to truncate the borel - summed remainder </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that all the remainders combined with ( 1 ) the truncated asymptotic series , ( 2 ) the leading terms of stirling s approximation and ( 3 ) their logarithmic terms yield identical values of @xmath0 . in the few cases where the accuracy falls away </S>",
    "<S> , it is mostly due to a very high value for the truncation parameter , which results in the cancellation of redundant decimal places . where possible , all the asymptotic forms yield the same values as the loggamma routine in mathematica </S>",
