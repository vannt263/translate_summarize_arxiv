    "in this section , we briefly recall the theoretical description of an ultracold atomic gas trapped in an optical lattice . the optical lattice potential , which results from the superposition of three orthogonal and independent pairs of counterpropagating laser beams , can be written as @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the lattice depth , @xmath2 is the laser wavevector , @xmath3 is the laser wavelength and @xmath4 is the atomic mass . as usual , we measure @xmath1 in units of the single - photon recoil energy @xmath5 .",
    "the lattice potential has a simple cubic periodicity in three dimensions , with a lattice spacing @xmath6 nm in our case .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the behavior of the atomic system in such a potential can be described by the bose - hubbard model , defined by the hamiltonian    @xmath7    here the operator @xmath8 creates an atom at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the on - site number operator , and the notation @xmath11 restricts the sum to nearest neighbors only .",
    "the relative strength between the tunneling matrix element @xmath12 and the on - site interaction energy @xmath13 is controlled by the depth @xmath1 of the periodic potential which confines the atoms . , and @xmath14 .",
    "we have obtained these formula , accurate within 1 % in the range @xmath15 , by numerically solving for the band structure and performing a fit to the calculated curves . ] the phase diagram of this hamiltonian is well known : the system is in a mi state within characteristic lobes in a @xmath16 versus chemical potential @xmath17 phase diagram , and in a superfluid state outside of these lobes @xcite .    in the experiments ,",
    "an additional potential @xmath18 is superimposed to the lattice potential , leading to a spatially varying chemical potential across the cloud .",
    "this favors the formation of a `` wedding cake '' structure of alternating mi and superfluid shells , which reflects the phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the external potential is due to a combination of a magnetic potential in which the condensate is initially formed and of an optical potential due to the gaussian shape of the lattice beams . to a good approximation",
    ", it can be considered as a harmonic potential with trapping frequency @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the frequency of the magnetic trap , assumed isotropic , and where @xmath21 is the waist ( @xmath22 radius of the intensity profile ) of the lattice beams , assumed identical for all axes . for large lattice depths",
    ", the confinement is mainly due to the optical part .    in the current experiments ,",
    "this external potential varies slowly across the lattice . in this limit",
    ", the shell structure can be calculated in a local density approximation , which assumes a known relation @xmath23 $ ] between the density @xmath24 and the chemical potential @xmath17 for the homogeneous system .",
    "then , the coarse - grained density for the inhomogeneous system is calculated as @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the chemical potential is fixed by the relation @xmath26 . for a fixed lattice depth and atom number",
    ", we calculate numerically the relation @xmath23 $ ] using mean - field theory at zero temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ in the mean - field ground state @xcite .",
    "we then repeat the steps outlined above , varying the chemical potential until the target atom number is obtained within 0.1 % . for all calculations ,",
    "the values @xmath27hz and @xmath28 m are used , which match our experimental parameters .",
    "we show in fig .  [ density ]",
    "an example of such a calculation for a lattice depth of @xmath29 and @xmath30 atoms .",
    "the presence of the external potential significantly affects the atom distribution in the lattice , which is determined by the competition between interaction and potential energy . on the one hand ,",
    "expanding the cloud minimizes the density and the interaction energy , and on the other , contracting it minimizes the potential energy , as in conventional harmonic traps @xcite .",
    "the latter is favored at low atom numbers , where only a @xmath31 shell forms . when more atoms are added , the radius of the unity filled mi region increases until a critical atom number , which we estimate to be @xmath32 atoms for our parameters , is reached . above this critical atom number , a higher density core appears near the trap center .",
    "a mi with @xmath33 atoms per site is then obtained near the trap center if the lattice depth is above the critical value @xmath34 .",
    "this value has been calculated using the boundary derived in @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of nearest neighbors in 3 dimensions . in the specific example shown in fig",
    ".  [ density ] , we have chosen @xmath29 and @xmath30 atoms , so that both @xmath31 and @xmath37 mi are present . similarly , we calculate for our experimental parameters that an @xmath38 shell is also present for atom numbers larger than @xmath39 , and lattice depths larger than @xmath40 .     and @xmath30 atoms .",
    "here @xmath41 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the upper solid line indicates the numerical calculation of the total density , and the dotted line is the @xmath42 extrapolation ( see section [ comparison_section ] ) .",

    "we now turn to the description of the interference pattern observed after release of the atom cloud from the optical lattice and a period of free expansion . from an absorption image of such a pattern , the phase coherence of the atomic sample can be directly probed .",
    "the density distribution of the expanding cloud after a time of flight @xmath43 can be calculated as @xcite @xmath44 which mirrors the momentum distribution of the original cloud .",
    "momentum space and real space in the image plane are related by the scaling factor @xmath45 - independent of the lattice parameters .",
    "the envelope @xmath46 is the fourier transform of the wannier function in the lowest bloch band .",
    "when each potential well is approximated as an harmonic potential , the wannier function is the corresponding gaussian ground state wavefunction .",
    "the envelope function in eq .",
    "( [ ntof ] ) then reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and where @xmath49 is the size of the on - site wannier function . finally , we have defined the quantity @xmath50 when @xmath51 is restricted to the first brillouin zone , @xmath52 is nothing else than the quasi - momentum distribution .",
    "information about the many - body system is contained in this quantity , which is periodic with the periodicity of the reciprocal lattice @xmath53 .",
    "thus , to predict the interference pattern and compare to the experiments , our goal is to calculate @xmath52 for a given lattice depth and density .",
    "for simplicity , we consider first the case of uniform filling in the lattice , _ i.e. _ an integer number @xmath54 of atoms per site , and we assume the system to be at zero temperature and in the insulating phase . in the limit of zero tunneling , the ground state wavefunction is a perfect mi , _ i.e. _ a product of number states at each site , and its green function @xmath55 can be calculated exactly ( see appendix ) .",
    "the lowest - lying excited states of the system are `` particle '' and `` hole '' states , where a supplementary particle is added ( respectively removed ) at one lattice site .",
    "creating these excitations costs a finite interaction energy , respectively @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .    to calculate the quasi - momentum distribution for a finite tunneling @xmath12",
    ", many - body techniques can be applied to obtain the single - particle green function , @xmath58 . using a path integral approach , several authors @xcite have been able to calculate the green function of the mott insulator within the rpa , @xmath59 the poles @xmath60 of the green function are the quasi - particle energies @xcite @xmath61,\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ ekpm ] ) , @xmath62 is the dispersion relation for a free particle in the tight - binding limit , and @xmath63=\\sqrt{t_{\\bf k}^2 + 4 t_{\\bf k } u(n_0+\\frac{1}{2})+u^2}$ ] .",
    "the particle weight is @xmath64 $ ] . in the appendix , we present an alternative derivation of ( [ green ] ) based on the equation of motion method , which follows closely hubbard s method @xcite . here",
    "we will simply comment on the physical picture behind this approach .",
    "the rpa considers that the particle / hole nature of the low - lying excitations is not significantly changed by introducing a finite tunneling ( in technical terms , the self energy remains approximately the same as in the @xmath65 limit ) .",
    "the first effect of tunneling is to introduce a finite amount of particle / hole components in the the many - body ground state wavefunction . in the form given in @xcite , corresponding to a first order calculation , a particle / hole pair necessarily occupies two neighboring lattice sites due to the particular form of the tunneling hamiltonian . through higher - order tunneling processes captured by the green function ( [ green ] ) ,",
    "the particle and the hole forming the pair can tunnel independently . as a result , the pair acquires a mobility through the lattice , and may even `` stretch '' over a few lattice sites .",
    "this mobility acquired by particle / hole pairs is reflected in the modified dispersion relation ( [ ekpm ] ) , which explicitly includes the band structure .",
    "note finally that higher order excitations , corresponding to occupation numbers @xmath66 , ... are neglected . at zero temperature ,",
    "such excitations become important only very close to the superfluid transition where the mi is destroyed .",
    "the quasi - momentum distribution can be directly deduced using the general relation @xmath67 . using ( [ green ] )",
    ", one has @xcite @xmath68 to first order in @xmath16 , this reduces to @xmath69 also obtained in @xcite by calculating the many - body wave function perturbatively .",
    "we find that the two predictions rapidly converge .",
    "for example , they differ by less than 10 % for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "these values have to be compared to the respective critical values for mi formation , @xmath74 .",
    "this indicates that the coherence beyond nearest neighbors is rather rapidly lost as one goes further into the mi phase .",
    "however , the visibility itself remains finite in a substantial range of @xmath75 , implying a persistent short - range coherence .",
    "to compare with the experiments reported in @xcite , several features have to be taken into account .",
    "first , only the column density @xmath24 is accessible experimentally , _",
    "i.e. _ the density integrated along the probe line - of - sight ( which we take here parallel to the @xmath76 axis ) .",
    "second , the visibility is experimentally deduced from two points according to @xmath77    , in the superfluid regime .",
    "the right graph indicates the geometry of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "gray areas are the first and second brillouin zones ( projected in the image plane ) , and the white dot indicate the position of the maxima of the interference pattern . along the circle , the wannier function envelope takes the same value , and we measure the interference `` minimum '' at the intersection of this circle and of the diagonal of the lattice square lattice , indicated by the black dot.,width=302 ]    to eliminate the wannier envelope , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are measured from two points at the same distance from the cloud center ( see fig .",
    "[ expvis ] ) , so that the envelope automatically cancels out . for example , @xmath78 is found at point @xmath80 and @xmath79 at @xmath81 .",
    "this reduces the visibility compared to the usual definition . in the theoretical calculation it is straightforward to account for these two effects .    the third effect , the shell structure of the mi , is handled here in an approximate way . in the numerical calculations",
    ", the shell distribution always includes small regions with non - integer filling , which the theory above can not handle .",
    "however , these domains are small , and have a strongly depleted superfluid component , so that we do not expect them to have a large effect on the visibility .",
    "therefore , we approximate the density distribution by a `` ziggurat''-like profile , where only mi shells are present .",
    "the actual extension of each shell is calculated as if @xmath12 were zero , taking the external potential into account @xcite . in fig",
    ".  [ density ] , we compare the profile in this approximation ( dotted line ) with the numerically calculated one ( solid line ) . for large lattice depths , both agree reasonably .",
    "note that the density profile still depends weakly on the lattice depth through the external confinement [ see eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) ] .     and",
    "@xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines indicate the calculated visibility for homogeneous mi with filling factor @xmath72 .",
    "the solid lines are calculations including the inhomogeneous shell distribution .",
    "typical standard deviations for the experimental data are 1 % or below .",
    "our calculation of the equilibrium distribution at zero temperature indicate that in case * a * , only mi regions with @xmath31 and @xmath37 atoms per site form , whereas in case * b * , a core with @xmath38 is also present.,width=302 ]    the momentum distribution deduced from eqs .",
    "( [ ntof],[shom ] ) is averaged over the distribution of atoms to compare with the experimental data ( see @xcite for details on the experiment ) .",
    "the results are plotted versus lattice depth in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , for two different atom numbers in the lattice . for the lowest atom number @xmath30",
    ", we calculate that only @xmath31 and @xmath37 shells are present . for the largest @xmath82 ,",
    "a core with @xmath38 atoms per site is also present .",
    "note that in the latter case , the actual density distribution might deviate more from the calculated one , due to three - body losses in the @xmath38 region .",
    "we find that the calculation agrees with the measured visibility within 20 % for @xmath83 .",
    "the theory curves terminate when the mi shell with highest filling disappears , as it is replaced by a large superfluid core not described by our theory .",
    "note that the calculation does not include any free parameter .",
    "however , we consistently find that the calculated value lies below the measured visibility for large lattice depths @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , the deviation increases with increasing lattice depths , which shows that the superfluid shells play little role in determining the visibility for such large lattice depths , as assumed in our calculation . in fig .",
    "[ deviation ] , the fractional deviation of the calculated visibility from the measured one is plotted versus lattice depth for four data sets . remarkably ,",
    "although the atom numbers are rather different from one data set to another we find a common trend in the data . on the other hand , this observation also suggests that a breakdown of adiabaticity occurs for the particular ramp used in the experiments to increase the laser intensity to its final value , a point already identified in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that , perhaps surprisingly , the visibility in the mi may be a sensitive probe of the many - body dynamics of the superfluid - to - insulator transition .",

    "in conclusion , we have derived in this paper a theoretical expression for the interference pattern of a mott insulator after release from the optical lattice and a time of flight .",
    "our calculations take deviations from perfect filling due to a finite tunneling into account , and use a simplified but realistic model of the shell structure of the mi .",
    "good agreement with our experimental data reported in @xcite is found , at least for moderate lattice depths . for very large lattice depths , an increasing deviation points to non - adiabatic effects in the conversion from a condensate to an insulating state , which could in principle be studied by the method presented here .",
    "nevertheless , in view that no free parameter is included in the theory , we conclude that the momentum distribution ( [ shom ] ) describes the system well .",
    "this supports the physical picture of the system as a ( dilute ) gas of partice / hole pairs , mobile through the lattice , on top of a regularly filled mott insulator .",
    "furthermore , the validity of the rpa to describe their behavior is qualitatively verified .",
    "our calculation neglects entirely the superfluid component , which is correct only for large lattice depths where the system is almost completely insulating . recently ,",
    "several authors @xcite have proposed to modify the standard mean - field description @xcite to better account for long- and short - range coherence .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the predictions of those approaches with our data for lower lattice depths , where the system is expected to be a strongly depleted superfluid , and therefore amenable neither to a bogoliubov - like description nor to a strongly interacting one as provided in this paper .",
    "also , an investigation of finite temperature effects @xcite would be useful . in particular , an interesting question is to know whether the visibility measurements presented here could be used for thermometry in the lattice .",

    "in this appendix , we present a derivation of eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) using the equation of motion approach .",
    "the single - particle green function is defined at zero temperature as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the time - ordering operator and @xmath93 is the heaviside step function . since we consider a time - independent and homogeneous system , we take a fourier transformation of this equation with respect to space and time ( denoted by the symbol @xmath94 ) , and define @xmath95 \\ ] ]    in the frequency - momentum representation , the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath96 $ ] takes the form @xmath97.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term on the right hand side of ( [ gk ] ) is usually rewritten as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the self - energy .",
    "this gives the expression @xmath100    let us first assume that no tunneling is present ( @xmath101 ) . in this case , the green function can be obtained exactly from its definition ( [ gdef ] ) and the ground state wave function @xmath102 , where each site is in the fock state @xmath103 . the result @xmath104 is independent of momentum , and reads @xmath105 in this self - interacting limit , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) as @xmath106 , with the self energy @xcite @xmath107 this expression is exact in the @xmath108 limit , and coincides with the one found in @xcite .",
    "the first term is simply the hartree - fock energy per particle for uncondensed atoms ( hence the factor of @xmath33 ) , whereas the second term - which has the same order of magnitude at low energy - accounts for the correlations between particle that drive the system into the perfectly ordered ground state .    if we now restore a finite tunneling , but still consider a system in the insulating phase , a reasonable approximation is to assume that the self energy is not changed with respect to the strongly interacting limit .",
    "we comment on this approximation in the test . making this approximation yields @xmath109 which has a typical rpa form . using the explicit result for @xmath55",
