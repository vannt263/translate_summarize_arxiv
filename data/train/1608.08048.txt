    "in the last few years , a lot of attention has been devoted to the investigation of light propagation in a inhomogeneous anisotropic material , featuring a local rotation of the optic axis but no variations in the local refractive indices . in this configuration",
    ", a phase distribution proportional to the local rotation angle of the optic axis can be superposed on the beam wavefronts , leading to the advent of the so - called planar photonics @xcite . from a physical point of view",
    ", the space - dependent phase delay is due to a gradient in the pancharatnam - berry phase ( pbp ) @xcite .",
    "the pbp is associated with a change in the beam polarization . for a closed path ( same initial and final state )",
    "the pbp is provided by the solid angle sustained by the closed circuit on the poincar sphere @xcite .",
    "+ historically , the idea to modulate the phase of an electromagnetic field via the pbp is due by bomzon et al . who used a metallic sub - wavelength grating ( nowadays it would be called a two - dimensional metamaterial ) @xcite . the idea has then been applied by marrucci and collaborators to nematic liquid crystals ( nlcs ) , a natural material where the local direction of the optic axis can be fixed by properly tailoring the boundary conditions via optical alignment techniques @xcite .",
    "the full control on the local direction of nlc molecules paved the way to new functionalities , permitting for example the conversion of spin angular momentum ( polarization degree of freedom ) to orbital angular momentum ( spatial degree of freedom ) @xcite and the realization of polarization gratings of amplitude @xcite and phase @xcite .",
    "photo - alignment techniques have been also applied to polymerizable nlc for the realization of vortex plates @xcite . recently",
    ", the pbp has been used to tailor beam wavefront after reflection from a layer of chiral liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "later on , interest on the pbp boosted thanks to the introduction of metasurfaces and the realization of several polarization - dependent optical devices @xcite , such as lenses @xcite , holograms @xcite , deflectors based upon the spin - hall effect @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we investigate the propagation of finite - size electromagnetic waves in inhomogeneous anisotropic materials , invariant along the propagation direction @xmath0 but subject to a point - wise rotation of the principal axes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry_3d ] ) .",
    "this problem has been analyzed in the geometrical optics limit , analyzing the dependence of beam trajectory on the photon spin , the so called optical magnus effect or spin - hall effect @xcite .",
    "the coupling between diffraction and pbp has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in the limit of wide beams using plane waves expansions , whereas our approach holds valid until longitudinal fields become relevant , the latter corresponding to beams as wide as the wavelength @xcite .",
    "we show that light propagates under the influence of an effective photonic potential , leading to leaky guided modes for bell - shaped distributions of the rotation angle @xcite ( fig .",

    "@xcite we generalize the theory to the full 3d case , showing that no relevant differences with respect to the two - dimensional cases arise . then , under the bidimensional approximation , we show in detail how the quasi - modes of the structure can be found , and we pinpoint the role played by the medium birefringence .",
    "we also discuss the physical origin of the effective potential , ascribing its presence to the periodic modulation in propagation of the pbp , in turn leading to a @xmath0-independent potential through the kapitza effect @xcite .",
    "theoretical results are verified against bpm ( beam propagation method ) simulations , in the rotated reference system . additionally , we confirmed the findings by direct comparison with exact solutions of the maxwell s equations provided by fdtd ( finite difference time domain ) simulations .",

    "we then introduce the ordinary and the extraordinary refractive index as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "local rotation around the axis @xmath0 of the optic axis ( i.e. , of the principal axes ) can be written as @xmath16 matrix operates on a vector in the laboratory framework @xmath17 and provides as output the coordinates of the vector in the cartesian system aligned with the local principal axes .",

    "is made through the matrix @xmath26 @xmath27 where subscripts l and r correspond to the lcp and rcp , respectively . eventually , the overall transmission of the anisotropic slab is @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the retardation between ordinary and extraordinary components , @xmath30 is the birefringence and @xmath31 is the average index of refraction @xcite .",
    "owing to birefringence , eq .   describes a continuous exchange of power between the two circular polarizations rcp and lcp .",
