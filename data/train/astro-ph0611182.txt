    "sne iib an ii , at similar phases , are the objects with the lowest o i 7773  optical depth .",
    "the stronger and deeper permitted oxygen lines at early phases of sne ic spectra might imply that they are less diluted by the presence of a helium envelope .",
    "indeed one might expect oxygen lines to be more prominent for a `` naked '' c / o progenitor core . despite the paucity of well sampled ccsne observations , two observational aspects tend to reinforce this belief : @xmath44 , the forbidden lines , especially [ oi]6300 ,  6364 , seem to appear earlier following a sne sequence `` ic@xmath29ib@xmath29iib@xmath29ii '' .",
