    "spectacular creation of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in atomic traps @xcite has opened unique possibilities for controlled studies of ultracold bosonic gases @xcite .",
    "one of the basic problems in physics of a bec is how density perturbations propagate throughout a bosonic cloud .",
    "there has been a big interest in this problem and both an experiment @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite have been performed .",
    "these theoretical calculations have been done , however , for infinitesimally small perturbations , which dynamics hardly exhibits nonlinear effects leading to formation of shock waves .",
    "this paper is devoted to theoretical studies of a shock wave formation in homogeneous and harmonically trapped bec .",
    "shock waves have been widely investigated in different physical systems @xcite .",
    "for example , we find them in a gas bubble driven acoustically @xcite , in a photonic crystal @xcite and even in mathematical models of traffic flow @xcite .",
    "of particular importance are studies of shock waves in classical compressible gases , where they appear whenever large enough density perturbation propagates @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of classical gases , shock waves in ultracold `` quantum '' atomic gases still require both theoretical and experimental investigations even though some results have been already obtained .",
    "the propagation of steep density perturbations in a bec has been experimentally investigated in @xcite ; the theory of shocks in fermi ( tonks ) gas has been proposed in @xcite ; an approximate theoretical description of shock waves in a bec has been worked out in @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to mention that shocks have been studied in physical systems governed by nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "these studies can be related to investigations of shock waves in a bec due to formal similarity between the nonlinear schrdinger equation and mean - field equations of a bec . nevertheless , it is important to realize that dynamics of shock waves even in weakly interacting bose gas , may differ from predictions of the mean - field approximation , as will be proposed in sec .",
    "the mean - field description of a bec is provided by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite , which in the hydrodynamical variables and dimensionless form @xcite reads @xmath0 first equation is a continuity equation , while the second one is similar to the euler equation from classical hydrodynamics . naturally , @xmath1 is atomic density and @xmath2 is a velocity field . the atomic density in ( [ h ] )",
    "satisfies @xmath3 , a constant @xmath4 is proportional to the strength of two - body repulsive interactions between atoms .",
    "the term @xmath5 is called quantum pressure ( qp ) .",
    "it is comparable to the @xmath6 term only if the spatial scale of density variations is of the order of the healing length @xmath7 .",
    "simple estimation on the basis of ( [ h ] ) shows that @xmath8 .    in the following we assume that a bec is initially in a state having a gaussian - like density wave packet created by adiabatically focused laser beam on an atomic cloud .",
    "alternatively , an atomic cloud can be cooled in a presence of a laser beam , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the width of a laser beam is large compared to the system s healing length , so that the density perturbation is broad and the qp term , at least initially , is negligible .",
    "we are interested in dynamics of such a laser - induced perturbation after abrupt laser turn off .",
    "we show that it splits into two wave packets propagating in opposite directions .",
    "these wave packets undergo self - steepening dynamics .",
    "finally , two shock wave fronts are formed .",
    "first we consider the case of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) bec in a periodic box having boundaries at @xmath9 .",
    "there is initially a laser beam producing the potential @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being controlled by intensity and detuning of a laser beam .",
    "the initial density of atoms takes form @xmath13 where @xmath14 provides normalization of ( [ dens0 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the system is in the ground state which implies @xmath15 , and that the qp term is negligible : @xmath16 .",
    "it means that we are in the so - called thomas - fermi ( tf ) regime @xcite . under such conditions @xmath17 .",
    "let us first inspect what happens in a low amplitude limit .",
    "the analysis can be done in the framework of a bogoliubov approach or within a hydrodynamical approach .",
    "the first possibility was explored for ultracold fermions in @xcite . here",
    "we follow the second one to give the reader more insight into the problem .",
    "we express @xmath18 as @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "having in mind that the velocity field @xmath21 is of the same order as @xmath22 , a linearization of ( [ h ] ) without the qp term gives @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a speed of sound wave propagating on density @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "such a process is impossible in a system which dynamics is governed by a single - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "it is a nice interaction - induced phenomenon in a bec .",
    "interestingly , a similar effect can be observed in fermi ( tonks ) clouds @xcite .",
    "it is also easy to see from ( [ wave ] ) that the splitting phenomenon happens in exactly the same way regardless of the form of an initial shape .",
    "let us also remark that , since we consider particles in a periodic box , all the equations should be strictly speaking written in an appropriate fourier basis . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 the discrepancy between obtained results and exact ones is hardly visible .",

    "we have focused on 1d systems recently realized experimentally @xcite , but we expect that our work may provide a theoretical basis for investigations of quasi - one - dimensional setups widely studied in laboratories .",
    "the easiest for experimental inspection are predictions for harmonically trapped condensates .",
    "we expect that also findings for homogeneous bosonic clouds can be verified with the help of , e. g. atomic wave guides @xcite .",
    "it is worth to point out that shock - like structures have been already studied experimentally in a two component bec @xcite , where time evolution of dark narrow density perturbations was observed .",
    "the initial size of a wave packet in @xcite was of the order of the healing length , which made observation of impulse s self - steepening , a clear signature that shock formation takes place , very difficult .",
    "we expect that the experimental setup proposed by us should give more convincing results .",
    "in fact , it seems that a slight change in a setup of @xcite together with a little bit higher measurement accuracy should verify our predictions at least qualitatively .    from the theoretical side we would like to note that formation of shock - like solutions in a harmonic trap has been noticed in @xcite .",
    "our considerations provide an analytical insight into their numerics .",
    "it is also worth to mention , that it is possible to find an approximate analytical solution of hydrodynamical equations ( [ h ] ) with the quantum pressure term .",
    "that solution also exhibits shock behavior , and its properties have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to discuss differences between the traveling wave solutions presented in this paper and recently investigated , both theoretically and experimentally , solitonic solutions in a bec @xcite .",
    "our paper describes density perturbations which change their shape during time evolution , while soliton - like density wave packets propagate in dispersionless manner @xcite .",
    "the main difference between time evolution of wave packets considered here and solitonic ones results mainly from the difference in their width .",
    "the width of a soliton is of the order of the healing length , which makes the quantum pressure term in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) considerable .",
    "this allows for finding a solution that propagate without changes of shape .",
    "our solution , eq .",
    "( [ nonlin ] ) , describes a perturbation that is much broader than the healing length . in this case",
    "the quantum pressure term is negligible and instead of solitonic solutions shock waves show up .",
    "it is also worth to realize that the initial shape of a shock - like solution , determined by the function @xmath188 in eq .",
    "( [ nonlin ] ) , can be arbitrary as long as @xmath188 changes significantly on length scales much larger than the healing length .",
    "conversely , solitons have precisely defined shape @xcite .",
    "one of the main open questions is how the shock - like impulse s front evolves in time .",
    "we have pointed out that the mean - field approach gives rather doubtful answer and suggested a possible explanation .",
    "further investigations to resolve that issue will be a subject of future studies .",
    "unfortunately , contrary to the case of fermi ( tonks ) gases @xcite , it is very difficult to solve a many - body problem exactly .",
    "finally , it is worth to point out that both a splitting of an initial perturbation and a shock wave formation take place in classical hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it suggests that qualitatively the same phenomena can be observed in a cold bosonic ( fermionic ) gas above the condensation ( fermi ) temperature .",
    "the crossover from a classical non - degenerate to a quantum degenerate regime can be an interesting subject for future experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "in particular , differences in properties of cold bosons and fermions can be very exciting .",
    "indeed , e. g. a sound velocity of 1d ultracold bosons ( fermions ) is @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) , while in the non - degenerate regime it has to have the same dependence on density for bosons and fermions .",
    "i would like to acknowledge discussions with aneta damska and zbyszek karkuszewski .",
    "i am also grateful to andreas buchleitner for drawing my attention to ref .",
    "@xcite and for his hospitality during preparation of the manuscript at mpipks dresden .",
    "i want also to thank l. p. pitaevskii for showing me the ref .",
    "this work was mainly supported by kbn project 2 p03b 124 22 .",
    "additional support from the alexander von humboldt foundation , deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and volkswagenstiftung under the grant `` entanglement measures and the influence of noise '' is also gratefully acknowledged .",
    "let @xmath192 be a mass of a bosonic particle .",
    "for a case of particles in a box we take arbitrary length scale @xmath193 for a unit of length and @xmath194 for a unit of time . in a harmonically trapped system",
    "a unit of length equals @xmath195 and a unit of time is @xmath196 ( @xmath197 is a harmonic trapping frequency ) .",
    "we use the bulirsch - stoer method @xcite in a grid basis for integration of eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "such an approach can not correctly describe shock propagation since it calculates derivatives across a shock wave front .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of ( [ h ] ) without and with the qp term . in the first case",
    "the method produced results not converging on arbitrarily large grid  as expected from ( [ an1])-([xs ] ) shocks have appeared in the numerical solution .",
    "conversely , the results of calculations with the qp term where perfectly converged indicating that shocks were absent in the solution of ( [ h ] ) with the qp term .",
    "we have also performed the same calculation in the appropriately truncated fourier basis to avoid potential problems with calculation of derivatives . as expected , the results were the same as those obtained on a grid for large enough size of the fourier basis .",
