    "we therefore conclude that the coarse - grained limit of the symmetric rsos model is the ew equation   is uniquely fixed , and that the resulting coarse - grained equation does not depend on this value .",
    "another crucial point is that the terms neglected in eqn .   may also be shown to vanish in the limit . for a detailed discussion of these points ,",
