    "quantum mechanics allows for correlations that can not be understood within the classical paradigm of local realism , which naturally grows out of experiences gathered in the macroscopic world @xcite .",
    "models based on this paradigm are not able to reproduce fully predictions of the quantum theory unless supplied with additional controversial assumptions like non - locality , superluminal communication , or negative probabilities @xcite . a great deal of effort has been dedicated to identify the borders defined by local realistic theories , beyond which quantum mechanics offers the most dramatic manifestations of its unique character .",
    "this work currently finds applications in novel , quantum - based protocols for secure communication and information processing @xcite .",
    "one of the major sources of excitement in quantum optics has been tracing effects that can be explained only on the grounds of the fully quantum theory of light and matter . a standard reference point here",
    "is the semiclassical theory of photodetection , in which a quantized material system interacts with light treated classically .",
    "this theory suffices to explain a wealth of optical observations in systems comprising stochastic classical fields , linear optical elements , and typical photodetectors @xcite .",
    "a direct demonstration of the quantum nature of light requires one to resort to more exotic ways to generate and manipulate light @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical regime can be viewed as a special case of a local realistic theory , and its bounds are typically tighter , as discussed in detail for two - photon interference effects @xcite .",
    "however , the semiclassical regime can be easily implemented in an optical laboratory using readily available resources , unlike other models considered in general local realistic theories which may include highly speculative assumptions .    when identifying the limits of the semiclassical regime , it is crucial to take into account a realistic description of the employed components .",
    "for example , most detectors with single photon sensitivity do not have photon number resolution . as a result",
    ", intensity correlations typical for non - classical sources of optical radiation can be mimicked by suitably engineered non - stationary classical fields , and additional tests of quantumness are needed @xcite .",
    "a thorough study of the actual construction details of standard photon counting modules can even provide a complete control over their behaviour using classical light @xcite , which leads to new eavesdropping strategies for quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that understanding the precise borders between semiclassical , local realistic , and quantum regimes remains full of challenges that grow out of previous advances in quantum optics and are highly relevant to emerging quantum - enhanced technologies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the question to what degree the semiclassical regime can reproduce polarization correlations .",
    "such correlations are a celebrated signature of quantumness @xcite and nowadays can be routinely observed for photon pairs produced in a suitably arranged process of parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "typical for most quantum optical experiments , we will assume here that the photodetectors provide only a binary response telling whether at least one photon has been detected or none at all @xcite .",
    "the probability of a click is a non - linear function of the incident intensity .",
    "this can be viewed as a generalization of the malus law @xcite considered within the semiclassical theory .",
    "the theoretical discussion is illustrated with a photon counting measurement performed on a pair of collectively depolarized light beams that provide the strongest form of polarization correlations allowed in the semiclassical regime .",
    "the quest to understand the exact relation between the classical and the quantum has been vigorously pursued by and will remain an important element of the scientific legacy of late krzysztof wdkiewicz . this contribution is dedicated to his memory .",
    "the notion of correlations in classical physics is reserved to the statistical description of systems for which complete knowledge is _ not available_. the state of a system is said to be correlated whenever the joint probability distribution describing parameters of the entire system does not factorize into marginal probability distributions for individual subsystems .",
    "if the complete knowledge about the system is available , the probability distribution is clearly a product of marginal probability distributions , since the state of each subsystems is definite and hence no correlations are present .    according to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics , the complete knowledge of a quantum system",
    "is encoded in a vector @xmath2 in an appropriate hilbert space .",
    "the superposition principle together with the tensor product structure of composite states implies the existence of _ entangled states_a unique quantum concept comprising the complete knowledge about the composite system and correlations within .",
    "the strength of correlations present in entangled states may well outperform any conceivable classical ones and therefore they provide an argument for the incompatibility of local realistic theories with the quantum world via bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest and at the same time the most characteristic examples of an entangled state is the _",
    "singlet state_. when realized in the polarization degree of freedom of two photons , the singlet state reads : @xmath3 where the kets @xmath4 and @xmath5 correspond to the horizontal and the vertical polarization states respectively , and the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 refer to the two photons that are assumed to be distinguishable by another degree of freedom , for example the direction of propagation .",
    "a feature that distinguishes the singlet state from other two - photon entangled states is its invariance under arbitrary polarization transformations , provided that the same transformation is applied to both the photons .",
    "consequently , the anticorrelations present in the horizontal - vertical basis in eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlet ] ) manifest themselves also in any other basis the polarization is being measured .",
    "more generally , let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be two bloch vectors of unit length representing the polarization basis in which the polarizations are being measured on the two photons respectively .",
    "it is easy to verify that the density operator corresponding to the singlet state can be written as a special case of a two - qubit werner state @xcite @xmath10 with @xmath11 . in the above formula , @xmath12",
    "are pauli operators .",
    "this representation allows us to calculate in a straightforward way , using trace properties of pauli operators , the joint probability of measuring the two photons in respective polarizations @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath13 \\\\ = \\frac{1}{4}[1 + \\eta { \\bf u}_a \\cdot { \\bf u}_b ] \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes a three - component vector composed of the pauli operators .",
    "thus the joint probability for polarization settings @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a function of the angle @xmath15 between the corresponding bloch vectors , given by @xmath16 .",
    "when performing a _ common _ transformation on both measured polarizations @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the probability is left unchanged .",
    "it is seen that the visibility of polarization correlations is given by @xmath17 , reaching @xmath1 for the singlet state . the density operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : varrho = sigma ] ) is positive definite for @xmath18 .",
    "thus although perfect _ anticorrelations _ in the polarization degree of freedom are possible , there is no physical quantum state in which the two photons would always have identical polarizations in an arbitrary basis .",
    "let us consider a pair of light beams distributed between two parties @xmath6 and @xmath7 . because of the employed detection scheme , it will be sufficient to take into account only the intensity and the polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "classically , a general state of polarization is described by a four - component stokes vector . for a fully polarized beam the component corresponding to the total intensity",
    "is unambiguously defined by the remaining three coordinates . in order to retain correspondence with the quantum mechanical case , we will order these coordinates identically as in the bloch vectors and we will call here the resulting three - component objects _ generalized _ bloch vectors .",
    "thus an individual preparation of the two beams is described by generalized bloch vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 , whose length corresponds to the intensity , and the direction  to the polarization state of the respective beam .",
    "if the complete knowledge about the beams is unavailable , the joint state is described by a probability distribution @xmath21 . in the following",
    ", we shall assume that the state is invariant with respect to an arbitrary common polarization transformation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 belongs to the so(3 ) group of proper rotations in three real dimensions .",
    "the measurement is performed by selecting polarization components corresponding to @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the respective beams , and detecting clicks using single photon counting modules . assuming that the detector fires whenever one or more photons are detected , the click probability for the classical light of normalized intensity @xmath24 entering the detector reads @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the probability of a coincidence event in the semiclassical model is given by @xmath26 detector losses are described by multiplying the argument of @xmath27 by the detection efficiency , which can be included in the above formula by appropriate rescaling of the probability @xmath28 .",
    "let us now represent @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a reference unit vector , @xmath31 is a certain rotation , and @xmath32 .",
    "writing the integration measure as @xmath33 and making use of the assumed rotational invariance of @xmath28 allows us to write @xmath34 substituting @xmath35 yields : @xmath36 it will be convenient to assume in the following that the measure over @xmath31 is normalized to one , @xmath37 . using the explicit form of the count probability @xmath27 , the integral over @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : probsc ] ) can be simplified to @xmath38 where the only term depending on the polarizations @xmath8 and @xmath9 being measured reads @xmath39 this integral can be calculated explicitly when @xmath40 , leading to a closed expression for the coincidence probability @xmath41 of the form @xmath42,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the angle between the vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : coinc ] we depict the dependence of the @xmath41 on the angle @xmath15 for several values of the intensity @xmath24 . in order to aid comparison",
    ", the graphs have been rescaled by the the probability @xmath44 of a coincidence event when the polarizers are removed from the setup .",
    "it is seen than the correlations are much weaker than in the quantum mechanical case of a singlet state , and for larger intensities they loose the purely harmonic form .",
    "note that choosing @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : udef ] ) leads to an expression analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : coinccurve ] ) with @xmath46 replaced by @xmath47",
    ".    we will now derive bounds on @xmath48 for arbitrary generalized bloch vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which will be used to analyze the visibility of polarization correlations in a more general case . in order to find a lower bound on @xmath48",
    "let us start from an observation that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : udef ] ) is invariant under the substitution @xmath49 .",
    "taking @xmath50 to be a @xmath51 rotation around the axis perpendicular to the plane spanned by @xmath30 and @xmath9 implies that the value of @xmath48 does not change under simultaneous substitutions @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this allows us to write : @xmath54 using the convexity of the hyperbolic cosine function and the inverse triangle inequality we obtain @xmath55 evaluating the two integrals over @xmath23 yields @xmath56.\\ ] ] an upper bound on @xmath48 can be found with the help of the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath57 the two derived bounds allow us to estimate from above and from below the coincidence probability @xmath41 over all possible settings of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let us first discuss the limit of weak intensities @xmath58 , when the probability of a click on a detector can be approximated by @xmath59 . in this case",
    ", the probability of a coincidence event can be written as @xmath60 where the angular brackets denote the average @xmath61 .",
    "the cauchy - schwarz inequality means that @xmath62 , which implies that the visibility can not exceed @xmath0 .    in a symmetric scenario ,",
    "when both the beams always have orthogonal polarizations and equal intensities @xmath63 , we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : coinccurve ] ) to calculate the visibility of polarization correlations @xmath64 this quantity , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : visibility ] , is a monotonically decreasing function of the intensity @xmath24 , with the maximum value @xmath65 reached in the limit @xmath66 .",
    "note that in this scenario the bounds given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : umin ] ) and ( [ eq : umax ] ) are tight .",
    "more generally , we can use the inequalities derived in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : umin ] ) and ( [ eq : umax ] ) to find an upper bound on the visibility of polarization correlations for arbitrary intensities @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this bound is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundplot ] .",
    "it is seen that the visibility indeed does not exceed @xmath0 except regions when one of the intensities @xmath67 or @xmath68 is small .",
    "let us have a closer look at the limit when one of the intensities approaches zero . for concreteness ,",
    "let us take @xmath69 .",
    "it is then justified to expand @xmath70 this expression can be evaluated analytically to yield @xmath71    , @xmath72 , half and quarter wave plates ; wp , a wave plate introducing an @xmath73  rad phase shift ; pbs , polarizing beam splitters ; spcm , single photon counting modules . ]",
    "it is seen that the minimum and the maximum values of the coincidence probability are obtained when the product @xmath74 .",
    "it can be verified by a straightforward yet lengthy calculation that the visibility of polarization correlations obtained using this expression approaches @xmath0 when @xmath69 .",
    "this shows that the upper bound derived with the help of the inequalities given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : umin ] ) and ( [ eq : umax ] ) is not tight and suggests that the limit @xmath0 might be universal for arbitrary intensities @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "let us note that the bound @xmath0 does not discriminate between positive and negative polarization correlations .",
    "the quantum mechanical counterpart a statistical ensemble discussed above is a situation when each of the two photons has a well defined polarization state , and only statistical averaging is permitted , i.e.  the pair is prepared in a _",
    "separable state_. for werner states introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : varrho = sigma ] ) the separability criterion takes a form symmetric with respect to the sign of the parameter @xmath75 : @xmath76 @xcite , also leading to the visibility limit of @xmath0 for polarization correlations .",
    "of the polarizer pbs2 placed in the path of the beam @xmath7 .",
    "the three panels display results for scans of the polarization of the beam @xmath7 along the great circles in the @xmath77 plane ( top ) , the @xmath78 plane ( middle ) , and the @xmath79 plane ( bottom ) .",
    "the solid lines depict least - squares sinusoidal fits .",
    "the insets specify the polarization of the beam @xmath6 for each of the datasets along with visibilities obtained from the fits . ]",
    "the semiclassical limit of polarization correlations can be demonstrated experimentally using a pair of orthogonally polarized light beams , submitted to identical polarization transformations selected randomly according to the haar measure on the rotation group so(3 ) .",
    "mechanical implementation @xcite of such depolarization would lead to excessively long averaging times .",
    "however , for low intensities , when the probability of a count is proportional to the incident intensity , the polarization measurement is sensitive only to certain moments of the distribution of output polarizations : @xmath80 these moments can be reproduced by a discrete set of bloch vectors , or a continuous one - parameter family .",
    "the latter solution is a convenient choice for an implementation in an optical setup .",
    "an exemplary realization is a set of two waveplates with phase delays equal respectively to @xmath73  rad and @xmath51  rad that rotate in opposite directions with the same constant angular velocities . for a suitably selected input linear polarization",

    "the polarizing beam splitter pbs1 followed by a silver mirror was used to prepare two parallel beams in horizontal @xmath83 and vertical @xmath84 polarizations with respect to the plane of the setup .",
    "the half wave plate inserted before pbs1 served to equalize the intensities of the two beams .",
    "the two wave plates introducing depolarization were mounted on rotation stages driven by stepper motors . in order to produce the correct output ensemble ,",
    "the axes of the waveplates were initially aligned parallel to each other . for each measurement point , the waveplates were rotated in opposite directions with constant angular velocities , completing an integer number of 10 full rotations .",
    "the two emerging beams were transmitted through separate quarter wave plates @xmath72 followed by polarizers , which selected individual polarization components , and then focused on the active areas of single photon counting modules spcm ( model perkin elmer spcm - aq-131 ) .",
    "the input beam was attenuated to an intensity at which single count rates on the spcms with removed polarizers were approximately equal to @xmath85  hz . given the laser repetition rate of @xmath86 this yields the intensity parameter @xmath87 .    in order to verify the correlations , we chose six different polarizations for the beam @xmath6 : horizontal @xmath83 , vertical @xmath84 , diagonal at @xmath88 degrees @xmath89 and @xmath90 , as well as right- and left - circular @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "for each of these six polarizations , we measured coincidence count rates as a function of the polarization selected for the beam @xmath7 sweeping one of three great circles on the bloch sphere , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circles ] .",
    "the great circles were scanned by setting the quarter wave plate in the beam @xmath7 to an the appropriate orientation or removing it altogether for the scan of the @xmath77 circle , and rotating the polarizer pbs2 in 10  steps , which corresponds to 20  increments on a great circle . for each setting , photocounts were collected over a @xmath93 time interval , and both single and coincidence count numbers were recorded .    the measured polarization correlations are depicted in fig .",

    "we investigated the strength of polarization correlations that can be achieved using classical optical fields and detectors without photon number resolution .",
    "we showed under certain symmetry assumptions that there is a substantial gap between the semiclassical regime and the correlations allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the maximum value @xmath0 of the visibility of polarization correlations is lower than the bound of @xmath95 in local realistic theories required to satisfy standard bell s inequalities .",
