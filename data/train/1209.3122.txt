    "<S> [ fig : clath_n_max](a ) we see that , for the most flexible membrane , there is a similar enhancement of assembly for higher @xmath37 as for cores . however , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : clath_n_max](b ) , in contrast to cores , the enhancement remains as @xmath38 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the results for all intermediate @xmath38 were very similar ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the ability of the clathrin - like sub - units to form structures with a range of curvatures : as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : clath_snapshots](b ) , at lower @xmath38 the sub - units form roughly spherical structures which enclose membrane buds . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at @xmath51 , these are often nearly closed , with the membrane in the bud connected to the rest by a very narrow neck ( see appendix ) . at intermediate @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> , we observe the formation of more open , curved structures , or pits , on the membrane , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : clath_snapshots](c ) , whereas at high @xmath38 the sub - units form extended , approximately flat structures lying on the membrane surface , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : clath_snapshots](d ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : clath_n_max](c ) and ( d ) we plot the average of the asphericity of the largest sub - unit cluster , @xmath70 , for @xmath59 and @xmath46 . for low @xmath37 and higher @xmath32 there is a region for all @xmath38 where @xmath74 , corresponding to closed cage structures , not attached to the membrane . for higher @xmath37 , </S>",
    "<S> non - closed structures bound to the membrane are formed . at lower @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> these remain somewhat spherical , whilst for @xmath67 they are a lot less so .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we described a simple coarse - grained model to simulate the effect of a membrane on the assembly of proteinaceous sub - units . </S>",
    "<S> we used this model to investigate the assembly of structures that share key features with viral cores and clathrin . in both cases we found that attraction to the membrane </S>",
    "<S> may enhance assembly in regions without bulk assembly . for cores , this effect shows an interesting non - monotonic dependence on membrane rigidity , being reduced for very deformable membranes and disappearing for the stiffest , in contrast to extended crystalline structures with attractive walls . for clathrin - like particles </S>",
    "<S> , the promotion of assembly persists for less deformable membranes . </S>",
    "<S> the difference to cores is due to the ability of clathrin - like particles to form structures with different curvatures . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observed the formation of biologically relevant buds for both cores and clathrin - like particles . in the case of cores , we found that these do not occur if the membrane is very flexible , whilst for clathrin - like particles their morphology depends on membrane - flexibility .    </S>",
    "<S> the formation of buds on membranes is crucial in various biological processes , for example endocytosis , in which , in some organisms , clathrin plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> endocytosis is a complex process involving the collaborative binding of variety of proteins to the membrane  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the demonstration of bud - formation through assembly in our simulations opens the possibility that simple , patchy - particle models could capture basic features of such processes , giving new insight . </S>",
    "<S> the effects described might also be experimentally observed by mixing patchy colloids @xcite with giant vesicles  @xcite , whose bending rigidity  @xcite lies well within the range considered . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , our results clearly demonstrate that membranes can have a profound impact on self - assembly and will hopefully stimulate further study in this direction . in future </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting to investigate the dynamics of membrane - influenced assembly .    </S>",
