    "low - frequency radio telescopes have relatively large fields - of - view , because the telescope primary beam size scales with wavelength . current high - resolution ( sub - arcminute ) radio interferometers that operate at sub - ghz frequencies , like the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , the low - frequency array ( lofar ) , or the very large array ( vla ) , have field diameters measured in ( sometimes tens of ) degrees . typical challenges of handling high - resolution , low - frequency continuum observations are ( i ) imaging and deconvolving many sources inside ( and outside ! ) the large primary beam area , ( ii ) direction - dependent ( dd ) visibility amplitude and phase variations across the field - of - view due to antenna beam patterns , pointing errors , ionosphere , etc . , and the abundance of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .    processing data coming from these telescopes can be daunting , since all the challenges mentioned above ( and more ) needs to be dealt with at the same time . in data reduction ,",
    "the _ art _ is to determine at any given time which effect is dominant in limiting the image quality .",
    "generally , a few _ big effects _ stand out and are generally easy to identify and fix .",
    "but subsequenty , many _ smaller effect _ will present themelves , which may be more difficult to recognize , and harder to identify and disentangle .",
    "a effective way to mitigate the smaller effects is to perform iterations of ( dd ) calibration , imaging and flagging , in each step refining the quality of both the visibility data and the reconstructed sky model .",
    "developments towards a semi - automated data reduction package started in 2006 , driven by the complicated reduction of gmrt 150 mhz observations on galaxy cluster abell 2256 ( and other similar data sets ) .",
    "several challenges presented themselves at the same time : ( i ) the target contains faint , diffuse emission in the presence of bright interfering sources , ( ii ) the data was strongly affected by rfi on many baselines , ( iii ) the data was strongly affected by ionospheric phase distortions , ( iv ) the data was affected by instrumental instabilities .",
    "it quickly became clear that this data required an algorithm to correct for ionospheric phase errors , and possibly other dd effects .",
    "simultaneously followed the desire to automate several trivial but very time - consuming data reduction steps .    for the basis of these new developments a stable data reduction package",
    "was sought , with the possibility to easily expand the functionality .",
    "this was found in the combination of the data reduction package aips @xcite and the powerful high - level programming language python ( and its standard scientific libraries like scipy , pylab , matplotlib , and numpy ) , with the parseltongue interface @xcite providing access to aips tasks , data files ( images and visibilities ) and tables from python .",
    "a new python module was created named _ spam _ , an acronym for _ source peeling and atmospheric modeling _ , encapsulating high - level data reduction functions and new algorithm development .",
    "spam - based data reductions , i.e. for gmrt observations , have been captured in python scripts that execute aips tasks directly ( mostly during initial reduction steps ) , call high - level functions that encompass multiple aips /parseltongue calls , and require few manual operations . these scripted data reductions automatically keep a history of the data reduction steps , and provide a standard that is well - tested and reproducible . at the same time , the spam user is required to perform some manual steps , and can easily decide to change the order of data reduction steps depending on the target field geometry and the intended science , therefore the term data reduction _ recipe _ is more appropriate than _ pipeline_. note that spam assumes an unpolarized sky , observed with limited ( @xmath0  percent ) fractional bandwidth .",
    "spam recipes are available for all sub - ghz gmrt frequencies , developed and refined over the last several years , with minimal differences between frequencies .",
    "the general structure of this data reduction is described in , and includes _ measuring _ dd ionospheric phase errors through peeling of bright sources within the science field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ modeling _ these errors with a single- or multi - layer ionospheric phase model , and _ applying _ ionospheric phase corrections during wide - field ( re-)imaging of the science field ( see section  [ sec : ioncal ] ) .",
    "a combination of rfi- and bad data mitigation routines are used inbetween rounds of calibration and imaging . _",
    "classical outlier removal _ excises visibilities mostly based on excessive visibility amplitudes and statistical outlier rejection along the time and frequency axes .",
    "subtraction _ models and subtracts low - level , quasi - continuous , ground - based rfi based on its fringe - rotation signature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . and _ ripple killing _ excises bad visibility data based on a combination of high visibility amplitudes , high visibility weights and high imaging weights ( i.e. , though uniform weighting ) .",
    "this is done by fourier - transforming residual images back onto the uv - plane , identifying high - amplitude uv - cells , and rejecting all visibilities that fall in these cells .",
    "a more elaborate description will be given in an upcoming paper ( intema et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .      following @xcite there are four ionospheric calibration regimes , depending on the size of the radio interferometer array and the size of the field - of - view , both relative to the scale of phase structure in the ionosphere .",
    "this makes most sense when imagining a single horizontal density wave ( or a bubble ) in a thin layer at a fixed height .",
    "regime  4 is the most complex case , when both the horizontal size of the array and the projected field - of - view at ionospheric height are similar or larger than the horizontal scale of the ionospheric phase structure . in this regime , when looking towards a single source in the field - of - view , the higher - order phase structure over the array will cause both an apparent position shift and a source deformation .",
    "when looking at a second source in the same field - of - view at sufficient distance from the first , both the apparent position shift and the source distortion will be different .",
    "the spam ionospheric calibration strategy is designed to operate in regime  4 , meaning that it will also work in the less complex regimes 13 . in an automated peeling routine",
    ", measurements of the ionospheric phase structure are obtained by phase calibrating on ( typically 1020 ) bright sources within the field - of - view . per time",
    "interval ( typically 1020  seconds ) , the measured phases of all source  antenna pairs are mapped onto a common domain along their line - of - sight , i.e. , at the pierce points through a virtual phase screen at fixed height .",
    "the phases are fit with an optimized set of base functions , reproducing the measured phases , and predicting dd phases corrections in arbitrary viewing directions during imaging .",
    "the automated wide - field imager applies any relevant dd phase corrections on the fly in a modified version of polyhedron ( facet - based ) imaging and cotton - schwab clean deconvolution ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "the intrinsic book - keeping issues of faceted imaging are largely hidden from the user .",
    "the imager also includes an iterative , robust clean boxing scheme , and simultaneous imaging of the primary beam area and bright outlier fields . in principle",
    ", the generic imager can handle other dd effects as well , like asymmetric primary beams or pointing errors , as long as a model is available to generate the dd correction tables .",
    "spam is an aips - based python package that provides semi - automated data reduction scripts for all sub - ghz frequencies at gmrt .",
    "apart from well - tested standard data reduction steps , spam includes direction - dependent ( ionospheric ) calibration and imaging , and alternative rfi- and bad data mitigation methods . with spam ,",
    "gmrt data reductions are highly efficient , highly reproducible , and give good quality results .",
    "spam is available for everyone to use .",
    "spam for casa , currently under development , will also provide wide - bandwidth ionospheric calibration , direction - dependent ionospheric faraday rotation calibration , and will naturally benefit from the advanced modes ( and continuous improvements ) of the casa imager ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ."
