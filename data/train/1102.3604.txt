    "in his seminal papers @xcite , berlekamp introduced negacyclic codes over odd prime fields @xmath8 , and designed a decoding algorithm that corrects up to @xmath9 lee errors .",
    "the main idea in berlekamp s contribution is to represent error patterns of weight @xmath10 solely by error locator polynomials of degree @xmath10 , where the error values are encoded essentially in the multiplicity of the respective error locations .",
    "berlekamp s error locator polynomial satisfies some type of key equation that is solved during the decoding procedure .",
    "its solution ultimately depends on the multiplicative invertibility of all odd integers @xmath11 in ( a field extension of ) @xmath8 where @xmath6 is the maximum lee weight of all correctable error patterns .",
    "this finally requires @xmath12 , which is the reason why this idea yields only a very small class of useful codes .",
    "the project underlying this article revisits berlekamp s work and starts with the observation that almost all of the algebra used in the quoted papers is still valid in a galois ring , i.e.  a galois extension of the integers modulo @xmath13 where @xmath14 might be greater than  @xmath15 .",
    "the divisibility condition mentioned above causes problems if and only if @xmath16 is odd , and this brought us to the idea to study codes over @xmath17 .",
    "the paper at hand considers the simplest ( non - trivial ) case , namely the case where @xmath18 , which means we consider negacyclic codes over @xmath5 under the lee metric .",
    "we will show that a negacyclic code is indeed of minimum lee distance at least @xmath1 if its generator polynomial has roots @xmath19 for a primitive @xmath3th root of unity @xmath4 in a galois extension of @xmath5 .",
    "no restriction on @xmath6 will be imposed .",
    "we present an algebraic decoding algorithm for this class of codes that corrects any error pattern of lee weight @xmath7 .",
    "throughout this paper , let @xmath20 denote the galois ring @xmath21 of characteristic  @xmath0 , order @xmath22 , and residue field @xmath23 .",

    "this group , in union with zero , forms the so - called _ teichmller set _ of @xmath20 , which we denote by @xmath30 .",
    "the set @xmath30 forms a complete set of coset representatives of @xmath31 in @xmath20 and so the image of @xmath32 under @xmath33 is the residue field @xmath26 .",
    "each element @xmath34 can be expressed in the canonical form @xmath35 for suitable @xmath36 .",
    "the automorphism group of @xmath20 is cyclic of order @xmath14 and with respect to the above canonical form is generated by the map @xmath37 note that for an element @xmath38 of @xmath39 we have @xmath40 .",
    "we remark that @xmath20 does not contain an element of order  @xmath0 : suppose @xmath41 has order  @xmath0 where @xmath42 , then @xmath43 has order  @xmath44 , which is impossible as the order of an element in @xmath30 must divide @xmath29 .",
    "the following is a bch - like description of negacyclic codes over  @xmath5 , and can be read as the obvious extension of berlekamp s work in @xcite .",
