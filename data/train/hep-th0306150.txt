    "the moduli space of a supersymmetric system is defined as the set of classically massless , or light , degrees of freedom .",
    "the beauty of this concept lies in the fact that much of the low - energy behaviour of the system may be encoded as geometrical features on the moduli space . whether the subject be string compactifications , the dynamics of gauge theories , or the interactions of solitons , the moduli space approximation provides an effective , and tractable , approach to extract the infra - red quantum properties of the system .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    one particularly useful geometric feature of the moduli space is the metric , describing the kinetic interactions of the system .",
    "our interest in this paper will be focused on the moduli space of solitons , specifically vortices . in this case , the relevance of the metric was first revealed by manton who showed that geodesics on the moduli space track the classical scattering of solitons @xcite .    [ [ section-1 ] ]    it is common lore that for dynamics exhibiting 8 or more supercharges , the metric on the moduli space is exactly calculable . for theories with 4 supercharges or less ,",
    "the metric can , in general , only be computed in asymptotic regimes . in the context of solitons , both yang - mills instantons and monopoles",
    "preserve up to 8 supercharges and indeed exact , albeit somewhat implicit , expressions for the metrics are known using the techniques of @xcite . in contrast , vortices preserve a maximum of only 4 supercharges , and knowledge of the metric is currently restricted to the situation where the solitons are well - separated @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    nevertheless , it is possible to make progress in supersymmetric quantum field theories even when the moduli space metric is not known .",
    "this is because , as first emphasised by witten @xcite , many of the simplest quantities of interest depend only on topological characteristics of the moduli space .",
    "for example , the supersymmetric bound states of solitons are related to various cohomology classes of the moduli space @xcite normalisability mean that asymptotic behaviour of the metric is also required . ] .",
    "similarly non - perturbative contributions to bps correlation functions , which involve integrals over the moduli space of instantons , often reduce to topological invariants @xcite .",
    "thus , for many purposes it suffices to know only crude topological information about the moduli space .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    the purpose of this paper is to describe the moduli space of vortices in @xmath1 yang - mills - higgs theories where the gauge group is broken completely by @xmath5 fundamental scalar fields .",
    "the theory has a mass gap and exhibits vortices , labeled by the winding number @xmath0 of the magnetic field ,  b = -2k [ first]here we summarise our main results .",
    "we start in section 2 with a study of the moduli space of charge @xmath6 vortices which we shall denote as @xmath7 .",
    "our first result concerns the real dimension of the moduli space which , using index theory techniques , we show to be ( v_k , n)=2kn [ dim]in section 3 we present a brane construction of the vortices , from which we extract a description of @xmath8 as a @xmath3 symplectic quotient of @xmath9 .",
    "this quotient construction is most easily described as the higgs branch of a @xmath3 gauge theory with four supercharges , coupled to a single adjoint chiral multiplet and @xmath5 fundamental chiral multiplets .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    the moduli space @xmath8 naturally inherits a metric from the khler quotient construction .",
    "this does not agree with the manton metric describing the classical scattering of solitons .",
    "given our discussion above , this is neither unexpected nor an obstacle to utilising our construction for further calculations . as we shall see , the inherited metric is a deformation of the manton metric , preserving the khler property , the isometries and the asymptotic form .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the parametric scaling of the dimension ( [ dim ] ) is reminiscent of the moduli space of @xmath0 instantons in a @xmath1 gauge theory , which we shall denote as @xmath10 .",
    "recall that the real dimension of the instanton moduli space is ( i_k , n)=4kn moreover , those familiar with instanton moduli spaces will have recognised the quotient construction of @xmath8 as a truncated version of the adhm quotient @xcite . in section 4 , we make this relationship more explicit and show that the moduli space of vortices @xmath8 is a complex middle - dimensional submanifold ( or , since @xmath10 is hyperkhler , equivalently a special lagrangian submanifold ) of the resolved instanton moduli space @xmath10 .",
    "we further show that @xmath8 may be realised as the fixed point set of a holomorphic @xmath2 action on @xmath10 , descending from the rotations of instantons in a plane .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    in section 5 , we generalise this construction to vortices in @xmath1 gauge theories with @xmath11 flavours . for abelian gauge theories ,",

    "the dimension of the moduli space is , ( _ k,(n , m))=2k(n+m ) .",

    "we describe how the moduli space of vortices changes as @xmath19 is varied .",
    "we show that the moduli spaces may become singular , cease to exist , or undergo interesting topology changing transitions for different values of @xmath19 .",
    "we end in section 7 with conclusions and a discussion .",

    "these vortices obey a bogomolnyi bound which is the natural generalisation of the usual abelian vortex bound @xcite and may be simply determined by the standard trick of completing the square in the hamiltonian .",
    "it will turn out that the most general vortex solutions involve only the fields @xmath25 and @xmath39 , and we choose to set the remaining fields to zero at this stage . restricting to time independent configurations , the hamiltonian reads , & = & tr + & = & tr + & & 2|k| where @xmath40 is the winding number of the configuration defined in ( [ first ] ) . choosing @xmath6 ,",

    "the number of zero modes is therefore independent of @xmath46 and we use this freedom to set @xmath47 which simplifies the linearised bogomolnyi equations somewhat so they can be written as , (    ccid^a_|z & -q^r + q^r & id_z^f    ) (    c _ z +    ) = 0 where the superscript in @xmath48 denotes the fact that the matrix @xmath25 acts as right multiplication .",

    "taubes showed long ago that , as expected , the collective coordinates of @xmath8 correspond to the positions of @xmath0 unit charge vortices moving on the plane and may be identified with the zeros of the higgs field @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the metric on @xmath67 can be shown to be geodesically complete and although the exact form of the metric remains unknown for @xmath68 , several interesting properties were uncovered by samols @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , the metric approaches the flat metric on @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the permutation group of @xmath0 elements , reflecting the fact that the vortices are indistinguishable particles .",
    "the interactions of the vortices resolve the orbifold singularities of @xmath69 as the cores overlap . the leading order corrections to the flat metric , which are exponentially suppressed in the separation between vortices ,",
    "were recently calculated by manton and speight @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    the moduli space of vortices in the non - abelian yang - mills - higgs model does not appear to have been studied in the literature . here",
    "we make a few elementary remarks .",
    "the dimension @xmath71 suggests that the charge @xmath0 vortex again decomposes into @xmath0 unit charge vortices , each of which is alloted a position on the plane together with @xmath72 complex internal degrees of freedom describing the orientation of the vortex in the @xmath73 group .",
    "indeed the action @xmath73 on the fields descends to a natural action on @xmath64 , resulting in a holomorphic @xmath74 isometry of the metric @xmath66 . for @xmath68",
    ", there is a further isometry of @xmath64 resulting from spatial rotations of the vortices .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    let us examine the moduli space of a single vortex in further detail",
    ". given a specific solution @xmath75 to the abelian vortex equations , one can always construct a solution to the non - abelian equations ( [ bog ] ) by simply embedding @xmath75 in the upper - left corner of the @xmath31 matrices @xmath61 and @xmath25 . in the case of a single vortex @xmath76 , acting on this configuration with the @xmath73 symmetry sweeps out the full moduli space of solutions .",
    "since the vortex embedded in the upper - left corner breaks @xmath77 , the vortex moduli space is _ 1,nsu(n)/(su(n-1)u(1))^n-1 endowed with the round fubini - study metric .",

    "the two mass scales of the field theory are the mass of the photon @xmath91 and the mass of the vortex @xmath92 .",

    "= 4.5 in    [ [ section-28 ] ]    the effect of this tilt on the theory on the d1-branes is to change the fi parameter @xmath111 , which is now given ( up to a normalisation of @xmath251 - see ( [ rel2 ] ) ) by the distance between the end of the d1-brane and the left - hand ns5-brane .",
    "the displacement @xmath252 of the d1-brane from its original position was calculated in @xcite , and is given by = - with the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath36 still defined in terms of the distances @xmath253 and @xmath254 between the ns5-branes as in ( [ rel1 ] ) , we find the promised result , r=2(+ ) .",
    "[ ohyes]we now turn to studying some simple consequences of this equation .",
    "consider first the vortices of section 2 , in which we have a @xmath1 gauge group with @xmath5 hypermultiplets .",
    "the most striking feature is that the vortex moduli space only exists for @xmath255 or , alternatively , for @xmath19 above the critical value @xmath256 > _ c = -1/e^2moreover , at the critical value @xmath257 , the moduli space becomes singular .",
    "for example , in the abelian case @xmath43 , we have @xmath258 , endowed with the flat , singular metric at @xmath257 .",
    "in fact neither of these results are new : both were previously derived in the abelian @xmath43 theories by bak , lee and park by an explicit study of the solutions to the non - commutative bogomolnyi equations @xcite ( see also the phase diagram in @xcite ) .",
    "it is pleasing to see these properties reproduced from our d1-brane theory . from equation ( [ ohyes ] ) it is also clear that vortex moduli space @xmath8 is non - singular in the @xmath214 limit provided @xmath259 .",
    "this point was previously made in @xcite and the manton metric on @xmath67 was explicitly calculated in this limit . once again , the manton metric differs from the metric induced on the higgs branch by the khler quotient construction .",
    "for example , in the case of two vortices , the non - commutative metric in the @xmath235 limit takes the form of a cone ( [ cone ] ) , now with the conformal factor given by f^2()=(^2/2)-1 - 2 ^ 2e^-^2+  which coincides with neither ( [ 2vort ] ) nor ( [ man2vort ] ) .",
    "[ [ section-29 ] ]    we now turn to the consequences of ( [ ohyes ] ) for semi - local vortices .",
    "firstly , note that if we set @xmath214 so that we are studying the moduli space of sigma - model lumps , then the non - commutivity parameter @xmath19 resolves the singularities just as in the case of yang - mills instantons .",
    "similar observations were made from a field theory perspective in @xcite .",
    "however , for semi - local vortices the moduli space defined by the d - term ( [ semid ] ) continues to make sense for @xmath237 or , alternatively , for @xmath260 .",
    "moreover , the topology of the moduli space differs for @xmath231 and @xmath237 .",
    "thus , as we decrease the non - commutivity parameter @xmath19 past its critical value of @xmath261 , the moduli space of non - commutative vortices undergoes a topology changing transition . a familiar example of this occurs for a single @xmath76 semi - local vortex in a @xmath262 gauge theory with 4 hypermultiplets . in this case the moduli space is related to the calabi - yau 3-fold known to string theorists simply as the conifold . for @xmath232 , it is the singular space defined by the complex equation @xmath263 .",
    "the fi parameter resolves the singularity and we have , _ 1,(2,2)o(-1)o(-1)^1 as we decrease the non - commutivity parameter @xmath19 to pass from @xmath231 to @xmath237 , the moduli space of vortices undergoes a flop transition . for other values of @xmath5 and @xmath222 ,",
    "the topology change is more dramatic and the moduli space of vortices may have different betti numbers for @xmath231 and @xmath237 .",
    "[ [ section-30 ] ]    finally , note that for @xmath260 the equation ( [ ohyes ] ) implies a duality between different non - commutative gauge theories in the sense that they share the same moduli spaces of vortices .",
    "specifically , consider the @xmath1 theory with @xmath201 flavours .",
    "the moduli space of @xmath0 vortices @xmath15 is defined by the moment map ( [ semid ] ) with fi parameter @xmath111 given by ( [ ohyes ] ) .",
    "for @xmath264 we have @xmath237 . from the d - term ( [ semid ] )",
    "we see that the moduli space of vortices in this theory coincides with the moduli space of vortices in a @xmath265 gauge theory , also with @xmath201 flavours .",
    "( we must also perform a parity transformation in going from the @xmath1 theory to the @xmath265 theory , so that @xmath266 ) .",
    "denote the gauge coupling of the @xmath265 theory as @xmath267 , and the non - commutivity parameter as @xmath268 .",
    "then for the moduli spaces of vortices to coincide , we simply require + ^= -- this duality is , like many , reminiscent of the @xmath269 duality of seiberg .",
    "let us begin this ending with a summary of our results .",
    "we have studied vortices in @xmath1 yang - mills theories with @xmath270 flavours .",
    "these theories have a fi parameter @xmath36 which ensures the gauge group is completely broken in the vacuum .",
    "the gauge coupling parameter is @xmath46 and the theories may be defined on the non - commutative plane with @xmath18=-i\\vartheta$ ] .",
    "[ [ section-31 ] ]    we have shown that the moduli space of charge @xmath0 vortices in this theory is described by the higgs branch of a @xmath3 gauge theory with four supercharges , coupled to @xmath5 chiral multiplets @xmath104 transforming in the @xmath0 representation of the gauge group , @xmath271 chiral multiplets @xmath138 transforming in the @xmath272 representation , and a single chiral multiplet @xmath103 transforming in the adjoint representation . this higgs branch is defined by a @xmath3 symplectic quotient of @xmath273 with moment map , + ^-^ = r [ theend]where the level of the moment map @xmath111 is a fi parameter defined by r=2(+ ) we further showed that the vortex moduli space may be constructed as a complex submanifold ( or , for @xmath274 , a special lagrangian submanifold ) of the moduli space of @xmath0 instantons in non - commutative @xmath238 yang - mills theory .",
    "[ [ section-32 ] ]    relationships between the instanton and vortex equations have been noted in the past . in particular , a reduction of instantons in @xmath178 yang - mills on @xmath275 gives rise to the @xmath2 vortex equations @xcite .",
    "while this relationship appears to share several characteristics of our correspondence , it differs in many important details .",
    "it would be interesting to elucidate the connections between these two approaches .",
    "[ [ section-33 ] ]    as we discussed in detail , the manton metric on the moduli space of vortices does not coincide with the metric induced on the higgs branch ( [ theend ] ) by the khler quotient construction .",
    "indeed , all our experience with gauge theories with four supercharges suggests that it is too ambitious an enterprise to determine the metric on the moduli space of vortices .",
    "other , more topological , questions can be asked with greater success and the construction ( [ theend ] ) provides the answers . as stressed in the introduction ,",
    "these topological questions include certain quantum correlation functions in supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "[ [ section-34 ] ]    given the relationship described in section 4 between the moduli space of vortices and the moduli space of yang - mills instantons , one may expect quantitative agreement between topological correlation functions of two and four dimensional gauge theories .",
    "these would receive non - perturbative instanton corrections in four dimensions , and vortex corrections in two dimensions .",
    "indeed , it is well known that @xmath276 @xmath277 super - yang - mills in four dimensions shares many features with the @xmath100 @xmath12 sigma - model in two dimensions including , most pertinently , its low - energy effective action @xcite .",
    "a second , more quantitative , example was given in @xcite where @xmath278 theories in four dimensions were shown to have a spectrum of monopoles that coincides with the spectrum of kinks in certain @xmath100 theories in two dimensions . both monopole and kink masses receive identical corrections from non - perturbative effects , namely yang - mills instantons and vortices respectively .",
    "it seems likely that the semi - classical reason for these agreements can be traced to the relationship between the vortex and instanton moduli spaces described here .",
