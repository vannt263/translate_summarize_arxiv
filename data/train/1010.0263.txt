    "the discovery of iron based materials has generated enormous interests in the field of superconductivity.@xcite@xmath3@xcite due to similar layered structure to cuprate oxides and rather high @xmath4 , iron based superconductors could host rich vortex phenomena in the mixed state.@xcite@xmath3@xcite recent work suggests that vortex properties of iron based materials seem to be similar to the cuprate superconductors since magnetic flux collective pinning and creep region as well as fishtail effects ( second peak effect ) have been observed in lnofeas ( ln = rare earth elements , 1111 system ) and afe@xmath5as@xmath5 ( a = alkaline earth elements , 122 system).@xcite@xmath3@xcite    iron based superconductors , fese@xmath6 , fe@xmath7te@xmath6se@xmath8 , and fe@xmath7te@xmath6s@xmath8 ( 11 system),@xcite@xmath9@xcite@xmath10@xcite are of interest both for the technological applications and for the understanding of the vortex properties in the mixed state due to rather simple structure and nearly isotropic upper critical field.@xcite@xmath3@xcite only a limited amount of information on the vortex behavior in single crystals of 11 system is available until now , mainly focusing on thermally activated flux flow ( taff ) region in fe(te , se).yadav@xmath9@xcite normal carriers in the vortex core , which experience a lorentz force , can lead to normal hall effect in mixed state . on the other hand , flux flow can also induce hall effect in the mixed state . in detail ,",
    "when applying a transport current , the flux lines will experience the lorentz force , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the supercurrent density and @xmath13 is the magnitude of magnetic induction .",
    "the motion of magnetic flux lines produces a macroscopic electric field @xmath14 which is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the velocity of vortex motion.@xcite the vortex motion along the lorentz force ( perpendicular to @xmath12 ) gives the dissipative field ( @xmath17 ) and generates the flux flow resistivity , whereas the vortex motion along the direction of supercurrent results in the hall electric field ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "therefore the flux flow hall effect ( ffhe ) is a sensitive method to study the vortex dynamics .",
    "there are two exotic phenomena in connection with ffhe in cuprate superconductors .",
    "one is a sign reversal of the hall resistivity @xmath19 below @xmath4.@xcite  this anomaly has also been observed in some conventional superconductors , e.g. amorphous mosi@xmath20,@xcite and 2h - nbse@xmath5.@xcite the sign change is not expected within the classical bardeen - stephen@xcite and nozires - vinennozieres theories of vortex motion , which predict that the hall sign in the superconducting and normal state should be the same .",
    "several models have been proposed for interpreting this anomaly,@xcite@xmath3@xcite however its origin remains a controversy .",
    "another phenomenon is a scaling law between @xmath21 and the longitudinal resistivity @xmath22 in the superconducting transition region , i.e. , @xmath23 with different values of @xmath24 for different materials.@xcite@xmath9@xcite    in this paper , we study the vortex properties of fe@xmath25(te@xmath26s@xmath27)@xmath28 single crystal via taff resistivity and ffhe in the mixed state .",
    "the temperature dependence of tae is different for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , there is a crossover from single - vortex pinning region to collective creep pinning region with increasing magnetic field . on the other hand",
    ", there is no sign reveral and we observe scaling behavior for ffhe .",
    "single crystals of fe(te , s ) were grown by self flux method and their crystal structure was analyzed in the previous report.@xcite the elemental analysis of the crystal used in this study showed the stoichiometry is fe : te : s=1.14(1):0.91(1):0.09(2 ) and we denote it as s-09 in the following for brevity .",
    "electrical transport measurements were performed using a four - probe configuration with current flowing in the ab - plane of tetragonal structure in dc magnetic fields up to 9 t in a quantum design ppms-9 from 1.9 to 200 k and up to 35 t in a he3 cryostat system with resistive magnet down to 0.3 k at the national high magnetic field laboratory ( nhmfl ) in tallahassee , fl .",
    "hall contacts with typical misalignment of less than 0.1 mm were used . at each point",
    "the hall voltage was measured for two directions of the magnetic field , which is always perpendicular to current direction .",
    "1(a , b ) show the resistivity @xmath31 of s-09 near the superconducting transition region for @xmath32 plane and @xmath33 axis . with increasing magnetic fields , the resistivity transition widths are broadened gradually .",
    "the onset of superconductivity shifts to lower temperatures for both magnetic field directions , but the trend is more obvious for @xmath30 than @xmath29 . according to the taff theory , the resistivity in taff region can be expressed as,@xcite@xmath9palstra1@xmath9@xcite@xmath34    where @xmath35 is an attempt frequency for a flux bundle hopping , @xmath36 is the hopping distance , @xmath37 is the magnetic induction , @xmath38 is the applied current density , @xmath39 is the critical current density in the absence of flux creep , @xmath40 is the bundle volume and @xmath41 is the temperature . if @xmath38 is small enough and @xmath42 , we obtain@xmath43    where @xmath44 is the thermally activated energy ( tae ) and @xmath45 , which is usually considered to be temperature - independent . for cuprate superconductors , the prefactor @xmath46 is usually assumed as a constant @xmath47,@xcite therefore , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the external magnetic field . on the other hand , according to the condensation model , palstra2 @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the thermal critical field , @xmath52 is the coherence length , @xmath53 ( @xmath4 is the superconducting transition temperature ) , and @xmath54 depends on the dimensionality of the vortex system with the range from 0 to 3 . since @xmath55 , and @xmath56 near @xmath4,@xcite it is obtained that @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "it is generally assumed that @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 , and the @xmath61 becomes arrhenius relation , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the apparent activation energy .",
    "furthermore , it can be concluded that @xmath65 .",
    "hence , the @xmath66 vs. @xmath67 should be linear in taff region .",
    "the slope is @xmath64 and its y - intercept represents @xmath68 .",
    "of s-09 in different magnetic field directions for @xmath29 and @xmath30 below 10k , respectively .",
    "the corresponding solid and black dashed lines are fitting results from the arrhenius relation  and eq .",
    "( c ) @xmath69 vs @xmath70 derived from arrhenius relation for @xmath29 and @xmath30 . ]    in the figs .",
    "1(a , b ) , the solid lines show the arrhenius relation in taff region .",
    "note that the results are shown in the common logarithmic scale in the figures , but we calculate them in the natural one . all linear fits intersect at approximately the same point @xmath71 , which is about @xmath72 and @xmath73 k for @xmath32 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "assuming the temperature dependences of @xmath75 at two different magnetic fields ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) can be fitted by arrhenius relation , according to above discussion , we get @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath80 , it can be obtained @xmath81 , therefore , ideally , all the lines at different fields should be crossed into same point , @xmath71 , which is equal to @xmath4 . according to the conventional analysis",
    ", the @xmath82 and @xmath4 can be obtained from linear fits @xmath68 and @xmath64 using @xmath63 ( shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) ) . from the fitting results , values of @xmath47 and @xmath4",
    "are @xmath83 @xmath84 , @xmath85 k and @xmath86 @xmath87 , @xmath88 k for @xmath32 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath4 is consistent with the values of @xmath71 in the range of errors .",
    "it seems that the @xmath31 can be fitted with straight lines well .",
    "however , close inspection shows that there is rather large fitting errors , especially for @xmath32 .",
    "the origin of the large errors is the arrhenius relation that can only be satisfied in the limited region and this region is narrower for @xmath32 .",
    "the effects of prefactor and non - linear relation of @xmath89 lead to @xmath31 deviating from arrhenius relation ( vide infra ) .",
    "2(a , b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath90 for both field directions .",
    "because the assumptions @xmath59 and @xmath91 lead to @xmath92 , @xmath64 should be a set of horizontal lines .",
    "we present this in fig .",
    "2(a , b ) over a limited length .",
    "each length covers the temperature interval used for estimating @xmath64 in the arrhenius relation",
    ". it can be seen that @xmath93 increases sharply with decreasing temperature , which was also observed in bi-2212 thin films.@xcite the center of each @xmath64 horizontal line approximately intersects @xmath93 curve and the overlapping region is increasing with temperature decrease .",
    "this shows that each @xmath64 is only the average value of its @xmath94 in the fitting temperature region .",
    "hence , the tae determined from the conventional method does not reflect the true evolution of @xmath89 with the temperature , particularly for @xmath32 .",
    "this contradiction originates from two basic assumptions introduced for arrhenius relation : one is the constant prefactor @xmath95 and another is the linear relation @xmath96 .",
    "et al__@xcite suggested that the temperature - dependent prefactor and nonlinear relation of @xmath97 should be considered . in the following section",
    ", we will analyze the resistivity results using this more general method.@xcite    using the relation @xmath57 , from eq .",
    "( 2 ) it can be derived that    @xmath98    and@xmath99[1+qt/(1-t)]\\ ] ]    where @xmath100 and @xmath70 are temperature independent and @xmath4 derived from arrhenius relation is used for fitting",
    ". therefore , there are three free parameters , @xmath101 , @xmath100 and @xmath70 in eq .",
    "the fitting results are shown in fig .",
    "1 . from fig . 1(a , b ) , it can be seen that all fits are in good agreement with experimental data and the results are better than arrhenius relation .",
    "this is more pronounced for @xmath32 .",
    "2(a , b ) clearly shows the advantage of eq .",
    "( 3 ) over arrhenius relation . the taff formula ( eq . ( 1 ) ) can effectively capture the upturn trend of @xmath102 with decreasing temperature when the ( linear or nonlinear ) correlations between prefactor as well as @xmath89 and @xmath41 are considered . in detail ,",
    "when @xmath103 ( corresponding to @xmath104 , it can be derived that @xmath105 $ ] and when @xmath106 , @xmath107 , i.e. arrhenius relation . because the obtained @xmath108 of s-09 is much smaller than that of cuprates superconductors ( shown in fig .",
    "3 ) and it is comparable with temperature , the assumption @xmath103 can not be satisfied and the temperature dependence of prefactor should be considered .",
    "data in taff region for @xmath109 ( a ) and @xmath30 ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the red solid horizontal lines correspond to obtained @xmath110 from arrhenius relation and the blue dashed lines are plotted using eq .",
    "the parameters are determined via fitting eq .",

    "the @xmath64 shows a power law ( @xmath112 ) field dependence for both directions . for @xmath29 , @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 ; for @xmath30 , @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath116 .",
    "the weak field dependence of @xmath64 in low field for both orientations suggests that single - vortex pinning dominates in this region.@xcite the vortex spacing becomes significantly smaller than penetration depth in higher fields and we expect a crossover to a collective - pinning regime where the activation energy becomes strongly dependent on the field , i.e. , the collective creep dominance.@xcite because @xmath120 is larger than @xmath121 at this regime , it is possible that the flux lines are pinned by the collective point defects in the high field region.@xcite similar crossover has been observed in nd(o , f)feas single crystal.@xcite the values of @xmath101 change from about @xmath121 for @xmath30 to @xmath122 for @xmath29 , independent on the intensity of field for both directions .",
    "the value of @xmath123 has also been observed in many cuprates superconductors.@xcite@xmath9@xcite@xmath9@xcite     and ( b ) @xmath101 as functions of magnetic fields obtained from fitting the resistivity in taff region using eq .",

    "it should be noted that although the fe(te , s ) sample has low volume fraction , it should not have obvious effect on the analysis of taff .",
    "due to the inhomogeneity of sample , the conductivity of sample can be expressed as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the conductivity in superconducting state and @xmath128 is the conductivity of normal state . when @xmath129 , @xmath127 is infinite and thus @xmath130 , i.e. , @xmath131 and the normal state part of sample is short - circuited . on the other hand ,",
    "the resistivity in the taff regime is about one to three orders of magnitude less than normal state@xcite@xmath9@xcite .",
    "it means that although the conductivity @xmath127 in this range is finite , it is still much larger than @xmath128 , and we can obtain @xmath132 .",
    "the hall effect in the mixed state gives important insight in the flux flow . in the following section",
    ", we will discuss the vortex dynamics of s-09 in flux flow region .",
    "the field dependence of the longitudinal resistivity @xmath133 for @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "superconductivity is suppressed by increasing magnetic field up to 35 t and the transition of @xmath22 are shifted to lower magnetic fields at higher temperature . at the lowest measuring temperature ( @xmath134 ) ,",
    "normal state is recovered from superconducting state when field is up to 30 t. fig .",
    "4(b ) shows the hall resistivity at @xmath135 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath136 in low field when temperature is below @xmath4 . at higher field region",
    "close to the superconducting transition , the absolute values of hall resistivity increase and gradually reach the @xmath21 curve obtained in the normal state at temperatures slightly higher than @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath137 in the mixed state shifts with increasing temperature to lower fields .",
    "all of these features are similar to the @xmath22 results . on the other hand ,",
    "the normal state @xmath21 curves are very close to linear , except for low field parts where there is slight nonlinearity with negative curvatures that can be ascribed to skew scattering due to excess fe.@xcite    the sign of the hall resistivity is positive in the mixed state as well as in the normal state indicating hole type carriers .",
    "there is no sign reversal for @xmath21 in the mixed state , which is a typical behavior for hole- and electron - type cuprate superconductors below @xmath4.@xcite@xmath9@xcite because hall conductivity @xmath138 [ @xmath139 , when @xmath140 is usually insensitive to disorder by a general argument of the vortex dynamics , it is convenient to discuss the hall results using @xmath138.samoilov@xmath9@xcite there are two contributions to the @xmath141 in the mixed state : @xmath142where @xmath143 is the conductivity of normal quasiparticles that experience a lorentz force inside and around the vortex core .",
    "this term has the same sign as the normal state and is proportional to h. the second term @xmath144 is an anomalous contribution due to the motion of vortices parallel to the electrical current density @xmath12 .    from the theory based on the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation , @xmath145 and it could have a sign opposite to that of @xmath143.@xcite@xmath9@xcite furthermore , the @xmath144 is the dominant term at low field but at higher field @xmath143 are important and could dominate over @xmath144 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath144 has a different sign when compared to @xmath143 , it is possible to observe a sign reversal in the hall effect in the superconducting state,@xcite@xmath9@xcite as for example in ybco.@xcite on the other hand , it can be easily seen in fig .",
    "5(a ) that the hall conductivity decreases with increasing field and the field dependence of @xmath138 changes more rapidly than @xmath146 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath138 is not independent of disorder in the strong pinning regime.@xcite according to the theory proposed by fukuyama , ebisawa , and tsuzuki ( fet),@xcite the sign of @xmath144 is given by the sign of @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the sign of the carrier , @xmath149 is the density of states , @xmath150 is the chemical potential , and @xmath151 is the fermi energy . on the other hand , in the phenomenological theory based on ginsburg - landau equation and its gauge invariance,@xcite the sign of the @xmath152",

    "the signs of @xmath144 may be different from that of @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , contrary to cuprate superconductors , the difference of fermi surface may be one origin of absence of sign reversal in fe(te , s ) .",
    "on the other hand , cuprate superconductors are d - wave superconductors , whereas , for fe(te , s ) , the gap function is unknown , but is most likely s - wave",
    ". this difference could be another origin of different contribution of the vortex cores to the hall conductivity.@xcite     measured at various temperatures in dc magnetic fields up to 35 t .",

    "the values of @xmath24 are in the range of @xmath159 and increase slightly with temperature .",
    "a phenomenological model considering the effect of pinning on the hall resistivity proposed by vinokur et al.,@xcite gives the scaling index @xmath160 which , as well as hall conductivity , is independent on the degree of disorder .",
    "this is believed to be a general feature of any vortex state with disorder dominated dynamics . on the other hand , based on the normal core model proposed by bardeen and stephen,@xcite wang , dong , and ting ( wdt),@xcite@xmath9wang zd2 developed a theory for the hall effect that includes both pinning and thermal fluctuations .",
    "in the wdt theory the scaling behavior is explained by taking into account the backflow current of vortices due to pinning .",
    "thereby @xmath24 changes from 2 to 1.5 as the pinning strength increases.@xcite this has been observed in irradiated ybco samples , where @xmath24 was found to decrease from 1.5 compared to 2 after irradiation,@xcite and in hgba@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath161 thin films with columnar defects , where @xmath24 changes from 1.0 to 1.2 with increasing the field.@xcite therefore , small values of @xmath24 in s-09 ( inset of fig .",
    "4(b ) ) may be connected with the strong pinning strength due to the considerably large concentration of defects in fe@xmath7(te@xmath6s@xmath8)@xmath28.@xcite",
    "in summary , we investigated the resistive taff and flux flow hall effect of fe@xmath25(te@xmath162s@xmath27)@xmath28 single crystal in high and stable magnetic fields up to 35 t. taff behavior could be understood within the framework of modified arrhenius relation assuming that the prefactor @xmath47 is temperature - dependent while @xmath100 is temperature - independent , and @xmath57 , @xmath101 can be set as a free parameter for fitting not limited to 1 .",
    "there is a crossover from single - vortex pinning region to collective creep region for both field direction .",
    "furthermore , @xmath101 changes from 1 to 2 when magnetic field is rotated along ab plane to c axis but it is not sensitive to the magnitude of magnetic field below 35 t .",
