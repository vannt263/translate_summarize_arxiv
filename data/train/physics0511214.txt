    "science has progressed a lot , but leaves several unsolved riddles here and there . any convincing ` proposal ' even at the level of ` hypothesis ' , which solves some of the riddles ,",
    "should be welcomed .",
    "the authors propose such a hypothesis : ` zero - spin - photon generation in pair - production and its subsequent decay into neutrinos and antineutrinos ' .",
    "+   + the riddles considered here are about : + ( 1)mysterious neutrinos ( and antineutrinos ) and its bizarre properties ? + ( 2)is there a need of slight asymmetry of matter over antimatter ( to explain extremely low value of nucleon to photon ratio ) in early universe ?",
    "+ ( 3)possibility of existence of anti - matter world ? + ( 4)parity - violation ( and also about cp and cpt ) ? +   + these riddles could easily be explained with the ` zero- spin - photon hypothesis ' considerations discussed in this paper .",
    "the proposed ` zero - spin - photon ' is in fact attributed as a necessary out - come in pair - production process as - demanded - by the second - law - of - thermodynamics . moreover , since the zero - spin - photon ( boson with velocity c ) does not exist in nature , it must be unstable to decay into two smaller half - spin particles such as neutrino and antineutrino ( fermions with velocity c ) conserving the spin .",
    "the hypothesis about ` zero - spin - photon and its subsequent decay into half - spin neutrino and antineutrino ' , clearly explains the genesis and bizarreness of neutrinos and solves several riddles .",
    "the authors have indicated in an earlier paper @xcite the possibility of low - energy zero - spin - photon ( @xmath0 ) generation from high - energy @xmath1-ray - photon in pair production as @xmath2 .",
    "to explain the essence of the paper @xcite , the re - understanding of ` heat ' and ` work ' in view of second - law - of - thermodynamics is necessary , which is explained as follows in section @xmath3 .",
    "second law of thermodynamics implies that ` although work can be fully converted to heat , but heat can - not be fully converted to work ' . for conversion of heat ( radiation ) to work ( particle ) some heat must go as waste .",
    "efficiency of ` work to heat conversion ' could be = @xmath4 , but efficiency of ` heat to work conversion ' must be @xmath5 .",
    "it may also be noted / remembered that though heat is considered as a statistical ( bulk ) aspect , but thermodynamics is equally applicable even for single - photon interactions , as shown and discussed in the earlier paper @xcite . +   + in thermodynamic - process",
    "` heat ' and ` work ' are generally obvious , but there are some misconceptions too . the so - called ` heat of a hot- body ' , as per second law of thermodynamics , is in fact not ` heat ' but ` work ' as it is due to vibration / motion of atoms / molecules . in electronic process",
    "where usually ` energy'-transfer / transition / conversion take place , recognition of heat and work is even more difficult .",
    "what is energy ?",
    "is energy ` heat ' or ` work ' ?",
    "a little thermodynamics considerations @xcite , however , will reveal that all energies such as potential energy , kinetic energy , electrostatic energy , chemical energy , nuclear energy , mass energy @xmath6 etc .",
    "are in a way ` work ' , except the radiation energy @xmath7 which is the real ` heat ' .",
    "in fact ` heat ' is the energy carried by the mass - less particle such as photon radiation waves , whereas energy carried by massive particle is ` work ' . in other words ,",
    "boson ( photon ) carries the ` heat ' as radiation waves , whereas fermion ( electron or fermion - groups as atoms / molecules ) carries ` work ' as kinetic , potential energy and other energy of particle(s ) . with this understanding that the photon ( radiation @xmath7 ) is ` heat ' and that the particle mass ( energy @xmath8 ) is work ; the two ` mass and energy conversion ' process namely - ` annihilation ' and ` pair - production ' [ 2 - 4 ] of electron and positron are reexamined from thermodynamics point of view , as follows .",
    "a particle(say , electron @xmath9 ) and an antiparticle ( say , positron @xmath10 ) can annihilate each other giving two @xmath1-ray photons i.e. , @xmath11 the total mass energy @xmath12 mev plus kinetic energy of the particles fully converts @xmath13 to the energy of the photons .",
    "the full conversion of work ( mass energy ) to heat ( radiation ) is well permissible under second law of thermodynamics ; the exact - reverse , however , is not permissible as discussed in next section @xmath14 and this is the key point of this paper .      if a @xmath1-ray of radiation energy ( heat ) of @xmath15 mev ( exactly ) could have to produce the electron and positron pair @xmath16 ( work ) , then it would be @xmath13 conversion of heat to work against the second law of thermodynamics , thus impossible . to save ( satisfy ) the validity of the second law of thermodynamics , a higher energy ( @xmath17 mev ) photon is required and that some other object such as nucleus is involved in the pair - production process to carry - away part of initial photon - energy ( and momentum ) , thus only less than @xmath18 photon s energy ( heat ) is utilized in producing the ` electron positron ' pair @xmath16(work ) .",

    "interestingly , it is shown in the paper @xcite that newton s gravitational formula is derivable from coulomb s formula if applied between the constituents of atoms of two bodies and if special relativity considerations are taken into account .",
    "this gravity theory @xcite also suggests ( predicts ) that though elementary particles and antiparticles attract each other but atoms ( of matter - world ) and anti - atoms ( atoms of antimatter - world ) would repel each other .",

    "the test - matter - mass around this valley tends to fall into the valley , creating an apparent gravitational attraction . to the test - antimatter - mass , residing on the other side of the fabric ( horizon ) , the dimple ( valley ) would appear from the other side as a mole ( hill ) ; hence the test - antimatter - mass will fall away from the cliff , creating an apparent repulsion between matter and antimatter .",
    "+   +      in section @xmath48 it is explained how neutrinos ( and antineutrinos ) are born due to decay of the zero - spin - photon as @xmath89",
    ". also explained there , is the fact that why neutrinos are left handed ( @xmath90 ) and antineutrinos are right handed ( @xmath91 ) , both move in same direction with spin in different directions to conserve spin,@xmath92 . thus all neutrinos ( free and abundant in our matter world ) are left handed and all antineutrinos ( free and abundant there in antimatter world ) are right handed .",
    "this is full ( maximal ) parity violation ( in weak interaction ) as observed @xcite experimentally too .",

    "but from fitch - cronin experiment @xcite of kaon decay , a very small cp violation does seem to occur in matter world thus favoring small asymmetry as mentioned in section @xmath93 .",
    "but in the same section , it is also argued that similar violation ( in other way ) could occur in antimatter world too again favoring small asymmetry but in opposite way .",
    "thus in totality ( for both worlds considered together ) the symmetry seems to be restored / retained .",
    "+ for time - reversal symmetry ( t ) there are compelling reasons that time - reversal can not be a perfect symmetry , especially in view of thermodynamic - irreversibility ( or second law of thermodynamics ) creating thermodynamic arrow of time @xcite . thus t must be violated @xcite even though it may be very slight , even un - noticeable .",
    "the slight violation of cp in each world and slight violation of t together ; could yield tcp restoration in each world and in totality too .",
