    "<S> in particular , we uncover two new states : one contains only the _ azimuthally oscillating _ solution in the configuration of the twin - cell flow state , and another a _ rotating _ flow state . </S>",
    "<S> topologically , these flow states are a limit cycle and a quasiperiodic solution on a two - torus , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . emergence of new flow states in addition to observed ones with classical fluid , indicates that richer but potentially more controllable dynamics in ferrofluidic flows , as such flow states depend on the external magnetic field . * +    the flow between two concentric differentially rotating cylinders , the taylor - couette system ( tcs ) , has played a central role in understanding the various hydrodynamic stabilities  @xcite tcs has been a paradigm to investigate many fundamental nonlinear dynamical phenomena in fluid flows . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of the geometry of the system allows for well - controlled experimental studies . </S>",
    "<S> the vast literature in this area has been built on the tcs with a simple fluid . </S>",
    "<S> ( for convenience , in this paper we call tcs with a simple fluid the _ classical tcs_. ) recently there has been an increasing amount of interest in the flow dynamics of the tcs with a complex fluid  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a representative type of complex fluids is ferrofluids  @xcite , which are manufactured fluids consisting of dispersion of magnetized nanoparticles in a liquid carrier . </S>",
    "<S> a ferrofluid can be stabilized against agglomeration through the addition of a surfactant monolayer onto the particles . in the absence of any magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , the nanoparticles are randomly orientated so that the fluid has zero net magnetization . in this case , the nanoparticles alter little the viscosity and the density of the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the absence of any external field a ferrofluid behaves as a simple ( classical ) fluid . </S>",
    "<S> however , when a magnetic field of sufficient strength is applied , the hydrodynamical properties of the fluid , such as the viscosity , can be changed dramatically  @xcite and the dynamics can be drastically altered . </S>",
    "<S> studies indicated that , under a symmetry - breaking transverse magnetic field , all flow states in the tcs become intrinsically _ three - dimensional _  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as such , a magnetic field can have a significant influence on the hydrodynamical stability and the underlying symmetries of the flow states through , e.g. , certain induced azimuthal modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> aside this a change in the magnetic field strength can also induce turbulence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ferrofluidic flows have wide applications , ranging from gaining insights into the fundamentals of geophysical flows through laboratory experiments  @xcite to the development of microfluidic devices and computer hard drives . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a recent study demonstrated that ferrofluidic flows in the tcs can reverse their directions of rotation spontaneously  @xcite , which has implications to the phenomenon of geomagnetic reversal  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our study of the ferrofluidic flow states in the tcs with a small aspect ratio was motivated by the following considerations . </S>",
    "<S> previous numerical and experimental works demonstrated that the effects of end walls are _ not _ </S>",
    "<S> negligible  @xcite even in the large aspect ratio tcs . </S>",
    "<S> the walls can thus have a _ significant _ effect on the flow dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for the classical tcs or for tcs with a ferrofluid but without any magnetic field , for small aspect ratio ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) the flow dynamics is dominated by the competition between normal and anomalous flow states , leading to rich dynamical behaviors  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the term `` _ normal _ '' ( `` _ anomalous _ '' ) is referred to as a flow state with vortex cells that give an inward ( outward ) flow near each lid in the radial direction . for systems of a small height different flows patterns with one ( _ one - cell flow state _ ) or two ( _ two - cell flow state _ ) </S>",
    "<S> taylor vortex cells were detected  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a plausible mechanism for the emergence of the flow states is that the vortex cells , independent of the normal or anomalous nature of the flow , divide the flow in the axial direction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , flows with two identical cells , the so called `` twin - cell '' flows , were observed  @xcite , in which the two vortex cells divide the flow in the radial instead of the common axial direction . </S>",
    "<S> that is , both cells touch the top and the bottom lids . </S>",
    "<S> while most flow states are steady , an unsteady and axially oscillatory flow state was also experimentally detected  @xcite and numerically demonstrated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative type of unsteady flow states with more complex dynamics  @xcite was observed in the tcs with an extraordinarily small aspect ratio ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) , where the flow can change among two , three , and four cells in a radially separating configuration over one period . to summarize briefly , existing works on </S>",
    "<S> the classical tcs demonstrated that complex oscillatory flow patterns can arise when the aspect ratio of the system is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> an open issue is what types of dynamical behaviors can arise in the flow patterns in the ferrofluidic tcs , subject to a magnetic field .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we report the results from a systematic computational study of the ferrofluidic flow dynamics in the tcs with a small aspect ratio , i.e. , on the order of unity , which we choose as a bifurcation parameter ( the radius ratio of the cylinders [ inner cylinder radius / outer cylinder radius ] is fixed to @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> another bifurcation parameter is the reynolds number ( @xmath3 see * methods * ) of the outer cylinder . specifically , we set the rotation speed of the inner cylinder so as to fix its reynolds number at @xmath4 , and vary the rotation speed of the outer cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> both end walls confining the tcs are stationary . </S>",
    "<S> to distinguish from the dynamics of a simple fluid , we apply a symmetry breaking , transverse magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the main results can be stated as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all flow states exhibit a general feature : they contain a stimulated two - cell mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the aspect ratio is changed , various bifurcations between steady and unsteady flow states can occur , corresponding to the transitions between the two - cell and one - cell states . while unsteady , axially oscillating flow states similar to those in a simple fluid can occur , novel unsteady flow states that are not found in the classical tcs can arise . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we uncover two new states : one that contains only the _ azimuthally _ oscillating solution in the configuration of the twin - cell flow state , and another a rotating flow state , which correspond topologically to limit cycle and quasiperiodic solution on a two - torus , respectively . due to the sequence of bifurcations following a symmetry breaking bifurcation , </S>",
    "<S> the one - cell and twin - cell flow states are symmetrically related . </S>",
    "<S> we also uncover various regions of bistability with the coexistence of one- and two - cell flow states . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of the novel flow states in addition to those occurring typically in the classical tcs suggests that the ferrofluidic tcs can exhibit richer dynamics that are potentially more controllable due to their dependence on an additional experimentally adjustable parameter : the magnetic field strength . </S>",

    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we focus on the flow states in the small aspect - ratio tcs . a common feature shared by all flow states </S>",
    "<S> is that the axisymmetric fourier mode associated with the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath5 ( see * methods * ) is dominant so that the flow states correspond to _ toroidally closed _ solutions . </S>",
    "<S> note that ferrofluidic flows dominated by an azimuthally modulated @xmath5 mode differ from the classical wavy vortex flow solutions in the absence of any magnetic field  @xcite , which are time - periodic , _ rotating _ states that do _ not _ propagate axially . in the presence of a transverse magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> all the flow states are fundamentally three dimensional with a stimulated @xmath6 mode , leading to steady ( _ non - rotating _ ) wavy vortex flows  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rotating flows with a finite @xmath7 mode can also arise , so do unsteady ( oscillatory ) flow solutions . </S>",
    "<S> a key indicator differentiating various flow states is the number of vortex cells present in the annulus , i.e. , in the @xmath8 plane . to take into account all the differences </S>",
