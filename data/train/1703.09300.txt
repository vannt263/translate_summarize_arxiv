    "mass terms in the dark sector are usually inserted by hand or generated by a separate symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "however , it is an intriguing question whether @xmath11 breaking by the standard model ( sm ) higgs could also generate the dark matter masses without violating the standard model gauge symmetries , and yet be safe from constraints arising through couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "we will answer this question affirmatively .",

    "the standard chiral yukawa couplings of dark left - handed @xmath3 lepton - like doublets and right - handed @xmath3 singlets with the higgs doublet then break the gauge symmetry of the coupled sm+dark matter model to @xmath14 , because the higgs couplings align the local @xmath8 gauge transformations in the visible and dark sectors .",
    "the `` private '' dark sector gauge bosons do not couple to the higgs doublet and therefore remain massless , with their cosmological energy densities after decoupling in the dark sector decaying with the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) scale factor @xmath15 proportionally to @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dark lepton - like particles ( for simplicity denoted as dark leptons in the following ) acquire mass terms through their sm - like yukawa couplings to the higgs .",
    "the dark leptons therefore constitute the dark matter in the model , assuming that leptogenesis also had an analog in the dark sector .",
    "neutrality under the internal gauge interactions of the dark sector then implies that the dark matter will consist of dark atoms .",
    "the resulting dark matter model is therefore similar to the dark atom models , see @xcite and references there .",

    "it is therefore compelling to assume that the higgs field also generates the masses in the dark sector .",
    "however , the couplings of the higgs doublet @xmath13 are constrained by the gauge symmetries of the standard model and renormalizability . therefore , to have mass generating yukawa couplings @xmath17 to fermionic dark matter @xmath18 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , requires a mirroring of the electroweak gauge group @xmath19 through a dark gauge group @xmath2 with its own gauge bosons @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which we can think of as `` private gauge bosons '' of the dark sector .",

    "however , currently we can constrain the dark sector only through gravitational effects and direct and indirect search limits .",
    "we can not currently distinguish between a @xmath49 or @xmath50 preference in the dark sector , and at this stage a @xmath49 formulation is as good as a @xmath50 formulation .",
    "there are obviously infinitely many possible ramifications of this model by also including corresponding families of dark quarks with dark symmetry group @xmath51 and corresponding gauge bosons @xmath52 .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the higgs boson to the dark quark - like multiplets would obviously not align the @xmath51 with the standard model @xmath53 .",
    "in such a model it would be natural to expect the dark matter to consist of dark atoms formed from dark leptons and dark nucleons , with the atoms formed due to the @xmath2 interactions in the dark sector .    however , we will focus on the simplest model of private gauge bosons with one dark family of lepton - like particles and their private @xmath8 gauge bosons ( [ eq : hdm1],[eq : dpsil],[eq : dpsir],[eq : yir ] ) .",
    "this is practically equivalent to a dark multi - family model with one family being lighter than the other families , thus being the relevant family for dark matter . because we do not need to exclude the presence of heavier lepton - like or quark - like @xmath2 doublets",
    ", we also do not have to worry about anomaly cancellation within the lightest lepton - like dark family .",
    "however , we will later find that the requirement for dark matter in the single lepton - like dark family implies @xmath54 , such that anomaly cancellation is actually fulfilled already with the single dark doublet @xmath4 .    without dark nucleons from a dark quark sector , coulomb - type repulsion between the dark leptons could counteract the pull of gravity .",
    "generically this would seem to imply that the @xmath2 couplings @xmath43 and @xmath44 should only be of gravitational strength for not actually preventing dark halo formation .",
    "however , we can choose the @xmath2 charges of the dark leptons in a way which allows for the formation of @xmath2 neutral dark atoms as bound states of the dark leptons , thus alleviating the contraints on the magnitudes of @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
