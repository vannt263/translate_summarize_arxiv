    "relaxor ferroelectrics are technologically important because they exhibit enormous room - temperature piezoelectric coefficients and sizable dielectric constants with relatively little hysteresis .",
    "@xcite these materials are typically characterized by a dielectric permittivity that peaks broadly with temperature and displays a frequency - dependent amplitude and position spanning at least 14 decades in frequency .",
    "@xcite this behavior differs markedly from the sharp , frequency - independent dielectric response observed in conventional ferroelectrics such as pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the most studied relaxor ferroelectrics are the lead - based compounds having the general formula pb@xmath8o@xmath2 , for which the @xmath8-site is occupied by one of two or more heterovalent cations .",
    "two such relaxors are pb(mg@xmath4nb@xmath5)o@xmath2",
    "( pmn ) and pb(zn@xmath4nb@xmath5)o@xmath2 ( pzn ) , both of which share the pbtio@xmath2 cubic perovskite structure .",
    "@xcite understanding the origin of the unusual dielectric properties of these materials is a topic of considerable current interest . to help clarify the origin of the  relaxor transition \" in the lead - based compounds , and to guide the development of new materials with similar dielectric properties , it is instructive to compare the physical properties of pmn and pzn to lead - free systems that display a similar frequency - dependent dielectric response . to this end",
    "we present a neutron inelastic scattering study of the relaxor k@xmath0li@xmath1tao@xmath2 ( klt ) for @xmath3 ( klt(0.02 ) ) and compare our results with those from prior studies of pmn - based and pzn - based relaxors as well as the undoped ( non - relaxor ) parent compound ktao@xmath2 .",
    "neutron inelastic scattering methods have played a historically significant role in shaping our understanding of ferroelectric materials .",
    "studies of the lattice dynamics , and specifically of the soft , zone - center transverse optic ( to ) mode , have shown that a direct link can be made between the neutron inelastic scattering cross section and the bulk dielectric response .",
    "@xcite early neutron scattering studies of several lead - based relaxors ,  @xcite which were later corroborated with optical measurements ,  @xcite discovered a strongly - damped , soft , to phonon branch that was associated with the formation of local polar nanoregions ( pnr ) ( elastic diffuse scattering ) .",
    "the unusual damping of the soft to phonon branch , which was termed the  waterfall \" effect , was initially considered to be a signature of relaxor behavior .",
    "however subsequent studies found similarly damped to modes in heavily - doped 40%pb(mg@xmath4nb@xmath5)o@xmath2 - 60%pbtio@xmath2 ( pmn-60%pt )  @xcite and pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite neither of these materials is a relaxor , and both show a sharp , well - defined ferroelectric transition similar to that in pure pbtio@xmath2 . therefore the waterfall effect , though somewhat unusual for perovskites , can not be regarded as a dynamic signature of the relaxor phase .",
    "neither neutron nor x - ray scattering studies have found any evidence of a truly long - range ordered , structural phase transition in pmn , as would be manifested by the splitting of a nuclear bragg peak .",
    "there is , however , a striking lack of consensus regarding pzn .",
    "several groups have reported a structural transition in pzn from cubic to rhombohedral symmetry .",
    "@xcite but other groups , using high - energy x - ray scattering techniques , have presented compelling evidence that this transition is confined to the near - surface region or  skin \" of the crystal , and that the actual shape of the pzn unit cell within the interior of the crystal remains cubic at all temperatures .",
    "@xcite the conclusion of a skin effect in pzn remains controversial .",
    "@xcite however similar observations have also been reported in pure pmn ,  @xcite as well as various compositions of pmn and pzn doped with pbtio@xmath2 .",

    "@xcite in all cases , the skin effect is observed in systems that possess strong , quenched , random electric fields .    despite the anomalous soft mode behavior and",
    "the controversial structural properties , neutron and x - ray scattering experiments on pmn and pzn have revealed two unique features that do appear to be experimentally linked to the relaxor state .",
    "these features provide the motivation for our study of klt(0.02 ) .",
    "first , both pmn and pzn exhibit strong , temperature - dependent , elastic ( i.  e.  static ) diffuse scattering that is polar in nature and highly anisotropic .",
    "this has been demonstrated by x - ray scattering measurements in zero and non - zero applied electric field ,  @xcite neutron scattering studies ,  @xcite and studies of the low - energy transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonons .",
    "@xcite the diffuse scattering is not purely static at all temperatures and in fact displays a slow relaxational character on a ghz timescale that was identified using neutron spin - echo  @xcite and backscattering  @xcite techniques .",
    "@xcite in particular , the neutron spin - echo experiment by stock _",
    "et al_.  revealed a dynamic component to the diffuse scattering in pmn that they related to the peak response in the dielectric permittivity .",
    "@xcite a summary of how the diffuse scattering may be a general property common to all relaxors , and not just to the lead - based systems , is given in ref .  .",
    "the second unique feature of relaxors concerns the presence of so - called  columns \" of inelastic scattering , broadly distributed in energy , that are located at the @xmath10-point ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12-point ( @xmath13 ) zone boundaries .",
    "@xcite a similar zone - boundary soft mode was observed at the @xmath10-point with x - ray inelastic scattering methods in the disordered perovskite pzt .",
    "@xcite the goal of our study of klt(0.02 ) is to determine how universal these features are to the relaxor phase .",
    "neutron inelastic scattering spectra from klt(0.02 ) and ktao@xmath2 measured on the 1 t thermal neutron spectrometer located at the llb .",
    "an underdamped ta mode is shown in panels @xmath14 and @xmath15 for both samples .",
    "energy broadened relaxational dynamics are observed in klt ( panel @xmath16 ) where the intensity decreases monotonically with increasing energy transfer . by contrast , ktao@xmath2 displays no such dynamics ( panel @xmath17 ) at the same wave vector and temperature .",

    "no long - range ordered structural phase transition , characterized by new , sharp ( resolution - limited ) bragg peaks , has ever been observed . for these reasons ktao@xmath2 is classified as an incipient ferroelectric .",
    "it is known that replacing k@xmath7 with li@xmath7 on the perovskite @xmath19-site stabilizes a ferroelectric ground state in klt for sufficiently large @xmath20 .",
    "microscopically , the much smaller li@xmath7 ion shifts away from the high symmetry position along one of six [ 100 ] directions thereby creating a local electric dipole , which has been studied using nmr techniques .",
    "@xcite it has also been shown that li@xmath7 doping actually hardens the soft zone - center to mode , which suggests that the transition to the ferroelectric phase is order - disorder in character and not displacive .",
    "@xcite however , consensus on the precise value of @xmath21 is lacking . in 1981",
    "measured the raman scattering from various klt samples as a function of temperature and concluded that they were consistent with the presence of a tetragonal or orthorhombic ferroelectric phase for @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite in 1987 kleemann _",
    "performed optical birefringence , refractive index , and dielectric permittivity measurements on klt and proposed a crossover from a dipole - glass to ferroelectric phase at @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite at the same time dielectric measurements have shown that the peak in the dielectric permittivity of klt is broad in temperature and strongly dependent on frequency across a range of concentrations @xmath24 and thus similar to the dielectric response of pmn .",
    "@xcite by analogy with the lead - based systems , the elastic diffuse scattering in more heavily li@xmath7-doped klt samples has been interpreted as resulting from short - range ferroelectric correlations or polar nanoregions .",
    "@xcite these results are supported by earlier neutron studies of the ta phonons in klt(0.035 ) , which employed an external electric field to observe the splitting of the ta modes resulting from a cubic - to - tetragonal structural phase transition .  @xcite more recently a neutron scattering study by wakimoto _",
    "_ examined the lattice dynamics of a single crystal of klt with @xmath25 and , just as in ktao@xmath2 , found a zone - center to mode that softens continuously on cooling and no evidence of any long - range ordered structural distortion .",
    "@xcite wakimoto _",
    "et al . _ also observed elastic diffuse scattering that increased monotonically on cooling below 200k , but it was present only near some nuclear bragg peaks such as ( 210 ) and absent near others such as ( 100 ) and ( 200 ) , and the diffuse scattering contours were elongated along @xmath26 ; this situation differs markedly from that observed in pmn and pzn .",
    "it is quite likely that some of the discrepancies between the aforementioned studies may be the result of uncertainties and/or gradients in the nominal values of the li@xmath7 concentrations .",
    "while there have been extensive studies of klt for @xmath20 , there has been comparatively little effort for very low li@xmath7 concentrations for which a well - defined ferroelectric transition is absent . for @xmath27 the dielectric constant displays a frequency - dependent and broad peak consistent with a relaxor phase , but no evidence of any elastic diffuse scattering nor",
    "any anomaly of the soft to mode characteristic of this phase has been observed .",
    "@xcite neutron experiments on klt(0.02 ) have reported a strong enhancement of the nuclear bragg peak intensity below a critical temperature that roughly matches the temperature at which the peak in the dielectric response occurs .",
    "the bragg peak enhancement is possibly indicative of a release of extinction and is similar to the behavior observed in pzn .",
    "@xcite however no bragg peaks were observed to split or distort , suggesting that the unit cell shape remains cubic at all temperatures .",
    "the dielectric permittivity and crystal structure of klt(@xmath27 ) are very similar to those of pmn and pzn .",
    "it is therefore puzzling that no other scattering signature of the relaxor phase , like those observed in lead - based systems , are seen in klt(@xmath27 ) .",
    "this begs the question of whether or not the dynamic features observed in the lead - based systems are common to other relaxor systems not based on pbtio@xmath2 . in this paper , we report neutron inelastic scattering results that demonstrate the existence of a definitive dynamic signature of localized ( i.e. short - range ordered ) ferroelectric correlations in klt(0.02 ) .",
    "we observe strong , overdamped fluctuations that achieve maximum intensity at a temperature close to that at which the dielectric constant peaks and also where the nuclear bragg peaks display a large enhancement in intensity .",
    "these fluctuations occur on the thz timescale , which is much faster than those observed in the lead - based pmn and pzn , and are poorly correlated spatially .",

    "we use neutron scattering methods to study the structural dynamics of klt and to connect the physics to the dielectric response .",
    "neutrons are uniquely well - suited to probe condensed matter systems over a broad range of momentum ( length ) and energy ( time ) scales with good resolution in both ( typically @xmath31@xmath32 and @xmath33mev or @xmath34thz ) .",
    "this capability nicely complements dielectric measurements , which can only probe fluctuations near @xmath35 but are sensitive to dynamics on much slower time scales ranging from ghz to mhz . therefore in order to understand how the fluctuations observed with dielectric measurements are spatially correlated and how they influence harmonic phonons on the thz timescale , it is essential to use neutrons , which are able to probe fluctuations throughout the brillouin zone .",

    "third , the activation energy ( @xmath76 ) and the characteristic timescale ( @xmath80 ) are both an order of magnitude smaller than that measured in the dielectric response . based on these three results , we suggest that the scattering is associated with dilute , highly local droplets of dipoles , or ferroelectric regions , created by the introduction of li@xmath7 dopants , which enter randomly into the lattice .",
    "given the ferroelectric nature of the localized object , we would expect a response at the zone center , consistent with dielectric measurements .",
    "unfortunately the non - zero energy and momentum resolution of the neutron spectrometer make measurements at the zone center problematic due to contamination from nearby acoustic modes .",
    "however , by extrapolating the results obtained at non - zero wave vectors , we are able to infer that a response exists at the zone center that is consistent with the ferroelectric nature postulated here .",
    "the dynamics can not be directly related to the hopping of li@xmath7 cations given the large discrepancy between the activation energies derived here and from dielectric measurements .",
    "this is further confirmed by the fact that the integrated intensity of the relaxational  quasi static \" component ( fig .",
    "[ compare_phonon ] ) is comparable to that in the low - energy acoustic phonons , which makes it unlikely to originate from the local hopping of a 2% dopant .",
    "these local dipoles are highly dilute and spatially uncorrelated as is evident from the absence of any well - defined , long - range - ordered , ferroelectric structural transition .",
    "the comparison of the dielectric and neutron data performed on different timescales indicates a hierarchy of degrees of freedom in klt(0.02 ) with different energy scales .",
    "such a scenario has been discussed in relation to the dynamics of glasses .",
    "@xcite    the scattering is unlikely to originate from a strictly zone - boundary distortion ( such as tilting of the octahedra ) because the temperature dependence of the neutron scattering linewidth and susceptibility display anomalies at the same temperature as do the @xmath35 dielectric measurements ( ref .  ) and the bragg peaks presented in fig .",

    "the presence of a broad relaxational component to the scattering in klt(0.02 ) is corroborated by raman measurements , which probe dynamics near the zone center .",
    "et al_.  reported evidence of new excitations around @xmath104@xmath105mev that broaden considerably with temperature in klt(0.014 ) .",
    "@xcite our results show that these excitations are broad in momentum and thus consistent with local ( uncorrelated ) objects . for larger concentrations of li@xmath7 where a ferroelectric ground state is present ,",
    "the local dipoles become spatially correlated and result in a soft to mode that hardens at low temperatures and a subsequent splitting of the ta and to phonons .",
    "@xcite    it is interesting to compare our results on klt(0.02 ) with those obtained from the lead - based relaxor ferroelectrics represented by pbmg@xmath4nb@xmath5o@xmath2 ( pmn ) .",
    "pmn displays very strong and temperature - dependent diffuse scattering that is somewhat spatially correlated . while the diffuse scattering in pmn is also broadly distributed in momentum , it is also highly structured and has been described in detail in a number of x - ray and neutron studies .",
    "the scattering observed in klt(0.02 ) is comparatively uncorrelated in momentum and better described by local , uncorrelated objects .",

    "the activation energies derived from the temperature dependence for pmn and klt(0.02 ) are @xmath106k and @xmath107k , respectively .",
    "there are therefore two key differences between the quasielastic diffuse scattering present in pmn and klt(0.02 ) : ( 1 ) the scattering in klt(0.02 ) is spatially uncorrelated in comparison to the strongly momentum - dependent and anisotropic diffuse scattering observed in pmn , and ( 2 ) the relaxational dynamics in klt(0.02 ) are roughly two to three orders of magnitude faster than those in pmn .",

    "quasistatic \" component observed here in klt(0.02 ) near the elastic ( @xmath42 ) line contrasts strongly with the harmonic soft mode anomaly observed in klt at larger li@xmath7 concentrations .",

    "we suggest that the low - energy , local , polar domains that we have associated with these fluctuations freeze near @xmath108k , but that they do so in a random fashion given the lack of any strong momentum dependence .",
    "this likely creates a random local field that could then explain the history dependence and slow frequency dependence observed near the transition temperature .",

    "<S> we resolve this dichotomy by showing that the structural correlations associated with the transition in klt(0.02 ) are purely dynamic at all temperatures , having a timescale on the order of @xmath6thz . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations are overdamped , non - propagating , and spatially uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> identical measurements made on pure ktao@xmath2 show that they are absent ( within experimental error ) in the undoped parent material . </S>",
    "<S> they exhibit a temperature dependence that correlates well with the dielectric response , which suggests that they are associated with local ferroelectric regions induced by the li@xmath7 doping . </S>",
    "<S> the ferroelectric transition that is induced by the introduction of li@xmath7 cations is therefore characterized by quasistatic fluctuations , which represents a stark contrast to the soft harmonic - mode - driven transition observed in conventional perovskite ferroelectrics like pbtio@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic , glass - like , structural correlations in klt(0.02 ) are much faster than those measured in random - field - based lead - based relaxors , which exhibit a frequency scale of order of @xmath6ghz and are comparatively better correlated spatially . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the view that random fields give rise to the relaxor phenomena , and that the glass - like dynamics observed here characterize a nascent response . </S>"
