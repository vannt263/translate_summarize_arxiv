    "achieving a satisfactory understanding of the nature and structure of quantum correlations is of paramount importance in quantum information theory @xcite as well as in the study of complex quantum systems @xcite ; very recent speculations even hint at possible fundamental roles played by quantum entanglement in biological systems and processes with enhanced properties of quantum coherence @xcite . for bipartite quantum systems prepared in globally pure states ,",
    "there is universal consensus on the fact that quantum correlations identify with entanglement , and they can be signaled by either one of several features that distinguish them from the classical ones .",
    "for instance , their non - local character , or their operational significance in quantum informational primitives such as entanglement creation and distillation , or the performance they enable as resources for quantum communication protocols such as teleportation @xcite . entanglement in this case is simply measured by how much information one is missing on the state of the global system by accessing only one part of it , hence capturing the correlations between the two parties .",
    "mathematically , such an information is quantified by the _ entropy of entanglement _ ,",
    "i.e.  the von neumann entropy ( or any monotonically increasing function of it ) of the reduced density matrix of either of the two subsystems @xcite , although it is worth remarking that other inequivalent measures of pure - state bipartite entanglement can be introduced beyond the von neumann entropy , such as the infinite set of rnyi entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix ( entanglement spectrum ) @xcite and the bipartite geometric entanglement @xcite , that are particularly relevant in the investigation of ground - state properties of condensed matter systems and in the theory of quantum information with continuous variables @xcite .    for bipartite mixed states and for general multipartite states ( pure or mixed ) , several inequivalent entanglement monotones ( as well as a number of measures of more general types of quantum correlations beyond entanglement in mixed states @xcite ) have been proposed , each apt to capture a different signature of quantumness and/or possessing a different operational meaning , especially in relation to different informational tasks @xcite .",
    "whilst all entanglement monotones must vanish on separable states , there can be some that vanish also on some entangled states , if the latter fail to encode the particular resource character associated to a given entanglement measure .",
    "this is the case , for example , of bound entangled states , which have a nonzero entanglement cost but a vanishing distillable entanglement , as no entangled singlets can be extracted from them by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) in the asymptotic regime @xcite .",
    "fundamental requirements for any _ bona fide _ entanglement monotone are then monotonicity under locc ",
    "operations that can not increase bipartite entanglement on average  and invariance under local unitary ( lu ) operations @xcite .",
    "the latter is in fact a basic requirement for any measure of correlation in general , since the choice of the local basis in which the density matrix of a system is expressed can not of course affect the information encoded in shared correlations between two ( or more ) subsystems .",
    "this fact has motivated the search for the simplest lu - invariant `` normal forms '' of quantum states in discrete as well as continuous variable systems @xcite , so as to reduce as much as possible the number of state parameters needed for a complete evaluation of a particular entanglement monotone .",
    "invariance of entanglement under lus has however more far - reaching consequences , especially , and not entirely without surprise , in its quantification .",
    "given a generic state ( pure or mixed ) of a bipartite systems , li - bin fu investigated the consequences of applying a local cyclic operation on one of the subsystems @xcite .",
    "fu denoted by local cyclic operation any lu that leaves the corresponding reduced state invariant .",
    "consider a bipartite quantum system @xmath0 in a global pure state @xmath1 with reduced density matrices @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively for subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and denote by @xmath6 a lu acting on @xmath2 only .",
    "then , the lu @xmath6 is cyclic if @xmath7 = 0 $ ] .",
    "although being local , thus leaving the entanglement unchanged , such an operation changes the global state , yielding a nonlocal effect that can be detected only by measuring the two subsystems jointly . employing the fidelity induced by the hilbert - schmidt metric , fu identified such a nonlocal effect by the distance between the initial and the final state",
    "recently , fu s pioneering work has been greatly extended by gharibian , kampermann , and bruss @xcite .",
    "they focused on the _",
    "_ m__aximization of the fu distance for bipartite states in hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimension as a possible indicator of non - local properties , and derived and discussed closed formulae for the maximal fu distance in three relevant cases : ( pseudo)pure quantum states , werner states , and two - qubit states . in between , two of us ( s.m.g . and f.i . ) investigated independently the consequences of lus on global pure states of @xmath8 and @xmath9 bipartite systems @xcite .",
    "they attacked the problem from the opposite side , investigating the _ _",
    "m__inimization of the ( squared ) fu distance , and proved , somewhat surprisingly , that in these two particular cases the minimum ( squared ) fu distance is a full bipartite entanglement monotone , coinciding with the linear entropy of entanglement ( also known as tangle for qubit systems @xcite ) . a similar analysis was performed to define a geometric lu - based entanglement measure for gaussian states of continuous variable systems , where subsystem @xmath4 comprises a single bosonic mode @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will present a complete generalization of the analysis carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite to all pure states of bipartite quantum systems with hilbert space @xmath10 of arbitrary finite dimension .",
    "we will show that one can construct an entire family of bipartite entanglement monotones that capture quantum correlations as quantified by the action of minimally perturbing lus on global pure states .",
    "specifically , we prove that the ( squared ) hilbert - schmidt distance between a pure bipartite state @xmath11 and the pure state @xmath12 obtained from it by applying a lu operation @xmath6 on subsystem @xmath4 only , once suitably optimized ( minimized ) over all lus with fixed spectrum , defines a hierarchy of bipartite entanglement monotones . moreover , the cyclic condition @xmath7 = 0 $ ] , rather than being imposed _ a _ priori is derived as a consequence of the minimization ( optimization ) procedure .",
    "we denote any such pure - state bipartite entanglement monotone as `` _ mirror entanglement _ '' .",
    "this is pictorially reminiscent of someone mirroring herself / himself in a mirror ( which is curved , symbolizing the action of a lu ) : in absence of entanglement , the mirror image of the original pure state under a lu ( the mirror ) is a perfect reflection .",
    "viceversa , the more entanglement is contained in the state of the system , the more distorted is the image that is reflected by the mirror .    as just stated , no constraints on the employed lus need to be imposed _ _",
    "initio : all the mirror entanglement measures are proven to be locc - monotones for arbitrary pure states of bipartite systems in any dimension .",
    "however , we will show that by imposing , as originally done in ref .",
    "@xcite , specific requirements on @xmath6 , namely a fully nondegenerate spectrum , one restricts the class further to _ faithful _",
    "mirror entanglement monotones that vanish if and only if the state @xmath13 is a product state . upon further restricting the admissible lus by requiring that they be traceless and with equispaced , nondegenerate eigenvalues ( thus with a pattern resembling a star in the complex plane )",
    ", we will single out a special faithful mirror entanglement monotone , that we will name `` _ stellar mirror entanglement _ '' .",
    "we will prove that the stellar mirror entanglement enjoys the property of being a lower bound to the linear entropy in any dimension , reducing to the latter in the special cases @xmath14 and @xmath15 originally considered in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is an upper bound to a function proportional to the linear entropy , with the proportionality constant being a simple function of the dimension of the reduced hilbert space @xmath16 .",
    "we remark that , by construction , the class of mirror entanglement measures is experimentally accessible by means of interferometric schemes @xcite involving at least two copies of a given bipartite state , one of which needs to be rotated by suitable lus . in principle , each mirror entanglement monotone can be straightforwardly extended to mixed bipartite states via the conventional convex roof construction .",
    "solving the convex roof optimization problem is of course in general a formidable task .",
    "however , as the mirror and stellar entanglement measures are defined in terms of distances ( in partial analogy with the construction of the geometric measures of entanglement @xcite ) , in the conclusions we will briefly discuss how it might be possible to envisage alternative strategies to compute their mixed - state extension without resorting directly to the convex roof construction .",

    "the analysis reported in this section shows that the stellar entanglement @xmath143me , a prominent representative of the @xmath27me mirror entanglement monotones , provides in general an independent characterization of bipartite entanglement in pure states of arbitrary finite dimension and is endowed with an intrinsic geometric origin depending entirely upon the global non - local effects induced only by the action of suitably identified classes of lu operations .",
    "in the present work we have introduce a geometric framework to derive bipartite entanglement monotones , including faithful ones , that apply to all pure states in hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the measures of mirror entanglement and the faithful mirror stellar entanglement that we have introduced are defined in terms of the minimal ( squared ) distance from a pure state to the pure state obtained from it by the action of suitably optimized lus acting only on one part of the bipartite quantum system under consideration .",
    "we identified a hierarchy of these lu - based entanglement monotones , studied their properties , and determined conditions for their faithfulness . among the faithful mirror entanglement measures , we focused on a special instance , the stellar mirror entanglement , characterized by additional symmetries in the spectrum of the associated lus .",
    "we proved that the stellar mirror entanglement obeys upper and lower bounds as a function of the linear entropy of entanglement in any dimension , reducing to the latter for local dimension @xmath166 .",
    "our results generalize an earlier study limited to pure states with reduced density matrices of lower local dimension @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "our work goes along a complementary direction compared to other studies that have investigated the nature of non - local effects when the distance from a state and its image under the action of lus is maximized rather than minimized @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable and somewhat surprising that looking at such a simple structure of lus from opposite ends can provide so much insight both on the structure of pure state bipartite entanglement and , at the same time , on the patterns of non - local effects generated from the application of lu operations .",
    "this interplay , yielding a host of complementary results , might hide yet undiscovered features common to the two approaches .",
    "both rely on the natural physical intuition of the operational approach to the study of physical systems : looking at the response to a given action as basic diagnostic tool of physical properties .",
    "it might then be worth to try to compare the two different situations in terms of a classification / ordering of least - disturbing and/or maximally disturbing lus .",
    "an interesting and important subject for future research is the generalization of the entanglement structure generated by lus to include mixed states .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that the problem of computing the convex roof of a prototype distance measure of entanglement such as the global geometric entanglement @xcite can in fact be recast in terms of determining the maximal fidelity to a separable state .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that this important result might perhaps be adapted and generalized to other classes of distance measures of entanglement , such as the mirror entanglement and the stellar entanglement introduced in the present work , or the mixed bipartite - multipartite geometric measures of entanglement defined as the hierarchy of distances from the sets of @xmath213-separable states @xcite .",
    "extensions of the present investigation to the qualification and quantification of multipartite entanglement and the characterization of monogamy constraints on its distribution appear to be challenging , even when restricted to pure states . here",
    "the problem appears of course to be that of understanding the nature of generalized `` local operations '' in the multipartite setting , and their ordering according to the associated local dimension .",
    "viceversa , a more readily exploitable application of our results is concerned with the factorization of quantum ground states in cooperative qu@xmath59it systems , a phenomenon that is currently receiving significant attention from both quantum information and condensed matter communities @xcite .",
    "indeed , the variety of quantum states belonging to one and the same lu - equivalence class may anyway have rather distinct features that become relevant especially in the context of many - body physics .",
    "for instance , if we consider a spin chain in a perfectly ferromagnetic state @xmath214 , flipping every other spin amounts to a lu operation that has no effect on the entanglement , yet results in a totally different ordered phase with a vanishing magnetization .",
    "the specific form of the ground state of a many - body hamiltonian , then , is important as well as its entanglement content and distribution in the form of bipartite or multipartite quantum correlations @xcite . in this context , the formalism of lu - based geometric entanglement for states with reduced density matrices of lower local dimension @xmath166 has already been applied to define energy witnesses as efficient diagnostic tools of factorization , relating it to the vanishing of faithful entanglement measures such as the stellar mirror entanglement . however , this lu - based theory of ground - state factorization had to be restricted so far to spin-1/2 systems @xcite and to be limited to investigate only total factorization into products of single - spin states @xcite , as the extension to higher spin systems and partial factorizations ( such as dimerization ) required considering higher local dimensions @xmath59 .",
    "the results of the present work allow in principle to extend the lu - based methods , originally developed for spin-1/2 models and total factorization , to the study of total as well as partial factorization points in models of higher - dimensional spins and in spin-1/2 models with frustration . in the latter case of frustrated spin-1/2 systems ,",
    "the lu - based entanglement formalism has been recently exploited to relate the existence of fully separable ground states ( totally factorized in the tensor product of single - spin states ) to the absence of frustration @xcite .",
    "equipped with the general proof of equivalence between pure - state factorization and invariance under lu spin operations with stellar ( or , generally non - degenerate ) spectrum , one may now investigate the possible existence of dimerized quantum phases ( i.e.  ground states composed of factorized singlets : tensor products of @xmath178 units , each of which is internally entangled ) by looking for candidate ground states invariant under stellar lus in @xmath178 .",
    "for spin-1/2 chains in the thermodynamics limit or in @xmath215 lattices one may expect that a hierarchy of compatible types of ground state correlations may take place , ranging from full factorization into products of single - spin states , to dimerization , up to genuine multipartite - entangled phases , as the degree of frustration increases as a function of a given tunable external magnetic field .",
    "the exploration of these intriguing scenarios , as enabled by the general analysis developed in the present work , will be the subject of further future studies .",
    "in order to prove the theorem , we will use dirac bracket notation throughout .",
    "it is convenient to establish some definitions and facts .",
    "let us denote the maximally mixed vector by @xmath217 . with this , @xmath218",
