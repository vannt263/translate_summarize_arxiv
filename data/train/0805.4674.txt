    "strongly correlated coulomb plasmas , found e.g. in planetary interiors @xcite , fusion plasmas @xcite , and plasmas excited by lasers or ion beams @xcite , are characterized by a high degree of spatial and temporal correlations , which lead to the emergence of phenomena like collective plasma modes , dynamical screening of the interparticle interaction potential , and dissolution of bound states .",
    "in particular , laser excited plasmas cover a broad range of densities and plasma temperatures .",
    "values range from typical condensed matter conditions to hot , weakly coupled plasmas .",
    "theoretical approaches to the physical properties of such systems have to deal with a great complexity .",
    "a particular challenge is the formulation of a coherent theory , which is valid over a wide range of densities ( @xmath4 ) and temperatures ( @xmath5 ) , thereby allowing to describe matter in various states , e.g. a solid - state target , being transferred into a plasma by interaction with high - power lasers and its subsequent relaxation @xcite .",
    "many - particle perturbation theory @xcite presents a general approach to many - body systems like condensed matter @xcite , partially and fully ionized plasmas @xcite , and nuclear matter , to mention only a few .",
    "also for non - abelian systems , such as the quark - gluon plasma @xcite , there exist similar approaches to the one described here for coulomb systems , e.g. the concept of schwinger - dyson equations , see the review article @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties as well as the response to external perturbations of these systems in various situations can be studied systematically @xcite .",
    "the central quantity within the many - body theoretical approach is the single - particle spectral function @xmath6 .",
    "it represents a physical observable which can be measured via angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite . starting from the spectral function",
    ", a number of interesting questions related to the physics of many - particle systems can be addressed .",

    "the focus is on the spectral function of plasmas . as an example ,",
    "a one - component electron plasma is considered which is charge compensated by a homogeneously distributed background of positively charged ions ( jellium model ) .",
    "the plasma is characterized by the degeneracy parameters @xmath7 and the plasma coupling parameter @xmath8 which are defined as @xmath9 here , the electron mass @xmath10 was introduced , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant . in this work , we consider only non - degenerate systems , @xmath12 , i.e. the thermal energy @xmath13 is large compared to the fermi energy @xmath14 .",
    "the calculation of the spectral function becomes challenging in the regime of strong coupling , i.e. when the plasma coupling parameter becomes comparable or larger than unity .",
    "the coupling parameter measures the ratio of the coulomb interaction energy of two particles at a mean distance to their thermal energy @xmath13 . at @xmath15 ,",
    "particle collisions become frequent , involving transfer of both momentum and energy .",
    "the interparticle potential is screened due to the presence of nearby third particles .",
    "these correlations significantly modify the plasma observables and have to be accounted for in the calculation of the spectral function .",
    "this is accomplished via the single - particle self - energy @xmath16 , which is a complex function of both wavevector @xmath17 and frequency @xmath18 , leading to a structured spectral function .",
    "though , the main task of many - particle theory , applied to strongly coupled systems , is to calculate the self - energy in a suitable approximation .",
    "the simplest approximation , often found in the literature on coulomb systems , is the mean - field or hartree - fock approximation @xcite .",
    "one obtains a frequency independent self - energy which induces a shift in the spectral function s pole , the so - called hartree - fock or quasi - particle shift . for dilute plasmas",
    ", this correctly describes the lowering of the chemical potential due to the averaged field of the plasma particles .",
    "also , the shift of the ionization energy for bound states is obtained @xcite . however , in dense systems , the mean - field approximation breaks down since the dynamical screening and collective excitations can not be accounted for .",
    "one has to go beyond the quasi - particle picture .",
    "a particularly successful approximation for the self - energy , including these dynamical effects , is the so - called @xmath19-approximation @xcite .",
    "correlations are accounted for via the dynamically screened interaction potential @xmath20 , rather than via the bare coulomb interaction .",

    "an analytic scaling law for the @xmath19 self - energy at low densities is derived which accurately describes the numerical data in this limit .",
    "this expression can be combined with corresponding formulae that are valid in the degenerate case , when @xmath23 , to construct a fit formula for the self - energy which then covers a large portion of the density - temperature plane .",
    "formerly , analytic expressions for the self - energy have been derived that base on the quasi - particle approximation @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the completely degenerate electron gas at @xmath24 was considered , using the plasmon - pole approximation @xcite , and also weakly coupled ( @xmath25 ) , classical plasmas ( @xmath26 ) , using the born approximation for the self - energy @xcite .",
    "the latter result exhibits several problems : the imaginary part of the quasi - particle self - energy is independent of density and carries a prefactor @xmath27 .",
    "thus , there is an unphysical finite damping of single - particle states even in the vacuum and the classical limit @xmath28 is not defined . on the other hand , from physical arguments",
    ", one expects that the self - energy vanishes at zero density and that it is a purely classical expression ( @xmath29 ) , when @xmath12 .",

    "the real part of the quasi - particle self - energy is well behaved , i.e. it vanishes at zero density and is purely classical .",
    "the new analytic expression for the self - energy presented in this paper is derived without the quasi - particle approximation , i.e. it is a non - perturbative result .",
    "it is shown that only this non - perturbative treatment leads to an expression that is classical for both the real and the imaginary part and vanishes exactly in the vacuum limit @xmath30 .",
    "the work is organized as follows : after a brief recapitulation of the single - particle spectral function and the @xmath19-method in section  [ sec : sf - se ] , numerical results for the self - consistent spectral function and self - energy will be discussed in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : analytic ] contains the derivation of the non - perturbative scaling law and comparison to the numerical results . in section",

    "central to the description of electronic properties in a many - body system , which is in thermodynamic equilibrium , is the thermodynamic electron single particle green function @xmath31 , defined at the discrete matsubara frequencies @xmath32 .",

    "also , the single - particle energy @xmath36 is introduced , @xmath37 is the electron chemical potential . @xmath38 contains the thermodynamic properties of a single particle coupled to a thermal bath at a given temperature @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the momentum distribution function is easily obtained by summation of the green function over all matsubara frequencies , @xmath39    instead of the complex matsubara green function , it is more convenient to operate on the real valued spectral function @xmath6 , defined on the real frequency axis",
    ". it carries the same information as the green function and is defined via the spectral representation of the latter , @xmath40 here , @xmath18 is a real valued frequency .",

    ", the sign of the imaginary part of the self - energy is fixed , i.e. @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the real part of the self - energy behaves unambiguous for @xmath46 .",
    "the spectral function usually exhibits several resonances , including a central peak , located at the quasi - particle energy @xmath47 , i.e. the solution of the quasi - particle dispersion @xmath48 accompanied by symmetrically distributed satellites which are attributed to collective modes in the many - particle system @xcite .",
    "the width of the resonances in the frequency domain is commonly identified with the inverse life - time of these excitations .",
    "let us first look at the lowest order approximation to the self - energy , the hartree - fock term @xmath49 .",
    "it is given by the convolution of a non - interacting green function with the unscreened coulomb potential @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is a normalization volume ) , @xmath52\\,v(q)\\equiv \\sigma^\\mathrm{hf}(\\mathbf{p})~ ,    \\label{eqn : sigmahf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the fermi distribution function @xmath53^{-1}$ ] .",
    "in the first line , summation takes place over the bosonic matsubara frequencies @xmath54 .",
    "the first term @xmath55 ( hartree term ) diverges , but it is exactly compensated by the same term from the positive charge background .",
    "the second term ( fock term or exchange term ) gives a finite contribution .",
    "closed expressions can be given in the case of non - degenerate plasmas @xcite and completely degenerate fermi gases @xcite .",
    "one finds @xmath56 in the high temperature limit ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 in the quantum degenerate case @xmath23 , see @xcite for details .",
    "thus , the hartree - fock self - energy fulfills the physical constraint to vanish at zero density .",
    "the hartree - fock term is a real function of momentum , only .",
    "the corresponding spectral function is shifted from the free particle dispersion , @xmath59 no imaginary part of the self - energy appears in this approximation , i.e. the life - time of the hartree - fock quasi - particles is infinite .",
    "this is consequence of the mean - field approximation , where no fluctuations of the electric field , i.e. no dynamics of the surrounding plasma particles are taken into account .",
    "recently , also the second order exchange contribution to the self - energy has been obtained in closed form @xcite , see also @xcite . however ,",
    "this term and all higher order terms , involving only the bare coulomb potential , do not lead to a finite particle life - time , only a shift of the dispersion relation is obtained .",
    "to describe the situation in a dense and strongly correlated system , where the single particle states are spectrally broadened , i.e. they acquire a finite life - time , one has to go beyond the quasi - particle approximation , and take into account the screening of the interaction .",
    "the @xmath19-approximation , can be regarded as the generalization of the hartree - fock theory to dynamically screened interactions .",
    "it was introduced by hedin @xcite for the homogeneous electron gas , and is defined as @xmath60 @xmath61 is the dynamically screened interaction . note that the @xmath19 approximation is a self - consistent ansatz , since the self - energy appears on the l.h.s . as well as in the green function on the r.h.s . of ( [ eqn : sigmagw0_matsubara ] ) . also , the screened interaction @xmath62 is a functional of the green function via the dielectric function @xmath63 , i.e. the polarization function @xmath64 : @xmath65 in @xmath19-approximation , @xmath64 is given by the inner product of two green functions , @xmath66 .",
    "the `` double '' self - consistency implied in this ansatz makes the @xmath19-approximation is complicated and a numerically demanding problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the full @xmath19-approximation suffers from deficiencies due to the neglect of vertex - corrections @xcite , such as violation of the @xmath67-sum rule @xcite .",
    "this problem can be avoided by keeping the dynamically screened interaction on the level of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , defined by the rpa polarization function , @xmath68 the use of the rpa polarization function leads to the so - called @xmath0 approximation for the self - energy .",
    "it has been shown to give more accurate quasi - particle energies @xcite than the full @xmath19-approximation . additionally , it is known that higher order corrections beyond @xmath0 , such as vertex - corrections and corrections in the polarization function beyond rpa , partially compensate . therefore , ignoring them altogether is expected to give better results than accounting for one or the other @xcite . the @xmath67-sum rule is fulfilled .",
    "further sum rules , e.g. for the moments of the spectral function can be derived @xcite which are useful to control the numerical treatment of the integral equations to solve .",
    "the inverse dielectric function @xmath69 describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the plasma . as a main feature",
    ", it contains the longitudinal plasma oscillations or plasmons .",
    "these resonances show up as peaks in the inverse dielectric function , located at the roots of the plasmon dispersion @xmath70 . for non - degenerate systems , as considered here , the plasmon dispersion can be expanded in powers of the wavenumber @xmath71 , and one finds the gross - bohm relation @xcite @xmath72 for the plasmon resonance frequency @xmath73 . here",

    "a detailed discussion of the plasmon resonance in dense plasmas can be found in @xcite . for the present discussion",
    ", it is important to keep in mind that the collective plasma excitations are accounted for via the inverse dielectric function in rpa .",
    "this is the main advantage of the @xmath0-approximation compared to the mean - field or hartree - fock approximation .",
    "depending on the choice of parameters like density and temperature , these plasmon resonances determine the shape of the self - energy as a function of the frequency and thereby also the spectral function , where satellites besides the quasi - particle peak indicate coupled electron - plasmon modes , often referred to as plasmarons @xcite .",
    "it should be noted at this point that contributions from bound states to the self - energy are not accounted for in this work .",

    "these are independent of the concrete approximation used for the self - energy . in second order",
    ", one obtains an equation relating the first moment of the spectral function to the interacting hartree - fock self - energy ( [ eqn : sigmahf ] ) , @xmath87 similarly , the second moment is related to the hartree - fock energy and the frequency integrated imaginary part of the self - energy , which is itself a conserved quantity , at least within the @xmath0 approximation , see ( [ eqn : norm_imsigma ] ) below , @xmath88 for the @xmath0 self - energy , holm and von - barth have found the following identity , relating the integrals over the imaginary part of the self - energy to the totally integrated response function , @xmath89    in the next section , results for the self - energy will be presented that are obtained via numerical solution of ( [ eqn : sigmacorr_010 ] ) .",

    "as discussed , the spectral function in the low density limit is lacking any plasmaron resonances , only a broadened quasi - particle peak appears , see figure [ fig : a_comparison_densities ] . in order to understand this behaviour ,",
