    "satellites embedded within planetary rings open gaps @xcite .",
    "ring particles passing by a satellite are gravitationally repelled so that the satellite is surrounded by an underdensity of ring material . in saturn s rings , satellites larger than a few km open gaps extending a full @xmath1 radians in azimuth ( e.g. , pan in the encke gap ; @xcite ) . for smaller moonlets , physical collisions and gravitational interactions between ring particles diffuse particles back into the gap downstream of the moonlet .",
    "thus partial gaps are produced whose azimuthal extents depend on ring viscosity and moonlet mass @xcite .",
    "the _ cassini _ spacecraft has imaged such partial gaps ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter t10 ) .",
    "because of keplerian shear , density perturbations excited at a moonlet s position drift toward greater longitudes inside the moonlet s orbit and toward lesser longitudes outside , forming a pair of features dubbed a `` propeller '' for its s - like shape . according to numerical simulations , a propeller s radial width ( the radial offset between the azimuthally extended propeller `` blades '' ) is @xmath2 hill radii of the moonlet @xcite . combining this result with measurements of propellers radial widths from _ cassini _",
    "images , t10 infer moonlet radii of @xmath00.11  km .    the appearance of a given propeller varies significantly from image to image , depending on the illumination and viewing geometries , the 3d structure of the density perturbations , and the optical properties of ring particles .",
    "these effects have not yet been disentangled .",
    "still , it seems clear that at least for some propellers , the gaps azimuthal ( longitudinal ) lengths are much larger than their radial widths .",
    "panel ( e ) of figure  1 of t10 shows an s - shaped bright lobe of radial width @xmath3 km and azimuthal length @xmath0100  km  this is the propeller blriot , the largest and most extensively imaged ",
    "embedded within a still longer dark gap whose azimuthal half - length ( half the distance between gap ends ) is @xmath4 hill radii .    intriguingly , blriot displays non - keplerian motion ( t10 ) . over several years",
    ", blriot s orbital longitude deviated from a strictly keplerian solution , showing residuals that varied nearly sinusoidally in time with a period of @xmath03.7 yr and an amplitude ( half the distance from peak to trough ) of @xmath00.1 deg or @xmath0200 km , an amount less than but of order @xmath5 .",
    "data for other propellers are much more limited than for blriot but suggest similar behavior ( t10 ) .",
    "the longitude variations imply semimajor axis variations of the underlying moonlet . @xcite and @xcite investigated semimajor axis variations due to stochastic torques exerted by self - gravitating wakes of ring particles @xcite . over timescales of years , stochastic torques might give rise to observable drifts in longitude , as shown in figure 6 of @xcite .",
    "but the observed 3.7-year period of the longitude variations does not arise naturally from stochastic torques , which are driven by wakes that have lifetimes of order one orbit period @xmath6 14  hours .",
    "alternatively , blriot s moonlet may librate within a resonance established by another larger moon ( t10 ) .",
    "however , no such resonant partner has been identified .",
    "furthermore , many other propellers show longitude deviations of similar magnitude to blriot s , and invoking a separate partner moon for every propeller seems unnatural .    here",
    "we propose that blriot and propellers like it are indeed participating in resonances .",
    "but the resonances are with nearby ring material , not with other moons . each propeller s moonlet librates within the potential established by co - orbiting ring particles at the ends of the long gaps , at distances @xmath5 away",
    ". this new type of co - orbital resonance , reminiscent of that between the saturnian satellites janus and epimetheus @xcite , shares properties with both tadpole and horseshoe orbits in the restricted three - body problem ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we begin with a toy model of the co - orbital material ( figure  [ fig : schematic]a ) : two identical point masses ( `` secondaries '' ) each of mass @xmath7 orbiting a central body ( `` primary '' ) of mass 1 .",
    "the secondaries reside on circular , co - planar , keplerian orbits of radius 1 and angular frequency 1 .",
    "the azimuthal separation of the secondaries is @xmath8 .",
    "the secondaries are meant to represent ring material at the ends of the gap opened by a propeller - moonlet .",
    "b ) using @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "fast epicyclic motion of different amplitudes is visible on top of the azimuthally elongated `` frog '' orbit of the guiding center .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ]    the secondaries establish an equilibrium point between them at azimuth @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 ( in cylindrical coordinates in the frame co - rotating with the secondaries ) .",
    "just as for the triangular lagrange points , this equilibrium point is dynamically stable because of the coriolis force . and as with conventional tadpole and horseshoe orbits , test particle motions about our equilibrium point decompose into a fast epicycle of period @xmath1 and a slow libration of the guiding center ( semimajor axis ) .",
    "we propose that the slow libration is the non - keplerian motion reported by t10 .",
    "we now derive the libration period and the shape of the guiding center orbit in the limit of small libration amplitude . in",
    "the frame rotating with angular frequency 1 , the equations of motion for the ( assumed massless ) moonlet read @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the celestial mechanician s potential , @xmath15 and the distances between the moonlet and the secondaries are @xmath16 note that we are ignoring the displacement of the center - of - mass from the primary .",
    "as shown below , the associated indirect term of the potential , though crucial for the stability of conventional tadpoles , is not essential for our problem .",
    "moreover , in the more realistic situation where the mass in the secondaries is spread smoothly over the co - orbital region  i.e .",
    ", over nearly the full @xmath1 rad in azimuth , excepting the gap of width @xmath17the barycentric displacement is much smaller than in the present two - point - mass problem .",
    "we will consider this more realistic case at the end of this section .",
    "we expand @xmath14 in the limit of small displacements from the equilibrium point , @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath20 we insert ( [ eqn : approxu ] ) into ( [ eqn : r])([eqn : theta ] ) , taking @xmath21 and keeping only leading - order terms to filter out the fast epicyclic motion .",
    "we also assume that @xmath22 , i.e. , we assume that the gap length is much larger than the hill sphere of the secondary ( not to be confused with the hill sphere of the moonlet ) . the fixed point is then @xmath23 and the equations of motion about it are @xmath24 equation ( [ eqn : leadr ] ) states that the test particle moves according to the kepler shear . taking the time derivative of ( [ eqn : leadr ] ) and inserting the result into ( [ eqn : leadtheta ] ) , we have @xmath25 which yields harmonic motion of period @xmath26 in units where @xmath1 is the local orbital period .",
    "since @xmath27 is largest when @xmath28 is largest , the aspect ratio of the guiding center orbit is @xmath29 numerical integrations of the two point - mass case agree well with equations ( [ eqn : period ] ) ( figure  [ fig : smooth]a ) and ( [ eqn : aspect ] ) ( data not shown ) .    a few comments :    1 .   as with conventional horseshoe orbits but not conventional tadpoles , stable librations here",
    "do not require the indirect potential .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : smooth]a , the libration period decreases with increasing libration amplitude ; again , this behavior resembles that of horseshoes but not of tadpoles .",
    "3 .   without the coriolis force term @xmath30 in equation ( [ eqn : leadtheta ] )",
    ", stable librations would not occur .",
    "thus the coriolis force acts as a restoring force , just as it does for tadpoles .",
    "4 .   like the triangular lagrange points",
    ", our fixed point corresponds to a local minimum of @xmath14 and a local maximum of the physical potential @xmath31 .",
    "if the energy of a particle in resonance is dissipated slowly compared to the libration period , the libration amplitude should grow with time , just as for conventional tadpoles .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm this .",
    "5 .   given @xmath22 ,",
    "the guiding center orbit is thinner in @xmath32 than in @xmath33 .",
    "conventional tadpole orbits are even thinner : @xmath34 .    given these commonalities with tadpoles and horseshoes , we refer to our guiding center orbits as `` frog orbits . ''    we now address the more realistic situation where the secondary masses are spread uniformly in azimuth to fill the region @xmath35 to @xmath36 ( passing through @xmath37 ) .",
    "in this case we might expect only the mass within an angle @xmath0@xmath38 of either end of the gap to influence the moonlet .",
    "in other words , the effective mass of the co - orbital region may be contained at azimuths @xmath39 between @xmath38 and @xmath0@xmath17 .",
    "if so , then the scalings in equations ( [ eqn : period ] ) and ( [ eqn : aspect ] ) still apply with @xmath40 replaced by the effective mass @xmath0@xmath41 , where now @xmath40 is the mass of the entire ring co - orbiting with the moonlet .",
    "our numerical simulations ( figures  [ fig : schematic]b ,  [ fig : smooth]b ) confirm the resulting scalings of period and aspect ratio with @xmath40 and @xmath38 and yield coefficients such that @xmath42 in the limit of small libration amplitude . for parameters inspired by blriot and its environment",
    " i.e . , for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the disk surface density @xcite and @xmath46our numerical integrations yield @xmath47 4 yr .",
    "this is encouragingly close to the @xmath03.7 yr period measured by t10 .",
    "note that these parameters satisfy the assumptions @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 that we made to derive equations  ( [ eqn : period])([eqn : aspect_smooth ] ) . also , assuming a moonlet density of @xmath01  g / cc and the median moonlet radius @xmath00.75  km inferred by t10 , the moonlet - to - saturn mass ratio @xmath51 is @xmath0@xmath52 as required by our assumption that the moonlet mass is negligible .",
    "in this work we identified a new kind of orbital resonance between a moonlet embedded within an underdense gap of angular extent @xmath53 and disk material co - orbiting with the moonlet beyond the ends of the gap .",
    "we found formulae for the resonant libration period @xmath54 ( equation [ eqn : period_smooth ] ) and the radial / azimuthal aspect ratio of the guiding center orbit ( equation [ eqn : aspect_smooth ] ) in terms of @xmath38 and the co - orbital disk mass @xmath40 .",
    "these librations resemble standard tadpole orbits because @xmath55 and because the coriolis force stabilizes the resonance .",
    "but whereas tadpoles also require the indirect potential for stability , the librations discussed here do not and are more like horseshoes in this respect .",
    "we propose that our new `` frog resonance '' explains the non - keplerian motion seen for saturnian propeller features such as blriot .",
    "the observed timescale over which blriot s orbital longitude residuals vary ( @xmath03.7 yr ) is well reproduced by our theory",
    ". measurements of non - keplerian motion and their interpretation as resonant frog librations thus offer new constraints on ring surface density ( through @xmath40 ) and gap geometry ( through @xmath38 ) independent of radiative transfer models of scattered light images .",
    "our simple resonance model does not include interactions with other satellites , nor does it account for disk torques responsible for type i or type ii migration ( for migration in the context of gas disks , see @xcite ; analogous effects for particle disks like saturn s rings are discussed by , e.g. , @xcite ) . since no propellers are seen at the locations of strong mean - motion resonances with the major saturnian moons , and",
    "since blriot at least has no obvious mean - motion resonant partner , we believe it reasonable to neglect such resonances .",
    "secular interactions do not alter the semimajor axis of a propeller - moonlet ; moreover , the eccentricities involved are too small for secular precession to be relevant .    type i migration is driven by imbalanced lindblad torques from the disks exterior and interior to the moonlet s orbit .",
    "the torque from each side is dominated by material at the edge of the gap , located at a radial distance @xmath56 away from the moonlet .",
    "if we assume that the torque from the outer disk exceeds that from the inner disk by of order @xmath57 , where @xmath32 is the moonlet s orbital radius , then the type i migration rate is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 ; @xmath60 is the unperturbed local surface density ; @xmath61 is the mass ratio of the moonlet to saturn ; and @xmath62 is the keplerian orbital velocity of the moonlet .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : typei ] ) follows from the standard impulse approximation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because the gap radial width @xmath63 for propellers , the scalings in equation  ( [ eqn : typei ] ) are equivalent to those of equation ( 39 ) of @xcite : @xmath64 .",
    "our numerical estimate for @xmath65 in equation ( [ eqn : typei ] ) is made for parameters appropriate to blriot and is much too small to contribute significantly to that propeller s longitude residuals , as those residuals imply an rms radial speed of @xmath0100 m / yr",
    ". moreover the type i drift is of one sign , whereas the radial drift of blriot implied by the observations switches sign .",
    "however , since @xmath66 , the near cancellation of lindblad torques assumed above is delicate and may be overwhelmed by radial surface density gradients .",
    "any long - term trend in the longitude residuals , over and above the sinusoidal frog oscillations which we have analyzed , may therefore help constrain the radial density profile .",
    "for example , figure 4a of @xcite shows an apparent monotonic drift in blriot s longitude residuals of about @xmath67 in 3.7 years . if this drift is real and if it grows quadratically with time  and these are highly uncertain prospects , as any characterization of a long - term trend depends on the method used to derive blriot s mean motion ( m.  tiscareno , personal communication)then such a drift would correspond to an inward migration speed of @xmath03 m / yr . the disk just outside blriot s orbit would have a greater surface density than that inside by of order 1 part in 100",
    "alternatively , a long - term nonlinear trend in the longitude could arise from the stochastic torques studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have interpreted the non - keplerian motions of propeller - moonlets as backreactions of their perturbed disks on the moonlets .",
    "our model , however , is not self - consistent because we have not considered how the motions of the moonlet feed back into shaping the gap .",
    "we have only computed the motion of a moonlet , idealized as a test particle , embedded in a gap whose structure is presumed stationary in the co - rotating frame .",
    "we do not have a theory that predicts the libration amplitude relative to the gap ends .",
    "energy dissipation ( for example , by interparticle collisions ) tends to increase the libration amplitude , but we do not understand how the amplitude might be damped .",
    "observationally , whether the gap itself shows non - keplerian motion , or equivalently whether the moonlet moves relative to the gap ends , is difficult to determine ( m.  tiscareno , personal communication ) .",
    "the appearance of a gap varies from image to image in ways not yet completely understood , and even measurements of basic quantities such as a gap s angular size @xmath38 are complicated by azimuthal structure inside the gap ( i.e. , gap ends are not simple step functions ) .",
    "improvements in radiative transfer modeling of images ; more astrometric measurements of propellers and their relative positions inside their gaps ; and a self - consistent theoretical treatment of how moonlets force disks and disks force moonlets may yield further insights .",
    "we thank matt tiscareno for sharing his discovery in advance of publication that propellers exhibit non - keplerian motion , and for subsequent discussions .",
