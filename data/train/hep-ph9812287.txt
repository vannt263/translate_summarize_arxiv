    "the study of qcd at finite density has a long history .",
    "the suggestion that at high densities hadronic matter becomes quark matter @xcite was made almost immediately after the discovery of asymptotic freedom @xcite .",
    "it has been known for almost as long that at very high baryon densities , where perturbative qcd can be applied , quark matter is in a bcs - type superconducting state @xcite .",
    "more recently , various groups @xcite have modeled quark matter at intermediate densities using phenomenological four - fermion interactions and found that condensates form with sizable gaps of order 100 mev .",
    "these studies reveal a rich phenomenology @xcite , including an interesting phase diagram @xcite , new symmetry breaking schemes like color - flavor locking @xcite , which might be also relevant for the study of nuclear matter in the nuclear superfluid phase , if the latter is continuously connected to the quark matter phase @xcite .",
    "naturally , a systematic calculation in perturbation theory is possible only in the high - density regime , where the chemical potential @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath4 and the strong coupling at the scale of the fermi energy is small .",
    "however , even in this case reliable calculations have so far been hampered by the inability to take into account the long - range nature of the color magnetic force , which dominates the interaction between the quarks at large distances .",
    "instead of tackling the problem of condensate formation by a long - range interaction , many treatments rely on the assumption that a magnetic mass of order @xmath5 is somehow generated",
    ". however , in reality , the magnetic field remains unscreened in the absence of superconductivity itself .",
    "ordinary bcs theory can not be directly applied due to the ir divergence from the exchange of the soft magnetic gluons . therefore ,",
    "even the asymptotic , weak - coupling behavior of the gap has not been found .    in this paper",
    "we present what we believe to be the correct estimate for the value of the bcs gap at asymptotically high densities .",
    "our approach is based on the renormalization group around the fermi surface @xcite , properly modified to take into account the long - range magnetic interaction .",
    "we find that the gap is proportional to @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "for some constant @xmath8 .",
    "] this behavior is different from the naive expectation from bcs theory , which predicts @xmath9 .",
    "the fact that the suppression is parametrically much milder means a larger value of the gap at high densities , and potentially could also indicate that at intermediate densities the gap and the critical temperature may be larger than previously estimated .",
    "the latter may substantially enhance the chance of forming a color superconductor in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we also show that the asymptotic behavior of the gap does not depend on the angular momentum of the cooper pairs , and comment on the possibility of breaking rotational symmetry by the formation of a condensate with a nonzero angular momentum .",
    "we will first review the renormalization group approach to the bcs theory ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] ) , then describe the trouble caused by the long - range magnetic interaction ( sec .  [",

    "an elegant method to see the formation of the bcs superconducting state is the renormalization group ( rg ) near the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "this approach has been applied to the case of quark matter by evans , hsu and schwetz , and schfer and wilczek @xcite .",
    "these treatments apply when there exists a nonzero magnetic mass , screening the color magnetic interaction . for completeness , we give here an elementary overview of the approach , in the spirit of non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",

    "@xcite and consider a theory of quarks interacting via a local four - fermion interaction .",
    "the aim is to give an overview of the conventional rg approach before tackling the more difficult problem of a long - range interaction . keeping in mind that one - gluon exchange conserves helicity",
    ", we will for simplicity consider only left - handed fermions .",
    "let us imagine a fermi gas of massless quarks with a chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "in the ideal gas approximation , all energy levels below the fermi surface @xmath10 are filled .",
    "the energy will be measured relative to the fermi surface , so we introduce @xmath11 .",
    "the rg procedure works as follows . at any given step ,",
    "the effective theory contains only the fermion degrees of freedom located in a thin shell surrounding the fermi surface .",
    "these fermions have @xmath12 .",
    "all others have been integrated out .",
    "the only relevant interaction between the fermions is the scattering of pairs with opposite momenta @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the scattering amplitude from a pair with momenta @xmath13 to another pair with momenta @xmath14 , @xmath15 to avoid complications with statistics , we will assume that the two particles are of different flavors .",
    "near the fermi surface , the amplitude depends only on the angle @xmath16 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a positive @xmath19 corresponds to a repulsive interaction , and a negative @xmath19 means attraction between particles with opposite momenta .    in the spirit of the wilson renormalization group ,",
    "let us now integrate out all fermion states with @xmath20 . according to quantum mechanics , the scattering through virtual states in this region gives a correction to the scattering amplitude . to account for these virtual processes , we need to correct the scattering amplitude .",
    "thus @xmath19 obtains a correction , @xmath21 where the sum is over all intermediate states @xmath22 belonging to the sector of the theory that has been integrated out .",
    "the virtual state @xmath22 may have a different energy @xmath23 than the initial energy @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the initial and final particles are almost exactly located at the fermi surface , so @xmath25 . what could be the states @xmath22 ? to answer this question",
    "one notices that the scattering through an intermediate state can be of two types :    \\1 .",
    "the pair @xmath13 can scatter to an intermediate pair @xmath26 , which then goes to @xmath14 . in this case , the intermediate state @xmath22 is that with two particle excitations with momenta @xmath27 .",
    "the pauli principle requires that @xmath28 is located above the fermi surface .",
    "this state has @xmath23 = @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "alternatively , first a pair of particles inside the fermi sea with momenta @xmath26 can scatter to make the final pair @xmath14 , and then the initial pair @xmath13 scatters to fill the holes vacated by the pair @xmath26 in the fermi sphere . in this case , the intermediate state @xmath22 consists of six elementary excitations : four particles with momenta @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and two holes with momenta @xmath27 located below the fermi surface , @xmath34 . in this case , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "it is clear now that eq .",

    "the integral over @xmath40 can be taken , and eq .",

    "( [ dftheta / dt ] ) describes the rg evolution of the scattering amplitude on the fermi surface .",
    "it is convenient to expand the scattering amplitude over partial waves , @xmath45 or , inversely , @xmath46 . using a well known property of the legendre polynomials , we find that the partial - wave amplitudes @xmath47 evolve independently , @xmath48 the solution to eq .",
    "( [ dfl / dt ] ) is @xmath49 we see that if at @xmath50 all @xmath51 , which means that the interaction is repulsive in all channels , then the four - fermion interaction vanishes at the fermi surface . however , if one of @xmath52 is negative , it will develop a singularity ( the landau pole ) at @xmath53 .",
    "the landau pole is reached first by the channel having the largest negative @xmath52 .",
    "this singularity is nothing but the manifestation of the bcs instability of the fermi surface with respect to any attractive interaction .",
    "the bcs gap is proportional to the energy scale at which the landau pole is reached , @xmath54    let us reproduce some results obtained in ref .",

    "the interaction is most attractive in the @xmath60-channel and a bcs state is formed with the gap @xmath70 the gap has the @xmath71 dependence on the coupling @xmath3 .",
    "this parametric dependence of the gap has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and is the same as that obtained in variational or mean field treatments of models with a four - fermion interaction between quarks @xcite .",
    "we will see that in the true theory , the dependence at asymptotically high densities ( @xmath72 ) is different from that obtained in these toy models .",
    "let us try to naively apply the method developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] to high - density qcd . at the lowest order ,",
    "the quarks interact by exchanging one gluon .",
    "the gluon propagator , which is @xmath73 in vacuum , is modified by screening effects .",
    "the static color electric field is subjected to debye screening at the distance scale @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , which can be seen by resumming bubble diagrams in the gluon propagator . in the magnetic sector",
    ", the same resummation yields a magnetic gluon propagator , @xmath76 in the regime @xmath77 .",
    "the term @xmath78 comes from the landau damping . in the static limit @xmath79 , the magnetic field",
    "is not screened .",
    "if @xmath80 , the field is said to be `` dynamically screened '' on the scale @xmath81 .    before going further ,",
    "let us make an important comment on a confusion in the literature .",
    "this confusion originates from the similarity between the high - density and high - temperature gauge theories .",
    "the similarity can be seen in the debye screening , which occurs at the scale @xmath82 at high temperatures and @xmath83 at high densities . at high temperatures ,",
    "the magnetic field is not screened at the one - loop level , but develops a non - perturbative screening of order @xmath84 .",
    "this sometimes leads to an unjustified assumption that the magnetic field develops a magnetic mass of order @xmath5 in high - density qcd .    to see why the analogy between high temperatures and high densities breaks down on the question of the magnetic screening ,",
    "let us review three standard ways to interpret the emergence of the magnetic mass in hot gauge theories .",
    "the first argument is dimensional reduction : the static large - distance behavior of a gauge theory at high temperatures is the same as of an effective euclidean three - dimensional gauge theory .",
    "the latter is confined on the scale @xmath84 , which means that the magnetic field in the original theory should also be confined at this scale .",
    "the second argument is that the high - temperature perturbation theory is ir divergent for momenta @xmath85 , and only a magnetic mass of this order could make the perturbation theory finite again .",
    "the third way is to notice that , due to the bose enhancement , the thermal fluctuations of the gauge field become so large at the scale @xmath84 that they are fully non - linear .",
    "the last argument does not necessarily imply magnetic screening ; it just shows that the existence of the latter at the scale @xmath84 does not contradict perturbative results , since at this scale the physics is non - perturbative .",
    "none of these three arguments can be carried over the case of high densities .",
    "first , there is no dimensional reduction for gauge theories with a finite chemical potential .",
    "second , the perturbation theory for the long - range magnetic field is infrared finite .",
    "indeed , in vacuum , the infrared divergences of one - loop graphs come from integrals like @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the gluon propagator . at finite @xmath1 ,",
    "the gluon propagator is modified as in eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) .",
    "now @xmath88 effectively scales like @xmath89 instead of @xmath90 , and by a simple power counting one sees that the integral is finite in the ir .",
    "therefore perturbation theory does not break down for momenta of order @xmath5 , or @xmath91 with any @xmath92 , and there is no reason to expect non - perturbative effects proportional to any finite power of @xmath3 .",
    "the third argument explicitly relies on the large bose enhancement that takes place only at finite temperatures ; this argument clearly does not work at finite densities .",
    "therefore , the magnetic interaction is not screened at the scale @xmath5 as is occasionally assumed .",
    "now let us return to the our problem and try to apply the formalism developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] to the interaction mediated by one - gluon exchange .",
    "we will see immediately that we have serious trouble with the very soft gluons .",
    "indeed , on the fermi surface , the tree - level small - angle ( @xmath93 ) scattering amplitude , due to one - gluon exchange , is @xmath94 the two contributions in the rhs come from the electric and the magnetic interaction , respectively ( again , the factor @xmath95 comes from considering only the @xmath68 channel . ) all partial amplitudes diverge logarithmically .",
    "for example , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the smallest allowed momentum exchange that one has to put in by hand to make @xmath98 finite .",
    "clearly , this ir problem renders the conventional rg formalism unusable .",
    "let us also warn against what might seem to be a natural solution to this ir problem . if one assumes that a quark condensate is eventually formed , the magnetic field is screened by the meissner effect .",
    "one may be tempted to take the inverse london penetration length @xmath99 as the cutoff in eq .",
    "( [ fdiverge ] ) , and use the computed value of @xmath98 to find the gap , thus obtaining a self - consistency condition for @xmath0 . in this way one does obtain a gap of order @xmath100 , where @xmath8 is some constant . however , this approach is flawed , and gives the wrong value of @xmath8 , because it entirely neglects the screening effect of landau damping which turns out to be much stronger than the meissner effect . to see this , note that the condensate smears out the fermi surface over a scale @xmath0 , which is the natural energy scale of quasiparticles near the fermi surface .",
    "the gluons that such excitations exchange have @xmath101 . on these frequencies",
    ", the dynamical magnetic screening happens already at the scale @xmath102 , which is much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the source of the ir cutoff should be the dynamical magnetic screening , which already takes place in the normal phase , rather than the meissner effect .",
    "let us now turn to the central part of this paper , where we will find the correct rg treatment of the theory with the color magnetic interaction .",
    "let us repeat the rg procedure described in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] . at",
    "any given step in the rg evolution , one keeps only fermion modes having energies smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "the start of the rg evolution , @xmath50 , will be taken at @xmath104 , and the evolution stops when @xmath103 is of order the gap , so typically @xmath105 .    at tree level ,",
    "the fermions interact via one - gluon exchange , characterized by the momentum of the gluon @xmath106 .",
    "since all fermions have energy less than @xmath103 , the energy of the gluon @xmath88 is naturally of order or less than @xmath103 , while the momentum exchange @xmath90 can be anywhere between 0 and @xmath107 .",
    "let us divide the four - fermion interaction that arises from the one - gluon exchange into `` instantaneous '' and `` non - instantaneous '' parts .",
    "the instantaneous interaction is mediated by the gluons that have momenta @xmath108 .",
    "the landau damping for these gluons is negligible , @xmath109 .",
    "the gluon propagator , which is now simply @xmath110 , does not depend on @xmath88 , which means that the four - fermion interaction they mediate can be considered as instantaneous .",
    "this part of the interaction is of the familiar type and will be treated in the conventional way . in particular , one can characterize this part by the partial - wave amplitudes @xmath47 . for @xmath111",
    ", the landau damping can no longer be neglected .",
    "this part of the interaction has a considerable temporal retardation and should be treated separately .",
    "now let us reduce @xmath103 by a factor of @xmath112 by integrating out fermion degrees of freedom with energy between @xmath113 and @xmath103 . during this process",
    "the following will occur :    \\1 .",
    "the partial - wave amplitudes @xmath47 obtain the conventional renormalization , as written in eq .",
    "( [ dfl / dt ] ) .",
    "one could ask if the non - instantaneous coupling is renormalized during this integration . to answer this question",
    ", one should compute the correction to the non - instantaneous interaction that comes from integrating out the fermion degrees of freedom . in appendix",
    "[ app : nonrenorm ] we explicitly estimate the corresponding one - loop diagrams and show that the non - instantaneous part of the interaction does not get renormalized .",
    "most importantly , and what makes our rg distinctive , _ part of the non - instantaneous interaction becomes instantaneous_. specifically , the gluon exchange with @xmath90 lying in the interval @xmath114 , which was formerly treated as non - instantaneous , now becomes a part of the instantaneous interaction and contributes to @xmath47 . simply speaking , our criterion of what to consider as instantaneous has became more inclusive , since we are now looking at a smaller energy scale , corresponding to a larger time scale .",
    "how much of the non - instantaneous part of the interaction transfers to the instantaneous part during one step of the rg ? according to eq.([ftheta ] ) and the non - renormalization of the non - instantaneous interaction , the increment in @xmath115 has the form , @xmath116 and vanishes outside this window of @xmath16 . for definiteness ,",
    "let us concentrate our attention to the @xmath60-wave amplitude @xmath98 .",
    "this amplitude obtains a constant additive contribution from the soft sector at each rg step , @xmath117 therefore , the rg group equation for @xmath98 now becomes , @xmath118 the second term in the rhs is the familiar term that gives rise to the bcs effect for short - range interactions . what is new is the first term , which takes into account the fact that softer and softer gluon exchanges contribute to @xmath47 .",
    "the non - instantaneous part of the interaction can be considered as an infinite pool , which continuously replenishes the instantaneous part during the rg evolution .",
    "clearly , this should speed up the approach to the landau pole .",
    "to secure a solution we also need to specify an initial condition on @xmath98 . recall that @xmath50 corresponds to @xmath104 , from eq.([ftheta ] ) one finds , to the leading logarithm , @xmath119 the solution to eq .",
    "( [ rg - eq ] ) with the initial condition ( [ rg - init ] ) is @xmath120\\ ] ] the coupling @xmath98 hits the landau pole when the argument of the tangent is equal @xmath121 .",
    "this happens when @xmath122 the fermi liquid description , thus , breaks down at the energy scale @xmath123 which will be interpreted as the scale of the gap .",
    "notice that the gap is proportional to @xmath100 , which is parametrically larger than the naive estimate @xmath71 at small @xmath3 .",
    "the reason for this enhancement is obviously the singularity of the magnetic interaction .    strictly speaking",
    ", the rg calculation does not tell us that @xmath0 is the value of the gap .",
    "in fact , the rg merely indicates that the normal fermi liquid behavior breaks down at the scale of @xmath0 . to confirm that @xmath0 is the gap",
    ", one needs to use some alternative approach . in appendix",
    "[ app : etheory ] , by making use of the eliashberg equation , borrowed from the physics of electron - phonon systems , we verify that the gap @xmath0 is in fact proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "we have found that the ground state of the system of quarks , interacting via one - gluon exchange , is basically a bcs - type superconductor , and found the weak - coupling behavior of the gap using the rg approach , appropriate in the presence of a long - range magnetic interaction .",
    "we found @xmath125 , @xmath7 , not @xmath126 as in conventional bcs theory .",
    "thus , at least in the @xmath72 limit , the superconductivity gap is larger than in all previous estimates @xcite . here",
    "let us make a few remarks on our calculation .",
    "_ wave function renormalization and non - fermi - liquid behaviors_. a similar problem of fermions interacting via an unscreened @xmath127 magnetic field has also generated considerable interest in condensed matter physics .",
    "the fermions may be the valence electrons in metals @xcite , in which case the @xmath127 field is the magnetic component of real electromagnetism , or some effective degrees of freedom in low - dimension strongly correlated electron systems @xcite , where the @xmath127 gauge interaction could be generated as an effective interaction . in metals ,",
    "the magnetic interaction is repulsive for a pair located on the opposite sides of the fermi surface , so it does not lead to bcs superconductivity .",
    "however , interesting phenomena may still arise from this repulsive interaction . in particular ,",
    "in has been shown @xcite that the weak magnetic interaction leads to the breakdown of the landau theory of fermi liquid , typically at extremely low temperatures .",
    "one could ask whether the effects leading to this non - fermi liquid behavior would modify our calculations .",
    "the basic idea is that the fermion wave function gets a large renormalization near the fermi surface from the magnetic interaction . to one - loop level",
    ", the renormalization of the wave function is @xcite @xmath128 if one goes arbitrarily close to the fermi surface , the wave function renormalization @xmath129 tends to 0 , which means that the discontinuity of the distribution function at the fermi surface disappears , thus signaling a deviation from landau s fermi liquid theory .",
    "however , in our case , the bcs effect is already essential at @xmath101 . recalling that @xmath130",
    ", we find from eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) that @xmath129 remains close to 1 , @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , one can safely ignore the renormalization of the wave function , and there is no chance for non - fermi - liquid behavior other than bcs - type superconductivity to manifest itself .",
    "we note here that it was suggested that an attractive magnetic - type interaction may arise in various situations in condensed matter physics , for example in double - layer electron systems .",
    "a bcs gap may emerge in such systems .",
    "due to a stronger singularity of the magnetic interaction in 2d , the gap is found to be proportional to a power of the coupling constant , rather than being exponential @xcite .    _ the very soft magnetic gluons_. in our rg approach , even after the final step of the rg evolution , the interaction still contains a non - instantaneous sector , which is carried by the magnetic gluons with energy @xmath132 and momentum @xmath133 .",
