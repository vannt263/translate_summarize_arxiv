    "so , similar to the more familiar cases @xmath36=3.9 , the results show that the spin ladder system with @xmath36=1 would be in a spin - liquid state . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) in the range of weak magnetic field h=0.6 t the spin gap for @xmath36=1 is estimated about 7.5k , and for @xmath36=3.9 is estimated 8.5k . in fig .",

    "the spin gap is estimated about 7.5k and 5k for @xmath36=3.9 and 1.0 respectively .",

    "so , temperature range of curie - weiss behavior and magnetic critical fields in our qmc simulation for the fm coupled ladders are one or two order of magnitude lower than experimental results of sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "[ fig5b](a ) shows that temperature dependence of the susceptibility curve is found to be strongly dependent on magnetic fields .",

    "the asymptotic behavior shows that the ground state of the system is in a magnetic order phase at @xmath44 . in principle , by adding the inter - ladder interaction the ground state of the system undergoes a quantum phase transition to a magnetic order phase in magnetic fields larger than @xmath13=1.0 t. qualitatively , there is a good similarity between the experimental results of sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 and our qmc calculation by considering the inter - ladder interaction @xcite .",

    "[ fig5b](a ) the curie - weiss behavior due to inter - ladder interaction shifts to higher temperature with increasing the value of the magnetic field .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the curie temperature about 20 k in the experimental results indicate the spin of cu atoms contribution on the chains . the upturn temperature in fig  [ fig5b](a )",
    "is one order of magnitude less than experimental results of sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 due to considering of small @xmath19 in our qmc simulation . the magnetic field to make",
    "disappear the gaped phase ( @xmath45=1.0 t ) is lower in the fm coupled two - leg ladder as compared with decoupled case .",
    "therefore such a small value of @xmath45 in fm coupled ladders places the physical properties of sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 in the vicinity of the tll phase .",
    "the gaped phase ( spin - singlet state ) is not clear in the reported range of the magnetic field , @xmath46 . since , increasing magnetic field from @xmath47 , breaks down the spin - singlet state and vanishes the gaped phase of the system .",
    "for the fm coupling less than @xmath5 , we found a temperature dependence for the susceptibility similar to the case of @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , as shown in fig .",

    "it is interesting to compare the evolution of critical magnetic field upon the considering of inter - ladder interaction . for this purpose",

    "[ fig6 ] , the value of magnetic field to create the spin polarized state in fm coupled ladders is smaller than the magnetic field in the decoupled ladder case .",
    "also , the upturn feature at the low temperatures is absent in the magnetization curves for the decoupled two - leg ladders . at higher temperatures the effects of the weak fm inter - ladder interaction are not significant .",

    "now , we also present the qmc results for the specific heat @xmath54 to find out the effect of inter - ladder fm exchange interaction in the spin-1/2 two - leg ladder systems .",
    "we consider the effect of inter - ladder interaction with the ratio of @xmath55 in the strong coupling limit i.e. @xmath30 , and @xmath56 , in order to see the changes of cross - over from one phase to the another phase .",
    "specially , we consider this effect within the range of @xmath48 ( tll phase ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) we have plotted @xmath54 curve for an isolated two - leg ladder system with the ratio of @xmath30 and afm two - leg ladders coupled fm with the same ratio . in both of them we observe a remarkable second peak at very low temperatures which is known as the indication of the existence of the tll phase . as expected , the inter - ladder interaction has not changed the behaviour of @xmath54 .",
