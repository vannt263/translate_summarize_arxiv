    "the properties of galaxies hosting long gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) were early on realized to give important clues on the nature of grbs @xcite . furthermore , it was also realized early on  in the so - called `` afterglow '' era , when the cosmological distance scale for long grbs was established ",
    "that grbs may be ideal tracers of ( massive ) star - formation throughout the observable universe .",
    "hence , a well selected sample of grb host galaxies could be used to characterize the properties of the various types of galaxies that dominate the cosmic star - formation as a function of cosmic epoch @xcite .",
    "prior to the currently very successful _ swift _",
    "satellite @xcite there were a number of published host studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main conclusion based on these and other pre-_swift _ studies were that the hosts of grbs are typically faint , star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "the median magnitude of pre-_swift _ hosts is about @xmath0 .",
    "however , these conclusions are based on incomplete samples as typically only about 30% of pre-_swift _ grbs",
    "are sufficiently well localized to allow an unambiguous host identification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , these conclusions may not be valid for grb hosts in general .    with the _ swift _ satellite",
    "the rate of well localized long grbs has gone up by about an order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , given the very rapid and precise localization , thanks primarily to the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on _ swift _ , the fraction of _ swift _ grbs without sub - arcsecond localization is now significantly smaller , and even based on the ( refined ) xrt positions alone it is possible to make interesting conclusions on the properties of the hosts .",
    "so far no systematic study of the hosts of _ swift _ grbs has been published .",
    "we here make a first attempt to characterize a sample of hosts related to _",
    "swift _ grbs based on relatively deep images collected at the danish 1.54 m telescope on la silla in chile .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we describe the observations and data set in section  [ s : obs_data ] and the photometric reductions in section  [ s : reductions ] .",
    "the results for our 24 grb fields ( 22 _ swift _ and two _ hete _ bursts ) are presented in section  [ s : results ] ; we derive upper limits for the brightness of the host for each grb and provide positions and magnitudes for the detected host galaxy candidates . in section  [",
    "s : comparison ] our photometric results for a subsample of 15 grb fields  i.e.  long _ swift _ grbs with confirmed optical transients ( ots )  are compared to the pre-_swift _ host sample of @xcite .",
    "our results give tentative evidence that grb host galaxies from the post-_swift _ era are fainter than those belonging to earlier host studies .",
    "section  [ s : summary ] summarizes our main findings .",
    "the data were obtained with the danish 1.54 m telescope at the european southern observatory on la silla , chile , 2005 october 24 to november 21 and 2006 february 19 to march 15 .",
    "the ccd detector on the dfosc ( danish faint object spectrograph and camera ) instrument has a current default readout area of 2148 @xmath1 2102 pixels , a pixel scale of 0.395 arcsec pix@xmath2 , a gain of 0.74 electrons adu@xmath2 , and a readout noise of 3.1 electrons .",
    "we selected our grb targets ( table  [ t : grb_info ] ) mainly based on observability at the two epochs of observations .",
    "priority was given to favorably placed grb fields , so high ( @xmath3 ) airmass targets were in some cases skipped .",
    "a discussion of the completeness of our sample can be found in section  [ s : comparison ] .",
    "images were taken in the bessel @xmath4- , @xmath5- , and @xmath6-band , as well as gunn @xmath7-band .",
    "we mostly took 600 s exposures which later were combined and stacked ; the first four columns of table  [ t : obs ] summarizes the data set and quote total exposure time and average seeing values in the different filters for the 24 grb fields in this sample . unless otherwise noted , all observations were performed well after the optical afterglow had faded .",
    "the images were pre - processed in the standard way using iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) . the bias level was subtracted using the overscan region on each science frame and a master bias frame computed from typically 1720 individual frames on each night .",
    "flat - fielding was performed exclusively by means of sky flats .",
    "dark current did not need to be corrected for as the dark level was found to be totally negligible .",
    "images taken in the @xmath7-band ( and to some extent the @xmath6-band ) were affected by fringing .",
    "we tried to minimize the effect on the photometry by carefully selecting the region from which the local sky level was estimated .",
    "the @xmath7-band images also suffered from a large gradient in the background level across the ccd frame ( from upper left to lower right corner ) , again making careful local background estimation important .",
    "individual frames were stacked in iraf with offsets according to the world coordinate system ( wcs ) keywords in the image headers .",
    "however , the original wcs information was incorrect and had to be re - computed first .",
    "we used sextractor @xcite for source detection on the individual images and then correlated the pixel positions with sky coordinates from the usno - b1.0 catalog2 . ]",
    "@xcite using the ` imwcs ` program in wcstools .",
    "the wcs fit was typically derived from 100200 objects in the generous 13.7@xmath8 field of view and allowed for a robust astrometric calibration . images with high sky values and/or short exposure times were down - weighted during the stacking .",
    "specifically , in iraf s ` imcombine ` task the frames were scaled and weighted by the exposure time , and the zero level offset was taken as the mode within a central region of the ccd frame .      for photometry we used an idl ( interactive data language ) code ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) featuring circular or elliptical apertures with correction for fractional pixels at the aperture border . centering was performed using paraboloidal representation of the nine central pixel values of the source in question @xcite .",
    "the local background level was calculated from several apertures arranged around the object of interest , and any apertures containing cosmics , sources etc .",
    "were automatically discarded .",
    "the photometric calibration was performed relative to the landolt ( @xmath9 ) system .",
    "zero - points , extinction coefficients and color terms were derived from observations of landolt standard fields on two nights with photometric conditions .",
    "color terms were negligible for all filters , except @xmath4 ( the color - correction term , @xmath10 , had @xmath11 ) .",
    "each grb field was calibrated using three to five comparison stars .",
    "we quote a detection limit , or upper limit , for all grbs in the sample .",
    "this parameter is a function of ( at least ) background noise and seeing .",
    "2@xmath12-limits were calculated in the following way : @xmath13 where zp is the photometric zero - point , @xmath14 is the aperture correction , @xmath15 is the radius of the circular detection aperture ( see below ) , and @xmath16 is a conservative measure of the background noise , i.e.  the standard deviation of the sky values .",
    "@xmath14 is the ratio between the total flux of the reference stars and the flux inside the detection aperture whose radius , @xmath15 , is set to 1.5 times the half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) .",
    "the hwhm was measured from the point - spread function ( psf ) on each image .",
    "the factor two inside the parenthesis corresponds to a 2@xmath12-limit .",
    "the stacked images of the 24 grb fields were examined with respect to objects in or near the _ swift _ xrt error circle and other reported positions , i.e.  from afterglow observations in various bands mainly from ground - based telescopes .",
    "we use the new , refined _ swift _ xrt positions and errors presented in @xcite , which are determined by matching x - ray field source positions directly to those of counterpart optical sources .",
    "we also note that several _",
    "swift_-uvot ( uv / optical telescope ) positions for the afterglows are inconsistent with the refined xrt error circle and ot positions from other groups .",
    "a detection limit , i.e.  upper limit for the brightness of the host , was derived for each grb field , and photometry was performed for the cases where we found probable host galaxy candidates . each object in our grb sample is treated below ; please consult fig .",
    "[ f : grbs ] , table  [ t : grb_info ] and table  [ t : obs ] for details about the target grbs , the data ( filter , exposure time , and seeing ) and for @xmath17 detection limits , photometry and positions of host galaxy candidates . the upper limits and host galaxy magnitudes in table  [ t : obs ] are not corrected for foreground galactic extinction . the reader will also find that the detection limit ( column 5 ) typically is different for images with roughly the same exposure time and seeing ; this is mainly due to differences in moon illumination and sky brightness .",
    "quite often positions of afterglow candidates in gcn circulars are lacking error estimates , and in such cases we adopt a 0@xmath185 error radius in the figures .",
    "also , we only include optical afterglow positions which have been reported to be _ transient_. the tables , the mosaic figure ( from upper left to lower right ) and the following subsections are all arranged chronologically . throughout this paper",
    "we use a ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) = ( 0.3,0.7 ) cosmology with hubble constant @xmath21 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",

    "finally , dust maps from @xcite were used to correct for foreground galactic extinction .",
    "the ab magnitudes of both our and @xcite s sample encompass bands from the visible to the red ; this will widen the host magnitude distributions compared to samples observed with a single filter , but this fact should not seriously affect the conclusions we draw below .",
    "the rationale for performing monte carlo simulations is that we want to see how many host galaxies we would have detected had the distribution of host magnitudes of our targets matched that of the @xcite sample .",
    "this will be compared to the four host detections we claim ( concerning grbs 050416 , 050826 , 050915 , and 051016b ) .",
    "we need to quantify the @xcite host magnitude distribution ; this was done by fitting a beta distribution function , with parameters @xmath110 ( which allows for skewness ) to the magnitude histogram , see the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ f : fruchter_hist ] .",
    "even though the sample contains 43 hosts , the sampling is rather sparse in the wings .",
    "we tried fitting different functions to the histogram , but this did not significantly change the end results of the analysis .    using the beta probability density function as an approximation of the host magnitude distribution in @xcite , one can draw magnitudes ( using a random seed ) and then compare them one by one to our 15 upper limits . if the magnitude drawn is less ",
    "i.e.  brighter  than the upper limit ( transformed to the ab photometric system and corrected for foreground galactic extinction , as described above ) it is recorded as a host detection . having done this for all the 15 upper limits one finally sums the number of detections . this procedure is repeated @xmath111 times , thus producing a distribution of the number of host detections , see fig .",
    "[ f : mc ] .",
    "( we also checked that the simulated magnitudes based on the fitted beta distribution was comparable to the original @xcite sample .",
    "the mean of the simulated values was exactly the same as for the original sample , and the median and the scatter was also similar . )    while we found _ four _ host galaxies out of our 15 grb subsample , the mean number of detected host galaxies from the simulations is 9.0 , with a standard deviation of 1.8 .",
    "in fact , 99.3% of the monte carlo simulations yielded five or more host detections .",
    "this confidence level should not be taken at face value due to the statistical incompleteness of the samples .",
    "this coupled with the fact that the possible biases and selection effects in each of them are hard to quantify , makes a definite and quantitative conclusion impossible .",
    "we have in this exercise simply tried to constrain our observed grb targets in the same way ( solely long grbs with confirmed ot ) as in the @xcite sample and then performed monte carlo runs to investigate whether the two samples are comparable .",
    "the above simulations indicate that the _ swift _ grb host sample presented here is fainter than the pre-_swift _ host sample of @xcite while this can not be extended to hosts in general due to the incompleteness of both samples , we do consider it tentative evidence of fainter _ swift _ hosts . concerning possible biases , we want to make a couple of comments .",
    "since grbs which were undetected in ground - based follow - ups often were later chosen as targets for the hst programs on which the @xcite data is based , one could argue that this would bias the @xcite sample towards the faint end of the pre-_swift _ host luminosity function .",
    "if so , this would strengthen our findings .",
    "secondly , large galactic extinctions can not explain or contribute to the faintness of our grb hosts , as only one field ( i.e.  grb 050826 , whose host is in fact detected ) has significant foreground extinction .",
    "to summarize , we detect four hosts in a subsample of 15 grbs selected using comparable criteria to that of @xcite .",
    "assuming , for a moment , that the host magnitude distribution of @xcite is universal , we would expect to detect some 711 hosts given our observing conditions . if we had observed every _",
    "swift_-detected grb field observable from la silla during our two runs we should have detected about twice as many hosts , i.e.  about 18 . to achieve this",
    "we would have to detect a host for just about every remaining unobserved grb field .",
    "we can not find a plausible reason why our observed sample should be selected in such a heavily biased way .",
    "it seems reasonable that the most natural explanation for our observed lower - than - expected rate of host detections is that the hosts are fainter than the @xcite sample .",
    "the large observational data set of 24 grb fields obtained with the danish 1.54 m telescope on la silla have been used to search for the galaxies hosting these bursts .",
    "new , previously unpublished , host galaxy candidates are presented for grbs 050915 and 051021 .",
    "we also suggest possible hosts for grbs 050412 , 050714b , 050826 , 051006 , and 051117b ; these objects are reported in early gcn circulars as part of the search for the ot , but since we detect them months after the bursts they are not transient sources and , consequently , qualify as at least candidate hosts .",
    "photometry for the host galaxies of grbs 050416 , 051016b , and 051022 is also provided .",
    "these galaxies already have measured redshifts from emission lines , but to our knowledge no previously published photometry .",
    "magnitudes ( not corrected for galactic extinction ) and positions are given in table  [ t : obs ] , as well as upper limits in various photometric bands for the non - detections .",
    "we fail to detect more than half of the hosts in our grb sample , despite rather deep limits .",
    "these fields , along with a couple of our marginal detections , e.g.  grbs 050915 and 051021 , should be imaged with larger telescopes . likewise , the new host candidates presented here are prime targets for spectroscopic follow - up to determine the redshift and probe extinction , star - formation rate etc .",
    "redshift determinations for the hosts would also fix the energy and time scale of the bursts and afterglows , and thus contribute to the increasing data base and knowledge on the grb phenomenon .",
    "it is worth noting that as far as detected sources ( not necessarily grb hosts ) inside or on the border of the _ swift _ xrt error circle are concerned , they seem to be brighter ( and apparently larger ) for bursts which have no detected ot . from our sample ,",
    "the median ab magnitude of sources inside the xrt error circle of such grbs is 21.8 , whilst the corresponding value for the galaxies hosting grbs _ with _ optical afterglows is 23.6 mag .",
    "this is admittedly small number statistics , but it could be an indication that galaxies hosting grbs with very faint or even missing ots belong to a different population ( i.e.  more dusty galaxies with more homogeneously distributed star - formation ) than galaxies hosting grbs with optical afterglows .",
    "( we avoid referring to grbs without a detected ot as `` dark '' bursts , as there are no generally accepted criteria for what constitutes an optically dark grb . )",
    "our monte carlo simulations indicate that the host galaxy sample presented here ( i.e.  the 15 grb fields corresponding to long , _ swift_-detected , ot - confirmed grbs ) is fainter than the pre- _ swift _ sample in @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that they are more distant than the hosts in @xcite this is in accordance with the observation that _ swift _ grbs are at higher average redshift than pre- _ swift _ bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , grbs detected by the _",
    "swift _ satellite provide a better insight into the early history of the universe .",
    "the faintness of the grb host galaxies calls for more extensive observation efforts with large 8 m class or space telescopes in order to construct any representative sample of grb host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
