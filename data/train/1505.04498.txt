    "although instantons are essential ingredients in qcd , it is difficult to understand their dynamics because of the strong coupling nature of the theory .",

    "hence we may have to rely on numerical calculations in lattice gauge theory to illuminate their properties .",
    "one possible tool for analyzing instantons is holographic qcd proposed by witten @xcite .",
    "although holographic qcd is different from real qcd in quantitive details , it has successfully explained various qualitative aspects of large-@xmath9 qcd @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for recent developments . )",
    "hence we expect that holography can also reveal the natures of instantons .",
    "in particular , we focus on the dynamics of instantons at finite temperature in this study .    through holographic qcd , instantons at low temperature ( in confinement phase ) have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the energy of an instanton with a particular size approaches to zero in the large-@xmath9 limit , which indicates the large fluctuations of the topological charge in the confinement phase .",
    "this is consistent with the previous theoretical insights @xcite and numerical calculations in lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "however , dynamics of instantons in deconfinement phase is less clear .",
    "although the perturbative calculations work in certain circumstances @xcite , the whole instanton dynamics has not been understood .",
    "their dynamics around the critical temperature would be particularly important to reveal the mechanism of the phase transition , and hence it is interesting to study it in holographic qcd . in this direction , the black d4-brane geometry @xcite , which was supposed to be",
    "the gravity dual of the deconfinement phase , has been studied initially . in particular , some agreements with the expected properties of the instantons were reported in ref .",
    "however there are also some disagreements .",
    "for example , the instanton density @xmath10 , which is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the single qcd instanton with a size @xmath11 at temperature @xmath12 , shows unexpected behaviours . in holographic qcd , the instanton density is calculated from the dbi action of a d0-brane @xcite , and the result in the black d4-brane background is given by @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a dimensionless t hooft coupling which we will define below equation ( [ metric - sd4 ] ) .",
    "thus it does not depend on either @xmath11 or @xmath12 if @xmath15 , and the size of the instanton is a moduli in this region .    however , both perturbative qcd and numerical calculation in lattice gauge theory predict different results .",
    "perturbative qcd predicts that the instanton density for a small instanton at @xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the coupling at scale @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "thus small instantons are suppressed . at high temperature @xmath19 in the deconfinement phase , because of the electric screening , large instantons would be suppressed .",
    "indeed the perturbative calculation shows the large instanton suppression as @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "although the perturbative calculations are valid only in limited parameter regimes , such suppressions of small and large instantons would hold for any temperature in the deconfinement phase , and then the instanton density would have a peak at a finite value . actually this tendency has been observed in lattice calculations in the deconfinement phase @xcite .",
    "these results clearly disagree with the holographic result ( [ dbi - d0 ] ) in the black d4-brane geometry .",
    "although holographic qcd can not reproduce the actual qcd results quantitatively in principle @xcite , qualitative aspects of qcd are expected to be captured .",
    "hence this discrepancy is a serious puzzle in holographic qcd .",
    "more recently , it has been argued that the black d4-brane geometry can not be identified with the deconfinement phase in four - dimensional qcd ; rather , a geometry called localized solitonic d3-brane will correspond to the deconfinement phase in qcd @xcite .",
    "in this article , we study the instantons in this new setup , and see that the instanton density obtained from the localized d3-brane geometry satisfies the expectations from qcd .",
    "we find that the size distribution of the instantons is peaked at a finite value , and becomes delta - functional at large-@xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , the topology of the gravity dual of the stable instantons differs from that of the small ones .",
    "also , we will see that fluctuations of the topological charge , which is large in the confinement phase and suppressed in the deconfinement phase , would smoothly change at the gross - witten - wadia type ( gww ) point @xcite .",

    "it would indicate that the potential ( [ potential - u - large - u ] ) at large @xmath37 continues to the value ( [ largeinst ] ) .",
    "recall that the topologies of the d1-brane at large @xmath37 and @xmath122 are different , and the topology change occurs when the d1-brane reaches the `` horizon '' of the soliton .",
    "since the value of the classical action is related to the area of the d1-brane , it would be continuous through the topology change",
    ". however , its ( higher ) derivative with respect to some deformation parameters of the d1-brane may not be continuous .",
    "we have calculated the dbi action of the d1-branes .",
    "now we argue the relation between the size @xmath11 of the qcd instantons and the radial location @xmath37 of the d1-branes , as we have done for the confinement phase in section [ sec - confinement ] .",
    "the relation is more complicated than that for the confinement geometry ( [ metric - sd4 ] ) , since we have taken the t - dual on the temporal circle and the energy in the iia frame would appear in an unusual manner .",
    "furthermore , the metric can analytically be expressed only by a couple of the approximated forms for two patches .",
    "fortunately the asymptotic metric ( [ metric - ld3-large - u ] ) has an approximate isometry along the temporal circle if @xmath37 is sufficiently large , and we can consider the iia frame by taking the t - dual again . there",
    "the typical enegy scale is @xmath70 for the d1-brane which is located at @xmath37 .",
    "this is the same scale to that of the confinement geometry , since the localised d3-brane geometry asymptotically approaches to the smeared d3-brane geometry @xcite , which is the t - dual of the confinement geometry ( [ metric - sd4 ] ) .    for the near d3-brane metric ( [ metric - near - region ] ) , the isometry along the temporal circle is broken .",
    "hence the t - dual picture in the iia side is not clear and it is hard to see the relation .",
    "if we consider only the near region , there typical energy scales would be naively @xmath153 and @xmath154 for the d1-brane located at @xmath111 .",
    "however we need to consider the connection to the asymptotic region , where the aforementioned different scalings arise , to estimate the energy of the gauge theory on the boundary .",
    "( see footnote [ ftnt - instanton - size ] and @xcite . ) furthermore , the d1-brane for the stable configuration at @xmath122 is stretched along @xmath111 direction , and it makes the situation more complicated",
    ".    however , for small instantons the contribution of the near region would be irrelevant and the asymptotic metric ( [ metric - ld3-large - u ] ) would dominate for obtaining the relation to the instanton size",
    ". then it would be possible that the @xmath155 relation ( [ instanton - size - u ] ) in the confinement geometry holds approximately even in the deconfinement phase . under this assumption , the dbi action ( [ potential - u - large - u ] ) is rewritten as @xmath156 the value of this action is larger for smaller @xmath11 and it suggests that the small size instanton would be suppressed .    for the stable d1-brane at @xmath122 , we can not estimate the instanton size because of the difficulties mentioned above .",
    "however the distance between the d1-brane at @xmath122 and the boundary ( @xmath157 ) is finite , which implies that the instanton size for the d1-brane at @xmath122 would be finite .",
    "we presume that this corresponds to the largest instanton in qcd and a larger instanton is not allowed .",
    "thus the instanton density would have a sharp peak at this value of @xmath11 at large-@xmath9 .",
    "although we can not calculate this largest size , we can estimate the lower bound for this size by using the relation ( [ instanton - size - u ] ) in the asymptotic region and substituting @xmath158 , @xmath159 note that this lower bound of the peak size ( [ rho - vev ] ) increases as @xmath12 decrease and reaches @xmath160 around @xmath161 , which is the same order to the peak size of the instanton in the confinement phase ( [ rho - peak ] ) .",
    "( [ potential - u_h ] ) obtained from the potential ( [ potential - u - large - u ] ) for large @xmath37 is the same order to the dbi action at @xmath122 ( [ largeinst ] ) .",

    "we have studied the instantons in the deconfinement phase .",
    "the results show that the instanton density has the sharp peak at a finite instanton size but the energy at this size is still finite .",
    "this implies that the topological fluctuation would be suppressed in the deconfinement phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the zero energy of the instantons in the confinement phase implies the large fluctuation of the topological charge . to confirm this picture",
    ", we investigate the instanton effects in @xmath23-vacuum and estimate the topological susceptibility @xmath152 , which is defined by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath23 parameter : @xmath163 we show that the topological susceptibility is indeed suppressed in the localized d3-brane geometry consistently with the finite value of the dbi action .",
    "we first recall the topological charge at low temperature @xcite .",
    "the confinement phase corresponds to the solitonic d4-brane geometry , and the instanton is described by the ( euclidean ) d0-brane wrapped on the @xmath25-direction .",
    "thus the topological charge corresponds to the `` rr - charge '' and can be estimated from the configuration of the rr 1-form @xmath164 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 , which is the chemical potential of the instanton , corresponds to the boundary condition of @xmath164 ; @xmath165 where integration is over @xmath27 , which is @xmath25-direction at the boundary @xmath166 . in the case of the solitonic d4-brane geometry",

    "it can be written in terms of the field strength @xmath168 ; @xmath169 this implies that the field strength is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "then , the classical action for the bulk rr - field is estimated as ; @xmath170 therefore , the free energy has finite quadratic term of @xmath23 , indicating the topological susceptibility @xmath152 is finite .",
    "thus the fluctuation of the topological charge is large @xcite .",
    "now , we turn to the localized d3-brane geometry . in this case",
    ", the instanton corresponds to the d1-brane which is wrapped on the torus @xmath132 of the @xmath171-plane .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is related to the boundary condition of the rr 2-form @xmath172 ; @xmath173 where the integration is performed at the boundary @xmath166 .",
    "in order to see the contributions of this boundary condition to the free energy , we consider the stokes theorem ; @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the field strength associated to @xmath172 and @xmath176 is the three - dimensional space of @xmath177 .",
    "the @xmath98 circle of @xmath25 shrinks to a point at @xmath178 , which can approximately be expressed in the @xmath179-coordinates as @xmath180 thus the @xmath25-direction can shrink only at @xmath181 .",
    "the space continues to @xmath122 in the other region , and connected to the opposite side of @xmath182 .",
    "then , the boundary of @xmath176 consists of two tori , @xmath183 and @xmath184 at @xmath157 with opposite angles , and the stokes theorem provides us with @xmath185 where the minus sign in the last term comes from the difference of the orientation for two tori .",
    "the 2-form field @xmath172 takes the same value on @xmath183 and @xmath184 since they are the opposite points on @xmath182 and we assume that the solution has the spherical symmetry .",
    "this implies cancellation in the r.  h.  s. , and hence , the field strength is not constrained by @xmath23 .",
    "thus the topological susceptibility @xmath152 vanishes and the fluctuation is suppressed as we expected .",
    "@xcite , even though it does not provide the correct instanton density . in this case , @xmath186 plane is terminated at the horizon , and hence it has the topology of the cylinder .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is given in terms of the rr 1-form by @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the @xmath25 circle at the horizon .",
    "now @xmath189 can be zero by adjusting the second term according to @xmath23 , and then , the topological susceptibility @xmath152 is zero .",
    "we can explain @xmath190 in a similar fashion even in the case of the localized d3-branes .",
    "if we restrict @xmath177 plane to @xmath191 by using the spherical symmetry on @xmath182 , the integration of @xmath172 at @xmath122 appears instead of the last term in .",
    "it can be adjusted such that it cancels the integration of @xmath172 at the boundary . ]",
    "as we have shown in section [ sec - deconfinement ] , the dbi action of the d1-brane in the localized solitonic d3-brane geometry remains finite and the topological charge fluctuation is exponentially suppressed even at the critical temperature ( [ gl - t ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the confinement / deconfinement transition ( gl transition ) is of first order .    as in fig .",
    "[ fig - free_energy ] , the localized d3-brane branch is connected to the confinement geometry ( uniformly smeared d3-brane ) through the non - uniformly smeared d3-brane geometry . by tracking this",
    ", we can see how the physics in the deconfinement phase changes to that in the confinement phase .",
    "then an important question is where and how the suppression of the topological fluctuation in the localized d3-brane geometry changes to the large fluctuation in the confinement geometry .",
    "we propose that it will occur at the merger point where the localized solitonic d3-brane geometry merges to the non - uniformly smeared solitonic d3-brane geometry and the topology changes .",
    "since there is no `` gap '' along @xmath48-circle in the non - uniform d3-brane geometry similar to the uniform d3-brane geometry , the dbi action of the d1-brane in this geometry can be zero .",
    "on the other hand in the localized d3-brane geometry , due to the existence of the gap , the dbi action is finite . as this gap is becoming smaller",
    ", the dbi action will be smaller and would reach zero at the merger point .",
    "therefore the continuous transition would occur at the merger point .",
    "this is also consistent with the analysis in the @xmath23-vacuum .",
    "if the geometry has only single boundary , the field strength of the rr - field is constrained by @xmath23 and the topological susceptibility becomes finite . in the localized d3-brane geometry",
    ", @xmath25-direction does not shrink in a specific region and then , the 3-form flux reach to the opposite side of @xmath182 .",
    "this effectively plays the role of different two boundaries .",
    "however , the `` gap '' would close at the merger point , and then , the flux can not pass to the opposite side .",
    "this implies that the topological fluctuation is not suppressed at the merger point .",
    "recall that the merger point will correspond to the gross - witten - wadia type transition point in the gauge theory @xcite , where the topology of the eigenvalue distribution of the polyakov loop operator changes .",
    "it indicates that the topology of the eigenvalue distribution of the polyakov loop is crucial for the topological fluctuation in qcd .",
    "it sounds reasonable since both the polyakov loop and instantons are related to the configurations of the gauge fields .    on the other hand ,",
    "the translation symmetry along @xmath48-circle , which is broken in both the localized d3-brane and the non - uniformly smeared d3-brane geometry , is not critical for the topological fluctuation .",

    "<S> we investigate instantons in finite temperature qcd via witten s holographic qcd . to study the deconfinement phase , we use the setup proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sizes of the instantons are stabilized at certain values both in the confinement and deconfinement phases . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the numerical result in the lattice gauge theory . besides we find that the gravity duals of the large and small instantons in the deconfinement phase have different topologies . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that the fluctuation of the topological charges is large in confinement phase while it is exponentially suppressed in deconfinement phase , and a continuous transition occurs at the gross - witten - wadia ( gww ) point . </S>",
    "<S> it would be difficult to observe the counterpart of this transition in lattice qcd , since the gww point in qcd may stay at an unstable branch .    </S>",
