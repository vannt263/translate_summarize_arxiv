    "<S> we describe in detail the application of the recent non - abelian density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm to the two dimensional t - j model . </S>",
    "<S> this extension of the dmrg algorithm allows us to keep the equivalent of twice as many basis states as the conventional dmrg algorithm for the same amount of computational effort , which permits a deeper understanding of the nature of the ground state .    since the discovery of superconductivity in the rare - earth copper oxides there has been a growing interest in strongly correlated electronic systems . the t - j model proposed by anderson ( 1987 ) , and </S>",
    "<S> zhang and rice ( 1988 ) is an example of this interest . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions and implications of the model are possibly relevant and useful for a deeper understanding , particularly , the high temperature superconductors , and in generally the motion of `` holes '' in an antiferromagnet .    </S>",
    "<S> it is conceptually a simple model and has been already widely studied in relation to the high temperature superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> however , it belongs to the class of systems which do not obey the condition of perron - frobenuis ( yosida 1980 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this condition states that if the off - diagonal elements of a matrix are all non - positive and if the matrix is not in a block diagonal form then the ground state eigenvalue is non - degenerate . in the case of the t - j </S>",
    "<S> hamiltonian the off - diagonal elements are not all non - positive . </S>",
    "<S> thus the above theorem can not be applied , which implies that the phenomenon of ground state level crossing is present ( itoyama , mccoy and perk 1990 ) . as a direct consequence of this </S>",
    "<S> , the thermodynamic system will be unstable against phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as is known ( blatt and weisskopf 1979 ) , in three - dimension , the system will collapse to arbitrarily high density . in two - dimensions </S>",
    "<S> we have the argument of emery , kivelson and lin ( 1990 ) that the model is unstable against phase separation into hole - rich and no - hole phase .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that interchanging particles of different spin leads to a strong coupling between the kinetic and spin degrees of freedom(barnes 1989 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in different dimensions the model will represent different cases . </S>",
    "<S> phase separation occurs also in one dimension , but for different values of the band filling and interaction strength than in the higher dimension case . in two dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> it was argued that phase separation corresponds to stripe formation ( hellberg and manousakis 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> stripe formation is one of the most controversial issues in the study of high temperature superconductors , where there is a phase separation of the holes which is limited to short range by , e.g. , coulomb forces , and orders in striped structures . </S>",
    "<S> many experiments have found evidence for stripes and they arise in a number of different theories involving strong correlations ( zaanen and gunnarsson 1989 ; kivelson , emery and lin 1990 ; zaanen , horbach and van saarloos 1996 ; white and scalapino 1998 ) .    the first direct proof of the existence of a stripe ground state emerged from t - j model calculations ( white and scalapino 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is that the t - j model inherits all the exchange hole correlations resulting from the antiparallel spin correlations in the @xmath0 limit of the fermi sea . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if stripes do exist , they will be more robust in the t - j model . </S>",
    "<S> stripes have been studied by a number of numerical techniques in the t - j model , unfortunately resulting in conflicting conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> a major question is if stripes are part of the known phase separated regime of the t - j model ( hellberg and manousakis 1999 ) or they represent a different ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this is the focus of our study .    </S>",
    "<S> using the recent developed non - abelian dmrg ( mcculloch and gulacsi 2000 ) we study the ground state of the two dimensional t - j model in the vicinity of @xmath1 and for different size square lattices up to 24x6 . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly find , for our choice of boundary conditions , a striped ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we have also noticed that in the phase separated regimes , the holes are attracted to the open boundary , while in the stripe regime , the holes are repelled by the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this is evidence that that stripes are different from a usual phase transition phenomena , but also indicates that there are large finite size effects arising from the existence of the open boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - abelian dmrg algorithm is numerically similar to the `` interaction round a face '' ( irf ) dmrg ( sierra and nishino 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the decomposition of the hamiltonian into the blocks used by the dmrg algorithm is significantly different between the two algorithms . in irf - dmrg , </S>",
    "<S> the vertex hamiltonian is first transformed into an irf model , and then a variant of dmrg is applied to the irf hamiltonian . in the non - abelian case , </S>",
    "<S> the standard dmrg algorithm is generalized so that the block operators transform as irreducible representations of an arbitrary compact group ( in this case @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a true generalization of the original dmrg algorithm ( white 1992 , 1993 ) , in the sense that if the global symmetry group is chosen to be @xmath3 , as in the usual @xmath4 basis used in dmrg , the original dmrg algorithm is recovered exactly . in this paper , we fill in the details required to apply the non - abelian algorithm to the 2 dimensional @xmath5 model , in the basis given by particle number , @xmath6 , and total spin , @xmath7 , giving the global symmetry group @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the results of this choice of basis with previous calculations using the usual @xmath4 basis , and comment on the conclusions that can be inferred from the dmrg calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 hamiltonian is @xmath9 defined on the subspace of no double occupancy , and @xmath10 means summation over nearest neighbour pairs only . </S>",
    "<S> the single site operators act on the usual three dimensional t - j basis of an empty site ( hole ) , a single up spin and a single down spin . </S>",
    "<S> the difference for non - abelian dmrg is that the spin up and spin down states form an @xmath2 multiplet of dimension 2 , thus reducing the single site basis to two states ; a hole ( transforming as the @xmath11 $ ] representation of @xmath8 ) and a single spin ( transforming as the @xmath12 $ ] representation of @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the single site operators are represented as @xmath13 matrices acting on these states . </S>",
    "<S> the block basis states used in each step of the dmrg iteration are labelled @xmath14 , which denotes the @xmath15th state of @xmath16 particles and total spin @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements of the single site operators are simply the _ reduced matrix elements _ given by the wigner - eckart theorem ( biedenharn and louck 1981 ) , written here in our @xmath8 basis , @xmath17 for the @xmath18th component of an operator @xmath19 transforming as the @xmath20 $ ] representation of @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> the hamiltonian itself transforms as the @xmath11 $ ] identity representation . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the interaction between two nearest neighbour sites @xmath39 in the non - abelian representation requires summing 4 distinct terms , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the @xmath4 basis , there are 8 terms : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although the matrix elements of the single site operators are more difficult to calculate using the non - abelian formulation , there are correspondingly fewer matrix elements and operators required .    </S>",
    "<S> we have applied this dmrg algorithm to the two dimensional t - j model by unrolling the two dimensional lattice into a one dimensional model with long range interactions , following the worm approach ( liang and pang 1994 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use periodic boundary conditions in the y direction and open boundary conditions in the ( generally longer ) x direction . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , we would like to perform the calculations with periodic boundary conditions in both directions , but this would substantially increase the number of states required . </S>",
    "<S> although the resulting one dimensional worm model is reflection symmetric at the midpoint of the lattice , it is difficult to make use of this symmetry in dmrg calculations due to the non - uniform nature of the ground state . as a dmrg sweep progresses from one end of the system towards the centre point , the holes and spins tend to distribute themselves in a slightly asymmetric way between the left and right halves of the system , so that when the centre point is reached the left block basis is biased towards states that have too few holes , and the right block basis is biased towards states that have too many holes ( or vice versa ) . enforcing reflection symmetry by using only one block plus its spatial reflection thus leads to a catastrophic reduction in the number of admissible superblock states , and a corresponding jump in the energy at that dmrg iteration . in all two dimensional models , constructing the initial state for the finite dmrg sweeps is more problematic than on one dimension . in one dimension </S>",
    "<S> , the so - called infinite dmrg algorithm produces quite good results by itself , and usually provides a ground state that is qualitatively very similar to the converged finite dmrg state . in two dimensions </S>",
    "<S> however , the reduced translation symmetry of the unrolled one dimensional worm means that a genuine infinite style algorithm would be rather difficult . </S>",
    "<S> while there are many possible ways to construct the initial blocks , we use the simple approach of constructing the initial blocks in place ; that is , starting from an initial 4 site system consisting of the 2 extreme sites from the left and right ends of the worm and adding two sites at a time , one from each end of the worm , working towards the centre of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for most of the warm - up sweeps , there are no interaction terms between the left and right blocks . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative procedure is to rotate the system 90 degrees , so that the opposite ends of the worm are connected on the periodic boundary . </S>",
    "<S> however this introduces many more interactions between the left and right blocks throughout the calculation , which impacts on the accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to introduce extra interactions for the warm - up sweep only , but we have not yet investigated this option . with no interactions between the two blocks , the eigenstates of the block density matrix </S>",
    "<S> coincide with the eigenstates of the block hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> thus there will only be a single non - zero density matrix eigenvalue ( more , if the ground state is degenerate ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is that , until the first inter - block interaction appears , @xmath51 of the block eigenstates are essentially random vectors . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state can be specified further by manipulating the target state as a function of system size . </S>",
    "<S> we have done this to obtain various initial condition : a state with all holes uniformly distributed , a phase separated state , and several random states .    </S>",
    "<S> we have made calculations for various lattice sizes , keeping up to 1200 basis states per block . </S>",
    "<S> table 1 shows a comparison of the ground state energy as a function of the number of basis states kept , using the @xmath22 and @xmath8 basis , for a typical point in the striped regime ( white and scalapino 1999 ; xiang , lou and su 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 symmetry provides a saving of a factor of two in the number of block states required . </S>",
    "<S> this is very significant as the computational complexity of the dmrg algorithm scales as at least @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> however , even with 1200 states kept in the @xmath8 basis ( equivalent to around 2500 states in the @xmath53 basis ) , the achieved energy is around @xmath54 higher than the estimated true ground state energy . </S>",
    "<S> this compares very poorly with the accuracies generally achieved by dmrg for one dimensional models .    in dmrg </S>",
    "<S> , the ground state wavefunction is iteratively improved , but only locally . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to a situation where the dmrg converges self - consistently to an incorrect state , depending on the initial conditions and the details of the algorithm ( scalapino and white 2000 ) . in many cases , for a small number of states </S>",
    "<S> ( but still relatively large compared with traditional dmrg studies ) we have observed qualitatively different dmrg wavefunctions , depending on how we perform the warm - up sweep . </S>",
    "<S> we have also observed different converged wavefunctions even with the same initial condition , simply by varying the the rate at which the number of basis states per block is increased as the dmrg sweeps progress . </S>",
    "<S> for example , with the @xmath55 system used in table 1 , using 500 basis states in the @xmath8 basis , the ground state is most likely a two stripe configuration in agreement with ( white and scalapino 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we increase the number of retained states at a faster rate so that it takes fewer sweeps to reach the final total , we actually obtain a three stripe configuration . </S>",
    "<S> it is not until we increased the number of states to 800 that the three stripe configuration moves out of this local minima and formed the two stripe configuration . </S>",
    "<S> simply doing more dmrg sweeps with 500 states is not effective .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible way of dealing with this problem is to compare the energies of the competing dmrg ground states . </S>",
    "<S> the problem with this approach is that dmrg only provides a variational upper bound on the energy , and that the goodness of the variational energy ( and therefore the truncation error associated with the dmrg state ) can depend significantly on the nature of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this requires extrapolating the energies of both states to zero truncation error , showing that the difference in energy is statistically significant . </S>",
    "<S> this is a very time consuming procedure . in this paper , we only report results where we have a unique ground state , independent of the initial conditions ( at least for the initial conditions we have used ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the problem of multiple candidate ground states depending on the initial conditions deteriorates rather quickly as the system size increases . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one does nt need to increase the system size too far before the dmrg fails to converge to a believable ground state at all , at least in a reasonable number of sweeps .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the hole density along the x direction for a fixed number of holes , as the system size is increased . as the size grows , </S>",
    "<S> the stripes tend to move further apart while keeping approximately the same width , although it is difficult to make any real conclusions about the stripe width from this limited data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the width of the fluctuations in the real space density may be much larger than the correlation width of the stripe itself , if the stripe is delocalized . </S>",
    "<S> that depends on how much effect the boundary conditions have in pinning the stripes . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the effect of reducing the number of holes to 6 , for the @xmath55 case . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state we observed is curious in that it breaks spatial reflection symmetry , but it provides evidence that it is energetically favourable to form a normal stripe of hole density 4/6 and one proto stripe , of hole density 2/6 , rather than two stripes of equal hole density , or a single stripe . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests , as with the results from fig .  1 , that that the thermodynamic hole density per stripe is a constant ( which depends on j / t ) .    in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  3 </S>",
    "<S> , we attempt to find the optimal filling per stripe , by increasing the system size and number of holes by 50% , to a @xmath56 lattice with 12 holes . </S>",
    "<S> since we consistently obtain three stripes , this limits the hole density per unit length of the stripes to @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the largest system that we could study , while still being reasonably certain that the obtained ground state is substantially independent of the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for these parameters and boundary conditions , the two dimensional t - j model almost certainly has a striped ground state , and doping the system changes the density of stripes while the number of holes per stripe remains constant . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult , however , to extrapolate these results to make definite conclusions about the nature of the ground state of the t - j model in the thermodynamic limit . because of the half - periodic boundary conditions , the hole density is constant in the y direction . </S>",
    "<S> thus any fluctuation in the hole density across the system , pinned by the open boundary in that direction , will appear as a vertical stripe in these calculations . </S>",
    "<S> other possible groundstates of the thermodynamic t - j model , such as diagonal stripes or antiferromagnetic bubbles , are not permitted by construction . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that in the phase separated region , the holes are attracted to the open boundary of the finite system . on the other hand , in the striped regime </S>",
    "<S> , the holes are repelled by the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> thus the open boundary may well have a significant effect on the nature of the ground state that we observe , and especially , on the critical value of @xmath58 that separates stripe formation from phase separation .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that stripe formation always implies the presence of antiphase boundaries , i.e. , antiphase domain walls in the antiferromagnet . in all approaches , </S>",
    "<S> antiphase boundaries are always found in conjunction with stripes : from a simple mean - field calculations ( zaanen and gunnarsson 1989 ) to the more sophisticated quantum numerical approaches ( white and scalapino 1998 ; morais - smith _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ 1998 ; pryadko _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ 1999 ; martin _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ 2000 ) . from our numerical data </S>",
    "<S> we can not conclude that the antiphase boundaries are a consequence of stripes or vice - versa . </S>",
    "<S> what we are certain of is that the presence of the antiphase boundaries is a clear evidence of stripe existence . </S>",
    "<S> this favours our earlier observation that stripes are different from phase separation .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting explanation of the antiphase boundaries was suggested by nagaev ( 1995 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this brings us back to the general theory of metal - insulator transition , as formulated by mott ( 1984 ) , who pointed out that the number of free carriers should jump discontinuously at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> hence , there has to be a region of phase separation near the metal insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of phase separation associated with doping away from an antiferromagnetic phase was recognized prior to the discovery of high temperature superconductors ( visscher 1974 ; nagaev 1983 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> nagaev refers to this phase as _ nanoscale _ phase separation ( nagaev 1995 ; markiewicz 1997 ) , where phase separation is accompanied by charge separation , which in a perfect isotropic crystal , form an almost periodic structure ( nagaev 1995 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a nanoscale phase separation is realized as a form of charge density wave . in this language </S>",
    "<S> the antiphase boundaries appear as the ferromagnetic droplets ( nagaev 1983 , 1995 ) : a hole can delocalize over a finite domain by flipping the spins of the neighbouring cu ion , forming a small ferromagnetic - ferron ( nagaev 1983 , 1995 ) islands . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that if this is the origin of the antiphase boundaries then a second hole can lower its energy by localizing on the same ferron island , i.e. , on the same antiphase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this has the appearance of a real space pairing mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> hence , looking at the stripes as being a nanoscale phase separation , the antiphase boundaries ( periodic ferrons ) will appear as a consequence of the periodic hole structure ( stripes ) . at mean - field level </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by recalling that the superposition ( coexistence ) of a charge and spin density - wave will always gives rise to ferromagnetism ( volkov , kopaev and rusianov 1973 ; gulacsi and gulacsi 1986 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> work in australia was supported by the australian research council . </S>",
