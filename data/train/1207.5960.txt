    "consider a single - index varying - coefficient model of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a vector of covariates , @xmath2 is the response variable , @xmath3 is an @xmath4 vector of unknown parameters , @xmath5 is an @xmath6 vector of unknown functions and  @xmath7 is a random error with mean 0 and finite variance @xmath8 .",
    "assume that @xmath7 and @xmath9 are independent .",
    "for the sake of identifiability , it is often assumed that @xmath10 , and the first non - zero element is positive , where @xmath11 denotes the euclidean metric .    model ( [ eq1.1 ] ) includes a class of important statistical models .",
    "for example , if @xmath12 and @xmath13 , ( [ eq1.1 ] ) reduces to the single - index model ( see , e.g. , hrdle , hall and ichimura  @xcite , weisberg and welsh @xcite , zhu and fang @xcite , chiou and mller @xcite , hristache , juditsky and spokoiny @xcite , xue and zhu @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath14 and @xmath15 , ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is the varying - coefficient model ( see , e.g. , chen and tsay @xcite , hastie and tibshirani @xcite , wu , chiang and hoover  @xcite , fan and zhang  @xcite , cai , fan and li @xcite , cai , fan and yao @xcite , xue and zhu @xcite ) .",
    "if the last component of @xmath3 to be non - zero and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the remaining vector of @xmath18 with its @xmath19th component deleted , ( [ eq1.1 ] ) becomes the adaptive varying - coefficient linear model ( see , e.g. , fan , yao and cai @xcite , lu , tjstheim and yao  @xcite ) .",
    "model ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is easily interpreted in real applications because it has the features of the single - index model and the varying - coefficient model .",
    "in addition , model ( [ eq1.1 ] ) may include cross - product terms of some components of @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "hence it has considerable flexibility to cater for complex multivariate nonlinear structure .",
    "xia and li @xcite investigated a class of single - index coefficient regression models , which include model ( [ eq1.1 ] ) as a  special example .",
    "when it is used as a  nonparametric time series model , xia and li @xcite obtained the estimator of @xmath21 by kernel smoothing and then derived the estimator of @xmath3 by the least squares method and proved that the corresponding estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal .    in this paper , we develop statistical inference techniques of @xmath22 and @xmath3 with independent observations of @xmath23 .",
    "we can construct an empirical likelihood ratio function for @xmath3 by assuming @xmath5 and its derivative to be known functions . in practice , however , they are unknown , and hence the empirical likelihood ratio function can not be used to make inference on @xmath24 .",
    "this motivates us to estimate the unknown @xmath5 and @xmath25 via the local linear smoother , and then obtain an estimated empirical likelihood ratio of @xmath3 .",
    "the estimated empirical log - likelihood ratio is asymptotically distributed as a weighted sum of independent @xmath26 variables with unknown weights .",
    "this result can not be applied directly to construct confidence region for @xmath3 . to solve this issue ,",
    "two methods may be used ( see wang and rao @xcite ) .",
    "the first method is to estimate the unknown weights consistently so that the distribution of the estimated weighted sum of chi - squared variables can be estimated from the data .",
    "the second method is to adjust the estimated empirical log - likelihood ratio so that the resulting adjusted empirical log - likelihood ratio is asymptotically chi - squared .",
    "also , we obtain a maximum empirical likelihood estimator of @xmath3 , by maximizing the estimated empirical likelihood ratio function , and investigate its asymptotic property .",
    "in addition , we obtain the convergence rate of the estimator of  @xmath8 and define the consistent estimator of asymptotic variance ; this allows us to construct a  confidence region for @xmath3 .    comparing with the existing methods , our estimating method has the following advantage : the asymptotic variance of our estimator for @xmath3 is the same as those of hrdle _ et al .",

    "_ @xcite and xia and li @xcite .",
    "the difference between the proposed estimating approaches and the existing estimating approaches is that we use an empirical likelihood ratio to define the estimator of @xmath3 while the existing work uses the least squares techniques ( see , e.g. , hrdle _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , xia and li @xcite ) . also , we develop an empirical likelihood inference for constructing a confidence region of @xmath24 . the empirical likelihood method , introduced by owen @xcite , has many advantages for constructing confidence regions or intervals .",
    "for example , it does not impose prior constraints on region shape , and it does not require the construction of a pivotal quantity .",
    "the empirical likelihood has been studied by many authors .",

    ", we define an estimated empirical likelihood ratio , and then obtain a maximum empirical likelihood estimator of  @xmath3 by maximizing the empirical likelihood ratio function ; the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are also investigated . in section  [ sec3 ] , we define an adjusted empirical log - likelihood and derive its asymptotic distribution .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] reports a simulation study .",
    "proofs of theorems are relegated to the .",
    "it should be pointed that some special techniques are used in the proofs .",
    "suppose that @xmath27 is an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) sample from ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , that is @xmath28 where @xmath29s are i.i.d . random errors with mean 0 and finite variance @xmath8 .",
    "assume that @xmath30 are independent of @xmath31 .    to construct an empirical likelihood ratio function for @xmath3",
    ", we introduce an auxiliary random vector @xmath32 where @xmath25 stands for the derivative of the function vector @xmath5 , and @xmath33 is a bounded weight function with a bounded support @xmath34 , which is introduced to control the boundary effect in the estimations of @xmath22 and @xmath25 . to convenience ,",
    "we take that @xmath33 is the indicator function of the set @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath35 if @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the problem of testing whether @xmath24 is the true parameter is equivalent to testing whether @xmath35 for @xmath37 . by owen @xcite ,",
    "this can be done by using the empirical likelihood .",
    "that is , we can define the profile empirical likelihood ratio function @xmath38 it can be shown that @xmath39 is asymptotically chi - squared with @xmath19 degrees of freedom .",
    "however , @xmath40 can not be directly used to make statistical inference on @xmath3 because @xmath40 contains the unknowns @xmath5 and @xmath25 .",
    "a natural way is to replace @xmath41 and @xmath25 in @xmath42 by their estimators and define an estimated empirical likelihood function . in this paper",
    ", we estimate the vector functions @xmath5 and @xmath43 via the local linear regression technique ( see , e.g. , fan and gijbels @xcite ) .",
    "the local linear estimators for @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined as @xmath46 and @xmath47 at the fixed point @xmath3 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 minimize the sum of weighted squares @xmath50 ^ 2k_h(\\beta_0^tx_i - u),\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a kernel function , and @xmath53 is a bandwidth sequence that decreases to 0 as @xmath54 increases to @xmath55 .",
    "it follows from the least squares theory that @xmath56 where @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 since the convergence rate of the estimator of @xmath60 is slower than that of the estimator of @xmath61 if the same bandwidth is used , this leads to a slower convergence rate for the estimator @xmath62 of @xmath3 than @xmath63 . to increase the convergence rate of the estimator of @xmath60",
    ", we introduce the another bandwidth @xmath64 to replace @xmath65 in @xmath66 , and define as @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 replaced by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , for @xmath74 .",
    "then an estimated empirical likelihood ratio function is defined by @xmath75 by the lagrange multiplier method , @xmath76 can be represented as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is determined by @xmath79    let @xmath80 , and the first non - zero element is positive .",
    "then @xmath3 is an inner point of the set @xmath81 .",
    "therefore we need only search for @xmath3 over @xmath81 .",
    "a maximum empirical likelihood estimator for @xmath3 is given by @xmath82 with @xmath83 , we define the estimate of @xmath84 by @xmath85 and the estimate of @xmath8 by @xmath86    it is well known that if @xmath24 is known , the optimal bandwidth @xmath65 for @xmath87 is of order @xmath88 . however , if @xmath24 is unknown , in order to ensure that the estimator @xmath83 is root-@xmath54 consistent , the bandwidth @xmath65 should be smaller than @xmath88 , if we only assume @xmath21 are second - order differentiable ( see theorem  [ theo2 ] below ) .",

    ". conditions ( c6 ) and ( c7 ) ensure that the asymptotic variance for the estimator of @xmath3 exists .    let @xmath113 for some positive constant @xmath114 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that , since we anticipate that @xmath83 is root-@xmath54 consistent , we should look for a  maximum of @xmath115 which involves @xmath24 distant from @xmath3 by order @xmath116 .",
    "similar restrictions were also made by hrdle , hall and ichimura @xcite , xia and li @xcite and wang and xue  @xcite .",
