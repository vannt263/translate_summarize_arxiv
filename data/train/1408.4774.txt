    "at the turn of the last century observations from ia supernova and cosmic microwave background ( cmb)radiation confirmed that our universe is suffering from an accelerated expansion @xcite , but the physical origin of this acceleration is yet to be known .",
    "the standard explanation invokes an unknown `` dark energy '' component which has the property that positive energy density and negative pressure .",
    "observations indicate that dark energy occupies about 70% of the total energy of the universe , and the contribution of dark matter is @xmath0 26% .",
    "this accelerated expansion of the universe has also been strongly confirmed by some other independent experiments like sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) @xcite , wmap data analysis @xcite etc . over the past decade",
    "there have been many theoretical models for mimicking the dark energy behaviors , such as the simplest ( just ) cosmological constant in which the equation of state is independent of the cosmic time and which can fit the observations well .",
    "this model is the so - called @xmath1cdm , containing a mixture of cosmological constant @xmath1 and cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "however , two problems arise from this scenario , namely `` fine - tuning '' and the `` cosmic coincidence '' problems . in order to solve these two problems ,",
    "many dynamical dark energy models were suggested , whose equation of state evolves with cosmic time . the scalar field or quintessence",
    "@xcite is one of the most favored candidate of dark energy which produce sufficient negative pressure to drive acceleration . in order to alleviate the cosmological - constant problems and explain the acceleration expansion ,",
    "many dynamical dark energy models have been proposed , such as k - essence , tachyon , phantom , quintom , chaplygin gas model , etc @xcite . also the interacting dark energy models including modified chaplygin gas @xcite , holographic dark energy model @xcite , and braneworld model @xcite have been proposed .",
    "the equation of state of modified chaplygin gas is given by ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the pressure and energy density and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are positive constants . in einstein s gravity ,",
    "the modified chaplygin gas @xcite best fits with the 3 year wmap and the sdss data with the choice of parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite which are improved constraints than the previous ones @xmath10 @xcite . +",
    "another possibility is that general relativity is only accurate on small scales and has to be modified on cosmological distances .",
    "one of these is modified gravity theories . in this case cosmic acceleration",
    "would arise not from dark energy as a substance but from the geometry of space - time i.e. from the dynamics of modified gravity .",
    "modified gravity constitutes an interesting dynamical alternative to @xmath1cdm cosmology in that it is also able to describe the current cosmic acceleration .",
    "the simplest modified gravity is dgp brane - world model @xcite .",
    "the other alternative approach dealing with the acceleration problem of the universe is changing the gravity law through the modification of action of gravity by means of using @xmath11 gravity @xcite instead of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "some of these models , such as @xmath12 and logarithmic models , provide an acceleration for the universe at the present time @xcite .",
    "other modified gravity includes @xmath13 gravity , @xmath14 gravity , gauss - bonnet gravity , horava - lifshitz gravity , brans - dicke gravity , etc @xcite . in recent times",
    "there have been a lot of research on the background dynamics of different de models in modified gravity theories in the quest of a standard model of cosmology @xcite .",
    "+ in the present work , we concentrate on the generalized einstein - aether ( ea ) theories as proposed by zlosnik et al @xcite , which is a generalization of the einstein - aether theory developed by jacobson et al @xcite . in recent years",
    "a lot of work has been done in generalized einstein - aether theories @xcite . in the generalized einstein - aether theories by taking a special form of the lagrangian density of aether field",
    ", the possibility of einstein - aether theory as an alternative to dark energy model is discussed in detail , that is , taking a special aether field as a dark energy candidate and it has been found the constraints from observational data @xcite . since modified gravity theory may be treated as alternative to dark energy , so meng et al @xcite have not taken by hand any types of dark energy in einstein - aether gravity and shown that the gravity may be generates dark energy . here",
    "if we exempt this assumption , so we need to consider the dark energy from outside .",
    "so we assume the frw universe in einstein - aether gravity model filled with the dark matter and the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) type dark energy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 comprises of the general concepts of einstein - aether gravity . in section 3",
    ", we do an extensive study of the dynamical system . in section 4 ,",
    "a detailed graphical analysis for the phase plane is presented .",
    "finally the paper ends with some concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "in order to include lorentz symmetry violating terms in gravitation theories , apart from some noncommutative gravity models , one may consider existence of preferred frames .",
    "this can be achieved admitting a unit timelike vector field in addition to the metric tensor of spacetime .",
    "such a timelike vector implies a preferred direction at each point of spacetime . here the unit timelike vector field is called the _ aether _ and the theory coupling the metric and unit timelike vector is called the _ einstein - aether _ theory @xcite .",
    "so einstein - aether theory is the extension of general relativity ( gr ) that incorporates a dynamical unit timelike vector field ( i.e. , aether ) . in the last decade",
    "there is an increasing interest in the aether theory .",
    "+ the action of the einstein - aether gravity theory with the normal einstein - hilbert part action can be written in the form @xcite @xmath15\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the vector field lagrangian density while @xmath17 denotes the lagrangian density for all other matter fields .",
    "the lagrangian density for the vector part consists of terms quadratic in the field @xcite :    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21 are dimensionless constants , @xmath22 is the coupling constant which has the dimension of mass , @xmath23 is a lagrange multiplier that enforces the unit constraint for the time - like vector field , @xmath24 is a contravariant vector , @xmath25 is metric tensor and @xmath26 ia an arbitrary function of @xmath27 . from ( 1 ) , we get the field equations @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the energy momentum tensor for matter field and @xmath32 is the energy momentum tensor for the vector field and they are respectively given as follows : @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath4 and @xmath3 are respectively the energy density and pressure of matter and @xmath34 is the fluid 4-velocity vector and @xmath35-y_{(ab)}f'+\\frac{1}{2}~g_{ab}m^{2}f+\\lambda a_{a}a_{b}\\ ] ] with @xmath36\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath37 means symmetric with respect to the indices involved and * the vector @xmath24 is considered to have time - like direction and satisfies @xmath38 to fix the variation of the action with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "the normalized vector field @xmath24 has components @xmath39 in the frw cosmology with homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with perfect fluid . *",
    "we consider the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric of the universe as @xmath40\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the curvature scalar and @xmath42 is the scale factor . from equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath43 where @xmath44 is constant . from eq . ( 5 ) , we get the modified friedmann equation for einstein - aether gravity as in the following @xcite : @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is hubble parameter .",
    "now we see that if the first expressions of l.h.s . of equations",
    "* ( 14 ) * and * ( 15 ) * are zero , we get the usual field equations for einstein s gravity . so first expressions arise for einstein - aether gravity .",
    "also the conservation equation is given by @xmath48    now , assume that the matter fluid is combination of dark matter and modified chaplygin gas type dark energy .",
    "so @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are respectively the energy density and pressure of dark matter and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively the energy density and pressure of modified chaplygin gas .",
    "assume that the dark matter follows the barotropic equation of state @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a constant .",
    "the equation of state of modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) is given by @xcite @xmath57    where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "as in the present problem the interaction between de and pressureless dm has been taken into account for interacting de and dm the energy balance equation will be @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the interaction term , @xmath64 is the coupling parameter ( or transfer strength ) and @xmath65 is the total cosmic energy density which satisfies the energy conservation equation @xmath66 @xcite .    since we lack information about the fact , how does de and dm interact so we are not able to estimate the interaction term from the first principles .",
    "however , the negativity of @xmath67 immediately implies the possibility of having negative de in the early universe which is overruled by the necessity of the second law of thermodynamics to be held @xcite",
    ". hence @xmath67 must be positive and small . from the observational data of 182 gold type ia supernova samples , cmb data from the three year wmap survey and the baryonic acoustic oscillations from the sloan digital sky survey , it is estimated that the coupling parameter between dm and de must be a small positive value ( of the order of unity ) , which satisfies the requirement for solving the cosmic coincidence problem and the second law of thermodynamics @xcite . due to the underlying interaction , the beginning of the accelerated expansion",
    "is shifted to higher redshifts .",
    "the continuity equations for dark energy and dark matter are given in equations ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) .",
    "now we proceed to study the dynamical system .      in this subsection",
    "we plan to analyze the dynamical system .",
    "for that firstly we convert the physical parameters into some dimensionless form , given by @xmath68 where the present value of the scale factor @xmath69 is assumed .    * following the works of zlosnik et al and zuntz et al @xcite , we assume the ansatz for @xmath70 as * @xmath71 * where cosmic acceleration is realized for @xmath72 and for certain value of n @xmath73 without the need of a source term in the modified einstein equations @xcite , here modelled with the chaplygin gas . this form is efficient enough to express a wide range of behaviour .",
    "following modified newtonian dynamics , if we use the same branch of @xmath70 as it uses on small scales , it can be shown that the background cosmology becomes inconsistent with the late time cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "hence we use a reasonable form for @xmath70 given in eqn .",
    "( 27 ) , which works for the accelerated regime ( @xmath74 ) . using this form of @xmath70 ,",
    "the modified friedmann equations become , * @xmath75h^{2}=\\frac{8\\pi g}{3}\\rho\\ ] ] * where @xmath76 .",
    "moreover the expression for @xmath77 is obtained as , * @xmath78 * where @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the present value of hubble constant*.    * let us consider some special cases of @xmath81 .",
    "we see that if @xmath82 , the friedmann equations are unchanged ( @xmath83 ) , and invariably there is no effect on the background cosmology .",
    "if @xmath84 , the cosmological constant is recovered .",
    "when @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 and there is a change of scale for the newton s constant by a factor of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "a schematic representation of the late time evolution of the universe depending on the value of @xmath81 can be found in @xcite . from the above discussion the most suitable choice of @xmath81 for our present assignment",
    "is @xmath85 .",
    "moreover it provides a bit of mathematical simplicity as well .",
    "this value of @xmath81 completely lies in the accepted region which is @xmath88 .",
    "as apparently conceived , this chosen value of @xmath81 does not actually hamper the generality of the problem .",
    "in fact from our analysis we have seen that a slight variation in the value of @xmath81 does not bring about significant alterations to the final result . *    using eqns .",
    "( 13 - 19 ) into eqn.(20 ) we get the parameter gradients as    @xmath89    @xmath90    and    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the eos parameter for mcg determined as @xmath93    @xmath94\\ ] ]    here @xmath95 is given by , @xmath96      the critical points of the above system are obtained by putting @xmath97 .",
    "but due to the complexity of these equations , it is not possible to find a solution in terms of all the involved parameters .",
    "* so we are compelled to search for a viable numerical solution . in order to accomplish this",
    ", we have to replace the parameters by suitable numerical values which must be realistic cosmologically .",
    "as far as the parameters of mcg are concerned , we will be using the values which are consistent with the observational data @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath98 .",
    "the choice of the aether gravity parameters will not be so straightforward , since we do not have cosmologically constrained parametric values at our disposal . in @xcite",
    "clifton et al has shown that in order to realize a more exotic but viable scenario , one should have @xmath99 . from eqn.(23 ) , we get an idea of the value of @xmath100 . if we take @xmath101 ( acceptable value from the latest observational data ) and @xmath85 , we see that in order to make @xmath102 , @xmath100 should be restricted to negative values .",
    "although we get an idea about the sign of @xmath100 yet there is no information available in literature about the magnitude .",
    "so keeping in mind the simplicity of calculations , we choose @xmath103 . using the accepted values of parameters in eqn.(23 )",

    "this is perfectly consistent with an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "sahni et al ( 2003 ) @xcite introduced a pair of cosmological diagnostic pair @xmath181 which is known as as statefinder parameters .",

    "dynamical system analysis was carried out , critical points were found and the stability of the system around those critical points was tested . graphical analysis was done to get an explicit picture of the outcome of the work . in order to find a solution for the cosmic coincidence problem ,",
    "a suitable interaction between de and dm was considered .",
