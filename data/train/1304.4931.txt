    "the nature of these is among the most challenging problems of modern physics .",
    "while dark energy is generally assumed to be a non - vanishing vacuum energy represented by a cosmological constant @xmath0 in einstein s equations , the currently most favored dark matter candidates are neutral fermionic particles , which condensed from the thermal bath of the early universe @xcite , known as `` cold dark matter '' ( cdm ) particles .    on galaxy scales , predictions of this concordance cosmological model ( @xmath0cdm )",

    "dynamics without dark matter for sequence  1 . as we can see , the velocities at radii larger than approximately 6kpc are larger in the polar plane .",
    "the reason for this is that the closed orbits are much more eccentric in the host galaxy than in the plane of the polar ring due to the compact host galaxy and the extended ring ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] ) , and when observing the polar ring galaxy edge - on , the minimum velocities of these eccentric orbits ( point a in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] ) are measured .",
    "the eccentricity can be explained as follows .",
    "the potential due to the compact host galaxy component appears nearly spherical at large radii for test particles in both the plane of the host galaxy and the plane of the polar ring .",
    "the potential generated by the extended polar ring , however , does appear spherical to particles orbiting within the ring , but not to particles orbiting in the host plane .",
    "this gives rise to lower line - of - sight velocities when the host disk and polar rings are seen edge - on .    at radii smaller than the size of the hole ( the region where the density increases with radius )",
    ", the eccentricity argument turns around .",
    "the test particles are near the center of the galaxy and accordingly near the center of the hole of the polar ring . at these radii",
    ", all test particles experience the gravitational field caused by the polar ring rather spherically , while the potential by the galactic disk appears spherical only to the test objects orbiting within the disk , not to those moving in the polar plane .",
    "the transition appears around approximately 6kpc , i.e. between the radial size of the galactic disk , which is smaller than 6kpc , and that of the polar ring , which is larger than 6kpc .",
    "this ellipticity of the orbits in the host is enhanced by the actual presence of the hole at the center of the polar ring , because , in order to have the same mass in the polar structure as in a corresponding disk , one needs to increase the density at large @xmath34 in the polar plane , making it more extended ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ringmodel ] ) .      in milgromian dynamics , all investigated models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplot ] ) that ( i ) feature a polar ring ( i.e. sequences  1 , 2 , 4 , 5 and 6 ) , that ( ii ) has a total mass ( i.e. gaseous plus stellar mass ) comparable to the mass of the host galaxy ( within a factor of @xmath842 ) , show higher velocities in the polar plane at radii larger than approximately 6kpc .",
    "indeed , the reason is the same as in newtonian dynamics without dark matter , and is even boosted by the additional gravity provided by milgromian dynamics . because the host is more compact than the ring , it appears more spherical to particles orbiting in the ring at large radii than the ring appears to particle orbiting in the host at the same radii .",
    "hence , also in milgromian dynamics , the closed orbits are in the galactic disk more eccentric than in the plane of the polar ring .",
    "this gives rise to lower line of sight velocities in the host for typical observed systems where the host and polar rings are seen approximately edge - on . because milgromian dynamics adds a disk component of pdm to the host and to the ring ( see fig.[fig : phantom ] ) ,",
    "this effect is even amplified compared to newtonian dynamics .    in sequence  1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplot ] , 1st column ) , one can see that decreasing the polar ring mass compared to the host gradually cancels the above effect , because the gravity generated by the polar ring becomes more and more negligible when decreasing its mass . for the benchmark model , at a radius of less than approximately 6kpc , test stars orbiting in the polar ring have smaller velocities than those at the same radius in the host disk , because they are close to or in the polar hole and the mass enclosed by their orbits is comparably small .",
    "this transition radius changes to larger radii when decreasing the polar ring mass , to gradually arrive at the situation of no polar ring , where polar orbits have velocities systematically lower than those in the disk ( equal at large radii ) .    the same effect is observed in sequence  2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplot ] , second column ) for more massive systems .",
    "note that the velocities in the host decrease with declining polar ring mass , due to the decreasing gravity of the polar ring , but less so than the velocities in the ring .",
    "the reason for this slower decrease is that the effect of decreased gravity is compensated by the effect of decreasing eccentricity for particles orbiting in the host .    on the other hand , in sequence  3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplot ] , 3rd column ) , the rotation velocities are , at radii larger than 15kpc , very similar in both planes , because of the special symmetry of these models .",
    "this emphasizes the role played by the hole at the center of the ring in the other sequences .    varying the form and size of the stellar and gaseous holes in the polar ring in sequence  4 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : multiplot ] , 4th column ) shows that for a host and ring of comparable mass , the effect is quite generic in the presence of a hole .",

    "<S> polar ring galaxies are ideal objects with which to study the three - dimensional shapes of galactic gravitational potentials since two rotation curves can be measured in two perpendicular planes . </S>",
    "<S> observational studies have uncovered systematically larger rotation velocities in the extended polar rings than in the associated host galaxies . in the dark matter context , this can only be explained through dark halos that are systematically flattened along the polar rings . </S>",
    "<S> here , we point out that these objects can also be used as very effective tests of gravity theories , such as those based on milgromian dynamics ( mond ) . </S>",
    "<S> we run a set of polar ring models using both milgromian and newtonian dynamics to predict the expected shapes of the rotation curves in both planes , varying the total mass of the system , the mass of the ring with respect to the host , as well as the size of the hole at the center of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> we find that milgromian dynamics not only naturally leads to rotation velocities being typically higher in the extended polar rings than in the hosts , as would be the case in newtonian dynamics without dark matter , but that it also gets the shape and amplitude of velocities correct . </S>",
    "<S> milgromian dynamics thus adequately explains this particular property of polar ring galaxies . </S>"
