    "+ overall the bulk of the methanol maser emission , both in terms of flux and number of components , is associated with w51 main .",
    "only two weak , isolated components are seen in w51  south , most likely associated with the e3 and e8 sources . although the work of fish & reid ( 2007 ) shows that there is significant ground state oh emission from both main and south , with indeed the brightest oh component being in south , excited oh emission is only detected towards main .    as noted by etoka et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in the case of the sfr w3(oh ) , the present astrometric study towards w51  main / south confirms that associations of individual oh and methanol maser components are rare .",
    "despite all the components identified in the rich maser environment of w51  main , no methanol and oh maser component overlap is found .",
    "the minimal separation between a ground - state oh and a methanol component is 27  mas ( @xmath43  au ) , rising to 60  mas ( @xmath44  au ) between an excited oh and a methanol component .",

    "based on the present oh modelling results , and those of gray et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and cragg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the total absence of 6.035-ghz emission and the scarcity of 1.720  ghz emission in w51  south , is suggestive of a lower density in w51  south than in w51  main . + the physical conditions under which 6.668-ghz methanol masers ( and 12.2-ghz methanol masers ) form appears to be very similar to those that support the oh masers in almost all respects ( cragg , sobolev & godfrey 2005 ) .",
    "in particular , maser optical depths are rather insensitive to the dust temperature provided the criterion @xmath45 is met , and they decay with increasing @xmath46 for a given dust temperature .",
    "overall gas density also appears unable to differentiate between the oh and methanol pumping regions .    the parameter that does appear to distinguish the methanol inversion region in parameter space from that of oh is the specific column density ( cragg et al . 2005 ) , that is the number density of the active molecule divided by the velocity gradient in the medium .",
    "although this model can not be applied to the middle row of figure  [ fig : oh modelling outcome ] , it can be computed for the other two rows , where the velocity gradient is @xmath47s@xmath2 . for conditions that strongly favour 1.7-ghz to 6.0-ghz oh masers ,",
    "we are restricted to number densities of oh below @xmath110@xmath48 , or to specific column densities of less than @xmath49s@xmath48 .",
    "the models in cragg et al . require specific optical depths of methanol that are typically a factor of ten larger .",

    "studies of the 6-ghz excited - state oh and 6.668-ghz methanol maser emission with similar astrometric accuracy to those presented here have also been performed towards the sfr complexes w3(oh ) ( etoka et al . 2005 ) and on1 ( green et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the results in on1 are remarkably similar to w51 .",
    "in particular , in on1 there is no association between 6-ghz excited - state oh and methanol masers with the closest components of each species being separated by @xmath123  mas . in addition , the 6-ghz excited - state oh and methanol masers form a linear distribution . however",
    "this structure is systematically offset ( by @xmath160 - 70  mas ) from another linear distribution traced by ground - state oh masers .",
    "this offset could result from the proper motions of the masers in the 9 years between the observations of the ground - state oh ( nammahachak et al . 2006 ) and the methanol and 6-ghz excited - state oh . nonetheless , this filamentary distribution is strikingly reminiscent of that observed here in the south - southwest part of w51 main .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field measured in on1 is similar in strength to that in w51 .",
    "these similarities suggest a similar mechanism / environment is observed in both sfr complexes .",
    "+ in contrast , the maser distribution in w3(oh ) is quite different from w51 or on1 .",
    "even though long filamentary structures are observed , the most striking one being the large - extended filament traced both by 6.668-ghz methanol and 4.765-ghz excited - oh maser emission ( harvey - smith & cohen 2006 ) , there is no clear apparent pattern nor segregation of the different species in the area probed by the maser components .",
    "we have presented merlin astrometric observations towards w51  main and south of the class  ii methanol maser emission at 6.668  ghz and the excited oh maser emission at 6.035  ghz .",
    "the 6-ghz maser distributions have been aligned with those of the ground - state oh maser transitions at 1.665 , 1.667 and 1.720  ghz from fish & reid ( 2007 ) .",
    "although main and south have similar number of oh ground - state maser components with the strongest component in south , the bulk of the methanol 6.668  ghz maser emission , and all of the excited oh 6.035  ghz maser emission are found to be associated with e2 in w51  main .",
    "only two faint methanol maser spots are found in w51  south , probably associated with e3 and e8 .",
    "modelling implies n(h@xmath12)@xmath76@xmath48 , a dust temperature 30  k@xmath77  t@xmath78130  k and a kinetic temperature t@xmath79t@xmath39 as reasonable physical conditions for main with a possibly lower density for south .    at this high spatial resolution ( better than 15  mas )",
    ", no overlapping of oh and methanol maser spots or 6.035-ghz excited - oh and ground - state oh maser components are found even in the most crowded areas .",
    "the alignment of the 18-cm ground - state masers and the 5-cm methanol and excited oh masers also reveal that the extreme velocity main - line masers found @xmath60400  mas north and south of e2-e ( either side of the methanol ring - like struture ) are associated with the well - known outflow observed in co by shi et al .",
    "( 2010b ) .",
    "the masers in the south - southwest region of w51  main clearly exhibit a filamentary structure .",
    "those filaments extend west or southwest and point back towards e2-e .",
    "there are 2 prominent filaments , one of which contains the bulk of the 6.035-ghz maser spots , located at the southwest edge of the methanol maser spots and extended by 1.720-ghz maser spots . the magnetic strength and direction inferred from the excited oh maser emission at 6.035  ghz is in agreement with former measurements in the region .",
    "also , our measured polarisation angle is in agreement with bima 1.3-mm observations , interpreted by tang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) as the signature of an hourglass magnetic field structure suggesting that the maser spots trace the magnetic field lines .",
    "a close inspection of the methanol masers revealed a wide - opening angle structure centred on e2-e , roughly aligned on a p.a.@xmath80 , that is roughly perpendicular to the co outflow , and showing a clear velocity coherence .",
    "we estimated that the mass in this structure is between 22.5 and 90  m@xmath9 .",
    "the two possible interpretations of this structure are the signature of * ( 1 ) * an outflow showing episodic events of @xmath81  yr for the older event and @xmath82  yr for the younger one , assuming an outflow velocity of @xmath83  km  s@xmath2 or ; * ( 2 ) * an accretion flow in which two physical components are present : an infalling anvelope with the central ring - like structure probing a compact and dense disk or torus around the central object .",
    "although e2-w is the only continuum source in w51e2 clearly associated with a uchii region , currently e2-e seems to be the most active source in the region .",
    "the presence of methanol masers and the lack of a uchii region point at a massive central object at an early stage of the star forming process .",
    "the work presented here is based on observations obtained with merlin , a national facility operated by the university of manchester at jodrell bank observatory , on behalf of stfc.computations were carried out using legion supercomputer , ulc .",
