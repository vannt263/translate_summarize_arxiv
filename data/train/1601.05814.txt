    "similarly , observational evidence @xcite also indicates that the population of hjs is unlikely to be explained by a single migration mechanism .",
    "the occurrence rate of hjs produced by lk migration in stellar binaries can be computed via @xmath9 where @xmath10 is fraction of stars having a wide binary companion , @xmath11 is the fraction of solar - type stars hosting a `` regular '' giant planet at a distance of a few au , and @xmath12 is the formation fraction / efficiency of hjs ( i.e. , the fraction of systems that result in hjs for a given distributions of binaries and `` regular '' planets ) .",

    "@xcite ( hereafter asl ) conducted a comprehensive population synthesis study of hj formation from lk oscillations in stellar binaries , including all relevant physical effects ( the octupole potential from the binary companion , mutual precession of the host stellar spin axis and planet orbital axis , tidal dissipation , and stellar spin - down due to magnetic braking ) . unlike previous works , asl considered a range of planet masses ( @xmath18 ) and initial semi - major axes ( @xmath19  au ) , different properties for the host star , and varying tidal dissipation strengths .",
    "they found that the hj formation efficiency depends strongly on planet mass and stellar type , with @xmath20 ( depending on tidal dissipation strength ) for @xmath21 , and larger ( up to @xmath22 ) for more massive planets .",
    "the production efficiency of `` hot saturns '' ( @xmath23 ) is much lower , because most migrating planets are tidally disrupted .",

    "this agreement confirms that the total migration fraction of planets ( the sum of hj and tidal disruption fractions ) via the lk mechanism is primarily determined by the initial geometry of the hierarchical triple , and depends weakly on the properties of the planet @xcite .",
    "the production fraction of close - in planets , on the other hand , does depend on the internal properties of the planet ( e.g. , mass - radius relation and the strength of dissipation ) , and it decreases with decreasing mass in the case of gas giants , resulting in a natural absence of  hot saturns \" .",
