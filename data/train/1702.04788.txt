    "redshifted  21-cm absorption can provide an excellent probe of the contents and nature of the early universe , through surveys which are not subject to the same flux and redshift constraints suffered by optical studies . for instance , measurement of the contribution of the neutral gas content to the mass density of the universe at redshifts ( @xmath5 ) , where the lyman-  transition is not accessible to ground - based optical telescopes .",
    "this corresponds to the past 10 gyr of cosmic history , which are of particular interest since this is when star formation was at its most vigorous and the stellar mass density in the universe increased by more than a factor of four @xcite .",
    "there is , however , mounting evidence that the star formation history is not best traced by _ intervening _ galaxies , detected in the lyman-   absorption of a background continuum source :    1 .   while the star formation history exhibits a strong evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) , the neutral gas content in damped lyman-@xmath6 absorption systems ( dlas )  .",
    "] , remains approximately constant with look - back time ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "very few dlas have been detected in lyman-  or h  emission @xcite , both tracers of star formation .",
    "the heavy element content of dlas does not appear to be caused by star formation within the absorbers themselves , but possibly deposited via winds from nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "4 .   the relative paucity of detections of  21-cm absorption in high redshift dlas appears to be dominated by extrinsic line - of - sight effects , rather than by any intrinsic evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in order to fully investigate any relation between the evolution of cold neutral gas and the star formation history , we should also quantify the population of sources in which the absorption is _ associated _ with the continuum source itself .",
    "the detection of  21-cm is of further interest as the comparison of its redshift with that of other transitions has the potential to measure past values of the fundamental constants of nature ( @xcite ) , which may exhibit a spatial @xcite , as well as a temporal @xcite variation .",
    "radio data can yield at least an order of magnitude in precision in the measurement of the constants over the optical data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the oh radical can not only provide measurements of various combinations of constants through comparison with optical ,  or rotational ( millimetre ) transitions , but inter - comparison of the hyperfine 18-cm transitions can remove the systematics introduced by the possible velocity offsets present between species @xcite .",
    "however , the number of redshifted oh absorption systems remains a paltry five , all of which are at a redshifts of @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to these , molecular absorption has also been detected in 25 dlas , through  vibrational transitions redshifted into the optical band at @xmath8 ( compiled in @xcite with the addition of @xcite ) . however , extensive millimetre - wave observations have yet to detect absorption from any rotational molecular transition ( e.g. @xcite ) , leading us to suspect that the choice of optically bright objects selects against dusty environments , which are more likely to harbour molecules in abundance .",
    "this is apparent when one compares the dlas in which h@xmath9 has been detected , which have molecular fractions @xmath10 and optical  near - infrared colours of @xmath11 @xcite , with the five known oh absorbers , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this is a strong indicator that the reddening is due to dust , which protects the molecular gas from the ambient ultra - violet radiation .    therefore by selecting very red objects , with colours of @xmath14",
    ", we may expect oh column densities which can be detected with current large radio telescopes .",
    "however , there exists an additional constraint when searching for absorption by gas in the hosts of radio galaxies and quasars  specifically , that neutral hydrogen has never been detected where the ultra - violet ( @xmath15   ) luminosity of the source exceeds @xmath1 .",
    "this `` critical '' luminosity applies to all redshifts for various heterogeneous ( unbiased ) samples , as seen through the non - detection of  21-cm absorption at @xmath16  by @xcite .",
    "this is interpreted as the flux limited optical spectroscopic surveys , which yield the redshift , selecting the most ultra - violet luminous objects at high redshift @xcite , where the corresponding ionising photon rates of @xmath17  sec@xmath3 are sufficient to ionise all of the neutral gas in a large spiral galaxy @xcite .",
    "in txs1954 + 513 , which they claim has an ultra - violet luminosity of @xmath18 .",
    "although unreliable , this luminosity is still consistent with the critical value ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : os ] ) . ]    at @xmath19 the vast majority of radio sources for which redshifts are available are believed to have luminosities above the critical value ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in order to increase the associated absorption statistics , we can select from the large population of radio sources of known redshift at @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "magnitudes are generally more available than the @xmath22 , as well as being given in the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample catalogue @xcite . ]",
    "this should yield uv luminosities below the critical @xmath1  in the 1400 mhz band ( @xmath23 , see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this magnitude selection also has the advantage of giving large blue  near - infrared colours , where we may expect @xmath24 for the five known oh absorbers , on the basis of their optical  near - infrared colours of @xmath25 @xcite .    from the first part of this survey",
    ", we @xcite obtained one detection from four targets , three of which were unaffected by rfi , following which we were awarded further observing time on the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) to complete the remainder of the requested sample . here we present our results and discuss their implications : in sect .",
    "[ obs ] we describe the sample selection , observations and analysis , in sect . [ sec : res ] we present our results , in sect .",
    "[ sec : disc ] we discuss these in context of the previous  21-cm searches and in sect .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in order to obtain a @xmath20 sample of  and oh absorbers , we selected sources for which both transitions would be redshifted into the 1420 mhz receiver band ( which spans 10001450 mhz ) . to ensure sufficient flux against which to detect the absorption ( sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] ) , sources were selected from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs , @xcite ) , giving a total of ten targets with redshifts of @xmath26 .",
    "lastly , the sources were prioritised by faintness , for which we chose @xmath27 ( as quoted in the phfs , table [ targets ] ) , since this gave the ten faintest targets for which the estimated flux density at the redshifted  21-cm absorption frequency , @xmath28 , was confirmed to exceed 0.5 jy .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ reasons ]    from these we see that , on an individual basis , the odds are against a detection with a maximum probability of 52% for a single parameter ( @xmath29 for 1509 + 022 and @xmath30 for 0240217 ) .",
    "this , however , will be tempered by the probability from the other parameters , which are not independent ( the uv luminosity ) and the @xmath31 colour , where @xmath32 will be anti - correlated with @xmath33 , particularly at @xmath34 . since the radio and uv luminosities are correlated @xcite , there will also be a relationship between @xmath29 and the search sensitivity . ] , making the overall probability difficult to ascertain for each source .",
    "so in addition to our hypothesis that we only expect detections where @xmath35 ( @xmath36  sec@xmath3 ) , detection rates may be maximised through the selection of red , gigahertz peaked spectrum sources .",
    "the colour is indicative of a dusty environment , more conducive to the presence of cold neutral gas , and the turnover frequency indicative of an increased covering factor , due to the compact radio emission .",
    "if the projected extent of the radio emission is dictated by the orientation of the jets along the sight - line , this presents an issue for the model where the absorption occurs in the obscuring torus invoked by unified schemes of active galactic nuclei ( e.g. @xcite ) , since this is less likely to intercept the sight - line in compact objects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , as well as occuring in outflowing gas ( e.g. @xcite ) , the bulk of the absorption is believed to occur in the large - scale galactic disk , rather than the sub - pc torus , which is expected to have a random orientation to the radio jets ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have undertaken a survey for associated  21-cm and oh 18-cm absorption in six @xmath0 radio sources with the gmrt . despite selecting targets which have ionising photon rates lower than the critical value , above which the neutral gas is believed to be completely ionised , and reaching the sensitivities of previous detections",
    ", we do not detect either transition .",
    "given that the oh absorption strength is expected to be @xmath37 times that of the  21-cm absorption @xcite , the non - detection of this radical is not surprising , especially in the knowledge that our targets are not as reddened as originally believed .",
    "regarding the , by combining our results with previous searches , in addition to the ionising photon rate ( uv luminosity ) , we find correlations between the detection rate and :    1 .",
    "the blue  near - infrared colour , which is indicative of the reddening being due to dust , the presence of which helps in maintaining a low gas spin temperature in the case of the detections .",
    "the turnover frequency of the radio sed of the source , which is believed to be anti - correlated with the size of the radio emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this itself is anti - correlated with the line strength , due to lower coverage of the measured flux , and so lower optical depths are expected for extended sources @xcite .",
    "the detection rate is , of course , also subject to the search sensitivity with a maximum rate of @xmath38% for @xmath39 .",
    "a maximum of @xmath40% may be expected , due to the orientation of the absorbing gas with respect to the continuum emission @xcite , and so in addition to maximising the sample size , future surveys should also target optically faint / obscured , radio bright objects . since this could preclude objects with measured optical redshifts , full band `` spectral scans '' towards sufficiently bright radio sources may be the way forward ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we confirm that associated  21-cm absorption has never been detected above the theoretical value of @xmath2  sec@xmath3 @xcite . from the highest reliable detected value of @xmath41  sec@xmath3 ( a monochromatic @xmath15    luminosity of @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the binomial probability of the observed 0 detections out of 29 searched above this value is just @xmath43 , which is significant at @xmath44 .",
    "adding , the forthcoming results of @xcite , the probability of the 0 detections out of 63 searches is just @xmath45 , which is significant at @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the case for a critical ultra - violet luminosity is strengthened .",
    "given the unbiased ( i.e. inhomogeneous ) nature of the whole sample , this @xmath1 ( @xmath2  sec@xmath3 ) appears to be universal and the selection of sources of known optical redshift leads to the selection of higher luminosities at high redshift ( see @xcite ) , where all of the gas is ionised .",
    "that is , even the square kilometre array will not detect  21-cm absorption in these .",
    "this leads us to reiterate that spectral scans towards optically faint objects is the best strategy and this is where the ska will excel due to its wide instantaneous bandwidth .",
