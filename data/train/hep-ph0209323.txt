    "the dual manifestation of the @xmath2 as a narrow resonance in nonflip amplitude @xmath3 and as a broad resonance in the flip amplitude @xmath4 is connected to symmetries of qcd . in this paper",

    "we suggest that the broad resonant @xmath1-wave structure in @xmath5 scattering associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is due to the interaction of the chirally invariant and narrow @xmath2 with the chirally noninvariant qcd vacuum in @xmath5 scattering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii .",
    "we use the most recent values of gluon condensate to show that ellis - lanik relation ( 1.5 ) selects the solutions @xmath6 and @xmath8 . in section iii .",
    "we show how weinberg s mended symmetry selects the solutions @xmath58 and @xmath7 and comment on the role of qcd vacuum in hadron reactions .",

    "the moduli of the @xmath1-wave transversity amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath1 measured in @xmath18 at 17.2 gev / c on polarized target are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the figure shows the two solutions for @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the results of simultaneous fits to the four solution combinations @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "two fits , a and b , give essentially identical curves , the same resonance parameters for @xmath38 and @xmath46 , and the same @xmath47@xcite .",
    "the transversity `` up '' amplitude @xmath42 clearly resonates below 800 mev while the transversity `` down '' amplitude @xmath43 shows a broader structure around 800 mev .    in table",
    "i we present the mass @xmath10 and the width @xmath61 of the @xmath16 resonance for the best fits in each solution combination .",
    "the measured width @xmath61 is the total width of the @xmath16 decays . to compare our results with the ellis - lanik relation ( 1.5 )",
    "we need partial width @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fraction of charged @xmath64 decays . as we shall see below",
    ", the partial width @xmath65 is small .",
    "we also assume that @xmath66 decays of @xmath16 are suppressed",
    ". then isospin conservation requires that @xmath67 . with this value of @xmath63",
    "we then calculate the value @xmath30 of the gluon condensate from ellis - lanik relation for each solution combination .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath30 were estimated originally by the itep group@xcite to be @xmath68 ( gev)@xmath69 or up to @xmath70 ( gev)@xmath69 in later calculations@xcite .",
    "more recent estimates are @xmath71 ( gev)@xmath69 @xcite and @xmath72 ( gev)@xmath69@xcite . the latest estimate@xcite based on analysis of the @xmath73 violating ratio @xmath74 is @xmath75 ( gev)@xmath69 . the most recent estimate based on charmonium sum rules@xcite gives a similar result @xmath76 ( gev)@xmath69 .",
    "this new itep value includes a contribution from @xmath77 condensate in dilute instanton model@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will use the average value of the two last results    @xmath78    the comparison of @xmath30 in ( 2.1 ) with the results for @xmath30 from ellis -lanik relation in table i shows the best agreement is for solution combinations @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "the ellis - lanik relation thus selects the solutions @xmath6 and @xmath8 and imparts the @xmath2 resonance with a dilaton - gluonium interpretation .",
    "we can now use the relation ( 1.6 ) to calculate the decay width @xmath79 .",
    "assuming @xmath80 and @xmath67 we obtain results shown in table i. we see that @xmath79 is too small for @xmath2 to be observed in @xmath81 decays .",
    "this result is in full agreement with the measurements of reactions @xmath82@xcite and @xmath83@xcite which found no evidence of resonance structure below @xmath46 .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 is not observed in these reactions strongly suggests a gluonium interpretation of this state since gluons do not couple directly to photons .",
    "these experiments support the ellis - lanik identification of the scalar dilaton field @xmath16 with a scalar gluonium which they based solely on the dominance of the scalar gluonic current @xmath27 by the field @xmath16@xcite .",
    "a theoretical support for the gluonium interpretation of @xmath2 comes from recent studies of qcd sum rules .",
    "it was shown by elias and collaborators in @xcite that qcd sum rules require that a scalar state with a mass below 800 mev has a narrow width .",
    "several analyses using qcd sum rules concluded that the scalar states with a mass below @xmath46 are non-@xmath84 states@xcite .",
    "the qcd sum rules are thus consistent with the identification of the narrow @xmath2 resonance with the lowest mass scalar gluonium .",
    "in 1990 , weinberg showed that even where a symmetry is spontaneously broken it can still be used to classify hadron states@xcite .",
    "such mended symmetry leads to a quartet of particles with definite mass relations and c - parity .",
    "he showed that @xmath51 , @xmath16 , @xmath85 and @xmath50 mesons corresponding to spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of strong interactions occupy the quartet .",
    "weinberg s mended symmetry predicts @xmath57 in agreement with our results for @xmath10 shown in table i.    central to weinberg s mended symmetry are current algebra and superconvergence sum rules for helicity amplitudes . in 1968 ,",
    "gilman and harari studied saturation of such sum rules in a framework of a linear sigma model@xcite .",
    "they found that @xmath57 and @xmath86 which gives @xmath87 mev . a broad resonant structure below 900 mev in the @xmath1-wave in @xmath5 is required to saturate the adler - weisberger sum rule for @xmath88 scattering and to produce the equality @xmath57",
    ". a narrow resonance like @xmath2 will not do it .",
    "but then , what does saturate the adler - weisberger sum rule for @xmath5 scattering?@xcite    we suggest that the solutions @xmath6 and @xmath7 provide the answer . in these two solutions",
    "the narrow @xmath2 manifests itself as a broad resonant structure at @xmath54 720 mev in the flip helicity amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "this broad resonant structure will appear also in the @xmath1-wave in @xmath5 and we conjecture that it will saturate the adler s sum rule as required by weinberg s mended symmetry .",
    "weinberg s mended symmetry then selects the solution combinatins @xmath6 and @xmath7 . when combined with the ellis - lanik relation ,",
    "the preferred solution is @xmath6 . from table",
    "i we see that the corresponding @xmath12 mev compares well with particle data group value @xmath89 mev@xcite . in the following we thus refer to the @xmath16 resonance as @xmath2 .",
    "a question now arises how a chirally invariant and narrow resonance in the nonflip amplitude @xmath3 can also manifest itself as a broad resonant state breaking chiral symmetry in the flip amplitude @xmath4 , i.e. in @xmath5 scattering .",
    "we suggest that the answer may lie in the interaction of the chirally invariant @xmath2 with the chirally noninvariant qcd vacuum in the @xmath5 scattering .",
    "it is well - known that qed vacuum participates in electromagnetic processes .",
    "for instance , the photon propagator is modified by the vacuum polarization@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the scalar gluonic current interacts strongly with qcd vacuum .",
    "recently kharzeev and collaborators demonstrated that qcd vacuum participates in hadron interactions at low as well as at high energies with involvement of the qcd trace anomaly@xcite .",
    "in general , the involvement of the qcd vacuum may depend on the hadronic process and in @xmath5 scattering it could result in the metamorphosis of the narrow and chirally invariant @xmath2 into a broad resonant structure associated with breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "chiral symmetry allows for two phases of qcd vacuum : asymmetric and degenerate nambu - goldstone phase and a symmetric wigner - weyl phase@xcite .",
    "the interaction of the chirally invariant @xmath2 with qcd vacuum in @xmath5 scattering could also modify the vacuum itself@xcite .",
    "brown and rho used the dilaton - gluonium scalar field @xmath16 and ellis - lanik effective lagrangian to describe the change of qcd vacuum in a dense medium@xcite .",
    "superconvergence sum rules assumed in weinberg s mended symmetry are based on analyticity of helicity amplitdes .",
    "analyticity connects hadron dynamics at low and high energies and is thus used also in amplitude analyses of hadronic reactions .",
    "qcd vacuum participates in hadron scattering also at low and high enegies@xcite .",
    "the reason why analyticity seems to reflect important aspects of hadron dynamics could be that it originates in some way from the structure of qcd vacuum .",
    "finally we note that in 1968 when gilman and harari published their paper@xcite , only @xmath16 and @xmath85 were assumed to contribute to @xmath88 scattering . today we know of many more resonances the contribution of which",
    "should be taken into account in the saturation of the sum rules each of which becomes more complicated .",
    "also , the presence of these resonances enlarges the set of sum rules equations .",
    "we suggest that the sum rules equations factorize into a chain of solvable sets with the gilman - harari set of @xmath90 and @xmath50 forming the first ( lowest mass ) set .",
    "these sets could in fact be the representations ( multiplets ) of the weinberg s mended symmetry .",
    "if such is the case , then mended symmetry could provide a new organizing principle of the hadron spectra and effective qcd dynamics .",
    "the mass and width of the @xmath16 resonance in the preferred solution combination @xmath6 are from table i    @xmath92    a comparison with particle data group@xcite values for mass and width of the @xmath93 meson @xmath94 indicates a strong @xmath95 degeneracy .",
    "this experimentally observed @xmath96 degeneracy leads to some interesting consequences . in the following we set @xmath57 and @xmath97 .    using the usual @xmath98 coupling , the @xmath99 decay width",
    "is given by@xcite    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the pion decay constant and @xmath102 is the pion momentum in the rest frame of @xmath93 . with @xmath62 , the ellis - lanik relation ( 1.5 )",
    "then relates the gluon condensate and the pion decay constant    @xmath103    the @xmath15 chiral condensate @xmath104 is related to the pion decay constant by the gell - mann , oakes and renner ( gmor ) relation@xcite    @xmath105    the new measurements of @xmath106 decay by e865 collaboration at bnl@xcite have been used recently to verify the validity of the gmor relation@xcite . combining ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5 )",
    "we get a new relation for chiral condensate in terms of the gluon condensate    @xmath107    the new relations ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.6 ) are a nontrivial consequence of ellis - lanik effective lagrangian which is coding the breaking of scale symmetry and confinement in qcd and the cern measurements of pion production on polarized target .    with pdg value @xmath101 = 92.4 mev , the relation ( 4.4 ) gives the following value for the gluon condensate    @xmath108    with pdg average value @xmath109 = 8 mev and using @xmath30 from ( 4.7 ) we obtain from relation ( 4.6 ) a value of chiral condensate    @xmath110    the value of @xmath30 is in agreement with the value from ellis - lanik relation for the solution combination @xmath6 shown in table i and in a reasonable agreement with the accepted value ( 2.1 ) .",
    "the value of the qcd scale @xmath111 from ( 4.8 ) is in agreement with recent expectations .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the gluon and chiral condensates for @xmath112    @xmath113    @xmath114    comparing the values ( 4.7 ) and ( 4.9 ) for the gluon condensate @xmath30 we notice that the value ( 4.9 ) for @xmath63 = 1 is in a better agreement with the accepted value @xmath30 = 0.0117 @xmath115 0.0051 gev@xmath69 in ( 2.1 ) .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath30 calculated from ellis - lanik relation assuming @xmath112 are also closer to the accepted value of @xmath30 in ( 2.1 ) but still selecting solutions @xmath6 and @xmath8 with @xmath30 = 0.0116 @xmath115 0.0028 gev@xmath69 and @xmath30 = 0.0122 @xmath115 0.0056 gev@xmath69 , respectively .",
    "it appears that these improved agreements with the accepted value of gluon condensate require an additional factor of @xmath116 in the ellis - lanik relation ( 1.5 ) and in relations ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.6 ) .",
