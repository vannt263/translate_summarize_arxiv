    "it has been stressed by leggett @xcite that quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable states are invaluable for testing the validity of quantum theory as well as advancing emerging quantum technologies such as precision measurement and quantum computing .",
    "a prime example is the observation of quantum superpositions of persistent currents in superconducting quantum interference devices that are candidates as qubits in future quantum computers  @xcite . spurred on by these developments",
    "there are several proposals to create flow states in atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , either in a trap or on a ring .",
    "flow states are those states in which all atoms are in the same angular - momentum eigenstate with winding number @xmath1 so that the total angular momentum is @xmath2 , and a bec in a flow state exhibits the peculiarities of superfluidity .",
    "proposals include stirring using rotating light - shift potentials @xcite , `` phase engineering '' involving a gaussian laser beam whose center is rotated and that couples the external motion to the internal state via rabi oscillations @xcite , and most significantly for this work , vortex coupling in which two - photon stimulated raman transitions are driven using laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) fields to transfer orbital angular momentum ( oam ) from the lg beam photons to the trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "experiments from nist have already demonstrated quantized rotation of trapped atoms using lg fields @xcite , and persistent flow of a bec in a toroidal trap @xcite .",
    "the above proposals do not produce quantum superpositions of flow states but rather _ each atom _ is generally excited into a superposition of angular - momentum states . in contrast",
    "theoretical works have appeared involving creation of macroscopic superpositions of becs @xcite .",
    "of particular interest here is the recent work on macroscopic superposition states in ring superlattices in which an array of becs trapped in optical potentials are coupled via tunneling and formed into a ring , thereby creating a discrete analogue of a ring bec @xcite .",
    "these authors have proposed a scheme for creating macroscopic superpositions of persistent flows on the ring superlattice .",
    "are driven via two - photon stimulated raman transitions to different hyperfine ground states @xmath3 with different winding numbers via electronic excited state @xmath4 .",
    "the winding numbers of the lg fields involved are shown in parenthesis . ]",
    "the goal of this article is to propose a new scheme to generate quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinct flow states for ultracold bosonic atoms trapped circumferentially on a ring , as opposed to a ring lattice , using two - photon stimulated raman transitions driven by a pump field that is a classical optical vortex , and a second quantized laser field that is a cat state of optical vortices of opposite winding number @xmath5 .",
    "assuming that all the atoms are initially in a non - rotating hyperfine ground state atomic level , the key to our scheme is that the combination of the classical pump field with each of the two individual components of the cat state can drive the atoms via the two - photon transitions into different hyperfine ground states representing different flow states , so that the field cat state can generate a quantum superposition of flow states .",
    "wright has previously described how cat states of optical vortices may be generated , and introduced an idea of generating macroscopic superpositions of matter wave as a potential application of an optical cat state  @xcite . in this article",
    "we advance this idea in a concrete geometry and explicitly show that the approach is feasible . that the cat state nature of the driving quantized optical field can be transferred to the atoms",
    "is not surprising in view of previous studies of quantum atom optics involving becs in quantized light fields  @xcite , and of conditional quantum dynamics , in which the quantum dynamics of a subsystem , here the atoms , depends on the state of another subsystem , here the light field , wherein the initially uncorrelated two subsystems get entangled  @xcite . in the remainder of this article we first discuss cat states of optical vortices that are required for our scheme and then turn to the analysis of how the quantum superpositions of flow states are generated .",
    "for our scheme the atoms are assumed to be trapped circumferentially on a ring in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane and to be illuminated by a pair of laser fields co - propagating along the @xmath8-axis whose centers coincide with the ring center , see fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the pump field is a lg beam of winding number @xmath9 with @xmath10 that we will treat classically , and the second field is a cat state of lg fields of winding numbers @xmath5 that we treat quantum mechanically . in particular , taking the cat state and the pump laser to have frequencies @xmath11 , @xmath12 , polarizations @xmath13 , @xmath14 , mode profiles @xmath15 , @xmath16 , mode volumes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and propagation numbers @xmath19 , @xmath20 , respectively , we write the positive frequency component for the entire light field operator in the heisenberg picture as @xmath21 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the annihilation operators for the lg modes with winding numbers @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , we consider cat states of optical vortices of the form @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 represents the occupation of the oam state @xmath26 in a quantum state @xmath27 , and @xmath28 the vacuum .",
    "a natural choice is a cat states of coherent states with opposite winding numbers @xmath29 , @xmath30/\\sqrt{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in writing this field quantum state we have assumed that @xmath31 so that we may treat @xmath32 and the vacuum state @xmath33 as orthogonal for all practical purposes .",
    "we thus consistently neglect all terms of order @xmath34 throughout .",
    "some words are in order regarding the generation of cat states of optical vortices .",
    "a great deal of research has been directed towards creating quantum superpositions of optical vortices for use in quantum information processing , but these typically involve small numbers of photons  @xcite .",
    "wright has previously described how cat states of optical vortices may be generated using self - phase modulation based on electromagnetically - induced transparency enhanced kerr nonlinearities for atoms loaded into hollow core photonic - crystal fibers @xcite , and glancy and macedo de vasconcelos  @xcite have reviewed a number of methods to produce cat states of coherent states , including the kerr effect , degenerate optical parametric oscillators , back - action evasion measurement , and photon subtraction .",
    "furthermore , recent work by de martini and co - workers @xcite shows promise for creating an entangled field state with high resilience against the detrimental effects of decoherence @xcite in which a macrostate with more than @xmath35 photons is entangled with a microstate containing one photon using a quantum - injected quantum parametric amplifier .",
    "each of these methods could be used to create cat states of optical vortices if the two coherent state components of the cat state can be produced with suitable entangled spatial beam properties @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the configuration of the hyperfine atomic states denoted as @xmath36 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , coupled via the lg fields .",
    "the atoms are initially prepared in the non - rotating state @xmath36 , the pump laser couples the initial state @xmath36 and an excited state @xmath4 of angular momentum @xmath9 , while the quantized light field in the optical cat state couples @xmath3 of the angular momentum @xmath37 and @xmath4 , transitions between @xmath36 and @xmath3 being dipole forbidden .",
    "the single - photon detunings @xmath38,\\delta=[\\omega-(\\omega_e-\\omega_b)]$ ] are chosen large enough that the excited state @xmath4 is negligibly populated by single - photon absorption , allowing the excited state to be adiabatically eliminated . here",
    "we denote the energy level of each hyperfine state as @xmath39 \\psi_0 $ ] with @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 being the single - particle trapping potentials and the internal energies , respectively , and @xmath43 is the atomic mass .",
    "we assume that the atoms are tightly trapped circumferentially on a ring by the single - particle potential , and that they are described by the same cylindrically symmetric atomic center - of - mass ground state wave function @xmath44 . then treating the pump laser as a classical @xmath45-number field @xmath46 , the hamiltonian for our system in the dipole and rotating - wave approximations reads    @xmath47\\hat{b}_+^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_+ + \\left [ \\hbar\\delta + \\frac{\\hbar^2(p-1)^2}{2mr^2 } \\right]\\hat{b}_-^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_- + \\hat{h}_{\\rm col } + \\left[\\hbar g\\alpha_p^*\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}(\\hat{b}_-\\hat{c}_++\\hat{b}_+\\hat{c}_-)+h.c.\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left[\\hbar g_{bc}\\hat{b}_-^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_+\\hat{c}_+^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_-+h.c.\\right ] + \\hbar g_{bc}(\\hat{c}_+^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_++\\hat{c}_-^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_- ) ( \\hat{b}_+^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_++\\hat{b}_-^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_-)+\\hbar g_{ap}|\\alpha_p|^2 \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 denotes the two - photon detuning .",

    "( [ coherent_cat ] ) , and the initial atomic state @xmath70 in terms of fock basis @xmath71 with respect to the atomic states @xmath72 .",
    "we assume that atoms and field are initially uncorrelated for @xmath73 , and the initial state is thus written as @xmath74 .",
    "when the atoms are irradiated by the pump and cat state fields they will drive two - photon transitions between the levels @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and the atoms will in turn re - radiate and produce new radiation in addition to the incident fields , and in this way the fields will generally be time - dependent",
    ". however , our main focus here is the quantum dynamics of the atoms as opposed to the radiation produced by the atoms , and we make the approximation that the fields acting specifically on the atoms may be approximated by the unmodified incident fields .",
    "this is very reasonable given that any time - dependent radiated fields will be directed away from the ring and our geometry does no include an optical cavity that could redirect the radiated fields back onto the ring .",

    "we took the coherent amplitudes as real numbers without loss of generality , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . ]",
    "we start with examination of the quantum dynamics with just one component , say @xmath92 , of the optical cat state present , and we neglect atomic collisions for simplicity . replacing @xmath93 , @xmath94 in the hamiltonian  ( [ h ] )",
    ", we obtain the heisenberg equations of motion @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , where @xmath98/2 $ ] , and @xmath99 .",
    "the above heisenberg equations are exactly soluble , and for the initial atomic state @xmath70 , the population in each component evolves in time as @xmath100\\\\ & & n_+(t)=0,\\quad n_-(t)=n\\left ( \\frac{|g\\alpha_p\\alpha|^2}{\\omega_-^2}\\right ) \\sin^2 ( \\omega_- t ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the rabi frequency @xmath101 . at the two - photon detuning @xmath102 , complete and periodic oscillations occur between the non - rotating state @xmath36 and the atomic state @xmath103 with winding number @xmath104 . similarly ,",
    "if we consider solely the @xmath87 component of the field cat state one finds complete periodic oscillations of frequency @xmath105 between the non - rotating state @xmath36 and the atomic state @xmath106 with winding number @xmath107 for a detuning @xmath108 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows ( a ) the maximum transfer amplitudes @xmath109 of the oscillations between the two atomic states involved , and ( b ) the oscillation frequencies @xmath110 normalized by @xmath111 for the two components of the field cat state , both as functions of detuning @xmath112 .",
    "the crux of our proposal is now as follows : since the two transfer amplitude curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) are well resolved this means that by choosing the detuning @xmath112 at one of the peaks we can have one of the atomic components @xmath113 be off - resonant and remain largely in the non - rotating state , whereas the other atomic state component @xmath114 is transferred to the flow state with winding number @xmath115 depending on the peak chosen . using this we can generate a quantum superposition as in eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , and this is a key message of this paper .",
    "next we provide a numerical example to demonstrate that our scheme for the generation of quantum superpositions of flow states can survive the inclusion of atomic collisions .",
    "many - body collisions complicate the generation process in that they nonlinearly modify the detuning required for coupling between the atomic states , and the transfer between the atomic states is generally no longer complete . as previously discussed @xcite",
    "this can be offset by sweeping the detuning in time , and we do this here by setting @xmath116 so that the detuning at @xmath117 is to the right of the left peak in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "we set @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , all other parameters being identical to those in fig .",
    "the atomic state vector is expanded in terms of the fock basis @xmath121 where @xmath122 signifies summing over all combinations of the three zero or positive integers @xmath123 satisfying the condition @xmath124 , and the equations of motion for the amplitudes @xmath125 according to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) are solved numerically .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows ( a ) the population in each atomic component @xmath126 with @xmath127 , ( b ) the population in each atomic state @xmath128 , and ( c ) the corresponding number fluctuations @xmath129 , all as a function of time .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) demonstrates that since the detuning is such that the atomic state @xmath130 remains off - resonance , the population is transferred only in the branch @xmath82 from @xmath131 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath132 fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) demonstrates that the non - rotating state @xmath36 and the rotating state @xmath103 with winding number @xmath104 occur with equal probability @xmath133 , indicative of the desired quantum superposition but indistinguishable at this point from a number state where half the population is transferred to each component @xmath134 . to distinguish these states we realize that we have as a target state the quantum superposition @xmath135/\\sqrt{2}$ ] , with @xmath136 a phase resulting from the light - matter and atom interactions . for the quantum superposition the number fluctuations are @xmath137 , @xmath138 , whereas for the number state @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and figure  [ fig3](c ) supports the case that our scheme generates a quantum superposition of flow states .",
    "finally we introduce the fidelity @xmath141 of the quantum superposition , and for each time we vary the phase @xmath136 to attain the maximum value .",
    "the fidelity is plotted versus time in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) and we find a maximum value @xmath142 , impressive given that we have not applied any particular optimization .",
    "the reduction of the fidelity from the ideal value of unity is associated with the detrimental effects of collisions leading to a broad distribution of the atom statistics @xmath143 that are peaked around @xmath144 .",
    "it thus follows that increasing collisions tends to reduce the peak fidelity , so reducing collisions is one strategy , but we anticipate that the fidelity can be greatly improved even for larger collisions by applying quantum control methods to our scheme , and we plan to pursue this in future work .",
    "we have described a new scheme to generate quantum superpositions of flow states of ultracold atoms on a ring using vortex coupling employing a coherent state optical vortex cat state , and numerically demonstrated that the scheme works even in the presence of collisions .",
    "an outstanding issue is the extreme fragility of coherent state cat states to decoherence which is an issue for even generating the field cat state . to address this we also performed simulations employing squeezed state optical vortex cat states , which have increased resilience to decoherence  @xcite , and found very similar results to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , with almost identical maximum fidelities .",
    "there is also the issue of how our results are modified in the limit of cat field states with low photon number which are more resilient to decoherence . in that case",
    "our analysis becomes very similar to that of lo gullo _ et al .",
    ", _ who considered the entanglement of spatially separated becs using oam - entangled two - photon states , and their analysis illustrates that entanglement still occurs for small photon numbers beyond our approximations  @xcite . we plan to explore these and other issues further in future publications .",
