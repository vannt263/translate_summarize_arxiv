    "the stokes theorem is one of the central points of analysis on manifolds .",

    "eq . known as the abelian stokes theorem can be generalized to the non - abelian case [ [ b01 ] ] .",
    "there are several approaches to the non - abelian stokes theorem ( nast ) , and a lot of various aspects of the nast have been already discussed [ [ b03 ] ] .",
    "one of them , initiated in [ [ b04 ] ] , concerns the nast for ( possibly ) topologically nontrivial wilson loop(s ) @xmath8 .",
    "in particular three dimensional case ( @xmath9 ) , it may happen that @xmath8 is knotted ( or linked , for multicomponent @xmath8 ) , and a direct application of the nast is impossible . in such instances",
    "we must invoke a more general procedure .",
    "formally , we can write the nast as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are appropriately defined orderings , and @xmath13 is the `` twisted '' non - abelian curvature @xmath14 of the connection @xmath15 , @xmath16 , see [ [ b01 ] ] or [ [ b03 ] ] for details .",
    "if @xmath8 bounds a disk @xmath17 , eq .",
    "is directly applicable , if not , one can resort to [ [ b04 ] ] , where a version of the nast for knots and links has been formulated .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we intend to make the implicit procedure of [ [ b04 ] ] more explicit .",
    "secondly , we will present a generalization of the nast allowing intersecting wilson loops .",
    "the essence of the standard nast in operator version is a decomposition of the initial loop @xmath7 onto lassos bounding disks of infinitesimal areas . for a star - like @xmath17",
    "the procedure is straightforward and well - known but for a topologically non - trivial @xmath8 the decomposition becomes cumbersome .",
    "an elegant solution of the problem has been proposed in [ [ b04 ] ] , where the authors have found an ( implicit ) general decomposition of @xmath8 suitable for a direct application of the nast .",
    "the starting point of their analysis is an arbitrary connected orientable two - dimensional surface @xmath18 given in a `` canonical '' form . since",
    "a knot is always a boundary of a surface , the so - called seifert surface @xmath19 ( a connected orientable surface ) , the problem is solved once an appropriate decomposition for this surface is established .",
    "but it is still unclear how one can translate the decomposition of [ [ b04 ] ] for the surface @xmath18 given in a canonical form onto decomposition of the actual seifert surface @xmath19 . to fill the gap",
    ", we will propose a procedure enabling to smoothly pass between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    to begin with , following [ [ b02 ] ] we are recalling the construction of the seifert surface @xmath19 for a knot @xmath8 .",
    "let us assign @xmath8 an orientation , and examine its regular projection .",
    "near each crossing point , let us delete the over- and under - crossings , and replace them by `` short - cut '' arcs .",
    "we now have a disjoint collection of closed curves bounding disks , possibly nested .",
    "these disks can be made disjoint by pushing their interiors slightly off the plane .",
    "now , let us connect them together at the old crossings with half - twisted strips to from @xmath19 . in the case of a multicomponent @xmath8 ( link )",
    ", we join components by tubes , if necessary .",
    "now , we will describe the procedure of deformation of the seifert surface @xmath19 onto the canonical from @xmath18 . to this end",
    ", we should realize that according to the previous paragraph our starting point are ( ordinary ) disks connected with strips ( fig.[f01 ] ) .    the starting point : ordinary disks connected with strips.,width=480,height=153 ]    shortening a strip , and bringing any two connected disks together we join them reducing their number by one ( fig.[f02 ] ) .",
    "bringing two connected disks together , and joining them reducing their number by one.,width=480,height=192 ]    let us repeat this procedure until we end up with a single disk .",
    "now , let us concentrate on the first two strips .",
    "they can be `` crossed '' or `` nested '' ( fig.[f03 ] ) .",
    "the first two strips can be `` crossed '' or `` nested''.,width=480,height=192 ]    in the case of nested strips , we can decouple them sliding the first one over the second one , from the left to the right ( fig.[f04 ] ) .",
    "sliding the first strip over the second one we decouple them.,width=480,height=192 ]    in the case of crossed strips , we slide together the whole two bunches of all interior strips ( `` counter clockwise '' ) over the two crossed strips separating the bunches from them ( fig.[f05 ] ) .",
    "sliding together the whole two bunches of all interior strips ( `` counter clockwise '' ) over the two crossed strip separates the bunches from them.,width=480,height=192 ]    let us repeat this procedure until we end up with a sequence of `` decoupled '' single strips and single pairs of crossed strips ( fig.[f06 ] ) .",
    "of course , the decoupling takes place only on the boundary of the disk , and the strips can be intertwined in a very complicated way .",
    "we end up with a sequence of `` decoupled '' single strips and single pairs of crossed strips .",
    "we should complete the disk on the left with elements on the right.,width=480,height=172 ]    for a link , it may happen that the initial seifert surface is disconnected .",
    "in such a case , after obtaining a single disk for each component , let us join the disks by tubes ( fig.[f07 ] ) .",
    "disconnected disks should be joined by tubes.,width=480,height=134 ]    before we engage in ordering of strips we should cancel the tubes . reducing the `` size '' of the first disk and shortening the first tube , and next bringing the two first disks together",
    "we join them decreasing their number by one ( fig.[f08 ] ) .     reducing the `` size '' of the first disk and",
    "shortening the first tube , and next bringing the two first disks together we join them decreasing their number by one.,width=480,height=134 ]     each such on operation creates a hole with strips inside the second disk.,width=480,height=134 ]     pushing the hole out of the interior of the disk we obtain a standard disk with a larger number of strips.,width=480,height=134 ]    each such an operation creates o hole with strips inside the second disk ( fig.[f09 ] ) . pushing the hole out of the interior of the disk we obtain a standard disk with a larger number of strips ( fig.[f10 ] ) .",
    "let us keep on repeating the procedure until all the tubes disappear and return to disentangling strips described earlier for a ( single ) knot @xmath8 .",
    "the whole method of the previous section can be reused to extend the nast to the case of intersecting wilson loops ( knots / links ) .",
    "let us return to the construction of the seifert surface @xmath19 .",
    "now , some of the crossing points of a regular projection are `` true '' crossing points ( intersection points ) . splitting the intersection points in an arbitrary way ( fig.[f11 ] )     splitting the intersection point.,width=288,height=115 ]    we",
    "get rid off the true crossing points , and the procedure of the previous section becomes fully applicable .",
    "but the memory about the intersections should remain encoded in the form of `` pinching '' lines identifying the intersection points .",
    "these lines lie on strips , and in the course of all necessary arrangements and deformations they persist in lying on the seifert surface . after joining all the disks",
    "all the lines fall in the final disk .",
    "the ordering procedure consisting in sliding the strips drags the lines inside the strips .",
    "therefore , the seifert surface brought to the canonical form @xmath18 is covered by two independent systems of curves .",
    "the first , very regular one follows from the procedure of [ [ b04 ] ] and is responsible for cutting @xmath20 into simply connected surfaces ( disks ) .",
    "the second system of curves , possibly complicated and chaotically looking , generated by the present procedure , indicates necessary pinching and identification of points .",
    "a disk created by the first system of curves should be now pinched by curves of the second system ( fig.[f11 ] read backwards ) becoming a bunch of disks , and the standard nast becomes .",
    "the best and easiest explanation of the whole procedure can be given in the form of an example .",
    "let us consider a trefoil knot with one intersection ( denoted with a dot ) as our example ( fig.[f12 ] , lines without arrows ) .",

    "the disks @xmath21 and @xmath22 should be cut into two pieces ( k=1,3).,width=480,height=134 ]    therefore for example eq.(2.10 ) of [ [ b04 ] ] , written is our notation as @xmath23[d_4][d_b]^{-1}[d_3][d_a]^{-1}[d_2][d_b][d_1],\\ ] ] should assume now the from @xmath23[d_4][d_b]^{-1}[d_{3,1}][d_{3,2}][d_a]^{-1}[d_2][d_b][d_{1,1}][d_{1,2}],\\ ] ] where the second subscript counts the newly created , with use of pinching lines , disks .",
    "going backwards from fig.[f14 ] to fig.[f12 ] we obtain an explicit decomposition of the trefoil knot ready for the application of the standard nast .",
