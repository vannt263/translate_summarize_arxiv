    "the field of black hole thermodynamics started around the time bekenstein and hawking argued that black holes have entropy and temperature , given respectively by @xcite : s_bh =   t_h =  , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the mass and horizon area of the black hole , and @xmath2 is the planck length in four dimensions .",
    "together , they satisfy the following laws , which are analogous to the laws of classical thermodynamics . ] : d(mc^2 ) & = & t_hds + dq + dj   + s_bh & & 0   .",
    "the question naturally arises as to whether there are miscroscopic , elementary states , consistent with the black hole temperature and other macroscopic parameters , whose logarithm gives its entropy : s_bh =   , and if so , then what those states are .",
    "another related question in this area of research is the following : is the area proportionality of the entropy , also know as the _ area law _ ( al ) in eq.([temp1 ] ) ( as opposed to volume proportionality , which is the case for normal thermodynamic systems ) more generic , or in fact universal , beyond the realm of black holes ?",
    "this has given rise to the so - called _ holographic hypothesis _",
    ", which conjectures that the information content of our universe may be encoded in a two dimensional screen which surrounds three dimensional space .    finally , the expectation that black holes , after absorbing matter ( and information contained therein ) will radiate itself away in the form of pure thermal radiation at the temperature ( [ temp1 ] ) , has given rise to the _ information loss problem _",
    ": thermal radiation does not contain any information , except that of the temperature of the emitting source , so if the black hole disappears completely , does the information do so as well ? while there is nothing in principle which prevents this form happening , it requires the quantum mechanics which governs the evolution to be non - unitary , since unitary evolution takes pure states to pure states .",
    "this eventually raises the question : _ does quantum mechanics break down in the presence of a black hole ? _ to be able to address one or more of the above questions , one has to first explore origins of black hole entropy and temperature . among the various approaches that have been undertaken , the two most popular are : string theory and loop quantum gravity . in the first , degeneracy of strings attached to @xmath3-branes",
    "are claimed to give rise to the required degeneracy , while in the second , the spin - network states at the horizon are invoked for the same purpose .",
    "there have been some other interesting approaches as well @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above , there has been another idea , which goes as follows : consider a free scalar field , propagating in a spacetime containing a black hole .",
    "now , do a partial tracing over the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the field which are inside the horizon .",
    "the resultant density matrix is mixed , due to the information being ` hidden ' by the horizon ( although the entire system , before tracing , is pure ) .",
    "when one computes the _ entanglement entropy _ associated with this , the latter turns out to be proportional to the horizon area @xcite ! [ the analytical proof for the area law have recently been shown in refs . @xcite . ]",
    "it is this approach which we will follow in this article . here",
    "we will critically examine an important assumption that the authors had made in their analyses : that the scalar field is in its _ ground state _",
    "while this simplifying assumption is justified and even natural to make in a first calculation , we would like to see how important it really is to validity of the al .",
    "indeed we will find that while replacing the gs by generic _ coherent state _ ( cs ) or a class of _ squeezed states _ ( ss ) does not affect the al , doing so with a class of _ excited states _",
    "( es ) does change the al , and in fact renders the entropy proportional to a power of area less than unity .",
    "one can ask as to why we consider a scalar field .",
    "while we do not have a completely satisfactory answer to this question , we are motivated by the fact that a significant part of gravitational perturbations in black hole backgrounds are scalar in nature @xcite .",
    "so the scalar field does not have to be introduced _ by hand _ from outside .",
    "this article is organised as follows : in the next section , we briefly review entanglement in quantum mechanics and its role in entropy . in section 3 , we set up the formalism for computing entropy of entangled scalar fields in flat spacetime , when the field is in its ground state . in section 4 , we extend our results to generic coherent states and a class of squeezed states . in section 5 ,",
    "we examine excited states and their effects on entanglement entropy . in section 6",
    ", we try to pin - point the location of the dof which are responsible for entanglement entropy . in section 7 ,",
    "we extend our results to black hole spacetimes . in section 8 ,",
    "we conclude with a summary and open questions .",
    "consider a quantum mechanical system , which can be decomposed into two subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as shown below :    [ cols=\"<\",options=\"header \" , ]     correspondingly , the hilbert space of the system is a kronecker product of the subsystem hilbert spaces : = h_u _ v  . if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are eigenbases in @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , then @xmath10 form an eigenbasis in @xmath11 , in terms of which a generic wavefunction @xmath12 in @xmath13 can be expanded : | = _ ij d_ij |u_i |v_j  .",
    "note however , that in general , @xmath12 can not be factorised into two wavefunctions , one in @xmath4 and the other in @xmath5 : ||_u|_v  .",
    "such states are called _ entangled states _ or _",
    "epr states_. the ones that can be factorised , on the other hand , are called _",
    "unentangled states_. for example , for a system with two spins , the following is an unentangled state : |+ | = |(|+ | )  , while the following is an entangled state : |+ |    teleportation_.    next , let us define density matrices . if the quantum - mechanical wavefunction of a system is known ( however complex the system might be ) , its density matrix is defined as : ||  .",
    "it can easily be verified that @xmath14 satisfies the following properties : || 0  ,  ^= ,  ^2 =  .the last property is known as _ idempotency _ , from which it follows that the eigenvalue @xmath15 of the density matrix can only be @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "thus the _ entanglement entropy _ or _ von neumann entropy _ , defined as follows , vanishes : s - tr ( ) = - _ n p_n p_n = 0  .",
    "now , one can take the trace of @xmath14 , only in the subsystem @xmath5 , to find the _ reduced density matrix _",
    ", which is still an operator in subsystem @xmath4 : _ u = tr_v ( ) = _ l v_l | | v_l = _ i , k , j d_ij d^_kj |u_i u_k|",
    ". for @xmath18 , it can be shown that the following properties hold : |_u| 0  ,   _",
    "u^= _ u  ,   _ u^2 _ u  . that is , idempotency no longer holds . as a result , its eigenvalues now satisfy : @xmath19 , and the entanglement entropy is non - zero : s_u - tr_u ( _ u _ u ) = - _ n p_n(u ) p_n(u ) > 0  .",
    "the ignorance resulting from tracing over one part of the system manifests itself as entropy .",
    "one important property of reduced density matrices is that if we traced over @xmath4 instead and found the reduced density matrix @xmath20 , then the latter would have the same set of non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "consequently , the entanglement entropies are equal , being a common property of the entangled system : @xmath21",
    "now consider a free scalar field in @xmath22-dimensional flat space , with the following hamiltonian : h = d^3x  . decomposing the field and its conjugate momentum into partial waves ( r ) = _ lm  y_lm ( , )  ,   ( r ) = _ lm  y_lm ( , )",
    "yields : h = _ lm h_lm = _ lm _ 0^dr \\ { _ lm^2(r ) + x^2 ^2 +  _ lm^2(r ) }  .",
    "next , discretise along the radial direction with lattice spacing @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 .",
    "the lattice is terminated at a large but finite @xmath25 ( ` size of the universe ' ) , and an intermediate point @xmath26 is chosen , which we call the _ horizon _ , and which separates the lattice points between an ` inside ' and an ` outside ' . as of now , there is nothing intrinsically special about this point , although later we will associate it with a black hole horizon .",
    "the discretisation is depicted below :    @xmath27    the discretised version of hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) takes the form : h_lm = _",
    "note that it resembles the hamiltonian of a set of @xmath25 coupled harmonic oscillators , with the interaction between them contained in the off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath28 ( the coordinates @xmath29 replace the field variables @xmath30 ) : h = _",
    "i=1^n p_i^2 + _ i ,",
    "j=1^n x_i k_ij x_j the density matrix , tracing over the first @xmath26 of @xmath25 oscillators ( @xmath31 ) , is given by : ( x ; x ) = _",
    "i=1^n  dx_i  ( x_1,  ,x_n;x_n+1,  ,x_n )   ^(x_1,  ,x_n;x_n+1, ",
    ",x_n ) where ( @xmath32diagonal ) .",
    "the wavefunction ( x_1,  ,x_n ) = _ i=1^n n_i  h__i ( k_d  i^  x_i ) ( - k_d  i^",
    "x_i^2 ) denotes the most general eigenstate of hamiltonian ( [ ham3 ] ) , being a product of @xmath25 harmonic oscillator wavefunctions .",
    "note that @xmath33 , since @xmath34 is mixed , although the full state is pure .",
    "consequently , the entanglement entropy @xmath35 for the scalar field hamiltonian ( [ ham2a ] ) , @xmath28 can be read - off : k_ij & = &   + & & -_i , j+1 - _ i , j-1  .",
    "note that the last two terms denote ( nearest - neighbour ) interaction and originates in the derivative term in ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "schematically ,    k = (    lllllll & & & & & & + & & & & & & + & & & & & & + & & & & & & + & & & & & & + & & & & & & + & & & & & & +    )    where the off - diagonal terms represent interactions .",
    "the gs of the above hamiltonian is given by : ( x_1,  ,x_n ) = _",
    "i=1^n n_i ( - k_di^ x_i^2 ) which follows from ( [ wavefn2 ] ) , by setting all @xmath36 to zero .",
    "the corresponding density matrix ( [ den2 ] ) can be evaluated exactly ( the suffix @xmath16 signifies gs ) : _ 0 ( x , x ) ~ where :    ~k^1/2 = (    ll a & b + b^t & c +    )  ,  = b^ta^-1b  ,  = c-  . note that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are non - zero if and only if there are interactions .",
    "the gaussian nature of the above density matrix lends itself to a series of diagonalisations diag , @xmath39 , @xmath40 diag , @xmath41  . ] , such that it reduces to a product of @xmath42 , @xmath43-oscillator density matrices , in each of which one oscillator is traced over @xcite : _ _ 0(x , x ) ~_i=1^n - n  .",
    "the corresponding entropy is given by : s = _ i=1^n - n ( - - _ i )   .",
    "thus , for the full hamiltonian @xmath44 , the entropy is : s = _ l=0^ ( 2 l+ 1 ) s_l where the degeneracy factor @xmath45 follows from spherical symmetry of the hamiltonian . in practice",
    ", we will replace the upper bound of the sum in the above to a large value @xmath46 . for the interaction matrix ( [ kij1 ] ) , the above entropy , computed numerically , turned out to be @xcite : s = 0.3 ( n+1/2)^2 0.3 ( ) ^2  .",
    "the logarithm of the entropy versus the logarithm of the radius of the horizon is plotted in figure 1 , and the slope is seen to be @xmath43 .    2.80 in",
    "in this section , we first examine the situation when gs in ( [ gs2 ] ) is replaced by coherent states .",
    "a cs ( ` shifted ' ground state ) is defined as the following , for which @xmath47 : ( x_1,  ,x_n)_cs & = & _ i=1^n n_i ( - k_di^ ( x_i - _ i)^2 ) + & = & _ i=1^n ( -i_i _ i ) n_i ( - k_di^ x_i^2 ) where @xmath48  .",
    "next , defining @xmath49 , it is easy to show that the density matrix for the cs can be written as : _ cs ( x ; x ) = _",
    "i=1^n  dx_i  _ cs ( x_1,  ;x_n+1 ,  )   _ cs^(x_1,  ;x_n+1 ,  ) = ( x ; x )  .",
    "remarkably , the density matrix has the same function form as the gs density matrix ( [ gsden ] ) , albeit in terms of the tilded variables .",
    "however , this means that the eigenfunctions will be identical to those for the gs , as a function of the tilded variables .",
    "consequently , the eigenvalues , and hence the entropy will be the same as those of the gs @xcite !",
    "ss are also minimum uncertainty packets , for which for which @xmath47",
    ". however , they are characterised by @xmath50 or @xmath51 ( or vice - versa ) . here",
    ", we consider a class of ss , characterised by a single parameter @xmath52 , and given by the following wavefunction : _ _ ss(x_1,  ,x_n ) = r^n/2 _",
    "i=1^n n_i  . in this case , defining a new variable as : @xmath53 the density matrix becomes : _ ss ( x ; x ) = _",
    "i=1^n  dx_i  _ ss ( x_1,  ;x_n+1 ,  )   _ ss^(x_1,  ;x_n+1 ,  ) = ( x ; x )  .",
    "once again , it has the same functional form , and the entropy is same as that for the ground state @xcite .",
    "although , ideally one would like to compute the entanglement entropy for the most general eigenstate ( or superpositions of such eigenstates ) , given by eq.([wavefn2 ] ) , this turned out to be a formidable task . instead , to examine the role of excitations which do not form minimum uncertainty packets , we consider the following wavefunction , which is a superposition of @xmath25 wavefunctions , each of which signifies _ exactly _ one oscillator in the first excited state . _ _ 1(x_1  x_n ) & = & _ i=1^n a_i n_i h_1 ( k_d i^ x_i )   + = & & ( a^t k_d^ x )  _ 0 ( x_1,  ,x_n , ) where @xmath54 , and normalisation requires @xmath55 . the density matrix can be written as : ( x ; x ) = 2 _ i=1^n dx_i _ 0 ( x_i ; x ) _ 0^(x_i ; x )  .",
    "this can be evaluated _ exactly _ , yielding : ( x , x ) = _ 0(x , x ) where = u^t  k_d^  a  a^t  k_d^  u (    cc _ a & _ b + _ b^t & _ c    ) without further approximations , ( [ esden1 ] ) can not be factorised into @xmath43-particle density matrices . however , noting that @xmath56 in the above is a gaussian ( given by ( [ gsden ] ) ) , decaying virtually to zero beyond its few sigma limits , we check whether quantities @xmath57 , defined below , are small for any given @xmath58 matrix . that is , whether : _ 1 x_max^t _ x_max 1  ,   _ 2 x_max^t _ x_max   1 where x_max^t = ( ) ( 1,1 ,  )   corresponding to @xmath59 limits in the argument of @xmath56 .",
    "if both @xmath60 , then we can make the following approximation : 1 - ( x^t_x + x^t _",
    "x ) + x^t_x  , with which ( [ esden1 ] ) can be written as :   . the above being of the same form as the gaussian density matrix , but with shifted parameters",
    ", can be factorised once again into two particle density matrices , and the associated entanglement entropy can be evaluated .",
    "the rest of the computation is numerical ( done using matlab ) .",
    "we choose the following values for parameters : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 signifies the number of non - zero entries in the vector : @xmath63 for the above choice , it was seen that @xmath64  .",
    "we give the results of our computation in the form of relevant graphs .",
    "figure 2 shows the logarithm of the entropy for the gs and es for @xmath65 .",
    "we see that for the es , the entropy scales as @xmath66 , with lesser @xmath67 for higher @xmath62 .",
    "it is less than unity for any @xmath68 .",
    "the al does not seem to hold !    4.70 in    next , in figure 3 ,",
    "we plot @xmath69 vs @xmath70 for the gs as well as for various es and several @xmath26 .",
    "it is seen that for the gs , there is a peak at @xmath71 ( @xmath72-wave ) , followed by another one around @xmath73 , the degeneracy factor of @xmath45 being responsible for the latter , for es , the first peak shifts to @xmath74 , with the shift being greater for larger @xmath62 .",
    "the graphs do not show a second peak , although there seems to be an increase towards higher values of @xmath70 .",
    "thus , higher partial waves are seen to get excited with greater excitations .",
    "in this section , we address the question : where are the dof , which give rise to entanglement entropy for black holes ?    to this end , we re - consider the interaction matrix @xmath75 in ( [ mat1 ] ) , and set to zero , _ by hand _",
    ", the interaction ( off - diagonal ) elements except for a small window ( of say size @xmath76 ) , and move the window from the origin through the horizon , to the outer edge of the spherical box , as shown below :    k = (    lllllll & & & & & & + & & & & & & + & & & & & & + & & & | & &  | & + & & & | & & | & + & & & | & & | & + & & & & & & +    )    with the above modified matrix , now we compute the entanglement entropy , and plot it as a function of the position of the centre of the window ( the green dotted boxes ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure 4 ( the solid red curve ) .",
    "note that when the window lies entirely outside or inside the hrizon , the entropy is zero .",
    "when the window just enters the horizon , the entropy starts to rise , and when it is symmetrically placed between the inside and outside , the entropy rises to @xmath77% of its value , and decreases again as it is further moved .",
    "the above results confirm the intuition that entanglement between inside and outside the horizon is the source of this entropy , and shows how it rises from zero to its maximum value as the entangled dof are gradually incorporated .",
    "2.70 in    in figure 5 , we probe this further , by keeping one extremity of the window just outside the horizon , while increasing its width from zero to the horizon radius . we see that with a width of one lattice spacing , about @xmath78 of the total entropy is obtained , and within a width of about @xmath79 lattice spacings , it reaches @xmath80 .",
    "while this shows that most of the entropy comes from dof very close to the horizon , a small part ( about @xmath81 in this case ) , has its origin deeper inside .",
    "the latter is understood to indirectly affect the dof near the boundary via the nearest - neighbour terms in ( [ mat1 ] ) .",
    "we expect a similar analysis for es to give us a better understanding of the scaling of the entropy with area in that case .    2.70 in",
    "in this section , we generalise the framework of our calculations , so that they are applicable to black hole spacetimes .",
    "we start with the schwarzschild metric with a horizon at @xmath82 : ds^2 = -f(r ) dt^2 + + r^2 d^2  ,  f(r)= 1 - and define the following coordinate transformation from @xmath83 to @xmath84 coordinates : =",
    "t + r_0  ,   r = +  ,   r = ^ r_0^  , such that ( [ sch1 ] ) transforms to the following metric , in _ lemaitre coordinates _ : ds^2= -d^2 + + ^r_0^  d^2  .",
    "the hamiltonian for a free scalar field in the above spacetime can be written as : .",
    "generalisation to any @xmath85 is straightforward . ]",
    "next , choose a _ fixed _ lemaitre time , say @xmath86 and perform the following field redefinitions : ( r ) = _ 1(r )  ,  ( r ) =  .",
    "then , at that _ fixed time _ , the hamiltonian ( [ schham ] ) transforms to : h(0 ) = _ 0^dr  .",
    "note that this is identical to the hamiltonian in flat spacetime , eq.([ham2 ] ) .",
    "also , it follows from eq.([transfn1 ] ) that the horizon now corresponds to @xmath87 .",
    "thus , one is free to trace over either the region @xmath88 or over the region @xmath89 , and all our results go through for a fixed @xmath90 .",
    "once again , the al holds for gs , cs and ss , while it does not for es .",
    "we also show that although the degrees of freedom near the horizon contribute most to the entropy , the dof deep inside must also be taken into account for the al .",
    "in this article , we have shown that entanglement between dof inside and outside the horizon is a viable source of black hole entropy . however , while the al holds for the gs , cs , and ss , this entropy scales as an area power less than unity , when the considered wavefunction is a superposition of first es . furthermore , while the dof near the horizon contribute most to the entropy , those farther away give a small contribution as well .",
    "we would like to investigate this further for es , as that might provide a physical understanding of the deviation from the al .",
    "we would also like understand the phhenomena of hawking radiation and information loss in this icture .",
