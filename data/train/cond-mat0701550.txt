    "models of random networks and surfaces have received extensive attention in statistical physics and field theory due to their wealth of applications in such diverse fields as the modelling of the internet @xcite , spin glass physics @xcite and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the diversity of applications is reflected in a rather large variety of different graph models considered .",
    "generic random graph and network models include the most general erds - rnyi model of @xmath0 bonds distributed randomly between pairs selected from @xmath1 vertices , as well as the barabsi - albert graphs constructed with the preferential attachment rule or the watts - strogatz method of interpolating between a regular lattice and a random graph via rewiring of links @xcite .",
    "these constructions result in variable , but _ uncorrelated _ vertex degrees with graph ensembles fully defined by the co - ordination number distribution @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "fixed - degree or @xmath3-regular random graphs have also been considered , which are equivalent to the non - planar or `` thin '' @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 feynman diagrams of a zero - dimensional field theory @xcite .",
    "while none of these networks feature a well - defined topology allowing for a local geometrical interpretation , a fattening of the thin graph propagators to ribbons yields orientable faces , enabling an interpretation of the graphs as random surfaces of fixed genus .",
    "the resulting dynamical triangulations model has been thoroughly studied with matrix model and combinatorial methods in the context of euclidean quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the topological constraint induces spatial correlations in the degree distribution , and the ensemble of graphs is no longer fully determined by @xmath2 .",
    "other ensembles of random graphs of well - defined topology have been studied , for instance the poissonian vorono - delaunay tessellations resulting from a generalisation of the crystallographic wigner - seitz construction to randomly distributed generators @xcite .",
    "a lot of effort has been invested in understanding the generic geometrical properties of these graph ensembles . in particular , for the network - type models dynamical properties have been regularly considered , such as the emergence of a giant component as edges are successively added to the graphs @xcite . for the delaunay and dynamical tessellations with a well - defined topology , genuinely geometrical attributes such as the fractal or hausdorff dimension and the correlation function of the local degrees have been of most interest @xcite . as an alternative to direct investigations",
    ", these ensembles might be characterised by observing the cooperative behaviour of matter variables such as classical ising spins @xmath7 with hamiltonian @xmath8 or more general potts or o(@xmath0 ) spins placed on the graph vertices , assuming ferromagnetic couplings @xmath9 .",
    "this exercise is also of interest from the inverted point - of - view of studying the effect of these various types of connectivity disorder on the spin models , being complementary to the canonical case of weak disorder from randomness of the couplings on regular lattices @xcite .",
    "graphs without topological constraint are inherently non - local and thus effectively infinite - dimensional .",
    "consequently , one expects mean - field phase transitions for the ferromagnetic models .",
    "these are indeed found for the erds - rnyi and @xmath3-regular ( or thin ) random graphs @xcite , transforming them into convenient alternatives to treatments on the bethe lattice or the complete graph , not encumbered with boundary effects .",
    "more generally , degree distributions with divergent moments can lead to interesting deviations from mean - field behaviour @xcite .",
    "the effects on surface - like graphs are less homogeneous . for ( uncorrelated )",
    "bond disorder , the celebrated harris criterion @xcite predicts a change of critical behaviour for cases with a positive specific - heat exponent @xmath10 .",
    "an analogous criterion can be formulated for random graphs , taking into account the spatial correlation of the degree distribution @xcite .",
    "the predicted change in universality class for virtually all types of matter coupled to dynamical triangulations or fat graphs is in agreement with exact results for percolation @xcite and numerical investigations of the ising and potts models @xcite . for vorono - delaunay tessellations ,",
    "however , the predicted change of universality class for models with @xmath11 such as the two - dimensional @xmath12 , @xmath13 potts and three - dimensional ising models is not observed numerically @xcite .",
    "it is an open problem why , instead , these models behave according to their regular lattice critical exponents .    in contrast to this weak - disorder case , the effect of connectivity disorder on models with _",
    "interactions is much more profound .",
    "the existence of odd - length loops on many of the graphs discussed leads to severe geometric frustration with the possibility of altogether precluding the onset of a long - range ordered phase .",
    "interestingly , however , this problem for random graphs has received very little attention to date @xcite , such that the behaviour of , e.g. , the ising antiferromagnet for the various cases is unclear .",
    "the effect of tuning the amount of frustration on a _ regular _ lattice has been considered in ref .   for the @xmath14 ising model on the triangular lattice , where it was found that a spin - glass phase appears as the concentration @xmath15 of antiferromagnetic bonds is increased from zero and disappears again as the system comes close to the perfect frustration of the pure antiferromagnet .",
    "some use has been made of @xmath3-regular or thin random graphs as an alternative realisation of the mean - field limit of spin glasses @xcite , and in general one expects the perfect frustration of the effectively infinite - dimensional graphs of the non - topological type to lead to mean - field spin - glass behaviour for the antiferromagnet .",
    "the less extreme case of fixed - topology graphs is the subject of the present study .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : frust ] discusses the general problem of frustration exerted by graphs of the dynamical triangulations type on antiferromagnets and the annealed and quenched limits for the ising antiferromagnet coupled to different graph types .",
    "the results of monte carlo simulations for the annealed case are discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zero ] , we investigate the quenched limit by means of exact ground - state computations in the framework of a defect - wall calculation , comparing gaussian and bimodal spin glasses to the antiferromagnet .",

    "[ cols= \" > , > , > \" , ]     dynamical triangulations originate in the discrete approach to euclidean quantum gravity via a path - integral quantisation of the gravitational interaction .",
    "the integral over metrics is regularised by a sum over combinatorial manifolds or simplicial complexes @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the case of two dimensions , where this amounts to a sum over all possible gluings of equilateral triangles to closed , orientable surfaces of a given , for instance planar or toroidal , topology .",
    "graphs of this type are hence constructed by taking a number @xmath16 of equilateral triangles and connecting them together along their edges at random , such that the resulting graph represents a closed and orientable surface of well - defined topology . in a computer simulation",
    ", such graphs can be implemented by the successive application of the `` link - flip '' move depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi3_move ] to the graph starting , e.g. , from a regular hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the geometric duals of these triangulations naturally are graphs of fixed degree @xmath17 , known as planar @xmath4 feynman diagrams in field theory .",
    "the planarity constraint necessitates a `` fattening '' of the usual propagators to ribbons , such that this type of diagrams is often refered to as `` fat graphs '' @xcite . instead of triangles , one can , of course , consider more general elementary polygons , such as the quadrangulations constructed from gluings of squares , whose duals are then consequently `` fat '' @xmath5 graphs etc .",
    "the resulting combinatorial problem of counting these discrete surfaces can be solved exactly for various cases using a matrix - model formulation @xcite or alternative combinatorial approaches @xcite .",
    "geometrically , the most striking result is that of an unusually large internal hausdorff dimension @xmath18 for these topologically two - dimensional surfaces @xcite , resulting from a structure of `` baby universes '' connected to the main graph body with a minimal number of links ( `` bottlenecks '' ) .",
    "this fractal structure is apparent from the example graph embedding shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] : while the graphs themselves are , by construction , defined in a purely intrinsic manner , without reference to an embedding into external space , an approximate embedding to some extent observing the constraint of equal edge lengths can be constructed to visualise the internal geometry @xcite .",
    "the distribution @xmath2 of co - ordination numbers is found to fall off exponentially @xcite and hence does not exhibit the fat tails found in small - world networks .",
    "however , the structure of the graphs is not solely determined by @xmath2 , since the well - defined topology introduces long - range correlations in the co - ordination numbers , declining as @xmath19 at large separations @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite     triangles embedded into euclidean space . note that the equilaterality requirement for the triangles is only approximately fulfilled since an exact embedding into @xmath21 is not guaranteed to exist.[fig : snapshot],width=264 ]      when coupling matter variables to the graphs , averages have to be performed for the fluctuations of the graphs as well as those of the coupled spins with associated characteristic time scales @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the _ annealed _ case of @xmath24 is the situation considered in the context of matter coupled to quantum gravity .",
    "since spin and disorder degrees - of - freedom fluctuate on the same time scales , the total free energy of the system is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the partition function for spins on a fixed graph @xmath27 and @xmath28 symbolises the average over the considered graph ensemble .",
    "hence , the effect of geometric randomness on the behaviour of spins is augmented by a _",

    "@xmath31 ) can be treated analytically ( in the regime where they show continuous phase transitions on regular lattices , i.e. , for @xmath32 resp.@xmath33 ) . in these cases , the coupling to dynamical triangulations results in a shift of universality class .",
    "more generally , in the framework of liouville theory , the dressing of conformal weights @xmath34 of critical matter coupled to two - dimensional quantum gravity is predicted to be @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the central charge @xcite .",
    "the resulting critical exponents agree with the exact results discussed above , and the predictions for a number of cases have been confirmed by numerical simulation studies , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "coupling _ antiferromagnets _ to this type of random graphs leads to strong frustration @xcite due to the presence of loops of odd length . depending on the exact type of graphs considered",
    ", however , the annealed average to some extent allows for the geometry to adapt to the antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "in particular , consider an ising antiferromagnet according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ising_hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath37 for all bonds , coupled to the following dynamical graphs :    * * triangulations * : here , all elementary faces of the graph are frustrated , and the frustration can not be relieved by a dynamic response of the lattice .",
    "as has been shown by wannier @xcite , the ising antiferromagnet on a _ regular _ triangular lattice remains paramagnetic down to zero temperature where , due to frustration , the system has a finite residual entropy .",
    "it is clear that for any planar triangulation ( whether regular or random ) configurations of minimal energy have two satisfied and one broken bond in each triangle .",
    "a large number of such states exists already for the triangular lattice , which is a member of the ensemble of dynamical triangulations considered .",
    "the freedom of changing spin configurations without leaving the ground - state manifold is found to be local , offering no energetic reward and thus precluding long - range order .",
    "in fact , the residual , zero - temperature entropy of this model has been calculated @xcite to be @xmath38 , to be compared to the value @xmath39 found for the triangular antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "* * quadrangulations * : any planar quadrangulation is bipartite  it can not contain any loops of odd length since all loops are composed of the elementary faces of length four .",
    "this structure allows for a two - colouring of the lattice vertices in , say , black and white sites .",
    "introducing extra ( non - fluctuating ) signs @xmath40 at the vertices and performing a mattis transformation as @xcite @xmath41 leaves the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ising_hamiltonian ] ) and thus the partition function invariant .",
    "choosing @xmath42 for the white and @xmath43 for the black vertices maps the system identically to the ising ferromagnet with @xmath44 .",
    "hence , for the random lattice the results of refs .",

    "bipartite graphs occur in both ensembles . hence the ground states of either system are perfectly nel ordered configurations , and it is reasonable to expect long - range order to persist for some finite range of temperatures .     of the ising antiferromagnet coupled to annealed fat @xmath4 graphs with @xmath45 up to @xmath46 vertices.,width=264 ]    to investigate this last case of a non - trivial interaction between geometric frustration and antiferromagnetism",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulations of the coupled system for graph sizes of @xmath47 up to @xmath48 vertices .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , we indeed find the emergence of antiferromagnetic nel order with signatures of a phase transition at rather low temperatures @xmath49 , cf .",
    "the susceptibility data shown in fig .  [ fig : annealed_susc ] .",
    "this temperature is to be compared with the phase transition at @xmath50 found for the ising _ ferromagnet _ on the `` fat '' @xmath4 graphs without self - energy and tadpole insertions considered here @xcite .",
    "we find the specific heat to be completely independent of system size with a broad peak around @xmath51 , cf .",
    "[ fig : cv ] , and no crossing of the binder parameter within the temperature range @xmath52 considered .",
    "these findings , together with the apparent scaling of the susceptibility on the low - temperature side of the peak seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : annealed_susc ] , hint at the presence of a critical ( low - temperature ) phase with an associated kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is further supported by the very slow convergence of effective critical temperatures as the system size is increased , compatible with a logarithmic rather than a power - law approach .",
    "a series of simulations for the _ ferromagnet _ on the same lattices performed for comparison , on the other hand , yields @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , perfectly compatible with the exact results @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the antiferromagnetic transition can be understood from an inspection of the distribution @xmath2 of loop lengths : as the temperature is lowered , the ising antiferromagnet forces all odd - length loops out of the system , leading to surfaces completely composed out of faces of even length , i.e. , squares , hexagons , octagons etc .",
    "[ fig : annealed_coord ] .",
    "thus , the back - reaction of the antiferromagnetic matter on the graphs drives them into a non - frustrating phase of bipartite graphs compatible with nel order .",
    "the resulting strong coupling between graphs and matter throughout the whole low - temperature region could plausibly give rise to a critical phase with associated infinite - order phase transition as implied by the simulation results discussed above .",
    "this is in contrast to the ising ferromagnet , where strong interaction between matter and geometry is confined to the vicinity of the critical point .     of the ising antiferromagnet coupled to annealed fat @xmath4 graphs from monte carlo simulations.,width=264 ]",
    "the ( graph-)quenched limit @xmath56 of averages describes the case usually encountered in condensed matter physics , where impurities or lattice defects are fixed properties of the sample .",
    "consequently , the average over disorder should be performed at the level of observable quantities , such as the free energy and its derivatives , leading to @xmath57 this interchange of logarithm and disorder average as compared to the annealed limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : annealed ] ) often leads to dramatically different properties .",
    "unfortunately , no exact prediction for ferromagnets in the spirit of ( [ dressing_kpz ] ) is available here .",
    "since it is believed that ferromagnets with weak quenched disorder in two dimensions in general are related to conformal field theories with central charge @xmath58 , an approximation starting from the kpz / ddk framework could be derived from eq .",
    "( [ dressing_kpz ] ) by setting @xmath58 there @xcite , i.e. , @xmath59 this form can also be more directly motivated by noting that the central charge of @xmath0 replicas of matter variables is additive , such that the limit @xmath60 of the replica trick naturally leads to a central charge @xmath58 in ( [ dressing_kpz ] ) @xcite .",
    "these predictions can not be confronted with any exact solutions .",
    "monte carlo simulations for the ising and potts ferromagnets on quenched dynamical triangulations @xcite show a change in universality class , in agreement with the adapted relevance criterion for connectivity disorder discussed above @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents , however , although changed from their regular - lattice values , in general seem not to be correctly predicted by the form ( [ kpz_quenched ] ) .     of loop lengths of annealed , fat @xmath4 random graphs coupled to an ising antiferromagnet in the high - temperature phase at @xmath61 and deep in the ordered phase at @xmath62 .",
    "data for graphs with @xmath63 vertices.,width=264 ]    for the antiferromagnets , frustration from quenched , fat graphs is potentially stronger than in the annealed case : the frozen - in disorder of the graphs can not adapt to alleviate the energy cost of odd - length loops .",
    "as before , the degree of frustration exerted on the ising antiferromagnet depends on the ensemble of graphs considered :    * * triangulations * : following the argumentation presented above , the system is paramagnetic at all temperatures for each fixed random triangulation .",
    "consequently , the quenched average merely describes the modulation of a completely disordered system . *",
    "* quadrangulations * : the perfect bipartiteness of the graphs is not affected by the process of the disorder average . via the described mattis transformation , the system is identical to the ising ferromagnet on quenched quadrangulations . by universality",
    ", the critical behaviour is expected to be that of the ising ferromagnet on quenched fat @xmath4 graphs studied in ref .  .",
    "* * @xmath4 or @xmath5 graphs * : this graph ensemble features a broad distribution of odd - length loops exerting strong frustration on the coupled antiferromagnet .",
    "the lack of a back - reaction of the ising spins on the underlying graphs prevents the suppression of loops of odd length observed in the annealed limit .",
    "the bipartite graph configurations selected in the low - temperature phase of the latter only occur with vanishing weight in the quenched average .",
    "this appears to preclude the emergence of long - range order at finite temperatures .",
    "however , the frozen - in frustration might give rise to _ spin - glass order _ at zero temperature .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to an investigation of the possibility of such spin - glass order for the ising antiferromagnet on quenched fat @xmath4 graphs .",
    "due to the random distribution of faces of odd ( frustrated ) and even ( unfrustrated ) lengths , it is natural to suspect that the ising antiferromagnet on @xmath4 fat graphs behaves similarly to a @xmath14 edwards - anderson spin glass on the same lattices .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear , however , whether the long - range correlation of co - ordination numbers @xcite might cause any non - universal differences between these cases . how can the appearance of spin glass be detected and its properties determined ?",
    "generalising peierls argument for the stability of an ordered phase , a droplet - scaling theory for the spin - glass phase can be formulated @xcite .",
    "the role of the droplet surface ( free ) energy is then taken on by the _ width _",

    "in the course of renormalisation , @xmath64 scales as @xmath66 , defining the _ spin stiffness exponent _ @xmath67 .",
    "if the system scales to weak coupling , @xmath68 , spin - glass order is unstable at finite temperature and the system is below its lower critical dimension , with @xmath67 describing the properties of the _ critical _ point at temperature @xmath69 . on the other hand , @xmath70 indicates stability of a spin - glass phase at finite temperature .",
    "numerically , the domain - wall free energy can be determined from the energy difference between ground states of systems with different types of boundary conditions ( bcs ) chosen such as to induce a relative domain wall @xcite .      following this programme ,",
    "one requires the generation of a number of statistically independent graph realisations for performing the quenched average .",
    "subsequently , for each realisation ground states of the ising antiferromagnet should be calculated .",
    "an ergodic set of graph updates for dynamical triangulations ( and the dual @xmath4 graphs ) is given by the so - called pachner moves @xcite , which we employ to generate independent realisations of toroidal topology , starting out from a perfect hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "such a toroidal shape is needed to induce excited states by a change of boundary conditions as indicated above .",
    "the monte carlo equilibration is done for closed graphs , leaving the task of identifying appropriate loops along which to cut them open .",
    "several possibilities come to mind :    * in the original hexagonal lattice , the identification of boundaries is obvious . if , by construction , no link - flip updates are performed on the links crossing a boundary , the toroidal cuts are _ fixed _ in the equilibrated graphs .",
    "this simplicity , however , comes at the expense of strong boundary effects : due to the large fractal dimension @xcite @xmath71 , each vertex is comparatively closer to one of the boundaries than would be expected for a two - dimensional system . * allowing flips of links crossing a boundary , one might keep track of the induced evolution of the boundary loops .",
    "this turns out to be rather involved , in particular due to the appearance of self - intersections of the meandering boundary lines .",
    "consequently , we have not considered this approach for the final ground - state computations .",
    "* ideally , the graph generation should employ periodic boundary conditions preventing surface effects with the graphs being `` cut open '' once equilibrated .",
    "this amounts to the identification of topologically inequivalent elementary loops on the surface .",
    "it is not immediately obvious , however , how such an optimal _ homotopy _ basis could be computed for an intrinsic graph structure .    , width=226 ]    as it turns out , a number of computational problems related to topologically motivated cuttings of surfaces are _ np_-hard . in particular , identification of the so - called `` cut graph '' whose removal renders a surface topologically trivial , i.e. , the locus of all points with at least two shortest paths from a given base point , is a non - polynomial problem @xcite .",
    "rather surprisingly , however , a homotopy basis of minimum length in form of a system of loops joint in a common base point _ can _ be computed in polynomial time @xcite .",
    "such a system consists of @xmath72 simple loops ( where @xmath73 is the genus of the surface ) , whose complement in the manifold is a topological disk .",
    "this decomposition proceeds with a variant of the tree - cotree decomposition proposed in ref .  :",
    "starting from a marked base point on a planar surface , the dual complement of a spanning tree is a spanning tree as well , cf .",
    "[ fig : trees ] .",
    "for non - trivial topology , however , by euler s formula both trees simply do not have enough edges to cover the whole graph , and it is easily seen that the edges not touched by either tree are those defining the topologically non - trivial loops with respect to the base point . a set of _ minimal _ loops can then be found by computing the tree @xmath74 of shortest paths in the graph @xmath75 and the maximum spanning tree @xmath76 in the complement @xmath77 , where the weight of each dual edge @xmath78 is chosen to be the length of the shortest loop in @xmath75 containing the base point as well as the edge @xmath79 .",
