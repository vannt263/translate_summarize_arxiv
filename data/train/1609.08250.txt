    "magnetization dynamics and electron transport are coupled together in a reciprocal manner .",
    "their interplay introduces a variety of feedback phenomena  @xcite . for example , when a background magnetization varies slowly over space and time , conduction electron spins will follow the magnetization orientation . by doing so",
    ", the electron wave function acquires a geometric phase changing with time , which behaves as a time - varying magnetic flux and produces a spin motive - force ( smf ) according to faraday s effect  @xcite . as a feedback , electrons driven by the smf",
    "react on the magnetization via the spin - transfer torque ( stt )  @xcite .",
    "this reaction leads to a modified magnetic damping , which hinders the magnetization dynamics that generates the smf  @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "when a magnetic texture is driven into motion by a current , it in turn exerts smfs on the electrons , resulting in a modified electrical resistivity that inhibits the growth of the driving current  @xcite .",
    "similar feedback mechanisms also apply to magnetic heterostructures  @xcite . for example , spin current pumped from a precessing ferromagnet into an adjacent normal metal experiences a backflow , which , in turn acts on the ferromagnet through stt  @xcite .",
    "because of the backflow - induced stt , the effective spin - mixing conductance on the interface is renormalized  @xcite .",
    "if the pumped spin current is absorbed by a second ferromagnet instead of flowing back , it will mediate a dynamical interlayer coupling between the two ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has also been shown that in the presence of the spin hall effect , spin pumping and spin - backflow are connected through a feedback loop due to the combined effect of the spin hall and its reverse process  @xcite .",
    "this novel feedback mechanism , despite quadratic in the spin hall angle , gives rise to a crucial nonlinear damping effect that qualitatively changes the dynamical behavior of the magnetization .    in electromagnetics ,",
    "a negative feedback is ensured by the lenz law  @xcite , which requires that the emf generated by faraday s effect must oppose the change of magnetic flux that causes the emf .",
    "for instance , an electric motor works simultaneously as a dynamotor so that the induced emf counteracts the applied emf . as a result ,",
    "the electric current flowing through its coil is attenuated and the resistance from @xmath2 measurement is larger than the resistance of the coil . in the context of spintronics ,",
    "the current - induced magnetization dynamics plays the role of an electric motor , which in turn drives the current in a similar fashion as a dynamotor .",
    "regarding the lenz law , one may expect an increased resistivity .    in this paper",
    ", however , we show that this naive expectation is not always correct .",
    "the feedback acting on the driving current can also give rise to a reduced resistivity .",
    "as an example , we study the current - driven domain wall ( dw ) dynamics in a nanowire with cylindrical symmetry  @xcite , and demonstrate that when the dw is set into motion by an applied current , its reaction in the form of smf can either propel or repel the electron motion , creating either a negative or a positive dw resistance .",
    "the sign of the dw resistance reflects the style of the feedback , which depends only on two phenomenological parameters  the gilbert damping constant @xmath1 and the strength of the dissipative torque @xmath0 . to interpret such an anomalous feedback phenomenon",
    ", we make an analogy to the working mechanism of a water turbine . it is observed that if a dw propels electrons along with its motion , just like a rotating turbine wheel carriers water , a negative dw resistance is produced .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ feedback ] , we establish the general formalism . in sec .  [ spintexture ] , we apply the formalism to a slowly - varying spin texture and derive the feedback - induced change of dissipations . in section  [ dw ]",
    ", we explore the current - driven dw dynamics in a cylindrically symmetric nanowire , and derive the dw resistance in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in section  [ disc ] , we provide an intuitive interpretation of the anomalous feedback .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] , the interplay between local magnetization and conduction electrons is resolved in a dynamic feedback loop connecting energy dissipation channels of each individual process . under the adiabatic assumption  @xcite",
    ", we regard the magnetic order parameter @xmath3 as a slowly - varying vector in space and time so that conduction electron spins are able to adjust to the magnetization direction .",
    "given the magnetic free energy @xmath4 $ ] , we define the effective magnetic field as @xmath5 . in the diffusive region ,",
    "nonlocal processes are suppressed , and the coupled dynamics of the system is described by    [ eq : couple ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath8 is the magnetic damping tensor , @xmath9 is the conductivity tensor .",
    "the stt @xmath10 and the motive force @xmath11 are _ local _ functions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ; they mix the dynamics of @xmath14 with that of electrons .",
    "note that @xmath10 and @xmath11 may also depend on the spatial gradient of the magnetization @xmath15 . with proper initial conditions ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath14 and @xmath12 can be solved by iterations of eq .   on discretized spacetime grid .",
    "at any particular point @xmath16 , one is allowed to eliminate @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 ) by substituting eq .   into eq .   [ or eq .   into eq .  ]",
    "if both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are local functions of the space and time coordinates .",
    "such an elimination operation fulfills the feedback loop illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] .",
    "for example , if @xmath17 , the current @xmath12 is only induced by the motion of @xmath14 through @xmath11 , which is simultaneously reacting on @xmath14 by virtue of @xmath10 . in this regard",
    ", we can eliminate @xmath12 by inserting eq .   into eq .  , which modifies the magnetic damping tensor @xmath8 .",
    "in a parallel sense , if the magnetization dynamics is solely driven by @xmath12 ( no magnetic field ) , it also generates a feedback on @xmath12 and renormalizes the conductivity tensor @xmath18 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the elimination of @xmath13 by inserting eq .   into eq .  .",
    "the dynamic feedback effects can be further elucidated by energy dissipations .",
    "swapping the roles of the thermodynamic forces @xmath19 and @xmath20 with the corresponding currents @xmath13 and @xmath12  @xcite , we can rewrite eq .   as @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is pertaining to the gilbert damping , @xmath23 the current - induced torque , @xmath24 the motive force , and @xmath25 the electrical resistivity",
    "the onsager s reciprocity relation implies that @xmath26  @xcite . if magnetization and current decouple , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath27 , the magnetic free energy dissipates only through the gilbert damping @xmath28 , while the electron free energy dissipates only through the joule heating @xmath29 .",
    "however , when the stt ( @xmath23 ) and the motive force ( @xmath24 ) are introduced , a feedback loop will connect the two channels of energy dissipation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] . for example",
    ", the magnetic dissipation is implemented by not only the gilbert damping , but also the joule heating , since a magnetic precession inevitably drives the electron motion that carries away the magnetic energy and subsequently dissipates into heat .",
    "this manifests as a renormalization of the magnetic damping tensor @xmath8 ( thus @xmath22 ) . in a similar fashion ,",
    "electron current can excite magnetic precession , which takes away the electron kinetic energy and damped into heat through the gilbert damping . as a result ,",
    "the resistivity tensor @xmath25 is effectively modified .",
    "the rates of free energy loss are thus    [ eq : l1122 ] @xmath30\\dot{\\bm{m}}\\equiv-\\mathcal{l}_{11}\\dot{\\bm{m}}^2 , \\\\      \\dot{\\mathcal{u}}_e&=-\\bm{j}\\left[l_{22}-l_{21}l_{11}^{-1}l_{12}\\right]\\bm{j}\\equiv-\\mathcal{l}_{22}\\bm{j}^2 ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the response coefficients modified by the dynamic feedback .    in general ,",

    "we mention that eq .",
    "is quite general , where the thermodynamic forces ( or currents ) can be magnetic , electric , thermalic , _",
    "etc_. however , to simplify the following discussions , we do not include any thermoelectric effect , although they may become important in many circumstances  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a spacetime dependent magnetization @xmath3 drives local spin currents via the smf .",
    "the smf that exerts on spin - up electrons is opposite to its counterpart that exerts on spin - down electrons : @xmath45 , where the spin direction is determined with respect to the local and instantaneous @xmath3 .",

    "the term proportional to @xmath0 is the dissipative smf  @xcite , which is the reciprocal effect of the dissipative stt ; @xmath0 is a phenomenological constant that characterizes the relative strengths of the dissipative contribution .    as a feedback effect ,",

    "@xcite , the underlying physics is fundamentally distinct . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the damping renormalization is attributed to the current - induced noise , and thermal fluctuation is the primary stimulus .",

    "( 2 ) these dws are massless and the critical currents required to initiate their motions are zero . because of the latter property",

    "the second term of eq .   is ascribed to the dynamic feedback effect , which scales inversely with @xmath90 . since @xmath100",

    "the dynamical correction of the dw resistance is positive for @xmath105 , and negative for @xmath106 . using typical material parameters of permalloy ,",
    "the feedback - induced resistance of a 100 nm wide dw with @xmath10730nm@xmath108 is in the range of @xmath109 to @xmath110 @xmath111 .",
    "a negative dw resistance indicates that the feedback exerting on the electrons by the dw is positive . to be specific , when the dw is set into motion by a current , it propels the electrons in their direction of motion , thus reducing the electrical resistance . in terms of the lenz law",
    ", this means that the smf induction enhances the flux ( geometric phase ) change by making the electrons more mobile , contrasting to the normal case where the smf opposes the flux change .",
    "it worths emphasizing that such an anomalous situation is unique to cylindrically symmetric nanowires , while nanostrips are not applicable as the approximation @xmath75 is invalid .",
    "as a function of the angular velocity @xmath112 signals the nature of the feedback effect . ]",
    "different from the static dw resistance  @xcite that is absorbed by @xmath113 in our theory , the feedback - induced dw resistance is associated with the dw dynamics .",
    "the peculiarity of using a cylindrical nanowire is that the threshold current to initiate the dw dynamics is technically zero  @xcite .",
    "so , what we mean by dw resistance refers to the difference in @xmath114 when comparing the results of @xmath2 measurements between a freely moving dw and a pinned dw on identical cylindrical nanowires under the same voltage drop .",
    "the key to understand why such difference is negative for @xmath115 lies in the reaction smf that propels the electrons along the direction of the dw motion .",
    "it contradicts the case of an electric motor where the back emf induction opposes the driving current and raises the system resistance . at the same time , we need to justify that such an anomalous feedback effect does not violate any fundamental physical law . to this end",
    ", we make a heuristic analogy between the current - induced dw dynamics in cylindrical nanowires and a water turbine with constant pump , where the rotating wheel represents our moving dw .",
    "in fact , the linear velocity of the dw is proportional to its angular velocity , and their ratio is independent of the current  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is equivalent to characterize the dw motion by its angular velocity , which is more transparent to compare with a turbine wheel .",
    "drawing such an analogy is to show that a negative resistance is not surprising , while the analogy itself is by no means exact .    as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : machine ] , the working mechanism of a water turbine is compared with an electric motor .",
    "they have one thing in common : the steady - state angular velocity @xmath112 increases with decreasing load .",
    "so by controlling the load , one can tune @xmath112 in both cases .",
    "however , the feedback mechanisms in the two cases are remarkably different . in an electric motor ,",
    "if one raises @xmath112 by reducing the load , the back emf induced by faraday s effect will get larger , which counteracts the applied voltage more strongly and reduces the overall current .",
    "consequently , the resistance read off from the @xmath2 curve increases .",
    "this realizes the usual negative feedback effect and respects the lenz law since @xmath116 decreases when the motor rotates faster . in sharp contrast , if one increases @xmath112 of a water turbine , the water flows more easily in the pipe as the turbine blades less block the water . as a result , the  resistance \" of the entire turbine system appears to be smaller .",
    "this feature marks an anomalous feedback : the water current increases when the turbine rotates faster . ignoring the mass and friction of the wheel , the maximum achievable angular velocity ( in the limit of zero load ) , hence the maximum water current ,",
    "is set by the water flow in the absence of the turbine .",
    "now go back to our dw dynamics : reducing the dw pinning corresponds to reducing the load on a water turbine , which enhances the driving current in just a similar way as the enhancement of water flow .",
    "finally , we comment on why the anomalous feedback is more likely to occur in one dimensions . since @xmath117 , the second term of eq .   dominates the first term , and its coefficient is unlikely to flip sign unless @xmath0 is greater than unity .",
    "however , in higher dimensions , the second term always exist , so the first term that could lead to the anomaly is suppressed .",
    "although the second term only refers to the transverse components of the transport , the boundary conditions on the edges can considerably complicate the effective value of the longitudinal component and obscure the observation .",

    "we now eliminate those cross terms @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) in terms of @xmath123 .",

    "<S> magnetic induction can be regarded as a negative feedback effect , where the motive - force opposes the change of magnetic flux that generates the motive - force . in artificial electromagnetics emerging from spintronics , </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not necessarily the case . by studying the current - induced domain wall dynamics in a cylindrical nanowire </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the spin motive - force exerting on electrons can either oppose or support the applied current that drives the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> the switching into the anomalous feedback regime occurs when the strength of the dissipative torque @xmath0 is about twice the value of the gilbert damping constant @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous feedback manifests as a negative domain wall resistance , which has an analogy with the water turbine . </S>"
