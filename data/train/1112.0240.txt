    "intersubband optical transitions in a semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) are widely used in a variety of modern optoelectronic devices operating in a broad wavelength range spanning from mid - infrared to terahertz .",
    "@xcite however , their practical realization needs high radiative quantum efficiency . in this context",
    "the implementation of the concepts of strong light - matter coupling is a promising tool to improve the functionality of the devices as compare to those operating in the weak - coupling regime . @xcite",
    "an achievement of the strong coupling is possible if the absorbing media is placed inside a photonic cavity and coherent light - matter coupling overcomes the dissipative processes in the system . for intersubband transitions",
    "the experimental realization of strong coupling regime was for the first time reported in the pioneering work of d. dini _ et al . _ @xcite the elementary excitations in this case have hybrid half - light half - matter nature and are called intersubband polaritons .",
    "they have a number of peculiarities distinguishing them from conventional cavity polaritons formed by interband excitons .",
    "first , they are formed only in tm polarization , as optical selection rules prohibit the absorption of the te mode in the intersubband transitions .",
    "second , the strength of the coupling can be an important fraction of the photon energy , which makes possible the transition to so - called ultrastrong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "the light - matter coupling constant and resulting rabi splitting depend on the geometry of the qw and photonic cavity and the electronic density in the lowest energy subband @xcite , which opens a possibility to tune this parameter by application of the external gate voltage .",
    "the broad variety of the applications of intersubband polaritonics makes important the understanding of the nature of intersubband polaritons .",
    "the question is : what kind of the elementary excitation in a qw is coupled with a photonic mode and participate in the formation of the polariton doublet ?",
    "the former can be devided into two categories : single - particle excitations ( spe ) and collective excitations , appearing from electron - electron interactions and absent in the non - interacting system .",
    "the earlier works devoted to theoretical description of the intersubband polaritons neglected coulomb interactions completely @xcite and the main qualitative conclusion was that the formation of the polaritons is a result of the coupling between non - interacting electron - hole pairs and a cavity mode .",
    "moreover , it was claimed that bosonization approach is valid for the description of unbounded fermion pairs .",
    "@xcite    the opinion that coulomb effects play no substantial role in the intersubband polaritonics seems controversial , as their important role in photoabsorption of individual qws ( in the absence of a photonic cavity ) is an established fact , studied extensively from both experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "@xcite electron - electron interactions lead to the appearance of the collective excitation modes such as intersubband plasmon ( isp ) which under certain conditions can give a dominant impact to the optical response .",
    "@xcite    the effects of many - particle interactions were revealed in the case of ultra - strongly coupled intersubband transition in 0d `` polaritonic dots '' .",
    "@xcite the emergent polariton gap in the case of ultra - strong coupling was explained using phenomenological model which includes depolarization shift .",
    "however , the consequences of coulomb interaction in broad concentration range were not studied .",
    "thus , the role of many - body correction for ordinary single quantum well remains uninvestigated .    in the current paper",
    "we address this question in details .",
    "we propose a semi - analytical way of the description of the coupling between intersubband excitations ( single - particle or collective ) to a cavity mode in terms of feynman diagrams corresponding to the different physical processes in the system .",
    "this makes our calculations transparent and allows a simple qualitative interpretation of the role of many body interactions in the considered system .",
    "moreover , since we sum up infinite series of the diagrams , our treatment is non - perturbative and includes all orders of the interaction .",
    "as well , it treats the resonant and anti - resonant terms in light - matter coupling hamiltonian on equal footing and thus allows the description of the phenomenon of ultra - strong coupling as well .",
    "we show theoretically that coulomb interactions play important role in the intersubband polaritonics , especially for high electron concentrations necessary for the achievement of strong coupling regime . we claim that in this case the intersubband polariton is formed due to the coupling of the collective excitation known as intersubband plasmon ( isp ) with the cavity mode . in the opposite case of small electron concentrations",
    "we show that excitonic corrections become crucial .",
    "we consider a system with gaas / algaas quantum well ( qw ) embedded into microcavity in the configuration usually used for intersubband transitions with tm polarized light ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](a , b ) ) .",
    "as our goal here is to present qualitative results and not to perform a fit of any experimental data , we do not consider the case where the photonic cavity contains several qws which is often used in order to obtain larger values of rabi splitting and necessary for the achievement of the ultra - strong coupling.@xcite our method , however , can be easily generalized for this configuration as well .",
    "we choose a doping of a single qw in such a way that only the lowest subband is filled by the electrons at @xmath0 while upper subbands remain empty ( fig .",

    ", the calculation of this quantity is a tricky task which can be performed only in some particular cases , which we are now going to consider .",
    "this case has a methodological interest and represents a test for our approach , allowing to compare the results it gives with those obtained earlier in the refs .",

    "it is instructive to consider the case @xmath35 and assume that the transferred momentum of photon @xmath36 is small as compare to the fermi momentum of the electron gas @xmath37 . in this case , the equation for the energies of the polariton modes ( [ poles ] ) reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes electron density in the fundamental subband and we define @xmath40 as electron occupation number .",
    "if we are outside the ultrastrong coupling regime ( @xmath41 ) this reduces to @xmath42 which is nothing but the equation for two coupled harmonic oscillators corresponding to a cavity mode and single - particle excitations in the qw .",
    "the dispersions of intersubband polaritons deduced from this equation coincide with those obtained in the earlier works [ ] .",
    "one should note that in the mean field ( hartree - fock ) approximation the electron - electron corrections can be easily introduced into consideration without substantial modification of the formalism .",
    "no new collective excitations appear in this approach and the results remain qualitatively the same as for the non - interacting case .",
    "we thus consider both situations in the same section .    in diagrammatic representation the hartree - fock approximation results into renormalization of electron green functions which can be described by the dyson equation shown in fig .",

    "first , the correction for populated fundamental subband is greater then for the empty upper subband leading to the alteration of the transition energy @xmath17 .",
    "accounting for the negative sign of exchange correction , one concludes that the effective gap @xmath54 is increased .",
    "second , in general the self - energy is a function of momentum which leads to the non - parabolicity of the renormalized dispersions and contributes to the broadening of the absorption line . for intersubband polaritons the first effect shifts the anticrossing point in the region of larger momenta ( several mev in the geometry we consider ) and second leads to the slight decrease of the observed rabi splitting .",
    "in general , the electron - electron interactions can not be neglected and @xmath55 and their account is a non - trivial task . however , the certain types of diagrams appear in different electron density limits and govern quasiparticle dynamics .",
    "for instance , in high electron concentration case ( @xmath56 ) the polarization operator can be estimated using random phase approximation ( rpa ) whose diagrammatic representation is shown in fig . [ fig3](c ) .",
