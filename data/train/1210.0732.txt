    "the problem of measuring the scientific excellence of research institutes and universities is one of current and continued importance @xcite .",
    "it is important to be able to detect and support the most promising research groups and to have sound and robust bases to wisely plan and invest for the future .",
    "metrics and indicators of scientific activity may be based on the volume of researchers , the number of published papers , the amount of citations to these publications , the number of phd students and on finances generated by application of scientific ideas , amongst other factors .",
    "it is often argued that automated scientometric or bibliometric indicators may be an inadequate substitute or proxy for peer - review based evaluations of the merit of research institutes @xcite .",
    "there is a lot of arguments against the use of indicators in isolation , suggesting they reflect only one aspect of the research and should only be used as an adjunct to peer review ( for example , see  @xcite ) .",
    "but in spite of the problems with indicators and metrics , reasonable and cheap approaches to the evaluation of scientific productivity and quality are desirable for practical purposes , not least because institutional peer review is an expensive and time - consuming exercise @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate `` absolute '' and `` specific '' measurements of scientific excellence on the scale of university research groups .",
    "e.g. , the _ absolute _ citation count for a department is the total number of citations , irrespective of how many researchers that department contains .",
    "the corresponding _ specific _ citation count is then the average number of citations per head ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in physics parlance these correspond respectively to the notions of `` extensive '' and `` intensive '' quantities and are usually represented mathematically by upper - case and lower - case symbols . that convention is borrowed here for absolute and specific measurements . in this paper",
    "we compare these specific and absolute notions of quality and strength with indicators of citation impact , to determine if the latter may be used as a reliable proxy for the former .",
    "we consider the overall _ strength _ of a research collective ( a university department , research centre , group or some variant , component or amalgam of these ) as measured through a peer - review evaluation scheme to be an absolute quantity and denote it by @xmath0 .",
    "a peer - review measure of the _ quality _ @xmath1 of a group of researchers is then the strength per head .",
    "similarly , the total citation impact @xmath2 is considered here as the absolute impact of research group while its average value @xmath3 ( calculated per head ) corresponds to specific impact .",
    "thus , `` absolute '' refers to total institutional measurements while `` specific '' means average properties per individual .",
    "we then define _ strength _ as `` volume of quality '' and _ absolute impact _ as `` volume of average impact '' .    in this paper , to make a quantitative comparison we use data from the british system of evaluation of research and education ( _ research assessment exercise _ ) and from _ evidence _ , a company within thomson reuters , one of the world s leading providers of scientific information . using biology research groups and departments in the uk as a test case ,",
    "we show that the citation - based measure @xmath3 is not a good proxy for the peer - review measure @xmath1 , in that these two specific measures are rather poorly correlated . however , when scaled up to the actual size of the department @xmath4 , the _ absolute _ citation impact @xmath5 is very strongly correlated with the overall strength @xmath6 as measured by peer review .",
    "( here and below @xmath4 means the number of researchers in group . )",
    "this means that citations , if used in an informed manner , could possibly be used as a proxy for departmental or group _ strength _ particularly for large groups , but should not be as an estimate of research _",
    "quality_. when applied to large research groups or departments in particular , this may offer an alternative or at least complement to peer review .",
    "for the last quarter century , the _ research assessment exercise _ ( rae ) provided the premier yardstick for the measurement of scientific performance of research institutions in united kingdom .",
    "this introduced an explicit and formalized process to assess the quality of research @xcite .",
    "six evaluation exercise have occurred since the first one in 1986 and evaluation frameworks of this type now constitute the single most important event in the uk research calender each five or so years . for the purpose of the 2008 exercise ,",
    "each academic discipline was assigned to one of 67 units of assessment ( uoa ) . in order to receive quality related funding any higher education institution ( hei )",
    "could make submissions to rae in any uoa .",
    "using published criteria , rae experts assess these submissions and generate graded profile for each of them .",
    "these profiles quantify the proportion of a department s or research centre s work which falls into each of five quality bands as follows  @xcite :    * 4 * : quality that is world - leading in terms of originality , significance and rigour ; * 3 * : quality that is internationally excellent in terms of originality , significance and rigour but which falls short of the highest standards of excellence ; * 2 * : quality that is recognised internationally in terms of originality , significance and rigour ; * 1 * : quality that is recognised nationally in terms of originality , significance and rigour ; * unclassified  quality that falls below the standard of nationally recognised work or work which does not meet the published definition of research for the purposes of the assessment .    an example of a quality profile is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "[ tab1 ]    @xmath7an overall quality profile is constructed by summing the three separate weighted components ( `` output '' , `` environment '' and `` esteem '' ) using a special cumulative rounding methodology which avoids unfair consequences that simple rounding can produce @xcite .    besides obvious benefits in terms of prestige , marketing and publicity potential , the research quality profiles determined how much funding each university department receives in the years following the exercise",
    "funding is determined by a formula combining the weighted quality scores of individual research group or centres .",
    "the formula is subject to regional and temporal variation , but the one introduced by the higher education funding council for england ( hefce ) immediately subsequent to rae 2008 was @xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 represents the percentage of a team s research which was rated @xmath10 and @xmath1 may be considered as a single _ specific _ measure of a university s overall research quality in a particular discipline .",
    "the total amount of quality related funding distributed by hefce to a given university post rae is proportional to the overall _ strength _ of the submission @xmath11 where @xmath4 is the number of researchers submitted from a given university .",
    "thus , strength @xmath0 is an _",
    "absolute _ measure of performance .    notwithstanding various managerial tactics and manoeuvres , the rae , and similar exercises in other countries ,",
    "is considered to be reasonably reliable since it is based on peer - review evaluation . despite its many drawbacks and limitations ,",
    "peer review is considered by the academic community at large to be the most reliable and trustworthy scheme to evaluate the worth of curiosity - driven research , in particular . on the other hand ,",
    "peer - review - based evaluation is expensive and time - consuming process .",
    "in addition , the very act of measuring the scientific system distorts the very process it purports to measure .",
    "this is goodhart s law , a type of socioeconomic counterpart of the heisenberg uncertainty principle in physics .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to propose some alternatives to the rae .",
    "evaluations based entirely upon citation counts are some of many possible candidate schemes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "some authors advocate substitution of the rae by citation counting due to claimed good correlation between the resultant rankings obtained @xcite .",
    "but there are also authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) who point to different weaknesses of citation analysis such as self - citing , bias , technical errors connected with citation data retrieval or different typical rates of citations for various disciplines .",
    "although methods have been , and are being , developed to try to deal with these phenomena , no universally satisfactory automated system has yet emerged .",
    "so , the question arises as to how good citation - based indicators can be as proxies for peer review . since the last uk exercise generated quality measurements in far more detail than previous raes , and since subsequent evaluation frameworks in the uk will amalgamate some of the uoa s used in 2008 into fewer , larger subject groupings , rae 2008 provides a window of great detail in which answers to this question may be sought . having precise numbers assigned to each institution for the 67 disciplines it is possible to perform accurate comparisons between rae peer - review evaluation and citation scores .",
    "thus we arrive at the main questions we wish to address herein : how do rae  2008 scores correlate with citation rates ?",
    "as already noticed before , to get the citation - based measure , we use the data provided by _",
    "this company offers a service analysing research performance tailored to individual client requirements @xcite .",
    "we consider the so - called _ normalised citation impact _",
    "( nci ) @xmath3 used by _ evidence _ as a coefficient of departmental performance in a given discipline . _",
    "evidence _ calculate the nci using data from thomson reuters databases @xcite .",
    "similarly to relative citation rate ( rcr ) ( i.e. , @xcite ) , nci is a relative measure as it is calculated by comparing to a mean or expected citation rate . on the other hand , this is a specific measure of citation impact because it is averaged to be a measure of impact for research group .",
    "it has long been known that citation rates are different for different disciplines .",
    "the main advantage of _ evidence _ calculations is non - trivial normalisation of citation counts between different academic disciplines . to achieve this ,",
    "the total citation count for each paper can be normalised to an average citations per paper for the year of publication and either the field or journal in which the paper was published ( the so - called `` rebasing '' of the citation count ) .",
    "the normalised value is known as the nci @xcite .",
    "only the four papers per individual which were submitted to rae 2008 were taken into account by _ evidence _ in order to calculate the average nci for research groups @xcite .",
    "the rae does not emplot a comparable normalisation process and this is a serious and acknowledged weakness of that peer evaluation exercise @xcite .",
    "thus , the nci may be considered as a _ specific _ measure of the research impact of a department in a given field and we denote it by @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding _ absolute _ measure of impact ( the total impact of the department or group ) is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the relationship between the two is @xmath12 in the following , we compare the _ specific _ indicators of quality and impact @xmath1 and @xmath3 as measures of the average strength and impact of the group or department _ per individual _ contained within it .",
    "we also compare the counterpart _ absolute _ measurements @xmath0 and @xmath2 as measures of the overall strength and total impact of the group as a whole .",
    "we use the biology research sector in the uk as a test case .",
    "we show that while the specific measures @xmath1 and @xmath3 are only weakly correlated , the absolute ones @xmath0 and @xmath2 are strongly aligned .",
    "the analysis thus suggests that citations form a poor basis for measuring institutional research quality but could form a good basis for measuring strength . since quality related funding as defined by hefce is proportional to departmental strength rather than quality",
    ", the citation - based measures may offer a reasonable and cost effective way to decide on funding while ameliorating the negative effects of goodhart s law .",
    "we have to note that although rae assessments as well as the evidence results are used for practical purposes , they are still subject to debate within the scientometric community .",
    "this is an additional reason to compare them .",
    ".the ranking of uk biology departments using the rae 2008 scores @xmath1 and the nci - based scores  @xmath3 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_coefficients ]",
    "a conclusion of the above analysis is that there is only weak correlation between the specific measure of impact @xmath3 and the rae peer - evaluated measure of quality @xmath1 , and that this is especially weak , or absent for small groups .",
    "possible reasons for this include the facts that ( i ) there are few small and medium groups ( only 5 small groups and only only 7 medium groups ) in biology and ( ii ) small groups , by definition , have relatively few members . both of these factors mean that the statistics for small ( and to a lesser extent medium ) groups are relatively poor in comparison to those for large groups .",
    "since the number of large groups is bigger and also the statistics for large groups are better , more robust results can be obtained for large groups .    moreover , in the above analysis , all research groups are treated as contributing the same weight to the analysis .",
    "e.g. , the three researchers from bath spa university contribute to the same extent as the 213.69 biologists from cambridge university ! it is therefore sensible to correct this anomaly by introducing weights . multiplying the average quality of groups by their size renders the specific measures absolute : quality becomes strength and the nci is also scaled up to the volume of the group or department .",
    "the rae , peer - reviewed measures of strength @xmath0 are compared to the absolute , citation - based measures of nci in fig .",
    "[ fig5_rae_vs_evidence_unnormalized ] .",
    "the correlation between the two measures is impressive .",
    "this is reflected in the almost perfect person correlation coefficient @xmath13 ( see table  [ tab_coefficients ] ) .",
    "moreover , restricting the analysis only to large groups also reveals an excellent correlation of @xmath14 .",
    "the correlation coefficients for medium groups alone is less good , at @xmath15 and for small groups that figure is @xmath16 .",
    "however , since small and medium research groups tend to have the same linear dependency of quality on quantity @xcite it is more sensible to combine them in the correlation analysis .",
    "indeed , the pearson correlation coefficient for small and medium groups combined is @xmath17 .",
    "thus we can say that the nci forms a good proxy for peer - review estimates of group research strength for large and small / medium research departments .",
    "[ fig5_rae_vs_evidence_unnormalized ] should be compared to fig .",
    "[ fig1_rae_vs_evidence ] .",
    "the replacement of specific measures of quality and impact by their absolute counterparts has had the effect of stretching the corresponding axes by an amount proportional to the quantity of the groups or departments . because of the clear relationship between quality and quantity identified in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a similar relationship between nci impact and quantity observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this stretching induces the improved correlations observed .",
    "a goal of scientometrics is to develop a method to provide a reliable measurement of scientific excellence using minimal efforts .",
    "however , any attempts to replace current peer - evaluation based systems have to be done carefully and robustly . quality related funding , such as that administered by hefce post rae in the uk is proportional to absolute measures of research strength since financial support for research obviously needs to be weighted according to group size .",
    "therefore , a citation based approach , at least for large groups , may be introduced as less intrusive and more cost effective alternative to national peer review .",
    "this would also have the advantage of ameliorating the distortions to the research system introduced on a national basis every five years or so through goodhart s phenomenon , although one might expect a citation - based system to introduce distortions of its own .",
    "however , we have also seen that the citation metrics used here are not well correlated with peer - review measures of group research excellence .",
    "since the latter are used to rank institutions , it is clear that citation counts are not a good basis on which to make such comparisons .",
    "thus we arrive at the almost paradoxical conclusion that the citation - based metric ( nci ) may be used as an excellent proxy for peer - reviewed measurements of institutional scientific strength but it is only a poor proxy for measures of quality .",
    "since quality related funding is strength based , this may offer a much cheaper alternative to the system currently in use in the uk and some other countries .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on biology research groups in the uk .",
    "further analyses are underway for other disciplines to determine the broader suitability of scientometric measures of specific and absolute research - group properties .",
    "the nuances connected with peculiarities of groups of different sizes should be also studied . since in the uk system ,",
    "a large group with , say 40 members , provides @xmath18 submissions , which may be sufficiently large for statistical fluctuations to be ironed out .",
    "but the rae evaluation of a small group , say with 5 staff members , is based on the statistics of only approximately @xmath19 submissions .",
    "this is far more susceptible to inaccuracies and statistical noise .",
    "so , any automated evaluation of large groups is much more robust than for small groups  even if one is only interested in measuring strength rather than quality . a possible way to balance this ,",
    "if introducing citation counts , would be to keep peer review for small and medium sized groups or to require a greater number of outputs per person for such groups to improve statistics .",
    "investigations into such schemes are underway . in any case , it is clear from the current test case that any attempt to automatically evaluate research quality should very carefully take account of group or departmental sizes @xcite .",
