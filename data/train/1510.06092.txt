    "humankind has accrued _ a priori _ knowledge since the onset of _ homo sapiens_. from ancient cave paintings to modern research papers , the species desire toward sedimentation has been displayed as a documentary .",
    "an encyclopedia , a set of documents that contains a vast collection of information from the entire field of human knowledge , has played a pivotal role in disseminating these legacies  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , a group of experts devote their expertise to these encyclopedias  @xcite . taking advantage of technological developments , media that publish encyclopedias keep abreast of the times : handwriting , letterpress printing , and optical disks .",
    "the emergence of information technology has opened a new era of publishing traditional encyclopedias on the world wide web  @xcite , which offers a variety of references and up - to - date information .",
    "although these new media can reduce the publication price , encyclopedia editing is still costly .",
    "besides the improvement of traditional encyclopedias , new media enable fresh challengers to participate in the competition .",
    "wikipedia  @xcite , a representative player among the challengers , has proposed an entirely new manner : editing by volunteers with various backgrounds in a collective fashion .",
    "this new paradigm of sharing knowledge is one of the most famous examples of `` collective intelligence . ''",
    "however , due to the nature of open - edit policy , wikipedia does not guarantee that the contents are valid  @xcite , thus it is regarded ambiguous and even inaccurate to utilize in scientific context  @xcite . despite such a long - standing bias against the credibility of wikipedia , many studies suggest that wikipedia is more reliable than our prejudice ; wikipedia itself tends to refer reliable scientific sources  @xcite .",
    "only 13% of wikipedia articles contain perceptible academic errors  @xcite and the quantity of factual errors , omissions , or ambiguous statements in scientific context of wikipedia is comparable to traditional encyclopedias  @xcite .    gradually , prejudice against the quality of wikipedia s articles has been eroded and the number of citations to wikipedia in peer - reviewed scientific articles has increased over time  @xcite .",
    "a bizarre gap between such prejudice and the actual situation appeals to the scholars , who have analyzed wikipedia s external characters and internal dynamics .",
    "for example , researchers have investigated editors of wikipedia and their editing patterns  @xcite , and the occurrence and resolving of conflicts in wikipedia  @xcite . despite the significant contributions of such endeavors , the previous studies mainly focus on the raw number of edits , and often neglect real time and the different editing patterns for articles with different sizes and ages . in this paper , we examine an exhaustive set of english wikipedia articles to understand how the article size and age displays external appearance in this open - editing encyclopedia . in particular , a simple time - rescaling method reveals articles belonging to various types , when we take account of the interrelation between observable parameters : the number of edits , the number of editors , and the article size .",
    "our analysis consists of both data analysis and modeling based on it .",
    "first , we use the entire edit history in wikipedia to inspect wikipedia s growth , mainly focusing on the number of edits , the number of editors , and the article size . in this process , we demonstrate that the consideration of real time is essential to understand the underlying dynamics behind the present wikipedia .",
    "second , to consider the formation of current wikipedia in more detail , we develop an agent - based model that imitates the interplay between an article and the editors in a society . our model shows inherent differences of articles belonging to different types of growth patterns .",
    "the results are consistent with real data , which suggests that a society s attitudes on wikipedia articles determine the growth pattern .",
    "we believe that this approach provides valuable insights for the formation of collective knowledge .",
    "we focus on the long - term formation of collective knowledge , which has significant effects on the progress of humankind over a variety of temporal scales .",
    "we hope that our work provides insights to solve some of the fundamental questions : why people collaborate , how the collective memory is formed , and how knowledge is spread and descended .",

    "for the analysis , we use the december 2014 dump of english wikipedia .",
    "this dump contains the complete copy of wikipedia articles from the very beginning up to december 8 , 2014 , including the raw text source and metadata source in the extensible markup language ( xml ) format  @xcite . in this data set , there are a total of @xmath0 articles across all categories with the full history of edits .",
    "each article documents either the wikipedia account identification ( i d ) or internet protocol ( ip ) address of the editor for each edit , the article size and timestamp for each edit , etc .",
    "a single character in english takes 1 byte , so the article size is the direct measure of article length  @xcite .",
    "there are @xmath2 editing events ( `` edits '' from now on ) for all wikipedia articles in total , where individual articles edit numbers range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "previous studies tend to sample data sets for various reasons , and thus articles with small numbers of edits are necessarily filtered out  @xcite",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ numeditspdf ] suggests a fat - tailed distribution for the number of edits , so the majority of articles are not edited as many times as the articles in the tail part of the distribution and those articles should not be neglected .",
    "therefore , we consider all entries and use the entire set for analysis",
    ". additionally , we use the i d and ip address , for logged - in editors and unlogged - in editors , respectively , to identify distinct editors . in total , @xmath5 editors have participated in the establishment of the current wikipedia . among them , 83.9% ( @xmath1 ) of editors are unlogged - in and only 16.1% ( @xmath6 ) of editors are logged - in .",
    "interestingly , the absolute share of logged - in editors is rather smaller than that of unlogged - in editors ; most of the heavy editors tend to be logged - in ( fig .",
    "[ numeditslogged ] ) .",
    "specifically , logged - in editors have modified the articles 455397682 times ( 77.5% ) in total , meanwhile unlogged - in editors have modified the articles only 132475517 times ( 22.5% ) .",
    "considering the fact that the number of unlogged - in editors exceeds that of logged - in editors , the average influence of a single unlogged - in editor is much smaller than that of logged - in editors ( on average , 69.8 times per logged - in editor and 3.9 times per unlogged - in editor ) .",
    "there are possible biases for ip addresses when an ip address is shared , e.g. , editors who use a library , public wifi , virtual private network ( vpn ) , etc . , or move the locations . in those cases , there will be under- or overestimation of the number of distinct editors .",
    "additionally , several home internet connection methods allocate ip addresses dynamically , e.g. , digital subscriber line ( dsl ) and dial - up . for those cases",
    ", there might be overestimation and misidentification of distinct editors .",
    "however , it is reported that cable and fiber to the home ( ftth ) dominate the u.s .",

    "considering both the market shares and modest impact of single unlogged - in editors on the current wikipedia , we believe that our analysis is robust .",
    "in fact , we actually check that even when we exclude unlogged - in editors , our results reported in sec .  [",
    "sec : data_analysis ] are not affected at all indeed .",
    "in addition , a small number of edits does not specify the editor , yet we use other information even for such cases based on the article size and timestamp .",
    "-th year '' corresponds to the edit event occurring between the first and the last day of the @xmath7-th year since the onset of the article .",
    "the time differences follow fat - tailed distribution , which is a sign of the burstiness , with a daily periodic pattern ( @xmath3 day = @xmath8 s).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "previous studies on the wikipedia data set did not use the information about article size changes after the edits  @xcite or real timestamps of the edits  @xcite .",
    "we combine such information together with conventional measures , such as the number of edits and the number of editors , to display the nature of wikipedia .",
    "our first analysis of time and size differences between two consecutive edits reveals regularity , regardless of an article age and size .",
    "the time between the consecutive edits follows a fat - tailed distribution with characteristic periodicity from the human circadian rhythm ( fig .",
    "[ deltatimeperage ] ) , which suggests that the editing timescale of wikipedia is intermittent or `` bursty , '' meaning that brief but intense activities are followed by much smaller activities for a long time  @xcite .",
    "these intense activities in wikipedia are reported as `` wikipedia edit war , '' which refers to significantly rapid consecutive editing by various editors with conflicting opinions  @xcite .",
    "our observation indicates that the `` edit number '' ( or the number of edits ) , which many studies use as the proxy of the real time  @xcite , is not an unbiased proxy of the time .",
    "counterposed to the assumption that english wikipedia has already become global media , we observe strong periodicity for the time between the consecutive edits in fig .",
    "[ deltatimeperage ] .",
    "the peaks are located at every @xmath8 s or a single day , which implies that native english speakers ( mostly people in the united states because of the relative population , we presume ) still dominate english wikipedia even though there is no barrier to global access .",
    "such a circadian pattern in the frequency of editing events is mainly driven by editors with specific cultural backgrounds for the data until the beginning of 2010s , as reported in ref .",
    "our observation indeed shows that the circadian rhythm also affects the interediting time in a collective fashion , and this domination still remains in the current wikipedia .    besides the time scale",
    ", we observe that an article s growth is mainly addition and subtraction with a characteristic size scale , which are rather independent of the current size ( fig .",
    "[ deltasizepersize ] ) .",
    "this observation is counterposed to the recent report that the growth of collaborated open - source software and mammalian body masses are proportional to their size  @xcite , and implies that the influence of a single edit becomes smaller as article size is increased .",
    "most previous research  @xcite does not take into account the degree of the influence for a single edit , and thus considers all of the edits as affecting the article of wikipedia equally .",
    "however , our observations propose the necessity of combining the time and size difference between the edits with the conventional measures .          in sec .",
    "[ sec : edit_scale_of_wikipedia ] , we have shown that the time between two consecutive edits is quite heterogeneous ( fig .",
    "[ deltatimeperage ] ) .",
    "this global effect of various timescales itself makes it unfair to directly compare the characteristic parameters of articles : the number of editors , edits , and the article size for different articles . to compensate for such an effect",
    ", we employ rescaled measures for article @xmath9 as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , the age of article @xmath9 , is measured as the time between the moment of onset and that of the latest edit of article @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the number of edits , the number of editors , and the article size for article @xmath9 , respectively",
    ". the rescaled measures are free from the temporal effects , making it possible to recruit myriad articles into the same ground for analysis in the sense of growth per unit time . for the number of edits , the number of editors , and the article size from the data , we hereafter use their rescaled values unless stated otherwise .",
    "a natural step forward is to search for any possible interplay between @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 in the formation of current wikipedia .",
    "one can suppose that the number of edits has varied gradually as a function of the number of editors , because both measures reflect the degree of interest in the article .",
    "unexpectedly , we discover that the articles show a peculiar bimodality in their number of editors across the entire value of the number of edits [ see fig .",
    "[ bimodality](a ) ] .",
    "the bimodality is characterized by the linear relation @xmath20 with two distinct proportionality constants , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "in other words , there are two groups of articles , determined by the proportion between the number of editors involved in the articles and the editors average activity ; one group is dominated by a relatively small number of enthusiasts who edit articles frequently , and the other is composed of a relatively large number of editors who seldom edit articles .",
    "besides the cases of edits and editors , wikipedia shows a similar division of article size for given numbers of editors [ see fig .",
    "[ bimodality](b ) ] .",
    "there are two types of articles determined by the average article size produced by an editor per unit time .",
    "this relation is also described by the linear dependency @xmath23 , where @xmath24 for the upper mode and @xmath25 for the lower mode . in other words , editors for some articles",
    "have generated about @xmath26 bytes on average , meanwhile the editors of the rest of the articles have generated only about @xmath27 bytes on average .",
    "our finding of bimodality in the two relations ( @xmath17 versus @xmath18 and @xmath18 versus @xmath28 ) triggers an interesting question : does each of the modes in one relation correspond to each mode in the other relation [ figs .",
    "[ bimodality](a ) and [ bimodality](b ) ] ?",
    "it seems natural to speculate that such modes have the counterparts in the other relation , or at least one is subordinative of the other .",
    "contrary to this speculation , our observation suggests that there is no visible relationship between the two different types of bimodality [ see figs .",
    "[ bimodality](c)[bimodality](f ) ] .",
    "the points in the figures are colored according to the modes to which the corresponding articles belong in the criteria based on @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "we simply tear off the upper and lower modes by drawing a line [ the dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ bimodality](a ) and [ bimodality](b ) ] between the two modes and assign purple and blue colors for the points in the upper and the lower modes , respectively .",
    "those purple and blue points are totally mixed when the criterion is based on the other parameter relation .",
    "taken together , we conclude that there are at least four different groups of articles , which can be categorized by its growth per unit time .",
    "the possible mechanism behind the division is suggested based on our modeling study in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "to understand the underlying dynamics of the observed patterns , we develop a mechanistic model of editing dynamics by identifying two key factors that drive the evolution of wikipedia articles .",
    "we assume that there are two fundamental and inherent properties of an article reflecting the society s viewpoint on the article s topic : the preferences for referring wikipedia and the desires to edit ( namely , editability ) . in this section",
    ", we show that two such key drivers have elicited the wikipedia into its current state as shown in fig .",
    "[ bimodality ] .",
    "interestingly , each of those has a decisive effect on the distinct modality structure of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , and they have almost no impact on each other s modality .",
    "the preferences for referring wikipedia stems from its relative credibility compared to other conventional media . in other words , people tend to refer wikipedia more than other conventional media or opinion from others for certain topics .",
    "because of the nature of open - edit policy , there are long - lasting arguments of credibility , especially for the scientific contexts  @xcite . as a result",
    ", people avoid referring wikipedia to reinforce their contention for scientific topics when they debate .",
    "nevertheless , several topics are almost free from the trust issue and wikipedia can be considered as a trustworthy source of knowledge .",
    "the subcultures such as animations , movies , and computer games are good examples , because the editors are not only a fan of the topic but also the creators of such cultures  @xcite . in those cases , therefore , members of a society do not hesitate to utilize wikipedia as their grounds for the arguments .",
    "in addition , there are different levels of psychological barriers and desires in editing , depending on the topic . people tend to edit the article about which they have enough knowledge  @xcite .",
    "thus , the average `` editability '' of articles , for members of a society , is diverse by its nature from the casual ones which are easily editable to the formal ones .",
    "this editability also depends on collective motives , which describe the significance of the topic as the common goal of social movements  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic rate of edit should be taken into account .",
    "besides these two key factors , editors are also engaged in articles when they have already given more effort to the articles by editing them  @xcite , representing the feeling of attachment . additionally , it is hard to edit an article that already has a massive amount of information  @xcite , so the motivation to edit will be reduced as the article size is increased .",
    "we describe how we implement the sociopsychological effects into our mathematical model in detail .      by incorporating the aforementioned factors ,",
    "we create a mechanistic model of the article growth .",
    "the model comprises @xmath31 agents where the individual agents represent members of a society and all of the agents are connected to a single wikipedia article .",

    "a pair of agents @xmath9 and @xmath45 , which are neighbors in a preassigned network , is chosen and they try to convince each other for the topic of the wikipedia article .",

    "analogous to our presumption , this ratio is a decreasing function of @xmath86 ( see fig .",
    "[ modelverify ] ) .    to treat the other parameter @xmath46",
    ", we should employ the proxy that can reflect the general interest of the entire society in the topic .",
    "we suggest that the google books @xmath7-gram , a vast digitized collection of documents produced in the world is a suitable choice  @xcite .",
    "google books @xmath7-gram is a database containing about 6% of english books ever published .",
    "this data set offers a yearly number of occurrences for any phrase less than six words from 1800 to 2008 , and this number of occurrences can be considered as the proxy of interests in society for a certain phrase . in our model",
    ", @xmath46 is the proportion of degree of interest in wikipedia versus that of the entire society . in other words ,",
    "wikipedia page view on a certain topic versus its @xmath7-gram frequency can be the estimator of @xmath46 . for fair comparison",
    ", we also only take the wikipedia articles that satisfy the following conditions .",
    "first , the title of article should exist in google 1-gram data set in 2008 , the latest year of the data set .",
    "second , the article should be visited at least once in 2014 . to avoid the effect of inflectional variation of words",
    ", we use the stem of wikipedia articles title and google 1-gram data set  @xcite , instead of using the word directly . after this filtering process",
    ", @xmath76 articles are left among the total set of @xmath0 articles .",
    "this estimator of @xmath46 also decays , as @xmath87 is increased as we expected .    both figs .",
    "[ modelverify](a ) and [ modelverify](b ) indeed show the behaviors expected from their estimators ( @xmath57 and @xmath46 , respectively ) , which indicates that our model is suitable to describe the real wikipedia .",
    "note that the estimators of @xmath57 and @xmath46 should not be taken as the exact face values of model parameter values for a real article in wikipedia , and the results should be understood as a proxy of statistical properties of articles .",
    "first , page view statistics might be affected by the number of hyperlinks pointed to the article .",
    "such relative importance within the network topology may increase the page view by random visits , yet there is a positive feedback between the page view and the number of hyperlinks .",
    "an article also tends to have connections to popular articles  @xcite , which eventually yields disproportionally many hyperlinks for popular items ; thus there could be overestimation of page views for the popular articles .",
    "moreover , there is a recent report that warns of the possible bias of google @xmath7-gram as the proxy of real popularity in our society  @xcite .",
    "this year - by - year level fluctuation may give unfairness to compare the frequencies many years apart .",
    "to avoid such fluctuation , we restrict our results for the year 2008 . additionally , word - by - word fluctuation should be canceled during the averaging process , because each data point corresponds to a massive number of articles . as a result",
    ", we believe that our observation is still valid , in spite of such fluctuations that might cause some degree of bias .",
    "the heterogeneity for the ratio of the number of editors to that of edits , @xmath86 , leads us to the eventual question : is this heterogeneity from structural inequality ?",
    "in other words , does the existence of dictatorship or monopoly of small group editors , or super editors  @xcite , make it difficult for others to participate in editing processes ? to find the answer , we use the gini coefficient , which is a common measure for inequality in economics  @xcite ranging from @xmath40 for the minimal inequality ( or the maximal equality ) to @xmath3 as the maximal inequality .",
    "we consider the number of edits for individual editors as the wealth variable in the gini coefficient .",
    "the trend of the gini coefficient as a decreasing function of @xmath86 shown in fig .",
    "[ gini](a ) suggests the modes with slope @xmath88 and @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ bimodality](a ) are in equilibrium and non - equilibrium states , respectively .",
    "additional analysis of the gini coefficient in terms of the @xmath57 estimator ( the ratio of the number of edits in 2014 to the page view statistics in 2014 ) also indicates that the larger @xmath57 induces more severe inequality for editing [ see fig .",
    "[ gini](b ) ] .",
    "this is counterintuitive because it actually means that articles inducing larger motivation to edit eventually set a larger barrier to participate in editing .",
    "it is doubtful that the phenomenon is caused by the amount of information  @xcite , since the gini coefficient does not vary much according to its amount of information [ see fig .",
    "[ gini](c ) ] .",
    "similar to the real wikipedia , our model also supports the observed inequality .",
    "although we use a simplified estimator of @xmath57 in our real data , the ratio of the number of edits in 2014 to the page view statistics , the gini coefficient is an increasing function of @xmath57 in the model as in the real data [ see fig .  [ gini](d ) ] . additionally , since @xmath57 has a limited effect on the article size ( see fig .  [ bimodality ] ) , the model observation of the gini coefficient is compatible to our observation that article size does not have a large effect on the gini coefficients .",
    "such logical elimination suggests that a few engaged and dominating editors make it indeed hard for laypeople to participate in editing processes .",
    "there are `` democratic '' articles ( with slope of @xmath88 in fig .  [ bimodality ] ) and `` dictatorial '' articles ( with slope of @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ bimodality ] ) . in short",
    ", inequality exists indeed .",
    "traditionally , collaboration used to be mainly regional and face - to - face interactions were demanded , which had prevented the world - wide formation of collective intelligence .",
    "nowadays , improvements of modern information technology bring us a whole new stage of online collaboration . in this study",
    ", we have examined such a new passion of collective intelligence through long - term data from wikipedia  @xcite .",
    "people believe that such a new paradigm will eventually yield democratization of knowledge  @xcite . as a representative medium , wikipedia",
    "is also considered as a spearhead of such pro - democracy movements  @xcite .",
    "however , our observation suggests that the current status of wikipedia is still apart from the perfect world - wide democracy .",
    "the observed periodicity for the time between edits alludes that the english wikipedia is still regional for english natives ( see fig .",
    "[ deltatimeperage ] ) .",
    "bimodality and its inequality index suggest that there are articles dominated by a small number of super editors ( figs .",
    "[ bimodality][gini ] ) .",
    "notwithstanding the fact that there is no explicit ownership for wikipedia articles , some kind of privatization by dedicated editors for given topics is happening in reality .",
    "the value of such dedicated editors should not be depreciated , of course .",
    "their dedication has indeed played the main role in keeping the current state - of - the - art accuracy in the current wikipedia  @xcite . however ,",
    "in the long run , knowledge can not survive without collaboration between experts and society  @xcite . although most advanced knowledge is invented by experts ,",
    "such experts occupy a rather small proportion in a society ; thus , knowledge without support from other members of the society will lose its dynamic force to sustain . additionally , despite our findings that the amount of contents created by an editor ( @xmath87 ) mainly depends on the degree of referring wikipedia ( namely @xmath46 ) , an equitable opportunity for participation also increases such individual productivity ( see fig .",
    "[ modelresults ] ) .",
    "our study not only gives significant insight into the formation and current state of wikipedia , but also offers the future direction of wikipedia .",
    "our simulation results suggest that such inequality is increased with time , which may result in less productivity and less accuracy as by - product in the future than now [ see figs .  [",
    "modelresults](a ) and [ gini](e ) ] .",
    "it is indeed already reported that the growth of wikipedia is slowing down  @xcite and our observation suggests that it will become even slower if we do not take any active action . to sustain collaborating environments ,",
    "it is worth giving more motivation and incentives to the newbies to reduce the monopolized structure in wikipedia .",
    "we hope that extending our approach to various collaboration environments such as open - source movement  @xcite might give us the insight for the future investment that brings us a new level of collaborating environments .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the results and implications of our study are not restricted to the wikipedia or online collaboration systems , but have much wider applications in human or nonhuman interactions in the world .",
