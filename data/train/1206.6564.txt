    "despite more than forty years of direct spacecraft measurements of turbulence in the near - earth solar wind @xcite , our understanding of turbulence in a magnetized plasma remains incomplete .",
    "one of the primary goals is to understand the role of the turbulence in mediating the transfer of energy from large to small scales . within the turbulent inertial range of scales ,",
    "corresponding to spacecraft - frame frequencies of @xmath0 hz @xmath1 hz or length scales @xmath2  km @xmath3  km , the fluctuations involved in this energy transfer are a mixture of compressible and incompressible fluctuations , with around 90% of the energy in the incompressible component @xcite .",
    "these incompressible fluctuations have been identifed as alfvn waves @xcite , but the nature of the compressible component remains uncertain .",
    "the compressible turbulent fluctuations have often been interpreted as a combination of magnetoacoustic ( fast mhd ) waves and pressure - balanced structures @xcite .",

    "further studies found evidence of pbss out to 24  au @xcite .",
    "related investigations discovered a similar anti - correlation between the density @xmath4 and magnetic field magnitude @xmath5 from 0.3  au to 18  au on timescales ranging from several hours to 1.8 minutes @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of compressive mhd fluctuations in the low - mach number , high-@xmath6 limit interpreted these anti - correlated density - magnetic field strength observations as nonpropagating `` pseudosound '' density fluctuations @xcite . later , a more comprehensive observational investigation confirmed the general density - magnetic field magnitude anti - correlation , but also identified a few positively correlated intervals consistent with the magnetosonic ( fast mhd ) wave @xcite .",
    "analysis of _ ulysses _ observations found evidence for pbss at inertial range scales in the high latitude solar wind @xcite .",
    "studies of the electron density up to @xmath7  hz also found pressure balanced structures but interpreted these as ion acoustic ( slow mhd ) waves and recognized that pbss are simply the ion acoustic ( slow mhd ) wave in the perpendicular wavevector limit @xcite , a fact previously noted by @xcite .",
    "recently , measurements of the anti - correlation between electron density and magnetic field strength indicated the existence of pbss over timescales ranging from 1000  s down to 10  s @xcite .",
    "an important consideration in the study of the compressible fluctuations of solar wind turbulence is the fact that the mean free path in the solar wind plasma is about 1  au , so the dynamics over the entire inertial range is weakly collisional .",
    "the implications of this fact have not been seriously addressed in any of the aforementioned studies of compressible fluctuations in solar wind turbulence .",
    "the mhd description is rigorously valid only in the limit of strong collisionality , so a kinetic description is formally required to describe the inertial range turbulence . in the limit @xmath8 predicted by anisotropic mhd turbulence theories @xcite",

    "the compressible fast and slow wave modes , on the other hand , require a kinetic description to resolve both the wave dynamics and the collisionless kinetic damping mechanisms .",
    "the study presented here is the first to examine the properties of the compressible fluctuations in the turbulent solar wind using vlasov - maxwell kinetic theory . specifically , we use the predicted correlation between the density fluctuations and parallel magnetic field fluctuations to determine the nature of the compressible fluctuations in the solar wind .    in  [ sec :",

    "if these fluctuations are interpreted as some mixture of the three mhd linear wave modes , then alfvn waves are responsible for the incompressible component , while slow and fast mhd waves make up the compressible component . in the limit of large scales",
    "compared to the thermal ion larmor radius , @xmath9 , these modes may be distinguished by the correlation between the density and parallel magnetic field fluctuations : fast waves are positively correlated , slow waves are negatively correlated , and the density and parallel magnetic field fluctuations are both zero for alfvn waves . as the wave amplitude is increased to nonlinear levels , even in the limit that they form discontinuities or shocks , these qualitative properties persist , corresponding to tangential and rotational discontinuities or fast and slow shocks @xcite . in this section , we will explore the properties of the kinetic counterparts to the fast and slow mhd wave modes in the inertial range using vlasov - maxwell kinetic theory .",

    "we restrict ourselves to establishing the connection between mhd wave modes and vlasov - maxwell wave modes in the inertial range limit , @xmath9 . due to the reduced parameter space of the vlasov - maxwell system in the inertial range limit",

    "as discussed by @xcite , the identification of corresponding wave modes is complicated by the existence of a branch cut in the complex solution space of the vlasov - maxwell dispersion relation . at inertial range scales",
    "@xmath23 , this branch cut exists only at small angles @xmath14 ; for wavevectors in the perpendicular limit , the kinetic fast , alfvn , and slow modes are always easily distinguished .",

    "@xmath14 presented in the leftmost two columns of figure  [ fig : polar ] , the correspondence between the mhd and kinetic wave modes is clear .",
    "it is worth noting , however , several distinctions between the fluid and kinetic behavior .",
    "first , the kinetic slow wave has a greater phase speed than the alfvn wave for @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently parallel wavevectors and @xmath44 , the kinetic slow mode also has a greater phase velocity than the fast mode .",
    "second , the typical magnetic - to - acoustic mode conversion that occurs for the mhd fast and slow modes at @xmath45 is replaced by a conversion between the compressible kinetic roots at @xmath46 . this conversion leads to damping of the fast waves at small angles @xmath14 in the large @xmath31 limit .",

    "this will enable us to verify whether the general qualitative properties of this correlation  that fast waves are positively correlated , and slow waves negatively correlated ",
    "remain unchanged for collisionless conditions .",
    "the density fluctuation @xmath47 and parallel magnetic field fluctuation @xmath48 may be calculated from the complex solution of the linear vlasov - maxwell dispersion relation .",

    "the kinetic slow mode ( right ) has a negative correlation with @xmath60 over most of the @xmath56 plane ; the correlation becomes slightly positive for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the alfvn mode ( center ) , presented for completeness , has a more complicated behavior , but it is worthwhile noting that the amplitudes of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are both very small ( compared to the characteristic amplitudes for either of the compressible waves ) at inertial range scales , so this correlation for alfvn waves is likely to be unmeasurable in the solar wind . in general , these results confirm that the general qualitative properties of the density - parallel magnetic field correlation remain unchanged for the kinetic fast , alfvn , and slow modes in a weakly collisional plasma .    , for the kinetic fast ( left ) , alfvn ( center ) , and slow ( right ) modes over the plane @xmath56 .",
    "a positive correlation is found for the kinetic fast modes , and a generally negative correlation for the slow modes . ]",
    "the primary methodology employed in this study of the compressible fluctuations in the solar wind inertial range is the construction of synthetic spacecraft data for direct comparison to actual single - point spacecraft measurements . for the present study of the correlation between the density and parallel magnetic field fluctuations , this technique enables us to determine the characteristics of the correlation in the presence of a turbulent spectrum of wave modes .",
    "this method of analysis is based on the _ quasi - linear premise _ that some characteristics of magnetized plasma turbulence can be usefully modeled as a collection of randomly phased , linear wave modes ; the justification for this premise is discussed in  [ sec : premise ] .",
    "the result from  [ sec : model]that , in the inertial range , the dynamics of both mhd and vlasov - maxwell plasmas depend only on two parameters , the ion plasma beta @xmath31 and the wavevector angle @xmath14significantly simplifies the construction of synthetic plasma data . upon adoption of the quasi - linear premise and specification of the plasma @xmath31 , one need only choose the partitioning of power among the contributing linear wave modes ( fast , alfvn , or slow ) and the wavevector distribution of power ( isotropic or critically balanced ) for each of those modes , as described in  [ sec : procedure ] .",
    "the theoretical investigation of turbulence using synthetic data is based on a concept that we denote the _ quasi - linear premise_. the quasi - linear premise states that some properties of magnetized plasma turbulence can be understood by modeling the turbulence as a collection of randomly phased , linear waves . in this picture , the nonlinear turbulent interactions serve to transfer energy from one linear wave mode to another  thus , the picture is quasi - linear .",
    "the mathematical properties of the equations that describe turbulence in a magnetized plasma , in conjunction with a phenomonological understanding of the properties of the turbulence , provide the motivation for this quasi - linear approach .",
    "this concept can be most easily explained using the following example of turbulence in an incompressible mhd plasma .",
    "the elsasser form of the ideal incompressible mhd equations @xcite is given by @xmath63 where the magnetic field has been decomposed into its equilibrium and fluctuating parts @xmath64 , the alfvn velocity due to the equilibrium magnetic field @xmath15 is given by @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the elsasser fields describing the velocity and magnetic field behavior of waves traveling down ( up ) the mean magnetic field .",
    "the second term on the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : elsasser ] ) represents the linear propagation of the elsasser fields along the mean magnetic field at the alfvn speed , while the terms on the right - hand side represent the nonlinear interactions between upward and downward propagating waves , where the pressure gradient term ensures incompressibility of the fluctuations .",
    "the theory of strong incompressible mhd turbulence @xcite suggests that the turbulent fluctuations at small scales become anisotropic , where the nonlinear cascade of energy generates turbulent fluctuations with smaller scales in the perpendicular direction than in the parallel direction , @xmath67 .",
    "this inherent anisotropy of magnetized plasma turbulence has long been recognized from early studies in laboratory plasmas @xcite and in early numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that strong turbulence in incompressible mhd plasmas maintains a state of _ critical balance _ between the linear timescale for alfvn waves and the nonlinear timescale of turbulent energy transfer @xcite .",
    "there exists significant evidence consistent with the predictions of critical balance from analysis of numerical simulations @xcite and solar wind observations @xcite . in a state of strong turbulence",
    ", critical balance implies that the linear term @xmath68 and nonlinear term @xmath69 in equation  ( [ eq : elsasser ] ) are of the same order .",
    "it is this property that motivates the adoption of the quasi - linear premise , as discussed below .    in the absence of the nonlinear terms ( setting the first term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : elsasser ] ) to zero ) , the behavior of the plasma is entirely determined by the linear term .",
    "if the right - hand side of the equation is considered to be an arbitrary perturbing source term , the linear term determines the instantaneous response of the plasma to the imposed perturbation . in the case of weak turbulence @xcite , the nonlinear terms on the right - hand of equation  ( [ eq : elsasser ] )",
    "are indeed a small perturbation to the linear system , representing the nonlinear transfer of energy between the linear wave modes .",
    "perturbation theory may be applied to the study of the turbulent dynamics in this limit , so the quasi - linear premise is clearly valid for the case of weak turbulence .    for strong turbulence , the condition of critical balance implies that the energy in a particular linear wave mode may be transferred nonlinearly to other modes on the timescale of its linear wave period .",
    "but since the linear and nonlinear terms are of the same order in critical balance , the linear term still contributes significantly to the instantaneous response of the plasma , even in the presence of strong nonlinearity .",
    "therefore , the fluctuations in a strongly turbulent magnetized plasma are expected to retain at least some of the properties of the linear wave modes . in particular , for a turbulent fluctuation with a given wavevector , the amplitude and phase relationships between different components of that fluctuation are likely to be related to linear eigenfunctions of the characteristic plasma wave modes . in the construction of synthetic plasma turbulence data , a spectrum of randomly phased linear wave modes can be specified , with the amplitude of each of the linear modes adjusted to satisfy a chosen observational constraint , such as the turbulent magnetic energy spectrum ( the second - order moment ) . by adopting the quasi - linear premise , the properties of the synthetic turbulence data may then be compared directly to spacecraft measurements to explore the nature of turbulent fluctuations .",
    "the third- and higher - order moments of the turbulence , on the other hand , are clearly _ not _ described by this simplified quasi - linear approach .",
    "such higher order statistics depend critically on the phase relationships between different linear wave modes , and these phase relationships are determined by the nonlinear interactions responsible for the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales . for a collection of randomly phased linear waves , such higher order statistics of synthetic data constructed using the quasi - linear premise will average to zero , yielding no useful information .",
    "although our illustration of the application of the quasi - linear premise above specifies the case of turbulence in an incompressible mhd plasma , the necessary general properties of the linear and nonlinear terms , as well as the inherent anisotropy of magnetized plasma turbulence , continue to hold for less restricted plasma conditions , including kinetic plasmas @xcite .",
    "in particular , the arguments for the importance of the linear physics even in a strongly turbulent plasma also hold for the linear collisionless damping rates , providing the foundation for simple models of the turbulent energy cascade , encompassing both the inertial and dissipation ranges @xcite .    besides the feasibility arguments for the validity of the quasi - linear premise outlined above",
    ", we give here no _ a priori _ proof for its validity in strongly nonlinear plasma turbulence .",
    "nonlinear simulations of plasma turbulence and observational studies of solar wind turbulence provide two avenues for testing the validity of the premise  at present , there exist arguments in the literature both for and against its validity .",
    "analysis of nonlinear numerical simulations of plasma turbulence using gyrokinetics @xcite and both hall mhd and landau fluid theory @xcite , as well as observational analysis of multi - spacecraft data in the solar wind @xcite , support the validity of the quasi - linear premise .",
    "in addition , given that the idea of critical balance in strong mhd turbulence @xcite is essentially a quasi - linear concept  that the timescale of the nonlinear energy transfer remains of order the _ linear _ wave frequency  evidence in support of critical balance @xcite also indirectly supports the quasi - linear premise .",
    "in contrast , studies of 3d incompressible mhd simulations @xcite and 2d hybrid simulations @xcite of plasma turbulence , as well as an observational analysis of multi - spacecraft data in the solar wind @xcite , have called into question the validity of the quasi - linear premise . a review of this supporting and conflicting evidence for the quasi - linear premise is presented in @xcite , focusing in particular on questionable aspects of the conflicting studies that cast doubt on the validity of their conclusion that the quasi - linear premise is inapplicable to the case of strong plasma turbulence .",
    "it is also important to note that the utility of the quasi - linear premise for the study of plasma turbulence , however , may also be judged _ a posteriori _ by the insights gained from such an approach .      upon adopting the quasi - linear premise ,",
    "the construction and analysis of synthetic spacecraft data requires three steps :    1 .",
    "populate a synthetic plasma volume with a spectrum of linear wave modes with a chosen distribution of power in wavevector space .",
    "2 .   sample the synthetic plasma volume at the position of a probe moving with respect to the plasma to generate reduced time series comparable to single - point spacecraft measurements .",
    "perform the requisite analysis on the synthetic time series to compare to spacecraft data analysis , for example , the zero - lag cross - correlation of the density and parallel magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "for the study of the density and parallel magnetic field correlation of the solar wind compressible turbulent fluctuations , each of these steps is detailed below .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , for the inertial range of solar wind turbulence , the appropriately normalized linear physics of both the mhd ( collisional fluid ) and vlasov - maxwell ( collisionless kinetic ) systems depends on a reduced set of two parameters : the ion plasma beta @xmath31 and the wavevector angle @xmath14 . therefore , a completely general synthetic turbulent plasma requires the specification of just three properties : ( 1 ) the plasma beta , ( 2 ) the fraction of power in each of the possible linear wave modes , and ( 3 ) the distribution of power in wavevector space for each of these wave modes . both observational constraints and phenomenological models of plasma turbulence guide our choices for these properties .",

    "this result has important consequences for the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales : since only the fast wave turbulent cascade is expected to nonlinearly transfer energy to whistler waves at @xmath185 , and the frequency mismatch between the fast and either the alfvn or slow waves should prevent non - linear coupling , our analysis suggests that there is little or no transfer of large scale turbulent energy through the inertial range down to whistler waves at small scales .",
    "comparison of the observationally measured @xmath186 in figure  [ fig : money ] with both the mhd and kinetic results leads to another important conclusion of this study : the nature of the compressible fluctuations in the solar wind inertial range is not well modeled by mhd theory .",
    "this result is not surprising given that the solar wind is weakly collisional at inertial range scales , so a kinetic description is necessary to model accurately the compressible fluctuations .",
    "our study also enables us to constrain the wavevector distribution of slow wave energy by comparing the observational results with the three plots in the bottom row of figure  [ fig : ssd_nbpar ] .",
    "the leftmost plot has an isotropic distribution of slow wave power and shows two features in the @xmath141 curve not seen in the observed data : ( 1 ) a bump at @xmath44 and ( 2 ) a slight increase in the correlation value at @xmath187 .",
    "these quantitative changes in the @xmath141 curve appear the same with or without the alfvn waves at @xmath188 ( compare the left plots in the third and fourth row of figure  [ fig : ssd_nbpar ] ) , so this effect is not due to the isotropic distribution of alfvn waves . therefore , the slow waves appear to be anisotropically distributed , and may be well described by critical balance as suggested by theories of slow wave passive advection @xcite .",
    "however , the uncertainty of the wind measurements can not definitively rule out the possibility of an isotropic distribution for the slow mode .",
    "one of the key points of our companion work @xcite is the interpretation that the compressible fluctuations in the solar wind consist of a critically balanced distribution of kinetic slow wave fluctuations .",
    "previous analyses have generally dismissed the possibility of kinetic slow waves because , in an isotropic maxwellian plasma with warm ions , the collisionless damping via free - streaming along the magnetic field is strong @xcite . however , the damping rate of the slow waves for the nearly perpendicular wavevectors of a critically balanced distribution is proportional to the parallel component of the wavevector , @xmath189 .",
    "this feature can be seen in the right column of figure  [ fig : polar ] , where the slow wave damping rate ( blue ) is zero at perpendicular wavevectors @xmath36 ( open circles ) and increases as the wavevector angle decreases . for exactly perpendicular wavevectors , the damping rate drops to zero  this perpendicular limit of the slow wave corresponds to an undamped , non - propagating pressure - balanced structure ( pbs ) .",
    "it has been derived theoretically by @xcite and demonstrated numerically by @xcite that the alfvn wave dynamics advects and cascades the slow waves , so the energy cascade rate of the slow waves is related not to the slow wave frequency , but to the alfvn wave frequency .",
    "therefore , although the slow wave fluctuations at the high @xmath190 boundary of critical balanced distribution ( along @xmath191 ) may suffer strong collisionless damping , the more nearly perpendicular slow waves may be cascaded to smaller scales on the timescale of the alfvnic turbulence , while the collisionless damping of these modes remains weak .",
    "this could lead to a slow wave energy distribution that is _ more _ anisotropic than critical balance , possibly with @xmath192 .    using synthetic spacecraft data",
    ", we can test whether this picture of a distribution of slow wave power that is more anisotropic than critical balance is consistent with the observational findings in figure  [ fig : money ] . to do this",

    "demonstrate that the @xmath141 curve does not change significantly for a more anisotropic slow wave distribution .",
    "therefore , the picture of the solar wind compressible fluctuations comprised of slow wave fluctuations that are more anisotropically distributed than critical balance is consistent with the observational data .",
    "one of the limitations of this investigation is that the vlasov - maxwell eigenfunctions are computed assuming isotropic maxellian equilibrium distributions .",
    "plasma measurements in the solar wind frequently find anisotropic temperature distributions and non - maxwellian tails at high energy @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is possible that mirror modes may contribute to the measured anti - correlation between the density and parallel magnetic field , although an analysis of 10 years of _ wind _ data show that only a small fraction of the solar wind measurements occupy the region of parameter space near the mirror instability threshold @xcite .",
    "how the density - parallel magnetic field correlation is altered by these conditions is an important issue to be addressed in future work .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the first application of kinetic plasma theory to analyze and interpret the compressible fluctuations in the inertial range of solar wind turbulence .",
    "this novel approach is motivated by the fact that the dynamics in the solar wind plasma is weakly collisional , a limit in which mhd theory , used in all previous related investigations , is formally invalid .",
    "investigation of the compressible fast and slow wave modes requires a kinetic description to resolve both the wave dynamics and the collisionless kinetic damping mechanisms .",
    "we identify quantitatively the linear kinetic wave modes of vlasov - maxwell theory that correspond to the linear mhd fast and slow wave modes , and verify that the general qualitative properties of the density - parallel magnetic field correlation @xmath126that fast waves are positively correlated , and slow waves are negatively correlated  remain unchanged for the weakly collisional conditions of the solar wind plasma .",
    "we then describe the procedure used to generate synthetic spacecraft data used to interpret actual single - point spacecraft measurements of turbulence in the solar wind .",

    "2 .   strong _ a posteriori _ evidence for the validity of the quasi - linear premise is provided by the striking agreement between the observationally determined @xmath132 over a very large statistical sample and the predicted @xmath132 based on synthetic spacecraft data .",

    "our analysis using kinetic theory to interpret the compressible fluctuations motivates the following physical model of the turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind inertial range . in this model ,",
    "the solar wind inertial range consists of a mixture of turbulent fluctuations , with 90% of the energy due to incompressible alfvnic fluctuations and the remaining 10% of the energy due to compressible slow wave fluctuations .",

    "the linear alfvn wave solutions have frequency @xmath213 and eigenfunctions specified in terms of @xmath214 given by @xmath215 @xmath216    the linear slow and fast wave solutions have frequency @xmath217 where the plus sign corresponds to the fast wave , and the minus sign to the slow wave . the eigenfunctions , specified in terms of @xmath218 ,",
    "are given by @xmath219 @xmath220 @xmath221 @xmath222",
    "@xmath223    since the synthetic data sets are created by specifying a spectrum of fluctuations over some range of angles , the statistical correlations of the fluctuations depend on only three factors : ( a ) angular power distribution , ( b ) wave mode fraction , and ( c ) plasma @xmath6 .",
    "the kinetic fast and slow modes are both part of the double - valued magnetosonic solution @xcite and are separated by a branch cut from @xmath224 to @xmath225 at @xmath226 .",
    "this branch cut is similar to the magnetic and acoustic transition for the mhd fast and slow modes at @xmath227 for near parallel wavevectors .",
    "the kinetic fast and slow modes behave in an analogous fashion : the near parallel kinetic fast mode has the same phase velocity as the alfvn mode for @xmath228 ; and the near parallel kinetic slow mode matches the alfvn mode for @xmath229 ( see the center column of figure  [ fig : polar ] ) . in this work ,",
    "we label wave modes using a scheme that identifies the modes at @xmath230 , where there is no ambiguity in identification , and then follows the linear dispersion relation as @xmath14 is decreased to zero .    the compressible inertial range linear wave modes with near parallel wavevectors can be characterized as being either magnetic or acoustic .",
    "the magnetic modes have phase velocities similar to the alfvn wave , while the acoustic modes are more heavily damped than either the alfvn or the magnetic modes . from this point of view",
    ", the fast mode is the magnetic mode and the slow mode is the acoustic mode for @xmath228 , while the converse is true for @xmath231 . interestingly , for @xmath232 , the magnetic ( fast ) mode has @xmath233 and the acoustic ( slow ) mode has @xmath234 ; but , for @xmath235 , both modes have @xmath236 ( see figure  [ fig : proxy ] ) .",
    "it is this transition that is responsible for some of the qualitative features in the lower two rows of figure  [ fig : ssd_nbpar ] . in particular , the abrupt jump on the @xmath143 curve ( black ) at @xmath46 in the left and right columns ( where fast waves are isotropically distributed and so include this region of wavevector space ) and in the @xmath141 curve ( orange ) at @xmath46 in the left column ( where the slow waves are isotropically distributed ) are due to this transition .",
    "this identification of modes has important physical ramifications , especially at scales near the transition to the dissipation range .",
    "as length scales decrease towards the ion inertial length , it is the magnetic mode , and not strictly the kinetic fast mode , that transitions to the parallel whistler wave .",
    "however , the results presented in this paper suggest a lack of parallel slow wave energy as well as statistically negligible fast wave energy in the solar wind inertial range , so the difficulties of mode identification in this region of parameter space may not be problematic for studies of solar wind turbulence ."
