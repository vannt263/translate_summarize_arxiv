    "random 3-sat is a classic problem in combinatorics , at the heart of computational complexity studies and a favorite testing ground for both exactly analyzable and heuristic solution methods which are then applied to a wide variety of problems in machine learning and artificial intelligence .",
    "it consists of a ensemble of randomly generated logical expressions , each depending on @xmath0 boolean variables @xmath1 , and constructed by taking the and of @xmath2 clauses .",
    "each clause @xmath3 consists of the or of 3 `` literals '' @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath4 is taken to be either @xmath1 or @xmath5 at random with equal probability , and the three values of the index @xmath6 in each clause are distinct .",
    "conversely , the neighborhood of a variable @xmath1 is @xmath7 , the set of all clauses in which @xmath1 or @xmath5 appear . for each such random formula",
    ", one asks whether there is some set of @xmath1 values for which the formula evaluates to be true .",
    "the ratio @xmath8 controls the difficulty of this decision problem , and predicts the answer with high accuracy , at least as both @xmath0 and @xmath2 tend to infinity , with their ratio held constant . at small @xmath9 , solutions are easily found , while for sufficiently large @xmath9 there are almost certainly no satisfying configurations of the @xmath10 , and compact proofs of this fact can be constructed . between these limits lies a complex , spin - glass - like phase transition , at which the cost of analyzing the problem with either exact or heuristic methods explodes .",
    "a recent series of papers drawing upon the statistical mechanics of disordered materials has not only clarified the nature of this transition , but also lead to a thousand - fold increase in the size of the concrete problems that can be solved  @xcite this paper provides a derivation of the new methods using nothing more complex than probabilities , suggests some generalizations , and reports numerical experiments that disentangle the contributions of the several component heuristics employed . for two related discussions ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "an iterative `` belief propagation ''  @xcite ( bp ) algorithm for k - sat can be derived to evaluate the probability , or `` belief , '' that a variable will take the value true in variable configurations that satisfy the formula considered . to calculate this ,",
    "we first define a message ( `` transport '' ) sent from a variable to a clause :    * @xmath11 is _ the probability that variable @xmath1 satisfies clause @xmath3 _    in the other direction , we define a message ( `` influence '' ) sent from a clause to a variable :    * @xmath12 is _ the probability that clause @xmath3 is satisfied by another variable than @xmath1 _    in 3-sat , where clause @xmath3 depends on variables @xmath1 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , bp gives the following iterative update equation for its influence .",
    "@xmath15    the bp update equations for the transport @xmath11 involve the products of influences acting on a variable from the clauses which surround @xmath1 , forming its `` cavity , '' @xmath7 , sorted by which literal ( @xmath1 or @xmath5 ) appears in the clause : @xmath16 the update equations are then @xmath17 the superscripts @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote iteration .",
    "the probabilistic interpretation is the following : suppose we have @xmath20 for all clauses",
    "@xmath21 connected to variable @xmath6 .",
    "each of these clauses can either be satisfied by another variable ( with probability @xmath20 ) , or not be satisfied by another variable ( with probability @xmath22 ) , and also be satisfied by variable @xmath6 itself .",
    "if we set variable @xmath1 to 0 , then some clauses are satisfied by @xmath1 , and some have to be satisfied by other variables .",
    "the probability that they are all _ satisfied _ is @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath1 is set to 1 then all these clauses @xmath21 are satisfied with probability @xmath24 . the products in ( [ eq : scott - scaled - t - iterations ] )",
    "can therefore be interpreted as joint probabilities of independent events .",
    "variable @xmath1 can be @xmath25 or @xmath26 in a solution if the clauses in which @xmath1 appears are either satisfied directly by @xmath1 itself , or by other variables .",
    "hence @xmath27 a bp - based decimation scheme results from fixing the variables with largest probability to be either true or false .",
    "we then recalculate the beliefs for the reduced formula , and repeat .",
    "to arrive at sp we introduce a modified system of beliefs : every variable falls into one of three classes : true in all solutions ( 1 ) ; false in all solutions(0 ) ; and true in some and false in other solutions ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the message from a clause to a variable ( an influence ) is then the same as in bp above . although we will again only need to keep track of one message from a variable to a clause ( a transport ) , it is convenient to first introduce three ancillary messages :    * @xmath29 is _ the probability that variable @xmath1 is true in clause @xmath3 in all solutions _ * @xmath30 is _ the probability that variable @xmath1 is false in clause @xmath3 in all solutions _ * @xmath31 is _ the probability that variable @xmath1 is true in clause @xmath3 in some solutions and false in others_.    note that there are here three transports for each directed link @xmath32 , from a variable to a clause , in the graph . as in bp ,",
    "these numbers will be functions of the influences from clauses to variables in the preceeding update step .",
    "taking again the incoming influences independent , we have @xmath33 the proportionality indicates that the probabilities are to be normalized .",
    "we see that the structure is quite similar to that in bp .",
    "but we can make it closer still by introducing @xmath11 with the same meaning as in bp . in sp",
    "it will then , as the case might be , be equal to to @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "that gives ( compare ( [ eq : scott - scaled - t - iterations ] ) ) : @xmath36 the update equations for @xmath11 are the same in sp as in bp , i.e. one uses ( [ eq : scott - scaled - i - iterations ] ) in sp as well .",
    "similarly to ( [ eq : single - bit - probabilities ] ) , decimation now removes the most fixed variable , i.e. the one with the largest absolute value of @xmath37 .",
    "given the complexity of the original derivation of sp  @xcite , it is remarkable that the sp scheme can be interpreted as a type of belief propagation in another belief system . and",
    "even more remarkable that the final iteration formulae differ so little .",
    "a modification of sp which we will consider in the following is to interpolate between bp @xmath38 and sp @xmath39   by considering equations @xmath40 we do not have an interpretation of the intermediate cases of @xmath41 as belief systems .",
    "early work on developing 3-sat heuristics discovered that as @xmath9 is increased , the problem changes from being easy to solve to extremely hard , then again relatively easy when the formulae are almost certainly unsat .",
    "it was natural to expect that a sharp phase boundary between sat and unsat phases in the limit of large @xmath0 accompanies this `` easy - hard - easy '' observed transition , and the finite - size scaling results of @xcite confirmed this .",
    "their work placed the transition at about @xmath42 .",
    "monasson and zecchina @xcite soon showed , using the replica method from statistical mechanics , that the phase transition to be expected had unusual characteristics , including `` frozen variables '' and a highly nonuniform distribution of solutions , making search difficult .",
    "recent technical advances have made it possible to use simpler cavity mean field methods to pinpoint the sat / unsat boundary at @xmath43 and suggest that the `` hard - sat '' region in which the solution space becomes inhomogeneous begins at about @xmath44 .",
    "these calculations also predicted a specific solution structure ( termed 1-rsb for `` one step replica symmetry - breaking '' ) @xcite in which the satisfiable configurations occur in large clusters , maximally separated from each other .",
    "two types of frozen variables are predicted , one set which take the same value in all clusters and a second set whose value is fixed within a particular cluster .",
    "the remaining variables are `` paramagnetic '' and can take either value in some of the states of a given cluster .",
    "a careful analysis of the 1-rsb solution has subsequently shown that this extreme structure is only stable above @xmath45 . between 3.92 and 4.15 a wider range of cluster sizes , and wide range of inter - cluster hamming distances",
    "are expected@xcite . as a result",
    ", we expect the values @xmath46 @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 to separate regions in which the nature of the 3-sat decision problem is distinctly different .",
    "[ fig : dependance - on - rho . ]    `` survey - induced decimation '' consists of using sp to determine the variable most likely to be frozen , then setting that variable to the indicated frozen value , simplifying the formula as a result , updating the sp calculation , and repeating the process .",
    "for @xmath50 we expect sp to discover that all spins are free to take on more than one value in some ground state , so no spins will be decimated . above @xmath47 ,",
    "sp ideally should identify frozen spins until all that remain are paramagnetic .",
    "the depth of decimation , or fraction of spins reminaing when sp sees only paramagnetic spins , is thus an important characteristic .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the fraction of spins remaining after survey - induced decimation for values of @xmath9 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 in hundreds of formulae with @xmath53 .",
    "the error bars show the standard deviation , which becomes quite large for large values of @xmath9 . to the left of @xmath42 ,",
    "on the descending part of the curves , sp reaches a paramagnetic state and halts . on the right , or ascending portion of the curves",
    ", sp stops by simply failing to converge .",
    "fig 1 also shows how different the behavior of bp and the hybrids between bp and sp are in their decimation behavior .",
    "we studied bp ( @xmath54 ) , underrelaxed sp ( @xmath55 ) , sp , and overrelaxed sp ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "bp and underrelaxed sp do not reach a paramagnetic state , but continue until the formula breaks apart into clauses that have no variables shared between them .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "1 that bp stops working at roughly @xmath57 , the point at which sp begins to operate .",
    "the underrelaxed sp behaves like bp , but can be used well into the rsb region . on the rising parts of all four curves in fig 1 ,",
    "the scheme halted as the surveys ceased to converge .",
    "overrelaxed sp in fig .",
    "1 may give reasonable recommendations for simplification even on formulae which are likely to be unsat .",
    "next we consider wsat , the random walk - based search routine used to finish the job of exhibiting a satisfying configuration after sp ( or some other decimation advisor ) has simplified the formula .",
    "the surprising power exhibited by sp has to some extent obscured the fact that wsat is itself a very powerful tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems , and has been widely used for this .",
    "its running time , expressed in the number of walk steps required for a successful search is also useful as an informal definition of the complexity of a logical formula .",
    "its history goes back to papadimitriou s",
    "@xcite observation that a subtly biased random walk would with high probability discover satisfying solutions in the simpler 2-sat problem after , at worst , @xmath58 steps .",
    "his procedure was to start with an arbitary assignment of values to the binary variables , then reverse the sign of one variable at a time using the following random process :    * select an unsatisfied clause at random * select at random a variable that appears in the clause * reverse that variable    this procedure , sometimes called rwalksat , works because changing the sign of a variable in an unsatisfied clause always satisfies that clause and , at first , has no net effect on other clauses .",
    "it is much more powerful than was proven initially .",
    "two recent papers  @xcite . have argued analytically and shown experimentally that rwalksat finds satisfying configurations of the variables after a number of steps that is proportional to @xmath0 for values of @xmath9 up to roughly @xmath59 , after which this cost increases exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig:2 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the power of sp comes from its use to guide decimation by identifying spins which can be frozen while minimally reducing the number of solutions that can be constructed . to assess the complexity of the reduced formulae that decimation guided in this way produces we compare , in fig .",
    "4 , the median number of wsat steps required to find a satisfying configuration of the variables before and after decimation . to a rough approximation , we can say that sp caps the cost of finding a solution to what it would be at the entry to the critical regime .",
    "there are two factors , the reduction in the number of variables that have to be searched , and the reduction of the distance the random walk must traverse when it is restricted to a single cluster of solutions . in fig .",
    "2c the solid lines show the wsat costs divided by n , the original number of variables in each formula .",
    "if we instead divide the wsat cost after decimation by the number of variables remaining , the complexity measure that we obtain is only a factor of two larger , as shown by the dotted lines .",
    "the relative cost of running wsat without benefit of decimation is 3 - 4 decades larger .",
    "we measured the actual compute time consumed in survey propagation and in wsat .",
    "for this we used the zecchina group s version 1.3 survey propagation code , and the copy of wsat ( h. kautz s release 35 , see  @xcite ) that they have also employed .",
    "all programs were run on a pentium iv xeon 3ghz dual processor server with 4 gb of memory , and only one processor busy .",
    "we compare timings from runs on the same 100 formulas with @xmath60 and @xmath61 and 4.2 ( the formulas are simply extended slightly for the second case ) . in the first case ,",
    "the 100 formulas were solved using wsat alone in 921 seconds . using sp to guide decimation one variable at a time , with the survey updates performed locally around each modified variable , the same 100 formulas required 6218 seconds to solve , of which only 31 sec was spent in wsat .",
    "when we increase alpha to 4.2 , the situation is reversed .",
    "running wsat on 100 formulas with @xmath60 required 27771 seconds on the same servers , and would have taken even longer if about half of the runs had not been stopped by a cutoff without producing a satisfying configuration .",
    "in contrast , the same 100 formulas were solved by sp followed with wsat in 10,420 sec , of which only 300 seconds were spent in wsat .",
    "the cost of sp does not scale linearly with @xmath0 , but appears to scale as @xmath62 in this regime .",
    "we solved 100 formulas with @xmath63 using sp followed by wsat in 39643 seconds , of which 608 sec was spent in wsat .",
    "the cost of running sp to decimate roughly half the spins has quadrupled , while the cost of the final wsat runs remained proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "decimation must stop short of the paramagnetic state at the highest values of @xmath9 , to avoid having sp fail to converge . in those cases we found that wsat could sometimes find satisfying configurations if started slightly before this point .",
    "we also explored partial decimation as a means of reducing the cost of wsat just below the 1-rsb regime , but found that decimation of small fractions of the variables caused the wsat running times to be highly unpredictable , in many cases increasing strongly . as a result ,",
    "partial decimation does not seem to be a useful approach .",
    "the sp and related algorithms are quite new , so programming improvements may modify the practical conclusions of the previous section .",
    "however , a more immediate target for future work could be the wsat algorithms .",
    "further directing its random choices to incorporate the insights gained from bp and sp might make it an effective algorithm even closer to the sat / unsat transition .",
