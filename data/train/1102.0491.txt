    "the discussion of the correct form of the energy - momentum tensor of electromagnetic waves in material media has been the subject of a hot debate for more than one century @xcite .",
    "the two most famous proposals were made by minkowski and abraham on the beginning of last century @xcite and have distinct predictions for the momentum of light in a medium .",
    "the abraham formulation predicts that an electromagnetic wave with total momentum @xmath0 in vacuum decreases its momentum to @xmath1 after entering a dielectric medium with refraction index @xmath2 , while the minkowski formulation predicts that the momentum of the wave is increased to @xmath3 after entering the medium .",
    "several experiments on this subject were made in the past 60 years @xcite , many of them with the purpose of solving the debate , but the fact is that no decision can be made on experimental grounds . as it was pointed out by penfield and haus @xcite , the abraham , minkowski and other electromagnetic energy - momentum tensors are accompanied by distinct material energy - momentum tensors . and when the properties of the material energy - momentum tensors are carefully taken into account , both formulations predict the same experimental results .",
    "a recent review of this debate can be seen in ref .",
    "the eventual conclusion is that there are many compatible ways of dividing the total energy - momentum tensor of the system into an electromagnetic tensor and a material one .",
    "nevertheless , we can ask whether there is , among all possible ways of dividing the momentum and the energy of electromagnetic waves in material media into electromagnetic and material parts , a division that could be considered as more natural . recently",
    ", many attempts have been made to calculate the momentum transfer from electromagnetic waves to material media directly from the lorentz force law @xcite .",
    "we believe that this is the most natural way of calculating the material momentum . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is presented a review of some treatments based on lorentz force calculations for experiments on the topic , showing that consistent results are obtained .",
    "we also believe that the most natural form for the material energy density is the sum of the potential and kinetic energy densities of the charges of the medium , which can be modified by the presence of an electromagnetic wave . the goal of this paper is to show , using reasonable models for material media , that if the material parts of the momentum density and of the energy density of electromagnetic waves in linear media are to be calculated in this way , the electromagnetic parts of the energy density @xmath4 , of the energy flux @xmath5 and of the momentum density @xmath6 must be @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the macroscopic electric field , @xmath9 the macroscopic magnetic field , @xmath10 the permittivity of free space and @xmath11 the permeability of free space .",
    "these forms are identical to the expressions in vacuum , but written in terms of the macroscopic fields .",
    "the form for the electromagnetic momentum density above had appeared before , for instance in the book of livens @xcite .",
    "however , the discussion of the energy of electromagnetic waves in linear media is practically absent from the literature .    in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] our proposal for the division is more carefully described and compared with previous treatments . in secs .",
    "[ sec : clas - diel ] , [ sec : quant - diel ] and [ sec : quant - mag ] different models for dispersive non - absorptive dielectric and magnetic media are shown to be consistent with the proposed material energy density . in sec .",
    "[ sec : flux ] we reproduce the model introduced by penfield and haus @xcite for the material energy flux and material momentum of an object with magnetic dipole moment in an applied electric field , showing the consistency of the division .",
    "this momentum of a magnetic dipole in an electric field is frequently called `` hidden momentum '' @xcite and is a relativistic effect . in recent papers ,",
    "barnett _ et al . _",
    "@xcite associated the minkowski momentum with the electromagnetic canonical momentum and the abraham momentum with the electromagnetic kinetic momentum .",
    "based on the model of penfield and haus , we suggest that the momentum density @xmath6 of eq .",
    "( [ mom em ] ) should be associated with the electromagnetic relativistic momentum . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present our concluding remarks .",
    "the microscopic lorentz force density that acts on a density charge @xmath12 moving with velocity @xmath13 , forming a current density @xmath14 , is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the microscopic electric and magnetic fields . if the separation between the charges in the medium is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic wave , we can associate averaged electric and magnetic fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 to volumes containing a huge number of particles , but still with dimensions much smaller than the radiation wavelength .",
    "the microscopic electric and magnetic fields can be written as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 depend on the microscopic distribution of charges and average to zero .",
    "so the averaged force density in this volume can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the averaged charge density and @xmath24 the averaged current density in the volume . in a linear medium without free charges , we can write @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the polarization and magnetization of the medium @xcite . the electric and magnetic macroscopic fields are the fields that appear on the lorentz force equation above , so these are the fields that can transfer momentum and energy to material macroscopic bodies . from our point of view , these should be the fields that transport electromagnetic energy and momentum .",
    "for this reason , these are the fields that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ energy em ] ) and ( [ mom em ] ) for the electromagnetic energy density , energy flux and momentum density .",
    "the abraham and minkowski momentum densities , on the other hand , are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the speed of light in vacuum @xcite .",
    "some of the previously cited papers that calculate the material momentum by the lorentz force consider that the electromagnetic momentum density should have the abraham value @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "our proposal for the electromagnetic momentum density of eq .",
    "( [ mom em ] ) agrees with the abraham form in a non - magnetic medium .",
    "as it was discussed by mansuripur @xcite , to have momentum conservation considering the abraham form for the electromagnetic momentum density in magnetic media , a modification must be done in the lorentz force law .",
    "mansuripur opts for this modification in the lorentz force to avoid the concept of `` hidden momentum '' , that we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : flux ] . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that the form of eq .",
    "( [ mom em ] ) for the electromagnetic momentum density and the form of eq .",
    "( [ lorentz ] ) for the lorentz force law are compatible with momentum conservation in a series of examples . ) .",
    "] we also showed compatibility with the balazs _ gedanken _ experiment @xcite , showing compatibility with the theory of relativity when taking into account the `` hidden momentum '' . because in our formulation there is no need for a modification in the lorentz force law , we believe that our treatment is more natural .",
    "now let us discuss the energy of electromagnetic waves in linear media .",
    "in a closed system , the local conservation of energy can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the total energy density and total energy flux of the system .",
    "for a system composed by an approximately monochromatic electromagnetic wave with frequency @xmath38 in a linear dispersive non - absorptive dielectric and magnetic medium , we can write @xcite @xmath39_{\\omega=\\omega_c }      \\frac{\\varepsilon_0\\langle|\\mathbf{e}|^2\\rangle}{2}+\\\\&&+\\left[1+\\frac{d(\\omega\\chi_\\mathrm{m})}{d\\omega}\\right]_{\\omega=\\omega_c }      \\frac{\\mu_0\\langle|\\mathbf{h}|^2\\rangle}{2}\\;,\\\\      \\mathbf{s}_{\\mathrm{tot } } = & & \\mathbf{e}\\times \\mathbf{h}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 represents the average of @xmath41 over one period of oscillation of the field , @xmath42 is the electric susceptibility and @xmath43 is the magnetic susceptibility of the medium .",
    "so , if the electromagnetic parts of the energy density and of the energy flux of electromagnetic waves in linear media are given by eq .",
    "( [ energy em ] ) , the material counterparts must be given by @xmath44_{\\omega=\\omega_c }      \\frac{\\varepsilon_0\\langle|\\mathbf{e}|^2\\rangle}{2}+\\\\&&+\\left[-\\alpha_\\mathrm{m}+\\omega\\frac{d\\alpha_\\mathrm{m}}{d\\omega}\\right]_{\\omega=\\omega_c }      \\frac{\\langle|\\mathbf{b}|^2\\rangle}{2\\mu_0}\\;,\\\\\\label{flux mat }      \\mathbf{s}_{\\mathrm{mat } } = & & -\\mathbf{e}\\times \\mathbf{m}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in the next three sections we show that commonly used models for dielectric and magnetic linear media acquire the energy density of eq .",
