    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the equivalence relation of _ commensurability _ of surface automorphisms .",
    "informally , two surface automorphisms are commensurable if they lift to automorphisms of a finite covering surface that have nontrivial common powers .",
    "equivalently , a surface automorphism determines a foliation of a @xmath0-manifold by closed surfaces , and two automorphisms are commensurable if their corresponding @xmath0-manifolds admit common finite covers for which the pulled - back foliations are isotopic .",
    "thus commensurability of surface automorphisms is a special case of the study of commensurability of @xmath0-manifolds equipped with a certain kind of geometric structure ; again informally , we call this commensurability relation _ fibered commensurability_.    the relation of commensurability of @xmath0-manifolds is well - studied , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) , @xcite and so on .",
    "when studying commensurability in a given context , the most important distinction to make is between those commensurability classes that admit _ finitely many _ minimal elements , and those that admit _ infinitely _ many .",
    "for example , amongst hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds , this is precisely the distinction between nonarithmetic and arithmetic commensurability classes , see e.g.   @xcite .",
    "this distinction has a cleaner statement if one is prepared to work in the category of orbifolds : each commensurability class of nonarithmetic hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds contains a unique minimal element .",
    "fibered commensurability is more rigid than ( ordinary ) commensurability .",
    "however , a given @xmath0-manifold can fiber in infinitely many different ways . for seifert manifolds",
    ", there is exactly one fibered commensurability class of surface bundles of all closed ( resp .  with torus boundary )",
    "seifert fibered manifolds whose fiber has negative euler characteristic , and this class contains infinitely many minimal elements .",
    "on the other hand , in the hyperbolic world we obtain the following theorem :    every commensurability class of hyperbolic fibered pairs contains a unique ( orbifold ) minimal element .",
    "an immediate corollary is that for a fibered hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 , each fibered commensurability class contains at most finitely many fibrations of @xmath2 ; hence @xmath2 has either one fibered commensurability class , or infinitely many fibered commensurability classes .",
    "the reducible case is more complicated :    there are examples of graph manifolds with infinitely many fibered commensurability classes , and a single graph manifold can fiber in infinitely many ways in a single commensurability class .",
    "as these results suggest , obstructions to commensurability of surface automorphisms arise from their behavior on pseudo - anosov orbits , and near their reducing systems .",
    "we describe such obstructions in detail .    in ",
    "[ definition - simple case ] , we give basic definitions and illustrate their meaning , in the special case of commensurability of spherical and toral automorphisms .",
    "we also recall the nielsen - thurston classification of surface automorphisms , and discuss a `` normal form '' for autormorphisms .",
    "this material is standard , and may be skipped by the expert .    in ",
    "[ hyperbolic_section ] , we study fibered commensurability of hyperbolic manifolds , and prove theorem  [ minimal_element_orbifold ] .",
    "we also list some commensurability invariants of pseudo - anosov automorphisms ( lemma  [ lambda - delta ] and proposition  [ spectrum_bounded_away_from_zero ] ) , and describe examples that illustrate their use .    finally ,   [ reducible_section ] and",
    "  [ graph_section ] are devoted to the case of reducible automorphisms , especially of graph manifolds . in   [ reducible_section ]",
    "we define certain numerical commensurability invariants for reducible maps ( theorem [ reducible ] , as well as proposition [ pi - lambda ] ) , and give many examples . in   [ graph_section ] we give examples of graph manifolds with infinitely many incommensurable fibrations , including one with boundary ( example  [ bounded ] ) that also admits infinitely many _",
    "commensurable _ ( but non - isomorphic ) fibrations , and a closed one ( example  [ closed ] ) that admits incommensurable fibrations of the same genus .",

    "we use the notation @xmath5 where @xmath4 is an automorphism of @xmath3 .    when @xmath3 has boundary , it is more usual to study isotopy classes of self - homeomorphisms fixed pointwise on the boundary .",
    "however , since we are interested in automorphisms which might permute boundary components , we adhere to this nonstandard convention .",
    "one surface automorphism can `` cover ''",
    "another in two distinct ways : either topologically ( in the sense that one surface covers the other ) or dynamically ( in the sense that one automorphism is a power of another ) .",
    "we consider covering in both senses in the sequel .",
    "more formally , we make the following definition .    a pair @xmath6 _ covers _",

    "commensurability of automorphisms is readily seen to be an equivalence relation , and is the main object of study in this paper .",

    "certain theorems in this paper are more elegantly stated and proved in this category .",
    "a basic reference for the theory of orbifolds is @xcite , chapter  13 .",
    "a _ fibered pair _ is a pair @xmath36 where @xmath2 is a compact @xmath0-manifold with boundary a union of tori and klein bottles , and @xmath37 is a foliation by compact surfaces .",

    "boundary points ) an orbifold fibered pair @xmath38 looks locally like the quotient of an open ball in @xmath42 ( resp .  a relatively open ball in a vertical half - space ) foliated by horizontal planes by a finite group of smooth foliation - preserving homeomorphisms .",
    "a surface automorphism @xmath5 determines a fibered pair whose underlying manifold is an @xmath3 bundle over @xmath1 with monodromy @xmath4 , and whose foliation is the foliation by surface fibers ( which are all homeomorphic to @xmath3 ) .",

    ", we can assume @xmath37 is co - orientable , in which case @xmath2 fibers over @xmath1 in such a way that the leaves of @xmath37 are the fibers .",
    "[ fibered_commensurable ] a fibered pair @xmath44 _ covers _",

    "thus , the category of fibered pairs enlarges the category of surface automorphisms in such a way that the definition of commensurability of a surface automorphism is the same , whichever category we use .    to stress that the definition of commensurability of fibered pairs depends on both the underlying @xmath0-manifold and the foliation",
    ", we call this equivalence relation _ fibered commensurability_.    the relation of covering is transitive , but it is not yet a partial order because of the existence of automorphisms of finite order .",
    "we must take such examples into account in order to define minimal elements with respect to commensurability .",
    "we say that two fibered pairs @xmath51 and @xmath52 are _ covering equivalent _ if each covers the other .",
    "call a covering equivalence class _ minimal _ if no representative covers any element of another covering equivalence class .",
    "the relation of covering descends to a transitive relation on covering equivalence classes , and defines a partial order on such classes .",

    "each covering equivalence class of fibered pairs @xmath53 $ ] contains exactly one fibered pair unless @xmath4 is periodic . in the periodic case , @xmath5 and @xmath54 are in the same covering equivalent class if and only if @xmath55 and both @xmath4 and @xmath25 generate the same finite cyclic group . with this understood ,",
    "in the sequel we are relaxed in our terminology , and use the word `` minimal element '' when we really mean `` minimal class '' .      for simplicity",
    ", we usually restrict attention to the case that @xmath3 ( and therefore @xmath2 ) is closed . however , because of the nature of the theory of surface automorphisms , to really understand this case we are forced to consider surfaces ( and @xmath0-manifolds ) with boundary , associated to the restrictions of automorphisms to invariant subsurfaces .",
    "evidently , the sign of @xmath56 is a commensurability invariant of @xmath5 . in the case of fibered pairs ( of good orbifolds )",
    ", all leaves have the same sign , so we can speak unambiguously about fibered pairs with spherical , euclidean , or hyperbolic leaves .",
    "we first discuss the situation when @xmath57 .",
    "there is one commensurability class consisting of the bundles @xmath58 and @xmath59 , each foliated by spheres , and @xmath60 which can be thought of as an @xmath61 bundle over a mirror orbifold .",
    "the elements @xmath59 and @xmath60 are minimal .",
    "the mapping class group of a torus is isomorphic to @xmath62 , and every automorphism has a linear representative .",
    "an automorphism can be periodic , reducible , or anosov",
    ". from elementary linear algebra , automorphisms in different classes are not commensurable .",
    "we discuss each case in turn .    1 .",
    "periodic case : there is only one commensurability class ; moreover there are exactly two minimal elements , corresponding to the periodic automorphisms of order 4 and 6 on a square and hexagonal torus respectively .",
    "2 .   reducible case : as automorphisms , each map @xmath63 is represented by a matrix which can be conjugated into the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 . so there is only one commensurability class and two minimal elements , corresponding to the conjugacy classes of matrices @xmath66 3 .   anosov case : the resulting sol manifolds are commensurable if and only if they are fibered commensurable , which occurs if and only if the logarithms of the dilatations of the automorphisms are commensurable as real numbers .",
    "hence there are infinitely many fibered commensurability classes .      in the remainder of the paper",
    "therefore we concentrate on the case of surfaces @xmath3 with @xmath67 . furthermore ,",
    "unless we explicitly say to the contrary , all surfaces @xmath3 are assumed to be compact and connected .",
    "a commensurability between automorphisms restricts to a commensurability between the underlying surfaces .",

    "this completes the proof .",
    "the most important fact we prove about commensurability of pseudo - anosov automorphisms  equivalently , of fibered commensurability of hyperbolic fibered pairs  is the existence of finitely many minimal elements in each commensurability class .",

    "then it is easy to see that for any pair @xmath139 commensurable with @xmath140 the group @xmath141 embeds into @xmath133 in such a way that @xmath139 covers @xmath38 .",
    "now we prove the claim .",
    "first , it is evident that @xmath133 preserves the stratification of @xmath134 into `` ordinary '' points ( those with a neighborhood isometric to an open set in sol ) and singular points ( those on the lifts of the singular flowlines of @xmath132 ) .",
    "moreover , any isometry between open subsets of sol must preserve the foliation by euclidean planes , as can be seen by appealing to the well - known structure of the point stabilizers in @xmath142 ; see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "since @xmath133 is equal to the group of isometries of the nonsingular part of @xmath134 , it follows that @xmath133 is a lie group , by the well - known theorem of myers - steenrod @xcite .",
    "hence if @xmath133 is not discrete , it must contain a continuous family of nontrivial isometries .",
    "such isometries can only act on the singular flowlines as translations .",
    "let @xmath143 and @xmath144 be two such flowlines , parameterized by length in such a way that @xmath143 and @xmath144 are contained in the same singular euclidean leaf of @xmath134 , for each @xmath145 . assume furthermore that for @xmath146 sufficiently small , the points @xmath143 and @xmath144 can be joined by a unique ( nonsingular ) euclidean geodesic in the singular euclidean leaf containing them .",
    "then for small @xmath145 , the length of this euclidean geodesic as a function of @xmath145 has the form @xmath147 for fixed @xmath148 and @xmath149 ; in particular , the length of this euclidean geodesic is not locally constant , and therefore ( since elements of @xmath133 preserve the foliation by singular euclidean planes ) a continuous family of isometries must fix @xmath150 and @xmath151 pointwise . but this implies that @xmath134 admits no continuous family of nontrivial isometries , and @xmath133 is discrete . since it contains @xmath129 ,",
    "it is therefore a lattice , as claimed .",
    "if @xmath3 is closed , @xmath134 with its singular sol metric and with its hyperbolic metric are quasi - isometric .",
    "consequently if @xmath152 are two flowlines , the distance function @xmath153 is proper on @xmath154 and therefore one obtains another proof that @xmath133 contains no nontrivial continuous family .",
    "a fibration of @xmath2 over a circle is determined by an element of @xmath155 , which is represented by a unique harmonic @xmath85-form @xmath156 in the hyperbolic metric on @xmath2 .",
    "a cover @xmath138 pulls back the harmonic @xmath85-form on @xmath2 to the corresponding harmonic @xmath85-form on @xmath134 ( up to scale ) , so one can give a slightly different proof of theorem  [ minimal_element_orbifold ] by using the pullback of this @xmath85-form to @xmath157 and arguing that its set of ( projective ) symmetries is discrete .",
