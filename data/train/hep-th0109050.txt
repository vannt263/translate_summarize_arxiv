    "however , for nonzero @xmath32 the solutions tending towards @xmath91 are not gauge modes and therefore represent a real gravitational instability .",
    "second , note that @xmath1 is insensitive to any component of @xmath3 tending towards @xmath91 , as may be seen from the expression @xmath92 for inflationary models , tracking @xmath1 , as is done in many analyses , is useful because the components that are projected out in this formula are harmless decaying modes .",
    "however , for the ekpyrotic model , the growing mode tends to @xmath91 .",
    "one can in fact recover the the growing mode solution from @xmath1 or @xmath60 , but special care has to be taken to do so , by keeping the next order terms in @xmath39 as we have done above .",
    "in this section we show that the variables @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : neweq ] ) and @xmath60 in eq .  ( [ eq : ueq ] ) at the heart of the analysis of the previous sections are in fact canonically conjugate .",
    "the importance of this is that in the @xmath93 phase space plane , the trajectories of the system are focused towards certain lines - for example the line @xmath94 in the case of the upside - down harmonic oscillator .",
    "these lines are then the classically amplified directions in phase space , and from liouville s theorem the phase space density is necessarily squeezed in the orthogonal directions .",
    "while the calculation of reference 5 is indeed correct , it does not by itself indicate the absence of a growing mode density perturbation , because the curvature perturbation which was computed is actually _ orthogonal _ to the direction in which fluctuations are amplified in the ekpyrotic setup .",
    "( we note that references [ lyth2 ] and [ branden ] agree with this conclusion ) .",
    "our starting point is the action for gravity plus a scalar field in canonical ( first order ) form .",
    "the relevant formulae may be found for example in ref .",
    "the newtonian potential @xmath3 is written in terms of @xmath59 , and @xmath1 is written in terms of @xmath60 as above .",
    "one finds the quadratic action for perturbations reduces to = 2 m_pl^2 p d ( v f + v",

    "the sum over all fourier modes is implicit .",
    "the action ( [ eq : act ] ) is in canonical form @xmath99 , with @xmath45 the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , up to normalization , @xmath60 and @xmath100 are canonically conjugate .",
    "the equations of motion are f=-^(v ^) k^2 v = ^- ( f ^) , [ eq : eoms ] which are just the relations above : equation ( [ eq : sol1 ] ) , which expresses @xmath3 in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath101 , and equation ( [ eq : zintp ] ) , which expresses @xmath1 in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath102 .",
    "these imply the equations of motion ( [ eq : feq ] ) and ( [ eq : ueq ] ) used in the previous sections .",
    "in the inflationary case , which corresponds to @xmath50 in the above analysis , both the variable @xmath60 and its canonical conjugate momentum @xmath100 ( or @xmath59 ) obey equations exhibiting a classical instability : both are amplified as @xmath53 approaches zero .",

    "thus there is no classical growth in @xmath1 , consistent with the finding of reference [ lyth0 ] .",
    "having established that there is indeed a growing mode scale - invariant spectrum of density perturbations in the collapsing phase , we now turn to the more challenging question of whether these perturbations survive the reversal to expansion .",
    "we have recently addressed the issue of reversal in a paper with n. seiberg@xcite , and we shall employ and extend the analysis of that paper here .    as we have discussed , the variable @xmath1 is not amplified in the collapsing phase , since it is insensitive to the growing mode perturbation .",
    "however , @xmath1 _ does _ yield the amplitude of the growing mode perturbation in the expanding phase . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath1 was in fact the correct variable to match at @xmath105 , the growing mode perturbation which developed in the collapsing phase would just match onto a pure decaying mode perturbation in the expanding phase .",
    "this has indeed been suggested by lyth in a follow - up paper following our communication of the above calculations to him @xcite .",
    "the new argument is essentially that perturbation evolution may reverse at collision .",
    "that is , @xmath3 began negligibly small , grew to be very large at the bounce but then , after reversal to expansion , @xmath3 shrank precisely back to zero .    in this section ,",
    "we wish to explain why matching @xmath1 across the bounce is not appropriate in the scenarios we consider . instead",
    ", we claim , the scale invariant growing mode spectrum generated in the contracting phase matches onto a linear combination of growing and decaying modes at reversal .",
    "consequently , the density perturbations survive the reversal of the scale factor to seed structure formation in the hot big bang .    in order to analyze matching at the bounce ,",
    "gauge invariant variables must be identified which are well - behaved as @xmath6 and @xmath53 approach zero .",
    "we have already seen that the growing mode solution for @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath106 , which is divergent as @xmath53 tends to zero .",
    "likewise , as discussed below , in the situation of interest , @xmath1 is logarithmically divergent .",
    "since linear perturbation theory can only be valid when the perturbation variables are small , it follows that @xmath1 is not a good matching variable .",
    "nevertheless , with careful treatment to exclude the logarithmic divergence , @xmath1 shall be very useful in the analysis after @xmath105 , just because it s ` long wavelength ' component is nearly constant in the expanding phase , and gives the amplitude of the growing mode linear density perturbation .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the potential @xmath7 in ( [ eq : pot ] ) can not hold as @xmath15 . in the main example we treat here",
    ", we instead assume @xmath7 bends upward so that @xmath107 as @xmath15 . in this case , just before collision the system is completely described as a massless scalar field coupled to gravity , in a collapsing universe . as discussed in ref",
    ". 4 , one can in this case define regular variables , in which the evolution through @xmath108 becomes well defined .    for the perturbation analysis , it is very important that , as @xmath109 , the universe is dominated by scalar field kinetic energy . in this situation ,",
    "a good perturbation variable is the fractional energy density perturbation on spatial slices which are comoving with the matter , termed @xmath110 by bardeen in his discussion of gauge invariant cosmological perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this variable ( defined in his equation 3.13 ) is a linear combination of the energy density perturbation @xmath111 , and the velocity perturbation @xmath112 , which is invariant under linearized coordinate transformations .",
    "it equals the energy density perturbation in any gauge in which the matter worldlines are orthogonal to the @xmath113constant hypersurfaces , and as bardeen emphasized it is the natural choice of perturbation amplitude from the point of view of the matter .",
    "the equations of motion for the matter , @xmath114 , lead to the following equations of motion , ( a^3 _ m)&=&-(+p)a^3 k v_s^(0)+h v_s^(0 ) & = & k + k ( 1+w ) ( c_s^2 _ m + w ) , [ eq : neweeq ] where @xmath115 is the gauge - invariant velocity perturbation defined by bardeen . here",

    "bardeen s potentials are related to our potential @xmath3 by @xmath120 . with these simplifications , and for the flat universe we consider , equations ( 4.5 ) and ( 4.8 ) of bardeen s paper@xcite reduce to ( [ eq : neweeq ] ) above .",

    ", this is unambiguously defined as time slice where @xmath0 tends to @xmath51 , or , re - phrased in terms of the brane separation , the time when @xmath123 .",
    "if we assume that no radiation is present in the contracting phase , so that the only energy density present is that in @xmath0 , then the surfaces of constant @xmath0 are also the comoving surfaces ( because the perturbation to the momentum is proportional to @xmath63 ) , and @xmath110 is the fractional energy density perturbation evaluated upon these surfaces .    at the bounce , we assume that there is a change in the internal state of the branes so that @xmath7 switches off and the boundary branes no longer attract .",

    "as we have emphasized , this is only suggestive at this stage , and will remain so in the absence of :    @xmath257 a microscopic check of the matching condition used for @xmath110 , within the context of m theory and string theory ,    @xmath257 a computation of the efficiency parameter @xmath206 describing the production of radiation on the branes ,    @xmath257 a check that the parameter @xmath258 is indeed small , as was assumed ,    @xmath257 and , a full calculation of a realistic inter - brane potential @xmath7 and a numerical solution of the equations improving the jump approximation used above .    although we have focused here on matching scalar perturbations , in principle one also needs a matching condition for tensor and vector modes .",
    "neither acquire long wavelength power in the contracting phase of the ekpyrotic model , and it seems unlikely they will be generated at the brane collision . nevertheless one can attempt to study possible matching conditions .",
    "it is not hard to see that the tensor amplitude @xmath259 exhibits the same logarithmic divergence as the perturbation in the three - curvature of comoving slices , @xmath1 .",
    "however , the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath260 does tend to a finite constant at @xmath105 , suggesting it provides a possible matching variable .",
    "again , establishing this will probably require a satisfactory microscopic theory .",
    "we have shown that inclusion of gravitational backreaction has a negligible effect on the density perturbations produced in the ekpyrotic universe , during the initial phase which is slowly contracting from the point - of - view of the four dimensional effective theory .",
    "we have proposed what we believe is a physically sensible matching condition at the bounce , based upon identifying physical perturbation variables which are well behaved ( i.e. small ) at @xmath105 , and matching on surfaces defined by the scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "the variables we used are well - behaved , we should emphasize , provided certain conditions are met as the 4d effective scale factor approaches zero , namely ( 1 )  the energy density is dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field ( the modulus @xmath0 in our case ) and ( 2 )  the inter - brane potential @xmath7 does not diverge as @xmath0 tends to @xmath51 .",
    "we showed that with the simplest matching prescription , namely matching the two linearly independent solutions at @xmath105 , the scale invariant spectrum of perturbations developed in @xmath3 early on in the contracting phase is generically passed on to the variable @xmath1 representing the amplitude of the long wavelength growing mode density perturbation in the expanding phase .",
    "we also identified examples where no density perturbations are generated in the final universe . if no radiation is generated at the brane collision , and if the potential vanishes sufficiently smoothly there , the perturbations ` time - reverse ' at @xmath108 and the amplitude of the growing mode perturbation is precisely zero in the final expanding universe .",
    "such examples are not realistic since there is no entropy generation at the brane collision , and in any case seem highly unlikely given that the outer - brane collision is not an adiabatic event .",
    "the existence of a ` zero - perturbation limit ' is an intriguing feature of the ekpyrotic model and the matching prescription given here , since it suggests a natural explanation for the smallness of the observed density perturbations .",
    "recall that a feature of inflation is that it naturally predicts a value of the density perturbation amplitude that is far too large , and fine - tuning of potentials is required to obtain a sufficiently small amplitude .",
    "we conclude that , while many issues connected to the microphysics at brane collision remain to be settled by rigorous investigation of string theory in the limit of outer - brane collision , the basic idea of ref .",
    "[ kost ] for producing density perturbations during the early stages of the ekpyrotic universe , in a phase which is slowly contracting from the four dimensional point of view , remains viable .",

    "the disagreement is due to different assumptions about physical conditions near the bounce , and to a different prescription for matching across it .",
    "we believe that the assumptions made by the authors of refs . 7 - 9 are inconsistent with what we proposed in refs . 1 and 4 , because    @xmath257 they use a scalar field potential which diverges to minus infinity as the bounce is approached .",
    "this potential is not compatible with the bounce prescription discussed in ref .",
    "4 , since it is too singular .",
    "@xmath257 they choose to match on a surface of constant energy density in the contracting phase , assuming that the scale factor of the universe reverses from contraction to expansion on this surface .",
    "this behavior is incompatible with the field equations describing the cosmological background solution .",
    "we instead follow the classical field equations all the way to the bounce , and apply a matching prescription consistent with our treatment of the background at this point . as we have explained above the appropriate matching surface in the ekpyrotic setup",
    "is defined by the scalar field specifying the inter - brane separation , and not by the energy density .",
    "@xmath257 brandenberger and finelli claim our matching prescription based on the energy density perturbation on slices of constant scalar field is inconsistent with results given in the literature for models where the equation of state undergoes a sudden jump@xcite .",
    "it is easy to see why matching @xmath110 and its time derivative in this situation is incorrect .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eq : perteq ] ) for @xmath110 involves @xmath136 , related by ( [ eq : relat ] ) to the time derivative of @xmath74 .",
    "hence , if @xmath74 jumps , @xmath136 acquires a delta function contribution , which causes a jump in @xmath176 across the matching point , which may be straightforwardly computed .",
    "the key point , however , is in the situation we are discussing , @xmath74 _ is continuous _ across the bounce , thus there are no such delta function contributions .",
    "therefore this ` counterexample ' is truly a red herring .",
    "@xmath257 brandenberger and finelli mistakenly imply that reversal from contraction to expansion would occur at a bulk brane - boundary brane collision .",
    "if the four dimensional effective description is valid , then reversal can _ only _ happen at a boundary brane - boundary brane collision , as described in ref .",
    "4 . in the four dimensional effective description",
    "the universe continues to contract after a bulk - boundary collision , so @xmath1 remains small and @xmath3 continues to grow .",
    "only when the outer boundary brane collision occurs as it must , can the growing perturbations in @xmath3 get converted to long wavelength fluctuations in @xmath1 .",

    "<S> we study the generation of density perturbations in the ekpyrotic scenario for the early universe , including gravitational backreaction . </S>",
    "<S> we expose interesting subtleties that apply to both inflationary and ekpyrotic models . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis includes a detailed proposal of how the perturbations generated in a contracting phase may be matched across a ` bounce ' to those in an expanding hot big bang phase . for the physical conditions relevant to the ekpyrotic scenario , we re - obtain our earlier result of a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of energy density perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the perturbation amplitude is typically small , as desired to match observation .    </S>",
    "<S> we recently proposed a novel scenario for the early universe in which the hot big bang is created by the collision between two m - theory branes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario assumes the universe begins in an almost static , nearly bps initial state consisting of empty , flat , parallel three - branes . in the effective 4d theory , </S>",
    "<S> the bps state is homogeneous and has zero spatial curvature . due to non - perturbative effects , however , a tiny force attracts the branes to one another . </S>",
    "<S> as the branes come together , quantum fluctuations create ripples in the brane surfaces that result in spatial variations in the time of collision . consequently , some regions heat up and begin to cool before others , producing a spectrum of long wavelength density perturbations which can seed structure formation in the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the perturbation spectrum using a ` time delay ' formalism@xcite , often used in simplified treatments of inflationary models . in that context , spatial variations in the time when inflation ends result in long wavelength density inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> we applied the same formalism to variations in the time of collision in the ekpyrotic scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the equation for fluctuations in the scalar field @xmath0 describing the inter - brane separation in the ekpyrotic model is almost identical to that describing fluctuations in the inflaton during slow - roll inflation . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations is found . </S>",
    "<S> the result is remarkable because it shows that the harrison - zeldovich spectrum can be obtained without inflation in a space - time which is very nearly static minkowski space .    </S>",
    "<S> the time delay formalism is a crude approximation , and only quantitatively accurate for a small class of inflationary potentials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it often gives a good estimate of the spectral index for the power spectrum of perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> one of the goals of this paper is to investigate whether the same statement is true for the ekpyrotic model .    in the case of the ekpyrotic model </S>",
    "<S> , there is the major complication that the perturbations are produced when the effective 4d scale factor is contracting . in order to have a viable scenario , </S>",
    "<S> a mechanism must be found to reverse from contraction to expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this issue has been addressed in a recent paper we have written with n. seiberg@xcite , where we argue that such a ` bounce ' may be allowed in the context of m - theory , where it corresponds to a collision and rebound of the outer boundary branes . a matching rule linking the homogeneous background variables of the contracting phase to those describing the expanding phase </S>",
    "<S> was suggested there . assuming this proposal is valid , what remains is to apply and extend those ideas to describe the evolution of perturbations through the moment of reversal .    </S>",
    "<S> a stimulus for the present work was a paper by d. lyth@xcite , which calculated the growth of the perturbation variable @xmath1 ( also commonly termed @xmath2 ) representing the curvature perturbation of spatial slices which are comoving with the matter . </S>",
    "<S> lyth correctly showed that @xmath1 was not amplified in the contracting phase of the ekpyrotic universe . </S>",
    "<S> he claimed this implied that when gravitational back - reaction was included , the spectrum of density perturbations became strongly scale - dependent with negligible power on large scales , making the ekpyrotic scenario incompatible with observations . </S>",
    "<S> his analysis employed a certain class of analytically solvable models with exponential potentials , previously used to describe power law inflation@xcite and simply extended to the situation of slow contraction relevant to the ekpyrotic scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we repeat his analysis here , but also compute the perturbation in the newtonian potential @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the contracting phase gravitational back - reaction actually enhances rather than suppresses long wavelength fluctuations , but these fluctuations show up purely in @xmath3 and not in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore gravitational back - reaction does not spoil the ekpyrotic mechanism , at least in the contracting phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the remaining issue regards the appropriate matching condition for tracking the perturbations across the bounce and into the expanding hot big bang . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with the arguments of ref . 4 </S>",
    "<S> , we seek to identify variables which are non - singular at the bounce , both for the background and perturbation variables . </S>",
    "<S> we then match the amplitudes of the two linearly independent solutions for the perturbation variables across the bounce . with our prescription , we find that the long wavelength perturbations developed in the contracting phase do indeed survive to the expanding phase , provided there is a change in the equation of state at the bounce , such as occurs if a sub - dominant component of radiation is produced there . </S>",
    "<S> our final expression for the density perturbation spectrum agrees well with the more naive time delay estimate .    after communicating a preliminary version of this paper to lyth and r. brandenberger , </S>",
    "<S> lyth prepared a second manuscript@xcite proposing that contraction be matched to expansion on a time - slice of fixed energy density@xcite . with this procedure </S>",
    "<S> , he argues that the curvature perturbation @xmath1 is conserved across the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> but since @xmath1 does not acquire a scale invariant spectrum in the contracting phase , he argues that @xmath1 will not have such a spectrum in the expanding phase , where it represents the amplitude of growing mode adiabatic perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> lyth s conclusion is that any growing mode density perturbations developed in the contracting phase match perfectly onto pure decaying mode perturbations in the expanding phase . </S>",
    "<S> brandenberger and finelli@xcite , and hwang@xcite , have recently produced preprints repeating this argument . in a note </S>",
    "<S> added , at the end of this paper , we explain why we do not believe these conclusions are valid for the ekpyrotic scenarios proposed in refs . 1 and 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us outline our approach to the matching problem . </S>",
    "<S> we want to evolve background and perturbation variables according to the appropriate field equations , all the way to to zero scale factor in the four dimensional effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a complete set of variables which are non - singular at the bounce , and match those non - singular variables across it . </S>",
    "<S> this prescription automatically excludes the variables @xmath3 and @xmath1 , both of which diverge . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , geometrical quantities such as the synchronous gauge comoving metric perturbation @xmath4 also diverge . indeed </S>",
    "<S> the meaning of the three - geometry is unclear at zero scale factor .    </S>",
    "<S> instead our approach is essentially algebraic rather than geometrical . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on gauge invariant perturbation variables which are consistently small at all times and match these across the bounce at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this matching would give consistent results for an infinite class of perturbation variables so defined . </S>",
    "<S> our prescription can only be fully justified by a satisfactory microscopic description of the relevant degrees of freedom . nevertheless , if string theory shows that the scale factor can truly pass through zero and bounce , then tracking perturbative gauge - invariant degrees of freedom which remain small and finite seems likely to be the right approach to matching fluctuations across the bounce .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shall be performed entirely within the context of four dimensional effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> this does not capture all the low energy degrees of freedom relevant to the five ( or indeed eleven ) dimensional brane - world . </S>",
    "<S> as in ref . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we shall assume those other degrees of freedom are frozen , or at least so slowly varying that their inclusion would not substantially alter the result . </S>",
    "<S> we shall focus here on single moduli field @xmath0 which determines the outer brane separation in a brane - world universe . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we considered a model in which the perturbations are produced by the collision of a bulk brane with one of the boundary branes . as we pointed out there , if the 4d effective theory is valid , the scale factor in that theory must continue to contract until the outer branes collide and bounce . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we suggested a simplified model in which there is only one collision between the boundary branes and no bulk brane is needed . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbations are produced as the outer branes approach one another . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , here we shall restrict ourselves to this two - brane scenario , in which the same scalar field @xmath0 is responsible both for the development of the perturbations , and for describing the the outer - brane collision and bounce . </S>",
    "<S> generalizations to bulk - boundary collisions , as in the original scenario of ref . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , are a straightforward extension and will be briefly mentioned when appropriate .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of this paper is as follows . in section </S>",
    "<S> i we discuss the properties of the inter - brane potential relevant to the ekpyrotic scenario , an issue referred to again in the note added at the end of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we then review the application of the time delay formalism to the ekpyrotic scenario , as described in ref . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , showing that a scale invariant spectrum of fluctuations is naturally predicted . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii , we show that including gravitational back - reaction has , in newtonian gauge , only negligible effects on the fluctuations acquired by the scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> section iii is devoted to a discussion of the role of the curvature perturbation @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) conventionally used in the analysis of inflationary models , which is in fact insensitive to the growing mode perturbation in the contracting phase of the ekpyrotic model . </S>",
    "<S> this is further elaborated in section iv where we show that @xmath1 is canonically conjugate to the direction of amplification , which is proportional to the variable @xmath3 . as a consequence of liouville s theorem , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is ` squeezed ' as the perturbations develop during the collapsing phase of the ekpyrotic scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> section v addresses the key moment of reversal , which is when , in the four dimensional effective description , the universe ` bounces ' as the scale factor @xmath6 hits zero . </S>",
    "<S> since the four dimensional spacetime geometry is singular there , a four dimensional geometrical description using the einstein frame metric is inappropriate . </S>",
    "<S> however , our approach is to identify a complete set of dynamical variables which remain finite at the bounce and to match them at the transition from contraction to expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we ignore divergent quantities as unphysical , attributing their bad behavior to a singular choice of field and metric variables . </S>",
    "<S> we used this approach in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nonsing ] to describe the homogeneous background evolution during the bounce . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that there is also a set of gauge invariant linear perturbation variables which are well - behaved at the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> when the theory is formulated in these variables , there is a well defined matching prescription , even in the four dimensional effective field theory , which seems to yield physically sensible results .    in order for the well - behaved variables to exist , we emphasize that it is important to have two conditions : ( 1 )  there must be a free scalar field ( the modulus @xmath0 in our case ) whose kinetic energy diverges at the bounce and ( 2 ) the scalar potential @xmath7 must be sufficiently non - singular at the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest case is where @xmath7 approaches zero at the bounce , as suggested by the mapping from m - theory to weakly coupled string theory@xcite . if these two conditions are fulfilled , then it is possible to follow the perturbations and match at @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> our main finding , in sections v and vi , is that as long as radiation is produced or fields are excited at the outer - brane collision so that there is a jump in the first or second time derivative of the equation of state parameter @xmath9 , the scale invariant perturbation spectrum developed during the contracting phase propagates through the bounce and into the final expanding universe . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the final density perturbation amplitude derived in section vi is naturally suppressed by a small numerical coefficient , by quantities which are automatically small in horava - witten theory , and by factors involving the efficiency with which brane kinetic energy is converted into radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on how this suppression may naturally explain the small perturbation amplitude @xmath10 we see via observations of the cosmic microwave sky in the universe today . </S>"
