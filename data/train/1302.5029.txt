    "one of the central mysteries of glass formation is the origin of the dramatic increase of relaxation times approaching the glass transition temperature , @xmath0 , which is commonly interpreted as an increase of the effective activation energy  @xcite .",
    "since the low temperature ( @xmath1 ) activation energy typically exceeds the energy of a chemical bond , it is natural to associate this activation process with the reorganization of multiple atoms or molecules .",
    "indeed , there is general agreement that glass - forming liquids are dynamically heterogeneous , exhibiting a significant fraction of particles with extreme high or low mobility relative to the mean , whose positions are spatially correlated  @xcite .    even before the phenomenology of dynamical heterogeneity",
    "was clearly established , adam and gibbs  @xcite ( ag ) suggested a molecular picture of this kind in 1965 , along with specific predictions for the relation of the configurational entropy @xmath2 to the relaxation dynamics .",
    "in particular , they proposed that reorganization in a liquid occurs _ via _ hypothetical `` cooperatively rearranging regions '' ( crr ) , where the activation energy for relaxation is extensive in the number of atoms or molecules that make up the crr .",
    "the ag model attributes the rapid growth of relaxation time approaching @xmath0 to the progressive growth of the crr size on cooling .",
    "however , the ag theory does not include a microscopic description of the crrs , or a concrete prescription for identifying them .",
    "ag further argued that the configurational entropy per crr is roughly independent of temperature so that the crr mass is inversely proportional to the configurational entropy of the fluid  a quantity that can be estimated experimentally by the difference of the total and vibrational entropies .",
    "consequently , the entropy formulation of the ag theory postulates that the temperature - dependent activation energy for relaxation is inversely proportional to @xmath2 ( the `` adam - gibbs relationship '' ) .",
    "this model has proven to be highly successful to describe the @xmath1 dependence of relaxation in both experiments  @xcite ( where @xmath2 is estimated from specific heat measurements ) and computational studies  @xcite ( where @xmath2 can be formally evaluated from an energy landscape approach ) .",
    "the random first - order transition ( rfot ) theory  @xcite is based upon similar ideas to rationalize the rapid growth of relaxation time on cooling . in particular",
    ", the rfot theory formulates the problem of the relaxation in glass - forming liquids in terms of an `` entropic droplet model '' , or `` mosaic '' picture , in which the liquid is divided into metastable regions with a characteristic size @xmath3 .",
    "the balance between the surface and bulk free energies of these regions predicts a scaling relation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 . the overall barrier for relaxation is also assumed to scale with @xmath3 , providing a generalized relationship between @xmath2 and relaxation .",
    "notably , the ag relationship can be recovered by an appropriate limit of rfot , so that these models are potentially directly linked .",
    "as in the case of the ag theory , rfot theory does not provide a specific molecular definition of the length scale of collective motion .",
    "thus , both the ag and rfot approaches leave the precise nature of cooperative rearrangements and their relation to dynamical heterogeneity open to interpretation and quantification .",
    "computer simulations have been particularly helpful to quantify the nature of dynamical heterogeneity , as the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of glass - forming fluids is difficult to probe directly with experiments .",
    "it is now appreciated that atoms or molecules of extreme mobility ( or immobility ) tend to cluster , and that the most mobile clusters can be further divided into groups of atoms or molecules that move cooperatively in a roughly co - linear , or string - like fashion  @xcite , and this phenomenon has been confirmed experimentally in colloidal particle tracking measurements .",
    "consistent with the ideas of the ag and rfot theories , the sizes of clusters and strings grow on cooling toward @xmath0 , but it is not clear if either of these structures are appropriate measures of the size scales envisioned by these theories .",
    "earlier works have considered both the possibilities of using the mobile particle clusters or the strings as the crr of ag , and each of these studies indicated promising results  @xcite .",
    "we should point out that there are other ways to characterize the length scales of heterogeneity .",
    "in particular , the use of a four - point correlation function offers an approach rooted in the framework of statistical mechanics that reveals a growing dynamical length scale on cooling  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we systematically dissect cluster and string - like nature of the heterogenous motion in a model glass - forming polymer melt , and then consider what measure or measures of dynamical heterogeneity , if any , may appropriately quantify the size scales envisioned by the ag or rfot approaches . in doing so , we expand on a general methodology to identify subsets of extreme immobility .",
    "our results span a broad temperature range , from very high @xmath1 , to somewhat below the crossover temperature @xmath4 often associated with mode - coupling theory .",
    "we find that , at the characteristic time of maximal clustering , the structures of mobile and immobile clusters exhibit statistical properties that are consistent with the properties of equilibrium branched polymers , which are the same as clusters approaching a percolation transition ( lattice animals ) .",
    "when mobile clusters are decomposed into strings , the geometry of short strings are consistent with self - avoiding walks , while larger strings ( that appear at low temperature ) behave like simple random walks .",
    "we find that none of the cluster types that we study form compact objects when examined at their respective characteristic times .",
    "moreover , the characteristic times of mobile and immobile clusters provide a physically transparent way to understand decoupling phenomena , as the mobile cluster time scales have essentially the same temperature dependence as diffusive time scales , while the immobile cluster time scale follows the structural relaxation time .",
    "we consider both mobile clusters and strings as possible descriptions of crr in the ag and rfot models , and find that the strings  which necessarily incorporate large mobility and cooperativity of displacement  best accord with the quantitative description of the mass or length scales of cooperative clusters described by both these theories .",
    "our results are primarily based on molecular dynamics simulations of a melt containing 400 chains of `` bead - spring '' polymers , each chain consisting of 20 monomers  @xcite . at this length ,",
    "the chains are unentangled .",
    "all monomers interact via a force - shifted lennard jones ( lj ) potential , truncated at 2.5@xmath5 so that dispersive attractions are included ( @xmath5 is the lj length parameter ) .",
    "neighboring monomers along a chain also interact via a fene spring potential to create covalent bonds .",
    "the fene parameters are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , chosen to create a mismatch in the length scale of bonded and non - bonded interactions , thus frustrating crystallization and making the model a good glass former  @xcite .",

    "for all @xmath13 , we perform five independent simulations to improve statistics .",
    "each simulation consists of an equilibration run followed by data collection ; the duration of each run is determined from the @xmath14 relaxation time ( discussed below ) to ensure we sample only equilibrium states .",
    "temperature is controlled via the nose - hoover algorithm , which is implemented via the rrespa method using a time step of 0.002 for bond forces with 3 updates for each non - bonded force update  @xcite .",

    "since we will examine in detail the spatial heterogeneity of the segmental dynamics , we also evaluate the non - gaussian parameter @xmath36 as a basic indicator of the time scale and strength of correlated motion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fqt+alpha2](b ) ) .",
    "the peak of @xmath36 defines the time @xmath21 , which provides a characteristic time scale of the spatially heterogeneous motion .",
    "the amplitude of the peak of @xmath36 also increases , a consequence of the increasing degree of spatial correlations of the motion .",
    "although it is not explicitly documented , it is implicit from many previous works  @xcite that @xmath21 grows less rapidly than @xmath18 on cooling , as confirmed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fqt+alpha2](b ) .",
    "in other words , these characteristic times `` decouple '' .",
    "this can be expected since @xmath21 is a diffusive time scale ( see appendix  [ app : non - gaussian ] ) , and the diffusion coefficient @xmath27 has long been known to decouple from structural relaxation .",
    "@xcite ag never envisioned that glass - forming liquids should be characterized by multiple relaxation times ; consequently , they did not distinguish between mass diffusion and momentum diffusion ( _ i.e. , _",
    "viscous relaxation ) , but their language clearly relates to modeling mass diffusion . fortunately , since these time scales maintain a fractional power - law relation over a large range extending from @xmath0 to @xmath37 , the ag ( or rfot ) approaches can be equally applied to either mass or momentum diffusion , a point that we expand upon below .",
    "it is widely appreciated that , below the onset temperature @xmath37 , the dynamics become increasingly spatially heterogeneous approaching @xmath0 .",
    "regions with either enhanced mobility or diminished mobility form in a spatially correlated manner , and the motions within mobile regions can be further dissected into more elementary groups that move in a string - like , cooperative fashion . in this section ,",
    "we examine several ways to characterize correlations in mobility and analyze the geometry of these structures .      since the distribution of particle mobilities varies continuously ,",
    "the first challenge is how to distinguish mobility subsets . for a variety of systems",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that choosing the subset of particles that that have moved farther than is expected from the gaussian approximation at the characteristic time @xmath21 offers a useful metric to identify the highly - mobile particles .",
    "depending on the system , these mobile particles typically account for 5  % to 7 % of the particles below @xmath37 .",
    "this is also true for the present system , confirmed in our own calculations and in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we follow the choice of ref .",
    "@xcite where the same model was examined , and select mobile particles as the 6.5  % of particles with the greatest displacement over any chosen interval @xmath38 .",
    "this allows us so see the evolution of mobile particle properties over all @xmath38 , in addition to the characteristic time @xmath21 .    at the other mobility extreme , we identify particles of extreme _",
    "immobility_. while a variety of methods to identify low mobility particles have been explored in past literature  @xcite , there is considerable variation in the details of these approaches .",
    "moreover , many studies of immobile particles do not condition the selection on mobility , but rather on local packing considerations ( _ e.g. _ , icosahedral packing , frank - kasper clusters , a sufficient number of neighbors _ etc . _ ) .",
    "such attempts are potentially valuable for relating structure to dynamical behavior , but in the present work we wish focus purely on dynamical considerations that should be applicable to characterizing mobility all glass - forming liquids , rather than any particular fluid having its own unique type of local ordering .",
    "consequently , we have developed a criterion for immobile particles based on the tendency for `` caged particles '' to cluster .",
    "we provide a detailed description of the method in appendix  [ appendix : immobile ] to avoid breaking the flow of our main results . broadly speaking , we can identify caged particles for any time @xmath38 by those particles with displacements smaller than the ( weakly @xmath1-dependent ) plateau value observed in the mean - squared displacement .",
    "we then find the time at which these caged particles form the largest clusters and evaluate what fraction of the system these caged particles constitute .",
    "similar to the approach for mobile - particle clusters , we fix this fraction for all @xmath38 to track the evolution of the clustering of the immobile particles .",
    "note that the fraction of immobile particles from this method is @xmath1-dependent , increasing from @xmath39  5  % at the lowest @xmath1 studied up to 11  % at @xmath37 . above @xmath37 ,",

    "since the caging of particles by their neighbors is one of the hallmarks of glass formation , we utilize the concept of `` caged particles '' .",
    "to do so , we must identify the cage size .",
    "we can formally do this via the mean - squared displacement @xmath166 .",
    "[ fig : cagesize](a ) shows that @xmath166 has a plateau at a characteristic size in the approximate range 0.04 to 0.09 ( for a cage radius 0.2 to 0.3 ) . to precisely define the cage size , we take advantage of the fact that the logarithmic derivative @xmath167 exhibits a clear minimum on the time scale of particle caging , @xmath168 .",
    "we thus define the cage size by @xmath169 .",
    "we show the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath170 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cagesize](b ) for @xmath139 ; at higher @xmath1 , @xmath166 transitions from ballistic motion ( @xmath171 ) to sub - diffusive motion ( @xmath172 without intervening particle caging .",

    "[ fig : caged - fraction ] shows the fraction of caged particles , which , as expected , decreases with time .",
    "we note that , formally , this fraction is identical to the `` self - overlap ''",
    "@xmath176 used in the four - point correlation function formalism  @xcite , although the particle `` size '' used is typically fixed at a value 0.3 , independent of @xmath1 , and substantially larger than the cage size at low @xmath1 .",
    ".,width=307 ]    since we wish to understand the tendency for these caged particles to be spatially correlated , we evaluate the average cluster size of these immobile particles .",
    "however , we must take into account the fact that the number of these caged particles decreases with time , and thus there is a trivial effect on the cluster size of the number of caged particles . to remove this trivial effect ,",
    "we normalize the caged particle cluster size by the cluster size of the same fraction of particles chosen at random ; this allows us to see how the tendency to cluster compares to the random case , independent of the nature of the underlying dynamics .    , where the cage is well - defined.,width=307 ]    figure  [ fig : caged - clusters ] shows the normalized cluster size of the caged particles as a function of time .",
    "the qualitative behavior matches what we observe for other dynamical clusters : as smaller times , the effect of clustering is weak , and there is a characteristic time where the cluster size reaches a peak . as discussed in the main text , this characteristic time is similar to the @xmath14-relaxation time .",
    "this time , along with the peak size of the caged - clusters , define the characteristic features that we wish to capture .",
    ".,width=307 ]    to simplify the analysis of immobile particles and draw a parallel to the analysis of the mobile particles ( where there is a fixed , @xmath38-independent fraction of particles considered ) , we consider a simplification of this approach that still captures the characteristic peak time and amplitude of caged particles . specifically ,",
    "if we look at the characteristic peak time of the caged particles , we can identify the fraction of caged particles at this time , which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : immob - fraction ] .",
    "this characteristic fraction of caged particles increases with @xmath1 , as the mobility subsets become less distinct at higher @xmath1 .",
    "for all subsequent analysis , we use this @xmath1-dependent fraction for all time , to parallel the approach for the mobile particles . by construction",
    ", this fixed fraction reproduces the characteristic time and size the our time - dependent fraction of caged - particles reveals , so that we do not alter these important features .",
    "a natural concern is the sensitivity of this approach to the definition of the cage size , since this is the only parameter that must somehow be chosen . to test this",
    ", we also considered a @xmath1-independent cage size @xmath175 of 0.2 or 0.25 .",
    "we find that these @xmath1 independent sizes of course yield quantitatively different results , but that the time and size scales of the immobile particles all scale in the same way . additionally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : immob - fraction ] , the characteristic fraction of caged particles is nearly the same as our definition based on a @xmath1-dependent cage size , showing the precise definition of cage size does not strongly affect the characteristic immobile fraction .",

    "[ fig : immob - fraction ] , and find that we recover nearly the same fraction by this approach .",
    "apparently , the characteristic fraction of immobile particles is not strongly sensitive to the exact choice of parameters , providing confidence in the robustness of our analysis . for the calculations presented in the main body of the manuscript",
    ", we simply use the mean of all these estimates .",
    "finally , we point out that in all approaches to identify low mobility particles , there appears to be an unanticipated feature at @xmath177 , previously estimated as the characteristic @xmath4 for this system at this density  @xcite .",

    "in this method , the free energy is calculated by parametrically coupling the potential energy of the system @xmath182 to the potential energy @xmath183 of a reference system for which the free energy can be directly , analytically evaluated .",
    "the coupling potential is normally of the form @xmath184 where the coupling parameter @xmath185 .",
    "the free energy can then be evaluated by @xmath186    this procedure is complicated by the fene potential that bonds nearest neighbors , since it diverges as the bond length approaches @xmath187 .",
    "the normally chosen reference potentials do not restrain the bond length , and so the contribution from the fene potential diverges strongly as @xmath188 .",
    "the avoid this complication , we perform a `` two - step '' thermodynamic integration , where we first perform an integration from the fene potential to a harmonic bond potential @xmath189 that does not exhibit the strong divergence as bond length grows ; when then perform an integration from the harmonically bonded polymer to the reference system .",
    "we choose @xmath190 and @xmath191 so that the location of the minimum and the curvature at the minimum are very near to that of the fene bond ( when combined with the core lj repulsion ) .",
    "while the free energy for the harmonically bonded polymer is not analytically known , it is not needed , as it drops out in the final expression for the free energy @xmath192    for the reference potential , we use a potential that shares the system periodicity  @xcite , namely @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the amplitude of the potential , @xmath85 is the length of the container and @xmath195 is the coordinate of a particle in direction @xmath74 . for an @xmath196 particle system interacting through @xmath183 , evaluation of the partition function",
