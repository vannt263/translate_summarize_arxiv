    "multi - antenna systems have been known @xcite to offer considerable advantages , not only at the link - level , providing higher multiplexing gains and increased robustness through diversity , but also at a system - level by allowing a more effective interference mitigation in a multi - user setting .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that next generation wireless communications systems will include multi - antenna systems @xcite in order to capitalize on these benefits . to obtain the full advantages from multiple antennas ,",
    "it is necessary to have an optimal receiver structure , which however is quite complex to implement in real systems .",
    "instead , low complexity , albeit suboptimal , linear receivers offer a practical alternative .",
    "such receivers include the so - called mmse ( minimum mean square error ) and the zero - forcing ( zf ) receivers , as well as a new class of receivers recently proposed @xcite called moment - based receivers .",
    "in addition to the simplification due to the linearization of the received signal operation , the received signal may then be iteratively treated to cancel the interference from other antennas . however , in many cases , even this may impose significant complexity .",
    "an even simpler receiver structure can be constructed , in which , after the linear spatial equalization the data is decoded in a single - input single - output fashion@xcite . here",
    "we will focus on the latter , especially since we are interested in the cellular context , with separated transmitter antenna arrays in the uplink with a multi - antenna receiver terminal .",
    "the throughput performance depends on the ability of the linear receiver structure to mitigate interference .",
    "one very useful method to quantify the performance is through the asymptotic analysis of the signal to interference and noise ratio ( sinr ) for the receiver in the limit of large antenna numbers using tools from random matrix theory .",
    "its application was initially spearheaded in the context of direct - sequence code - division - multiple - access ( ds - cdma ) where the effective channel consists of the matrix of pseudorandom codes . in this direction ,",
    "the first breakthrough was made by @xcite , who showed that in the infinite matrix - size limit the sinr of a fixed random channel realization converges to its mean .",
    "later , similar results were obtained for more general channels @xcite .",
    "more recently , the effectiveness of linear receivers were analyzed in terms of the total throughput from all transmitting nodes in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one often needs to assume that the fading channel is `` quasi - static '' , i.e. varies in time much more slowly than the typical coding delay . in this case",
    "the channel matrix and hence the sinr have to be considered as random quantities . in this regime ,",
    "the relevant performance metric is the `` rate ( or sinr ) versus outage probability '' tradeoff @xcite , captured by the cumulative distribution function of the sinr .",
    "this situation is especially relevant in the context of multi - antenna channels , when the number of antennas is usually much smaller than the size of the cdma codes .    in a seminal work",
    "@xcite the authors proved the asymptotic normality of the sinr for the mmse and zf receivers when all transmitters have equal power .",
    "the normality of the sinr was later extended to the normality of the multiple access interference ( mai ) of cdma channels @xcite and a variety of linear receivers @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed the normality of the mmse sinr , including the case of the mismatched receiver .",
    "interestingly , @xcite showed also that the logarithm of the sinr becomes asymptotically normal . unfortunately , and in contrast to the total mutual information , the gaussian approximation for the sinr is extremely inaccurate , unless the number of antennas is quite large .",
    "as a result , inspired by the fact that the sinr for the equal power mimo zf receiver has a gamma distribution@xcite , several works were devoted to approximating the sinr statistics with other distributions , such as the beta distribution for the sinr of the cdma zf receiver @xcite , or the gamma and generalized gamma distributions @xcite , in which case their first three moments were fitted to match the actual sinr distribution . nevertheless , this methodology , although perhaps providing good agreement under certain conditions , is ad - hoc and does not offer any intuition on the sinr statistics .",
    "the same can be argued for the calculation of the exact probability density function ( pdf ) and the cumulative density function ( cdf ) of the mmse sinr @xcite using ratios of determinants , a method however which is only valid for uncorrelated channels at the receiver .    in this paper , we take a different approach . instead of trying to prove gaussian behavior close to the peak of the distribution of sinr , we develop a large - deviations methodology , which allows us to calculate the distribution of the sinr arbitrarily far from its most probable , mean value .",
    "the success of our method lies on the fact that we can exactly express the moment generating function ( mgf ) of the sinr as the moment generating function of the difference of two correlated mimo mutual information functions . taking advantage of the robustness of the gaussian approximation of the mimo mutual information we obtained an expression of the mgf of the sinr correct to @xmath1 .",
    "we are then able to obtain the full distribution of the sinr for both mmse and zf with similar precision .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that our results are very close to the exact ones down to the smallest mimo systems ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning a related recent work @xcite in which we used the coulomb gas method @xcite to calculate the leading term @xmath3 in the exponent of the sinr for uncorrelated channels . in that work",
    "we demonstrate that the large deviations tails are determined by the behavior of a single singular value of the channel matrix .    _",
    "outline : _ in the next section we present the channel model and introduce the mmse and the zf sinr . in section [ sec : technical ] we present our analytical results , providing the pdf , cdf and ber for both mmse and zf sinrs . in section",

    "we find that low angle - spreads lead to deterioration of the ber when the signal path has the same direction of arrival as the interfering paths .",
    "in addition , we find that lower angle - spreads increase the ber away from the interferers direction .",
    "this last observation is due to the fact that higher angle - spread leads to higher diversity and hence reduced outage probability .",

    "it should be noted that if we wanted to be strict regarding the leading corrections being @xmath215 , in the above expression the arguments of @xmath114 , @xmath58 and @xmath235 should be set to @xmath69 , rather than @xmath236 .",
