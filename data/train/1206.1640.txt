    "the importance of the josephson@xcite effect , the superconducting tunnelling of electron cooper pairs across a thin barrier ( oxide layer ) separating two superconductors , and leading to a dc current @xmath55 ( ac current @xmath56 if biased ) , is that it provided for the first time an instrument , a clamp , which can pin down the ( difference in ) gauge phase existing between two superconducting systems .",

    "pairing vibrations , i.e. quantal fluctuations in particle number are quite collective .",
    "this is consistent with the fact of the stronger role fluctuations play , as a rule , in fmbs as compared with ( infinite ) condensed systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . in keeping with the above narrative , the extension of the studies of tunnelling process of deformed systems in gauge space , to systems displaying _ dynamical _ gauge lro had to await for the measurement and calculation of two  nucleon transfer reaction cross sections in atomic nuclei ( see the chapter contributed by hansen to this volume ) . within this context ,",
    "i.e. collective vibrations associated with single cooper pairs , it is of notice that one has found a new mechanism to correlate cooper pairs , and eventually break gauge symmetry , which has emerged from studies of pairing correlations in exotic halo nuclei ( cf .",
    "sects . 6 and 7 below ) .",
    "let us come back for a moment to the question of the tunnelling between superconductors .",
    "bardeen argued that virtual pair excitations in the superconducting ground state do not extend across the oxide layer@xcite .",
    "thus , even if single electrons can tunnel through it , the tail of the pair wavefunction is virtually identical with that of the normal state .",
    "now , the crucial point in cooper tunnelling , however , is that vanishing of the gap @xmath75 does not imply the vanishing of @xmath76 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath76 can have large amplitude for fermions separated by distances @xmath77 up to the coherence length @xmath78 ( see e.g.@xcite ) .    within this context one can mention the case of quadrupole pairing and of gapless superconductivity in , quadrupole deformed , actinide nuclei@xcite . in these nuclei , one observes a dynamic decoupling between the condensate and particular nilsson orbitals lying close to the fermi energy and displaying a value of the intrinsic quadrupole moment of sign opposite from that of the majority of the single  particle levels lying around the fermi energy . in keeping with the fact that quadrupole deformed nuclei break rotational invariance , the `` effective '' pairing coupling constant , is the sum of the monopole and of the quadrupole pairing .",
    "thus the interaction correlating cooper pairs moving in oblate @xmath79prolate @xmath80 nilsson orbits      is much smaller than that which pairs particles moving in nilsson states displaying the same sign of the intrinsic quadrupole moment . in other words",
    "@xmath82 consequently , pairs of nucleons moving in ( @xmath83)orbitals feel an essentially zero pairing gap .",
    "they thus lead to pairing vibrations displaying cross sections relative to the ground state which are much larger than the expected value @xmath84 of typical superfluid nuclei ( see ( [ eq12 ] ) ) .",
    "let us now concentrate on the value of the amplitude for two fermions , at @xmath85 and @xmath86 to belong to a cooper pair namely @xmath87 , that is , the nuclear structure component of the two  particle transfer cross section amplitudes ( cooper pair wavefunction ) .",
    "to clarify the physics which is at the basis of the renormalizability of the bcs description of the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking of superfluid nuclei , in terms of a coupling constant @xmath88 and of an energy cutoff , we discuss two scenarios for the case of the @xmath60sn@xmath89sn reaction . in the first one , we consider",
    "all bound single ",
    "particle states , the cutoff energy being @xmath90 mev . in the second case one",
    "sets @xmath91 mev , discretizing the continuum inside a spherical box of 8 fm of radius . the bcs gap ( @xmath92 mev ; experimental value ) and number ( @xmath93 ) equations lead to @xmath94 mev and @xmath95 mev in the first case and @xmath96 mev and @xmath97 mev in the second one",
    ". the associated cooper pair probability distributions in r - space are essentially identical .",
    "it is then not surprising that they lead to very similar absolute values of the two  particle transfer cross section associated with the reaction @xmath60sn@xmath89sn(gs ) .",
    "let us now repeat the argument , but this time in terms of @xmath98 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) ) .",
    "because the pairing gap has been fixed to reproduce the experimental value ( 1.41 mev ) , one obtains in the case of @xmath90mev @xmath99 and @xmath100 in the case of @xmath91mev .",
    "this result emphasizes the problem of working with an expression which contains explicitly the pairing coupling constant as ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "one could argue that such an objection could also be leveled against the relation @xmath101 .",
    "note however , that a @xmath61 reactions would hardly feel the effect of contributions far removed from the fermi surface @xmath102 .",
    "this is in keeping with the fact that transfer to levels lying far away from @xmath102 will be unfavourable due to @xmath103value effects . if one argues in terms of the relative distance @xmath104 between target and projectile ( @xmath105 for continuum  like contributions ; @xmath106 for deeply bound  like contributions ) , the outcome is similar .",
    "in fact , for large distances the two  particle transfer formfactor vanishes while , at small distances the outgoing tritium will experience strong absorption .",
    "in fact , considering only the contribution to @xmath107 arising from the valence orbitals , that is , essentially those contributing to the `` naked '' vision of the cooper pair wavefunctions , one obtains @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively , and thus , a negligible squared relative difference between the two predicted cross sections , namely @xmath110 .",
    "one can posit that while there exist accurate relations to implement renormalization protocols , arguably , they can hardly take the place of physical intuition in renormalizing asymptotically free theories , like for example nuclear bcs ( choice of adequate values of @xmath88 and of @xmath111 ) .",
    "second , that the resulting ( gauge invariant ) coherent states ( pairing rotational band ) are extremely simple macroscopic  like quantal objects ( almost classical states ) , whose wavefunctions can be calculated quite accurately and almost effortlessly , making use of schematic hamiltonians ( like e.g. the mean field bcs hamiltonian ) . within this context , the corresponding two ",
    "nucleon transfer spectroscopic amplitudes can be considered essentially accurate .",
    "consequently , they can be used , together with the experimentally determined optical potentials , to quantitatively test the validity of two  nucleon transfer reaction theories in predicting absolute differential cross sections .",
    "this is also true concerning qrpa states associated with the dynamical violation of gauge invariance ( pairing vibrations@xcite ) .",

    "the analysis of such reactions can , as a rule , only be made in terms of a coupled  channel treatment .",
    "even if coulomb excitation is weak it is not obvious that lowest order perturbation theory is adequate . for bombarding energies above the coulomb barrier there",
    "will necessarily occur collisions with impact parameters which lead to strong interactions where the transfer process can no longer be treated to lowest order .",

    "the associated amplitudes are , in the semiclassical approximation ( prior  prior representation ) @xmath124 @xmath125 and @xmath126 the first term @xmath127 , describes the simultaneous transfer of two nucleons .",
    "the two  step successive transfer is described by @xmath128 , while @xmath129 is a second  order contribution arising from the non  orthogonality of the channels considered .    in the independent particle limit",
    "this term cancels exactly the simultaneous transfer contribution @xmath127 .",
    "the transfer reaction is then described as a purely successive process by the amplitude @xmath128 , as was expected . under normal , physical circumstances ,",
    "much of this cancellation will still be operative , in keeping with the fact that the correlation energy binding cooper pairs is weak ( @xmath130 mev ) as confronted with the fermi energy @xmath131mev ) .",
    "another wording of the same concept is based on the fact that pairing can be viewed as a small correction to the independent particle motion @xmath132 mev/25 mev @xmath133 being the single  particle potential , while @xmath88 is the pairing coupling constant , @xmath134mev @xmath135 ) . further circumstantial evidence to this cancellation is provided by the fact that extending the summation appearing in @xmath129 to all states of the two nuclei @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( including continuum states ) , one can then perform closure in which case @xmath129 exactly cancels out @xmath127 .",
    "the other limiting situation which can be analyzed in simple terms , namely that in which the two transferred particles are strongly correlated , can be better understood rewriting the above amplitudes in the so  called mixed , post  prior representation , just an embodiment of energy conservation ( i.e , @xmath138 . in this representation ,",
    "the non  orthogonality term is zero ( and of course the new expression of @xmath139 smaller than the previous one ) .    in the case",
    "in which @xmath140 , a very large energy will be associated with the breaking of a pair in the intermediate @xmath141 channel ( i.e. @xmath142 ) , the corresponding exponentials leading to rapid oscillations and thus to a cancellation of the two orbital integrals appearing in @xmath128 . in this case",
    ", the transfer of two particles thus takes mainly place as a simultaneous transfer . in nuclei ,",
    "the first scenario ( independent particle scenario ) , is closer to the actual experimental situation than this last one .        used in connection with the josephson effect ( cf .",

    "the @xmath150 , bcs coherence factor associated with two  nucleon transfers reactions arises here in connection with the fact that @xmath151 within this context , bardeen@xcite was right concerning the fact that the process described by the amplitude @xmath127 could hardly give rise to observable effects . on the other hand , because the coherence length of cooper pairs in metals is larger than the oxide layer thickness , the order parameter @xmath152 can be built up , without loss of coherence , one step at a time , with the help of the above expression , namely transference of one fermion at a time .",
    "a dynamical embodiment of this mechanism is , arguably , at the basis of the bootstrap binding of the halo cooper pair to the core of @xmath153li , leading to the weakly bound @xmath0li nucleus ( see below ) .",
    "because of spatial quantization , it may be possible , through strongly negative @xmath103value effects , to make very unfavourable one  particle transfer , and thus the successive transfer of two nucleons , like e.g. in the isotopes of sn with mass number @xmath154 , and of be ( @xmath155 ) . by properly adjusting the bombarding energy",
    ", one would provide optimal conditions for simultaneous transfer . whether the associated weak absolute cross section can be recorded at profit ,",
    "is an open question .",
    "let us remind that the overcompleteness and thus non  orthogonality displayed by the elementary modes of excitation basis employed in nft to describe nuclear structure leads to a coupling hamiltonian to be diagonalized , as a rule , perturbatively , in keeping with the fact that most of the nuclear correlations are already included in the basis states ( i.e. single  particle and collective motion ) . similarly , the tunnelling hamiltonian ( [ eq17 ] ) can be derived by finding sets of single  particle functions for each side of the oxide junction ( left and right superconductors ) in the absence of the potential of the other metal .",
    "then , one eliminates nonorthogonality effects by perturbation theory@xcite .    while many analogies can be established between condensed matter bcs related phenomenon and fmbs nuclear ones ,",
