    "we have used a total of 3912  configurations in the energy range @xmath67 with known committor values , corresponding to the left and right borders of the blue rectangles in fig.[fig : string_image ] , for the construction of the string reaction coordinate .",
    "the string with @xmath68 corresponds to the linear model reaction coordinate as introduced by peters and trout  @xcite , so as a first test , we have checked that the results obtained for the @xmath68 string are in agreement with the results of our implementation of the linear optimization procedure .",
    "apart from some discretization error due to the way the committor data are handled in our string coordinate code , these two likelihood scores agree well .",
    "the score for the linear version also serves as a baseline to compare the likelihood score for more complex strings .",
    "in particular , for any combination of variables , the likelihood score obtained by a string with @xmath69 should be greater than the corresponding likelihood for the optimized linear reaction coordinate .",
    "it is worth noting that the main computational effort in the construction of the reaction coordinate goes into the calculation of committor values and has to be performed on a cluster with many computing cores .",
    "in contrast , the string optimization procedure , even for many combinations of variables , can be done at comparatively low computational cost on a single workstation .    .optimum",
    "bic scores and the corresponding likelihoods , as well as the string length @xmath25 at which the optimum was achieved , for all the investigated collective variables .",
    "note that smaller bic values are better .",

    "note that the minimal bic is always reached at values of @xmath70 .",
    "in other words , in any case , the performance of the optimum string coordinate is better than the corresponding linear reaction coordinate , even after correcting for the higher model complexity introduced by the additional degrees of freedom in the form of the coordinates of the string images as well as the parameters of @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , as it is the case with the linear version of the reaction coordinate , the combination with the global order parameter @xmath0 gets the highest score . even with the added flexibility of the string , no combination of the energy with any other variable than @xmath0 performs better than ( @xmath64 , @xmath0 ) even in the linear case .",
    "however , the combinations ( @xmath64 ,  @xmath53 ) and ( @xmath64 , @xmath54 ) come very close , indicating that the flexibility of the string can compensate for the lower quality of the order parameter combinations up to a certain point .",
    "similarly , the likelihood score for the combination with the squared radius of gyration @xmath57 is comparatively low even for the best string coordinate .    as an illustration ,",
    "we have plotted four optimized strings in the @xmath64-@xmath0 plane in fig.[fig : string_image ] . shown in the same figure are four optimized strings in the @xmath64-@xmath53 plane , the variable combination that gave the second - best likelihood .",
    "note that for larger values of @xmath25 the strings are distinctly curved , deviating strongly from the linear reaction coordinate studied earlier . also shown as colormap in the same figure is a comparison of the predicted committor values of the used configurations with the actual one .",
    "the mappings @xmath71 corresponding to the @xmath64-@xmath0 strings are shown in fig.[fig : ralpha ] .     for five independent runs of the optimization procedure , with the potential energy @xmath64 and @xmath0 as variables .",
    "the minimal bic is reached for @xmath41 . the likelihood score for the linear model reaction coordinate",
    "is also shown for comparison . ]    the likelihood score , as well as the bayesian information criterion , as a function of @xmath25 for a number of independent optimization runs  each with @xmath0 as second variable  is shown in fig.[fig : likelihood_m ] .",
    "the @xmath68 scores correspond to the linear reaction coordinate .",
    "one can observe that the score reaches a plateau for @xmath41 , in other words , it is sufficient to use a string with that length .",
    "any further addition of string points only increases the model complexity without improving its accuracy , a fact which is also conveyed by the bayesian information criterion . in fig.[fig : pb_of_r ] , we have plotted this optimum reaction coordinate given by the m=5 string  as obtained by one of the optimizations runs  against the real committor value . for a perfect fit",
    ", the real committor values would coincide with the hyperbolic tangent function shown in red in the same figure .",
    "string in the @xmath64-@xmath0 plane . shown in red",
    "is the ideal model committor of eq .. ]",
    "for sufficiently narrow attractive wells , the polymer chain investigated in this paper shows a two - state folding transition from the expanded coil to the crystalline state . in the present work , using likelihood maximization , we have constructed a string reaction coordinate for this process .",
    "as already observed in our previous study using a purely linear reaction coordinate , the combination of the potential energy with the global order parameter @xmath0 gave the best likelihood score . due to the form of the pair potential ,",
    "the potential energy of the system is basically a measure for the number of contacts between non - neighboring monomers .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 , which is sensitive to closed - packed structures , adds information about the crystallinity of a given configuration .",
    "therefore , it is sensible that a combination of these two parameters will work rather well as a reaction coordinate , since during a typical folding transition , both the number of contacts as well as the crystalline order will increase . due to the curved nature of the string ,",
    "our string reaction coordinate is able to follow this transition more closely than a purely linear reaction coordinate .",
    "this is what leads to the observed improvement in the likelihood score . in particular , upon following the string along the crystallization , one observes a change of behavior from the initial to the final stages of the transition .",
    "initially , the system changes mainly by increasing its overall crystallinity as quantified by the @xmath0 parameter . presumably , this is due to the formation of a small crystalline core in the system .",
    "later on in the crystallization , the strongest change is seen in the potential energy , caused by a steady growth of the initial crystalline core leading to more and more particles packed closely together .    however , the total improvement of the quality of the found reaction coordinate is rather modest .",
    "it remains therefore a challenging task to identify better order parameters as candidates in the construction of reaction coordinates .",
    "more specifically , these order parameters , while still being as symmetric as possible , should also take into account the order of particles along the polymer chain , which has been completely neglected so far . in the case of more complex polymers ,",
    "for example if there is less energetic difference between unfolded and crystalline state , it might also help to work with the connectivity information in a more detailed way , rather than with the number of all connections alone .",
