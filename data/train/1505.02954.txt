    "the ability of addressing , initializing , and possibly controlling one single qubit without spoiling its quantum features or disturbing other nearby qubits is a necessary prerequisite for putting a quantum device into operation .",
    "depending on the specific device architecture , however , this can be a most challenging task , as it implies the opening of the qubit towards an environment that , in a way or another , embodies some macroscopic apparatus .",
    "one possibility for avoiding that this opening alter the fragile properties of the qubit is that of placing the apparatus at a distance , and use a transmission line for conveying a proper signal to the qubit itself . in particular , when the qubit is represented by a localized magnetic particle  @xcite it comes quite natural that the above signal be a time - dependent magnetic field , which nonetheless leaves the question open on how to realize the transmission line . to this purpose ,",
    "we here propose the use of classical spin chains featuring soliton - like excitations , a choice suggested by these observations : _ i _ ) a soliton faithfully represents a signal in so far as it is a finite - energy excitation which is well localized in space at any given time , and can travel at fixed velocity with constant profile ; _ ii _ ) solitons are known to travel undisturbed along their medium , which allows us to put the apparatus that generates the pulse at great distance from the qubit and yet be sure that the signal will pass near its target undeformed ; _ iii _ ) solitons relative to the very same model can have different shapes and energies , which gives us the freedom of choosing the signal that best controls the qubit , without modifying the transmission line .    as for this latter component , we know that some classical fields defined on a one - dimensional space display solitonic excitations , whose renowned stability stems from the competition between linear and non - linear terms in the field s equations of motion ( eom ) . based on the well established connection between classical vector - field theories and models of interacting spin-@xmath1 particles on discrete one - dimensional lattices  @xcite",
    ", one can expect soliton - like excitations to typify some spin chains  @xcite , which directly suggests that one such chain can serve for supporting a solitonic signal .",
    "moreover , as extensively shown in the literature  @xcite a renormalized classical approach  @xcite is often appropriate for describing the actual behaviour of real compounds with @xmath2  @xcite , which allows us to treat the signal s generation and propagation at a classical level .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s.solitons-as-signals ] we introduce and characterize the soliton of which we will make use as non - linear excitation of a classical vector field . based on the fact that such field is the continuum limit of a spin model on a one - dimensional lattice , namely the heisenberg spin chain , in sec .",
    "[ s.htransm ] we numerically check that dynamical configurations corresponding to discrete versions of the above solitons can be solutions of the chain s eom ; in the same section we propose a method for injecting solitons by applying a time - dependent magnetic field to one end of the chain . in sec .",

    "in fact , by numerically solving eqs .  , we have checked that the heisenberg spin chain properly supports @xmath15-solitons whenever the zeeman energy @xmath36 is much smaller than the bond energy @xmath37 , as implied by @xmath33 via eqs .   and .",
    "this result fits with the experimental observation , in quasi one - dimensional systems , of magnetic behaviours whose origin can be unequivocally ascribed to the presence of soliton - like excitations  @xcite . in what follows , we will therefore take that the time - dependent chain configuration @xmath38 is a solution of the discrete eom , embodying the signal we want to convey to the qubit , with the respective heisenberg chain serving as transmission line .",

    "therefore , enforcing @xmath46 as a boundary condition should result in the selection of the configuration corresponding to @xmath47 , amongst all those that solve eqs .  .",
    "on the other hand it can be easily seen that eqs .   with condition enforced",
    "are the eom of a heisenberg chain with @xmath48 , and an auxiliary magnetic field @xmath49 acting just on @xmath50 .",
    "this suggests that , by applying the magnetic field   to one end of the transmission line , it should be possible to generate a soliton - like signal , that will then travel through to its target .",
    "the consistency of the above description has been checked , for different values of @xmath15 , as follows .",
    "first , we have numerically solved eqs .   with the time - dependent constraint eq .  , and @xmath51 , by means of a second - order symplectic algorithm  @xcite .",

    "the resulting configurations have the thermal correlators @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "we have then analyzed the resulting solutions and found that when the field @xmath59 is applied to @xmath60 , i.e. , after the injection of @xmath47 , dynamical configurations @xmath61 , identifiable as soliton - like , actually appear into the chain . in order to better characterize these configurations ,",
    "we have numerically measured their velocity @xmath62 and , assuming the validity of eq .  , we have obtained values for the respective amplitudes , @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "these values have been found to agree with those independently determined by fitting @xmath64 with eqs .",

    "summarizing , the above analysis confirms that :    * by applying the field @xmath59 defined in eq .   to the left tail of the chain , * a dynamical configuration @xmath61",

    "in fact , the detailed dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath83 is not relevant , particularly if , as in the present scheme , the time dependence of the magnetic moments is primarily due to the transit of a signal whose length is of a finite number of lattice spacings .",

    "we will further comment upon this assumption in sec.[s.conclusions ] .",
    "suppose now that a magnetic signal in the form of @xmath101 run through the chain ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "in the early stage of the process , at a time when the soliton is still far from the site @xmath103 , it is @xmath104 and the qubit bloch vector undergoes a uniform precession around @xmath105 , unless it is not initially aligned along the @xmath106-axis itself . in order to isolate the qubit evolution exclusively due to the soliton transit ,",
    "it is therefore convenient to choose @xmath107 , with @xmath108 the earlier time when @xmath109 .",

    "[ f.az_contour ] , however , is the presence of a region where almost complete flipping occurs : this means that fine - tuning is not necessary and if @xmath124 is difficult to alter one can still act on @xmath125 , or viceversa , depending on the specific physical realization of the scheme .    when a finite interaction range ( @xmath126 ) is considered , as in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ f.lapseopt ] , the qubit s dynamics is qualitatively similar to that observed for @xmath117  @xcite , but the value of @xmath120 is found quite sensitive to @xmath87 itself . however , an almost complete flipping , even better than that observed in fig .",
    "[ f.lapseopt ] , can be obtained by further adjusting the available parameters .",

    "first of all we have numerically demonstrated that systems of interacting magnetic moments on one - dimensional lattices , possibly of finite length , support dynamical configurations which are the discrete counterparts of @xmath15-solitons if @xmath155 , i.e. , @xmath156 , to be confronted with @xmath157 for getting @xmath16",
    ". given the values of @xmath1 and @xmath158 tipically observed in magnetic compounds , it is @xmath159k meaning that , as @xmath160  k / tesla , only very large fields could break the above inequality , and the continuum approximation is therefore most often justified .",
    "further notice that our scheme might also be considered in the case of dynamical solitons that do not require @xmath157 for being supported by the heisenberg chain  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we know that solitons exist and run also in anisotropic spin chains  @xcite , which makes our scheme potentially efficient in the case of anisotropic quasi one - dimensional real compounds . in fact , this is quite a relevant feature when thinking of implementations based on one - dimensional monatomic metal chains deposited on surfaces  @xcite where the system s geometry inevitably makes the intra - chain exchange anisotropic  @xcite .    as for the issue of how dynamical solitons can be generated",
    ", we have preliminary indications that our proposal keeps being effective when the action of the field pulse @xmath59 is not punctual , as understood by eq .  , but rather extends to a finite part of the chain end ( shorter than the induced soliton ) , as required in a realistic setup ; hence , the effect of @xmath59 is amplified by the effective number of spins it affects and its intensity can well be comparable with @xmath161 .",
    "having shown that a controlled action on the qubit can actually be obtained by its interaction with the nearby running magnetic soliton , we notice that the condition required by the continuum approximation is fully consistent with the small values of @xmath162 that are found to produce a permanent variation of the qubit state , according to the analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ s.qubit-dynamics ] .",
    "moreover , the energy exchanged between qubit and chain in the case of complete flipping ( obtained by , say , @xmath163 , @xmath117 , @xmath146 , @xmath164 ) amounts to @xmath165 ; as the soliton energy is of the order of @xmath37 , the chain dynamics results unaffected by the evolution of the qubit , essentially validating the ` no back - action ' approximation mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s.qubit-dynamics ] . as for the limits dictated by the typical coherence times attainable in solid state qubits realizations ,",
    "an additional relevant quantity is the time @xmath166 required by the soliton to reach the qubit after its injection : for a time scale of @xmath167s , we can estimate @xmath168ns , if the qubit lies around @xmath169 lattice constants away from the chain end .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that the magnetic solitons propagation we have studied is an energy - conservative phenomenon and has proved to be robust against thermal noise up to a reduced temperature @xmath170 : this suggests that , besides the specific proposal presented in this work , using solitons for transferring either classical or quantum information in solid - state devices might strongly alleviate the heat dissipation requirements that seriously affect more conventional solutions , without requiring a highly demanding lowering of the operating temperature .",
