    "a few comments are in order :    * the right hand side of  ( [ ginversion ] ) is zero , but in the more general situation some of the partial generating functions , @xmath41 will fail to be self - reciprocal for certain choices of @xmath30 .",

    "the function @xmath5 occurring in  ( [ invrel ] ) may in principle be more complicated than @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "in this case , the partial generating functions might not be self - reciprocal .",
    "an example is provided in section  [ sect : statmech ] by the potts model , but in the polyomino examples considered in this paper , this situation does not arise .",
    "we now present a nonexhaustive list of recipes for finding and proving reciprocity results and inversion relations .    1 .",
    "if the generating function ( or thermodynamic quantity ) is known in closed form , an inversion relation can be demonstrated directly . as an example",

    "in non - integrable models , the transfer matrix will still be invertible and may suggest a possible inversion relation , but the required analyticity property is lacking .",

    "the technical heart of the paper consists of section  [ sect : temperley ] on the temperley methodology , and section  [ sect : stanley ] on the application of stanley s results to polyominoes .",
    "the first use of the inversion relation in statistical mechanics was the solution by stroganov of certain two dimensional vertex models on the square lattice  @xcite .",
    "generalizations of stroganov s models were later solved by the same means by schultz  @xcite .",
    "shortly after stroganov , baxter used a similar method to solve the hard hexagon model  @xcite and recognized its broad applicability , giving the eight - vertex and ising models as examples  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a number of authors pointed out that many known solutions to problems in two - dimensional statistical mechanics can be derived easily using the inversion relation method . among these were shankar  @xcite , baxter  @xcite and pokrovsky and bashilov  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that inversion relations hold also for models that have not been solved .",
    "prominent among such models are the two - dimensional ising model in a magnetic field whose inversion relation was found by baxter  @xcite , and the three - dimensional ising model and noncritical @xmath48-state potts model , both of whose inversion relations were found by jaekel and maillard  @xcite .",
    "what generally distinguishes solved and unsolved models is the growth rate in the number of poles arising in the partial generating functions in the expansion  ( [ pargenfun ] ) , as a function of order . roughly speaking",
    ", a more complicated pole structure implies that the number of parameters needed to specify a given partial generating function is greater , and makes it less likely that an inversion relation can completely determine all of them .",
    "nevertheless , inversion relations are still invaluable in the study of such problems , not least because they provide an independent check on series data .",
    "the fundamental problem of statistical mechanics is to calculate the partition function .",
    "here we consider vertex models defined on a square lattice with each bond colored with one of @xmath49 possible colors .",
    "each lattice site makes a contribution to the energy of the system which depends on the colors of the adjacent bonds .",
    "this defines an @xmath50-vertex model if all possible colorings are permitted .",
    "stroganov computed the partition function per site in the thermodynamic limit of several 16- and 81-vertex models .",
    "consider first a finite lattice ( on the torus ) of @xmath51 rows and @xmath52 columns .",
    "the partition function can be expressed in terms of the transfer matrix @xmath53 as : @xmath54 \\label{pf}\\ ] ] ( see @xcite ) . here , @xmath53 is the @xmath55 matrix whose @xmath56th entry is the contribution to @xmath57 of a single row of @xmath52 sites connected to the row below by a set of vertical bonds in configuration @xmath58 and to the row above by a set of vertical bonds in configuration @xmath28 .",

    "for simplicity let us consider a family of models whose vertex energies are functions of a single parameter , @xmath62 .",
    "the models solved by stroganov are integrable by virtue of the commutativity of the transfer matrices at different values of this parameter .",
    "this implies that the transfer matrix eigenvectors are common to all members of the family , and that the @xmath62 dependence is only in the eigenvalues .",
    "for this reason @xmath62 is often called the _",
    "spectral parameter_. the key observation is that the inverse of the transfer matrix in these models is itself a member of the commuting family , up to a scale factor @xmath63 ^{-1 } = \\psi(b)^{-m } \\ { \\sst_m}\\left(\\phi(b)\\right ) .",

    "presumably it is a consequence of the condition of commuting transfer matrices .",
    "here we take it as a hypothesis .",
    "then baxter has shown that the inversion relation  ( [ isinginv ] ) , symmetry  ( [ isingsym ] ) and the denominator form  ( [ isingform ] ) determine @xmath77 completely .",
    "we present his argument in section  [ subsect : computegf ] where we use it in the context of polygon enumeration .",
    "up till now we have been assuming integrability and in particular we have relied on the property that the transfer matrix and its inverse are both members of some one - parameter commuting family .",
    "what about models for which this property does nt hold ?",
    "since analyticity of @xmath69 breaks down , the step  ( [ func ] ) in the above derivation is no longer valid .",

    "the inversion relations we will be considering in the remainder of the paper are derived by analysis of the generating function ( analogous to the low temperature expansion ) and do not depend on the models being integrable .",

    "likewise , the inversion relations for three - choice polygons and staircase polygons with a staircase hole , given in table  [ table : summary ] , are also special cases of more general formulae which will be derived in section  [ sect : stanley ] .      as in statistical mechanics ,",
    "the inversion relation and symmetry , and some general assumptions on analyticity of the generating function , are sometimes sufficient to determine the solution completely . in order to have an algorithm for computing a generating function term by term , it is necessary , but not sufficient , to have some property relating terms of different orders . for our purposes",
