    "quantum magnetism has received considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental points of view in the past decades .",
    "some low - dimensional magnets , for example , antiferromagnetic spin chains with half odd integer spins are gapless and have a disordered ground state ; while some others , such as antiferromagnetic spin chains with integer spins , spin ladders and dimerized spin chains , are gapped and disordered . in two dimensional cases , heisenberg antiferromagnets in the square lattice are gapless and have ordered ground states at zero temperature . besides the dimensional effect , various frustration and anisotropy cause novel and complex phenomena .",
    "recently , bicomponent systems combining two different spin frameworks have been realized experimentally in r@xmath7banio@xmath8@xcite , cu@xmath7fe@xmath7ge@xmath9o@xmath6@xcite , cu@xmath7cdb@xmath7o@xmath10@xcite and cu@xmath11mo@xmath7o@xmath12@xcite . among them , cu@xmath4fe@xmath4ge@xmath5o@xmath6 , which incorporates intercalated cu@xmath13 spin dimers ( @xmath14 ) and fe@xmath15 spin chains ( @xmath16 ) , is most extensively studied .",
    "below @xmath17 k , a cooperative order was observed by the measurements of susceptibility and heat capacity@xcite . at @xmath18",
    "k , the estimated @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath20 . compared to the classical expectation value of @xmath22 @xmath20 , @xmath23 is drastically suppressed and keeps proportional to @xmath24 at all temperatures . by detailed inelastic neutron scattering study@xcite",
    ", cu@xmath4fe@xmath4ge@xmath5o@xmath6 was found to exhibit two types of spin excitations with separate energy scales .",
    "although the fe@xmath15-centered low - energy spin excitations can be well interpreted by the spin wave theory and a small gap of about @xmath22 mev is estimated , the cu@xmath13-centered high - energy part is less understood .",
    "masuda et .",
    "al@xcite guessed the presence of a triplet mode , which should have longitudinal polarization and be totally incompatible with conventional spin wave theory . in this paper , we combine bond operator representation@xcite and holstein - primakoff transformation@xcite to study this bicomponent system .",
    "since the exchange coupling along the c - axis is pretty weak , the real geometry of cu@xmath4fe@xmath4ge@xmath5o@xmath6 could be simplified as a two - dimensional topologically equivalent model@xcite ( fig.[str2 ] ) .",
    "the model hamiltonian consists of the cu - cu , the fe - fe and the cu - fe interactions : @xmath25 with @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath2 denote the cu - cu and cu - fe interactions respectively , and @xmath28 the fe - fe exchange constant along a(b ) direction . by neutron inelastic scattering and neutron diffraction@xcite ,",

    "single - ion anisotropy and external magnetic field are not considered here . with a vanishing @xmath2 ,",
    "the model reduces to the independent one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains with @xmath1 and isolated spin dimers with @xmath31 . with a finite @xmath2",
    ", an effective interaction between the fe@xmath15 chains , mediated by the cu@xmath13 dimers , will make the fe@xmath15 spins stay in the nel state .",
    "( the small fe - fe interactions along c - direction reinforce this order ) .",
    "on the other hand , the local magnetization of fe@xmath15 spins will tend to excite the cu@xmath13 dimers from the singlet to the triplet and the cu@xmath13 spins will then show local magnetizations . in the following , we study the effective interaction between the fe@xmath15 chains mediated by the cu@xmath13 dimers perturbatively and the cu@xmath13 magnetization induced by the local fe@xmath15 spins(section ii ) . in section iii ,",
    "we study the excitation spectra of the mixed spin system .",
    "a summary is given in section iv .",
    "as mentioned before , @xmath27 is much larger than @xmath28 and @xmath2 . considering the low energy excitations only and integrating out the degrees of freedom of the spin dimers ,",
    "we could obtain an effective fe - fe exchange @xmath32 mediated by isolated spin-@xmath33 dimers@xcite . in the model hamiltonian(eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , @xmath34 could be treated as a small amount and @xmath35 will be neglected for the moment since no cu@xmath13 spin operators are involved in it . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the model then reduces to a four - spin system @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "+    @xmath39 has a singlet ground state @xmath40 with a ground state energy @xmath41 .",

    "thus , up to the third order , the effective exchange coupling mediated by the spin-@xmath50 dimer is obtained as @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "with the effective interaction between the fe@xmath15 spin chains considered , the fe@xmath15 spins will order antiferromagnetically .",
    "we use a molecular field approximation to study the effects of the staggered fe@xmath15 magnetization on the cu@xmath13 spin dimers .",
    "it is relevant at a higher energy range ( comparable to the dimer gap ) , where the dynamics of the system is dominated by the dimers and the chain freedom can be effectively integrated out .",

    "in the fe - cu spin system , if we neglect the interaction between the cu@xmath13 and fe@xmath15 spins , the fe@xmath15 spins will be in the nel state ( considering the antiferromagnetic interaction along c - direction ) and its excitations are spin - waves ( magnons ) ; while the cu@xmath13 dimers are in the singlet states and the excitations are triplets ( triplons ) .",
    "when the cu - fe interactions are switched on , the nel order in the fe@xmath15 spin network is reinforced and a staggered magnetization in the cu@xmath13 spins are induced .",
