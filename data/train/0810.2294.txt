    "* ) , but also in more loose aggregates , spread in large numbers over wide areas spanning tens or even hundreds of square degrees on the sky @xcite .",
    "ongoing surveys suggest that this `` distributed '' or non - clustered population , could be as numerous as that in clusters @xcite .",
    "while the earliest stages of stellar evolution must be probed with infrared and radio techniques that can peer into the embedded , very young ( ages @xmath2 myr ) on - cloud populations , many fundamental questions including lifetimes of molecular clouds , cluster dispersal , protoplanetary disk evolution and triggered star formation , can only be addressed by surveys of the older , off - cloud populations with ages @xmath3 myr .",
    "modern studies of star formation in nearby stellar nurseries are incomplete if they do not include this widely spread population .",
    "the orion ob1 association @xcite , located well below the galactic plane ( @xmath4 ) , at a distance of roughly 400 pc @xcite , and spanning over @xmath0 on the sky , is one of the two largest and nearest ob associations ( the other one being scorpius - centaurus , see the chapter by preibisch & mamajek ) .",
    "@xcite quotes 56 massive stars with spectral types earlier than b2 , more than scorpius - centaurus and lacerta ob1 , and only slightly less than cepheus .",
    "he estimates a total mass for orion ob1 of @xmath5 , though this number is probably best interpreted as a lower limit , because it does not include the lower mass stars . with a wide range of ages and environmental conditions",
    ", orion exhibits all stages of the star formation process , from very young , embedded clusters , to older , fully exposed ob associations , as well as both clustered and distributed populations .",
    "therefore , this region is an ideal laboratory for investigating fundamental questions related to the birth of stars and planetary systems .",
    "here we focus on the low - mass ( @xmath1 ) , pre - main sequence population widely distributed in the orion ob1 association , in the general area within @xmath6h to 6h and @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite divided group 1b into three subgroups , mainly motivated by @xcite and @xcite who , based on ubv photometric parallaxes , found a gradient of distances for the three belt stars , with @xmath18 ori being the nearest and @xmath20 ori the farthest .",

    "if the subgroups are unbound and expanding , this suggests a sequence of decreasing ages .",
    "in fact , from the color - magnitude diagrams for the hottest stars in each subassociation , blaauw provides ages of 12 myr for 1a , 8 myr for 1b , 6 myr for 1c and @xmath24 myr to 1d ( though the kinematic age for the onc is listed in his table ii as 0.3 myr ) .",

    "despite being one of the best studied star - forming regions in the solar vicinity , comprehensive studies of the widely spread , low - mass , pre - main sequence ( pms ) population across orion ob1 started to become available only quite recently .",
    "the reason has been that , unlike what happens with the very young on - cloud populations , it is much more difficult to find these older , more distributed low - mass stars , because the parent molecular clouds dissipate after a few myr and no longer serve as markers of these populations ( see also the discussion in sect . 1 of the chapter by preibisch and mamajek ) .",

    "before considering the various search techniques used to find low - mass pms stars in the wide off - cloud areas in ob associations like orion ob1 , it is useful to briefly review the observational properties of these young low - mass objects .",
    "low - mass pms stars , known collectively as t tauri stars ( tts ) , were originally characterized by their late spectral types ( g - m ) , strong emission lines ( especially h@xmath38 ) , and significant variability in brightness at most wavelengths ; many are also found spatially associated with regions of dark nebulosity @xcite . stars resembling the original variables first identified as tts",
    "are currently called `` strong emission '' or classical tts ( ctts ) .",
    "subsequent spectroscopic studies of the ca ii h and k lines and the first x - ray observations with the _ einstein _ x - ray observatory @xcite revealed surprisingly strong x - ray activity in tts , exceeding the solar levels by several orders of magnitude , and also revealed a population of x - ray strong objects lacking the optical signposts of ctts , like strong h@xmath38 emission .",
    "these stars , initially called `` naked - t tauri stars '' @xcite , are now widely known as `` weak - line '' tts ( wtts ) after @xcite . at first , the ctts / wtts dividing line was set at w(h@xmath38 ) @xmath39   .",
    "recently , @xcite revisited the wtts / ctts classification and suggested a modified criterion that takes into account the contrast effect in h@xmath38 emission as a function of spectral type in stars cooler than late k.      the strong h@xmath38 emission characteristic of ctts made large area searches using photographic plates and objective prisms on wide field instruments like schmidt telescopes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * in orion ) particularly appealing .",
    "these very low resolution spectroscopic surveys ( typical dispersions of @xmath40   / mm at h@xmath38 ) provided large area coverage , allowed estimates of spectral types and a qualitative assessment of the strength of prominent emission lines .",
    "in the orion ob1 association , the most systematic search was that done with the 1 m kiso schmidt @xcite covering roughly 150 square degrees and detecting @xmath41 emission line stars , many of which were argued to be likely tts ( figure [ spatial_rass_kiso ] ) .",
    "@xcite recently identified 63 h@xmath38 emitting objects in a deep objective prism survey of the @xmath10 orionis region .",

    "the orion belt stars , @xmath10 ori and 25 ori are indicated by large blue starred symbols ; also labeled are the the outlying clouds l1615 and l1634 . ]    the main limitation of this technique is the strong bias towards h@xmath38-strong pms stars ; few wtts can be detected at the resolution of objective prisms ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in fact , out of 25 kiso sources matching confirmed pms stars in @xcite , only 3 objects ( 12% ) are wtts ; therefore , specially in somewhat older regions , in which most tts are of the wtts type , objective prism searches miss nearly 90% of the pms stars .",
    "another caveat is contamination by field stars .",
    "the spatial distribution of the kiso sources has been useful to outline the youngest regions in orion ( figure [ spatial_rass_kiso ] ) where the highest concentrations of ctts are located @xcite , but these samples can be dominated by objects like dme stars in regions far from the molecular clouds , in which the ctts / wtts fraction is small .",
    "@xcite find a ctts / wtts fraction of 11% in ori ob1a , and a slightly higher value of 23% in ori ob1b , indicating that the kiso searches missed the majority of the young population in these regions . only about 50% of the 218 kiso h@xmath38 sources located within the @xmath44 area surveyed by @xcite in the ob1a and ob1b sub - associations , fall above the zero age main sequence ( zams ) in the v vs. @xmath45 color - magnitude diagram , and just 33% of those",
    "are found to be variable ( a sign that they may be true tts , see sect .",
    "[ variability ] ) , as would be expected for tts ( figure [ fig3 ] ) ; these numbers suggest that the overall fraction of pms objects among kiso objects is probably not much greater than @xmath46% , and likely less in the extended area off the main orion clouds . therefore , objective prism studies require follow up spectroscopy to confirm membership .    -emitting stars from the kiso - schmidt survey , and x - ray sources , in the orion star forming region .",

    "-0.2 cm      x - ray observations are a well established tool to find active stars , like young pms stars . for nearby ob associations , which typically cover areas in the sky much larger than the field of view of x - ray observatories , deep pointed observations spanning many square degrees are usually not feasible .",
    "however , large scale shallow surveys have been conducted with great success .",
    "the rosat all sky survey provided coverage of the whole sky in the @xmath48  kev soft x - ray band . with a mean limiting flux of about @xmath49 ,",

    "the majority of the x - ray sources are concentrated toward the best known clusters inside the orion a and b clouds : the onc , ngc 2024 , 2068 and 2071 ; this is not surprising , since most deep pointings with x - ray observatories like _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ , and more recently _ asca _ , _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ have been done in these regions .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey sources in the off - cloud areas spanning ori ob1a and ob1b are distributed much more uniformly , except for the strong concentration near the early type star 25 ori and another overdensity in the l1615 cloud .",

    "@xcite found a density enhancement of rosat all - sky survey sources with a roughly circular extent of @xmath50 , centered at @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the rosat all - sky survey data are essentially complete only for @xmath60 pms stars in those regions . also , @xcite showed that , because x - ray activity decays slowly during the first 100 myr in solar - like stars , the rosat all - sky survey candidate pms samples in areas far from molecular clouds suffered from significant contamination by young main sequence stars of ages up to @xmath61 .",
    "these limitations have to be kept in mind when working with x - ray selected samples ; at any rate , follow - up observations are necessary to determine the nature of the objects .",
    "single epoch optical photometric surveys are frequently used to select candidate low - mass members of young clusters or associations .",
    "candidates are usually selected by their location in the optical color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) above the zams .",
    "the locus in which low - mass pms stars are located is usually defined by either a known ( spectroscopically confirmed ) population of pms stars , by comparison with theoretical model isochrones , or because the pms population of the association is clearly visible as a concentration on the cmd ( e.g. , figure [ vvi_var ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of photometric selection is that for a specified amount of time on any given telescope a region of the sky can be surveyed to a fainter limit than can be done by a variability survey , and low - mass candidate members can be selected without regard to their brightness variations , which could bias selection against objects with small amplitudes in their light curves .",
    "the disadvantage of this technique is that there is inevitably some contamination by foreground field stars and background giants ; in large areas with a lower density of low - mass association members , such as orion ob1b or orion ob1a the field star contamination can be large enough to make it difficult to see the pms locus ( see below ) .",

    "a subset of this study , centered on @xmath10 ori , was reported by @xcite .",

    "data for individual stars only exist for the likely pms members of the @xmath10 ori cluster ( see table 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "optical photometric variability is one of the defining characteristics of pms stars @xcite .",
    "however , due to limitations in the size of ccd detectors , past work on photometric variability of young stars have concentrated on follow up studies of selected samples , that had been identified as pms objects by some other means . only very recently has the potential of variability as a technique to pick out young stars amongst the field population started to be realized @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that in surveys spanning wide solid angles , the large number of objects limits the usefulness of traditional , single epoch cmds to single out the pms locus .",

    "could also be an incompleteness effect ; being a factor of @xmath73 further away than taurus and @xmath169 than ic 348 , the magnitude limited searches in orion have a larger low - mass limit ( i.e. , they are limited at an earlier spectral type ) .",
    "except for taurus , the distributions in figure [ sptypes_histo ] suggest a rough similarity between the imf in these regions , at least within the spectral type range k3-m6 .",
    "@xcite found that , at least down to spectral type @xmath170 , the ic 348 imf is consistent with that of the field , a result also obtained for the onc by several authors ( e.g. hillenbrand 1997 ; also see chapter by muench et al . ) . in the @xmath10",
    "ori cluster @xcite found that the imf in the range @xmath171 is consistent with the @xcite field imf ( see chapter by walter et al . in this volume ) . in the immediate vicinity of @xmath9 ori",
    ", @xcite derived an imf from @xmath172 that is similar to that derived in other young regions like the onc , @xmath38 per and the pleiades . over the entire @xmath9 ori star - forming region",
    ", @xcite found that while the global imf of the @xmath9 ori sfr resembles the field , the imf on smaller spatial scales appears to vary substantially ( see chapter by mathieu for a detailed discussion of the imf in the @xmath9 ori region ) .",
    "summarizing , the variations in the details of the imf among differing star - forming regions are still a matter of debate . as the census of low - mass stars in regions like",
    "the orion ob1 association becomes more complete , we will be in a better position to assess whether real differences exist , that could be related to the initial conditions of the star formation process .",
    "circumstellar disks around young stars play an important role in determining the final mass of the star and as potential sites for planet formation .",
    "we now recognize that dust particles suspended in the disk gas evolve , with solids coagulating and settling toward the midplane @xcite ; this dust growth and settling are thought to be the first stage in planetary accumulation @xcite .",
    "the presence of disks can be infered by optical signatures like strong emission in hydrogen balmer lines like h@xmath38 , produced by hot ( t @xmath173 k ) gas flowing through a magnetosphere , and by excess ir emission from warm dust in the disk , heated by irradiation from the central star . in order to investigate how these disks evolve and may give rise to planetary systems , it is necessary to characterize their properties in young stellar populations , at ages up to @xmath135 myr .",
    "so far , the most extensive studies of how circumstellar disk fractions change with time have been conducted in the orion ob1 association .",
    "however , the large majority of these investigations have concentrated on the youngest regions , or densest clusters ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "information on disks properties and fractions among the more widely spread pms population has become available only very recently .    in the mass range @xmath174 , characteristic of low - mass pms stars ,",
    "several studies have started to search for disks among the dispersed tts populations .",
    "@xcite , using the strong h@xmath38 emission in ctts as a proxy for disk accretion , and applying the ctts / wtts classification scheme by @xcite , derived the fraction of accreting ctts across ori ob1 .",
    "they obtained an accretor fraction of 11% in ori ob1a and 23% in ob1b .",
    "they compared their estimates with other regions in their figure 12 .",
    "@xcite , also counting the number of ctts , found an accretor fraction of 5.6% in the 25 ori cluster , while in a ori ob1b field , next to the belt star @xmath19 ori , the ctts fraction is 12.6% .",
    "these values are almost a factor of @xmath72 lower than those reported in @xcite .",
    "however , they argued that the apparent discrepancy can be explained because the ori ob1b sample in @xcite included very young regions like the area in and around the ngc 2024 cluster ( @xmath2 myr ) which has a large number of ctts , and is nominally located within the @xcite ori ob1b boundaries .",
    "second , as the census of pms stars in older regions like ori ob1a increases , the most frequent type of members are wtts , which tends to lower the accretor fraction .",
    "@xcite combined the sdss g , r , i , and z bands with 2mass jhk magnitudes , to construct reddening - invariant indices and classify wtts and ctts candidates ( see sect . [ variability ] ) .",
    "he found a ctts fraction of @xmath135% , similar to what @xcite derived . despite what",
    "the absolute ctts fractions may be in each region , what does seem like a robust result is the decline of a factor @xmath175 in the number of accreting stars between the @xmath24 myr old ob1b and the 7 - 10 myr old ob1a .",
    "@xcite combined uv , optical , jhkl and 10  @xmath176 m measurements in a sample of confirmed members of the ob1a and ob1b sub - associations to study dust emission and disk accretion .",
    "they showed evidence for an overall decrease in ir emission with age , interpreted as a sign of dust evolution between disks in ori ob1b ( @xmath24 myr ) , ori ob1a ( @xmath160 myr ) , and those of younger populations like taurus ( @xmath72 myr ) .",
    "figure [ fig_distmdot ] shows the distribution of the mass accretion rates derived by @xcite in ori ob1a and ob1b , compared with determinations for the taurus star - forming region ( mass accretion rates in taurus are from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in all three cases , there is a large spread in the values of @xmath177 .",
    "however , as time proceeds , the number of rapid accretors decreases , and only low accretors remain in ob1a .",
    "@xcite applied statistical tests and concluded that the distributions of accretion rates are significantly different between the three regions .",
    "this decrease of @xmath177 with age qualitatively agrees with expectations from viscous disk evolution .",
    "however , viscous evolution alone can not explain the decreasing fraction of accreting objects with age @xcite ; other factors ( e.g. inner disk clearing associated with planet formation , * ? ? ?",

    "there is also a decrease in the slope of the spectral energy distribution in the irac - mips diagram ( lower right panel in figure [ disks ] ) , but slower than in the irac - only plot ; the irac - mips slope corresponds to regions further out in the disk than the irac - only slope .",
    "the faster decrease in the ir dust emission from the inner parts of the disk is indicative of an `` inside - out '' clearing .    in their sample of very low - mass tts and young brown dwarfs",
    ", @xcite looked for the presence of accretion signatures by measuring the strength of the h@xmath38 line in emission . using the criteria by @xcite they classified their new members as having ctts or wtts nature .",

    "this indicates that the timescale for disk evolution is much shorter in young stars with masses in the range @xmath183 , which could be a consequence of more efficient mechanisms of inner disk dispersal .",
    "@xcite compared spitzer 24  @xmath176 m observations of b , a and f stars in ori ob1a and ob1b with similar objects in other stellar groups , spanning a range of ages from 2.5 to 150 myr , and found that debris disks are more frequent and have larger 24  @xmath176 m excess at ages @xmath135 myr ( ob1a ) .",

    "* ) , where large icy objects ( @xmath185 km ) begin to form at @xmath135 myr ; the presence of these objects in the disk initiates a collisional cascade , producing enough dust particles to explain the relatively large 24  @xmath176 m excesses observed in ori ob1a . combining spitzer observations , optical spectra , and 2mass data",

    "<S> the orion ob1 association , at a distance of roughly 400 pc and spanning over @xmath0 on the sky , is one of the largest and nearest ob associations . with a wide range of ages and environmental conditions </S>",
    "<S> , orion is an ideal laboratory for investigating fundamental questions related to the birth of stars and planetary systems . </S>",
    "<S> this rich region exhibits all stages of the star formation process , from very young , embedded clusters , to older , fully exposed young stars ; it also harbors dense clusters and widely spread populations in vast , low stellar density areas . </S>",
    "<S> this review focuses on the later , namely , the low - mass ( @xmath1 ) , pre - main sequence population spread over wide spatial scales in orion ob1 , mostly in the off - cloud areas . as ongoing studies </S>",
    "<S> yield more complete censa it becomes clearer that this `` distributed '' or non - clustered population , is as numerous as that located in the molecular clouds ; modern studies of star formation in orion would be incomplete if they did not include this widely spread population . </S>"
