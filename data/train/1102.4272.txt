    "the study of the wireless relay channel has attracted a lot of attention in recent times .",
    "achievable rates and the upper bounds on the capacity for the full duplex ( fd ) discrete memoryless relay channel ( dmc ) were studied in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the practical constraints involved in the construction of relays which can transmit and receive simultaneously , the bounds on the capacity for the so - called cheap relay networks were derived @xcite .",
    "we will refer to such a relay channel as the half - duplex ( hd ) relay channel in this paper .",
    "these results were extended to the gaussian relay channel with continuous input and output alphabets @xcite .    for a single - user gaussian channel ,",
    "if the input is constrained to come from a finite complex constellation with the points used with uniform distribution , the mutual information between the input and the output of the channel is called the constellation constrained capacity ( ccc ) in @xcite . similar notion of ccc",
    "was studied for the gaussian - mac channel in @xcite and for the gaussian interference channel in @xcite with finite complex input constellations . in this paper",
    "we study bounds ( both upper and lower bounds ) on the achievable rate of the relay channel with finite complex input constellations .",
    "the lower bound on the achievable rate of the relay channel is defined as be the achievable rate of the decode and forward scheme @xcite , when the input symbols take values from a finite constellation .",
    "similarly , the cut - set bound given by the max - flow min cut theorem @xcite , when the input symbols take values from a finite constellation , is referred to as the upper bound on the achievable rate .",
    "if the expressions for the bounds involve maximization with the respect to the joint distribution of random variables , it is assumed that the random variables are independent and uniformly distributed . for the fading relay channel ,",
    "since the mutual information expressions which appear in the bounds are functions of the fading coefficients , expectation with respect to the fading coefficients is taken .",
    "results from @xcite , where the capacity bounds and optimal power allocation strategies for the wireless fd and hd relay channel were studied , reveal that for the gaussian input alphabet , the gain in rate offered by the relay channel over the direct transmission without the relay node , referred to as the relay gain , is significant and in particular at high snr , this gain becomes a constant .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are as follows .",
    "* we present lower and upper bounds on the achievable rate of the relay channel for both the fd and hd scenarios . *",
    "it is shown that for the case of finite input constellations , the relay gain attains the maximum at a particular snr and at higher snrs the relay gain tends to become zero .",
    "since practical schemes always use finite input constellation , this result means that the relay offers maximum advantage over the direct transmission when we operate at a particular snr . *",
