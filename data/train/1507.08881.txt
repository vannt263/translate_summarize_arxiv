    "one of the most active fields in physics in recent years has been the search for majorana fermions @xcite . despite being theoretically predicted more than 70 years ago @xcite , the existence of majorana fermions as _ elementary _ particles is still unclear .",
    "however , it was recently recognized that they can occur as quasiparticles in various solid - state systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , certain one - dimensional ( 1d ) wires are believed to host localized majorana bound states ( mbs ) due to the combined effects of rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) , proximity - coupling to a superconductor , and an externally applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these mbs can be understood using simple single - particle quantum mechanics .",
    "exotic and closely related bound states , called parafermions , have been predicted to descend from strongly correlated phases such as the edges of fractional quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "the practical interest in these unusual quasiparticles stems primarily from their suitability for topologically - protected quantum computation @xcite . exploiting their non - abelian exchange statistics ,",
    "many logic gates can be implemented by braiding , an operation which is robust to local perturbations .",
    "indeed , the prospect of intrinsically decoherence - free qubit operations is a strong driving force for this research field , and has the potential to revolutionize quantum computation .",
    "if experimentally confirmed , mbs and parafermions will be the first discovered particles with non - abelian exchange statistics .",
    "edge states of two - dimensional topological insulators , ferromagnetic chains on superconductors , as well as semiconductor nanowires with rsoc have recently shown experimental signatures that are consistent with the appearance of mbs @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent work @xcite suggests that it is possible to observe @xmath3 periodic components of the josephson current arising from majorana fermions , giving a window on their twofold degeneracy .",
    "measured current - voltage curves for proximitized edge states of hgte and nanowires with rsoc have shown the disappearance of odd numbered `` shapiro steps '' consistent with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , experimental results indicating the presence of parafermions do not yet exist , largely because the proposed experimental setups are difficult to realize .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to tackle this lack of experimental realization of parafermions by describing a rather simple arrangement in which a single interacting 1d rashba wire exhibits fourfold degenerate zero - energy states obeying a @xmath0 parafermionic algebra ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our proposed system exploits a generic interaction process which has so far not been examined in quantum wires , called spin - umklapp scattering , whereby two spin - up fermions are scattered into two spin - down fermions .",
    "such an interaction arises from virtual transitions between subbands , and for a suitable choice of the chemical potential opens a partial gap in the energy spectrum of the wire .",
    "adding proximity - induced superconductivity then leads to the emergence of parafermion bound states at the ends of the wire , whose fourfold degeneracy is protected by kramers theorem as long as time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) is not broken . as a definitive experimental signature , we point out that tunneling of the fractionalized quasiparticles with charge @xmath2 will result in an @xmath1 periodic component of the josephson current , which could be seen in shapiro step experiments .",
    "we note that the required interaction strengths have already been reached in quantum wires @xcite , and that the opening of the spin - umklapp gap may already have been seen in recent experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the predicted fourfold degeneracy and the associated josephson effect are robust to weak disorder , of the magnitude of the gap which is opened by spin - umklapp scattering .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model for an interacting rashba wire and derive the spin - umklapp scattering term .",
    "we then bosonize this model in section 3 , and present a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis for the flow of the system parameters .",
    "we find there exist regimes in which fourfold degenerate edge states can be found . in section 4 , we describe the implications of the degenerate ground state for josephson effect measurements , and suggest a definitive shapiro step measurement to identify the @xmath4 contribution to the josephson current arising from parafermions , even when this contribution is sub - dominant .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we discuss the relevance of our work for experimental investigations .",
    "we consider a long quasi-1d nanowire along the @xmath5 direction which is harmonically confined in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions .",
    "the interplay of the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling of a material and the breaking of inversion symmetry of a particular geometric arrangement , due to either the presence of a substrate , or to the application of an out of plane electric field , gives rise to rsoc @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the strength of the electric field may be used to tune the magnitude of the rsoc , denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "the dynamics in the @xmath7-direction is not affected by the rashba coupling and can be safely ignored .",
    "thus , we can model a finite - width wire by using the following 2d hamiltonian including rsoc with strength @xmath8",
    "@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the momentum components in the @xmath5- and @xmath6-directions , and @xmath12 are pauli matrices .",
    "the transversal confinement is modelled as a harmonic potential with frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the system has translational invariance along the @xmath5-direction but is strongly confined along the @xmath6-direction , which leads to the appearance of higher excited bands separated from the lowest band by a spacing determined by the inverse width of the wire . introducing raising and lowering operators , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
