    "normally stellar evolution proceeds on time - scales of millions or billions of years .",
    "notable exceptions are e.g. supernovae , though such cataclysmic events only mark the end point of the evolution as normal stars . witnessing stellar evolution in real time without a simultaneous complete destruction of the star is thus very rare .",
    "`` born - again '' giants do , however , offer such a remarkable opportunity , which offers important windows through which stellar nucleosynthesis and evolution can be glimpsed .    on its initial descent of the white dwarf cooling track , a star may be ballooned back to supergiant dimensions by a final he - shell flash which is triggered by the compressional heating of the stellar interior . rather than fading steadily to oblivion as a white dwarf",
    "the star makes a second appearance as a luminous giant , a `` born - again '' giant .",
    "theoretical estimates suggest that about 10% of all low- and intermediate mass stars going through a planetary nebula phase will experience such a final he - shell flash ( renzini 1990 ; iben et al .",
    "the observational rarity of such events is the result of the very short life - time as a born - again giant  typically 100 - 1000 years , depending mainly on the stellar envelope mass  before it completes its loop in the hertzsprung - russell diagram and once again starts contracting to become a white dwarf , this time for good .    to date",
    ", only three stars are believed to have been observed going through a born - again phase : v605aql ( nova aql 1919 ) , fgsge and the recently discovered sakurai s object ( v4334sgr ) ( nakano et al .",
    "1996 ) . a further handful of stars ( e.g. abell 30 and abell 78 ) presently in a seemingly second stage as planetary nebulae may be identified as having recently been born - again giants .",
    "furthermore , the rcrb variables could also possibly be born - again giants ( asplund et al . 1997b ; asplund et al . 1998 ; lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) ; their h - deficiency can be explained if the final he - shell flash occurs after the outer h - burning shell has been extinguished , in which case the convection zone due to the he - flash may ingest and burn the h - rich envelope .",
    "both v605aql , fgsge and sakurai s object have shown a remarkably fast stellar evolution . from having been an o star at the end of last century ( van genderen & gautschy 1995 ) , fgsge has continued to brighten in the visual while cooling , presumably the result of the expansion following the final he - shell flash ( see kipper 1996 for a recent review ) . furthermore , an enrichment of @xmath0-process elements which took place within seven years has been reported ( langer et al . 1974 ) . lately , fgsge has also started to show rcrb - like variability ( papousek 1992 ) , which may classify the star as a `` new - born '' rcrb star , in particular since there are hints that the star may be h - deficient ( gonzalez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "after discovery in 1996 , sakurai s object has shown an exceedingly rapid evolution , even out - pacing fgsge ; whether or not it is evolving faster than v605aql is difficult to judge considering the scarceness of data from the outburst in 1919 but the evolutionary speed for v605aql may have been comparable ( clayton & de marco 1997 ) .",
    "like fgsge sakurai s object has cooled significantly ( asplund et al .",
    "1997b ; duerbeck et al .",
    "more impressively though , its chemical composition seems to have been altered drastically on a time - scale of a mere few months ( asplund et al .",
    "fgsge s title as the `` fastest evolving star ever identified '' ( van genderen & gautschy 1995 ) is certainly called in doubt by sakurai s object .",
    "sakurai s object offers a unique opportunity to study stellar evolution and attendant nucleosynthesis in real time .",
    "several papers has been devoted to the star and its remarkable evolution ( e.g. asplund et al .",
    "1997b ; duerbeck & benetti 1996 ; duerbeck et al . 1997",
    "; eyres et al . 1998 ; jacoby et al . 1998 ; kimeswenger & kerber 1998 ; kipper & klochkova 1997 ; shetrone & keane 1998 ) . however , the published abundance analyses of the star have relied on very different model atmospheres and spectral features , making a direct comparison of the results difficult .",
    "therefore we have re - analysed the available published ( asplund et al .",
    "1997b ; kipper & klochkova 1997 ; shetrone & keane 1998 ) and unpublished ( d. pollacco and g. wallerstein ) spectra in a homogeneous way , using the same model atmospheres and whenever possible the same spectral lines to avoid as far as possible systematic differences .",
    "the resultant map of the evolution of the composition offers important clues to the star s immediate past history .",
    "some of the observations on which the present study is based have previously been used by asplund et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , kipper & klochkova ( 1997 ) and shetrone & keane ( 1998 ) for abundance analyses .",
    "for completeness we repeat the observational details here , together with the relevant information on the previously unpublished spectra .",
    "the spectra of asplund et al .",
    "( 1997b ) cover 3700 - 10150@xmath2 at a resolving power of about 30000 and were obtained with the 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory on may 5 and 6 and on october 7 , 1996 .",
    "another spectrum was acquired with the mcdonald 2.1 m telescope on may 9 , 1996 , which covers the region 5720  to 7200  at a resolving power of about 60000 ; the three may spectra have been combined to a single line list .",
    "shetrone & keane ( 1998 ) observed sakurai s object on april 20 , 1996 , with ctio 4 m telescope with a resolving power of about 14000 .",
    "the spectrum covers the region 3800 - 7500@xmath2 with s / n ranging from 100 to 200 , depending on the wavelength region .",
    "in addition g. wallerstein ( unpublished research ) obtained a spectrum of the star with the ctio 4 m telescope at a resolving power of about 12500 on april 25 .",
    "the two april spectra have here been combined to one line list though greater weight has been given to the april 20 spectrum due to its higher quality . a spectrum obtained with the william",
    "herschel 4.2 m telescope ( pollacco , unpublished research ) was acquired on june 4 , 1996 , at a resolving power of 45000 and s / n of about 70 .",
    "the spectrum covers the wavelength region 3800 - 8000 .",
    "finally , kipper & klochkova ( 1997 ) obtained spectra of the star on july 3 , 1996 , with the echelle spectrometer on the russian 6 m telescope , providing a spectral resolving power of about 20000 and s / n of around 75 .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 5000 - 8000 .",
    "in addition , other spectra obtained by us or kindly provided by various colleagues have been attempted for abundance analyses , but in all cases the resolution proved insufficient for reliable results , and they are therefore not included in the present study .    with the exceptions of a few spectral regions for which spectral synthesis was carried out ( see below ) ,",
    "the abundance analysis is based on lines for which equivalent widths could be measured readily .",
    "the line lists for the april , june and july spectra were modelled following the lines used by asplund et al .",
    "( 1997b ) for the may and october observations",
    "whenever the spectral coverage allowed .",
    "the lines are thus in general not the same in the present study as in the original works by shetrone & keane ( 1998 ) and kipper & klochkova ( 1997 ) .",
    "spectral synthesis was applied to a few wavelength regions of particular interest : h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , the c@xmath5 swan 0 - 1 and 1 - 0 band - heads , the lid doublet at 6707 , the blended cii lines at 6578.05@xmath2 and 6582.88@xmath2 and the he i d@xmath6 line at 5876 , which is blended by two ci lines .",
    "the adopted atomic data were the same as in lambert et al .",
    "the @xmath7-values for the ci lines present in the above synthesized regions were decreased according to the magnitude of the `` carbon problem '' ( typically 0.7dex ) of the individual spectra , see sect .",
    "[ s : param ] .",
    "in order to derive accurate stellar parameters a range of different @xmath8 and log@xmath9 criteria was utilized : ionization balance ( mainly ni / nii , sii / siii , cri / crii , and fei / feii ) , excitation balance ( oi , fei and feii ) , and line strengths of sensitive spectral features ( c@xmath5 , cii and hei lines ) . the extended line wings of h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 allowed a determination of the stellar h abundance , but the profiles also provided additional information on the adopted @xmath8 and log@xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ f : hbeta ] ) .",
    "the microturbulence parameter @xmath10 was estimated mainly from ci , tiii , fei , feii and yii lines of different strengths ; to within the uncertainties all species indicated the same @xmath10 . the derived temperatures from @xmath11 colours ( duerbeck et al .",
    "1997 ) assuming a reddening of @xmath12 ( n.k .",
    "rao , private communication ) provided another temperature estimate which was in very good agreement with the other criteria ( fig .",

    "line - blanketed , hydrogen - deficient model atmospheres similar to those described by asplund et al .",
    "( 1997a ) but with a range of hydrogen abundances especially constructed for the present analysis formed the basis of the investigation .",
    "since the present study of the may and october 1996 spectra is based on the same observations , spectral lines and model atmospheres as in asplund et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , the previously derived stellar parameters for may ( @xmath13k , log@xmath14 , @xmath15kms@xmath16 ) and october ( @xmath17k , log@xmath18 , @xmath19kms@xmath16 ) did not warrant a re - consideration .",
    "within the framework of the present analysis the april spectrum is characterized by @xmath20k , log@xmath21 and @xmath22kms@xmath16 .",
    "the june spectrum indicates @xmath23k , log@xmath24 and @xmath25kms@xmath16 .",
    "similarly the july spectrum is adequately described using @xmath26k , log@xmath27 and @xmath25kms@xmath16 .",
    "the slight differences compared with the original analyses of kipper & klochkova ( 1997 ) and shetrone & keane ( 1998 ) are not alarming considering the very different adopted model atmospheres as well as the use of different @xmath8-log@xmath9 criteria .",
    "the quoted uncertainties in the derived parameters represent the discrepancies between the various indicators ; additional systematic errors are not accounted for .",
    "however , since the same criteria has been used , the systematic errors are likely very similar for the different observing epochs , and thus will not compromise our conclusions regarding the very rapid evolution of the star .",

    "it should be emphasized , however , that these lines do not provide a very accurate estimate of the c / he ratio in cool h - deficient stars such as sakurai s object due to the sensitivity of the lines to the adopted stellar parameters and the significant contribution of blending ci lines with their unexplained `` carbon problem '' ( see below ) to the hei 5876@xmath2 triplet .",
    "the june and july spectra are consistent with the adopted c / he ratio of 10% , though a better agreement between the cii and hei lines would be obtained with a slightly higher ratio .",
    "the @xmath8 in october was too low to enable a determination of the c / he ratio through the high - excitation hei and cii lines .    in the h - deficient and c - rich photospheres of sakurai s object and the rcrb stars ,",
    "the continuous opacity at the flux - carrying wavelengths is no longer provided by hydrogen but by photoionization of highly excited levels of ci .",
    "furthermore , carbon is by far the most important electron donor in the line - forming regions .",
    "the atmospheric structure is therefore essentially completely determined by c ( asplund et al .",
    "since the photospheric c abundance is derived from lines originating from levels with only slightly lower excitation energy than those providing the continuous opacity , the strengths of ci lines in these stars should be essentially independent on both the c abundance and the adopted @xmath8 and log@xmath9 , which is also confirmed by observations and theoretical calculations ( lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) . therefore",
    ", the theoretical line strengths of weak ci lines should agree with observations since there are no free parameters to tune in order to achieve agreement as in normal analyses .",
    "this is unfortunately neither the case for the rcrb stars ( gustafsson & asplund 1996 ; asplund et al . 1997a ; lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) nor for sakurai s object ( asplund et al . 1997b",
    "; kipper & klochkova 1997 ) ; all analyses reveal a significant discrepancy between the predicted and observed line strengths to the extent that the derived abundance is about 0.6dex smaller than the input c abundance for the model atmospheres .",
    "the explanation for this `` carbon problem '' is still unknown , but it may be related to inappropriate assumptions for the construction of the model atmospheres ( 1-d , static , flux - constant atmospheres in lte ) ( lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "sakurai s object also shows the same discrepancy by on average 0.7dex . as will be illustrated further below",
    ", the abundances of most elements have remained the same throughout 1996 , which suggests that the c / he ratio has not changed ; an increasing c abundance would manifest itself as a decrease in derived abundances for all elements when assuming a constant c / he in the analysis unless for some reason x / c remained the same for all elements except for he .",
    "fortunately , various tests ( lambert et al . 1998 ) suggest that although absolute abundances can be severely affected , abundance ratios such as [ x / fe ] are largely immune to the carbon problem because of the similar sensitivity to the atmospheric structure of most elements ; changing c / he from 10% to 1% introduces differences in [ x / fe ] by @xmath42dex ( asplund et al .",
    "therefore , conclusions regarding the evolutionary history of sakurai s object and the rcrb stars can still be drawn , in spite of the unsolved dilemma caused by the carbon problem .",

    "the abundances for may and october have been re - analysed for the present study , which has led to a few minor adjustments compared with the original study ( asplund et al .",
    "1997b ) : the abundances of ne , k , fe , cu and zn have all increased by 0.1dex for may , as a result of inclusion of additional lines , improved selection of lines and adoption of better atomic data . from an inspection of table [ t : abund ]",
    "two important conclusions are immediately obvious .",
    "first , the abundances of most elements ( he , c , n , o , ne , na , mg , al , si , p , s , k , ca , fe , ni , cu and la ) have remained the same within the uncertainties ( about 0.3dex ) throughout 1996 . in most cases",
    "the total variation is only about 0.2dex , which is remarkable considering the intrinsic uncertainties in the analyses .",
    "given the good agreement , it is worthwhile emphasizing , that in all cases the adopted stellar parameters have been determined before considering the absolute abundances and their implications , and no a posteriori fine - tuning has been allowed in order to improve the consistency .",
    "second , several elements show abundance alterations which significantly exceed the statistical scatter .",
    "this is true for h ( decrease by 1.0dex ) , li ( @xmath133dex ) , sc ( @xmath134dex ) , zn ( @xmath135dex ) , rb ( @xmath136dex ) and y ( @xmath137dex ) , and probably also ti ( @xmath133dex ) , cr ( @xmath133dex ) , sr ( @xmath135dex , though uncertain due to only based on very strong lines ) and zr ( @xmath138dex ) .",
    "there is also some indication that the heavier @xmath0-element ba increased steadily in 1996 , though such a conclusion is not indisputable .",
    "unfortunately , trustworthy abundances of other heavy @xmath0-elements throughout 1996 which could verify such a finding are lacking . the slightly larger variations ( in total 0.4dex ) than the typical scatter for si , s and ca are less likely to be signs of real abundance variations , since no definite trend with time is apparent and only one of the epochs show a disparate value .",
    "we therefore attribute these variations to the uncertainties in the analyses .    for june and july",
    "the h abundance may be overestimated by @xmath139dex compared with the other epochs , since the abundances are derived solely from h@xmath3 as the spectra did not cover h@xmath4 . for the other times",
    "the greatest weight has been given to h@xmath4 , which in general needs slightly lower abundance than h@xmath3 for an acceptable fit to the extended line wings in sakurai s object .",
    "considering the drastic abundance variations apparent in sakurai s object , it is natural to ask whether perhaps they can be blamed on erroneous stellar parameters or inappropriate approximations in the analysis .",
    "it is important to realize that all abundance alterations can not be simultaneously annuled by _ any _ change in the adopted stellar parameters , regardless of how large the variation of the parameters .",
    "the required @xmath140k to invalidate most of the abundance changes would be clearly incompatible with the various @xmath8-log@xmath9 criteria and furthermore would only introduce other severe modifications of the stellar abundances , which would be less easily explainable within the context of a born - again giant .",
    "most of the elements showing an increasing or decreasing abundance trend are not more sensitive than the elements whose abundance has remained constant in the same time - span .",
    "the observation of a definite trend in abundance over time for all elements with a suspected abundance change , further supports the finding of a changing chemical composition .",
    "likewise , the consistency between the different epochs for most elements also speaks against the stellar parameters being seriously in error .",
    "many of the spectral lines of the species with changing chemical content are by necessity relatively strong , which could cause problems in their interpretation as abundances .",
    "the effects of hyperfine and isotope splittings have been investigated for a few li , sc , y and ba lines but found to be insignificant except for the liid doublet ; the li abundances in table [ t : abund ] have been derived from such synthesis . since the current analysis",
    "is based on the lte approximation , departures from lte may introduce spurious results which could be interpreted as abundance variations .",
    "we , however , find it unlikely that such departures may be responsible for all of the observed drastic variations ( in some cases 1.0dex ) , since ( 1 ) in most cases the abundances are derived from lines of the dominant species in the atmosphere ( exceptions : li , zn and rb ) , ( 2 ) the line scatter of the relevant elements is similar or smaller than for the other elements , ( 3 ) in general the abundances are based on more lines than for the typical elements , ( 4 ) other elements with similar atomic structures , which thus should experience similar departures from lte , do not show any abundance variations , and ( 5 ) it seems less likely that the relatively minor differences in stellar parameters between the four observing epochs could introduce _ differential _ nlte effects of @xmath141dex .",
    "naturally though , it can not be excluded that nlte effects may be accountable for parts of the observed abundance alterations for some elements , e.g. for ti and cr ( see below ) .    as will be further discussed below",
    ", the abundance variations can be naturally explained as a result of the mixing and nucleosynthesis which has occurred following the final he - shell flash  h - burning , li - production and @xmath0-processing  which furthers supports the conclusion that the changes are real .",
    "the elements which should not participate in any nuclear reactions to any significant extent by the he - shell flash do not show any abundance variations , thereby making the whole abundance pattern consistent with expectations .    in the absence of any plausible alternative explanation , we are thus forced to the conclusion that the observed changes in chemical composition are most likely real .",
    "the abundance alterations first noted by asplund et al .",
    "( 1997b ) are thus confirmed by the present , more detailed analysis covering significantly more observational data .",
    "the current chemical composition of sakurai s object is clearly not pristine .",
    "the very evolved nature of the star is evidenced by the h - deficiency and high abundances of heavy elements , not characteristic of neither disk dwarfs nor halo dwarfs ( edvardsson et al .",
    "sakurai s object seem to have undergone h - burning , followed by he - burning and a second phase of cno - cycling , as well as associated nuclear reactions such as li - production and @xmath0-processing .",
    "sakurai s object is slightly metal - poor . with a c",
    "/ he ratio of 10% the fe mass fraction is 0.2dex ( mean of the four observing epochs ) below solar , but had instead the input carbon abundance been used the mass fraction would be 0.7dex lower as a result of the carbon problem",

    "[ s : abundchanges ] ) .",
    "the most obvious property is , of course , the presence of h - burning material due to the h - deficiency and high he - content .",
    "furthermore , the high [ na / fe]@xmath148 and [ al / fe]@xmath149 abundance ratios can probably be explained by proton - captures on @xmath150ne and @xmath151 mg .",
    "the significant c and o ( [ o / fe]@xmath148 ) enhancements require he - burning through the 3@xmath3-process followed by subsequent @xmath3-captures .",
    "the overabundant n ( [ n / fe]=2.0 ) can not be accounted for by cno - cycling of the initial cno nuclei but requires a second phase of h - burning in which c and o produced by he - burning are converted to n. such a conclusion is supported by the very high [ ne / fe]@xmath152 ; ne has presumably been synthesized from @xmath3-captures on products of he - burning and cno - cycling ( since mg is not overabundant , ne has more likely been formed from @xmath153n seeds rather than @xmath154o nuclei ) .",
    "also the low @xmath155c/@xmath1c ratio in sakurai s object strongly suggests a second stage of cno - cycling following he - burning , since the @xmath1c abundance should be very low after @xmath3-processing ; the observed @xmath155c/@xmath1c ratio ( @xmath156c@xmath157c@xmath158 ) encompasses the equilibrium value of about 3.5 from cno - cycling .",
    "the high @xmath1c / n ratio requires though that the proton supply was exhausted before conversion of the available c to n was completed .",
    "the si and s abundances may also require nuclear processing , as in other h - deficient stars ( lambert et al .",

    "sakurai s object is strongly enhanced in @xmath0-process elements , in particular the light @xmath0-elements .",
    "also the very high abundance ratios [ k / fe]=0.8 , [ sc / fe]=1.6 ( october ) , [ ni / fe]=0.9 , [ cu / fe]=1.8 and [ zn / fe]=1.7 ( october ) are likely explained by neutron captures of lighter seed nuclei ( presumably mainly s , ar , ca and fe ) , as previously suggested for rcrb stars ( asplund et al . 1998 ; lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) and fgsge ( gonzalez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "very likely @xmath1c is the neutron source ; the alternative reaction @xmath150ne(@xmath3,n)@xmath151 mg which ignites at higher temperatures , seems to be ruled out since the required neutron exposure ( @xmath159 neutrons per fe seed nucleus ) is not consistent with the observed mg / fe ( @xmath160 ) ratio .",
    "all the elements ni - la could be synthesized with a _ single _",
    "neutron exposure @xmath161mb@xmath16 ; the sr / rb ratio indicates a neutron density of @xmath162@xmath163 ( malaney 1987 ) .",
    "an exponential exposure of neutrons provides less good agreement .",
    "the fact that also the abundances of ni , cu and zn are well explained with a single neutron exposure indicates that most of the envelope has been exposed to neutrons and little dilution with gas which has not suffered @xmath0-processing has occurred . though [ ba / fe]=0.6 is not atypical for agb - stars , many of the light @xmath0-elements have very extreme ratios ( e.g. [ sr / fe]=3.0 and [ y / fe]=2.2 in may ) not observed in agb - stars or post - agb stars evolving towards the planetary nebula - phase for the first time , which may suggest that these elements have been synthesized following departure from the agb .",
    "indeed , both the li and the ( light ) @xmath0-element abundances seem to have increased dramatically throughout 1996 , due to mixing and processing which was initiated in connection with the final he - shell flash .",
    "though most elemental abundances remained the same throughout 1996 , a few elements are distinguished by their changing content within only a few months .",
    "these variations may be the result of either mixing of a previously modified chemical composition or current nuclear processing .",
    "the mixing time - scale is determined by the convective time - scale which is on the order of a couple of months for sakurai s object .",
    "the nuclear burning time - scale is comparable since it is determined by convection to bring fresh protons to h - burning temperatures .",
    "thus , both processes may in principle be able to explain the extremely rapid evolution of sakurai s object .      rather than reflecting current nucleosynthesis in the star",
    ", the elemental abundance variations may simply be due to mixing of the surface layers with gas from the interior .",
    "if the initial envelope abundances are significantly different from those of the interior , a changing chemical content may be observed without invoking present nuclear processing .",
    "such a depth - dependent chemical composition may either be the result of previous nucleosynthesis ( which must have occurred _ during _ the agb - phase ) , or through dust - gas separation ( which must have occurred _",
    "after _ departure from the agb ) .",
    "pure mixing of the envelope with the h - depleted gas of the interior could in principle explain the decreasing h - content . however , some amount of h - burning is expected after the final he - shell flash on theoretical grounds ( renzini 1979 ) , since the flash should have caused an extensive convection zone ingesting the still h - rich envelope , which would bring the gas to h - burning temperatures . though mixing may explain part of the diminishing h abundance , it is not possible to invoke mixing to explain the increasing li content .",
    "since sakurai s object is h - deficient and h - burning necessarily destroys any present amount of the much more fragile li , the observed high li abundance can not have been inherited from a previous agb - phase .",
    "the observed li / h ratio ( @xmath164 ) far exceeds the value in even the most li - rich agb - stars ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "the observed changes of the light @xmath0-elements may be the consequences of mixing with gas exposed to neutrons in between the thermal pulses on the agb now brought to the surface .",
    "unfortunately , the exact nature of the last flashes immediately before departing from the agb is poorly known , but a preferential production of the light @xmath0-elements as observed is not inconceivable . whether the very extreme [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ( e.g. [ rb / fe]=2.9 , [ sr / fe]=3.3 and [ y / fe]=2.9 in october ) could be accomplished remains to be shown , however . as noted in sect .",
    "[ s : nucleo ] the abundance distribution of the heavy elements is better described with a single neutron exposure rather than an exponential exposure as expected for thermal pulses in agb - stars , which may indicate that the @xmath0-elements are not inherited from the previous agb - phase .",
    "the fact that the heavy element abundances in sakurai s object even before the observed abundance alterations in 1996 are quite different from those observed in post - agb stars evolving towards the planetary nebula - regime for the first time , also seems to support this conclusion .",
    "the observed abundance increases in ti and cr are more problematic to explain as a result of nucleosynthesis , whether from a previous phase or presently occurring . in principle ,",
    "ti and cr could be synthesized through @xmath0-processing , as is the case with sc .",
    "both ti and cr are , however , preceded by elements ( sc and v respectively ) which have significantly lower abundances .",
    "the neutron capture cross - sections ( beer et al .",
    "1992 ) do not suggest a predominant build - up of ti and cr at the expense of the surrounding elements .",
    "( though zn succeeds the less abundant cu for october 1996 , the calculations of malaney ( 1987 ) show that a single neutron exposure may produce such an abundance distribution due to the differences in cross - sections . ) furthermore , to explain the high cr abundance for october , the ca abundance would have had to decrease if it were the seed , which is not observed .",
    "conceivably , repeated @xmath3-captures could explain the ti and cr abundance increases , in particular in the light of the high [ ne / fe ] , [ si / fe ] and [ s / fe ] ratios , but it would seem to require unreasonably high temperatures . furthermore , ca is not significantly enhanced . in the light of a lacking plausible nucleosynthetic explanation",
    ", it is not precluded that a combination of errors ( e.g. nlte effects , unaccountable blends ) may have conspired to produce spurious results , especially since the interpretation of an abundance alteration of ti and cr is largely controlled by the october spectrum , while the [ ti / fe ] and [ cr / fe ] ratios for the other dates are representative of slightly metal - poor stars . for the moment , we are unable to find a nucleosynthetic explanation for the observed trends in ti and cr .",
    "we note that a similar problem of observed high [ ti / fe ] and [ cr / fe ] ratios also exists for some rcrb stars ( lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) .    alternatively , mixing may cause variations not because the interior has undergone previous phases of nucleosynthesis , but because the surface layers have experienced dust fractionation , as e.g. suggested for post - agb stars and fgsge ( blcker & schnberner 1997 ) .",
    "such a suggestion may seem able to explain the observed increases in sc , ti , cr and y , since those elements can be heavily depleted in post - agb stars ( e.g. gonzalez et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , the scenario is unlikely to be the main solution to the observed variations .",
    "elements such as al , ca , fe and ni should then also show similar or stronger trends which are not observed , and the increase in zn abundance is directly at odds with its inability to condense into dust ( cardelli 1994 ) . also , the variations in the h and li content cause severe problems for the suggestion .",
    "furthermore , dust depletion can not explain the abundance ratios relative to fe during the later times , in particular the extreme @xmath0-element ratios ( e.g. [ rb / fe]=2.9 , [ sr / fe]=3.3 and [ y / fe]=2.9 in october ) , when the abundance pattern should be less affected by the actions of dust fractionation .",
    "it is also hard to understand why exactly those elements which are likely to be synthesized in connection with a final he - shell flash ( h , li , and the @xmath0-elements ) should be particularly modified while no other elements show similar trends .",
    "we therefore find such an explanation rather contrived .",
    "similar arguments can be constructed against the suggestion of dust fractionation being responsible for the observed variations in the abundances of the @xmath0-elements in fgsge ( langer et al .",
    "1974 ; blcker & schnberner 1997 ) .",
    "the most notable abundance alteration in 1996 is the decreasing h - content by a factor of 10 , due to the ingestion of the h - rich envelope in connection with the he - flash .",
    "since most of the luminosity is now probably provided by h - burning rather than he - burning ( renzini 1990 ) , the diminishing h - content is in fact the nuclear fuel of the star being consumed .",
    "not only is the generated energy sufficient to provide the high luminosity of the star , the released energy is also causing the expansion of the star to giant dimensions . assuming a mass of @xmath166m@xmath167 of the ingested material and an initial h content of log@xmath168 ( april ) , the liberated energy over six months produces a luminosity which exceeds the classical eddington limit by about a factor of 6 ( see also sect . [",
    "s : tefflum ] ) .",
    "the generated energy during these months is less than the estimated binding energy of the stellar envelope outside the he - burning shell ( assuming the shell being located at a stellar radius of @xmath169 cm and a mass of the convective shell of @xmath170m@xmath167 , renzini 1990 ) .",
    "however , assuming instead an initial solar h - abundance prior to the he - shell flash in the ingested material is sufficient to provide the required energy for lifting the outer layers to produce a born - again giant .",
    "these simple - minded estimates naturally assume that the diminishing h - content only reflects the effects of h - burning rather than mixing of the envelope with previously h - depleted gas from the interior .",
    "the increased li abundance is most easily explained by li - production through the cameron - fowler mechanism .",
    "since h - burning also destroys present li , the observed li can not have been generated in a previous agb - phase but must be currently produced in the star , simultaneous with the consumption of h. furthermore , since the required @xmath171he , which is produced during the main - sequence phase , is eradicated during he - burning , the li - production must proceed in an environment not previously exposed to he - burning .",
    "the high @xmath1c abundance provides an efficient neutron source for the @xmath0-processing through @xmath1c(@xmath172o .",
    "the abundance alterations of the light @xmath0-process elements ( zn , rb , sr , y and zr , as well as sc ) can be interpreted as being due to current synthesis in the star ; it is less clear whether this is also true for the heavy @xmath0-elements though there are indications that ba may have increased in 1996 . as discussed above",
    ", the abundance distribution of the heavy elements suggests that the variations are not due to pure mixing , but rather to ongoing @xmath0-processing .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , however , it may pose a serious challenge for any theoretical modelling .",
    "the ignition of cn - cycling due to initiated flash - driven envelope convection at a temperature of @xmath173k should cause a splitting of the shell into two convective zones , the lower one burning he at the bottom , while the upper experiencing cn - cycling .",
    "as described above , li can be produced in the upper zone ( `` hot - bottom - burning '' ) , but the @xmath1c produced there does not release neutrons unless the temperature is significantly higher ( @xmath174k ) , i.e. in conditions typical of the lower convection zone .",
    "a possible solution may be that h - burning has essentially run to completion during the peak he - burning phase , in which case the two convection zones would once again connect , and thereby bringing down @xmath1c to the relevant high temperatures for neutron release to occur .",
    "no doubt , the final he - shell flash in sakurai s object was a highly dynamical phenomenon with a very short timescale ( @xmath175months ) , which may well have been severely inhomogeneous , similar to what is observed in simulations of supernovae . such asymmetric mixing",
    "may perhaps explain the simultaneous li - production and @xmath0-processing .",
    "it is even possible that the surface layers may not have been chemically homogeneous during 1996 and further variations in the observed abundances of h , li , @xmath1c and the @xmath0-elements could be expected .",
    "as discussed in detail above , the increase in ti and cr abundances presents a problem when interpreting the variations as reflecting nuclear processing .",
    "the most likely explanation for the observed changes in chemical composition of sakurai s object is thus the direct consequences of the mixing _ and _ nuclear reactions which has occurred following the he - shell flash : ingestion and burning of the h - rich envelope through ( interrupted ) cn - cycling , li production from the simultaneously ingested @xmath171he , and @xmath0-processing from neutrons liberated through @xmath3-captures on the available @xmath1c , which in turn has been produced from the concomitant proton captures on @xmath155c .",
    "in fact , the abundance alterations are in excellent accordance with theoretical expectations ( renzini 1990 ) , but the exact details how in particular the @xmath0-processing would have proceeded is less clear .",
    "however , we are presently not able to convincingly rule out the possibility that the @xmath0-elements have been synthesized in between previous he - shell flashes on the agb and are now being brought to the surface purely through dredge - up . such mixing though is not possible to invoke to explain the li - enrichment or all of the diminishing h - content , which requires current nucleosynthesis . in any way",
    ", the observed changes can only be understood if the final he - shell flash occurred _",
    "after _ the h - burning shell had been extinguished in the post - agb star , since otherwise the entropy barrier from h - burning would prevent ingestion of the h - rich envelope and no substantial mixing or nucleosynthesis besides he - burning would occur .",
    "the observed variations of ti and cr are , however , not easily explained within this framework .",
    "sakurai s object has evolved rapidly in effective temperature following discovery , as evident both from the spectroscopic analyses presented here for 1996 and from @xmath176 photometry ( duerbeck et al .",

    "[ f : c2 ] and [ f : h1 ] .",
    "this rapid cooling is the result of the stellar expansion caused by the drastically increased energy release after the final he - shell flash .",
    "a similar phenomenon is well - known to occur in novae in which the photosphere expands at roughly constant luminosity down to about 6000k , when the expanding shell becomes optically thin .",
    "we would thus expect the luminosity to have remained roughly constant during the expansion .    from @xmath176 monitoring of sakurai s object , duerbeck et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find evidence for a luminosity increase of about 30% .",
    "it is , however , not unlikely that this conclusion may be compromised by adoption of inappropriate bolometric corrections for the star ; considering the h - deficiency and its peculiar composition the line - blanketing will be very different compared with normal supergiants of similar temperatures .",
    "a constant luminosity can therefore in our opinion not be ruled out ; clearly more detailed calculations of bolometric corrections for the star are needed .",

    "fig.[f : param ] shows three loci of constant l in the log @xmath9 versus @xmath8 plane together with the derived values .",
    "when taken at face value , the spectroscopic parameters suggest an evolution with a decreasing luminosity ; however , the parameters are consistent with a constant luminosity and perhaps also with the modest increase suggested by duerbeck et al .",
    "( 1997 ) within the errors of measurement .",
    "spectroscopic estimates of luminosity are dependent on the assumption about the stellar mass but the primary uncertainty may arise from the basic assumptions underlying the construction of the model atmospheres . as pointed out by asplund et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium for the star may be inappropriate .",
    "in particular , an underestimation of the surface gravity will result from neglecting the hydrodynamics due to , for example , an overall atmospheric expansion or turbulent pressure ( gustafsson et al . 1975 ) . the assumption of constant luminosity and the observed decrease in @xmath8 require e.g. the expansion velocity to have _ increased _ during 1996 .",
    "this conclusion follows directly from the second derivative of the luminosity @xmath178 :    @xmath179    due to the linear decrease in @xmath8 with time in 1996 , @xmath180 and thus the expansion velocity must have increased : @xmath181 .",

    "( 1997 ) arrived at the same conclusion based on an analysis of photometric data .",
    "the observed trend of a decreasing @xmath10 also suggests that hydrostatic equilibrium may have been inapplicable directly following discovery .",
    "furthermore , for both april and may the spectroscopically derived parameters are located at the classical eddington luminosity for electron scattering ( asplund 1998 ) .",
    "thus , we can not at present rule out an evolution at constant luminosity from the spectroscopy .",
    "assuming a stellar mass of 0.8m@xmath167 ( see below ) , the spectroscopically derived parameters for october indicate a stellar luminosity of @xmath182l@xmath167 , which is in very good accordance with predictions for born - again giants ( iben & macdonald 1995 ; blcker & schnberner 1997 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of about 7kpc ( using the above - mentioned @xmath183 ) , which agrees with previously estimated distances of 5.5 - 8kpc ( duerbeck & benetti 1996 ; duerbeck et al .",

    "adopting the spectroscopic parameters of the earlier dates would require a larger distance .",
    "a distance of only 1.1kpc would imply log@xmath184 for october , a value well outside the acceptable uncertainties in the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the very rapid evolution of sakurai s object following discovery is significantly faster than for fgsge ( van genderen & gautschy 1995 ) though seemingly similar to that of v605aql though available data is scarce ( lundmark 1921 ; clayton & de marco 1997 ) .",
    "fgsge has throughout the last century brightened visually while cooling , while v605aql reached peak brightness within only two years , before starting to show rcrb - type fadings and turning too faint for followed monitoring ( seitter 1987 ) .",

    ", @xmath189 will be about 25years ( renzini 1990 ) , which is in good agreement with the only published numerical calculation of a final he - shell flash event by iben & macdonald ( 1995 ) , in which the subsequent brightening occurred over 17years furthermore , the theoretical time - scale is in agreement with the observed time - scale for h - burning in sakurai s object ( sect .",
    "[ s : abundchanges ] ) .",
    "different evolutionary time - scales are expected with different stellar masses @xmath190 , since @xmath187 is a very sensitive function of @xmath190 ( e.g. blcker & schnberner 1997 ) .",
    "the very rapid evolution of sakurai s object and v605aql can thus presumably be accomplished with a slightly higher @xmath190 and therefore smaller @xmath187 .",
    "the main difference in evolutionary time - scales between fgsge on one hand and sakurai s object and v605aql on the other is therefore probably due to different @xmath190 .",
    "the life - time of the quiescent born - again giant phase may be about a factor of 40 longer than @xmath189 , since the generated energy will be radiated away at a luminosity not very different from @xmath188 ( renzini 1990 ) . in reality , the life - time will be shorter since ( 1 ) the star can be found only part of the time in the giant regime and ( 2 ) due to the effects of mass - loss .",
    "typical life - time as a bright giant of 100 - 1000years can thus be expected , which is not incompatible with the observational evidence ; the visual brightness of v605aql has decreased greatly since outburst in 1919 but the bolometric luminosity has probably remained roughly the same ( harrison 1996 ; clayton & de marco 1997 ) . judging from their similarities in rise - time and visual variability at peak brightness , it is not a bold speculation that sakurai s object will soon also form an optically thick surrounding dust cloud , which will cause a visual fading it may not recover from ; the development of an ir excess ( eyres et al .",
    "1998 ) is certainly suggestive of such a prospect .",
    "the very rapid brightening of v605aql ( and now sakurai s object ) may perhaps have endowed a dynamical ejection of the outer envelope ( asplund 1998 ) which subsequently underwent dust condensation , while the more gentle brightening of fgsge did not provide the necessary conditions for formation of a completely obscuring dust shell but only the irregular dust condensations typical of rcrb stars .",
    "sakurai s object bears several striking similarities with the rcrb stars ( asplund et al . 1997b ; lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) , in particular with the rcrb star v854cen ( asplund et al . 1998 ) ; from an abundance perspective sakurai s object can be classified as an rcrb star . recently",
    ", sakurai s object has also been reported to show visual variability ( liller et al . 1998 ) : in february 1998 the star had faded by almost two magnitudes which by april it had recovered from , a behaviour characteristic of the rcrb stars .",
    "the irregular variability has since then continued ( h. duerbeck , private communication ) .",
    "thus , sakurai s object fulfills the two defining properties of the rcrb stars : a distinct h - deficiency and unpredictable visual dimming events , presumably due to dust formation episodes in the vicinity of the stars . for the first time , the `` birth '' of an rcrb star has therefore been witnessed , proving the `` final flash '' scenario ( renzini 1979 ) as a viable channel for the formation of rcrb stars , though perhaps not the only option .",
    "the rcrb stars can be put in two groups by chemical composition : a homogeneous majority class and a relatively heterogeneous minority class ( lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) , which are distinguished by a lower metallicity ( here : fe / c ) and several extreme abundance ratios , in particular [ si / fe ] and [ s / fe ] .",
    "sakurai s object , however , presently has traits of both groups .",
    "it is , therefore , not possible for the moment to identify which , if either , of the two rcrb groups evolved from a star experiencing a final flash .",
    "sakurai s object lacks the extreme [ si / fe ] and [ s / fe ] ratios of the minority , but has e.g. their low fe / c ratio and high [ na / fe ] ratio .",
    "furthermore , in no minority member has li previously been detected , which is a feature in four of the majority stars ( uwcen , rcrb , rznor and sutau ) .",
    "lithium , however , could conceivably be destroyed as sakurai s object continues to evolve .",
    "sakurai s object resembles most closely the rcrb star v854cen , whose status as a majority or minority member is also unclear ( asplund et al .",
    "the only property of sakurai s object not known to be shared with the rcrb stars is the high @xmath1c content ( asplund et al .",
    "possibly , the high @xmath1c abundance is a transient feature .",
    "it should be noted too that even rough estimates of the @xmath1c abundance are not available for most rcrb stars .    additional support for the final flash scenario comes from fgsge and v605aql .",
    "currently fgsge is showing typical rcrb - like variability ( papousek 1992 ) and there are hints that it may be h - deficient ( gonzalez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately the published abundance analyses ( e.g. kipper & kipper 1993 ; gonzalez et al . 1998 ) of fgsge differ significantly , even in [ x / fe ] , which prevents a detailed comparison with sakurai s object and the rcrb stars , in particular since a normal h - abundance has been assumed for the analyses .",
    "fgsge is , however , also significantly enhanced in the heavy @xmath0-elements and not only in the lighter @xmath0-elements , as is the case in sakurai s object . during outburst ,",
    "the spectrum of v605aql resembled closely those of cool rcrb stars ( lundmark 1921 ; ludendorff 1922 ; clayton & de marco 1997 ) , though detailed information on its chemical composition is lacking .",
    "the situation is therefore slightly unfortunate .",
    "all of the identified born - again giants sakurai s object , fgsge and v605aql show similarities with the rcrb stars , clearly suggesting the final flash scenario being a possible route to forming rcrb stars .",
    "however , none of the three stars are readily identified with neither the majority nor the minority group .",
    "it is tempting to tentatively identify at least the minority stars as descendants of a final flash , because of their more heterogeneous nature and their possibly higher c / he ratios ( asplund et al . 1997b ; asplund et al . 1998 ; lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) , which are in better agreement with theoretical predictions ( iben & macdonald 1995 ; schnberner 1996 ) . by applying occam s razor",
    ", one could speculate that _ all _ rcrb stars have indeed been formed through a final he - shell flash in a cooling pre - wd . until the abundance differences between the stars can be explained either by their earlier nucleosynthetic evolution or through the work of dust - gas separation ( lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) , this conclusion seems premature . here we , therefore , are happy to conclude that at least one rcrb star",
    " sakurai s object  is a final flash object . given the striking similarities in terms of chemical composition between v854cen and sakurai s object ( asplund et al .",

    "such a cooling is presumably the result of the expansion of the photosphere following the drastically increased luminosity due to the he - shell flash .",
    "even more spectacular , the chemical composition of sakurai s object shows definite signs of having been significantly altered within only a few months ( from april to october 1996 ) .",
    "again , these changes are most likely interpreted as being caused by the mixing and nuclear reactions which have ensued as a result of the final he - shell flash : ingestion and burning of the h - rich envelope , li - production through the cameron - fowler mechanism , and @xmath0-processing of the light @xmath0-elements ( including sc ) . to our knowledge",
    ", sakurai s object represents the fastest case of stellar evolution ever observed when disregarding complete stellar disruptions such as supernovae .",
    "sakurai s object shows strong abundance similarities with the rcrb stars , not only a distinct h - deficiency and c - enhancement . in all respects ,",
    "sakurai s object would be classified as an rcrb star judging from a compositional perspective ( lambert et al . 1998 ) . since sakurai s object also recently has started showing irregular fading episodes typical of the rcrb stars ( liller et al .",
    "1998 ) , sakurai s object indeed seem to have evolved into being an rcrb star . thus",
    ", for the first time ever , the `` birth '' of an rcrb star may have been witnessed , which lends strong support for the final flash scenario as a probable channel for forming at least some of the rcrb stars . the exact relation between sakurai s object and the majority and minority classes of the rcrb stars needs ,",
    "however , to be clarified before one draws any conclusions on how many of the rcrb stars have been formed through a final he - shell flash in a post - agb star on the wd cooling track .",
    "further studies of the future evolution of sakurai s object is clearly needed .",
    "judging from its rapid metamorphosis already since discovery in 1996 , it is not unlikely that the star will provide astronomers with even more surprises and spectacular changes of appearance in the years to come . in this respect ,",
    "both a close photometric monitoring of the visual variability and spectroscopic studies of the changes in chemical composition after 1996 are of great importance . the latter will , however , require a brave soul in order to analyse the terrifying richness of atomic and molecular lines , many of which are yet unidentified lines presumably due to @xmath0-elements . as long as the ir excess is not too disturbing ( eyres et al .",
    "1998 ) , it may be advantageous to use high - resolution near - ir spectrum for such abundance analyses .",
    "furthermore , we encourage studies on the chemical composition of fgsge , in particular regarding its h - content , and the rcrb star uaqr , which shows very pronounced @xmath0-element enhancements similar to fgsge and sakurai s object ( bond et al . 1979 ) , in order to assess better the relationship between born - again giants and the rcrb stars . finally and most urgently , the theoretical modelling of the final he - shell flash events needs to be extended to a range of stellar masses and initial conditions with a detailed study of the mixing processes and including the relevant nuclear reactions such as cno - cycling , he - burning , li - production and @xmath0-processing , which will likely provide strong constraints on the models .",
    "admittedly , such modelling is a herculean task considering the dynamical nature of the event , but is unfortunately required in order to fully understand the rapid evolution of sakurai s object and related stars .",
    "we are grateful to g. gonzalez , m. keane , v. klochkova and g. wallerstein for obtaining spectra of sakurai s object .",
