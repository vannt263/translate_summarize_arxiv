    "a full exploitation of this observational break - through at long wavelengths relies on the comparison with optical and near - infrared data for the identification of the counterparts of these sources , for the determination of their redshift and for investigating the nature of the source of the submillimeter / ir emission .",
    "a key question is whether the distant , dusty star ",
    "forming galaxies are recognizable from optical / near - ir data alone .",
    "heavily reddened sources can not be unambiguously identified by optical and near - ir colors : photometry of even the most extreme cases ( @xmath5 , eros , extremely red objects ) can not establish whether these objects are heavily reddened starbursts at high-@xmath6 ( graham & dey 1996 , cimatti et al .",
    "1998 , dey et al . 1999 ) or high redshift analogs of local elliptical galaxies ( spinrad et al .",
    "1997 , cohen et al . 1999 ,",
    "treu et al . 1999 ) .",
    "thus finding an optical _ spectroscopic signature able to pick out highly extincted galaxies would be extremely valuable , especially given the large number of spectra accessible from recent and near - future spectroscopic surveys .",
    "_    first evidence for the existence of such a signature has emerged from distant cluster studies .",
    "dressler et al . ( 1999 , d99 ) presented a spectroscopic catalog of cluster and field galaxies at @xmath7 and identified a class of spectra with strong balmer lines in absorption and [ oii ] in emission ( hereafter `` e(a ) '' galaxies , ew(@xmath8 @xmath9 and ew(oii@xmath10  ) , which was found to be abundant at intermediate redshifts both in the cluster and in the field environment ( about 10 % of the entire galactic population in d99 , see also poggianti et al .",
    "1999 , p99 ) .",
    "these authors also found a numerous _ cluster population of galaxies with strong balmer lines in absorption and no detectable emission ",
    "lines ( `` k+a / a+k '' class , ew(@xmath11  , traditionally named `` e+a '' galaxies ) , which are universally interpreted as post ",
    "starburst / post  starforming galaxies in which the star formation ended between a few myr and 1.5 gyr before the time of observation ( p99 ) . _    on the basis of dust  free models , the e(a ) spectra appear associated with _",
    "starburst galaxies with some residual star formation ( p99 ) .",
    "however , a search for similar spectra in the local universe ( p99 ) revealed that they are frequent among merging / strongly interacting galaxies ( 40 % in the sample of liu & kennicutt 1995a , b , lk95a , b ) , while they are scarce in normal field galaxy samples ( 87 % in the las campanas redshift survey and in kennicutt 1992a , b , k92a , b , see  5.1 for details ) .",
    "all of the e(a ) galaxies in lk95 are strong fir emitters and are known to be highly extincted starbursts . _    from the comparison of the distant e(a ) galaxies with their low-@xmath6 counterparts and the similarity of their spectral properties ( in particular , their low ew(oii)/ew(@xmath2 ) ratios ) , p99 concluded that the e(a ) galaxies are starbursts which contain a substantial amount of dust and suggested that they might be the progenitors of the abundant cluster population of post  starburst galaxies ( k+a / a+k ) .",
    "they also tentatively explained the e(a ) peculiar spectral properties as the result of `` selective '' dust extinction , which affects the youngest , most massive stars in hii regions much more than the older stellar populations responsible for the continuum flux .",
    "it is clear that if the e(a ) signature is proved to be unequivocally associated with highly extincted starbursts , then the identification of a strong @xmath1 line in emission ",
    "line spectra is a very powerful method to detect dusty  starforming galaxies up to high redshift . since in this case",
    "the sfr estimates based on optical data are unreliable , it is important to establish whether the detection of e(a ) spectra , besides revealing the _ presence and _ incidence of a starburst population , also allows to _ quantify the amount of star formation hidden by the dust and whether it provides definite informations about the properties and nature of these galaxies .",
    "these final issues could not be investigated on the basis of the d99 distant cluster sample , for which independent means of deriving the sfrs ( e.g. fir data ) are not available .",
    "hence a number of questions have remained open : _ _ _",
    "\\a ) are _ all the e(a ) spectra associated with dusty starbursts ?",
    "i.e. what is the range of fir luminosities of the e(a ) galaxies ? _",
    "\\b ) what fraction of the dusty starburst population display en e(a ) spectrum ?",
    "i.e. what is the proportion of e(a ) galaxies as a function of the fir luminosity ?",
    "\\c ) what are their typical star formation rates ?",
    "what percentage is hidden by dust ?",
    "\\d ) which star formation and dust properties / geometries are responsible for the e(a ) spectral characteristics ?",
    "\\e ) are e(a ) spectra always connected with merging galaxies , or are there other mechanisms that can produce them ?",
    "\\f ) what is the frequency of e(a ) galaxies as a function of redshift and environment ?    the goal of this paper is to investigate some of these issues by analysing the sample of very luminous infrared galaxies ( vlirgs , log(@xmath12 ) presented in wu et al .",
    "( 1998a , b w98a , b ) .",
    "this sample has a number of advantages for the purpose of our study : it is the largest , complete sample of vlirgs obtained to date , comprising a number of objects adequate for a statistical study .",
    "the wealth of information available for these galaxies ( emission  line luminosities over a wide spectral range , fir luminosities , merger stage / morphologies , reddening estimates ) makes it an excellent dataset for testing the connection between e(a ) spectra and dusty starbursts and for inspecting the properties of galaxies characterized by this type of spectra .",
    "the ultimate purpose of this analysis is to investigate the nature of the e(a ) galaxies in general and hopefully shed some light on the properties of the distant e(a ) s found in deep spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section we briefly present the spectroscopic catalog and we describe the line measurements and the spectral classification (  2.1 ) . in ",
    "3 we show the results of our spectral analysis and we examine the distributions of `` activity '' ( agn ) type of our spectral classes . in  4 we compare the spectral characteristics with other galactic properties ( fir luminosities , reddening estimates , morphologies ) in order to establish the typical dust obscuration , star formation rates and merger stage of the e(a ) population . in  5",
    "we review the incidence of e(a ) s in other spectroscopic surveys both at low and high redshift and in  6 we examine the possible physical scenarios accounting for the observed spectral properties (  6.1 ) .",
    "we then summarize our main conclusions in  7 .",
    "we assume @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper we will make use of the spectroscopic catalog of very luminous infrared galaxies obtained by w98a , b .",
    "w98a observed a complete sample ( 73 galaxies , hereafter the `` vlirg sample '' ) selected from the 2 jy redshift survey ( strauss et al .",
    "1992 ) with log(@xmath12 and sufficiently optically bright to obtain good s / n spectra .",
    "the 2 jy survey includes all the objects from the iras point source catalog with @xmath15 jy , @xmath16 ( a color criterion distinguishing galaxies from galactic objects ) and galactic latitude @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , spectra for 40 companions of vlirg galaxies and for 10 galaxies with slightly lower fir luminosity / fainter optical magnitudes were obtained ( w98a ) . in the following",
    "we will refer to the 40 companion galaxies as the `` companion sample '' and to the total sample ( vlirg+companion ) as the `` total w98 sample '' .",
    "most of these sources lie in the redshift range @xmath18 and have log(@xmath19 between 11.5 and 12 ( see w98a for the redshift and infrared luminosity distributions ) . for the purposes of this paper we have included into the vlirg sample 9 of the additional 10 galaxies with fainter / unknown optical magnitudes ( 6 objects ) or log(@xmath20 ( 3 objects ) , excluding only 1 galaxy significantly fainter in the fir ( 09517 + 6954 , log(@xmath21 ) .",
    "three companion and one vlirg spectra are too poor to determine their redshift / spectral class and have been disregarded in the analysis .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the 2.16 m telescope at the beijing astronomical observatory and cover the spectral range either 44007100 @xmath9 or 35008100 @xmath9 at a resolution of 11.2 and 9.3 @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the apertures were varied according to the redshift and correspond to the central 2 kpc for galaxies with @xmath22 , while for the most distant objects ( about 40 % of the sample ) a larger area is covered .",
    "in addition to the fir luminosities , and 100 @xmath23 fluxes ( @xmath24 10^{-14 } \\ , w \\ , m^{-2}$ ] ) .",
    "_ these are approximately total fir luminosities in the range 11000 @xmath23 .",
    "following the definition of `` total far  infrared emission '' given by helou et al.(1988 ) and adopting a standard correction factor 1.5 to convert the 42.5122.5 @xmath23 emission into a 11000 @xmath23 flux , the factors ( 1.75;2.55;1.01 ) in the formula above would be replaced by ( 1.89;2.58;1.00 ) .",

    "lines , the observed @xmath25 fluxes , the equivalent widths ( ews ) of @xmath26 and the intrinsic reddening estimates .",
    "we stress that , since many galaxies in the w98 sample are in pairs , multi  nuclei systems or groups , in some cases the task of identifying the component emitting the fir luminosity is problematic . for most galaxies",
    "the identification was done using the iras position and error ellipse , while for those sources with more than one companion in the error ellipse , the optical counterpart was found from the infrared colors or order of activity ( seyfert1 , seyfert2 , liner , hii ) ( w98b ) . for four of the sources",
    "( 08507 + 3520 , 13373 + 0105 , 13458 + 1540 , 13496 + 0221 ) it was impossible to determine which companion accounts for the fir emission and this has been assigned to each one of the components . for at least some of the sources ,",
    "the fir emission probably comes from two or even more companions , hence the discrimination between a vlirg and a companion galaxy can be somewhat arbitrary and the companion sample should not be regarded in any way as a `` low - fir luminosity '' sample .      in order to study the star formation and dust properties of these galaxies it is useful to classify their spectra into a number of classes .",
    "we adopt here a spectral classification scheme similar to the one presented in d99 .",
    "this scheme ( table 1 ) is based on two lines , [ oii]@xmath273727 in emission and @xmath1(@xmath28  ) in absorption , which are good indicators of ( respectively ) current and recent star formation in distant galaxy spectra .",
    "we measured the strength of these two lines and of the other main spectral features with two methods : using the package splot within the iraf environment ( comparing the results found with a gaussian fit and interactively choosing the line endpoints ) and using the same purpose  written software as in d99 .",
    "the two methods gave consistent results , and in the case of the @xmath29 blend our measurements are in good agreement with the values listed in w98a , b .",
    "since we wish to compare our results with those obtained by d99 , in the following we will use the values derived with their method .",
    "repeated measuments show that the typical uncertainty in the ews is @xmath30 for the weakest lines and a few per cent for the strongest ones .",

    "the stellar generations responsible for the strong @xmath1 line , with ages between a few @xmath101 and @xmath102 yrs ( poggianti & barbaro 1996 , 1997 ) , have had the time to drift away from ( or disperse ) the dusty molecular clouds where they were born ( calzetti et al .",

    "this scenario is to imagine that _ the extinction towards a star / stellar population decreases with the stellar age ( kinney , private communication ) : the effect of dust is maximum for the youngest generation of stars ( that provide the ionizing flux responsible for the emission lines , timescale @xmath106 few times @xmath101 yr ) , and decreases for older stars . in a sense , this scenario is equivalent to a `` clumpy distribution of dust '' where the location and thickness of the patches are not random , but depend on the age of the embedded stellar populations .",
    "the integrated emerging spectrum at wavelength @xmath27 is hence dominated by the less extincted ( older ) stars that are strong emitters at that @xmath27 , or that are indirectly responsible for the flux @xmath107 ( for example for the nebular emission ) .",
    "this happens because only the least obscured regions give the major contribution to the integrated spectrum ( witt et al . 1992 ) .",
    "_    an age - dependent obscuration is expected to mark in a peculiar way the spectrum of a dust - enshrouded starburst .",
    "if dust is absent , each given portion of a galactic spectrum is due to the stellar populations of a specific range of ages : for example , the emission lines are only observed if young stars with age @xmath108 yrs are present , while in a star - forming galaxy the u band light is influenced by stars of ages @xmath109 yrs .",
    "considering now the effects of dust , if each stellar age corresponds to a different amount of obscuration , _ within the same spectrum _ we expect to measure different values of extinction , depending on the spectral region / feature used to estimate it .",

    "we note that these results do not rule out a viable alternative producing e(a ) spectra , although no such case is known yet : a post - starburst galaxy with some residual star formation ( p99 ) . a systematic study of optically - selected e(a ) galaxies is required to establish the occurrence of this type of e(a ) s .    @xmath110 the median fir luminosity of e(a ) galaxies in our sample is log @xmath111 , but we stress that this should be regarded as an upper limit to the whole fir luminosity distribution of e(a ) s which needs to be determined from the analysis of spectroscopic catalogs including galaxies with log @xmath112 ( kim et al .",
    "1995 ) . while ultraluminous infrared galaxies can be found efficiently up to very high redshifts by scuba at sub ",
    "mm wavelengths , the e(a ) signature may help to identify less extreme , but more common dust - enshrouded galaxies and it appears to be essentially free from agn contamination .",
    "@xmath110 a universal property of the e(a ) spectra appears to be a low [ oii]/@xmath2 equivalent width ratio ; we find this to be due to a correspondingly low flux ratio , which is equal to 1/2 of the value observed in nearby spirals .",
    "we interpret this result as an effect of dust extinction , which is consistent with the average color excess e(b - v ) derived from the balmer decrement .",
    "we propose a scenario of _ selective dust obscuration that affects the youngest stellar populations more than the older stars and that can explain also the strong @xmath1 absorption lines observed . _",
    "@xmath110 the star formation rates derived from the fir luminosities of the e(a ) galaxies lie in the range 50 - 300 @xmath113 ; sfr estimates based on the @xmath2 ( and [ oii ] ) luminosities yields values a factor of 10 - 70 ( 20 - 140 ) lower .",
    "@xmath110 the incidence of mergers / strong interactions is very high in very luminous infrared galaxies of any spectral class and the only notable difference among the classes is a higher proportion of e(c ) galaxies with no obvious sign of interaction with a companion , which could be either advanced mergers or truly isolated objects . about 75% of our e(a ) galaxies are mergers / interacting pairs with close companions .",
    "@xmath110 a significant population of e(a ) galaxies has been found by deep optical spectroscopic surveys both in the cluster and the field environment at @xmath7 ( d99 , p99 , h97 ) . in the low-@xmath6 universe , a systematic census of e(a ) s is needed in order to assess the amount of evolution as a function of redshift and environment .",
    "we wish to thank c. liu and r. kennicutt for providing us their spectrophotometric atlas of merging galaxies and we acknowledge the availability of the kennicutt s ( 1992a ) atlas of galaxies from the ndss - dca astronomical data center .",
