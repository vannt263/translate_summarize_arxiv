    "the quest whether anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are both manisfestations of isolated neutron stars with ultra - strong magnetic fields ( @xmath4 @xmath6 g ) , so - called  magnetars \" @xcite , has recently been decided .",
    "notably , the first detection of sgr - like bursts from the direction of axp 1e 1048.1 - 5937 @xcite , followed by the detection of sgr - like bursts from axp 1e 2259 + 586 @xcite conclusively unified axps and sgrs ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed that the originally classical sgr 0526 - 66 was recently found to behave like an axp .",
    "this was predicted uniquely by the magnetar model @xcite . for recent reviews on axps and sgrs",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present detailed timing and spectral characteristics of axp 1e  1841 - 045 , located in the centre of the supernova remnant ( snr ) kes 73 ( g27.4 + 0.0 ) , which is at a kinematic distance between 6 and 7.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "the x - ray pulsations of the source were discovered with asca @xcite and a phase - connected timing solution was published by @xcite , who analyzed observations with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) spanning 2 years .",
    "a linear ephemeris appeared to be consistent with the pulse periods measured over 15 years with ginga , asca , rxte and bepposax .",

    "@xcite reported detailed results for 1e  1841 - 045  from chandra acis cc - mode observations .",
    "they could for the first time discriminate the compact object from the surrounding snr kes 73 .",
    "like other axps , the phase integrated spectrum ( pulsed and dc emission ) was well fitted with a power law ( photon index 2.0 @xmath7 0.3 ) plus blackbody model ( kt@xmath8= 0.44 @xmath7 0.02 kev ) .",
    "the photon index is the flattest among axps .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a two - blackbody fit rendered a similarly good fit .",
    "they also reported that the pulse profile is double - peaked , with the second pulse exhibiting a harder spectrum between 3 and 7 kev .",
    "@xcite published recently a source catalog of 28 sources detected by integral / ibis between 18 and 60 kev in a survey of the sagittarius arm tangent region .",
    "the source in this catalog with the hardest spectrum was identified with 1e  1841 - 045   and snr kes 73 . since axps are  known \" to be soft - spectrum sources , the snr seemed at first glance the most likely counterpart .",
    "this identification stimulated us to analyse archival rxte pca and hexte data to search for a pulsed signature from 1e  1841 - 045 , particularly in the hard x - ray range covered by hexte .",
    "we also analyzed archival xmm - newton data in an attempt to unravel the contributions from kes 73 and the pulsed and unpulsed emissions from 1e  1841 - 045 , combining the informations from our rxte pca / hexte and xmm - newton analyses , and the chandra results on 1e  1841 - 045  published by @xcite .",
    "in this study the results come mainly from the analysis of data from two of the three x - ray instruments aboard rxte , the proportional counter array ( pca ; 2 - 60 kev ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; 15 - 250 kev ) . both are non - imaging instruments .",

    "the energy resolution is about 18% at 6 kev .    the hexte instrument @xcite consists of two independent detectors clusters , each containing four na(tl)/csi(na ) scintillation detectors .",

    "because we are mainly interested in the medium / hard x - ray timing properties of 1e  1841 - 045  we ignored the events triggered in the propane layers of each pcu .",
    "furthermore , we used only data from the top xenon layers of each pcu in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "because the number of active pcus at any time was changing we treated the five pcus constituting the pca separately .",
    "for each pcu good time intervals have been determined by including only time periods when the pcu in question is on and during which the pointing direction is within @xmath16 from the target , the elevation angle above earth s horizon is greater than @xmath17 , a time delay of 30 minutes since the peak of a south - atlantic - anomaly passage holds , and a low background level from contaminating electrons is observed .",
    "these good time intervals have subsequently been applied in the screening process to the data streams from each of the pcus ( e.g. see table [ obs_table ] for the resulting screened exposure of pcu-2 per observation run ) .",
    "next , for each sub - observation the arrival times of the selected events ( for each pcu unit ) have been converted to arrival times at the solar system barycenter ( in tdb time scale ) using the instantaneous spacecraft position and celestial position of 1e  1841 - 045   ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these barycentered arrival times have been folded with the phase connected timing solution given in @xcite using only the first three frequency coefficients to obtain pulse phase distributions for selected energy windows .",
    "combining now the phase distributions from the various pcus the well - known 2 - 10 kev profile of 1e  1841 - 045   ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be recognized in each sub - observation , however , phase shifts between the sub - observations made a direct combination impossible .",
    "therefore we correlated the pulse phase distribution of each sub - observation with a chosen initial template and applied the measured phase shifts to obtain an aligned combination with much higher statistics .",
    "the correlation is then once repeated with , instead of the initially chosen template , the aligned combination from the first correlation to obtain the final summed profile ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a similar iterative method applied for psr b0540 - 69 ) .",

    "this result motivated us to search also the higher - energy hexte data for a pulsar signal .    .",
    "hexte operated in its default rocking mode during the observations listed in table [ obs_table ] allowing the collection of real - time background data from two independent positions @xmath22 to either side of the on - source position . for the timing analysis we selected only the on - source data .",
    "good time intervals have been determined using similar screening filters as used in the case of the pca .",
    "the selected on - source hexte event times have subsequently been barycentered and folded according to the ephemeris given in @xcite using again only the first three frequency coefficients . applying the phase shifts as derived from the contemporaneous pca measurements to the hexte phase distributions of each sub - observation",
    "we could obtain the hexte pulse phase distributions in 256 spectral channels for the combination of observations listed in table [ obs_table ] .",
    "the hexte integral ( @xmath23 kev ) pulse profile deviates from uniformity at a @xmath24 level and shows strong similarities with the pca profile for energies above @xmath25 kev .",
    "most remarkably , the pulse profile for energies greater than 50.3 kev reaches a significance of @xmath26 , proving the existence of pulsed emission from 1e  1841 - 045  at hard x - rays/ soft @xmath0-rays ( see fig .",

    "furthermore , the structured broad profile , measured with high statistics in the pca data , seems to behave as two components (  pulses \" ) separated @xmath30 in phase , with the relative contributions varying with energy . the first  pulse \" near phase 0.1 is dominant over the second  pulse \" near phase 0.5 for energies below @xmath31 kev . above this energy the second pulse , however , has a similar intensity level as the first pulse .",

    "we checked that the spectrum is not affected by pile up . to produce a background spectrum we selected an area near the supernova remnant , but sufficiently far from it to avoid contamination from the supernova itself .",
    "next we produced an energy response matrix and an ancilliary response file , the latter properly weighted using the surface brightness distribution of the extended emission of the source over the detector .",
    "we rebinned the spectrum such that we had about 3 bins per resolution element . since the source is relatively bright , with this rebinning we obtained at least 25 counts per bin in the range 0.3  7 kev , and at least 16 counts per bin up to 11 kev .",

    "such hard , non - thermal emission can only originate within the magnetosphere of a neutron star / magnetar .",
    "in fact , the total pulsed x - ray spectrum of 1e  1841 - 045  is very reminiscent to that of young spin - down powered pulsars .",

    "such hard x - ray emission from axps has hardly been considered in the modelling of axps . however , @xcite studied the production of high - energy gamma - ray radiation in the outer magnetospheres of axps .",
    "they argue that due to the strong field of a magnetar , the gamma - ray emission rooted at the polar caps will be quenched .",
    "however , far away from the pulsar surface , i.e. in the outer gaps , the gamma - rays could be emitted because the local magnetic field will drop below the critical quantum limit .",
    "the production process would be curvature radiation by the acceleration of electrons / positrons , resulting from the collisions between high - energy photons from the outer gap and the soft x - rays originating from the stellar surface .",
    "they applied their model calculations also to the case of 1e  1841 - 045 , and predict an integral gamma - ray photon flux for energies above 100 mev of @xmath4 8.7 @xmath50 10@xmath51 ( d/6 kpc)@xmath52 cm@xmath52 s@xmath54 , which is below the egret sensitivity but above the sensitivity of glast .",
    "the very - hard pulsed spectrum we measured with hexte might be consistent with this interpretation .",
    "we studied the energy dependence of the pulse profile morphology and confirm the findings by @xcite , namely the pulse profile is double - peaked , and the second pulse has a harder spectrum for energies below @xmath4 7 kev .",
    "however , this trend does not continue above @xmath25 kev . within the statistics ,",
    "both pulses remain visible at about the same strengths up to @xmath4 150 kev .",
    "significant variations with energy of pulse profile morphologies below @xmath2 kev have been reported earlier for three other axps ( 4u 0142 + 61 , 1rxs 1708 - 4009 and 1e 2259.1 + 586 ) by @xcite .",

    "in addition to the total pulsed spectrum ( pca / hexte ) and the pulsed+dc+kes-73 spectrum ( xmm epic pn / hexte ) derived in this work , we show the integral ibis isgri flux values for energies 18120 kev @xcite , and the chandra acis spectrum @xcite for the pulsed+dc spectrum of 1e  1841 - 045 . we note that the integral flux points are consistent with our total hexte spectrum ( one should realize that these preliminary integral ibis isgri flux values have still systematic uncertainties of @xmath4 10% ) .    for energies up to about 7 kev we have information on the relative contributions : 1 ) the pulsed fraction of 1e  1841 - 045  is @xmath4 25% ,",
    "2 ) there is very little margin for emission from snr kes 73 around 7 kev .",
    "this suggests that the hexte spectrum above 10 kev is dominated by emission from 1e  1841 - 045  ( pulsed+dc ) , and above @xmath55 kev the spectrum is totally due to pulsed emission .",
    "this would mean that also the dc emission from 1e  1841 - 045  extends up to @xmath55 kev !",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the relative contribution from kes 73 increases again above 10 kev due to a new hard component .",

    "if we assume that the contribution from kes 73 is small or negligible above 10 kev , the challenge is now to explain the hard dc emission from 1e  1841 - 045 .",
    "most plausible might be an origin in the magnetosphere , namely for the situation that the pulsed emission is  on \" for all phases . in the competing polar cap and outer gap ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) scenarios explaining the high - energy emission from spin - down powered pulsars there are geometries for which this is indeed possible . allowing for a small contribution from kes 73 , e.g. up to about 30 kev , and knowing that pulsar spectra depend on pulse phase , detailed model calculations are required to investigate this interpretation further .",
