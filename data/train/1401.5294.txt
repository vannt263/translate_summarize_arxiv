    "in this paper we shall survey a particular class of problems , which we like to refer to as `` evolutionary equations '' ( to distinguish it from the class of explicit first order ordinary differential equations with operator coefficients predominantly considered under the heading of _ evolution equations _ ) .",
    "this problem class is spacious enough to include not only classical evolution equations but also partial differential algebraic systems , functional differential equations and integro - differential equations .",
    "indeed , by thinking of elliptic systems as time dependent , for example as constant with respect to time on the connected components of @xmath0 , they also can be embedded into this class .",
    "the setting is  in its present state ",
    "largely limited to a hilbert space framework . as a matter of convenience the discussion will indeed be set in a complex hilbert space framework . for the concept of monotonicity it is , however , more appropriate to consider complex hilbert spaces as real hilbert spaces , which can canonically be achieved by reducing scalar multiplication to real numbers and replacing the inner product by its real part .",
    "so , a binary relation @xmath1 in a complex hilbert space @xmath2 with inner product @xmath3 would be called strictly monotone if @xmath4 for all @xmath5 holds and @xmath6 is some positive real number . in case @xmath7 the relation @xmath1 would be called monotone .    the importance of strict monotonicity , which in the linear operator case reduces to strict positive definiteness in a real or complex hilbert space @xmath8 in the sense naturally induced by the classification of the corresponding quadratic form @xmath9 given by @xmath10 on its domain @xmath11 .",
    "so , if @xmath9 is non - negative ( mostly called positive semi - definite ) , positive definite , strictly positive definite , then the operator @xmath12 will be called non - negative ( usually called positive ) , positive definite , strictly positive definite , respectively . if @xmath8 is a complex hilbert space it follows that @xmath12 must be hermitean .",
    "note that we do _ not _ restrict the definition of non - negativity , positive definiteness , strict positive definiteness to hermitean or symmetric linear operators .",
    "] , is of course well - known from the elliptic case . by a suitable choice of space - time norm",
    "this key to solving elliptic partial differential equation problems also allows to establish well - posedness for dynamic problems in exactly the same fashion .",
    "the crucial point for this extension is the observation that the one dimensional derivative itself , acting as the time derivative @xmath13 ( on the full time line @xmath14 ) , can be realized as a maximal strictly positive definite operator in an appropriately exponentially weighted @xmath15-type hilbert space over the real time - line @xmath14 .",
    "it is in fact this strict positive definiteness of @xmath13 which opens access to the problem class we shall describe later .    indeed , _",
    "@xmath13 _ simply turns out to be a _",
    "normal _ operator with @xmath16 being just multiplication by a positive constant .",
    "moreover , this time - derivative @xmath13 is continuously invertible and , as a normal operator , admits a straightforwardly defined functional calculus , which can canonically be extended to operator - valued functions . indeed , since we have control over the positivity constant via the choice of the weight , the norm of @xmath17 can be made as small as wanted .",
    "this observation is the hilbert space analogue to the technical usage of the exponentially weighted sup - norm as introduced by d. morgenstern , @xcite , and allows for the convenient inclusion of a variety of perturbation terms .",
    "having established time - differentiation @xmath13 as a normal operator , we are led to consider evolutionary problems as operator equations in a space - time setting , rather than as an ordinary differential equation in a spatial function space .",
    "the space - time operator equation perspective implies to deal with sums of unbounded operators , which , however , in our particular context is  due to the limitation of remaining in a hilbert space setting and considering only sums , where one of the terms is a function of the normal operator @xmath13  not so deep an issue . for more general operator sums or for",
    "a banach space setting more sophisticated and powerful tools from the abstract theory of operator sums initiated by the influential papers by da prato and grisvard , @xcite , and brezis and haraux , @xcite , may have to be employed . in these papers",
    "operator sums @xmath18 typically occurring in the context of explicit first order differential equations in banach spaces are considered as applications of the abstract theory , compare also e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 , section 7 ) .",
    "the obvious overlap with the framework presented in this paper would be the hilbert space situation in the case @xmath19 .",
    "we shall , however , not pursue to explore how the strategies developed in this context may be expanded to include more complicated material laws , which indeed has been done extensively in the wake of these ideas , but rather stay with our limited problem class , which covers a variety of diverse problems in a highly unified setting .",
    "naturally the results available for specialized cases are likely to be stronger and more general .    for introductory purposes let us consider the typical linear case of such a space - time operator equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 are given data",
    ", @xmath12 is a  usually  purely spatial  prototypically _ _ skew - selfadjoint__note that in our canonical reference situation @xmath12 is _",
    "skew_-selfadjoint rather than selfadjoint and so we have @xmath22 for all @xmath23 and coercitivity of @xmath12 is out of the question . to make this concrete",
    ": let @xmath24 denote the weak @xmath25-derivative .",
    "then our paradigmatic reference example on this elementary level would be the transport operator @xmath26 rather than the heat conduction operator @xmath27 . ]  operator and the quantities @xmath28 are linked by a so - called material law @xmath29 solving such an equation would involve establishing the bounded invertibility of @xmath30 .",
    "as a matter of `` philosophy '' we shall think of the  here linear ",
    "material law operator @xmath31 as encoding the complexity of the physical material whereas @xmath12 is kept simple and usually only contains spatial derivatives .",
    "if @xmath31 commutes with @xmath13 we shall speak of an autonomous system , otherwise we say the system is non - autonomous .",
    "another  more peripheral  observation with regards to the classical problems of mathematical physics is that they are predominantly of first order not only with respect to the time derivative , which is assumed in the above , but frequently even in _ both _ the temporal and spatial derivatives . indeed ,",
    "acoustic waves , heat transport , visco - elastic and electro - magnetic waves etc .",
    "are governed by first order systems of partial differential operators , i.e. @xmath12 is a first order differential operator in spatial derivatives , which only after some elimination of unknowns turn into the more common second order equations , i.e. the wave equation for the pressure field , the heat equation for the temperature distribution , the visco - elastic wave equation for the displacement field and the vectorial wave equation for the electric ( or magnetic ) field .",
    "it is , however , only in the direct investigation of the first order system that , as we shall see , the unifying feature of monotonicity becomes easily visible .",
    "moreover , the first order formulation reveals that the spatial derivative operator @xmath12 is of a hamiltonian type structure and consequently , by imposing suitable boundary conditions , turn out  in the standard cases  to lead to skew - selfadjoint @xmath12 in a suitable hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "so , from this perspective there is also undoubtedly a flavor of the concept of _ symmetric hyperbolic systems _ as introduced by k. o. friedrichs , @xcite , and of petrovskii well - posedness , @xcite , at the roots of this approach .    for illustrational purposes let us consider from a purely heuristic point of view the @xmath32-dimensional system @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath24 is simply the weak @xmath25-derivative , compare footnote [ fn : paradigm ] .",
    "assuming @xmath35 , @xmath36 , in ( [ eq : ex - system ] ) clearly results in a ( symmetric ) hyperbolic system and eliminating the unknown @xmath37 yields the wave equation in the form @xmath38 for @xmath35,@xmath39 we obtain a differential algebraic system , which represents the parabolic case in the sense that after eliminating @xmath37 we obtain the heat equation @xmath40 finally , if both parameters vanish , we obtain a 1-dimensional elliptic system and as expected after eliminating the unknown @xmath37 a 1-dimensional elliptic equation for @xmath41 results : @xmath42 allowing now @xmath43 to be @xmath44-multiplication operators with values in @xmath45 , which would allow the resulting equations to jump in space between elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic `` material properties '' , could be a possible scenario we envision for our framework . as will become clear , the basic idea of this simple `` toy '' example can be carried over to general evolutionary equations .",
    "also in this connotation there are stronger and more general results for specialized cases .",
    "a problem of this flavor of `` degeneracy '' has been for example discussed for a non - autonomous , degenerate integro - differential equation of parabolic / elliptic type in @xcite .",
    "a prominent feature distinguishing general operator equations from those describing dynamic processes is the specific role of time , which is not just another space variable , but characterizes dynamic processes via the property of causality .",
    "requiring causality for the solution operator @xmath46 results in very specific types of material law operators @xmath31 , which are causal and compatible with causality of @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to deeper insights into the structural properties of mathematically viable models of physical phenomena .",
    "the solution theory can be extended canonically to temporal distributions with values in a hilbert space . in this perspective",
    "initial value problems , i.e. prescribing @xmath47 in ( [ eq : evo_1 ] ) , amount to allowing a source term @xmath21 of the form @xmath48 defined by @xmath49 for @xmath50 in the space @xmath51 of continuous @xmath2-valued functions with compact support .",
    "this source term encodes the classical initial condition @xmath52 . for the constant coefficient case  say ",
    "@xmath19 , it is a standard approach to establish the existence of a fundamental solution ( or more generally , e.g. in the non - autonomous case , a green s functions ) and to represent general solutions as convolution with the fundamental solution .",
    "this is of course nothing but a description of the continuous one - parameter semi - group approach .",
    "indeed , such a semi - group @xmath53 is , if extended by zero to the whole real time line , nothing but the fundamental solution @xmath54 with @xmath55-\\infty,0 \\right[}. \\end{cases}$ ] in the non - autonomous case , the role of @xmath56 is played by a so - called evolution family .",
    "the regularity properties of such fundamental solutions results in stronger regularity properties of the corresponding solutions .",
    "since we allow @xmath31 to be more general , constructing such fundamental solutions / green s functions is not always available or feasible .",
    "indeed , we shall focus for sake of simplicity on the case that the data @xmath21 do not contain such dirac type sources , which can be achieved simply by subtracting the initial data or by including distributional objects such as @xmath48 in the hilbert space structure via extension to extrapolation spaces , which for sake of simplicity we will not burden this presentation with .",
    "as a trade - off for our constraint , which in the simplest linear case would reduce our discussion to considering @xmath57 as a sum of commuting normal operators , which clearly can not support any claim of novelty , see e.g. @xcite , we obtain by allowing for a large class of material law operators @xmath31 access to a large variety of problems including such diverse topics as partial differential - algebraic systems , integro - differential equations and evolutionary equations of changing type in one unified setting .",
    "based on the linear theory one has of course a first access to non - linear problems by including lipschitz continuous perturbations .",
    "a different generalization towards a non - linear theory can be done by replacing the ( skew - selfadjoint ) operator @xmath12 by a maximal monotone relation or allowing for suitable maximal monotone material law relations ( rather than material law operators ) . in this way",
    "the class of evolutionary problems also comprises evolutionary _ _ inclusion__s .",
    "having established well - posedness , qualitative properties associated with the solution theory come into focus . a first step in this direction",
    "is done for the autonomous case by the discussion of the issue of `` exponential stability '' .",
    "one can give criteria with regards to the material law @xmath31 ensuring exponential stability .",
    "another aspect in connection with the discussion of partial differential equations of mathematical physics is the problem of continuous dependence of the solution on the coefficients .",
    "a main application of results in this direction is the theory of homogenization , i.e. , the study of the behavior of solutions of partial differential equations having large oscillatory coefficients .",
    "it is natural to discuss the weak operator topology for the coefficients and it turns out that the problem class under consideration is closed under limits in this topology if further suitable structural assumptions are imposed .",
    "the closedness of the problem class is a remarkable feature of the problem class , which is spacious enough to also include  hidden in the generality of the material law operator",
    " integro - differential evolutionary problems . in",
    "this regard it is worth recalling that there are examples already for ordinary differential equations , for which the resulting limit equations are of integro - differential type , showing that differential equations are in this respect a too small problem class .",
    "although links to the core concepts which have entered the described approach are too numerous to be recorded here to any appropriate extent , we shall try modestly to put them in a bibliographical context .",
    "the concept of the time - derivative considered as a continuously invertible operator in a suitably weighted hilbert space has its source in @xcite .",
    "it has been employed in obtaining a solution theory for evolutionary problems in the spirit described above only more recently , compare e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .",
    "general perspectives for well - posedness to partial differential equations via strict positive definiteness are of course at the heart of the theory of elliptic partial differential equations .",
    "for the theory of maximal monotone operators / relations , we refer to @xcite . for non - autonomous equations ,",
    "we refer to @xcite and  with a focus on maximal regularity  to @xcite .",
    "note that due to the generality of our approach , one can not expect maximal regularity of the solution operator in general .",
    "in fact , maximal regularity for the solution operator just means that the operator sum is already closed with its natural domain .",
    "this is rarely the case neither in the paradigmatic examples nor in our expanded general setting .    for results regarding exponential stability for a class of hyperbolic integro - differential equations , we refer to @xcite and to @xcite for the treatment of this issue in the context of one - parameter semi - groups .",
    "a detailed introduction to the theory of homogenization can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we also refer to @xcite , where homogenization for ordinary differential equations has been discussed extensively .",
    "the paper itself is structured as follows .",
    "we begin our presentation with a description of the underlying prerequisites , even to the extent that we review the celebrated well - posedness requirements due to hadamard , which we found inspirational for a deeper understanding of the case of differential inclusions . a main point in this first section",
    "is to introduce the classical concept of maximal strictly monotone relations and to recall that such relations are inverse relations of lipschitz continuous mappings ( minty s theorem [ thm : minty ] ) .",
    "specializing to the linear case we recall in particular the lax - milgram lemma ( corollary [ cor : lax - mil ] ) and as a by - product derive a variant of the classical solution theory for elliptic type equations .",
    "moreover , we comment on a general solution theory for ( non - linear ) elliptic type equations in divergence form relying only on the validity of a poincar type estimate ( theorem [ thm : sthe ] ) .",
    "we conclude this section with an example for an elliptic type equation with possible degeneracies in the coefficients as an application of the ideas presented .",
    "based on the first section s general findings , section [ sec : linear - evolutionary - equations ] deals with the solution theory for linear evolutionary equations . after collecting some guiding examples in subsection [ sub : leading - examples ] ,",
    "we rigorously establish in subsection [ sub : the - time - derivative ] the time - derivative as a strictly monotone , normal operator in a suitably weighted hilbert space . based on this and with resulting structural properties , such as a functional calculus , at hand , in subsection [ sub : evo_eq_auto ] ( theorem [ thm : sol_theo_skew ] ) we formulate a solution theory for autonomous , linear evolutionary equations .",
    "the subsequent examples review some of those mentioned in subsection [ sub : leading - examples ] in a rigorous functional analytic setting to illustrate the applicability of the solution theory . as further applications we show that theorem",
    "[ thm : sol_theo_skew ] also covers integro - differential equations ( theorem [ thm : integro ] ) and equations containing fractional time - derivatives ( theorem [ thm : frac ] ) .",
    "we conclude this subsection with a conceptual study of exponential stability ( definition [ def : exp_stab ] and theorem [ thm : criterion - stab ] ) in our theoretical context .    in subsection [ sub : the - closedness - of ] ,",
    "starting out with a short motivating introductory part concerning homogenization issues , we discuss the closedness of the problem class under the weak operator topology for the coefficients . a first theorem in this direction is then obtained as theorem [ thm : hom_1_auto_comp ] . after presenting some examples",
    ", we continue our investigation of homogenization problems first for ordinary differential equations ( theorems [ thm : ode_degen ] and [ thm : ode_non_degen ] )",
    ". then we formulate a general homogenization result ( theorem [ thm : hom_gen_inf_null ] ) , which is afterwards exemplified by considering maxwell s equations and in particular the so - called eddy current problem of electro - magnetic theory .    in subsection [ sub : the - non - autonomous - case ] we extend the solution theory to include the non - autonomous case . a first step in this direction",
    "is provided by theorem [ thm : solutiontheory ] , for which the illustrative example [ ex : illustrating_non_autp ] is given as an application .",
    "a common generalization of the theorems [ thm : sol_theo_skew ] and [ thm : solutiontheory ] is given in theorem [ thm : non - auto2 ] .",
    "this is followed by an adapted continuous dependence result theorem [ thm : general_cont_depend ] , which in particular is applicable to homogenization problems .",
    "a detailed example of a mixed type problem concludes this section .",
    "section [ sec : monotone - evolutionary - problems ] gives an account for a non - linear extension of the theory .",
    "similarly to the previous section , the results are considered in the autonomous case first ( subsection [ sub : incl_auto ] ) and then generalized to the non - autonomous case ( subsection [ sub : the - non - autonomous - case - incl ] ) .",
    "subsection [ sub : problems - with - non - linear - bdy ] concludes this section and the paper with a discussion of an application to evolutionary problems with non - linear boundary conditions .",
    "one of the guiding conceptual ideas here is to avoid regularity assumptions on the boundary of the underlying domain .",
    "this entails replacing the classical boundary trace type data spaces , by a suitable generalized analogue of @xmath58-harmonic functions .",
    "we exemplify our results with an impedance type problem for the wave equation and with the elasic equations with frictional boundary conditions .",
    "note that inner products , indeed all sesqui - linear forms , are  following the physicists habits  assumed to be conjugate - linear in the first component and linear in the second component .",
    "to begin with , let us recall the well - known hadamard requirements for well - posedness .",
    "it is appropriate for our purposes , however , to formulate them for the case of relations rather than  as usually done  for mappings .",
    "hadamard proposed to define what `` reasonably solvable '' should entail .",
    "solving a problem involves to establish a binary relation @xmath59 between `` data '' in a topological space @xmath60 and corresponding `` solutions '' in a topological space @xmath8 , which is designed to cover a chosen pool of examples to our satisfaction . finding a solution then means , given @xmath61 find @xmath62 such that @xmath63 . if we wish to supply a solution for all possible data , there are some natural requirements that the problem class @xmath64 should have to ensure that this task is reasonably conceived . to exclude cases of trivial failure to describe a solution theory for @xmath64 , we assume first that @xmath64 is already _ closed _ in @xmath65",
    ". then well - posedness in the spirit of hadamard requires the following three properties .    1 .",

    "( `` continuous dependence '' of the solution on the data ) the mapping @xmath66 is continuous .    in case of @xmath64 being a mapping",
    "then @xmath74p = p^{-1}\\left[y\\right]$ ] is the _ domain @xmath75 of @xmath64 .",
    "_ for our purposes here we shall assume that @xmath76 and that @xmath8 is a complex hilbert space .",
    "a very particular but convenient instance of well - posedness , which nevertheless appears to dominate in applications , is the maximal monotonicity of @xmath77 for some @xmath780,\\infty \\right[}$ ] .",
    "recall that a relation @xmath79 is called _ monotone _ if _ _",
    "@xmath80 for all @xmath81 .",
    "such a relation @xmath82 is called _ maximal _ if there exists no proper monotone extension in @xmath83 .",

    "then the inverse relation @xmath66 defines a lipschitz continuous mapping with domain @xmath89 and @xmath90 as possible lipschitz constant .",
    "we first note that the monotonicity of @xmath91 implies @xmath92 hence , if @xmath93 then @xmath94 must equal @xmath95 , i.e. the uniqueness requirement is satisfied , making @xmath96\\to x$ ] a well - defined mapping",

    "this is the part we will omit and refer to @xcite instead . to establish lipschitz continuity of @xmath98 we observe that @xmath99 holds , from which the desired continuity estimate follows .    for many problems ,",
    "the strict monotonicity is easy to obtain .",
    "the maximality , however , needs a deeper understanding of the operators involved . in the linear case , writing now @xmath12 for @xmath64 , there is a convenient set - up to establish maximality by noting that @xmath100a^{*}\\right)^{\\perp}=\\overline{a\\left[x\\right]}\\ ] ] according to the projection theorem .",

    "however , in order to apply perturbation results , which are the key tools for proving the well - posedness of ( [ eq : non_auto_incl ] ) , we need to impose this additional constraint ( compare ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.19 ) ) .",
