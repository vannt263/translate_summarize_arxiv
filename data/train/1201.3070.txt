    "nuclear fission is a field of very intense studies in the recent decade @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting characteristics of neutron - induced fission is the huge difference of the mass distribution of the fission fragments for different nuclei and the dramatic change of the mass distribution with the variation of the incident energies of neutron .",
    "it is still far from clear how the parent nucleus transforms into a variety of daughter pairs .",
    "the highly excited primary fission fragments , whose mass distributions are called pre - neutron emission mass distributions , are de - excited by the emission of prompt neutrons , and followed by prompt @xmath5-rays to form the primary fission products .",
    "the primary fission products are usually highly neutron - rich and unstable , and gradually evolve to the secondary fission products through the emission of delayed neutrons and the radioactive @xmath6-decay .",
    "we will focus on the study of the pre - neutron emission mass distribution of the primary fission fragments in this work .",
    "the precise calculation of the pre - neutron emission mass distributions is of great importance for understanding the fission process and for describing the yields of the fission products .",
    "the measured mass distribution of the fission fragments can be reasonably well reproduced with some empirical approaches or some systematical methods .",
    "et al_. had developed systematics of mass distributions for neutron - induced @xmath0u fission @xcite and of independent yields for neutron - induced @xmath2u fission @xcite .",
    "they also presented the evaluation data @xcite and the adjusted data @xcite for several actinides .",
    "katakura @xcite and wahl @xcite had fitted the experimental data for actinide nuclei with 3 to 7 gaussian functions .",
    "kibkalo s phenomenological model was designed to study the dependence of the mass distribution on the transferred angular momentum , and was later adapted for predictions of fission yields @xcite .",
    "a new systematics for fragment mass yields of target nuclei from th to bk at incident particle energies between 5 and 200 mev was developed by gorodisskiy _",
    "et al_. through independent fission modes @xcite .",
    "the mass distributions predicted with the systematical methods mentioned above are generally described by a series of gaussians , and the model parameters are obtained through fitting the experimental data .",
    "however , available experimental data for energy - dependent neutron - induced fission yields , especially the pre - neutron emission mass distributions , are not sufficient enough for the development of global systematics , which results in great difficulties for the predictions of the mass distributions at unmeasured energies .    for a microscopic description of the mass distribution of nuclear fission",
    ", the precise calculation of the potential energy surface seems to be required .",
    "unfortunately , the microscopic calculation of the potential energy surface of a fissile system is very complicated and time - consuming .",
    "some phenomenological approaches are still required for the quantitative description of the energy dependence of the mass distribution at present .",
    "it is known that the shell and pairing effects play a key role for the fission and quasi - fission process .",
    "it is found that the quasi - fission mass distribution in fusion reactions leading to the synthesis of super - heavy nuclei can be reasonably well described by the driving potential in the di - nuclear system ( dns ) model @xcite , since the shell effects of reaction system are effectively involved in the driving potential via the q - value of the system .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the mass distribution of a fissile system based on its driving potential .",
    "because the deformation effect of a nuclear system influences the process of fusion and fission @xcite , it is expected that the deformations of nuclei play a role for a reliable calculation of the corresponding driving potential .    in this work ,",
    "we attempt to propose a simplified fission potential with a few well - determined parameters for quantitatively describing the pre - neutron emission mass distributions of neutron - induced actinide fission , by combining the corresponding driving potential of the fissile system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the calculation of the driving potential of a fissile system . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the fission potential and its parameters . in sec .",

    "assuming that a compound nucleus separates into a pair of nuclei in the fission process , @xmath7 the corresponding q - value of the system can be expressed as , @xmath8 here , @xmath9 denotes the energy of a nuclear system with mass @xmath10 and charge @xmath11 . for a description of the potential energy surface of a fissile system around scission point , the dinuclear system ( dns ) concept",
    "may be used , omitting the excitation energies of the fission fragments for simplicity .",
    "according to the dns concept , each fission fragment at the scission point retains its individuality in the evolution of the dns .",
    "this is a consequence of the influence of the shell structure of the partner fragments since the collective kinetic energy of the fission fragments is low around the scission point .",
    "based on the dns concept , the driving potential of a fissile system is expressed as @xmath12 in this work .",

    "the open circles denote calculated driving potential with the deformations of nuclei being taken into account . here",
    ", the deformations of nuclei at their ground state are taken from the calculations of the finite range droplet model @xcite .",
    "we consider the tip - tip orientation and simultaneously consider the dynamical octupole deformation of fragments ( empirically set @xmath24 ) in the fission process around the scission point , since one obtains a lower coulomb barrier at the tip - tip orientation .",

    "for a more quantitative description of the mass distribution of primary fission fragments , we further propose an empirical fission potential considering the calculated driving potential .",
    "one expects that the pre - neutron emission mass distribution , i.e. , the mass dependence of the primary fission fragments are strongly dependent on a corresponding fission potential .",

    "according to the calculated driving potentials , we find that the valley for the mass number of heavy fragment locates @xmath32 for neutron - induced actinide fission in general .",

    "the total mass distributions of the binary fission fragments should be normalized to @xmath40 .",
