    "in this supplementary material we show how the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree for bosons ( mctdhb ) theory attacks time - dependent and static problems , and how the many - body theory boils down to the multi - orbital mean - field .",
    "these relations allow us to understand that the self - induced effective potentials @xmath79 introduced in the main manuscript at the mean - field level have the many - body origin behind .",
    "then we show how to analyze the many - body solutions at hand and demonstrate how a normal ( standard ) condensate is transforming to multi - hump fragmented state with an increase of the inter - particle repulsion .",
    "finally , we address the question whether it is possible to verify the predicted physics within presently available experimental setups .",
    "the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb ) is used to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation : @xmath80 here @xmath8 and @xmath81 is the generic many - body hamiltonian defined in the main text .",
    "the mctdhb _ ansatz _ for the many - body wave - function @xmath82 is taken as a linear combination of time - dependent permanents : @xmath83 where the summation runs over all possible configurations whose occupations @xmath84 preserve the total number of bosons @xmath3 .",
    "so , the fock state @xmath55 studied in the main text is one of the terms in this sum .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath85 and shapes of the orbitals @xmath86 are variational time - dependent parameters of the mctdhb method , determined by the time - dependent variational principle .    to solve a time - dependent problem means to specify an initial many - body state and to find how the many - body function evolves .",
    "the initial mctdhb many - body state is given by initial expansion coefficients @xmath87 and by initial shapes of the orbitals @xmath88 . to determine their evolution one has to solve the respective governing equations which we list below .",
    "the equations - of - motion for expansion coefficients @xmath85 read : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the hamiltonian matrix with elements @xmath91 .",

    "we are interested in static solutions , i.e. , in many - body eigenstates of the time - independent schrdinger equation . within the mctdhb theory",
    "they are obtained by propagating the mctdhb equations - of - motion in imaginary time .",
    "this procedure relaxes an initial state to an eigenstate , typically to the ground - state , and , thus , is called relaxation . to find many - body eigenstates of the time - independent schrdinger equation , i.e.",
    ", static solutions , one can boil down the full time - dependent mctdhb theory to its time - independent version  to multi - configurational hartree for bosons ( mchb ) method [ 27 ] . from mathematical point of view",
    "this is done by switching off all time - dependency in the respective equations of motion ( s1 , s2 ) .",
    "the equations - of - motion for the expansion coefficients eq .",
    "( s1 ) are reduced to standard diagonalization procedure : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the total energy corresponding to the eigenstate @xmath105 .",
    "the static version of the equations - of - motion ( s2 ) can be rewritten without projections : @xmath106 where @xmath107 are scaled lagrange multipliers introduced to ensure orthonormality of the orbitals ( fragments ) @xmath108 .",
    "the optimal shapes of the now time - independent orbitals @xmath108 , @xmath93 and optimal @xmath105 have to be determined by solving the coupled system of eqs .",
    "( s5 , s6 ) self - consistently .",
    "now our goal is to demonstrate how the full many - body mctdhb theory boils down to the multi - orbital ( best ) mean - field ( bmf ) . from formal mathematical point of view",
    "this reduction is reached by taking a single term ( permanent ) in the mctdhb ansatz eq .",
    "( s0 ) and putting all other to zero .",
    "physically it means that the many - body solution is assumed to be well - described by @xmath74 separated sub - clouds ( fragments ) carrying @xmath109 bosons .",
    "moreover , it also implies that there is no exchange of bosons between the fragments .",
    "the multi - orbital mean field ansatz reads : @xmath110 the mc(td)hb equations - of - motions for the expansion coefficients eqs .",
    "( s1 , s5 ) become redundant , because we have only a single expansion coefficient .",
    "all off - diagonal elements of @xmath96 and @xmath97 corresponding to the single - permanent state are zero , while the diagonal ones are known in advance @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "( s6 , s7 ) , they become time - independent functions : @xmath117 in the present study the mean - field physics dictates localization of the fragments @xmath108 , @xmath93 at different places of the trap potential ( see e.g. fig .  2 ) .",
    "it also means that the overlap between the different fragments is negligible .",
    "hence , contribution from @xmath118 terms in @xmath119 cases can be neglected , because the integral over two functions with zero overlap is zero .",
    "this fact helps us to derive from eqs .",
    "( s7 ) the mean - field equations for a two - fold fragmented system with well - isolated left and right fragments discussed in the main text . to facilitate a formal connection between external trapping potential @xmath4 and effective potentials",

    "the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree method has been successfully formulated [ s1 ] in terms of reduced one- and two - body densities and _ local _ potentials @xmath116 also for systems of mixed bosons , fermions as well as for mixture thereof .",
    "so , the proposed analysis of the multi - hump solutions in terms of _ local _ self - induced effective potentials @xmath79 is expected to be universal and can be applied to all many - body systems .",

    "the two left fragments are well separated from the right ones .",
    "the non - integer occupations of these right fragments indicate that the physics here is slightly beyond mean - field . indeed ,",
    "the sub - clouds forming these humps are not completely localized , i.e. , the respective natural orbitals have two - hump profiles and non - zero density between the humps .",
    "this means that there is an exchange / flow of the bosons between the fragments .",
    "summarizing , in this example the many - body ground state is four - fold fragmented .",
    "the phase information between two left fragments is completely lost because they are very - well separated .",
    "the two right - most fragments are not entirely isolated from each other and , therefore , can communicate .",

    "a perfect random phase distribution between the left fragments would contrast with a deformed phase distribution between the right sub - clouds .",

    "the structure of the four - fold fragmented ground state for the finite - range interaction with @xmath25 is discussed in more detail in fig .",
    "the corresponding system with contact interaction is a slightly depleted single - hump condensate @xmath145 .",

    "i.e. , @xmath142 the systems with contact interaction are essentially condensed and have single - hump densities .",
    "the condensed fraction of the system with n=108 bosons and @xmath25 is @xmath145 . for smaller @xmath6",
    "the condensed fractions are even larger .",
    "to observe the predicted effects the first necessary condition is that the length / range of the inter - particle interaction should be comparable with the length of trapping potentials .",
    "the second necessary condition is that the interaction should be strong enough .",
    "there are at least two generically different ultra - cold systems where one expects to observe the formation of few - hump fragmented ground states : the dipolar condensates made of atomic or molecular species with non - zero electric / magnetic moments and ultra - cold systems made of rydberg - dressed atoms [ 10 , 11 , s3 ]    let us first consider the dipolar condensates .",
    "the dipolar systems apart from the long - range dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) also posses a residual contact contribution , so , in this respect , the main obstacle in the preparation of a strongly interacting dipolar system is the contact term .",
    "however , luckily , the short- and long - range terms do originate to different physics and , hence , can be individually manipulated .",
    "it was proposed to use the famous feshbach - resonance technique to demolish the contribution of the short - range terms , providing thereby opportunity to study pure dipolar systems .",
    "the interaction between two polarized ( oriented ) dipoles reads : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the separation between the dipoles , @xmath151 defines their orientation and @xmath152 is the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction .",

    "@xmath162 is the length of the external harmonic trap of frequency @xmath163 associated with the size of the harmonic oscillator ground - state wave function , @xmath164  the mass of a trapped particle .",
    "this change of variables rescales the hamiltonian @xmath165 and respective kinetic energy @xmath166 , single - particle trapping potential @xmath167 , and , the inter - particle interaction @xmath168 here @xmath169 is the rescaled interaction strength [ s4 ] .",
    "the length scale ( range ) associated to the pure ddi is @xmath170 [ s4 ] . taking the values of magnetic moments",
    "@xmath171 for @xmath0 and @xmath172 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 one obtains the respective ddi length scales ( ranges ) : @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 . for these atoms",
    "a typical trap with @xmath176 would result in @xmath177 0.5- , i.e. , the length of this trap is few orders of magnitude larger then the @xmath178 .",
    "fortunately , with optical lattices one can create traps with much stronger confinement .",
    "for example , in recent experiments with cr reported in ref .",
    "[ s5 ] , the vibrational spacing in a lattice was about .",
    "this lattice confinement results in @xmath179 of the corresponding trap length and much better ratio @xmath180 .",
    "if a similar confinement could be created for dy and er atomic clouds , one would get : @xmath181 and @xmath182 correspondingly .",
    "hence , the necessary ratio between the lengths of the ddi and of the confinement potentials can be reached in modern experiments with dipolar dy and er becs in optical lattices .",
    "let us now verify how strong are the ddis in these systems .",
    "the lattice - induced trap rescales the inter - particle ddi interaction strengths @xmath169 and results in : @xmath183 for cr , @xmath184 for dy and @xmath185 for er .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall that the multi - fold fragmented states depicted in figs .",
    "s1,s2 were reached with @xmath186 .",
    "the electric ddi can , in principle , be realized with ultra - cold clouds ( bec ) of oriented molecules .",
    "according to ref .",
    "[ s4 ] the ddi length of polar molecules of mass 100 a.m.u with an electric dipole of 0.2 debye is @xmath187 .",
    "a lattice - induced trap would result in @xmath188 , so , formally , @xmath189 .",
    "the strength of the electric ddi in this trap is @xmath190 .",
    "a tighter trap would results in a shorter @xmath191 and stronger ddi .",
    "concluding , the predicted multi - fold fragmented states can , in principle , be observed within presently available technologies in dipolar ultra - cold atomic / molecular becs trapped in tight optical traps .",
    "let us now consider the opportunity to realize the predicted multi - hump muti - fold fragmented physics in rydberg - dressed systems .",
    "the off - resonant optical coupling of ground state atoms to highly excited rydberg states [ 10 , 11 ] allows to modify and control the shape and strength of effective two - body interactions .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that a small component of the rydberg state is admixed to the ground state of atoms , providing thereby an additional degree of manipulation of the interaction strength .",
    "the shape of the potential energy of the two many - electron atoms excited to a rydberg state depends very much on details of the electronic structure .",
    "the most common long - range behavior , however , is of a standard van der waals ( @xmath192 ) type with possible admixture of terms of other degrees , e.g. , a pure dipole interaction ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "these additional contributions are responsible for the tails of the interaction potentials .",

    "[ 10 , 11 ] in a two - body effective inter - particle potential : @xmath194 a change of variables @xmath195 allows us to rewrite it in the units of external confining potential @xmath162 as : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the rescaled interaction strength and @xmath198 . in the present study",
    "we have used a similar one - dimensional inter - particle interaction @xmath199 , see figs .",
    "1a,1d and figs .",
    "the strength @xmath6 of the inter - particle interaction depends on experimentally tunable parameters : @xmath200  a two - photon rabi frequency between the involved atomic levels , @xmath201  detunings of lasers with respect to the atomic transitions , and the external confinement @xmath163 .",
    "the  screening \" constant @xmath202 defines the critical distance , below which the interaction is constant , i.e. , originates to the blockade phenomenon [ s3 ] .",
    "this range depends on the detuning @xmath201 and on a pure spectroscopic @xmath203 coefficient governed by the electronic structure of the excited state , i.e. , it can be manipulated by a proper choice of an atomic rydberg level .",
    "what are the presently available / reachable experimental conditions for rydberg excitations ? in recent experiments ref .",
    "[ s6 ] with rb becs a few tens of rydberg atoms in a quasi-1d trap have been successfully detected .",
    "the reported blockade radii were between 5- while the radial dipole trap frequencies used were around resulting in radial dimension of order of 1- , i.e. , ratio @xmath204 .",
    "it means that the range of the interaction was larger then the the size of the trap in the transverse direction .",
    "the strength of the interaction of the dressed rydberg atoms is defined by @xmath205 ratio and can be tuned between 0.1- , implying that in a trap the corresponding dimensionless interaction strength @xmath197 can be @xmath206 1 - 100 .",
    "so , formally , the lengths / ranges and interaction strength needed to observe the predicted multi - hump muti - fold fragmented states are already reachable with ultra - cold  dressed \" rydberg atoms .    finally , the results discussed in this work have been nicely explained at the multi - orbital mean - field level in terms of self - induced effective barriers .",
    "this also implies that the underlying physics is defined not by a strong interaction strength @xmath6 between individual particles but , rather , by the @xmath207 interaction mean - field parameter ( also known as non - linearity ) .",

    "<S> we have arrived here at a microscopic , self - consistent picture of _ self - induced _ fragmentation which requires as a prerequisite localized sub - clouds , finite - range inter - particle repulsion and a trap of a finite length . </S>",
    "<S> the action of a finite - range repulsive inter - particle potential on a cloud produces an effective barrier . </S>",

    "<S> the superposition of these self - induced barriers and external trap results in a multi - well potential confining the fragmented system as a whole object .    </S>",
    "<S> the multi - hump structure of the density is driven by the fragmentation phenomenon which has been observed experimentally @xcite and is well - understood theoretically @xcite . from this perspective , variations of shapes of @xmath62 can modify the induced effective potentials and , thereby , the fragmentation in the following manner : a ) by decreasing range of the inter - particle repulsion we increase the overlap between the fragments which reduces the fragmentation and leads to the development of coherence between them @xcite ; b ) by increasing strength of the inter - particle repulsion and keeping its range fixed we increase the heights of the induced barriers which isolates the fragments and enhances fragmentation ; c ) by flattening the tails of the inter - particle interaction function one stimulates the overlap between the sub - clouds which melts the humps and blurs the fragmentation . </S>",

    "<S> a simple geometrical relation between the effective length of the trap @xmath35 and width / range @xmath16 of the finite - range part of the inter - particle interaction function defines the number @xmath74 of available humps(fragments ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath75 we have a system of non - interacting particles because irrespective to the shape and size of the trapped cloud , the created effective barrier is geometrically broader than the trap ( box ) itself . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath76 there is enough room for two fragments to be trapped by the self - induced effective barriers , to accommodate @xmath74 fragments the length of the trap should be @xmath77 , see e.g. fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .        </S>",
    "<S> the obtained geometrical picture of localized fragments and self - induced effective potentials is universal and can be applied to systems of bosons , fermions and distinguishable particles also at higher dimensions . in the left and right panels of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the physics behind is an interplay between classical </S>",
    "<S>  electrostatic \" repulsion which pushes the bosons from the trap center towards its edges , provoking thereby the formation of multi - hump structures in the density , and quantum mechanics which governs loss of inter - hump coherence , i.e. , fragmentation .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , for experimental verification of the predicted phenomena with ultra - cold systems one needs that ( i ) the range of inter - particle interaction should be comparable with the length of trapping potentials ; ( ii ) repulsive interaction should be strong enough . </S>",
