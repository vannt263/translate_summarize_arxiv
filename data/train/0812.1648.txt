    "triangular or skew - product maps of the square are maps @xmath0 ^ 2\\mapsto [ 0,1]^2 $ ] of the form @xmath1 .",
    "a familiar such example is the baker map , which expands the square horizontally by a factor of @xmath2 and squeezes it vertically by @xmath3 so as to preserve areas , and subsequently folds the two horizontal halves on top of one another , thus recovering the unit square .",

    "<S> , we consider the special class of time - reversal symmetric triangular maps which are diffeomorphically conjugated to maps that preserve the volume measure and show that this condition is necessary and sufficient for the invariant measure to have the product form . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec.cusp ] is devoted to a one - dimensional parameter class of time - reversal triangular maps which are generalizations of the one - dimensional cusp maps and establish key properties of their equilibrium states . </S>"
