    "entanglement plays an important role in current quantum information processing , such as quantum computation @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , controlled teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite , and quantum - state sharing @xcite . in the past ten years , a large number of experiments",
    "have been reported that quantum computation and quantum communication are more powerful in many aspects than their classical counterparts . in order to complete such quantum information processing protocols , the maximally entangled states are usually required . however , in a practical transmission and storage , the entanglement inevitably will contact with the environment , and the noise will make the entanglement degrade",
    ". generally speaking , the maximally entangled state such as bell state @xmath0 may become a mixed state .",
    "that is @xmath1 here @xmath2 .",
    "it also may become a partially entangled state @xmath3 , with @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) represents the horizontal ( vertical ) photon polarization .",
    "entanglement purification can distill a set of mixed entangled states into a subset of highly entangled states with local operation and classical communication @xcite .",
    "however , it can only improve the quality of the mixed state and can not get the maximally entangled state . on the other hand , entanglement concentration , which will be detailed can be used to convert the partially entangled pairs to the maximally entangled ones @xcite . in 1996 , bennett _ et al . _",
    "proposed the first entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) , named schmidt decomposition protocol . in their protocol",
    ", they use the collective measurements which are difficult to manipulate in experiment @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also proposed an ecp based on entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "but their protocol requires the collective bell - state measurement .",
    "moreover , they need to know the coefficients in order to reconstruct the same entangled states . in 2001 , zhao _ et al . _ and yamamoto _ et al . _",
    "proposed two similar ecps independently with polarization beam splitters ( pbss ) @xcite .",
    "they have simplified the schmidt projection method and adopted the parity check to substitute the original collective measurement . here",
    "we call it pbs1 protocol .",
    "this idea has been developed to reconstruct the ecp with cross - kerr nonlinearity , which can be used to construct the quantum nondemolition detectors ( qnd ) @xcite .",
    "here we call it qnd1 protocol .",
    "the current ecps have in common that , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite they need at least two copies of less - entangled ( or say partially entangled ) pairs initially .",
    "but after performing the protocols , at most one pair of maximally entangled state can be obtained , or both of each should be discarded , according to the measurement results by classical communication .",
    "local operation and classical communication can not be used to increase entanglement .",
    "therefor , these ecps are essentially the transformation of entanglement and the previous works of entanglement concentration are not optimal . actually , two copies of less - entangled pairs are not necessary . using one copy of less - entangled pair to distillate high quality entanglement has been proposed in continuous variables system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , opatrn _ et al .",
    "_ showed the improvement on teleportation of continuous variables by photon subtraction via conditional measurement . in 2008 , he and bergou proposed a general probabilistic approach for transforming a single copy of discrete entanglement state without classical communication @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe two single - photon - assisted ecps in which only one pair of less - entangled state and one single photon are required .",
    "the two ecps are focused on the practical discrete less - entangled photon pairs and they are implemented with linear optics and cross - kerr nonlinearity , respectively . comparing with current ecps ,",
    "the single - photon - assisted ecps are more economical . in the first ecp , with linear optics",
    ", it can reach the same success probability as the protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite , but requires only one pair of less - entangled state . in the second ecp , with the help of cross - kerr nonlinearity , it can be repeated to get a higher success probability .",
    "these advantages make the two protocols more feasible in practical applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we first explain the basic principle of single - photon - assisted ecp with linear optics .",
    "we call it pbs2 protocol . in sec.iii , we extend this protocol to the system of cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "we call it qnd2 protocol .",
    "we show that sophisticated single - photon detectors are not required and the discarded items in pbs2 protocol can also be reused to perform concentration .",
    "the higher success probability can be obtained than other protocols . in sec .",
    "iv , we first calculate the entanglement transformation efficiency , and then make a discussion and summary .",
    "the basic principle of our pbs2 protocol is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the less - entangled pair of photons emitted from @xmath7 are sent to alice and bob .",
    "the photon @xmath8 belongs to alice and @xmath9 belongs to bob .",
    "the initial photon pair is in the following unknown state : @xmath10 emits a single photon with the form of latexmath:[\\ ] ]     plotted against @xmath82 after performing each protocols @xmath39 times ( @xmath81 ) in qnd2 protocol . for numerical simulation",
    ", we let @xmath83 as a good approximation.,width=264 ]    in our protocol , we only need one pair of less - entangled state to perform the protocol .",
    "therefor , in pbs2 protocol , @xmath105 and in qnd2 protocol , @xmath106 the relationship between the coefficient @xmath82 and entanglement transformation efficiency is shown in fig.5 .",
    "it is shown that @xmath93 is also not a fixed value , but increases with the initial entanglement . in qnd2 protocol",
    ", @xmath93 can reach the max value 1 with @xmath100 , which means that the initial one is the maximally entangled state .",
    "but in traditional protocols @xcite , @xmath107 .",
    "we also calculate the limit of entanglement transformation efficiency of qnd2 protocol , by iterating the protocol @xmath39 ( @xmath81 ) times . @xmath108",
    "the @xmath109 means the entanglement of remained state after performing successful concentration in nth iteration .",
    "it is a maximally entangled state with @xmath110 .",
    "fig.6 shows the relationship between @xmath82 and transformation probability @xmath93 . obviously , @xmath93 is monotone increasing with the entanglement of the initial state , and can get the max value 1 when the initial state is maximally entangled one , as @xmath100 .    in this paper ,",
    "the basic elements for us to complete the task are the pbs and qnd .",
    "in fact , both of them act as the same role , that is parity check . in refs @xcite and @xcite , they also resort to pbs and qnd to perform the concentration .",
    "but in each step , they require two pairs of less - entangled states .",
    "our protocol shows that with only one pair of less - entangled state and a single photon , we can also achieve this task .",
    "this good feature makes these protocols have a higher entanglement transformation efficiency than others . in the processing of describing our concentration protocol ,",
    "we exploit entanglement source and single photon source . an idea single photon source should exactly emit one and only one photon when the device is triggered .",
    "however , no single photon source and entanglement source will be ideal . in current technology ,",
    "practical pulse generated by a source may contain no photons or multiple photons , with different probability .",
    "we denote @xmath111 as the probability of emitting @xmath112 photons .",
    "interestingly , @xmath113 means no photon and will not give rise to errors .",
    "it only decreases the success probability of the protocol . because only two photons can not satisfy the three - mode cases .",
    "however , @xmath114 will give rise to errors .",
    "for example , @xmath115 will lead both of the modes @xmath25 and @xmath26 contain one photon in fig.1 which is a success event in our protocol .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to make the probability of such events rather small . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was reported that a single photon source whose @xmath113 and @xmath116 are 14% and 0.08% respectively .",
    "current spontaneous parametric down - conversion entanglement source is analogy with the single photon source .",
    "it generates entangled pair with the form of @xcite @xmath117    the multi - photon items @xmath118 can also cause errors . in practical teleportation experiments ,",
    "the @xmath119 @xcite , and the errors of multi - photon items is negligible .    in sec.iii",
    ", we exploit cross - kerr nonlinearity to implement our protocol .",
    "although a lot of works have been studied in the area of cross - kerr nonlinearity @xcite , we should acknowledge that it is still a quite controversial assumption for a clean cross - kerr nonlinearity in the optical single - photon regime . in 2002 , kok _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out that the kerr phase shift is only @xmath120 in the optical single - photon regime @xcite . in 2003 , hofmann showed that with a single two - level atom in a one - sided cavity , a large phase - shift of @xmath121 can be achieved @xcite .",
    "gea - banacloche showed that large shifts via the giant kerr effect with single - photon wave packet is impossible in current technology @xcite .",
    "the results of previous works of shapiro and razavi are consistent with gea - banacloche @xcite .",
    "recently , he _",
    "_ discussed the feasibility of qnd relies on the compatibility of small phase shift with large coherent state amplitude .",
    "they developed a general theory of the iteration between continuous - mode photonic pulses and applied it to the case of single photon interacting with a coherent state .",
    "they showed that if the pulses can fully pass through each other and the unwanted transverse - mode effects can be suppressed , the high fidelities , nonzero conditional phases , and high photon numbers are compatible @xcite .",
    "recent research also showed that using weak measurement , it is possible to amplify a cross - kerr phase shift to an observable value , which is much larger than the intrinsic magnitude of the single - photon - level nonlinearity @xcite .    in summary , we present two different protocols for nonlocal entanglement concentration of partially entangled states .",
    "we exploit both pbs and cross - kerr nonlinearity to achieve the task .",
    "our protocols have several advantages : first , they do not need to know the exactly efficiency @xmath82 and @xmath122 of the less - entangled pairs .",
    "second , they also do not resort to the collective measurement .",
    "third , with qnd , it does not require the parties to adopt the sophisticated single - photon detectors , and it can be iterated to get a higher success probability .",
    "fourth , compared with the previous works , the most significant advantage is that in each step we only need one pair of less - entangled state .",
    "it provides our protocols to obtain more higher entanglement transformation efficiency than others .",
    "fifth , these protocols are more feasible for multi - photon ghz state concentration , because they greatly reduce the practical operations and simplify the complication of classical communication for each parties .",
    "all these advantages may make our protocols be more useful in practical applications .",
