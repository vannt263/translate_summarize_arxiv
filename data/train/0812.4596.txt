    "recently there has been considerable interest in planar systems which exhibit topological phases .",
    "these phases are characterized by topological field theories ( tqfts ) or corresponding conformal field theories ( cfts ) .",
    "it is of great interest to have a clear understanding of the edges of such systems , and of domain walls between regions in different phases . in fractional quantum hall systems ,",
    "where experimental support for the existence of a variety of topological phases is strongest , observations are almost entirely restricted to edge transport , and proposed devices for probing the topological order rely on interference of tunneling currents between edges @xcite . in such experiments",
    "the electron density is usually not constant throughout the sample and islands with different filling fractions form , separated by domain walls . in lattice models with several topological phases ,",
    "one may similarly induce phase boundaries by varying the local couplings . in this letter",
    ", we present a general method to determine the degrees of freedom of boundaries between topological phases and their relation to the bulk degrees of freedom , based on the condensation of bosonic quasiparticles in auxiliary layered systems .",
    "consider a medium in topological phase i supporting a single island in topological phase ii .",
    "a setup like this has been considered in experiments by camino et al .",
    "@xcite for the case where phase i is the fractional quantum hall state at filling fraction @xmath0 and phase ii the fqh state at @xmath1 .",
    "we plan to give a treatment of this situation and more generally , of the hierarchy states described in @xcite and @xcite in a separate publication @xcite . here , we describe how the topological symmetry breaking procedure of @xcite can be applied in such physical settings , and follow up with two different examples .",
    "these involve kitaev s spin model on the honeycomb lattice  @xcite and a domain wall between spin polarized and unpolarized non - abelian fractional quantum hall liquids  @xcite .",
    "one way to match two different phases on a boundary is by taking the tensor product of the two boundary cfts .",
    "this would correspond to the situation where the two phases are separated by a strip of vacuum . to describe more general interfaces , we consider the geometry sketched in figure [ fig : hallbars ] , where we started with two layers in phases i and iii , which we let partially overlap as indicated . in the middle section",
    "we have a two layer system .",
    "if we bring the layers close we may have some binding between degrees of freedom in i and iii .",
    "in particular , a bosonic composite of excitations from the two layers could occur , and consequently , a condensate of such bosons may form .",
    "this condensation will lead to a different phase for the middle region , which we denote by ii .",
    "this situation can be analysed with the tools we have developed in @xcite .",
    "let us assume we are given cfts or tqfts @xmath2 and @xmath3 describing phases i and iii , or even just the spectrum of topological sectors @xmath4 , the fusion rules and the topological spins @xmath5 for these phases ( the topological spins @xmath6 correspond to the fractional parts of the conformal weights @xmath7 ) .",
    "the topological sectors of the @xmath8 theory will be labeled by pairs @xmath9 of labels from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 theories .",
    "we can now proceed as follows .",
    "\\(i ) we can find out which bosonic sectors are possible in the @xmath8 theory .",
    "bosons always have @xmath10 and in the simple case of sectors with quantum dimension @xmath11 , this requirement is all that is needed .",
    "\\(ii ) we assume that a condensate forms in one or more of the bosonic channels and use our method @xcite to determine the topological spectrum and fusion rules of the condensed phase .",
    "we denote the residual theory by @xmath12 .",
    "sectors of the @xmath8 theory branch into according to branching rules of the form @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 are integer branching multiplicities .",
    "thus in the new phase , some sectors , or primary fields of the @xmath15 theory that we started off with may branch to the same unique @xmath12-sector and hence will be identified , while others may split into independent @xmath12-sectors .",
    "typically , sectors which are related by fusion with the condensed boson are identified , while sectors which are invariant under fusion with the condensed boson may split .",
    "the condensed sector itself always branches to the vacuum of the @xmath12-theory .",
    "we require that branching and fusion are compatible , i.e. they commute . as a result , branching conserves quantum dimensions .",
    "\\(iii ) while the @xmath12-theory is required to have good fusion rules , some @xmath12-sectors will not inherit well defined spin factors or conformal weights from the uncondensed theory , basically because they have nontrivial braiding interaction with the condensed excitation .",
    "the corresponding excitations will pull strings in the condensed medium and will be confined . in effect , this means that they are expelled from the bulk and can propagate only on the boundary of the condensed medium .",
    "\\(iv ) the @xmath12-sectors which do inherit well defined topological spins from the uncondensed theory survive in the bulk and define the theory @xmath16 , which is a tqft which describes the fusion and braiding of excitations of phase ii .",
    "we now have a clear picture of the situation before and after condensation . before condensation ,",
    "arbitrary excitations of the system could be labeled @xmath9 , with excitations in phases i resp .",
    "iii labeled @xmath17 and @xmath18 resp . ,  where @xmath19 denotes the vacuum , or topologically trivial sector .",
    "( we may use this notation even where the second layer is not present . ) after condensation , excitations in phases i and iii are labeled as before , but in the overlap region , we now have phase ii , with bulk excitations described by the unconfined @xmath12-sectors and boundary excitations described by the confined @xmath12-sectors .    using the fusion rules of the @xmath12-theory , we can understand all the kinematics of processes that may occur when excitations are moved toward or through the edges . the crucial insight here",
    "is that excitations in all parts of the system can be labeled by sectors of the @xmath12-theory . for the bulk and boundary of phase ii",
    "this is true by definition and for the bulk of phase i we can use the branching rules to obtain the possible @xmath12-sectors from the actual sectors @xmath17 .",
    "the situation is particularly simple if every sector of phase i branches to a unique @xmath12-sector .",
    "this happens under quite general circumstances , notably whenever the theory @xmath2 does not by itself have bosonic sectors .",
    "we can now classify all boundary processes that may occur .",
    "for example any @xmath2-particle that is identified with a non confined @xmath12-particle can pass through the phase boundary unnoticed and vice versa , while a @xmath2-particle that corresponds to a confined @xmath12-particle can not enter the region in phase ii .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath12-particles which are confined in phase ii but which can be obtained from a @xmath2 sector by branching can pass into the area in phase i after being driven out of phase ii , without leaving a trace on the boundary .",
    "hence the true boundary excitations are labeled by the confined @xmath12-sectors which do not correspond to @xmath2-sectors . for processes involving three or more excitations",
    ", we need to use the fusion rules of @xmath12 .",
    "any process allowed by these rules could in principle occur .",
    "for example , a @xmath2 particle corresponding to a confined @xmath12-sector @xmath20 could hit the phase boundary and split into a boundary excitation @xmath21 and a bulk excitation @xmath22 of phase ii , provided that @xmath23 according to the fusion rules of @xmath12 .",
    "the fusion rules of @xmath12 are valid throughout . for instance , if two particles in phase i have a definite joint fusion channel , then this should be preserved even if one of the particles is moved into the region in phase ii .",
    "in fact , the full topological state of this multi - phase system should be characterized by specifying the amplitudes for the @xmath12-fusion channels obtained on successive fusions of all the quasiparticles that are present .",
    "this yields fusion bases analogous to the standard fusion bases of the the topological hilbert spaces of systems described by a single tqft . clearly , to actually perform the fusions involved",
    ", it will usually be necessary to bring the quasiparticles from the bulk of phases i and ii to the boundary .",
    "there are many situations where these general ideas apply .",
    "in particular , coset models form a large class that can be analyzed in terms of bose condensates @xcite .",
    "the construction of these models closely parallels the construction of figure [ fig : hallbars ] , where phase i is a @xmath24 phase , phase iii is a @xmath25 phase with the opposite chirality and in the overlap region we obtain a phase with the topological order of the @xmath26 coset , after condensation of all available bosons .",
    "we continue with two concrete applications of a slightly different , but related type .",
    "kitaev s honeycomb model  @xcite is a model of spins living on the sites of a honeycomb lattice and interacting through nearest neighbor ising - like interactions .",
    "the model is exactly solvable and displays two types of phases : three equivalent gapped abelian topological phases with the same topological order as the @xmath27 toric code model and central charge @xmath28 , and a gapless phase , which becomes gapped when a zeeman term is added to the hamiltonian and then displays non - abelian topological order described by the ising tqft at @xmath29 .",
    "the abelian phase has four sectors with @xmath30 fusion rules and the ising model has the well known three sectors labeled @xmath19 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , with @xmath19 denoting the vacuum and with nontrivial fusion rules given by @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37    we wish to consider a situation with an island in the abelian phase surrounded by a medium in the ising phase . to achieve this",
    ", we start with a large disc in the ising phase ( phase i ) and imagine placing a small disk on top of it , which is in a suitable phase iii so that a bose condensate can form leaving the bulk of the small disc in the @xmath38 phase ( phase ii ) .",
    "not surprisingly one should use an opposite chirality ising model for the small phase iii disc and then condense the @xmath39 field .",
    "this example has been worked out in detail in section x of @xcite .",
    "condensation leads to the identifications @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , while the remaining field has to split : @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the t - algebra has @xmath45 sectors and one finds that it has @xmath46 fusion rules .",
    "the fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 will be confined because they can not be assigned a consistent conformal weight ( the corresponding identified @xmath49 fields have conformal weights that differ by @xmath50 ) .",
    "the unconfined fields @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 correspond precisely to the fields @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the @xmath38 given in table [ tab : ising ] .",
    "let us now look at the wall in between the phases .",
    "of the three unconfined fields that correspond to particle excitations in the interior bulk , the fermionic @xmath54 excitation can freely move out through the wall into the exterior region and the other two bulk excitations can not .",
    "this corresponds well to the results of @xcite where it was shown that free fermionic excitations occur throughout the phase diagram .",
    "the confined excitations are expelled from the interior .",
    "one , the @xmath47 excitation can move into the exterior region , while the other , the @xmath48 excitation is strictly confined to the wall .",
    "now consider a @xmath31 excitation hitting the boundary . from the @xmath12 theory s fusion rules",
    ", we see that @xmath57 .",
    "hence , the @xmath31-particle can split into a boundary excitation and either an @xmath58 or an @xmath59 type toric code excitation .",
    "this corresponds well with the results of @xcite , where @xmath31-like excitations were exhibited in the toric code using superpositions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 type excitations .",
    "pushing another @xmath31 particle through the phase boundary will allow the confined @xmath48 excitations to annihilate , yielding either @xmath51 or @xmath54 . if the two @xmath31 particles were pair created ( had trivial fusion channel ) , the two toric code particles that form must have fusion channel @xmath19 resp .",
    "@xmath60 , conserving overall @xmath12-charge .",
    "now we turn to the interface between the moore read ( mr ) pfaffian fractional quantum hall state at filling @xmath61 or @xmath62  @xcite and the non - abelian spin - singlet ( nass ) state of ardonne and schoutens at @xmath63 or @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "this was recently considered in @xcite .",
    "we will again realize it as single layer ",
    "two layer boundary .",
    "we concentrate on the non - abelian parts of the the mr and nass theories here and leave out the @xmath65 factors ( these can be put back in at any point ) . consider a disc with @xmath66 , corresponding to mr , with on top of that a smaller disc with @xmath67 .",
    "the latter cft is the minimal model with @xmath68 corresponding to a tri - critical ising model .",
    "we give the field content of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 theories in tables [ tab : ising ] and [ tab : m4 - 5 ] .",
    "for the @xmath70 fusion rules we refer to the literature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath72 current is the only bosonic channel in the @xmath73 model and we assume that it condenses . as this is a simple current it is straightforward to see what happens to the various fields in the model .",
    "this is shown in table  [ tab : walls ] .",
    "we start with @xmath74 fields . in the second row",
    "we indicate how @xmath75 of these fields become pairwise identified ( because they are equivalent modulo fusion with @xmath72 ) , and how the other two fields split .",
    "we are thus left with the @xmath76 fields of the t - theory , which form an associative fusion algebra .",
    "a detailed analysis of the arguments for this case shows that the fusion rules of the algebra are given by @xmath77 where the nontrivial @xmath27 element corresponds to the either the @xmath78 or the @xmath79 field .",
    "the @xmath12-fields that are not confined form the residual bulk theory ( phase ii ) and correspond to the fields of the nass state of @xcite , as we intended .",
    "their quantum dimensions and topological spins are given in table [ tab : nass ] ) .",
    "the twelve fields of the full t - theory describing the interface are listed at the top of table [ tab : walls ] .",
    "we also give their quantum dimensions , which are consistent with the fusion rules and with the decomposition of the original sectors .",
    "it is not possible to assign unambiguous conformal weights to the confined fields , and therefore there is no consistent braid group representation for the full t - theory .",
    "we recall ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that this is no problem , since the full t - theory has only a strictly one - dimensional interpretation .",
    "it is now interesting to look more closely at the properties at the walls between the phases . in table",
    "[ tab : walls ] we have explicitly indicated the fields in the different possible interior and exterior regions , as well as those being strictly confined to particular walls , where the latter explicitly depend on what wall we are talking about . more precisely , we give the fields that extend from the wall into the exterior mr ( phase i ) region in the fourth row and the fields that extend from the wall into the interior nass ( phase ii ) region in the fifth row , and we have to conclude that the three remaining fields can only propagate in the wall .",
    "note that we also have to identify the @xmath81 field in the nass region , with the @xmath32 field in the mr region , which means that this field can propagate right through the wall .",
    "it is clear that the fusion rules of the t - theory fix the kinematically allowed channels in which particles which hit the wall , coming from either the interior or the exterior region , can split into particles in the other region plus a wall - excitation .",
    "for instance , from the t fusion rule @xmath82 , we find that if we start with a @xmath83 coming from the interior region , it can split into a @xmath31 going into the mr region and a @xmath84 staying in the wall .",
    "but since @xmath85 , it may also happen that the @xmath83 excitation splits into the two wall - excitations @xmath84 and @xmath86 .",
    "this scenario may also be turned around , two strict boundary excitations may fuse into a state that is not confined .",
    "obviously there is a myriad of possibilities and we refrain from listing them here .    a final comment concerns the relaxation of qubits near a wall @xcite .",
    "if we encode a topological qubit in the nass phase , for example in a pair of sigma particles ( which indeed span a two - dimensional hilbert space ) the qubit may relax to the lowest energy state by transferring a neutral excitation to the boundary . for a pair of @xmath87 fields we have the fusion rule @xmath88 , while @xmath89 = @xmath90 .",
    "each of these pairs can relax under emission of a @xmath91 excitation .",
    "a @xmath91 excitation may convert into one of the pairs @xmath92 , @xmath93 , or @xmath94 , which are all strictly confined to the interface .",
    "alternatively we may have @xmath95 where @xmath96 is confined to the wall but the @xmath31 can enter in the mr region ."
