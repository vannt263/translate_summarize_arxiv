    "nonequilibrium stationary states ( ness ) violate detailed balance , they can not be described as gibbs states , and their behavior shows a wealth of interesting phenomena that are absent in thermal equilibrium , such as boundary induced phase transitions , self organization , pattern formation , and long range spatial and temporal correlations .",
    "they occur in classical fluids @xcite , driven diffusive systems @xcite , granular flows @xcite and lattice gas cellular automata ( lgca ) with collision rules violating detailed balance @xcite , of which traffic models @xcite are simple examples . unfortunately , a general theory like gibbs statistical mechanics is lacking for ness , where results seem much less universal , and depend strongly on boundary conditions , driving forces , and the ( sequential or synchronous ) order in which the microscopic dynamics is applied @xcite .",
    "the standard theoretical approaches are based on langevin equations , fluctuating hydrodynamics , mode coupling theories , and ring kinetic theory , which are phenomenological and/or approximate in nature .",
    "a large amount of theoretical understanding has also been obtained from computer simulations as well .    however since 1992 new methods for obtaining exact solutions for simple open one - dimensional systems , the so - called asymmetric exclusion processes , have been developed based on transfer matrix methods ( bethe ansatz , matrix product ansatz @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "one can calculate bulk properties , phase diagrams , density profiles of boundary layers and interfaces between coexisting bulk phases , as well as spatial and temporal correlation functions .",
    "the number of exact results is rapidly growing . for an up to date list of references to analytic results for asymmetric exclusion processes",
    "we refer to the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "asymmetric exclusion processes can be characterized as open systems of interacting particles or random walkers on a lattice , in most cases linear chains , with hard core exclusion for double occupancy , and with hopping rates differing for different directions .",
    "the bulk dynamics may be deterministic or stochastic .",
    "open systems are coupled to reservoirs at both ends through stochastic boundaries .",
    "closed systems on a ring are coupled to local randomness such as defect sites @xcite or defect particles @xcite .",
    "applications range from shock waves in the burgers equation , to traffic flow problems , reaction - diffusion systems and growth models .",
    "the problem can be formulated in terms of master equations with discrete or continuous time @xcite , or in terms of the equivalent transfer matrices for spin chains @xcite , or as microdynamic equations , as is usually done in lgca , when used as models for nonequilibrium fluids @xcite .",
    "lgca represent perhaps also a more faithful representation of real traffic problems @xcite .",
    "the lgca approach will be followed in this paper .",
    "the dynamics of updating sites may be applied in ( random ) sequential order , typical for the master equation description , or in parallel , i.e. fully synchronous for all sites , typical for lgca , or in any intermediate version with strictly sequential or with sublattice ",
    "parallel updating @xcite .",
    "the different ways of updating are an essential part of the model .",
    "they affect the existence of different phases in the phase diagram , as well as the structure of the spatial and temporal correlations .",
    "for instance , the so - called maximum current phase is present in the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) with open boundaries , when updating is carried out in random sequential order @xcite , but is absent for other updating schemes @xcite .",
    "the spatial correlations are weakest for random sequential updating , intermediate for sequential and sublattice  parallel updatings , and strongest for parallel updating .    as far as analytic approaches are concerned many exact results about bulk properties , spatial and temporal correlations , and profiles are known for random sequential and sublattice ",
    "parallel updatings @xcite .",
    "the fully parallel updating schemes of lgca offer the largest difficulties , because the dynamics creates strong short range correlations , which invalidate simple mean field approaches .",
    "only some bulk properties like density , flux , and the phase diagram have been obtained @xcite , where ` in the bulk ' means `  outside the boundary layers ' .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is an analytic derivation of the correlation functions and the profiles , conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite for an open tasep with parallel updating , where the particles move forward fully synchronously at every time step with probability @xmath0 ( deterministic bulk dynamics ) if the site in front of them is empty , and where input and removal rates specify the stochastic boundary conditions . in ref .",
    "@xcite a much richer stochastic version of the same model with @xmath1 has been considered , and mean field results , based on a matrix multiplication ansatz , have been obtained .",
    "it includes the deterministic tasep , discussed in this paper , as a special case , and it also contains the maximal current phase , even in the case of fully synchronous updating .",
    "however , even with the highly sophisticated matrix multiplication ansatz , the profiles and correlation functions have not yet been calculated as the associated matrix algebra is quite complicated @xcite . in case of sequential or sublattice updating the model of ref .",
    "@xcite has already been generalized to include backward jumps with probability @xmath2 , and input and removal rates at both ends of the chain @xcite .",
    "our approach starts in section 2 from the _ microdynamic equations _",
    ", which describe the time evolution of the set of occupation numbers @xmath3 of the sites @xmath4 on the chain at time @xmath5 , as a discrete continuity equation , in which all variables are boolean variables , having only values 0 or 1 : @xmath6 here the instantaneous microscopic flux @xmath7 counts the number of particles passing through link @xmath8 at time @xmath9 .",
    "the influx @xmath10 and outflux @xmath11 specify the couplings to the stochastic reservoirs or blockage sites .",
    "further specification of the fluxes depends on the model , and will be given later .",
    "a detailed analysis of the microscopic evolution equation for sets of particle clusters @xmath12 , derived in section 3 , allows us not only to calculate the short range correlation functions that are built up through the dynamics , but also to identify the different phases , as well as the microscopic structure of boundary layers and the interface between different bulk phases . in section 4 the phase diagram , bulk densities and fluxes in the different phases",
    "are calculated .",
    "the phase diagram shows a phase transition from a free flow regime @xmath13 , where all particles are moving at maximum speed , to a congested or jammed regime @xmath14 , where the dynamics is controlled by start - stop waves . here",
    "@xmath15 is the input rate and @xmath16 the removal rate . when both rates are equal , there are coexisting phases with a sharp interface ( shock wave ) between them .",
    "the interpretation of the interface as a shock wave forms the direct link with burgers nonlinear diffusion equation @xcite .    in section 5 an exact hierarchy for particle - cluster correlation functions is derived , to which we apply our improved mean field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "it assumes for the low density phase , that _ inside the interface _ between bulk phase and boundary layer , the higher order correlations between on the one hand a particle - hole pair , and on the other hand the particle cluster directly in front of it , can be neglected .",
    "this is equivalent to neglecting certain 4-point correlation functions . for the high density phase",
    ", similar results are obtained through particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the mfa reduces the hierarchy to a set of recursion relations for the correlation functions and density profiles , which are solved in this section .",
    "knowledge of the density profile also enables us to calculate the average travel time of particles .",
    "the results are new , and are in excellent agreement with extensive computer simulations .",
    "the present mfa is similar in spirit , but not in specific details , to the improved mfa of ref .",
    "@xcite that accounts for short range 2-point correlations , but neglects higher order ones , and that leads to the solution of the tasep on a ring without a blockage .    to test the validity of our mfa",
    "we have applied the method in the appendix to the same open tasep , but now with sublattice  parallel updating , for which the exact correlations functions have been calculated in refs .",
    "it appears that the results agree with the exact results , apart from terms that are exponentially small in the length of the chain .",
    "moreover , it turns out that spatial correlations arising from parallel updating are quite different from those coming from sublattice ",
    "parallel updating .    in section 6",
    "we exploit the analogy that a blockage site on a ring has with on the one hand the entrance site and on the other hand with the exit site of the corresponding open system . in this way",
    "we recover the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the phase diagram , fluxes and the bulk densities for the tasep with a blockage on a ring with parallel updating .",
    "in addition we are able to construct the higher order correlation functions , density profiles and finite size corrections ( rounding ) of the @xmath17relation ( ` equation of state ' ) at the high and low density ends of the coexisting phase region .",
    "again , the results are new and in good agreement with computer simulations .",
    "we end in section 7 with some conclusions and suggestions .",
    "we consider a totally asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries as a lattice gas cellular automaton , with particles living on a one - dimensional lattice with sites labeled @xmath18 .",
    "the configuration of particles at time @xmath19 is described by the set of occupation numbers @xmath20 with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 if the site @xmath23 is occupied by a particle , and @xmath24 if the site is empty , i.e. is occupied by a hole ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the dynamics is defined such that all particles , which have an _ empty _",
    "nearest neighbor site in front of them at time @xmath5 , simultaneously jump to that site at the next time step ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "if that site is occupied , the particle does not move .",
    "so , the dynamics or updating in the bulk of the system is deterministic and fully parallel .    next , _ boundary conditions _ are specified .",
    "we consider an open system , coupled to two stochastic reservoirs , one that injects particles with a probability @xmath15 ( @xmath27 ) into site 1 , provided it is empty , and one that removes particles from site @xmath28 with probability @xmath16 ( @xmath29 ) provided site @xmath28 is occupied .",
    "if the system is in configuration @xmath30 at time @xmath5 , then , according to the dynamic rules described above , the configuration @xmath31 is given by the microdynamic equation @xmath32 with bulk and boundary fluxes given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 with @xmath35 represents a set of independent boolean variables , similar to @xmath36 and @xmath37 . ]",
    "@xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent a set of independent random boolean variables , which take the values @xmath41 with expectations @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and which are drawn at every time step from a uniform distribution . for later analysis",
    "it is convenient to transform the microdynamic equation ( [ a1])-([a3 ] ) to hole - occupation numbers @xmath44 , yielding @xmath45 the equations for the time evolution of averages @xmath46 , correlation functions @xmath47 etc .",
    "can be derived by multiplying the equations in ( [ a1 ] ) for different sites and subsequently averaging over arbitrary initial configurations @xmath48 . in this way",
    "one obtains an open hierarchy which couples the time changes of a correlations function to higher order ones .    for large times ( @xmath49 )",
    "the system will approach a non - equilibrium stationary state , which is the main focus of attention in this paper .",
    "averages over the ness are denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "this state is expected to be _ unique _ , i.e. independent of the initial configuration @xmath48 .",
    "therefore in analytical considerations the initial state is always taken to be the _ empty _ state @xmath51 for all @xmath23 ( @xmath52 , which is also the most relevant initial state in physical applications , such as traffic problems .",
    "a quantity of paramount interest is the average flux @xmath53 through the link ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 and the local flow velocity or average speed @xmath56 . in the ness these averages are independent of time , and",
    "the average flux can be calculated from the continuity equation , combined with ( [ a3 ] ) using the relation @xmath57 .",
    "this yields a constant site - independent flux through the system , @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "the flux in the ness is translationally invariant .",
    "once the nearest neighbor correlations are known , the density profile can be calculated from @xmath60 the equations of motion exhibit particle - hole symmetry , and the _ duality transformation _ , @xmath61 maps the microdynamic equation ( [ a1])-([a3 ] ) into the equivalent representation ( [ a2 ] ) , i.e. the microdynamic equation is invariant under particle - hole exchange .",
    "consequently , the average occupation numbers satisfy the symmetry relations @xmath62 with @xmath63 . as the flux maps @xmath64 under the duality transformation , the average flux satisfies the symmetry relation @xmath65",
    ". however , the average flux in the ness is constant for all sites , hence @xmath66 the particle - hole symmetry is a very powerful tool , as all properties for @xmath67 ( high density ) can be obtained from those for @xmath68 ( low density ) .",
    "in this section we show that a qualitative analysis of the microdynamic equation and the resulting instantaneous configurations leads already to the complete phase diagram , to an identification of the relevant order parameters , and to a qualitative characterization of the structure of the high and low density phase , as well as to the typical dynamics in the different phases .    in the sequel we will consider the dynamics of _ clusters _ of particles and holes described in terms of the boolean variables , @xmath69 with @xmath70 , i.e. a cluster has at least two constituents .",
    "the time evolution equations for these objects are obtained by multiplying ( [ a1 ] ) from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , using @xmath73 .",
    "the result is @xmath74 multiplication of both equations in ( [ a10 ] ) gives then @xmath75 where the relation @xmath76 has been used .",
    "the implications of ( [ a11 ] ) are quite interesting , as it states that a configuration containing ( @xmath77 ) _ can not _ be created .",
    "as all possible configurations have evolved from the empty initial state , configurations containing a cluster of particles _ tailing _ a cluster of holes do not exist in the ness .",
    "moreover , a configuration ( @xmath78 ) with a single particle - hole pair separating the two clusters can not be created either .",
    "the reason is that only the nonexistent configuration ( @xmath79 ) in the previous time step could have created the configuration under consideration .",
    "the question mark represents a `` 0 '' or a `` 1 '' .",
    "similarly a configuration ( @xmath80 ) with @xmath71 ( @xmath81 ) intermediate hole - particle pairs does not exist , as it could only have been created from the configuration ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "it then follows by complete induction that none of the above configurations can exist in the ness .",
    "consequently , the possible configurations generated by the dynamics from the empty initial state do not contain any configurations with two or more empty sites in front of the last cluster of particles .",
    "so , the fully parallel dynamics of the present tasep builds up very strong short range correlations in the ness .    from the observations about the build up of dynamic correlations , we arrive at some important conclusions about the structure of the ness . let @xmath83 label the position of the tail particle in the last particle cluster .",
    "the configurations in the interval @xmath84 $ ] consist of _ isolated _ particles , separated by an arbitrary number of holes . in these so called _ free flow _",
    "configurations @xmath85 i.e. there is a ` hard core repulsion ' between particles on _ nearest neighbor _ sites .",
    "the instantaneous fraction of occupied sites ( density ) in this interval is therefore @xmath86 .",
    "the configurations in the interval @xmath87 $ ] consist of _ isolated _ holes , separated by an arbitrary number of particles . in these so called _ jammed _ configurations @xmath88 i.e. there is a ` hard core repulsion ' between holes on nearest neighbor sites . the instantaneous density in this interval @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , _ large _",
    "systems with an overall density ( fraction of occupied sites ) @xmath90 necessarily have only bulk configurations of the free flow type with a narrow _ boundary layer _ of jammed configurations near the exit site of ( yet unknown ) width @xmath91 , whereas for @xmath92 bulk sites contain only jammed configurations with a narrow boundary layer of free flow configurations of width @xmath93 near the entrance site .",
    "which value of @xmath94 occurs , depends on the injection and removal rates , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and will be determined in section 4.1 .      to study the density profile we consider the dynamics of creation of pairs and larger clusters .",
    "we first observe that the first particle pair can only be created _ at _ the exit site and only if @xmath95 .",
    "this follows from the evolution equation ( [ a10 ] ) for @xmath96 which shows that creation of a new pair at ( @xmath97 ) requires the existence of a pair at ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "therefore , creation of the _ first _",
    "pair @xmath99 at @xmath26 is governed by @xmath100 where the term @xmath101 on the left hand side of the equation vanishes , as this pair has not yet been created .",
    "this implies that pairs can not be created if @xmath102 .",
    "consequently , there is no boundary layer near the exit , the density profile is totally _",
    "flat _ over the whole system and all configurations are pure free flow configurations .",
    "all space and time dependent correlations in this ness can be calculated exactly in a simple manner , as will be shown in section 5.2 .",
    "next we consider the case @xmath95 , where particle clusters can be created , at least near the exit site . in case",
    "the injection rate is smaller than the removal rate , the average interval between arrivals @xmath103 at the pile up region near the exit is larger than the average interval @xmath104 between removals , and a large fraction of configurations are pure free flow configurations without any clusters near the exit site . on average",
    "there is only a narrow boundary layer of jammed configurations .",
    "so , the bulk properties of the system in the low density case @xmath68 are determined by the injection rate @xmath15 at the entrance site .    in the jammed phase ( @xmath67 )",
    ", there is on average a large backup starting near the exit .",
    "the jammed configurations in the ness cover the bulk of the system , leaving only a narrow boundary layer with free flow configurations near the entrance .",
    "the bulk properties in the high density phase are determined by the removal rate @xmath16 at the exit site .    in case @xmath105 , there exist downstream free flow configurations and upstream jammed configurations , which occupy on average a finite fraction of the system .",
    "there are in fact two coexisting phases , spatially separated by an ` external driving field ' , imposed by the reservoirs with injection and removal rates @xmath105 .",
    "the phases are separated by an interface of microscopic size , containing only configurations with alternating particles and holes .",
    "these configurations , when present in a finite fraction of the system , would form the so called ` maximal current phase ' @xcite . in the present model",
    "the width of this interface diverges , i.e. attains a macroscopic width , only at a single point in the phase diagram , where @xmath106 ( see section 4.2 ) . in section 4.2",
    "we will return to the dynamics and the structure of the interface . in the phase diagram of the stochastic model of @xcite",
    "there is a line @xmath107 , where the density profile is _ flat _ over the whole system . in the present deterministic model @xmath108",
    "this corresponds to the line @xmath109 ( free flow phase ) , and to the line @xmath110 ( jammed phase ) .",
    "for large system size @xmath28 ( thermodynamic limit ) and @xmath68 the system is in the free flow phase , and the dynamics rigorously implies that the bulk of the system ( except the boundary layer near the exit ) has only _ isolated _ particles .",
    "so , this low density phase is characterized by an average density @xmath111 and has the _ vanishing _ order parameters @xmath112 for @xmath23 in the _ bulk _ phase , defined as @xmath113 with @xmath114 the width of the boundary layer near the exit .",
    "in fact , even the microscopic order parameter @xmath115 in the free flow phase on the basis of ( [ a12a ] ) . of course the correlations @xmath116 , @xmath117 etc .",
    "are _ non - vanishing _ in this phase .",
    "moreover , the vanishing order parameter @xmath118 for bulk sites , in combination with relations ( [ a5 ] ) imply the following properties of the low density _ free flow _",
    "phase : @xmath119,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a bulk site .",
    "several interesting features can be seen .",
    "first of all , the bulk dynamics is completely determined by the input rate @xmath15 at the entrance site , as already explained in section 3.2 .",
    "secondly , the flux equals the bulk density , indicating that particles are never blocked in the free flow phase , and are traveling with an average speed @xmath120 .",
    "a particle entering the lattice is never blocked until it leaves the bulk and enters the boundary layer near the exit , where it slows down to a velocity @xmath121 with @xmath122 as a consequence of the pile up .",
    "the bulk density of the system , @xmath123 , is always smaller than 1/2 , since @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , we will also refer to the phase with @xmath68 as the _ low density phase _ of the system .",
    "similarly there is a _ jammed _ phase for @xmath67 of high density @xmath92 , containing only isolated holes except in a boundary layer of width @xmath93 near the entrance .",
    "the phase is characterized by the microscopic order parameter @xmath125 , or equivalently by the non - vanishing order parameters @xmath126 , @xmath127 , etc . in the bulk .",
    "the properties of the high density phase with @xmath67 can be related to those of the low density phase with @xmath128 by the particle - hole symmetry of section 2.2 . in this case",
    ", particle - hole symmetry implies that the dynamics of particles moving forward is identical to that of the holes moving backwards . in this point of view holes",
    "are injected at the exit site with probability @xmath16 and move downstream where they are finally removed from the lattice with probability @xmath15 .",
    "so , ( [ a13 ] ) implies for the _ jammed _ phase : @xmath129 \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a bulk site in the jammed phase , defined as @xmath130 .",
    "similarly the average flux in the jammed phase follows from ( [ a8 ] ) as @xmath131 which implies an average speed @xmath132 . in the boundary layer near the entrance",
    "a particle has a higher average speed , @xmath133 , and it slows down to speed @xmath16 , because of frequent blockage by a preceding particle .",
    "the average flux may also be written as @xmath134 , indicating that the flux in the jammed phase equals the density of holes , which move with unit speed in backward direction .",
    "we note that these results are exact in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath135 .    in summary ,",
    "the phase diagram , where @xmath136 , has a high density phase ( @xmath92 ) for @xmath137 , and a low density phase ( @xmath138 ) for @xmath128 . on the line @xmath105 there are two coexisting phases , separated by an interface with an _ instantaneous _ position @xmath139 : a low density phase can be found downstream of the interface and a high density phase upstream , each occupying a finite fraction of the system ( as already discussed in section 3 ) with a jump @xmath140 in the density between the two regions . in open systems with fixed @xmath15 and @xmath141 the position @xmath139 wildly fluctuates , as it can be anywhere on the lattice with uniform probability . for a system of @xmath142 sites",
    "this statement has been verified by collecting @xmath143 measured values of @xmath139 into 10 equal - sized bins .",
    "the resulting histogram is flat within fluctuations of @xmath144 .",
    "let us compare the behavior of flux @xmath145 and bulk density @xmath94 when crossing the transition line @xmath105 , where @xmath123 and @xmath146 in the low density phase , and @xmath147 and @xmath148 in the high density phase .",
    "this shows that the flux @xmath145 is continuous across the line @xmath105 , whereas the density makes a jump @xmath149 .",
    "therefore the ness of this model shows a first order phase transition across the line @xmath105 .",
    "figure 1 shows the flux @xmath17 , as a function of the average density at a fixed value of the removal rate @xmath16 .",
    "it is the analog of the equation of state for the pressure @xmath150 in thermal equilibrium .",
    "as @xmath15 increases to @xmath16 , the flux @xmath151 , as well as the density increase up till @xmath152 . in the coexisting phase region ( @xmath153 )",
    "the flux remains constant , and the bulk density is given by @xmath154 it may be anywhere between @xmath155 and @xmath156 , as the location @xmath139 hops around the interval @xmath157 . as @xmath15 increases",
    "further @xmath158 , the density increases from @xmath159 to 1 , and the flux @xmath160 decreases . the triangle bounding the region @xmath161 is called the _ fundamental diagram _ in traffic problems , and corresponds to the coexistence region in thermodynamic phase transitions .",
    "as the interface position @xmath139 in the open system , measured over a very long period of time , is uniformly distributed over all sites of the system , one obtains in the coexisting phase region a linear density profile @xmath162 by averaging the instantaneous profiles @xmath163 over all @xmath139 , yielding @xmath164 a more detailed discussion of the dynamics of the interface will be given in the next section .    before concluding this section we discuss the collective dynamics in the different bulk phases . in the low density or free flow phase",
    "every particle is preceded by at least one hole .",
    "consequently it will advance one site per time step , and has the maximum speed @xmath165 .",
    "in fact any free flow configuration with a hole in front of it , is propagated as a whole with velocity @xmath165 . in the jammed phase on the other hand ,",
    "every cluster of @xmath166 particles is preceded by a single hole . at every time step",
    "_ only _ the lead particle of each cluster advances one site , and becomes the tail particle of the preceding cluster .",
    "therefore clusters of constant length are moving backwards with unit speed , and so do isolated holes .",
    "the @xmath166-th particle in a cluster makes its first move only after @xmath166 time steps , and the average speed of a particle @xmath167 ( see ( [ a15 ] ) ) .",
    "the motion in the jammed phase is therefore characterized by _ start - stop waves _",
    ", which are typical for most congested traffic flows .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results ( [ a13])([a15 ] ) for fully parallel updating with those for _ sublattice ",
    "parallel _ updating , as derived in ( a5)-(a7 ) of the appendix .",
    "let @xmath168 and @xmath169 be respectively the bulk density and the flux at even sites , as defined in the appendix , and @xmath170 and @xmath171 the corresponding ones for odd sites , then we have for the sublattice  parallel dynamics in the _ free flow _ phase @xmath13 , @xmath172 and for the _ jammed _ phase @xmath14 @xmath173 the average properties , in particular of the odd sites , are very different from the tasep with fully synchronous dynamics .      in this section",
    "we study the dynamics of the interface separating the low and high density phases in the coexisting phase region . to define the instantaneous location @xmath139 and the instantaneous width @xmath174 of the interface we introduce its front and tail sites @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "let @xmath176 be the position of the front hole in the first / most advanced cluster of holes , and @xmath175 that of the tail particle in the last / least advanced cluster of particles , where @xmath177 ( see section ( 3.1 ) ) .",
    "the sites @xmath176 and @xmath178 belong with certainty to the low and high density phase respectively",
    ". then the interval ( @xmath179 ) contains only @xmath180 alternating particle - hole pairs @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) , which are allowed in both phases .",
    "the instantaneous position of the interface is defined as @xmath183 and its instantaneous _ width _ as @xmath184 . as the particle ( c.q .",
    "hole ) cluster is moving with unit speed forward ( c.q .",
    "backward ) , the width decreases by 2 units per time step , vanishing after @xmath180 times steps and yielding a hole - cluster adjacent to the particle - cluster . during this period @xmath185",
    "remains fixed .",
    "what happens next depends on the sizes @xmath186 and @xmath166 of the two adjacent hole- and particle clusters respectively . if @xmath187 , the positions @xmath176 and @xmath175 remain fixed during ( @xmath188 ) time steps .",

    "the density @xmath352 is fixed , and @xmath139 is on average given through ( [ e9 ] ) , and there are only small fluctuations @xmath414 around the average @xmath139 . in summary , the previous discussion confirms our intuitive interpretation that the tasep on a ring with a blockage behaves the same as the tasep with open boundaries with injection rate @xmath415 and removal rate @xmath416 .",
    "this similarity holds for bulk properties , profiles and correlation functions .",
    "in this paper , which is in part an account of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied the non - equilibrium stationary state ( ness ) of the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) with fully synchronous and _ deterministic _ @xmath108 bulk dynamics ( i ) for open systems , coupled to particle reservoirs with injection rate @xmath417 and removal rate @xmath16 , and ( ii ) for closed systems on a ring containing a stochastic blockage site with transmission rate @xmath16 .",
    "mean field theories and the boltzmann equation give a totally inadequate description of these far - from - equilibrium states , because of the existence of strong short range correlations .",
    "the theory presented here is based on two new ideas : ( i ) we derive , starting from the microdynamic equations for the tasep , the explicit microscopic specifications of the configurations and order parameters for the separate phases ; and ( ii ) we introduce an improved _ mean field approximation _ in ( [ d2 ] ) that neglects fourth and higher order correlation functions at the interface between the bulk phase and the boundary layers .",
    "the results for the profiles have been compared with extensive computer simulations , and turn out to be indistinguishable from the analytic results .",
    "we therefore _ conjecture _ that our results for the open tasep with @xmath418 are _ exact _ up to terms that are exponentially small in the system size @xmath28 , for instance of order @xmath325 for @xmath128 . our results for the tasep on the ring with a blockage show small differences between theory and simulations . clearly",
    "the identification of the flux through a blockage as both the influx ( to define @xmath419 ) _ and _ the outflux ( to define @xmath420 ) of the open system is only approximate .",
    "moreover , the neglected correction terms @xmath325 start to become of @xmath273 as @xmath421 or @xmath422 ( see figure 8) .    the first idea has enabled us to obtain exact results not only for bulk densities and currents , but also for the spatial and temporal correlation functions . the second idea has enabled us to obtain analytic results for the profiles in the boundary layers of density @xmath423 and cluster correlation functions @xmath424 .",
    "for the more general stochastic model with @xmath425 of @xcite no analytic results for profiles and correlation functions are known .",
    "the ideas in ( i ) are akin to the elimination of the ` garden of eden ' states in @xcite , and those in ( ii ) to the ` paradisical mean field approximation ' , hinted at in ref .",
    "@xcite , but that lingo is not ours .",
    "it is of interest to compare our results for fluxes and bulk densities with known results .",

    "the corresponding phase diagram contains the present @xmath108 phase diagram for @xmath15 and @xmath16 less than @xmath428 , but it also contains more phases , such as the maximal current phase . in our @xmath108-model",
    "the maximal current phase occurs only as a _ bulk _",
    "phase for the special parameter values @xmath429 .",
    "in addition , the interface of finite width , separating the coexisting phases for @xmath430 , constitutes a ` microphase ' of maximal current configurations . in the tasep with @xmath0 the interface region ( see section 4.2 ) contains only local configurations common to both the low _ and _ high density phase .",
    "these _ common _ local configurations are identical to the local configurations that constitute the maximal current phase .",
    "it would be interesting to find out for the fully synchronous tasep with @xmath425 if it is possible to identify an interface region for @xmath431 , which constitutes a ` microphase of maximal current configurations ' as well .    in the low density regime @xmath432 of ref .",
    "@xcite the flux and bulk density are found as @xmath433 which reduce for @xmath0 to the results in ( 16 ) .",
    "the corresponding properties of the phase diagram in the high density regime can be obtained from particle - hole symmetry .    in order to illustrate the particle - hole attraction in these models , and its dependence on the hopping rate @xmath426",
    ", we compare our results for the deterministic version @xmath108 for the nearest neighbor correlation functions in the bulk ( for @xmath434 ) , i.e. @xmath435 with those for the stochastic version @xmath436 in ref .",

    "we notice that in the low density phase of the deterministic version there is a ` hard core repulsion ' for nearest neighbor sites , as @xmath438 or equivalently , a strong attraction of particle - hole pairs on nearest neighbor sites . in the stochastic version @xmath439",
    "there is also a particle - hole attraction on nearest neighbor sites , because the covariance @xmath440 i.e. there exists a positive correlation between an occupied site and the empty site , just in front of it , which increases monotonically as @xmath441 .",
    "it would be very valuable to extend the present method , based on the ideas summarized in ( i ) and ( ii ) at the start of this section , to calculate the profiles , and spatial and temporal correlation functions in the stochastic tasep of ref .",

    "in this appendix we will illustrate how the method of the present paper , when applied to the tasep with sublattice ",
    "parallel updating , yields the exact results for the bulk properties and the asymptotic ( large system ) results for profiles and correlation functions , as obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite the dynamics consists of two substeps . in the first step from @xmath442 , the pairs @xmath157 , ( 23 ) , @xmath443 are updated in parallel where @xmath28 is even .",
    "there is only a possibly non - vanishing microscopic flux @xmath444 through the _ even _ link @xmath8 , whereas the flux @xmath444 through the _ odd _ link vanishes . in the second step , from @xmath445 , the pairs ( 1,2 ) , ( 3,4 ) , @xmath446 are updated in parallel , then @xmath447 is possibly non - vanishing and @xmath444 vanishes .",
    "if we denote @xmath448 and @xmath449 respectively by @xmath450 and @xmath451 with @xmath452 , then the _ microdynamic _ equation for the first step @xmath453 becomes : @xmath454 and for the second step @xmath455 @xmath456 with the conventions @xmath457 and @xmath458 , as defined below ( [ a3 ] ) , these equations also include the boundary conditions for the open system .",
    "moreover , we observe that the evolution equations ( a1)-(a2 ) are invariant under particle - hole exchange .    in the ness there",
    "is again a constant site - independent flux through the system .",
    "the flux @xmath459 out of _ even _ sites at integer times is equal to the flux @xmath460 out of _ odd _ sites at half - integer times , i.e. @xmath461 where @xmath457 and @xmath462 and @xmath23 is _ even_.    by studying the dynamics of clusters as in section 3 one finds that ( a1)-(a2 ) impose some very strong constraints on the allowed configurations , i.e. @xmath463 this implies that configurations containing @xmath464 and @xmath465 can never be created at integer times if one starts from an empty initial state .",
    "such configurations are therefore _ absent _ in the ness for _ any _ value of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath466 on @xmath467 indicate that the relevant site has an _ even _ ( + ) or an _ odd _ @xmath468 label .",
    "of course configurations @xmath469 as well as @xmath470 are allowed at integer times .",
    "moreover , by arguments similar to those in section 3.1 and 3.2 , one shows again that the first particle - cluster can only be created at the exit site .",
    "let @xmath83 be the location of the last particle on the last cluster of particles , then the interval downstream of @xmath83 contains only _ isolated particles _ , separated by holes ( free flow configurations with interval density @xmath471 , and that upstream of @xmath83 contains only _ isolated holes _",
    "( jammed configurations with interval density @xmath472 ) .",
    "all conclusions in the last three paragraphs of section 3.1 carry over to the tasep with sublattice ",
    "parallel dynamics , and so does the phase diagram .",
    "next , we consider the bulk properties for large systems @xmath321 in the free flow phase @xmath473 and @xmath474 ) . the low density phase is again characterized by the microscopic order parameter @xmath276 . to perform these calculations , we start , as in section 4.1 , from the constant flux relations ( a3 ) in combination with the vanishing order parameter , @xmath475 valid for @xmath434 and @xmath23 even .",
    "this implies for _ odd bulk _",
    "sites @xmath476 , and for _ even bulk _ sites @xmath477 and @xmath478 .",
    "if @xmath169 denotes the flux out of even bulk sites , and @xmath170 the one out of odd sites , then the results for the free flow phase @xmath13 can be summarized as , @xmath479 the corresponding relations for the jammed phase @xmath330 can be obtained from the relations ( [ a7 ] ) for particle - hole symmetry , and read : @xmath480 and for the fluxes , using ( [ a8 ] ) , @xmath481 next , we consider the profile in the right boundary layer of the _ low density _ phase , and we construct the dynamics of the cluster functions @xmath195 , as in ( [ a10 ] ) . by specializing these equations to the low density phase one arrives after lengthy , but straightforward algebra , at a coupled hierarchy of equations for the correlation functions .",
    "let @xmath23 or @xmath482 ( with @xmath23 = even ) be the last particle position on the last particle cluster , then we find in the ness the exact relations ,    @xmath483    where @xmath23 and @xmath71 are both _",

    "our special mean field assumption for the _ low density _ phase neglects again higher order correlations between on the one hand the particle - hole pairs @xmath486 and @xmath487 , and on the other hand the tailing particle cluster at the interface of bulk phase and boundary layer .",
    "the solution of these recursion relations yields @xmath488 from these results and from ( [ a4a ] ) we obtain the density profile of the boundary layer near the exit for _ even _ sites @xmath23 , @xmath489 for _ odd _ sites @xmath482 follows similarly , @xmath490 the results for the profiles and correlation functions ( a11)-(a13 ) are in full agreement with the _ exact _ results of refs . @xcite for large systems , when terms of order @xmath267 have been neglected .",
    "in close parallel to section 5.2 , we may also calculate the spatial and temporal correlation functions in the bulk of the low density phase . by setting the microscopic order parameter @xmath276 in ( a1)-(a2 ) , the microdynamic equation for bulk sites",
