    "the fundamental problem of quantum field theory and statistical mechanics is the problem of divergences of feynman integrals emerging in green functions .",
    "the formal infinities appearing in perturbation expansion of feynman integrals are tackled with different regularization methods , from pauli - villars regularization to renormalization methods for gauge theories , see @xcite for a review .",
    "a special class of regularizations are the lattice regularizations tailored for the precise numerical simulations in gauge theories @xcite .",
    "there are a few basic ideas connected with those regularizations .",
    "first , certain minimal scale @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the cutoff momentum , is introduced into the theory , with all the fields @xmath1 being substituted by their fourier transforms truncated at momentum @xmath9 .",
    "the physical quantities are then demanded to be independent on the rescaling of the cut - off parameter  @xmath9 .",
    "the second thing is the kadanoff blocking procedure  @xcite , which averages the small - scale fluctuations up to a certain scale  this makes a kind of effective interaction .",
    "physically all these methods imply to the self - similarity assumption : blocks interact to each other similarly to the sub - blocks @xcite .",
    "similarly , but not necessarily having the same interaction strength ",
    "the latter can be dependent on scale @xmath10 .",
    "however there is no place for such dependence if the fields are described solely in terms of their fourier transform  except for the cutoff momentum dependence .",
    "the latter representation , being based on the representation of the translation group , is rather restrictive : it determines the effective interaction of _ all fluctuations up to a certain scale _ , but says nothing about the interaction of the fluctuations at a given scale .    that is why , the functional methods capable of taking into account the interaction at specific scale are required .",
    "wavelet analysis , being the multiscale alternative to the fourier transform , emerged in geophysics @xcite , is the most known of such methods .",
    "its application to quantum field theory have been suggested by many authors @xcite the other side of the problem is that the quantum nature of the fields considered in quantum field theory is constrained by the heisenberg uncertainty principle . to localize a particle in an interval @xmath11 the measuring device requests a momentum transfer of order @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath11 is too small the field @xmath1 at a fixed point @xmath2 has no experimentally verifiable meaning .",
    "what is meaningful , is the vacuum expectation of product of fields in certain region centered around @xmath2 , the width of which ( @xmath11 ) is constrained by the experimental conditions of the measurement @xcite . that is why , at least from physical point of view , any such field should be designated by the resolution of observation @xmath13 .    in present paper",
    "we exploit the observation that quantum field theory models , which yield divergent feynman graphs , can be studied analytically if we project original fields @xmath1 into the fields @xmath14 , subscribed by the scale of measurement @xmath3 .",
    "the green functions @xmath15 become finite under certain causality assumptions , which stand for the fact that any @xmath16-point correlation function can be dependent only on space - time regions , rather than points , and thus can not be infinite @xcite .",
    "these green function describe the effect of propagation of a perturbation from a region of size @xmath3 , centered at a point @xmath2 , to a region of size @xmath17 , centered at a point @xmath18 .",
    "the standard quantum field theory models can be reformulated by expressing the ( point - dependent ) local fields @xmath1 , the distributions , in terms of the region - dependent fields @xmath14 .",
    "the integration over all scales @xmath3 will of course drive us back to the known divergent results , but the physical observables are always those measured with finite resolution , and their correlations are always finite",
    ". therefore the idea of wavelet transform of quantum fields , which will be considered below , is very similar to the idea of renormalization group ( this similarity , being studied in the lattice framework @xcite , is out of coverage of the present paper ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in _",
    "section  [ cwt : sec ] _ we recall the basics of the continuous wavelet transform and its application to the multiresolution analysis of quantum fields .",
    "the definitions of scale - dependent fields and green functions , the modifications of the feynman diagram technique are presented .",
    "the @xmath0 scalar field model examples of calculations are given .",
    "_ section  [ op : sec ] _ considers the case of operator - valued scale - dependent fields .",
    "the operator ordering and commutation relations are presented .",
    "the relations between the theory of scale - dependent fields in euclidean and minkowski spaces are discussed .",
    "_ section  [ gau : sec ] _ presents the examples of calculation of one - loop feynman graphs in qed and qcd .",
    "the _ conclusion _ gives a few remarks on the perspectives and applicability of the multiscale field theory approach based on continuous wavelet transform .",
    "let @xmath19 be a hilbert space of states for a quantum field @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be a locally compact lie group acting transitively on @xmath19 , with @xmath22 being a left - invariant measure on @xmath21 .",
    "then , similarly to representation of a vector @xmath20 in a hilbert space of states @xmath19 as a linear combination of an eigenvectors of momentum operator @xmath23 can be decomposed with respect to a representation @xmath24 of @xmath21 in @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is referred to as an admissible vector , or _ basic wavelet _",
    ", satisfying the admissibility condition @xmath27 the coefficients @xmath28 are referred to as wavelet coefficients .",
    "if the group @xmath21 is abelian , the wavelet transform with @xmath29 coincides with fourier transform .",
    "the next to the abelian group is the group of the affine transformations of the euclidean space @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rotation matrix .",
    "we define unitary representation of the affine transform with respect to the basic wavelet @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 ( we use @xmath35 norm @xcite instead of usual @xmath36 to keep the physical dimension of wavelet coefficients equal to the dimension of the original fields ) .",
    "thus the wavelet coefficients of the function @xmath37 with respect to the basic wavelet @xmath33 in euclidean space @xmath30 can be written as @xmath38 the wavelet coefficients represent the result of the measurement of function @xmath1 at the point @xmath39 at the scale @xmath3 with an aperture function @xmath40 rotated by the angle(s ) @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath1 can be reconstructed from its wavelet coefficients using the formula : @xmath42 the normalization constant @xmath43 is readily evaluated using fourier transform : @xmath44 for isotropic wavelets @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the area of unit sphere in @xmath30 .",
    "if the ordinary quantum field theory defines the field function @xmath1 as a scalar product of the state vector of the system and the state vector corresponding to the localization at the point @xmath2 : @xmath47 the modified theory @xcite should respect the resolution of the measuring equipment .",
    "namely , we define the _ resolution - dependent fields _ @xmath48 also referred to as the scale components of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the bra - vector corresponding to localization of the measuring device around the point @xmath2 with the spatial resolution @xmath3 and the orientation @xmath51 ; @xmath40 labels the apparatus function of the equipment , an _ aperture _ @xcite .",
    "the field theory of extended objects with the basis @xmath40 defined on the spin variables was considered in @xcite .",
    "the introduction of resolution into the definition of the field function has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "if the particle , described by the field @xmath1 , have been initially prepared in the interval @xmath52 , the probability of registering this particle in this interval is generally less than unity : for the probability of registration depends on the strength of interaction and the ratio of typical scales of the measured particle and the measuring equipment .",
    "the maximum probability of registering an object of typical scale @xmath11 by the equipment with typical resolution @xmath3 is achieved when these two parameters are comparable .",
    "for this reason the probability of registering an electron by visual range photon scattering is much higher than by that of long radio - frequency waves . as mathematical generalization",
    ", we should say that if a measuring equipment with a given spatial resolution @xmath3 fails to register an object , prepared on spatial interval of width @xmath11 with certainty , then tuning the equipment to _ all _ possible resolutions @xmath17 would lead to the registration .",
    "this certifies the fact of the existence of the measured object .    in terms of the resolution - dependent field",
    "the unit probability of registering the object @xmath49 anywhere in space at any resolution and any orientation of the measuring device is expressed by normalization @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an invariant measure on @xmath55 , which depends on the position @xmath2 , the resolution @xmath3 , and the orientation @xmath41 of the aperture @xmath40 .",
    "if the measuring equipment has the resolution @xmath56 , all states @xmath57 are registered with significant probability , but those with @xmath58 are not , the regularization of the field theory in momentum space , with the cutoff momentum @xmath59 corresponds to the uv - regularized functions @xmath60 the regularized @xmath16-point green functions are @xmath61    however , the momentum cutoff is merely a technical trick : the physical analysis , performed by renormalization group method @xcite , demands the independence of physical results from the cutoff at @xmath62 .      to illustrate the method , following @xcite , we start with euclidean scalar field theory .",

    "for instance , the bare two - point correlation function @xmath68 is divergent at @xmath69 for @xmath70 .    for simplicity",
    "let us assume the basic wavelet @xmath40 to be isotropic , i.e. we can drop the rotation matrix @xmath32 .",
