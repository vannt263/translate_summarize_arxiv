    "although the quenched approximation to qcd is being gradually superseded by unquenched simulations , it remains useful as a qualitative guide to the physics of qcd , and as a testing ground for new methods of discretizing light fermions . in the latter role ,",
    "the unphysical chiral singularities of quenched qcd turn out to be helpful  reproducing them provides evidence that the light fermion method under study can approach the chiral limit .",
    "examples of these singularities are the enhanced chiral logarithms in the pion mass and the pseudoscalar decay constant  @xcite .",
    "the source of these singularities is the hairpin vertex , i.e. the appearance of a double - pole contribution in the flavor - singlet pion two - point function . in infinite volume ( where the contributions of exact zero modes vanish )",
    "this vertex is the key unphysical feature of quenched qcd .",
    "quenched chiral perturbation theory ( q@xmath1pt ) allows one to systematically predict the form of these singularities .",
    "although q@xmath1pt does not have the same theoretical underpinnings as chiral perturbation theory for unquenched qcd , and thus must be treated as a phenomenological theory , it has been quite successful in describing the properties of light pseudo - goldstone bosons",

    "@xcite ( referred to as bdet in the following ) .",
    "they find that consistent values of the hairpin vertex can be obtained both from a direct calculation of the hairpin correlator and from fitting to the chiral logarithms predicted from loop contributions to various quantities .",
    "there is , however , a puzzling aspect to the results for the hairpin vertex . on the one hand ,",
    "the vertex is found to have substantial dependence on quark mass . as i argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , this can be explained by a non - zero value for the momentum - dependent part of the hairpin ( @xmath2 in the notation explained below ) . on the other hand , bdet note that , at tree - level , one can also determine @xmath3 from the coefficient of the sub - leading single - pole contribution to the hairpin correlator .",
    "they find that @xmath3 determined in this way is much smaller than that determined from the mass dependence , and , in fact , is consistent with zero .",
    "the purpose of this note is to resolve the discrepancy between these two methods for determining @xmath3 .",
    "it turns out that , at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) in quenched chiral perturbation theory , the hairpin vertex picks up a mass dependence proportional to @xmath0 ( the quenched analog of corresponding gasser - leutwyler constant ) , in addition to that proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the coefficient of the single pole , however , is not affected at this order , and remains proportional to @xmath3 alone . this allows a consistent description of the hairpin results : one should use the bdet method to determine @xmath3 , with a result close to zero , while the mass dependence of the hairpin vertex determines @xmath0 .",
    "this provides a check of determinations of @xmath0 based on the mass dependence of the axial decay constant .",
    "i consider quenched qcd with @xmath4 valence quarks . for the following considerations i need @xmath5 , and for definiteness i use @xmath6 .",
    "i take all the quarks to be degenerate , since this is what has been done in numerical evaluations of the hairpin vertex .",
    "the leading order quenched chiral lagrangian is then  @xcite @xmath7 where `` @xmath8 '' indicates supertrace , @xmath9 is an element of @xmath10 , @xmath11 contains the pseudo - goldstone bosons and fermions , and @xmath12 is the `` super-@xmath13 '' field .",
    "quark masses are contained within @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mass matrix of quarks and ghost - quarks .",
    "i assume that @xmath16 is small enough that it is appropriate to use chiral perturbation theory to describe the properties of the pseudo - goldstone hadrons .    the parameters @xmath17 ( pion axial decay constant in the chiral limit , normalized so it is close to @xmath18mev ) and @xmath19 are the quenched analogs of the corresponding parameters that appear in the unquenched chiral lagrangian . the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath3 are , however , special to quenched chiral perturbation theory , in which one can not integrate out the @xmath21 .",
    "in the large @xmath22 and chiral limits , one can show that @xmath23 @xcite . assuming this holds also at @xmath24 , one expects @xmath25gev .",

    "the naive estimate ( using qcd values for the parameters ) is @xmath28 , while simulations find values in the range @xmath29 ( for a recent review see ref .",

    "these are the correlators used in simulations to study the hairpin vertex .    at low momenta the connected correlator",
    "is well described by a single pole @xmath46 where @xmath47 is , by definition , the pseudoscalar decay constant , and the sign arises from wick contractions . by contrast , the hairpin correlator is observed to have a leading double - pole contribution : @xmath48 where @xmath47 is to be determined from eq .",

    "it is necessary to discuss the power counting appropriate to quenched chiral perturbation theory .",
    "i give an overview here and a comprehensive discussion in the appendix .",
    "standard unquenched chiral perturbation theory is , in the meson sector , an expansion in @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "the issue in quenched chiral perturbation theory is how to treat the extra constants that appear , the most important of which is @xmath20 .",
    "this appears in two dimensionless combinations in the calculations considered here .",
    "first , loop contributions are suppressed by powers of @xmath67 , which , as noted above , is numerically small . , with @xmath68 the regularization scale , and thus dominate over the leading term in the extreme chiral limit .",
    "for most practical simulations , however , including those of bdet , the logarithm is of @xmath69 , and does not lead to a significant enhancement .",

    "( [ eq : treelevel ] ) is @xmath70 .",
    "it is also reasonable to treat this combination as small , given that @xmath20 is close to @xmath71 and @xmath3 is small .",
    "to do so consistently , however , one must develop a systematic power counting scheme in which both combinations are small , and for which one can assess the relative size of other contributions .",
    "two such schemes are explained in the appendix . in the first ( the standard or * pc1 * scheme ) one takes @xmath72 , while in the second ( the * pc2 * scheme ) @xmath73 . in both schemes",
    "the @xmath3 contribution to @xmath49 is non - leading : @xmath74 the schemes differ , however , in the size of other contributions . in the * pc2 * scheme , since @xmath27 is larger than @xmath75 ,  second - order \" terms of size @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are progressively smaller , while all three are treated as of the same size in * pc1*. thus the * pc2 * scheme has some similarities to that used in bdet , in which terms of relative size @xmath79 are kept , but those of size @xmath78 are not .",
    "this point is discussed further in the appendix .    in this paper",
    "i calculate the connected and disconnected correlators at nlo in the * pc2 * scheme . by nlo",
    "i mean that corrections of size up to and including @xmath75 relative to the leading contribution are included .",
    "after amputation , the disconnected vertex has the form @xmath80 , from which one can extract @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "note that one obtains a lower order result for @xmath50 than for @xmath49 because of the explicit factor of @xmath81 multiplying @xmath50 .",
    "i choose the * pc2 * scheme because it reduces the number of diagrams that contribute and thus simplifies the calculation . in both schemes",
    ", however , the general point is the same : there are other terms which contribute at the same order as the @xmath3 vertex , and these must be included .",

    "it shows that the mass dependence of the hairpin @xmath49 is _ not _ tied to the coefficient of the single pole @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in particular , the single - pole term can be absent ( as found , to good approximation , by bdet ) , but the hairpin vertex can have a linear dependence on @xmath82 . furthermore , the latter dependence provides an alternative method for determining @xmath0 .",

    "i close this section with a technical comment . in order to predict the coefficient of the single pole in the hairpin correlator one must control the corrections to the operator which creates the meson at @xmath95 relative to the leading order .",
    "this is because such a correction multiplying the double - pole leads to a contribution to the single - pole .",
    "thus it is crucial that one calculate the hairpin correlator with an operator which can be matched onto the effective theory without introducing additional coefficients at @xmath95 .",
    "this is only true for the pseudoscalar density , used here , and for the axial current . with any other",

    "it turns out , however , that this operator can be removed ( as in unquenched chiral perturbation theory ) by a field definition and appropriate shifts in @xmath0 , @xmath99 and @xmath3 .",

    "@xcite , using the quark mass dependence of the residue of the double - pole , turns out to be incorrect .",
    "the correct method is to use the residue of the single - pole , which , according to bdet , leads to @xmath101 .",
    "the mass dependence of the double - pole residue then allows one to determine @xmath0 .",
    "it will be interesting to reanalyze the results of bdet and earlier work in this light , and compare the determinations of @xmath0 with those obtained from the mass dependence of the axial decay constant , @xmath92 .",
    "as a rough first attempt , i note that my earlier estimate @xmath102 converts to @xmath103 , where i have taken @xmath104 from bdet for the value of the hairpin vertex in the chiral limit .",
    "this is close to the values for @xmath0 quoted in bdet .",
    "the calculation also suggests a simple way of displaying the consistency of the different determinations of the parameters of quenched chiral perturbation theory .",
    "it follows from the previous considerations that @xmath105 in the notation of bdet , this means that the combination @xmath106\\times f_a^2 $ ] should be independent of @xmath16 at linear order . since @xmath3 is small , this constraint explains the observed result that @xmath107 decreases with increasing @xmath16 in terms of the fact that @xmath92 increases with @xmath16 . when applying the results of this paper to numerical simulations",
    ", one should keep in mind that the previous discussion did not account for finite volume or discretization errors . concerning the former",
    ", one can include the leading effect by replacing the loop integrals with those appropriate to finite volume .",

    "in this appendix i discuss power counting schemes for quenched chiral perturbation theory , and explain that used for the calculation described in the main text .",
    "i also take the opportunity to collect some results that are presumably known to workers in the field but which , as far as i know , are not available in the literature .",
    "i use the standard notation for the chiral power counting parameter : @xmath111 , where @xmath1 refers to either @xmath82 or @xmath51 .    to make the arguments",
    "i will frequently use the fact that , in the quenched theory , diagrams involving pions ( and their graded partners ) can be converted in a precise , well - defined way , into those involving quark ( and ghost quark ) lines .",
    "this involves following flavor indices , and is allowed because of the necessary inclusion of the @xmath21 field in quenched chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the quark - line representation is that the impact of quenching is transparent : all diagrams with internal quark lines cancel against those with corresponding ghost quark lines . in the following",
    "i only consider the diagrams which remain after such cancellations have occurred , i.e. i consider power counting only for diagrams that give non - trivial contributions .",
    "the largest contributions to correlators involve vertices from @xmath35 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : l0 ] ) , so i consider first the power counting appropriate for this lagrangian alone .",
    "for diagrams with no @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices , standard chiral power counting gives the following result for the amputated n - point correlation function with external momenta of @xmath113 : @xmath114 for example , at leading order the two - point correlator gives the pion mass , @xmath115 , with corrections suppressed by the number of loops .",
    "this result , and those that follow , also apply to the n - point correlator of the pseudoscalar density , except that eq .",

    ", the ensuing analysis will be directly applicable to the correlators considered in the main text .    including @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices , i note that each such vertex introduces an extra propagator compared to the diagram without the vertex , and so their contributions ( after subtracting divergences so that loop momenta are of order @xmath82 ) are @xmath117 i include the factors of @xmath118 since , given the definition @xmath119 , they are generic . including these results the power counting for @xmath35 is @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are , respectively , the number of @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices .",
    "the appearance of @xmath123 in the contribution of the @xmath20 vertex in eq .",

    "as discussed below , one typically chooses @xmath124 , so that additional @xmath112 vertices either come at `` no cost '' or are enhanced .",
    "there is , however , a constraint on the number of @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices due to the cancellation of internal quark and ghost loops .",
    "a simple example of this constraint is that one can not have two such vertices on the same propagator , since this would require an internal quark loop .",
    "as i will explain , the general form of this constraint is @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the number of independent purely gluonic  cuts \" through the correlator . in other words ,",
    "if one traces the quark lines , they will fall into @xmath127 quark - disconnected components . in perturbation",
    "theory the only connection between these components is provided by gluons . in the cases of interest here ,",
    "the connected correlator @xmath128 has @xmath129 , while the hairpin correlator @xmath55 has @xmath130 .    to demonstrate the result ( [ eq : l0const ] ) i first consider correlators with @xmath129 , i.e. those which are connected in terms of quark lines .",
    "i need the result that the four and higher - point vertices coming from @xmath35 involve a single supertrace , and thus are themselves singly connected in terms of quark line diagrams .",
    "the cancellation of diagrams with internal quark loops then implies the following : there must be at least one path through the ( pion language ) diagram from each @xmath112 or @xmath3 vertex to each of the external pions which does not pass through another @xmath112 or @xmath3 vertex",
    ". this must be true if one leaves the original vertex in either direction .",
    "were this not the case , there would be a segment of the diagram completely `` cut - off '' by @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices , corresponding to an internal quark loop in the quark - line language .",
    "a corollary of this result is that , if one were to  pull apart \" each of the @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices to give two extra external pions for each such vertex , then the resulting  expanded \" pion - language diagram is singly connected ( in the usual sense ) .",
    "now imagine starting with an unquenched chiral perturbation theory diagram and adding as many @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices as possible on the propagators .",
    "when this has been done , the corresponding expanded diagram must be a tree diagram , since if there were any loops , the internal propagator(s ) could be expanded by adding additional @xmath112 or @xmath3 vertices .",
    "it must also be a singly connected ( pion - language ) diagram from the corollary of the previous paragraph .",
    "now , when one now sews the @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices back together again , each leads to an independent loop momentum in the original diagram , and thus @xmath131 .",
    "since this is the maximum number of such vertices that can be added , one finds the inequality ( [ eq : l0const ] ) with @xmath129 .",
    "the generalization to @xmath132 is straightforward .",
    "one can now have additional @xmath112 and/or @xmath3 vertices , since @xmath126 of them can be used to separate the @xmath127 quark - disconnected components of the diagram .",
    "thus one finds the general inequality of eq .",
    "( [ eq : l0const ] ) .    when using this formula two additional results should be borne in mind .",
    "first , there is , in general , no non - trivial lower limit on the number of @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices .",
    "one might have expected the constraint @xmath133 , i.e. that @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices are necessary to lead to quark - disconnected components .",
    "this is not the case , however , because loop diagrams involving connected vertices can lead to quark - disconnected correlators , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the hairpin vertex .",
    "second , even if a given choice of @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath134 satisfies the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l0const ] ) , there may not be a diagram contributing to @xmath135 .",
    "examples of this will be seen below .",
    "it is straightforward to include the `` standard '' @xmath137 lagrangian , @xmath36 , in the power counting .",
    "each vertex from @xmath36 gives an additional factor of @xmath75 , as in the unquenched theory , and the constraint on @xmath138 remains unchanged .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that since some of the vertices in @xmath36 contain two supertraces , it becomes more complicated to determine the `` quark - line connectivity '' of a given graph .",
    "this has no impact on the generic power counting , but means that a larger number of diagrams will vanish in the quenched theory .    as noted in the text",
    ", one must also consider operators which are built upon those in @xmath35 and @xmath36 by multiplying by additional factors of @xmath139 .",
    "two examples are given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l1b ] ) .",
    "the key observation is that these factors have the same power of @xmath140 as vertices arising from the expansion of @xmath141 .",
    "thus the power counting is unchanged , as long as @xmath121 and @xmath122 are generalized to be the number of vertices built upon the original @xmath112 and @xmath3 vertices , respectively .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath121 becomes the total number of vertices of the form @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "what is changed is the connectivity of the diagram .",
    "each extra factor of @xmath139 requires an additional loop , or gluonic cut , in the diagram , since @xmath21 closes off quark lines .",
    "thus the loop constraint generalizes to @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the total number of extra factors of @xmath21 in the diagram .",
    "note that a @xmath146 vertex contributes both to @xmath121 ( which it increments by one ) and to @xmath145 ( which it increments by two ) .",
    "each vertex involving extra factors of @xmath21 comes with a new coupling , e.g. @xmath38 in @xmath147 .",
    "these couplings are suppressed in the large @xmath22 limit because a @xmath21 vertex is connected only by gluons to the rest of the diagram .",
    "each additional @xmath139 leads to a suppression by @xmath148 .",
    "for example , if the quark loop is connected by two gluons to the rest of the diagram , there is an additional color loop , and the counting is @xmath149 .",
    "( the @xmath150 contained in @xmath17 is exactly that needed to create a state which is correctly normalized in the large @xmath22 limit . )",
    "thus i find that @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "for a general diagram , the additional suppression is by @xmath153 .",
    "i should stress that i am not claiming to extract the full @xmath22 dependence of diagrams .",
    "there is also implicit @xmath22 dependence in @xmath17 , in some of the gasser - leutwyler coefficients , @xmath154 , and in @xmath112 and @xmath3 .",
    "indeed the latter two are both proportional to @xmath148  @xcite , my idea is that , based on the general success of the ozi rule , it is likely that constants such as @xmath155 and @xmath156 are suppressed relative to unity .",
    "keeping track of the powers of @xmath148 associated with these constants allows one to implement this as one deems appropriate .",
    "higher order terms in the quenched chiral lagrangian involve more derivatives ( acting on either @xmath157 or @xmath21 ) and more factors of @xmath1 .",
    "these can be accounted for , along with those from vertices in @xmath36 , by introducing the quantity @xmath158 , which counts the number of factors of @xmath1 plus half the number of derivatives _ beyond those that would appear if the vertices were from the lowest order lagrangian @xmath35_. thus a vertex from the standard chiral lagrangian with six derivatives and one factor of @xmath1 would increment @xmath158 by three .",
    "overall , diagrams are multiplied by an extra factor of @xmath159 .",
    "there is an ambiguity in this definition of @xmath158 : does , for example , the vertex proportional to @xmath160 count as @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 or as @xmath164 , @xmath162 and @xmath165 ?",
    "in other words , does it contribute a correction proportional to @xmath166 or to @xmath167 ?",
    "these are not the same size in some power counting schemes , e.g. those discussed below .",
    "the ambiguity arises because dimensions can be balanced either by powers of @xmath20 or powers of @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , this ambiguity also arises for the @xmath168 vertices without derivatives , and i have chosen there the overall factor of @xmath169 rather than @xmath170 . fortunately ,",
    "for the calculation considered in the main text , i can leave this ambiguity unresolved , as the operators in question do not contribute until higher order than that i consider .",
    "i now apply the result ( [ eq : l01count ] ) to the examples considered in the text , namely the two - point quark - connected and disconnected correlators ( i.e. @xmath172 with @xmath129 and @xmath173 respectively ) .",
    "to do so i must decide how to treat @xmath27 , @xmath3 and @xmath148 relative to each other and to @xmath75 .",
    "this depends , of course , on the size of quark masses considered .",
    "i have in mind mesons somewhat lighter than the kaon mass , so that @xmath174 .",
    "i consider two possibilities for the relative size of the different terms .",
    "the first is @xmath175 which one might call  standard \" power counting .",
    "the key choices here are that @xmath176 , so that there is no extra enhancement of the @xmath112 vertices , and that @xmath177 is small .",
    "one might argue that @xmath178 , rather than @xmath75 , because it is proportional to @xmath148 .",
    "i prefer the smaller choice given the numerical evidence that @xmath179 .",
    "the second scheme is @xmath180 this enhances the contributions from @xmath21 vertices relative to `` standard '' chiral vertices , and is the power counting used in the text .",
    "the power of @xmath181 is chosen for a reason that will be explained below .",
    "in fact , most features of the power counting , including the application discussed in the main text , are unchanged if @xmath182 is replaced with @xmath181 .",
    "table  [ tab : ncut0 ] collects the contributions to the quark - connected correlator which are of size @xmath78 or smaller relative to the leading order , in one or both power counting schemes .",
    "table  [ tab : ncut1 ] gives the analogous contributions to the hairpin correlator , though only up to size @xmath183 .",
    "i list all contributions consistent with the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l01count ] ) , but , as can be seen from the table , some are absent in quenched chiral perturbation theory .",
    "for example , the standard one - loop",
    " tadpole diagram ( @xmath184 , all other @xmath185 s zero ) requires an internal quark loop for @xmath129 , although , as observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is present for @xmath130 .",
    "another constraint is that the only term with @xmath186 and @xmath187 , namely the interaction quoted in eq .",

    "all contributions up to relative size @xmath78 in one or both power - counting schemes are included .",

    "this involves keeping corrections of size @xmath190 , while those of size @xmath78 are dropped . here",
    "i am not treating @xmath191 as large , so i must take @xmath27 larger than @xmath75 , which leads to a scheme like * pc2*. the choice @xmath192 is made ( as opposed to @xmath193 , say ) so that the three loop @xmath194 contribution is smaller than the @xmath195 correction .",
    "nevertheless table  [ tab : ncut0 ] shows that keeping the @xmath77 correction , which is of size @xmath183 , requires keeping many other terms .",
