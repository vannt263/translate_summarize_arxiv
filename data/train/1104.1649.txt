    "the presence of a bar in a galaxy plays an important role in its evolution .",
    "approximately two - thirds of all spiral galaxies are barred ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , so any complete picture of galaxies must include the impact of bars on both their nuclear and extra - nuclear properties .",
    "secular ( i.e. internal ) galaxy evolution involving bars , oval distortions and spiral structure can have a significant effect when a galaxy is no longer merging or interacting strongly with other galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , there is believed to be a causal connection between the existence of a bar and a galaxy s circumnuclear properties .",
    "bars can drive gas from the outer disk to the inner regions of the galaxy ; gas clouds are shocked as they encounter the leading edge of the bar , lose angular momentum , and flow towards the galaxy s center @xcite .",
    "an observable result of this is that a substantial fraction of galaxies with bars show enhanced star - formation activity in their central regions , and the inflow of material is also believed to build ` pseudobulges ' , which are distinct from classical galaxy bulges @xcite .",
    "a strong global density pattern such as a bar can also produce a series of resonances between the angular velocity of the bar and the orbital motions of stars and gas in the disk , where rings can form @xcite .",
    "indeed , some galaxies with bars are known to have circumnuclear rings of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , resulting from increased gas density at or near the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) .",
    "a question that we are addressing with this study is , can the material driven to the center of a galaxy by the bar also fuel an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ?",
    "while there is clear observational evidence that bars in disk galaxies cause higher central concentrations of gas ( and hence centrally concentrated star formation ) compared to non - barred galaxies , it is unclear whether a large - scale bar is sufficient to transport material close enough for agn feeding ( typically on au scales , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "additionally , in an x - ray study by @xcite using _ ginga _ , _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ data , a strong correlation was found between absorbing column density toward type-2 seyfert nuclei and the presence of a strong bar , i.e. more than 80% of compton - thick seyfert 2s are barred .",
    "this suggests that if a low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) is present , it may be obscured from view at optical wavelengths and/or diluted by strong star - formation activity , which could lead to a misclassification as a pure star - forming nucleus .",
    "the topic of the influence of bars on galaxy evolution is not well studied at x - ray energies , but we are now able to utilize the excellent complementary imaging and spectral capabilities of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ to make detailed investigations of the x - ray characteristics of these systems . in particular , high - spatial - resolution x - ray observations with _",
    "provide an ideal method for searching for low - level agn activity in nearby galaxies , in the form of a hard central point source that may not be visible at other wavelengths .",
    "it also allows us to separate potential agn activity from other types of x - ray sources that may reside close to the nucleus , such as x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) associated with circumnuclear star - formation .",
    "indeed , x - ray surveys utilizing _ chandra _ have proved successful in recent years in identifying previously unknown llagn activity in nearby galaxies .",
    "in particular , x - ray nuclei spanning a wide range of x - ray luminosities ( @xmath5erg s@xmath2 , 210kev ) have been detected in a large fraction ( typically @xmath64570% ) of galaxies hosting low - ionization nuclear emission regions ( liners ; @xcite ) , as well as galaxies classed as having hii or transition nuclei ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "studies at other wavelengths have also recently been used to uncover previously unknown agn activity in nearby galaxies .",
    "for example , _ spitzer _ infrared ( ir ) spectroscopic surveys have revealed bonafide agn in both liners and ir - bright galaxies , some of which showed no sign of such activity in optical studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution radio imaging has been shown to be an efficient method for finding llagn activity ; compact radio nuclei have been found in @xmath7 50% of liners / llagn , which are thought to be attributable to relativistic jets produced by accreting super - massive black holes ( @xcite and references therein ) .    to begin to address the nature of the nuclear ( and off - nuclear ) x - ray emission in barred galaxies ,",
    "we have conducted a pilot study of the barred galaxy ngc  1672 , using x - ray observations from both _",
    "chandra _ ( 40ks ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( 50ks ) . here",
    "we report the results from these observations , and use supporting _",
    "hst_/acs , _ spitzer _ and atca radio observations to assist in the interpretation of the x - ray results .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows . in ",
    "[ sec:1672 ] we give background information on the target galaxy ngc  1672 . in ",
    "[ sec : data ] , we describe the _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , _",
    "hst_/acs , _",
    "spitzer _ and atca radio observations and data analysis techniques , and in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our results . in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] we discuss the nature of the nuclear emission , and in   [ sec : compare ] we compare our results with those for other barred and non - barred galaxies in the literature . throughout this paper",
    "we use a distance to ngc  1672 of 16.3mpc , corresponding to a recession velocity of 1140 km s@xmath2 relative to the centroid of the local group @xcite , with @xmath8=70 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "for this pilot study , we have selected the nearby ( 16.3mpc ) late - type barred spiral galaxy ngc  1672 ( sb(r)bc ) .",
    "it has a moderately low inclination angle ( @xmath9 , @xcite ) , and is known to have a strong bar ( 2.4  in length , corresponding to 11.4kpc at a distance of 16.3mpc ) , many hii regions in its four spiral arms , plus vigorous star formation at the ends of the bar ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it has a high ir luminosity ( log @xmath10 ) , and a global star formation rate ( sfr ) of 2.7@xmath11 yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "optical studies have given conflicting evidence as to the nature of the nuclear activity in ngc  1672 .",
    "it was noted by @xcite as having a complex or ` amorphous ' nuclear morphology , and was subsequently shown by @xcite to possess a circumnuclear ring of star formation , measuring    @xmath12 ( @xmath13kpc at a distance of 16.3mpc ) , located between two ilrs .",
    "therefore , studies of its nuclear properties that use large apertures are strongly affected by the star - formation in the ring . for example",
    ", @xcite showed that the optical emission spectrum in the central 17  was similar to those of normal hii nuclei , but with an h@xmath14/h@xmath15 ratio indicative of a large amount of dust reddening .",
    "@xcite also measured optical emission - line ratios in a relatively large @xmath16 aperture , and classified the nucleus as ` composite ' , with ratios between those of typical starburst and seyfert values .",
    "more recent optical line ratio diagnostics by @xcite of the emission within a @xmath17  slit are indicative of an hii - type nucleus , with no h@xmath14 line broadening detected .",
    "all of these studies will have been strongly contaminated by the emission from the circumnuclear starburst ring ; however they do demonstrate that this component is dominant , and that any potential agn activity would be relatively weak .",
    "more detailed , spatially resolved studies have also given ambiguous results .",
    "@xcite detected possible broadening of [ oiii ] ( @xmath6300 km s@xmath2 ) compared to h@xmath15 lines ( @xmath6150 km s@xmath2 ) in the central @xmath18 , which they suggested was evidence of a composite hii / seyfert  2 nucleus .",
    "@xcite performed a high - spatial - resolution spectral analysis of the nucleus , and found a strong increase in the [ oiii]/h@xmath15 ratio in the central 1  compared to its immediate surroundings .",
    "however , both lines had the same fwhm of @xmath6300 km s@xmath2 , and the authors classified the nucleus as a liner .",
    "@xcite also measured spatially - resolved ( 2 ) emission - line ratios , which were better modeled by a liner - type stellar photoionization model with @xmath19k , rather than photoionization by a strong agn continuum .",
    "ngc  1672 has previously been observed with at x - ray wavelengths with _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca_. three bright x - ray sources were detected in the soft 0.22.0kev band with the _ rosat _ hri and pspc , which were clearly associated with the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the brightest source was located at the nucleus , and the other two were cospatial with the ends of the bar .",
    "the nucleus had a soft x - ray spectrum consistent with thermal emission with a temperature of 0.68kev , with a soft x - ray luminosity of @xmath20erg s@xmath2 ( 0.22.0kev ) .",
    "however , these studies were again unable to resolve the nuclear emission spatially due to the 5  fwhm of the hri point - spread - function ( psf ) , and so could not determine whether the bulk of the soft emission came from a starburst or agn . furthermore , the _ asca _ data showed no evidence of significant hard ( 210kev ) emission from the nuclear source , with the hard emission in the galaxy being dominated by two off - nuclear x - ray sources ( x-3 and x-7 , see figure 4b in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it was concluded that if an active nucleus is present in ngc  1672 , it must be compton - thick , with @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "ngc  1672 was observed with _",
    "chandra _ for 40ks on april 30 , 2006 ( obsid  5932 ) using the back - illuminated s3 chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the field of view of the observation is shown in figure  [ fig : dss_fov ] ; the nucleus of the galaxy was placed at the aimpoint of the s3 chip , and the observation encompasses the entire @xmath0 = the apparent major isophotal diameter measured at the surface brightness level @xmath23 mag / arcsec@xmath24 extent of the galaxy .",
    "the data were initially processed with the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) tool suite version 3.3 , with caldb version 3.2.1 .",
    "the processing included a charge transfer efficiency ( cti ) correction and time - dependent gain correction .",
    "further data analysis was performed using ciao version 3.4 .",
    "a full - field light curve was extracted from the level-2 event list to search for periods of high background , but no strong flares were found , leaving a net exposure time of 39.6ks .      the basic data reduction was done using standard ciao data analysis threads .",
    "images were created of an 8@xmath258  region ( encompassing the full @xmath0 area of the galaxy ) at full 0.492  pixel resolution in soft ( 0.31kev ) , medium ( 12kev ) , hard ( 210kev ) and broad ( 0.310kev ) energy bands .",
    "monochromatic exposure maps were created at 0.8 , 1.0 and 2.0kev , corresponding to the peak energy in the soft , medium and hard band data .",
    "the images were adaptively smoothed using the csmooth task , with a fairly low significance of 2@xmath26 above the local background ( corresponding to @xmath6130 pixels in the body of the galaxy ) to avoid over - smoothing of faint features in the central region ( see   [ sec : results_morph ] ) .",
    "initial detection of candidate sources was carried out in each energy - band image using the ciao task wavdetect , a mexican hat wavelet source detection algorithm .",
    "wavelet scales of 1.0 , 1.414 , 2.0 , 2.828 , 4.0 , 5.657 & 8.0 pixels were used , and the significance threshold was set to @xmath27 corresponding to approximately one false detection per band over the 8@xmath258  field .",
    "a merged source list was created that included sources detected in all bands , which was used as the input list for source parameterization in the acis extract idl software ( ae ; @xcite ) .",
    "the main steps in the procedure are ( 1 ) the definition of source extraction regions based on the 90% contour of the local psf , ( 2 ) trial extraction of events within those regions , ( 3 ) improvement of positions if necessary ( see below ) , ( 4 ) full extraction of source and background spectra using final positions , and the creation of associated rmfs and arfs for each source .",
    "source positions were improved ( in step 3 ) using the check_positions stage , which computes  mean data \" and  correlation \" positions for all sources .",
    "the  mean data \" position corresponds to the central position of the extracted in - band events in the 0.310kev band , while the  correlation \" positions are obtained by convolving the data image with a position - dependent model psf .",
    "the offsets between these and the original wavdetect positions were typically 0.10.8 .",
    "the position estimates were visually reviewed , and the best was chosen for each source . where there was little difference between the estimates , the original position was retained .",
    "the source extraction regions were based on the 90% contour of the local psf at the final positions .",
    "background spectra were extracted in local annuli , with inner radii of 1.1 times of the 99% radius of the psf ( to exclude any residual source flux ) , and outer radii tailored so that each background spectrum contains at least 100 counts . for the central ( ring ) region , the whole area ( 17  radius ) was masked out from the background map due to the clumpy diffuse emission in the area , and the background subtraction for sources in this region ( except for the nucleus ) was performed using the area immediately outside this .    due to the complexity of the central region , the spectrum of the nuclear x - ray source was extracted manually in ciao using specextract .",
    "the source aperture was set to 1.2  radius , centered on the position from wavdetect ( 04@xmath2845@xmath2942.5@xmath30 , @xmath31591450.1 ) .",
    "the local background flux was measured in an annulus immediately outside this ( 1.22.0  radius ) , and was chosen using the radio contours as a guide in order to cover as much of the area inside the ring , without encountering any ring emission ( see   [ sec : results_morph ] ) .",
    "any other typical non - local background region would have left residual soft emission in the nuclear source counts .",
    "since there is significant diffuse emission in the circumnuclear ring area , it is possible that some of the candidate sources detected there may be clumpy gas rather than true point sources . to test this , we performed psf fitting using the ae task ae_radial_profile , which computes a 1-sided ks probability to determine whether the observed counts in the 12kev energy range are consistent with the model local 1.49kev psf encircled energy distribution .",
    "six candidate sources in the ring region were inconsistent with the local psf profile with a significance of @xmath32 .",
    "sources without detections in the hard 210kev band and with a ks probability @xmath32 were deemed to be diffuse and discarded .",
    "the final _ chandra _ catalog contains 28 sources inside the @xmath0 ellipse , and their properties are listed in table  [ tab : catalog ] .",
    "sources with significance of @xmath33 were retained , including faint _",
    "counterparts to two significantly detected _ xmm - newton _ sources ( for variability and completeness ) .",
    "this detection threshold corresponds to @xmath3412 net source counts .",
    "source fluxes were determined using spectral fitting ( see   [ sec : source_fits ] ) .",
    "the absolute astrometry of _ chandra _ is generally accurate to within @xmath61 . to confirm this ,",
    "the x - ray positions were compared to the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "three counterparts were found in the field ; the offsets between the x - ray and 2mass positions were small ( 0.14 , 0.16 & 0.6 ) , and in non - uniform directions , with the greatest offset for a source 4   off - axis at the edge of the field . given this accuracy , no astrometric correction was made to the _ chandra _ positions .",
    "ngc  1672 was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ for 50ks on november 27 , 2004 ( obsid  0203880101 ) .",
    "the epic mos-1 , mos-2 and pn cameras were operated with medium filters in prime full window mode .",
    "full - field light curves were accumulated for the three exposures in the 1015kev band to check for high background intervals of soft proton flares .",
    "the data were found to be clean for the duration of the observation , and the full time intervals were used in subsequent analysis : 47.9ks ( pn ) , 49.4ks ( mos1 ) & 49.5ks ( mos2 ) . all data ( images and spectra ) were created using standard patterns corresponding to single and double pixel events for the pn ( 04 ) , and patterns 012 ( single to quadruple events ) for the mos cameras . for spectral extraction , the quality flag was set to zero to reject events from bad pixels and events too close to the ccd chip edges .",
    "multi - band source detection was performed on the pn and mos data , using the methods detailed in @xcite . in brief , images were created in the following energy bands : soft ( 0.31kev ) , medium ( 12kev ) and hard ( 210kev ) .",
    "exposure maps were created for each instrument / energy band using the sas task eexpmap , and detector masks were created for each camera with emask .",
    "two methods of initial source recognition were used : eboxdetect , a sliding - box algorithm that simultaneously searches the three energy band images , and ewavelet , a mexican hat wavelet detection routine that works on individual images . both used background maps created with asmooth .",
    "the source lists from both methods were then parameterized using emldetect , which performs maximum likelihood psf fits to each source .",
    "these were then compared , and any additional sources detected with ewavelet were added to the eboxdetect source list , and the parameterization repeated .",
    "all sources significant at @xmath34 4@xmath26 in at least one energy band , and within the @xmath0 ellipse of ngc  1672 , were retained and visually inspected .",
    "spectra , arfs and rmfs were extracted from the data for each source using the sas task especget .",
    "the final _ xmm - newton _ catalog contains 19 extra - nuclear sources , and their properties are listed in table  [ tab : catalog ] along with the corresponding _ chandra _ properties .",
    "the source fluxes were again determined using spectral fitting ( see   [ sec : source_fits ] ) .",
    "note that six sources ( including the nucleus ) within the central @xmath620  radius are not spatially resolved with _",
    "xmm - newton _ ; these are marked with ( n)=nucleus and ( c)=central region source .",
    "apart from # 10 , 17 and 24 , all other sources detected in the _ chandra _ observation are detected in the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "to estimate source fluxes reliably , we have performed spectral fitting on each source using xspec v12 .",
    "detailed spectral fitting was performed on _ chandra _ sources with @xmath34 100 net counts , and on _ xmm - newton _ sources with @xmath34 100 net counts in either the pn or mos data .",
    "these spectra were binned ( grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin ) and fitted , using @xmath35 statistics , with both powerlaw+absorption ( po*wabs ) and disk blackbody+absorption ( diskbb*wabs ) models . in all cases , the powerlaw model provided the best fit .",
    "spectral parameters and corresponding 0.310kev fluxes and luminosities are shown in table  [ tab : catalog ] .",
    "for the _ xmm - newton _ data , the pn , mos1 and mos2 spectra were fitted simultaneously .",
    "the fluxes and errors from the three instruments were combined to provide a weighted mean flux for each source using the method of @xcite.barlow / statistics.html ]    for sources with @xmath36 100 net counts , a simple powerlaw+galactic absorption model was fitted to unbinned spectra using the c - statistic @xcite . since at such low count rates source parameters are difficult to constrain , the powerlaw and absorption parameters were frozen ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath22 ) , with the normalization as the only free parameter .",
    "the resulting fluxes and luminosities are also shown in table  [ tab : catalog ] .",
    "the source properties are described in   [ sec : results_sources ] .",
    "ngc  1672 was observed by the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ on august 1 , 2005 using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) wide field channel ( wfc ) in the broad - band f435w , f550 m and f814w filters , plus the narrow - band f658n ( h@xmath14 ) filter .",
    "a large dither was implemented , covering the dimensions of one of the wfc chips in order to fit the visible disk of the galaxy into each observation ( see figure  [ fig : dss_fov ] ) .",
    "exposure times were 2444s in each observation , split into four separate observations corresponding to the visibility of ngc  1672 in each single orbit .",
    "we also include in our analysis an archival acs high resolution channel ( hrc ) f330w uv observation of the nucleus of ngc  1672 , taken july 19 , 2002 , with an exposure time of 1140s .",
    "all of the acs observations were processed through the standard _",
    "multidrizzle _ pipeline @xcite . as sub - pixel dithers",
    "were not used in the observations , the drizzle parameters pixfrac and scale were set to unity , preserving the native pixel scale of both the hrc and wfc .",
    "each of the acs wfc images were astrometrically registered with 2mass stellar objects falling within the fov , yielding an astrometric fit with an rms of @xmath6 0.15 .",
    "the f658n image is significantly contaminated by continuum emission within the h@xmath14 passband ; we therefore created a continuum - subtracted image ( denoted f658cs ) using a continuum image estimated from a linear combination of the f550 m and f814w images ( weighted by their separation from the h@xmath14 line , and multiplied by the relative sensitivity of each filter to obtain the same physical units in each image ) .",
    "the acs images have a very high spatial resolution of @xmath60.1 .",
    "they show that , while the optical emission peaks in the central 2  nuclear region , it is clearly non - point like with a fwhm of @xmath630 pixels ( 1.5 ) .",
    "indeed it displays a complex / irregular morphology , and in a visual inspection we found no obvious point sources that could correspond to , for example , a nuclear star cluster ( which are generally only  marginally resolved \" in hst images of nearby galaxies , @xcite ) .",
    "the complexity and extended nature of the region suggests that the use of any moderate sized photometric aperture will result in a significant overestimate of the true flux from the nucleus .",
    "we investigated this in three ways : ( 1 ) via psf subtraction , ( 2 ) narrow aperture photometry , and ( 3 ) photometry using the _ chandra _ aperture .    to estimate the maximum magnitude of any point source at the center of the galaxy",
    ", psfs were constructed from isolated point sources in each image and subtracted from the centroid of the galaxy light in each band , scaled such that their cores resulted in a roughly zero flux value for the brightest pixel in the galaxy core . for two filters it was not possible to obtain actual psfs from the images . in the case of f330w ,",
    "the hrc field of view is too small for any bright , isolated sources to be present , while in our f658n continuum - subtracted image the stars were largely subtracted . to overcome this",
    ", we used tinytim to create artificial psfs for these filters , which were then subtracted from the data .",
    "the resulting upper limits are shown in table  [ tab : acs_photom ] .",
    "an alternative to direct psf subtraction is to use a narrow aperture for the determination of the light within the nucleus , and then to apply the aperture corrections tabulated by @xcite .",
    "we used a 0.1  ( 2 pixel ) radius aperture , and subtracted the background using an 1.22  annulus centered on the nucleus . to compare directly with the _ chandra _ observations , we have also performed photometry using the same physical aperture ( 1.2  radius ) and background annulus ( again 1.22 )",
    "the resulting magnitudes from these methods are also shown in table  [ tab : acs_photom ] .",
    "the upper limits measured using the psf subtraction method are similar to the measurements obtained from the narrow aperture , though there is a good deal of scatter between these and the larger _ chandra _ aperture measurements . given that psf subtraction gives the most stringent constraints on the magnitude of a nuclear point source , we adopt these limits for the multiwavelength comparison ( see table  [ tab : acs ] ) , and the construction of the nuclear spectral energy distribution ( sed , see   [",
    "sec : sed ] ) .",
    "the ab magnitudes were converted to flux density using abmag = @xmath312.5 log @xmath39 @xmath31 48.6 , and then into luminosity using @xmath40central filter frequency .",
    "we note that the centroid of the emission in the f330w images does not correspond with that seen in data taken at longer wavelengths , which suggests that there is some extinction along the line - of - sight .",

    ", we use the _ spitzer _ irac 3.6@xmath41 m measurement as a proxy for the k - band luminosity , and convert this to stellar mass using the k - band mass - to - light ratio of @xcite ( @xmath116 ) , resulting in @xmath117 .",
    "the universal lmxb luminosity function @xcite predicts only @xmath60.008 lmxbs above @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 for this stellar mass .",
    "the other possibility is that the x - ray and radio core emission arises from sn / snrs .",
    "although soft thermal x - ray emission is the characteristic signature of sn / snrs ( resulting from shock fronts interacting with circumstellar and ism material , e.g. @xcite ) , hard non - thermal emission is detected in some sn , possibly emitted from a young pulsar left behind in a core - collapse event .",
    "an example of this is sn  1968d @xcite , where the 210kev component has @xmath118 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "however , the soft component dominates the 0.310kev luminosity , with the hard emission only contributing @xmath610% to the total .",
    "this is not the case here ; after careful background subtraction using the area inside the ring , there are no soft 0.31kev counts .",
    "while this is likely due to absorption , the hard 210kev band luminosity dominates the detected emission .    we can also use the radio data to investigate the sn / snr option .",
    "have previously detected compact radio emission at 2.3ghz in the core of ngc  1672 , and speculated , by calculating the theoretical radio snr luminosity and comparing it to the observed luminosity , that it is possible that this can be produced by clumps of luminous radio sn , similar to those found in the nuclei of arp  220 @xcite and m82 @xcite .",
    "however , they used a sfr ( derived from far - ir data ) for the _ whole _ galaxy rather than the nuclear region , and therefore this was not conclusive evidence for or against the presence of an agn .",
    "what is required is a similar test for the nuclear region only .",
    "following the recipe of @xcite , we take the sfr and calculate the expected supernova rate , @xmath119    , integrating the sfr over a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1@xmath11 and 100@xmath11 , and a minimum initial mass for supernova detonation ,",
    "@xmath120@xmath11 :    @xmath121    where @xmath122 is the sfr .",
    "this results in @xmath123 yr@xmath2 .",
    "we can then calculate the non - thermal radio luminosity expected for this sn rate for both young supernovae ( @xmath124 , with radio lifetime @xmath125yr ) , and old supernova remnants ( @xmath126 , with @xmath127yr ) , using the following equations derived by @xcite from observations of sn1979c :    @xmath128    @xmath129    for the nuclear source in ngc  1672 , these predict @xmath130 erg s@xmath2 and @xmath131 erg s@xmath2 at 5ghz .",
    "the total of the two is a factor of 34 lower than the measured luminosity of the compact central source at this frequency ( @xmath104 erg s@xmath2 ) , which indicates that snrs are not the primary source of the radio emission .",
    "however , we must consider the uncertainties associated with the sfr conversion and extinction correction used here .",
    "@xcite have made a detailed investigation of the systematic uncertainties associated with the balmer decrement correction , and find it to be accurate to 15% on average .",
    "indeed , apart from variations in the imf , the amount of extinction present is the dominant source of uncertainty in the h@xmath14sfr conversion @xcite .",
    "once the correction has been applied , additional uncertainties arise from variations in metallicity and stellar ages , but only at the @xmath620% level @xcite . taking these factors into consideration ,",
    "we conclude that snrs can not easily account for the high radio output in the core of ngc  1672 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed ] shows the sed of the nuclear source , constructed using the spatially - resolved measurements at radio , near - ir , optical , uv and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray spectral slope , plus upper / lower limits estimated from the hardness ratio , are shown in @xmath132 units as a ` bow - tie ' . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the average llagn sed of @xcite , as well as the average seds of radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars from @xcite , which are all normalized to the 2kev nuclear x - ray luminosity of ngc  1672 .",
    "these measurements allow us to derive some useful broad spectral properties of the source .",
    "one such diagnostic is its radio ` loudness ' .",
    "@xcite define a ratio of radio - to - x - ray luminosity , @xmath133 ( 5ghz)/@xmath134 , which is more sensitive to highly absorbed sources than the traditional radio - to-@xmath135-band luminosity ratio . a 5ghz radio luminosity of @xmath104 erg s@xmath2 and a 210kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath111 erg s@xmath2 gives log @xmath136 , which classifies the nucleus of ngc  1672 as radio _ loud _ ( see their figure  5 ) .",
    "this is consistent with other llagn and the hypothesis that the majority of llagn possess relativistic jets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given the scaling of the comparison seds , the radio luminosity of ngc  1672 is consistent with that of both the average llagn and radio - loud quasars .",
    "however , there is a clear excess of emission at near - ir and optical wavelengths with respect to the average seds , which indicates that the photometry is contaminated by star - formation in the region .",
    "indeed , the optical _ hst _ measurements are considered to be upper limits on the luminosity of a nuclear point source (   [ sec : data_hst ] ) , and we denote them , and the near - ir measurements , as such with arrows .",
    "this excess indicates that the nuclear emission is a combination of both a low - accretion - rate central black hole _ and",
    "_ star formation in the central @xmath6200pc around the black hole ; this agrees with the study of @xcite , who detected both narrow and slightly broadened weak optical emission lines in the central @xmath18 nuclear region ( see   [ sec:1672 ] ) and concluded that they likely represent a composite hii / seyfert nucleus .",
    "we can also test whether the h@xmath14 luminosity is consistent with the @xmath137 correlation of @xcite for agn .",
    "the underlying physical reason for this relation , which holds from bright quasars all the way down to the llagn regime , is that the optical emission lines are powered by photoionization from a hard agn continuum , which naturally scales with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "type-1 objects follow the relation strongly , while type-2 seyferts / llagn tend to be more under - luminous in x - rays ( see figure  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that either the h@xmath14 luminosity may also have a contribution from other processes ( e.g. , star formation ) in the vicinity of the central black hole in these objects , or that the agn is highly absorbed and therefore only _ appears _ under - luminous in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the nuclear source of ngc  1672 , with @xmath138 erg s@xmath2 and @xmath13910@xmath113 erg s@xmath2 , is under - luminous in x - rays , consistent with other type-2 agn in the @xcite survey .",
    "@xcite show a similar figure for a sample of liners observed with _",
    "chandra _ , and also include luminosity ranges where a pure starburst would fall ( see their figure  7 ) .",
    "the nuclear source in ngc  1672 falls in the region below the @xcite agn relation and above that expected for starbursts , again strongly suggesting that this is a type-2 agn .",
    "we have also calculated _",
    "irac colors to compare with the color - color diagram of @xcite , which separates pah - dominated ( star - forming ) , stellar - dominated ( passive ) and continuum - dominated ( agn ) sources .",
    "the colors of the nuclear source of ngc  1672 ( log@xmath140=-0.27\\pm 0.03 $ ] and log@xmath141=0.10\\pm 0.01 $ ] ) fall at the intersection of all three source types , indicating again that there is some star - formation activity in the nuclear region ( which agrees with the imaging , see figure  [ fig : ctr](d ) , where the pah emission is clearly visible )",
    ".      since there is evidence for a composite nucleus with some absorption , we can investigate whether it is compton - thick ( @xmath142 @xmath22 ) .",
    "observationally , the nuclear source is faint and hard at x - ray wavelengths , with an upper limit on the absorption of a modest value of @xmath78 @xmath22 ( as derived from the hardness ratio ) .",
    "however in compton - thick sources , the direct x - ray emission is completely suppressed below @xmath610kev ; the observed 210kev component represents x - rays reflected or scattered by surrounding material , which tends to produce a hard x - ray spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the observed luminosity and spectral slope will not be representative of the intrinsic properties of the source ( e.g. the archetypal seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  1068 , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and may lead to mis - classification as a moderately absorbed llagn .",
    "an x - ray signature of a compton - thick agn is a strong fe k@xmath14 line at 6.4kev ( equivalent width typically @xmath7 1kev ) , due it being measured against a depressed x - ray continuum @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of ngc  1672 we can not place any meaningful limits on the presence of such a line due to the low number of counts in the _ chandra _ detection .",
    "the 720ev equivalent width upper limit from the _ xmm - newton _ spectral fits ( see   [ sec : results_spectra ] ) does not provide a good constraint due to dilution by sources in the circumnuclear ring .",
    "other multiwavelength measurements can also provide evidence for the presence or absence of strong absorption .",
    "for example , an indicator that a source may be highly absorbed is the ratio of 210kev x - ray flux to the [ o iii ] @xmath1435007 line flux .",
    "the [ o iii ] line is believed to be a measure of the intrinsic brightness of the source since it is produced by the photoionizing agn continuum , but in the narrow line region ( nlr ) far from the nucleus ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite measured the [ o iii ] flux from the central 2  of ngc  1672 as @xmath144 erg s@xmath2 @xmath22 .",
    "together with the observed 210kev x - ray flux of @xmath145 erg s@xmath2 @xmath22 , this gives @xmath146 } = 0.99^{+0.47}_{-0.34}$ ] .",
    "unfortunately , this is inconclusive , as it falls on the borderline of the compton - thick category ( typically @xmath36 1 , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and some confirmed compton - thick galaxies have ratios within our error range ( e.g. ngc  3079 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it indicates that there is some absorption in the nucleus , which is consistent with type-2 classification .",
    "how do the results for ngc  1672 fit into the broader picture of agn evolution ?",
    "do more barred galaxies contain agn than non - barred galaxies because of the extra fuel provided , and what are their x - ray luminosities ? what effect does the presence of a circumnuclear ring have ?",
    "a preliminary inspection of published results for nearby spiral galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ to date reveals a large range of observed nuclear x - ray properties , regardless of morphological type .",
    "for instance , while the strongly - barred galaxies ngc  1365 , ngc  1386 , ngc  3079 and ngc  3393 are classified as compton - thick , with absorption - corrected 210kev x - ray luminosities of @xmath147 erg s@xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , other strongly - barred systems such as ngc  660 , ngc  1023 and ngc  2787 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have observed nuclear luminosities of only @xmath148 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "a similar range of x - ray luminosities is found for unbarred galaxies , such as m31 and m51 ( @xmath149 erg s@xmath2 , @xmath150 erg s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) , m33 ( @xmath151 erg s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) and ngc  7212 ( @xmath152 erg s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the range of nuclear luminosities for galaxies with circumnuclear rings , which are predominantly found in barred galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , is also broad .",
    "examples are ngc  4736 ( @xmath151 erg s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) , ngc  4303 ( @xmath153 erg s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) , ngc  1097 ( @xmath154 erg s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) , ngc  1365 ( @xmath155 erg s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) , and even non - detections in some cases such as ngc  3351 ( @xmath156 erg s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) and ngc  4314 ( @xmath157 erg s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the presence of a ring does not affect the x - ray luminosity of the nucleus in an obvious or straight - forward way .",
    "for example , they do not all possess low - luminosity nuclei , which would be expected if a ring prevents the fuel from reaching the very center of the galaxy , a scenario suggested by @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that galaxies with non- or low - luminosity detections have agn that are highly absorbed , or even compton - thick , which is more likely in barred systems due to the increase in gas / star formation activity in the central regions .    in a recent survey of 187 nearby galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ , @xcite found no correlation between the presence of a strong bar and the frequency or x - ray luminosity of nuclear sources .",
    "indeed , they found a possible anti - correlation , in that strongly - barred galaxies tend to have less - active nuclei than unbarred or weakly - barred galaxies .",
    "however , this study did not take into account the presence / absence of circumnuclear rings , or other smaller - scale features such as nuclear bars .",
    "additionally , hydrodynamic mechanisms such as turbulence in the ism close to the nucleus ( e.g. nuclear spirals ) may play a significant role in agn fueling @xcite .",
    "clearly , an extensive multiwavelength investigation is required to untangle the possible effects of large- and small - scale morphological features , as well as significant absorption , on the x - ray properties of agn . that is beyond the scope of this paper , but will be addressed in a future study .",
    "this paper is part of a continuing study in which we are aiming to ascertain how both the large- and small - scale morphology of a galaxy may affect its nuclear activity .",
    "we are studying this primarily from an x - ray perspective , as x - ray observations provide an ideal tool for searching for low - level nuclear activity that may not be visible at other wavelengths . here , we have performed a pilot study on the nearby barred spiral galaxy ngc  1672 , using the high - spatial - resolution imaging power of _ chandra _ , in conjunction with the spectral capabilities of _ xmm - newton _ , to study the x - ray properties of the nuclear emission .",
    "we have supplemented this with multiwavelength imaging data from the _",
    "hst_/acs , _ spitzer _",
    "irac and atca ground - based radio observations .",
    "we have also analyzed the x - ray point source and diffuse emission properties of this galaxy .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we detect 28 x - ray sources within the @xmath0 area of the galaxy , ranging between @xmath52 erg s@xmath2 in the 0.310kev band .",
    "the positions of many of the sources outside the nuclear region correlate with star - formation in the bar and spiral arms , and two are identified as background galaxies in the _ hst _ images .",
    "nine of the x - ray sources are ulxs , with the three brightest ( @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ) located at the ends of the bar .",
    "there is also a diffuse component that traces star formation in the bar region , with a total x - ray luminosity of @xmath57 erg s@xmath2 in the 0.52kev band .",
    "2 .   with high - spatial - resolution _ chandra _ imaging ,",
    "we have shown , for the first time , that ngc  1672 possesses a hard ( @xmath3 ) nuclear x - ray source , with a low 210kev luminosity of @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 ( figure  [ fig : ctr ] ) .",
    "this in turn is surrounded by an x - ray bright circumnuclear star - forming ring ( comprised of point sources and hot gas ) , which dominates the 210kev x - ray emission in the central region of the galaxy ( @xmath158 erg s@xmath2 within a radius of 22 ) .",
    "the ring structure and nuclear source are also present in the radio and ir imaging .",
    "the central ring region is not spatially resolved with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , but spectral fits indicate that there is no significant long - term variability of the nuclear flux over the 2 year period between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations , or with respect to _ rosat _ hri observations 9 and 14 years earlier .",
    "spatially resolved , multiwavelength photometry of the nuclear source supports the hypothesis that it is an llagn accreting at a low rate ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the main discriminator is a bright radio counterpart , which can not be easily accounted for by other possibilities such as a normal xrb or the combined emission from young sn / snrs .",
    "the broad - band sed is consistent with a radio - loud llagn , although an excess of optical and ir flux indicates the presence of star formation activity close to the central black hole .",
    "the _ hst _ imaging also shows the presence of a nuclear spiral , which is a candidate mechanism for agn fueling @xcite .",
    "while the x - ray hardness ratio indicates that there is some absorption present in the nuclear region ( @xmath159 @xmath22 ) , the ratio of the 210kev x - ray flux to the [ o iii ] @xmath1435007 line flux does not provide strong evidence that the nucleus is compton - thick .",
    "a preliminary investigation of published results shows that both barred and unbarred spiral galaxies possess a broad range of observed nuclear x - ray luminosities . to further investigate the effect that bars , and their associated circumnuclear features , have on their nuclear activity",

    ", we will use complementary _ chandra _ observations to measure their nuclear x - ray properties and search for a potentially absorbed agn .",
    "morphological classification of galaxies is also vitally important , as newer ir surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) are discovering that more galaxies host bars than optical data suggest .",
    "galaxies classed as ` oval ' should also be considered , since they may be just as effective as barred galaxies at moving gas from the disks of galaxies to their nuclear regions @xcite .",
