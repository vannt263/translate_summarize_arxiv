    "one of the most striking things in modern cosmology is the universe undergoing an accelerated state @xcite . in order to explain this phenomenon , people have introduced new component which is known as dark energy .",
    "the simplest model is cosmological constant ( @xmath7cdm ) . it is consist with all kinds of observations while it indeed encounters the coincidence problem and the `` fine - tuning '' problem .",
    "besides , there are many other dark energy models including holographic dark energy @xcite , quintessence @xcite , quintom @xcite , phantom @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas @xcite and so on . besides dark energy",
    ", the acceleration can be explained in other ways .",
    "if the new component with negative pressure does not exist , general relativity ( gr ) should be modified . until now , at least two effective theories have been proposed .",
    "one is considering the extra dimensions which is related to the brane - world cosmology @xcite .",
    "the other is the so - called f(r ) gravity @xcite .",
    "it changes the form of einstein - hilbert lagrangian by f(r ) expression .",
    "these theories can give an acceleration solution naturally without introducing dark energy .",
    "there are two kinds of forms about the f(r ) , the metric and the palatini formalisms @xcite .",
    "they give different dynamical equations .",
    "they can be unified only in the case of linear action ( gr ) . for the palatini approach ,",
    "the form @xmath1 is chosen so that it can result in the radiation - dominated , matter - dominated and recent accelerating state .",
    "furthermore , it can pass the solar system and has the correct newtonian limit @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we consider the palatini formalisms . under this assumption",
    ", the f(r ) cosmology has two parameters .",
    "what we want to emphasize is , among the parameters @xmath13 , only two of them are independent .",
    "therefore , we can exhibit the constraint results on either @xmath14 space or @xmath15 space .",
    "various observations have already been used to constrain f(r ) gravity including snia , cmb , bao , hubble parameter ( h(z ) ) and so on . among these works ,",
    "parameter @xmath16 has been constrained to very small value . in these papers @xcite",
    ", they get @xmath17 ; in @xcite , the matter power spectrum from the sdss gives @xmath18 ; in @xcite , the @xmath16 was constrained to @xmath19 . from these results ,",
    "the f(r ) gravity seems hard to be distinguished from the standard theory , where @xmath6 .",
    "one effective way to solve this problem in astronomy is combining different cosmological probes .",
    "strong lensing has been used to study both cosmology @xcite and galaxies including their structure , formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "the observations of the images combined with lens models can give us the information about the ratio between two angular diameter distances , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the former one is the distance between lens and source , the latter one is the distance from observer to the source .",
    "because the angular diameter distance depends on cosmology , the @xmath22 data can be used to constrain the parameters in f(r ) gravity . in this letter",
    ", we select 63 strong lensing systems from slacs and lsd surveys assuming the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model or the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) model is right .",
    "moreover , a sample of 10 giant arcs is also contained . using these 73 data ,",
    "we try to give a new approach to constraining f(r ) gravity .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly describe the basic theory about f(r ) gravity and the corresponding cosmology . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the lensing data we use , the cmb data and the bao data .",
    "the constraint results are performed in section 4 . at last , we give a summary in section 5 . throughout this work",
    ", the unit with light velocity @xmath23 is used .",
    "the basic theory of f(r ) gravity has been discussed thoroughly in history . for details , see ref . @xcite . in palatini approach ,",
    "the action is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the gravitational constant and @xmath28 is the usual action for the matter .",
    "the ricci scalar depends on the metric and the affine connection : @xmath29 where the generalized ricci tensor @xmath30 the hat represents the affine term which is different from the levi - civita connection .",
    "the ricci scalar is always negative . by varying the action with respect to the metric components",
    ", we can get the generalized einstein field equations : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the matter energy - momentum tensor . for a perfect fluid , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the energy density",
    ", @xmath36 is the pressure and @xmath37 is the four - velocity . varying the action with respect to the connection gives the equation @xmath38=0.\\ ] ] from this equation , we can obtain a conformal metric @xmath39 which is corresponding to the affine connection .",
    "the generalized ricci tensor can be related to the ricci tensor @xmath40 in the next , we will introduce the dynamical equations of f(r ) cosmology . since all kinds of observations support a flat universe , we assume a flat frw cosmology .",
    "the frw metric is @xmath41 where the scale factor @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the redshift .",
    "we choose @xmath44 , the subscript `` 0 '' represents the quantity today . from eq.([ricci tensor ] ) , we can obtain the generalized friedmann equation @xmath45 where the overdot denotes a time derivative .",
    "the trace of eq.([field eq ] ) can gives @xmath46 considering the equation of state of matter is zero , eq.([trace ] ) can give the relation between matter density and redshift @xmath47 also , considering the energy conservation equation , eq.([trace ] ) can give @xmath48 according to eq.([trace ] ) , eq.([dotr ] ) and eq.([gfriedmann ] ) , we can get the hubble quantity in term of @xmath49 @xmath50 this is the friedmann equation in f(r ) cosmology . for each @xmath49",
    ", we can get the redshift corresponding to that time .",
    "the angular diameter distance between redshifts @xmath51 and @xmath52 is @xmath53 the @xmath22 is given by @xmath54",
    "in this section , we introduce the data we use , the lensing data , cmb and bao .",
    "these data are independent of the hubble constant .      similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , our data set consists of two parts .",
    "firstly , we choose 63 strong lensing systems from slacs and lsd surveys @xcite .",
    "these systems have been measured the central dispersions with spectroscopic method .",
    "though some of the lensing systems have 4 images , we assume the sis or the sie model is correct .",
    "the einstein radius can be obtained under this assumption @xmath56 it is related to the angular diameter distance ratio and stellar velocity dispersion @xmath57 or the central velocity dispersion @xmath58 which can be obtained from spectroscopy .",
    "secondly , the galaxy clusters can produce giant arcs , a sample of 10 galaxy clusters with redshift ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 is used under the @xmath16 model @xcite .",
    "now , we have a sample of 73 strong lensing systems .",
    "there are listed in table 2 .",
    "we can fit the f(r ) cosmology by minimizing the @xmath59 function @xmath60      for cmb , the shift parameter @xmath61 is an important quantity which depends on the cosmology @xcite . in f(r ) cosmology , it can be expressed as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the redshift of the recombination epoch .",
    "the 7-year wmap gives the value @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 can be defined as @xmath66    for bao , we take the a parameter which is expressed as @xcite @xmath67^{2/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath68 .",
    "the sdss bao measurement gives @xmath69 , where the scalar spectral index is taken to be @xmath70 as measured by wmap7 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 for bao can be defined as @xmath71",
    "in the friedmann equation [ 12 ] , we can find the ricci scalar r is always divided by @xmath73 , so we can choose units so that @xmath74 . for given @xmath14 , we can get the ricci scalar today @xmath75 using the friedmann equation .",
    "then we can get @xmath76 through eq . [",
    "now , we can get the relation between the ricci scalar and the redshift through eq . [",
    "we use the 73 @xmath22 data to constrain f(r ) gravity in palatini approach .",
    "fist , we show the @xmath14 parameter space in figure 1 .",
    "we can see the @xmath22 data is compatible with the h(z ) data @xcite .",
    "the best - fit values are @xmath2 . using the @xmath22 data only can not give a stringent constraint . after adding the cmb and the bao data , the parameters are tightly constrained .",
    "the best - fit values are @xmath4 .",
    "what we want to emphasis is the hubble parameter should always be positive , which restricts the parameters further .",
    "we also exhibit the @xmath15 parameter space in figure 2 .",
    "the best - fit values are @xmath3 for @xmath22 data and @xmath5 for combination with cmb and bao . moreover , if we further fix @xmath6 , the best - fit value for @xmath8 is @xmath8=@xmath9 for lensing data and @xmath8=@xmath10 for combined data respectively . from the results above",
    ", we can see the @xmath7cdm model which is corresponding to @xmath77 or @xmath78 is within @xmath79 range . in order to compare the @xmath22 data , we list some constraint results from other cosmological observations in table 1 .     and @xmath80 contours for @xmath14 parameter space arising from the @xmath22 data ( red line ) , * cmb+bao(green line ) * and @xmath22 data+cmb+bao ( blue line ) .",

    "the @xmath22 data propose a new way to probe the cosmology @xcite . as we expect",

    "second , the measurements of velocity dispersions have some uncertainties .",
    "finally , the error exists due to the influence of line of sight mass contamination @xcite . combining with cmb and bao",

    "until now , we can not distinguish it from the standard cosmology , where @xmath6 . for future lensing study , in order to improve the constraint , we hope large survey projects can find more strong lensing systems .",
    "at the same time , a better understand about the lens model and more precise measurements can give us more stringent results and more information about f(r ) gravity .",
