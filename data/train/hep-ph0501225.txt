    "the ratio of the two nuclear modification factors thus obtained is shown in fig .",
    "one sees that the mass dependence of final state parton energy loss leads to a significant change of the nuclear modification factor of @xmath1 mesons up to transverse momenta of @xmath76 .",
    "this is consistent with the general observation that the mass dependence of parton energy loss is a function of @xmath77 and becomes negligible for @xmath78  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one also sees that the ratio of the realistic nuclear modification factor to the one for @xmath79 has a maximum around @xmath80@xmath81 , and drops slightly below unity for very small @xmath0 .",

    "this complicates the analysis of heavy meson spectra and their decay products at low @xmath0  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the following discussion will mainly focus on the region @xmath83 .    as explained in the introduction , the mass dependence of parton energy loss displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is only one of several parton species dependent modifications of parton energy loss .",
    "other modifications result from the dependence of parton energy loss on the color charge of the parent parton , and from trigger bias effects related to the partonic @xmath0 spectrum and the parton fragmentation function . to disentangle the relative strength of these effects , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the heavy - to - light ratio @xmath84 ( @xmath7 referring to light - flavored hadrons ) for model calculations in which the above mentioned mass - sensitive medium dependences have been switched off selectively .",
    "parametrically , the mass dependence of the medium - induced parton energy loss and of the trigger biases becomes negligible at high transverse momentum where @xmath85 .",
    "in contrast , the difference between quark and gluon energy loss stays at all @xmath0 due to the ratio of the casimir factors @xmath86 .",
    "hence , at the highest @xmath0 , the color charge dependence of parton energy loss dominates the difference between the nuclear modification factor for light - flavored and heavy - flavored hadrons . in agreement with this argument , fig .",

    "charm quarks start to behave like light quarks and the heavy - to - light ratio of @xmath1 mesons becomes mainly sensitive to the color charge dependence of parton energy loss .",
    "however , at rhic energies , the corresponding signal is rather small , see fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the mass dependence of parton energy loss dominates the deviation of @xmath87 from unity for @xmath89 .",
    "however , as discussed above , the particle species dependence of @xmath90 for @xmath91  @xcite makes the application of parton energy loss questionable .",
    "thus , to assess the mass dependence of parton energy loss with the heavy - to - light ratio @xmath87 at rhic , one should focus on the kinematical region , @xmath5 .",
    "even in that region , the color charge effect is sizable and has to be taken into account in a quantitative analysis , see fig .",

    "it dominates over the color charge dependence .",
    "as for all spectra discussed above , the medium - dependence of trigger bias effects is rather small for beauty production at the lhc [ in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , these trigger bias effects account for the small but visible differences between @xmath87 and @xmath105 in the model calculation in which the mass dependence of parton energy loss has been neglected . ] .",
    "we conclude that the heavy - to - light ratio @xmath105 in pb ",
    "pb collisions at the lhc provides a very sensitive hard probe for testing the parton mass dependence of parton energy loss in the theoretically rather clean and experimentally accessible kinematical regime of @xmath102 .",
    "the mass dependence of parton energy loss and its phenomenological consequences for heavy - to - light ratios have received significant interest recently @xcite , since they provide a tool to test the conjectured microscopic dynamics underlying the phenomenon of high-@xmath0 hadron suppression at rhic . here , we have shown that heavy - to - light ratios are not solely sensitive to the mass dependence of parton energy loss , but also to its color charge dependence . the task for both experiment and theory is to identify and to disentangle both effects .",
    "this issue is of fundamental importance since the more precise understanding of the dynamics modifying a hard probe is a prerequisite for the more precise understanding of the properties of what is probed , namely dense qcd matter .",
    "previous proposals to search for the color charge dependence of parton energy loss either tried to exploit the weak @xmath0 dependence of the quark - to - gluon ratio of parent partons in light - flavored hadron spectra  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , they focused on proton - to - antiproton ratios at high @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "since antibaryons receive a larger fragmentation contribution from gluon parents , parton energy loss predicts an increase of the @xmath106 ratio with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "however , the kinematical range for studying proton - to - antiproton ratios is rather restricted due to experimental limitations on measuring identified baryons at high-@xmath0 , and due to the anomalous baryon - to - meson ratio which complicates the physics interpretation at intermediate @xmath0 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "similar caveats apply to the ratio @xmath107 .",
    "this baryon - to - antibaryon ratio may have the experimental advantage that it can be measured via topological reconstruction to higher @xmath0 than the @xmath106 ratio .",
    "however , its sensitivity to the medium - modification of parton dynamics remains to be assessed , and may be complicated due to our limited knowledge about @xmath108 fragmentation functions .",
    "compared to these measurements , the heavy - to - light ratios of @xmath1 mesons have significant experimental and theoretical advantages . in particular , in pb ",
    "pb collisions at the lhc , they show a high sensitivity to the color charge dependence of parton energy loss in a kinematical range @xmath102 in which charm quarks behave like light quarks and other medium modifications are expected to be negligible , see section  [ sec4 ] . thus , they provide a unique way to `` tag '' a light quark ( namely the charm quark ) since they can be characterized experimentally by cross - checking several relatively clean decay channels .    on the other hand ,",
    "the heavy - to - light ratio of @xmath2 mesons in the same kinematical regime @xmath102 at the lhc is expected to be predominantly sensitive to the mass dependence of parton energy loss , showing significant enhancement factors of the order @xmath109 , see section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "thus , a combined analysis of open charm and beauty mesons at the lhc provides the means to quantify and to disentangle the characteristic differences of the strength of the parton energy loss for the different identities of the parent parton .    in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic ,",
    "the task of identifying and disentangling the color charge and mass dependence of parton energy loss is more challenging , since a significantly smaller kinematical range of high transverse momentum is experimentally accessible .",
    "in particular , the region up to at least @xmath91 can only provide circumstantial evidence to this end , since it is known to receive significant additional particle species dependent non - perturbative contributions . in view of the present study ,",
    "the first use of rhic heavy meson spectra in the context of testing parton energy loss is to test the _ combined _ effect of the mass and color charge dependence of parton energy loss in the kinematical range @xmath5 where @xmath87 is expected to be gently but visibly enhanced above unity , see section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "we finally note that correlation measurements may provide important complementary information for elucidating the influence of parton identity on final state parton energy loss .",
    "for example , requiring that a high-@xmath0 trigger hadron at forward rapidity is balanced by a recoil at mid - rapidity , one may be able to study medium - modified hadron production in a configuration which enriches the contribution of gluon parents . both at rhic and at the lhc , the class of correlation measurements with this potential is large .",
    "it includes many as yet unexplored observables such as three jet events which in large acceptance experiments at the lhc may give access to the study of well - separated samples of quark and gluon jets .",
    "these correlations lie outside the scope of the present work . to the best of our knowledge",

    "[ figa2 ] and  [ figa3 ] satisfy the normalization condition @xmath139 our starting point , the gluon energy distribution ( [ a.1 ] ) , is derived in the eikonal limit and holds to leading order in @xmath119 . in this high energy approximation , it is possible that for a finite parton energy @xmath23 , the quenching weight has support in the region @xmath140 .",
    "this is clearly an artifact of the formalism .",
    "we correct it by assuming that a parton which is predicted to lose more than its total energy has lost all its energy in the medium . to this end , we truncate @xmath141 at @xmath142 but we ensure the normalization ( [ a.6 ] ) by adding a @xmath143-function  @xcite @xmath144 the corresponding monte carlo implementation is : sample an energy loss @xmath24 and set the new parton energy to 0 if @xmath145 .    the size of the remainder term @xmath146 has been used  @xcite to estimate the systematic theoretical uncertainties in this formalism .",
    "these uncertainties increase with increasing parton energy loss and they decrease with increasing transverse momentum . for the nuclear modification factors @xmath90 of both light - flavored and heavy - flavored hadrons , they amount to typical uncertainties of @xmath147 at @xmath148 and @xmath149 at @xmath150 .",

    "<S> in contrast , due to the larger @xmath4 quark mass , the medium modification of @xmath2 mesons in the same kinematical regime provides a sensitive test of the mass dependence of parton energy loss . at rhic energies , the strategies for identifying and disentangling the color charge and mass dependence of parton energy loss are more involved because of the smaller kinematical range accessible . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that at rhic , the kinematical regime best suited for such an analysis of @xmath1 mesons is @xmath5 , whereas the study of lower transverse momenta is further complicated due to the known dominant contribution of additional , particle species dependent , non - perturbative effects .    </S>",
