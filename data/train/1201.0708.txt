    "penalized splines have been popular in recent years , as penalized splines use fewer knots , thus need less computation than smoothing splines .",
    "et al . _  ( 2003 ) treat penalized splines extensively and also give numerous applications .    however , the theory of penalized splines has been remaining an interesting but challenging problem . opsomer and hall ( 2005 )",
    "first studied the asymptotic theory of penalized splines when @xmath31 , the number of knots , is infinite .",
    "li and ruppert ( 2008 ) derived the first asymptotic distribution with low degree of splines and with low order of penalty .",
    "et al . _  ( 2009 ) related penalized splines with some ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , and by studying green s functions associated with those odes , they were able to derive the asymptotic distribution of penalized splines .",
    "in contrast to li and ruppert ( 2008 ) , kauermann _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2009 ) considered the situation when @xmath31 increases at a moderate rate . though they did not obtain an explicit expression for the asymptotic bias and variance , they generalized their results for non - normal responses .",
    "et al . _  ( 2009 ) showed that depending on whether @xmath32 increasing at a sufficiently fast or a sufficiently slow rate , the asymptotic distribution of penalized splines is either close to that of a smoothing spline or a regression spline .",
    "correspondingly , they referred to these two cases as either a large or small @xmath31 scenario .",
    "the large @xmath31 scenario is closest to current practice , as discussed , for example , in osullivan ( 1986 ) , eilers and marx ( 1996 ) , and ruppert _ et al . _  ( 2003 ) , a relatively large number of knots is used and overfitting is controlled by a careful choice of smoothing parameter .",
    "one general approach to the theory of penalized splines is to use an equivalent kernel method , which was first used by silverman ( 1984 ) for studying the asymptotics of smoothing splines .",
    "the equivalent kernel method was also useful in studying the asymptotics of p - splines ( li and ruppert , 2008 ; wang _ et al . _ ,",

    "we also derive the asymptotic distribution of p - splines near the boundary , acknowledging the existence of wang _ et al . _  ( 2009 ) . the conjecture , that provided it is fast enough",
