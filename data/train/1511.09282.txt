    "in this appendix , we give an explicit description of the effective @xmath98 theory of modified double - gyroid ( dg ) photonic crystals . the low energy theory near the triple degeneracy at the @xmath1 point for unmodified dg phc",

    ", we consider the perturbations lowering @xmath21 symmetry to @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "the most relevant perturbation near the @xmath1 point is a constant term which does not depend on @xmath15 . as there is only one such term ( proportional to @xmath106 ) , which respects the @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "thus we have @xmath28 .",
    "the aforementioned line node in the @xmath30 plane can be obtained by diagonalizing @xmath107 directly .",
    "this line node is protected by the @xmath31 symmetry .",
    "to illustrate , the dispersions along the @xmath2 axis are given by : @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the reflection subspaces while @xmath111 denote the states in one of the reflection subspace . among the range that @xmath112",
    ", the crossing of two bands is inevitable , namely , the crossing between @xmath113 and @xmath114 must occur .",
    "the crossing along @xmath2 axis is given by @xmath115 .",
    "since they are in different subspaces , the hybridization is forbidden so long as the reflection symmetry is present .",
    "the next - relevant terms are those that are linear in momentum . in dg phc ,",
    "the time - reversal symmetry is present without applying external magnetic field .",
    "since momentum is odd under the time reversal operation t , only the time reversal odd matrices , i.e. , @xmath16 have to be taken into considerations at linear level .",
    "the t invariant perturbation is given by @xmath116 for a real matrix @xmath117 .",
    "restricting to @xmath22 symmetry , only two elements of @xmath117 survive , namely , @xmath118 .",
    "this explains @xmath119 in the main text . in the presence of perturbations represented by @xmath119 , the line",
    "node splits except at four discrete points at the @xmath2 and @xmath3 axes .",
    "we will explicitly show that these gapless points are equifrequency weyl points below .",
    "we find that the two bands cross in @xmath2 and @xmath3 axes in the presence of @xmath28 within a broad range of parameters .",
    "these gapless points survive as long as the perturbations respect @xmath120 symmetry that mentioned in the main text . for illustration",
    ", we consider the @xmath37 symmetry along the @xmath121 axis ( the space group is non - symmorphic , which is not important here ) . the @xmath120 is given by @xmath122 , where @xmath123 denotes the complex conjugation .",

    "for such a two - dimensional subsystem , a topological invariant can be defined by the first homotopy group of projector@xcite , @xmath125 . for a gapless point ( like those in @xmath2 axis as we consider ) enclosed by a topological nontrivial invariant line in such two - dimensional system",
    ", it will not disappear from @xmath124 plane unless it annihilates with another gapless point .",
    "there is another @xmath37 symmetry along the @xmath126 axis , so the gapless points will be pinned in the @xmath2 axis . for the same reason",
    ", the @xmath3 axis also possesses two gapless points .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath4 symmetry in @xmath22 group .    in order to show the weyl",
    "points explicitly , we first find the positions of gapless points .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to four positions , two at the @xmath2 axis , @xmath127 , and two at the @xmath3 axis , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "it is crucial that @xmath131 for the existence of gapless points .",
    "note that this is equivalent to @xmath132 , consistent with the analysis of line nodes above .",
    "next , we transform the original basis into the one that diagonalizes @xmath133 and then project the hamiltonian into the two bands that cross at the gapless points . after a tedious but straightforward calculation ,",

    "<S> note that when the weyl cone is not nearly isotropic , the effective refractive index is not that well - defined as there is no simple proportionality between @xmath85 and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the group velocities of the weyl cones in the modified dg can be tuned by varying @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( setting the boundary of the dielectric material ) , and the ratio of @xmath89 such that it should be feasible to realize nearly isotropic weyl cones .    </S>",
    "<S> _ frequency selectivity_. another advantage of a phc with equifrequency weyl points is high - quality frequency - selectivity . </S>",
    "<S> assume a collimated light with a broad range of frequencies , including @xmath64 , is incident onto the phc in the @xmath71 plane , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ frequency1 ] . if the incident angle @xmath90 with @xmath91 , the light with frequency in the range @xmath92 will be totally reflected , where @xmath93 assuming @xmath94 and @xmath95 , while the light with other frequencies can be partially transmitted into the phc . </S>",
    "<S> this novel property is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ frequency1 ] , where the `` green '' ray represents light in the range of @xmath92 and thus is totally reflected , while the `` blue '' and `` red '' rays represent lights with either higher or lower frequencies that can be partially transmitted into the phc . by adjusting the incident angle @xmath96 , close to @xmath97 , we can control the frequency range of total reflections . </S>",
    "<S> this controllable frequency - selectivity is of practical importance . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , mirrors , filters , and waveguides ( see fig . [ frequency2 ] ) of a particular range of frequencies can be made of photonic crystals with equifrequency weyl points . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ frequency2 ] , the partially reflected `` blue '' and `` red '' rays decay to negligible amount after a few times of reflections , while only the totally reflected `` green '' ray is trapped in the waveguide .       _ conclusion and discussions_. we have shown that a minimal number of four equifrequency weyl points can be realized in the modified time - reversal - invariant dg phc by both general symmetry analysis and the first - principle calculations of a particular modified dg phc with symmetry @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal of introducing four air spheres into each primitive cell of the dg phc is experimentally feasible . </S>",
    "<S> such topological phc with a minimal number of four equifrequency weyl points may pave the way to future applications including angular selectivity , frequency selectivity , invisibility cloaking , 3d - imaging , and large volume single mode lasers@xcite and to novel topological phenomena such as topological imbert - fedorov shift@xcite .    _ </S>",
