    "recent development in the field of molecular magnetism has produced idealized model systems that allow the investigation of quantum phenomena in nanomagnets @xcite .",
    "examples include slow relaxation in high spin molecules @xcite , quantum tunneling of the magnetization @xcite , topological quantum phase interference @xcite , and quantum coherence @xcite . within these systems , antiferromagnetic clusters , rings or triangles",
    "@xcite , have been considered for possible use in quantum computation , due to longer decoherence time as a result of weaker intercluster dipolar interactions @xcite . here",
    "we investigate a recently synthesized trinuclear cluster [ dy@xmath1(@xmath4-oh)@xmath5l@xmath1cl(h@xmath5o)@xmath6cl@xmath1  ( where l is the anion of ortho - vanillin ) @xcite , hereafter abbreviated as dy@xmath1  ( see fig . [ dy3core ] ) .",
    "the yellow , red , green and gray balls represent the dy , o , cl , and c atoms , respectively.[dy3core ] ]    this compound exhibits two important properties ; a system with a nonmagnetic ground state as well as slow relaxation of the magnetization which is typical of some high spin clusters @xcite .",
    "magnetization measurements have been explained using a model of three dy@xmath7  moments arranged on a triangle , each with a large ising anisotropy axis in the plane rotated by 120@xmath8 relative to its neighbors ( see fig .",
    "[ dy3core ] ) . a small antiferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath9 k ) between neighboring dy@xmath7  results in a nonmagnetic , @xmath10 , ground state characterized by a vortex spin - chirality .",
    "in this paper we present a zero field ( zf ) muon spin relaxation ( @xmath3sr ) study of dy@xmath1 . in this technique",
    "polarized muons are used as local spin probes of the microscopic magnetic structure of the individual dy@xmath1  molecules .",
    "we find that below @xmath0 k the local magnetic field experienced by the muons has two components , dynamic and static .",
    "the static component is direct evidence of the slow relaxation of the magnetization in the ground state of dy@xmath1 , while the dynamic component is used to measure the fluctuations time of the dy@xmath1  ground spin state directly .",
    "this is possible due to the unique local perspective of the muon .",
    "the @xmath3sr  experiments were performed on the dolly spectrometer at the paul scherrer institute , switzerland . in these experiments @xmath11 polarized ( along the beam direction , @xmath12 ) positive muons are implanted in the sample .",
    "each implanted muon decays ( lifetime @xmath13 @xmath3sec ) emitting a positron preferentially in the direction of its polarization at the time of decay .",
    "using appropriately positioned detectors , one measures the asymmetry of the muon beta decay along @xmath12 as a function of time @xmath14 , which is proportional to the time evolution of the muon spin polarization .",
    "@xmath14 depends on the distribution of internal magnetic fields and their temporal fluctuations .",
    "further details on the @xmath3sr  technique may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the composition and structure of dy@xmath1  sample was confirmed using x - ray diffraction and magnetization measurements .",
    "the powder sample was placed in a @xmath15he gas flow cryostat to measure the muon spin relaxation in the temperature range between 1.6 and 300 k. heat capacity measurements at zf and in the temperature range between 2 and 100 k were performed on the same sample using a quantum design physical properties measurement system .",
    "additionally , magnetization measurements in the same temperature range were performed using a quantum design magnetic properties measurement system .",
    "example muon spin relaxation curves measured in zf are presented in fig .",
    "note that at low temperatures , the asymmetry exhibits a dip at early times ( inset of fig .",
    "[ asy ] ) , followed by a recovery and then relaxation at longer times . in contrast , at high temperature the asymmetry relaxes almost exponentially from its initial value to zero .",
    "the low temperature relaxation curves are evidence that the internal magnetic field experienced by the implanted muons in dy@xmath1contains two contributions ; a static ( time independent ) component and a fluctuating component . as we discuss below",
    ", the static component is direct evidence of the slow relaxation of the individual dy@xmath1  ( or dy@xmath7 ) magnetic moments .    ) .",
    "[ asy ] ]    generally , when muons experience a distribution of static magnetic fields @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the average static field and @xmath18 is the root mean square of the field distribution , then the asymmetry follows a static kubo - toyabe function @xmath19 here @xmath20 mhz / t is the muon gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath21 is the angle between the initial muon spin and the local static magnetic field @xmath22 which is averaged over a powder sample .",
    "for example , if @xmath23 then the asymmetry is at its maximum value at @xmath24 , it exhibits a dip at @xmath25 and recovers to @xmath26 its initial value at long times . depending on the form of @xmath27 , e.g. gaussian or lorentzian",
    ", the relaxation follows a gaussian kubo - toyabe ( gkt ) , @xmath28 , or a lorentzian kubo - toyabe ( lkt ) , @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "however , if in addition to the static field component a small fluctuating field @xmath30 is present , then the @xmath31 tail continues to relax to zero @xcite . in this case the relaxation can be described by a phenomenological function : a lkt or gkt multiplied by a suitable dynamic relaxation function @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "the asymmetry measured in dy@xmath1  at all temperatures was found to fit best to lkt multiplied by a square root exponential relaxation , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the relaxation rate , containing information regarding the dynamics of the local field . in particular , at low temperatures where @xmath34 , @xmath14 is almost identical to the well known dynamic lkt function and hence @xmath35 @xcite , where @xmath36 is the fluctuation time of the local magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the square root exponential relaxation reflects the averaging of the relaxation behavior of muons stopping in multiple inequivalent sites @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath18 obtained from the fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ rlxdel](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .     and ( b ) @xmath18 obtained from fits of the relaxation curves as a function of temperature .",
    "[ rlxdel ] ]    note that at high temperatures @xmath33 is small and @xmath37 . as the temperature",
    "is decreased @xmath33 increases sharply while @xmath18 remains zero . at @xmath38 k , @xmath33 peaks and @xmath18 becomes non - zero",
    ". finally , at lower temperatures @xmath33 decreases again while @xmath18 saturates at @xmath39  mhz , corresponding to a width in field of @xmath40  t ( right side axis of fig .",
    "[ rlxdel](b ) ) .",
    "these temperature dependencies are commonly seen in materials undergoing magnetic ordering at @xmath41 @xcite , in such cases the increase of @xmath33 above @xmath42 is attributed to a critical slowing down of the fluctuations and @xmath18 is proportional to the order parameter ( local magnetization ) @xcite .",
    "this behavior is quite unusual , and exhibits a sharp transition from a paramagnetic to an ordered / static regime , or the sudden appearance of static magnetic fields in the system .",
    "such static fields are rarely observed in smms studied by @xmath3sr  @xcite .",
    "triggered by these findings we measured the magnetization and heat capacity to confirm that there is no evidence of long range magnetic ordering in the dy@xmath1  system .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ hc ] , bulk magnetization measurements in 50 mt show no indication of ordering at @xmath43 k @xcite .",
    "similarly , heat capacity measurements in zf show no anomalies around this temperature .",
    "therefore , the observed static fields can be associated with either ( i ) an ordering only on the _ local scale _ , e.g. the freezing ( or slowing down ) of the fluctuations of the individual dy@xmath7  magnetic moments , or ( ii ) a magnetic ground state where the dy@xmath7  moments order is such a way that they do not cancel each other , resulting in a ground state with a non - vanishing magnetic moment .",
    "the latter possibility is ruled out by bulk magnetization measurements which confirm a nonmagnetic ground state in dy@xmath1  molecules @xcite .    as a function of temperature .",
    "there is no evidence for any anomaly at 35 k. the solid lines are a guide for the eye .",
    "we start by discussing the local static field contribution and its origin . assuming that the muons occupy sites which are relatively far from the dy@xmath1  magnetic core ( i.e. at a distance much larger than the distance between different dy ions in the molecule )",
    ", one expects that at low temperatures the static dipolar field experienced by the muons will decrease and vanish as the magnetic moment of dy@xmath1  decreases at low temperature .",
    "however , since muons senses a strong non - vanishing static field at low temperatures ( up to @xmath44 t ) , we conclude that the muons occupy sites which are close to the magnetic core , and therefore are sensitive to the microscopic magnetic structure of the molecules .",
    "one such possibility is a site near the cl ion shown in fig .",
    "[ dy3core ] .",
    "this site is negatively charged and therefore may attract the positively charged implanted muons . on this site , the dipolar fields from the 3 individual dy ions do not cancel each other even if the dy@xmath7  moments are arranged in a nonmagnetic ground state configuration . instead , the dy@xmath7  closest to the cl contributes mostly to the magnetic field experienced by the muon ( roughly 20 times larger ) . for example , assuming @xmath45 is due to a dipolar field of a single dy@xmath7  moment we expect that the distance between this moment and its neighboring muon is roughly @xmath46  .",
    "this distance is similar to that between the cl mentioned above and its neighboring dy@xmath7  ( @xmath47  ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this static field is direct evidence of the slow relaxation of individual dy@xmath1  moments , which can be associated with single dy@xmath7  ion anisotropy @xcite .",
    "these measurements exhibits the power of a local probe measurement and its advantages over conventional bulk magnetization measurements in resolving the magnetic properties of individual magnetic molecules , and the microscopic magnetic structure in general .",
    "moreover , the observed local static magnetic fields , despite the nonmagnetic ground state , reflect the peculiar nature of the spin vortex arrangement and the ising / classical type interactions between the spins which give a nonmagnetic doublet , i.e. two distinct magnetic states .",
    "although muons can not detect the sense of chirality of the ground state , they provide evidence of its static magnetic nature .",
    "next , we investigate the dynamic properties of the local field experienced by the implanted muons . as we mentioned earlier , the low temperature relaxation @xmath33 can be used to extract the fluctuation time @xmath36 of the local field . in fig .",
    "[ tauvst ] we plot @xmath36 as a function of temperatures ( below @xmath48 k where @xmath49 ) .    ]",
    "we find that @xmath50 @xmath3s at @xmath51 k , increases gradually as the temperature is decreased and saturates at @xmath2 @xmath3s below @xmath52 k. these fluctuations are due to fluctuations of the dy@xmath7  magnetic moments near the stopping site of the muon . in a very simplified picture , muons are sensitive to @xmath36 only when it is shorter than the muon s lifetime ( @xmath13 @xmath3s ) .",
    "when @xmath53 we expect the muon to experience a static field component .",
    "this is consistent with the extracted values of @xmath36 ; in the range of a fraction of a @xmath3s .",
    "in contrast to this scale of dynamics , ac susceptibility measurements of the relaxation time of the magnetization at zero applied field have shown that it follows an arrhenius law @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 s and @xmath56 k. the similarity between the temperature dependence of our results and those extracted from ac susceptibility is striking .",
    "however , the low temperature saturation value of the fluctuation time is an order of magnitude longer in the ac susceptibility measurements . for comparison ,",
    "fits of @xmath36 in the range 10 - 25 k to eq .",
    "( [ arrhenius ] ) yield an activation barrier @xmath57 k and attempt time @xmath58 s ( dashed lines in fig .  [ tauvst ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy indicates that although both @xmath3sr  and ac susceptibility measurements confirm the slow relaxation of the magnetization , the scale of dynamics measured in both techniques is different .",
    "however , given that these techniques are very different and have different temporal sensitivity , there are two possible explanations of the discrepancy .",
    "one possibility is that while the dynamics measured with ac susceptibility are those of collective bulk magnetization , @xmath3sr  measures fluctuations of of _ individual _ molecules or dy@xmath7  moments within it . for example",
    ", studies in ni@xmath59 magnetic molecules have shown that while ac susceptibility exhibits slow relaxation of bulk magnetization , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements confirm the presence of fast single molecule dynamics @xcite .",
    "this was interpreted as slowing down of the bulk magnetization due to a resonant phonon trapping mechanism which prevents thermalization of the bulk magnetization but allows fast spin flipping of the individual molecular moments @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that each techniques is sensitive to a different dynamic process , which may not be even related .",
    "the dynamics of the bulk magnetization was associated to fluctuations of the dy@xmath1  magnetization in the plane of the dy@xmath7triangle .",
    "however , fluctuations out of the plane can not be ruled out .",
    "this type of fluctuations may be faster , and therefore more effective in causing muon spin lattice relaxation .",
    "we believe that nmr measurements in dy@xmath1  should be sensitive to both scales of dynamics , and therefore would provide valuable information that could clarify the discrepancy between bulk magnetization measurements and @xmath3sr .",
    "in conclusion , we find that muons implanted in dy@xmath1  observe a fluctuating field at high temperatures . below @xmath43",
    "k the local field has two components , static and dynamic .",
    "bulk magnetization and heat capacity measurements rule out the existence of long range ordering associated with the observed temperature dependence of the local field .",
    "instead , the observed static local magnetic field is direct evidence of the slow relaxation of the magnetization .",
    "our measurements exhibit that in spite of the peculiar nature of the dy@xmath7spins vortex arrangement which produces a nonmagnetic doublet , a local probe such as muons can detect their static magnetic nature .",
    "therefore , although no net magnetic moment is present , they can be used , in principle , to store magnetic information ( sense of chirality ) with the advantage of long coherence time due to the small intermolecular dipolar couplings . finally , we find that the time scale of low temperature dynamics detected with @xmath3sr  is an order of magnitude shorter than that extracted from ac susceptibility measurements",
    ". the different time scale of dynamics could be due to the sensitivity of the different techniques to different relaxation processes or a difference between fluctuations of collective individual moments .",
    "we would like to thank andreas suter for reading the manuscript and helpful discussions .",
