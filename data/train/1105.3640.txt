    "multiferroic systems have been intensively studied in the past ten years as the coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic order parameters may lead to novel electronic devices .",
    "this coupling can have different microscopic origins , related either to dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions@xcite or to an exchange - striction mechanism , and it is still not fully understood .",
    "all multiferroics show complex and mostly non collinear magnetic orders , arising from competing interactions and/or geometrical frustration .",
    "the hexagonal rmno@xmath0 compounds provide text book examples to study multiferroicity .",
    "their crystal structure consists of triangular mn planes packed along the @xmath2 axis and separated by layers of rare earth ions ( r= ho - lu ) or non magnetic ions such as y or in .",
    "as shown recently @xcite , the magnetic frustration does not arise only from the triangular geometry of antiferromagnetic ( af ) first neighbour interactions in the @xmath4 plane , but from competing interactions between mn of adjacent planes . in all compounds , the mn moments order within a triangular plane in a three sublattice nel structure , corresponding to 120@xmath5 arrangements of the mn moments in a triangle .",

    "inmno@xmath0 is the only compound which does not fit simply with the above scheme .",
    "actually , it corresponds to the peculiar situation where the mn position is very close to @xmath11=@xmath12 , so that interactions between adjacent mn planes nearly cancel .",
    "therefore one could expect new types of magnetic orders with two dimensional behavior or stabilized by further neighbour interactions .",
    "moreover the inmno@xmath0 crystal structure has the smallest lattice constant @xmath13 and the largest lattice constant @xmath2 of the series @xcite , so that in - plane and out - of - plane interactions differ much more than in the other compounds .",

    "is stabilized by near neighbour exchange interactions as well as planar and uniaxial anisotropies , so that the hamiltonian of the system is composed of three terms :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the mn spin on the @xmath83 site ,",

    "the mn position is close to the critical threshold of 1/3 for which the two exchange paths are strictly equal .",
    "this leads to a full compensation of the exchange interactions along the @xmath2 axis and to an effective out - of -plane exchange interaction close to zero .",
    "this specific position of the mn ions could explain the dynamical short range 2d order observed above t@xmath35 , and attributed to uncorrelated mn planes .",
    "the two other terms of equation ( 1 ) are respectively the planar anisotropy @xmath85 which confines the mn moments in the basal plane , and the local field @xmath88 which plays the role of a uniaxial anisotropy and selects preferential directions either along or perpendicular to the crystal axes .",
    "these terms however can not explain the long period 3d structure with @xmath52=(0 0 @xmath14 ) stabilized in inmno@xmath0 .",
    "therefore one needs to consider further neighbor interactions , with different symmetries than the exchange interactions , such as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) or the pseudo - dipolar interaction @xcite . a similar approach @xcite",
    "was proposed to account for the ordering of the yb moments in ybmno@xmath0 . in the following ,",

    "<S> inmno@xmath0 is a peculiar member of the hexagonal manganites h - rmno@xmath0 ( where r is a rare earth metal element ) , showing crystalline , electronic and magnetic properties at variance with the other compounds of the family . </S>",

    "<S> the position of the mn ions is found to be close to the threshold @xmath1 where superexchange mn - mn interactions along the @xmath2 axis compensate . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic long range order occurs below @xmath3= 120(2 )  k with a magnetic unit cell doubled along @xmath2 , whereas short range two dimensional dynamical spin correlations are observed above @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that pseudo - dipolar interactions are responsible for the long period magnetic structure . </S>"
