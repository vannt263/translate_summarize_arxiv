    "the discovery of a plethora of extra - solar planets around solar - type main sequence stars has established that planet formation must be a common process , not a peculiarity of our own solar system .",
    "as observational techniques for planetary detection have become more sophisticated , the discovery domain has expanded to include host stars with a wide range of masses . while on the main sequence , intermediate mass stars ( stars with @xmath2 ) make poor radial velocity ( rv ) survey candidates as they have few spectral lines which also tend to be rotationally broadened ( @xcite but see @xcite ) . however , once these stars evolve off the main sequence , their relatively cool and slowly rotating outer layers make them more suitable candidates for high precision spectroscopic studies .",
    "recent rv surveys targeting evolved intermediate mass stars suggest that they differ from solar - type stars as planetary hosts in at least two respects .",
    "first , the total frequency of giant planets ( with periods less than a few years ) appears be higher around intermediate mass stars .",
    "second , the planets have different statistical properties . their semi - major axis distribution is concentrated at 1 - 2 au and there is an apparent lack of short - period ( days to months ) planets , despite observational selection effects favoring their discovery @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a common explanation for prolific gas giant formation with semi - major axes comparable to 1  au and for the rarity of close - in planets around intermediate - mass stars . as it is unlikely that all planets within 1 au have been engulfed or had their orbits disrupted by the current expanded envelope of the host stars @xcite , we attribute both properties to the formation and early evolutionary processes rather than to post - main - sequence evolution .    we begin by examining the physical properties of circumstellar disks which may affect the probability of forming giant planets . in the core - accretion model of planet formation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the emergence of jupiter - like gas giants requires that a population of solid cores form within a gaseous protoplanetary disk .",
    "these cores grow through cohesive collisions with planetesimals , with a growth rate determined by the velocity dispersion of the planetesimal swarm .",
    "the magnitude of this velocity dispersion is set by a balance between excitation by gravitational perturbations and damping by gas drag . in the gas - rich environment of typical protostellar disk ,",
    "gas drag dominates so that field planetesimals only attain relatively small equilibrium velocity dispersion . as a result",
    "the most massive protoplanetary embryos can access only those building blocks within their gravitational feeding zones @xcite . when these embryos have collected all the planetesimals within about five times their roche radius on either side of their orbits , their growth stalls .",
    "this maximum embryo mass , a function of planetesimal surface density and distance from the central star , is referred to as the embryo s isolation mass ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "gas giants can only form if the embryos @xmath3 is sufficiently large for the cores to begin accreting gas prior to the depletion of their nascent disks @xcite .    although the gravity of lunar - mass embryos is adequate to accrete disk gas with temperature @xmath4 k , _ efficient _ dynamical gas accretion is only possible for cores with masses greater than some critical value ( @xmath5 ) . in a minimum mass solar nebula @xcite with an interstellar grain size distribution , @xmath6 at a semi - major axis @xmath7  au @xcite , although this critical mass decreases both with lowered grain opacity @xcite and with increased density of the ambient gas @xcite .",
    "gas giant formation therefore requires that the heavy - elements in the disk can be efficiently assembled into massive cores with mass greater than @xmath5 . in order to understand the spatial distribution of the gas giant planets",
    "we must understand how the building blocks of these cores migrate and are retained in gaseous disks .    in protoplanetary disks",
    "solid retention first becomes an issue once grains grow beyond a few cm in size . in most regions of protostellar disks ,",
    "the midplane pressure ( @xmath8 ) decreases with distance from the central star ( @xmath9 ) so that the gas is slightly pressure supported , resulting in a sub - keplerian azimuthal velocity .",
    "grains larger than a few cm are decoupled from the gas and move at keplerian speeds .",
    "consequently , grains typically experience head winds and undergo orbital decay @xcite .",
    "however if @xmath10 does not monotonically decrease with @xmath9 then immediately interior to a local pressure maximum the gas attains super - keplerian velocities .",
    "this motion introduces a tail wind on the decoupled grains and causes them to drift outwards towards local pressure maxima @xcite .",
    "solid retention again becomes an issue once planetesimals grow into earth - mass embryos and tidal interactions with the gaseous disk become important . before embryos are sufficiently massive to open up gaps in the disks @xcite , they can exchange angular momentum with the gas via their lindblad and co - rotation resonances @xcite .",
    "a geometric bias causes an imbalance between the lindblad resonances which generally leads to a loss of angular momentum and orbital decay for the embryos @xcite .",
    "however , embryos will gain angular momentum through their co - rotation resonances if there is a positive @xmath10 gradient @xcite .",
    "numerical models which take into account these physical effects have reproduced the observed @xmath11 distribution around solar type stars @xcite .",
    "several physical processes can lead to local maxima in @xmath10 .",
    "various authors have explored the potential accumulation of grains at transient pressure maxima formed by turbulent fluctuations @xcite or spiral waves @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms , while likely extremely important for forming planetesimals at a large range of radii , are still quite `` leaky '' as a significant fraction of the solid material simply undergoes a slightly slower random walk towards the central star .",
    "however , longer lived pressure maxima may also exist due to large scale changes in the disk viscosity @xcite .",
    "we expect radial variations in viscosity if turbulence caused by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) is the primary mechanism for transporting angular momentum .",
    "these variations result from changes in the ionization fraction at different radii in the disk since free electrons are needed to couple the gas to the magnetic field .",
    "the disk is thermally ionized in the hot inner regions , but further out stellar x - rays and diffuse cosmic rays ionize only the surface layers , resulting in a viscously active turbulent surface sandwiching an inactive `` dead zone '' @xcite . at the critical radius marking the inner edge of the dead zone ( @xmath12 ) , the effective viscosity decreases with increasing distance from the central star . in a quasi - steady state situation ( expected to develop rapidly in the inner regions of the disk ) this decrease in viscosity leads to a local increase in the magnitude of @xmath13 and hence of @xmath10 with radius .",
    "this disk structure provides a promising barrier to the orbital decay of both boulders and embryos .",
    "the radial location of @xmath12 depends on the stellar mass and the mass accretion rate which we argue explains the observed differences between the statistical distributions of planets around solar - type stars and around intermediate mass stars .    in this paper , we present a model for the formation of planets at the inner edge of the dead zone and argue why this process is more relevant for intermediate mass than for solar mass stars . in @xmath14[sec : model ] we describe our quantitative numerical model for the evolution of solids in the disk , based upon the work of @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of this model is the location of @xmath12 ( the inner edge of the dead zone ) which we derive in @xmath14[sec : acrit ] as a function of stellar mass and mass accretion rate . in @xmath14[sec : results ] we present the model results for a @xmath15 star and estimate how this planet formation mechanism scales with stellar mass . in @xmath14[sec : summary ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in order to assess the probability of forming of gas giants at the inner edge of the dead zone , we must calculate the expected isolation mass of the cores ( @xmath3 ) at this location ( @xmath12 ) . from the work of @xcite",
    ", it has been established that the embryo s isolation mass is sensitive both to the distance from the host star and to the surface density of solids .",
    "for the purpose of computing the efficiency of solid retention we calculate the dynamical evolution of the solids in the disk using a modification of the numerical scheme developed by @xcite ( hereafter g07 ) . for full details",
    "we refer the readers to g07 but for reference the salient points are described here . in this model",
    "we assume that particles , as a result of a collisional cascade , maintain a power - law size distribution in which the number density of particles of size @xmath16 goes as @xmath17 , with sizes ranging from a fixed @xmath18 to @xmath19 and where @xmath19 is allowed to vary with time and distance from the central star .",
    "this simplifying assumption allows us to completely describe the evolution of the gas and solids in the disk by the total gas surface density ( @xmath20 ) , the solid and vapor surface densities of the different species in the disk ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively ) , and the maximum size of the particles @xmath23 .    in the following sections we describe how we have modified the g07 scheme . in ",
    "[ sec : vis ] , we describe how we account for the presence of an evolving dead zone . in particular we describe in  [ sec : acrit ] how we calculate the location of the inner edge of the dead zone ( @xmath12 ) using a simple model of the vertical thermal structure .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : feedback ] we model the drag on the gas caused by the particles in the limit of large @xmath24 , an effect important near @xmath12 where solids are seen to accumulate .",
    "the original g07 model uses the standard @xmath26 viscosity prescription ( @xmath27 ) where @xmath28 is the midplane sound - speed , @xmath29 is the disk scale - height ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 is constant . in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath32 to model the presence of an evolving mri - dead zone . in",
    "fully mri - active regions ( eg .",
    "interior to @xmath12 ) we assume that @xmath33 , while exterior to @xmath12 , @xmath31 is modified to take into account the lower viscosity of the dead zone . in  [ sec : acrit ] we describe in detail how we calculate the location of @xmath12 .",
    "exterior to @xmath12 the disk is ionized by x - rays and cosmic rays , so only the surface layers are mri active .",
    "the column density of this active layer ( @xmath34 ) is strongly dependent on the ionizing source ( ie . the ability of cosmic rays to penetrate the stellar magnetosphere ) and on the recombination rate , which is dominated by the amount of small grains . due to these uncertainties , and",
    "the fact that the exact evolution of the outer parts of the dead zone are relatively unimportant in these calculations , we follow previous studies and assume that @xmath35  g @xmath36 at all radii ( outside of the thermally ionized region ) ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "additionally , we assume that there is some amount of angular momentum transport in the dead zone .",
    "this transport may be due to the propagation of mri - driven waves into the laminar dead zone ( @xcite ) or to a mechanism unrelated to the mri .",
    "this motivates the following prescription in regions beyond @xmath12 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the effective viscosity in the dead zone .      as the degree of thermal",
    "ionization is a sensitive function of temperature , we must calculate the vertical structure of the disk in order to find the location of @xmath12 , the inner edge of the dead zone . in the innermost regions of the disk viscous heating",
    "dominates the energy budget , and stellar irradiation can be neglected @xcite .",
    "we assume that the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath39 and is viscously heated so that the vertical energy flux ( @xmath40 ) is described by @xmath41 here we consider that @xmath42 is a function of both height and radius in the disk and assume that the orbital frequency can be approximated by the keplerian frequency .",
    "we also assume radiative energy transport so that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "for the temperature range of interest ( 400 - 1,200k ) the dominant opacity sources are silicate and iron grains .",
    "we adopt a grey opacity approximation in which @xmath45 .",
    "this approximation is consistent with the @xcite dust opacities .",
    "we solve only the optically thick region of the disk and use photospheric boundary conditions at @xmath46 , namely @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "finally we assume symmetry about the midplane .    in order to parametrize the variation of the viscosity with height above the midplane",
    "we follow the results of 3d mhd simulations which demonstrate that , in fully developed mri - turbulence , the shear stress(@xmath49 ) is approximately constant with height @xcite .",
    "based on these numerical results , we model the viscosity at a given radius as @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "note that this differs from the more common 2d parametrization sometime referred to as the `` @xmath52-formalism '' ( e.g. @xcite ) where @xmath53 .",
    "viscosity described by equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) increases with height , which leads to a cooler midplane more consistent with multi - dimensional mhd simulations than the @xmath52-formalism @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) is applicable to mri - active regions where the partially ionized gas is well coupled to the turbulent magnetic field through the entire thickness of the disk . as long as the midplane temperature is high enough to sufficiently ionize the gas this structure is self - consistent .",
    "we can therefore use it to determine @xmath12 , the outermost radius where this condition is satisfied . in practice",
    "we combine the equations for the vertical structure with the saha equation to calculate the location at which the midplane just satisfies the ionization criteria of @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the fractional number density of electrons ) which corresponds to @xmath56k for typical disk midplane densities @xcite .    in figure [ acrit ]",
    "the curves show the location of the inner edge of the dead zone as a function of stellar mass and accretion rate assuming that in the active region @xmath57 .",
    "these theoretical curves can be approximated by @xmath58 where the quasi - steady - state approximation for the mass accretion rate @xmath59 was used to eliminate @xmath10 .",
    "we find that this value for @xmath12 varies significantly from the @xmath60  au often quoted ( ie .",
    "@xcite ) if the stellar mass or the mass accretion rate are large . by using the relationship",
    "@xmath61 @xcite we can relate the @xmath26 in equation ( [ eq : acrit ] ) to the the vertically averaged @xmath31 when the disk is fully mri active and find that @xmath62 .",
    "observationally , @xmath63 appears to be correlated with @xmath64 , although the exact relationship is both uncertain and shows significant scatter . for reference",
    "the symbols in figure 2 indicate measurements of mass accretion rates onto young stars .",
    "the solid points are from observations of the young cluster ( @xmath65 1 myr ) @xmath66-oph by @xcite and the dashed line shows the best fit to their data which is @xmath67 as the mass accretion rate for the higher mass stars in the natta et al .",
    "sample is dominated by a single object , we have also plotted ( as open points ) similar data from older , heterogeneously distributed intermediate mass stars with estimated ages ranging from 1 - 10  myr @xcite . as suggested in this study ,",
    "these systematically older stars may have had higher mass accretion rates consistent with the extrapolation from @xmath66-oph , when they were younger .",
    "using the best fit relationship from @xmath66-oph implies that @xmath68 .",
    "@xcite suggest that the correlation between stellar mass and mass accretion rate may not be this steep due to observational biases .",
    "if instead we use their estimation that @xmath69 , then @xmath70 , which is a slightly less sensitive but nevertheless increasing function of @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , in the light of these the uncertainties , we will simply assume that @xmath71 .      in a thin disk , the global evolution of the gas surface density @xmath13",
    "is determined by the equation @xmath72 in a standard viscous accretion disk the radial velocity ( @xmath73 ) of gas equals @xmath74 where @xmath75 in our analysis , we consider the possibility that the radial velocity of the gas @xmath73 is not only determined by the viscosity but also by momentum transferred via drag between the gas and the solid particles .",
    "we calculate the equation of motion for a parcel of gas and dust in a similar fashion to @xcite . however , instead of assuming a single particle size for the solids we consider the power - law distribution ( @xmath76 ) .",

    "this relatively massive disk is still stable according to the toomre criterion at all radii . for simplicity we only track one species of solids , a generic refractory material which we take to be a combination of silicates and metals , materials which are assumed to sublimate at 1500k .",

    "we present two runs , the first neglecting momentum transfer from the dust to the gas and then including this feedback .",
    "the top and middle panels of figure [ fig : sigma ] show the evolution of the gas and solids neglecting the feedback of the dust on the gas . for reference ,",
    "figure [ fig : alpha ] shows @xmath31 at @xmath120 years and at @xmath121 years to indicate the location of the dead zone . early on the dead zone extends from 0.9 to 20 au , but as the disk evolves the dead zone shrinks . within the first @xmath120 years the gaseous disk adjusts to a quasi - steady - state profile in the inner regions .",
    "the surface density of the gas in the fully mri - active inner region ( @xmath122 1 au ) is reduced by a factor of @xmath123 compared with that in the dead zone ( @xmath124 $ ] au ) , thus creating a local pressure maximum near 1 au . in this calculation neglecting feedback , the solids accumulate in a very narrow ring corresponding to this pressure maximum . after only @xmath125 years",
    "the largest - size body at this location reaches @xmath126 and the core thus formed is expected to continue to grow significantly due to accretion of gas , not included in this numerical calculation .",
    "crucially , in this model tidal interactions will not affect the orbital evolution of the core as the effect of type i migration would be to keep the core at the pressure maximum @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that when feedback is neglected , virtually all solids are trapped at the pressure maximum and negligible amounts of heavy elements accrete onto the star .",
    "this effect is associated with the clear spatial separation of the pressure maximum and the sublimation line ( here at @xmath127 0.3 au ) and would appear to predict that intermediate - mass stars should be strongly depleted in refractory elements .",
    "however we now show that this is in fact unrealistic as the large build up of material makes it necessary to include the transfer of momentum from the solids to the gas .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ fig : sigma ] show the evolution of the same initial disk including this momentum feedback .",
    "the early evolution is essentially similar for @xmath128 yrs .",
    "however , once the amount of solids in the inner edge of the dead zone has increased by an order of magnitude , it begins affecting the gas properties ( compare the middle and bottom panels of fig [ fig : sigma ] ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the star decreases as the gas receives angular momentum from the solids .",
    "the decrease in @xmath63 reduces the surface density and thus the midplane temperature , causing @xmath12 to move inwards . as @xmath12 moves inwards",
    "the particles of different sizes respond to this shift in location at different rates , smoothing the sharp peak in the solid surface density and allowing the trapped gasses to accrete onto the central star . in this way",
    "both @xmath63 and the position of @xmath12 oscillate with time as seen in figure [ fig : mdot ] .",
    "it is also interesting to note that these oscillations allow heavy elements to accrete onto the star since when @xmath12 moves outwards it leaves some solids interior to the `` trap '' of the pressure maximum .",
    "thus intermediate - mass stars will not , in fact , be significantly depleted in refractory elements . in these simulations we find that the total amount of solids trapped near the pressure maximum is of the order of 100 @xmath129 and that the dust - to - gas ratio in this region is of order unity . the core growth is slower than in the simulation without feedback as material",
    "is deposited over a wider range of radii . in @xmath130",
    "yrs the largest body has grown to @xmath131 but the amount of material in its vicinity suggests that it will continue to grow larger still .",
    "as the core mass increases much beyond 0.5 @xmath129 many effects not included in the numerical algorithm could affect its growth .",
    "for example , it may be important to include the effects of tidal interactions since the oscillations of the position of the pressure maximum could affect the orbital evolution of the core .",
    "additionally , gravitational interactions between solids may start to impact their radial distribution .",
    "the cores may scatter each other out of the region of interest and radially migrating solids will be trapped into resonances with the existing core , stalling radial migration @xcite . as a result",
    ", we do not continue integrating the simulations beyond this point but instead estimate the achievable core mass with simpler but robust scalings based on our most important results from the previous section : ( 1 ) the presence of a large reservoir of solids ( @xmath132 ) around @xmath12 and ( 2 ) the saturation of the dust - to - gas surface density ratio to @xmath133 near @xmath12 ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] ) , which is a simple consequence of the saturation of the nonlinear momentum feedback between the solids and the gas .",

    "we assume that @xmath13 is related to @xmath63 by the quasi - steady - state approximation ( [ eq : mdot_general ] ) , and that @xmath137 is related to the gas density via @xmath24 where @xmath133 .",
    "we find that @xmath138 note that this estimate should be considered as a maximum achievable size and that , more realistically , cores may only reach a fraction of @xmath3 .",

    ", we estimate that @xmath160    figure 2 shows that the dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath158 in equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) is an average relation with considerable dispersion .",
    "furthermore , @xmath63 declines with the stellar age @xmath161 . within our model planets with larger @xmath143 on longer period orbits can form during the early epochs of disk evolution when @xmath63 is much larger and @xmath12 is correspondingly further out .",

    "once the first planet has formed and grown large enough to open a gap , the outer edge of this gap provides another pressure maximum capable of trapping solids and promoting the formation of the next planet ( @xcite ) .",
    "we anticipate a prolific production of multiple planetary systems for intermediate - mass stars .",
    "while planets are likely to form by the same basic mechanisms regardless of the environment in which they form , the properties of their host stars and the detailed structure of their nascent disks will strongly affect the statistical outcome of the formation process .",
    "observations hint that planets may form systematically more efficiently around intermediate mass stars , and that there is a statistically significant lack of giant planets on orbits with semi - major axes much smaller than 1 au . in this paper",
    "we propose a mechanism which forms giant planets preferentially around intermediate mass stars with radial distributions roughly consistent with these observations . in this model",
    "the gaseous protoplanetary disk evolves due to mri - driven turbulence , creating a pressure maximum at the inner edge of the dead zone ( @xmath12 ) which traps solid material . in order for the cores formed at this location to grow large enough to seed giant planets",
    ", the inner edge of the dead zone must be sufficiently far from the host star .",
    "we demonstrate that , as @xmath12 is roughly proportional to @xmath64 , this condition is only likely to be met around intermediate mass stars .",
    "the amount of solids which accumulates near @xmath12 is limited by momentum feedback on the gas by the solids .",
    "this is interesting as it means that the surface density of solids at @xmath12 depends on the gas surface density and _ not _ on the initial fraction of solids , except in extremely metal poor disks .",
    "this suggests that while there may be a critical metallicity required in order to form planets by the mechanism described in this paper , beyond that critical value the frequency of giant planets should depend only weakly on stellar metallicity .",
    "the prolific production of gas giants near @xmath12 can also promote the emergence of additional gas giants at larger distances from the same host stars .",
    "we may expect the fraction of intermediate - mass stars with multiple jupiter - mass planets is likely to be larger than that around solar - type stars .",
    "nevertheless , we anticipate the peak in the planets semi - major axis distribution to be around 1 au .",
    "this corresponds to the location of the original pressure maximum at the inner edge of the dead zone .",
    "quantitative verification of this expectation requires population synthesis which will be carried out and presented elsewhere .",
    "observational confirmation of this peaked period distribution will provide clues and constraints on the outstanding issue of magnetic turbulent transport in protostellar disks .    acknowledgments .",
