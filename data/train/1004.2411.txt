    "with increasing capabilities to synthesize nanoparticles with a wide variety in compositions , shapes and sizes there has been an increasing interest in how these properties influence the behavior of the bulk material .",
    "understanding what nanoparticle properties most strongly influence the bulk behavior and to what extent the bulk properties vary can provide a significant advantage in a number of industries that process powders , suspensions , and solutions containing nanoscale particles .",
    "one such property is the shape of the nanoparticle which even in naturally occurring materials can vary drastically from elongated rods to near perfect spheres or amorphous blobs . to",
    "what extent do these various shapes impact the rheology of nanoparticle suspensions ? how much of a difference in nanoparticle shape is required to use tailored nanoparticle shapes as viscosity modifiers ?",
    "we address these questions by simulating the rheological behavior of suspensions of nanoparticles with different shapes .",
    "multiple approaches have been used to study the rheology of suspensions including brownian dynamics,@xcite dissipative particle dynamics,@xcite and stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd).@xcite almost all of these approaches treat the nanoparticles as perfectly spherical particles in either an implicit solvent or an explicit solvent consisting of spherical particles . for srd ,",
    "the implicit solvent particles are treated as point masses .",
    "some work has been done using quadrupoles to describe suspensions of platelets representing clay particles instead of spheres@xcite but this approach does not allow for a wide range of particle shapes .",
    "others have described particles of arbitrary shapes using composites of sub - particles held together as rigid @xcite or flexible bodies@xcite .",
    "this is the approach we use here to study the effect of nanoparticle shape on suspension rheology for the four nanoparticle shapes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singsnap ] .",
    "in addition , we also consider how the introduction of charge on the nanoparticle affects their suspension rheology in the presence of both low and high salt solutions .",

    "we also describe the techniques used to simulate the equilibrium and sheared systems . in section [ sec : structure ]",
    "we present our results for the equilibrium structure and diffusion coefficient for nanoparticle suspensions for the four nanoparticle shapes .",
    "we determine the relationship between the diffusion coefficient and ionic strength for charged spheres and jacks as we approach the no salt limit .",
    "results for the orientational order parameter for rods and plates for different ionic strength are also presented . in section [ sec : rheology ] we present results for the viscosity of the sheared suspensions .",
    "a brief summary of our results and conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "nanoparticles in the shape of rods , plates , jacks and spheres were each modeled as rigid composites of 135 interaction sites each of mass @xmath7 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singsnap ] . the uncharged double wide jacks discussed here as well as extended jacks consisting of single row of interaction sites",
    "have previously been studied by petersen et al.@xcite the background solvent consists of lennard - jones particles of mass @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction potential for both the solvent and nanoparticle sites is the lennard - jones ( lj ) 6 - 12 potential , @xmath8 & r\\leq r_{c } \\\\   0 & r > r_{c }    \\end{array}\\right.\\label{eq : ljpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the lj units of energy and length and are the same for both the nanoparticle interaction sites and the solvent .",
    "the solvent - solvent and solvent - nanoparticle site interactions were cutoff at @xmath11 while the nanoparticle - nanoparticle site interactions were cutoff at @xmath12 . the shorter cutoff for the nanoparticle - nanoparticle site interaction results in a purely repulsive , short range interaction between nanoparticles , thereby promoting nanoparticle dispersion .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated with a velocity - verlet algorithm with a time step @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the density of the nanoparticles was nominally the same as that of the background solvent to avoid the consideration of sedimentation .",
    "the rigid - body motion was determined by the forces on the nanoparticle s composite sites .",
    "these forces produced center - of - mass translation and rotation about the nanoparticle center - of - mass .",
    "all of the simulations for the uncharged systems were carried out at a nanoparticle volume fraction of @xmath0 .",
    "this volume fraction was chosen since it was large enough that the suspension viscosity @xmath15 was measurably larger than that of the solvent viscosity , @xmath16,@xcite and low enough that at least for the uncharged systems the nanoparticles were in their isotropic phase .",
    "although each shape is composed of the same number of sub - particles , the surface area and hydrodynamic radius varies for each type , thus giving rise to shape - dependent rheological behavior .",
    "the effect of introducing charge on the nanoparticles was also studied by adding a dlvo interaction between all interactions sites on the nanoparticles , @xmath17 where the prefactor a is set to @xmath18 and the cutoff is at @xmath19 .",
    "we compare high screening and low screening to the no charge case for all four systems by setting the inverse debye length to @xmath20 for the high screening case and @xmath21 for the low screening case .",
    "these values correspond to debye lengths of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , where @xmath24 is the diameter of the spherical composite particle . upon adding the charges to each system ,",
    "we re - equilibrate the system volume using a nose / hoover barostat which leads to a slight increase in the system volume . on average ,",
    "the volume increases by 1% for @xmath20 and by 3% for @xmath21 .",
    "for the spheres and jacks , we also simulated larger values of @xmath25 to explore the crossover to the limit of no salt ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "it should be noted that although the dlvo potential provides an accurate representation of the forces between charged particles at large separations , the theory does not take into account the distortion of the electrical double - layer that becomes significant when a pair of particles come within two debye lengths of each other .",
    "we do nt expect this to be a severe limitation for our dilute solutions , but it will contribute some quantitative error when comparing these results to that for real particle suspensions .",
    "given the elongation of the jacks and rods , these two systems require a larger simulation cell @xmath27 than for the spheres and plates to avoid any issues related to the finite simulation size .",
    "the system sizes and number of particles in each system are summarized in table [ tab : size ] .",
    "each simulation uses periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "the temperature is maintained at @xmath28 using a langevin thermostat with damping constant @xmath29 .",
    "for shear simulations , the thermostat is applied only in the direction perpendicular to the bulk flow and shear directions .",
    ".simulation box length @xmath27 and number of solvent particles ( @xmath30 ) and number of nanoparticles ( @xmath31 ) for the four nanoparticle shapes [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     the influence of shear flow on the orientation of these systems is shown in figure [ fig : p2shear ] where we plot s as a function of shear rate for the charged plates and rods .",
    "in general , shear does not induce ordering of the particle suspensions over this range of shear rates except for the highly screened plates at shear rates above @xmath32 and a slight increase for the highly screened rods .",
    "others@xcite have shown that nemd simulations of colloidal suspensions can produce shear induced ordering under steady shear and that the effect is dependent on the simulated system size , indicating that it is an artefact of the simulation and not a real phenomenon .",
    "however , the shear rates shown in figure [ fig : p2shear ] correspond to deborah numbers ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 . in this range ,",
    "artificial shear induced ordering is found to occur only at reduced temperatures below about @xmath35 where @xmath36.@xcite the reduced temperature for each of our simulations is @xmath37 , so we expect that the ordering shown in figure [ fig : p2shear ] is not an artefact of the nemd simulation approach .",

    "molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the rheology of nanoparticle suspensions for particle shapes of jacks , rods , plates , and spheres both charged and uncharged .",
    "we analyze the equilibrium structure of each system and find that the rod and plate systems show noticeable particle alignment which helps to minimize the frequency of particle collisions .",
    "we expect that even more ordering in the rod and plate systems would occur at higher concentrations .",
    "in addition , higher concentrations of jacks have exhibited enhanced viscosity@xcite previous studies of spheres have found crystallization at volume fractions starting around @xmath38.@xcite the particle diffusivity is significantly higher for the spherical particles than for all other particle shapes for both charged and uncharged particles .",
    "we also consider the response of each particle type to imposed shear .",
    "the viscosities of the uncharged systems are most sensitive to the ability of the particles to align under shear with the jack system having a significantly higher viscosity than the other particle shapes .",
