    "the thomas - fermi model is one of the simplest approaches to the study of the potential and charge densities in a variety of systems , like , for example , atoms@xcite , molecules@xcite , atoms in strong magnetic fields@xcite , metals and crystals@xcite and dense plasmas@xcite .",
    "for this reason there has been great interest in the accurate calculation of the solution to the thomas - fermi equation@xcite .",
    "in particular the accurate results obtained by kobayashi et al@xcite by numerical integration are commonly chosen as benchmark data for testing other approaches .",
    "the even more accurate results of rijnierse do not appear to be so well known , probably because they do not appear to have been published and are only quoted in the book by torrens@xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the solution to the nonlinear thomas - fermi equation depends on the slope at the origin .",
    "the critical slope at the origin suitable for neutral atoms is of particular interest and has been estimated by many authors ( see , for example , kobayashi et al@xcite ) .",
    "particularly accurate results for this critical slope were obtained by amore and fernndez@xcite and later by fernndez@xcite using the pad - hankel method ( phm ) .",
    "abbasbandy and bervillier@xcite considerably improved this estimate by means of a judicious analytic continuation of the expansion of the solution about the origin and boyd@xcite reported an even more accurate result obtained by means of a rational chebyshev series .",
    "other authors have also resorted to pad approximants in order to approximate the solution to the thomas - fermi equation@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a method due to majorama is suitable for obtaining a semi - analytical series solution to the thomas - fermi equation in terms of only one quadrature@xcite .",
    "the analytic properties of the solution of the thomas - fermi equation under different boundary conditions ( in addition to the physically relevant ones ) are also of great interest and have been studied by several authors ( see , for example , hille@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we want to stress the different behaviour of the solution of the thomas - fermi equation for atoms and atoms in strong magnetic fields that was overlooked in a recent application of the phm@xcite .",
    "more precisely , in his application of the phm fernndez@xcite assumed the incorrect asymptotic behaviour at infinity suggested by banerjee et al@xcite .",
    "however , since the phm does not take into account the second ( outer ) boundary condition explicitly fernndez obtained an accurate slope at the origin .",
    "the phm is based on the riccati - pad method that was developed to obtain bound states and resonances of separable quantum - mechanical problems@xcite .",
    "our second goal is to show that the available computer - algebra software enable one to solve the thomas - fermi equations ( and , certainly , other nonlinear equations as well ) with great accuracy .",
    "we want to provide sufficiently accurate solutions that may be used as benchmark data for testing future analytical or numerical methods .",
    "boyd@xcite obtained the most accurate critical slope at the origin of the solution to the thomas - fermi equation for neutral atoms by means of rational chebyshev series . in this paper",
    "we try the chebyshev polynomials on the equation for neutral atoms in very strong magnetic fields .    in section [ sec :",
    "expansions ] we outline the expansions of the solution to the thomas - fermi equation about origin , at infinity , about poles and zeroes / branch points .",
    "such expansions have already been discussed by other authors and also used as aids for obtaining approximate analytical solutions as well as accurate numerical results@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to stress the difference between the thomas - fermi equations for isolated atoms and atoms in strong magnetic fields . in section [ sec : phm ]",
    "we describe the accurate results obtained by means of the phm and from straightforward integration of the differential equations . in sec .",

    "[ sec : cheb_2 ] we consider analytical results based such polynomials of small degree .",

    "sec : conclusions ] we draw conclusions .",
    "in order to facilitate the discussion and to make this paper clearer in this section we summarize the well known expansions of the thomas - fermi equations about some characteristic points . as indicated above ,",
    "such expansions are well known and have been widely used by other authors for several different purposes@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simplest cases .",
    "the first one is the thomas - fermi equation for an atom @xmath0 it can be expanded about origin as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the unknown slope at the origin .",

    "the solution increases and tends to infinity because of a movable singularity at @xmath16 about which it behaves as @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "abbasbandy and bervillier@xcite derived an alternative and more detailed expansion in terms of the variable @xmath19 for the function @xmath20 .",
    "it is also well known that @xmath21 as @xmath22 from the left and @xmath23 as @xmath24 from the right . at this limit",
    "the solution tends monotonically to zero according to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant .",
    "there have been reasonably successful attempts at matching the expansions ( [ eq : tf_origin ] ) and ( [ eq : tf_infinity ] ) by means of appropriate nonlinear transformations of the independent variable@xcite .    from a physical point of view the zero at @xmath7 ( see the expansion ( [ eq : tf_zero ] ) ) is the radio of an atom if @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of electrons , @xmath29 is the atomic number and @xmath30 is the degree of ionization ( note that @xmath31 ) . for a neutral atom ( @xmath32 ) the boundary condition @xmath33 takes place at @xmath34 as indicated above for the case @xmath35 .",
    "abbasbandy and bervillier@xcite argued that the phm applies successfully to this problem because the hankel condition sends the movable singularity at @xmath16 to infinity .",
    "the thomas - fermi equation for an atom in a strong magnetic field is ( tomishina and yonei@xcite proposed a somewhat more realistic model that we do not discuss here ) @xmath36 in this case the expansion about the origin is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 . as in the preceding case",

    "the location of the minimum @xmath50 approaches @xmath51 from below as @xmath4 approaches @xmath3 from above .",
    "the zero / branch point @xmath52 also approaches @xmath53 from below as @xmath54 approaches @xmath3 from below .",
    "however , the function is analytic at @xmath47 when @xmath46 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tff_crit ] ) .",
    "the solution with the critical slope at the origin also tends to infinity as @xmath55 according to equation ( [ eq : tff_infinity ] ) .",
    "according to banerjee et al@xcite the universal solution corresponding to neutral atoms ( @xmath56 ) satisfies @xmath57 and @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "based on this conjecture fernndez@xcite applied the phm and obtained a somewhat more accurate value of @xmath3 .",
    "however hill et al@xcite showed that @xmath53 is finite and can be related to @xmath52 by means of a perturbation expansion of the form .",
    "@xmath60 which clearly shows that @xmath52 approaches @xmath53 from below as @xmath61 ( and @xmath24 from below ) .",
    "they confirmed this result by numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tff_eq ] ) .    in the two cases discussed above the phm yields the correct critical slope at the origin disregarding the second boundary condition . in the first example both @xmath62 and @xmath63 vanish as @xmath55 , while in the second example they vanish at a finite value @xmath53 of the independent variable .",
    "abbasbandy and bervillier@xcite suggested that the success of the phm is based on `` forcing the localization at infinity of a movable singularity ( when it exists ) '' .",
    "they also stated that `` if the second boundary is located at infinity , the phm has a particular significance '' .",
    "the success of the phm for the thomas - fermi equation ( [ eq : tff_eq ] ) shows that the approach is also suitable when the second boundary condition takes place at a finite point . in this case",
    "the movable singularity pushed to infinity may be the zero / branch point @xmath52 discussed above ( eq .  ( [ eq : tff_zero ] ) ) .",
    "it was shown that @xmath52 approaches @xmath53 as @xmath4 approaches the critical slope but it may jump to infinity when @xmath46 leaving the solution analytic at @xmath53 as discussed above .",
    "we can not prove this conjecture rigorously but we believe that it sounds plausible .",
    "we first review the main points of the phm . following amore and",
    "fernndez@xcite we choose the new variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the function @xmath66 can be expanded in a taylor series @xmath67 where the coefficients @xmath68 , @xmath69 depend on @xmath70 .",
    "we construct the hankel determinants @xmath71 that depend on the unknown slope at the origin @xmath72 and obtain sequences of roots @xmath73 $ ] of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , ( @xmath76 fixed ) that converge towards the critical slope .",
    "we carried out phm calculations for values of @xmath77 greater than those used before@xcite and also numerical integration based commands built in mathematica together with the bisection method .",
    "we describe the results in what follows .",
    "there are far too many results for the critical slope of the solution to the thomas - fermi equation for neutral atoms .",
    "table  [ tab : tf_crit ] just shows the most accurate ones .",
    "present phm result was estimated from sequences of roots of the hankel determinants with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the thomas - fermi equation for a neutral atom in a strong magnetic field has not been so widely studied .",
    "table  [ tab : tff_crit ] shows the available critical slopes at origin .",
    "present phm result was estimated by comparing results with @xmath78 and @xmath80 .",
    "the phm exhibits a much greater rate of convergence for this problem .    in order to provide benchmark data for testing other approaches in the future we have calculated @xmath62 and @xmath63 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : tf_eq ] ) and @xmath62 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : tff_eq ] ) as accurately as possible using straightforward numerical integration . in principle",
    ", we can resort to the analytical behaviour of the solutions described in section [ sec : expansions ] in order to bracket the slope at origin @xmath81 with any desired accuracy .",
    "however , in the present case we have remarkably accurate values of the critical slope at origin obtained by other methods and , therefore , we proceeded in a different way that we describe in what follows .",
    "a sufficiently accurate value of the slope at origin for the thomas - fermi equation obtained in this paper is @xmath82 .",
    "we calculated the values of @xmath62 and @xmath83 by means of the command nsdolve built in mathematica with different accuracy choices to test the precision of the numerical results .",
    "we tried three sets of parameters :    * case i : workingprecision=300 ; precisiongoal=20;accuracygoal=20 ; * case ii : workingprecision=1000 ; precisiongoal=50;accuracygoal=50 ; * case iii : workingprecision=1000 ; precisiongoal=60;accuracygoal=60 ;    and carried out the numerical integration through the interval @xmath84 .",
    "in addition to the straightforward comparison of the results for those three sets it is also necessary to determine the effect of the error due to the approximate choice of @xmath81 . with this purpose in mind",
    "we also carried out the calculations with slightly modified critical slopes :    * @xmath85 * @xmath86    the maximum difference between the values of @xmath62 obtained with sets i and iii at all the chosen points was found to be of order @xmath87 , while such difference for sets ii and iii was @xmath88 . on the other hand , even considering less accurate set i , we found that the maximum difference between values of @xmath62 calculated with @xmath89 and @xmath90 was of the order of @xmath91 .",
    "thus we conclude that set i yields sufficiently accurate results with the critical slope at origin shown above .    a sample of the results is shown in tables [ tab : tf ] , [ tab : tfd ] and [ tab : tff ] , and a considerably wider range of values is available elsewhere@xcite . from the numerical analysis outlined above we are confident that all the digits in those tables are exact .",
    "when @xmath46 the function is analytic at @xmath47 and numerical experimentation suggests that the taylor series ( [ eq : tff_crit ] ) converges over the whole domain of interest , even at the left endpoint @xmath92 .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the coordinate by defining @xmath93 so that @xmath92 corresponds to @xmath94 .",
    "therefore we may try to calculate the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath53 by means of the sequences of partial sums @xmath95 and the conditions @xmath96 , @xmath97 . since the singularity at @xmath94 ( @xmath92 ) is proportional to @xmath98 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tff_origin ] ) ) the coefficients @xmath99 decrease as @xmath100 and the error of the @xmath101 partial sum falls proportionally to @xmath102 .",
    "for example , in this way we obtain @xmath103 that is correct for five digits versus the actual value @xmath104 .",
    "it is remarkable that a power series is able to yield any accuracy at all for a nonlinear , singular boundary value problem .      accelerating the convergence by applying ordinary pad approximations produced no improvement because the function @xmath105 has a branch point at the left boundary , precisely where we are summing the series to approximate @xmath54 .",
    "however , the so - called `` hermite - pad '' or `` shafer '' approximation is much more successful .",
    "the quadratic shafer approximant @xmath106(s)$ ] is defined to be the solution of the quadratic equation @xcite @xmath107)^{2}+q(s)\\,u[k / l / m]\\,+\\,r(s)=0\\ ] ] where the polynomials @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are of degrees @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "these polynomials are chosen so that the power series expansion of @xmath106(s)$ ] agrees with that of @xmath114 through the first @xmath115 terms .",
    "the constant terms in @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be set arbitrarily to one without loss of generality since these choices do not alter the roots of the equation , so the total number of degrees of freedom is @xmath116 . as true for ordinary pad approximants ,",
    "the coefficients of the polynomials can be computed by solving a matrix equation and the most accurate approximations are obtained by choosing the polynomials to be of equal degree , so - called `` diagonal '' approximants . because the power series begins with @xmath117 ,",
    "the method was applied to @xmath118)/(x_0^{5}s^{4}$ ] in the coordinate @xmath119 ; the eigenparameter is then estimated from @xmath120    the quadratic equation actually yields _ two _ approximations : @xmath121(s ) = \\frac{- q(s ) \\,\\pm \\sqrt { q(s ) ^ { 2 } - 4 p ( s)\\ , r(s)}% } { 2 \\ , p ( s ) }   \\label{eqqqq}\\ ] ] as illustrated for @xmath122 in fig .",
    "[ figtfmaghermitepadeklm16_bothroots ] ; the root obtained from applying the minus sign in front of the radical is spuriously negative on much of the interval @xmath123 $ ] . substituting @xmath124",
    "$ ] into the differential equation yields the  residual function , @xmath125 .",
    "plotting the residual functions as in fig .",
    "[ figtfmaghermitepadeklm16_bothresid ] shows that the `` physical '' root is the plus sign in ( [ eqqqq ] ) ; the residual function is tiny for the plus root but @xmath126 for the negative root .",
    "one warning is that , like ordinary pad approximants , hermite - pad computations are rather ill - conditioned .",
    "we therefore employed maple so that much of the work was done in exact rational arithmetic , and floating points portions were calculated using 60 decimal digits of precision ; we did not investigate ill - conditioning .",
    "the first surprise is that _ both _",
    "solution branches of the hermite - pad _ converge _ to almost the same values as @xmath127 .",
    "we therefore list the errors of the diagonal shafer approximants for @xmath128 from both solutions in table  [ tab1ehermpad ] .",
    "the table also gives the error of the power series up to order @xmath129 from whence the hermite - pad approximations were obtained .",
    "we noticed that the errors of the two branches are roughly equal and opposite ; we therefore also list the error in the__average _ _ of the two roots of the quadratic .",
    "each of the roots of the quadratic is a much better approximation than the power series .    in other applications of hermite - pad approximations ,",
    "the roots converge to separate modes , such as one root to the ground state eigenvalue and the other to the first excited state . here , however , both roots converge to the unique eigenparameter and their average is extraordinarily accurate .",
    "we are unaware of another profitable use of averaging in hermite - pad approximations .",
    "the second surprise is that when @xmath130 , the diagonal approximant develops a spurious singularity in the middle of the spatial interval for both branches as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figtfmaghermitepadeklm20_bothroots ] . except in a narrow neighborhood of the singularity ,",
    "the residual function for one branch is very tiny as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figtfmaghermitepadeklm20_bothresid ] .",
    "it has long been known that ordinary pad approximants may develop similar spurious singularities even at high order and even in spatial regions where the approximants have started to converge ; the difficulty is not due to roundoff error , but rather to a near - coincidence of zeros in the numerator and denominator of the rational function which is the pad approximant @xcite . similarly , the three coefficients of the hermite - pad quadratic and also the discriminant , which is the argument of the square root in the approximations , all have nearly coincident zeros as illustrated in fig .  [ figtfmaghermitepadeklm20_pqrdiscrim ] .",
    "the branches also switch identities at the singularities so that the physical solution is given by the `` plus '' branch on one side of the singularity and by the `` minus '' branch on the other side .",
    "this difficulty is not as serious as it seems . both branches and their average continue to give superb approximations to the eigenparameter @xmath131 .",
    "the ordinary power series converges exponentially fast in the middle of the spatial interval where the hermite - pad fails .",
    "the third surprise is that when the order of the approximant is thirty or larger , both roots predict _ complex - valued _ @xmath53 . when @xmath132 , for example , the two branches of the quadratic give errors in @xmath53 of @xmath133 .",
    "the imaginary parts cancel when the average is taken , leaving the extraordinarily small and real valued average error of about @xmath134 ! thus , in spite of the three surprises , which are also complications , and need for high precision arithmetic at high order , the hermit - pad acceleration of the right endpoint taylor series is very successful .",
    "we can improve the results by removing the singularity through a convenient transformation of the differential equation ( [ eq : tff_eq ] ) . instead of the variables discussed above it",
    "is more convenient for our aims to choose @xmath135 and @xmath136 so that the differential equation becomes @xmath137 in this way the domain size @xmath53 appears as a sort of eigenparameter @xmath51 .",

    "the rate of convergence is remarkable for a power - series approach to a nonlinear problem .",
