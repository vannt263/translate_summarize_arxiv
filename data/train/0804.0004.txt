    "dark matter haloes are formed from fluctuations in the matter density field as characterized by the matter power spectrum . a theoretical understanding of the relationship between the matter power spectrum and the numbers and clustering of dark matter haloes provides an essential link between cosmological parameters and the properties of haloes in which observable ( or potentially observable ) galaxies live .",
    "haloes form from gravitationally induced non - linear collapse of mass overdensities that grow from primordial density fluctuations .",
    "thus , halo clustering properties in a universe composed of cold dark matter are determined entirely by the matter power spectrum , or equivalently , by the cosmological parameters .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use dark matter simulations to quantify the relation between the matter power spectrum and resulting halo clustering properties , focusing on haloes of masses capable of star or galaxy formation during the era of reionization .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to incorporate baryon physics to model galaxy formation within haloes .",
    "however , the distribution of haloes , which we explore , can be used as a basis for studies that populate haloes with galaxies to model galaxy clustering properties , which can then be used to probe cosmology and galaxy formation at high redshifts .",
    "halo clustering and its evolution has been studied extensively by a number of authors , mainly focusing on cluster , group , or galaxy mass scales at low redshifts ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "however , few studies have explored the halo or galaxy distribution in the reionizing era ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , an epoch just beginning to be targeted by a number of surveys , expected to provide a new probe of cosmology and the physics of galaxy formation . at these high redshifts , haloes large enough to host stars and galaxies",
    "are expected to form from much rarer fluctuations ( i.e.  collapsed from higher sigma overdensities ) than haloes that host typical galaxies or even groups and clusters in the low redshift universe .",
    "this could lead to different halo clustering properties , which we will explore using numerical simulations .",
    "the press & schechter formalism ( @xcite ) provides a general analytic framework for understanding halo formation , and has been improved by a number of subsequent authors ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . utilizing the extended press & schechter formalism",
    ", @xcite developed a theoretical means of predicting halo clustering properties from the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "numerical simulations have been utilized by a number of the fore - mentioned authors to validate and improve upon these works .",
    "recently , we used a suite of high resolution numerical simulations to quantify the numbers of haloes during the reionizing era @xcite ( see also e.g.  luki et al .  2007 and @xcite ) .",
    "this work utilizes the same simulations to analyze the clustering properties of haloes .",
    "we argue that halo clustering is at least somewhat `` universal '' with respect to the linear matter fluctuation field .",
    "if halo clustering is exactly `` universal '' , then haloes of different mass and redshift formed from linear fluctuations of the same rarity will have identical clustering properties ( see   2 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath1 haloes of cluster mass at @xmath2 would have the same relative clustering with respect to the mass distribution as @xmath1 haloes of galaxy mass at @xmath3 .",
    "universality of halo clustering has been explored at lower redshifts by authors mentioned earlier , but has not been thoroughly addressed during the reionization period .",
    "we argue later that approximate universality holds for large - scale halo clustering to redshift 30 , though it breaks down at small scales for the more massive haloes at z@xmath610 .",
    "the universality of large - scale clustering that we will show is a convenient feature ( also held by the halo mass function ; see e.g.  @xcite ; reed et al .",
    "2003 , 2007 ; luki et al .",
    "2007 ) that should enable the results of our simulations , which are evolved only to @xmath3 , to be applicable to rare haloes over a wide redshift range .",
    "rare , massive haloes attainable in current and future generations of high redshift clustering surveys , should have large - scale clustering strength relative to the mass , i.e.  _ bias _ , similar to that of equally rare , massive haloes at lower redshifts ( e.g.  clusters , qso hosts )    the mass range of high redshift haloes that we are able to resolve includes virtually all haloes large enough to form stars or galaxies ; see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein for a review of high redshift star formation .",
    "the first stars are expected to form within `` mini - haloes '' of @xmath7 where primordial gas cools and contracts mainly by @xmath8-cooling ( e.g.  abel , bryan , & norman 2000,2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 1999,2002 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the `` first galaxies '' may form within haloes of virial temperatures greater than @xmath9 ( @xmath10 at @xmath11 ) , where gas is able to cool via collisionally - induced atomic hydrogen cooling , a more effective process .",
    "one should keep in mind that metal enrichment or other feedback effects may have a large influence on what types of haloes can cool and transform gas into stars sufficiently to resemble a `` galaxy '' .    using extremely high redshift galaxies for cosmology has some particular advantages .",
    "their small masses allow the matter power spectrum to be probed on very small scales .",
    "for example , warm dark matter models with filtering lengths @xmath12kpc can be tested if the abundance and bias of @xmath13 hosts of the `` 1st galaxies '' can be measured .",
    "additionally , `` 1st galaxies '' can potentially enable observations of the first stages of galaxy formation .",
    "halo clustering can , in principle , be used to constrain both cosmology and the physics of galaxy formation with extremely high redshift galaxies ( @xmath14 ) as found , for example , by the lyman - break ( dropout ) technique ( e.g.  @xcite ) or by the redshifted lyman alpha emission line ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we note that our redshift 10 haloes include the likely mass range of candidate @xmath11 lyman-@xmath15 emitters found behind a lensing cluster by stark et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . because the survey volume of that study is highly uncertain ,",
    "so is the abundance , and hence the mass , of dark halo hosts of these objects .",
    "as future ever more sensitive observations target similar galaxies , and with the upcoming launch of james webb space telescope ( jwst ) , their clustering properties should be measurable .",
    "this will constrain the properties of the haloes in which they live .",
    "it is thus essential to develop our theoretical understanding of halo and galaxy clustering in this regime .    in this study , we examine halo bias in the reionizing universe . in   2 ,",
    "we review briefly theoretical studies of halo bias . in   3 , we discuss our suite of simulations and analysis techniques .",
    "we present measurements of halo bias and its scale - dependence from our simulations in   4 . in   5 , we analyze the kinematics of haloes and mass , and address the sensitivity of the pairwise velocity dispersion to the volume of the simulation .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of how our results can be used as a basis for using reionizing era galaxies to explore cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "clustering can be quantified by counting the numbers of pairs as a function of separation relative to that of a random distribution , as in the two - point correlation function , @xmath16 haloes can be either _ more _ or _ less _ clustered than the matter fluctuation spectrum , as described by the _ bias _ , which we compute as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the halo two - point correlation function and @xmath19 is the same for the mass .",
    "the two - point correlation function is directly related to the power spectrum by the fourier transform , expressed as : @xmath20    on large , linear scales , halo formation modeled by extended press & schechter formalism ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) can be used to predict halo clustering . in this model ,",
    "halo formation occurs when linear fluctuations within a global gaussian random density field grow gravitationally to reach a critical threshold for collapse , @xmath21 , computed for spherical overdensities .",
    "@xcite utilized this model to predict halo bias and demonstrated that bias should be scale - independent on sufficiently large scales . in this formalism",
    ", the bias is closely related to the mass function , which has been shown by @xcite , sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ; smt ) , and @xcite to be better described by an ellipsoidal halo collapse model .",
    "the ellipsoidal collapse model of smt results in large - scale bias consistent with simulations of e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , and given by : @xmath22 , \\nonumber \\label{smtbias}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the rms linear overdensity in top - hat spheres of mass m. for an infinite volume , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the linear power spectrum of the density fluctuations at @xmath2 , @xmath31 is the fourier transform of the real - space top - hat filter , and @xmath32 is the growth factor of linear perturbations normalised to unity at @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the above bias relation is universal in the sense that bias depends only upon @xmath33 , which describes the `` rarity '' of the density fluctuation from which the halo is formed , independently of halo mass and redshift .",
    "there is an intrinsic scale - dependence of halo bias , which can be strong on small - scales , but vanishes on large - scales .",
    "the scale - dependence of bias is difficult to compute analytically because the mass fluctuation field becomes nonlinear on small scales .",
    "it is thus advantageous to employ numerical simulations .",
    "this study consists of a subset of the simulations presented in @xcite , summarized in table [ simtable ] .",
    "these runs consist of dark matter particles evolved from linear initial conditions using a modified version of the parallel n - body code gadget2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the wide range of simulation volumes allows us to model haloes over a large range in mass , and to determine empirically the effects of finite simulation volume , discussed below .",
    "consequently , our suite of simulations has a large enough effective dynamic range to model haloes covering the bulk of the mass range able to form stars in the reionizing era .",
    "haloes are selected by the friends - of - friends algorithm ( @xcite ) where all particles separated by less than @xmath34 times the mean inter - particle separation are linked into a common halo .",
    "we have tested that our results are not sensitive to the choice of halo finder by verifying that halos defined using a spherical overdensity of 178 times mean , another commonly used halo definition , have clustering properties similar to our friends - of - friends halos ( see   4.1 for further discussion ) .",
    "the effects of the finite simulation volume might be expected to alter the clustering properties of the simulation .",
    "finite simulation volumes lack power with wavelengths larger than the box , and suffer from discreteness of power especially for long wavelength modes ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; luki et al .",
    "the resulting effects on clustering can be strong for the small volumes required to model the low mass haloes relevant for high redshift star formation .",
    "but fortunately , finite - volume effects are similar for dark matter and for haloes , as we show in fig .",
    "[ biasbox ] . as a result , the finite - volume effects on halo bias are much weaker than the effects on absolute clustering properties of mass or haloes . for this reason ,",
    "the halo bias measured within a simulation is reliable over a substantial range of scales smaller than the length of the box .",
    "[ biasbox ] shows an example of the two - point correlation function , @xmath35 , for dark matter and for haloes with virial temperatures greater than @xmath36 at @xmath3 ( approximately @xmath37 , using the relation @xmath38 h^{-1 } \\msun$ ] ) , and spanning a factor of ten in halo mass .",
    "the bottom panel shows halo bias for several box sizes , demonstrating that any systematic affects on bias due to finite - volume are weak provided that the scale sampled is sufficiently smaller than the box size .",
    "we find that as a conservative choice , the bias measured from pair separations below @xmath39 is adequate for our desired level of accuracy ( @xmath40 ) in our simulations . the bold portion of the bias curves in fig . [ biasbox ] and [ biashalos ]",
    "extend only to this scale .",
    "although the scatter in bias is close to @xmath41 at small scales and large masses where numbers of pairs are small , we demonstrate later that we are able to measure bias at large scales to @xmath40 , using @xmath39 as a maximum pair separation .",
    "our smallest box size of @xmath42mpc , which might be expected to be most likely to suffer finite - volume effects , does not have enough haloes of this mass for us to compute reliably a correlation function ; however , we have confirmed using smaller haloes that the bias found in the smallest boxes agrees with that in larger boxes .",
    "the decrease in bias at small scales is mainly due to the fact that it is not possible to have a halo pair separated by less than twice the halo radius , sometimes referred to as the halo exclusion effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "on very small scales , the uncertainty increases due to small numbers of closely separated pairs , as reflected by the increased scatter .",
    "we have just shown that halo bias is not affected strongly by box size , an argument that is strengthened by the agreement among overlapping boxes in fig [ biashalos ] . however , because individual realizations and different simulation volumes each have a unique form of @xmath28 , consideration of the universality of halo bias can be strengthened if one uses the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 specific to each realization as the effective universal mass variable .",

    "we explore further the large - scale bias in the next subsection .",
    "first , we show the scale - dependence and compare with fits from clusters in simulations of much lower redshifts .",
    "the scale - dependence has been parameterized in terms of the halo pair separation , @xmath56 : @xmath57^{\\alpha},\\ ] ] with @xmath58 by @xcite and @xmath59 by @xcite , where @xmath60 is the bias relation of @xcite , which is similar to @xmath61 . the steeper scale - dependence of @xcite is consistent with our small haloes , but is not steep enough to match the most massive haloes in our simulations .",
    "the @xcite bias relation ( not plotted ) is much shallower than that of @xcite , making for a poor match to the scale - dependence in our data .",
    "the bias fit of @xcite , which is parameterized in terms of the non - linear mass correlation function , @xmath35 , rather than the linear variance in spheres , as in the above relation , implies even weaker scale dependence than that of @xcite when extrapolated to our mass and redshift range , and so is not consistent with our results .",
    "it requires a large extrapolation to apply low redshift fits of cluster bias to our higher redshifts , lower masses , and much rarer ( larger @xmath62 ) haloes than previously tested , so it is perhaps not surprising that we find a steeper scale - dependence for many of our haloes .",
    "even so , the reasonable level of agreement for our lower mass haloes suggests `` partial universality '' .",
    "our haloes at redshift 10 are well fit by the following relation : @xmath63 \\label{biasrfitsmt}\\ ] ] ( ignoring halo exclusion effects at small separations ) .",
    "we have checked that our fit remains consistent with our simulation outputs from redshifts 10 to 30 , though the uncertainties and scatter become greater at high redshifts .",
    "this fit , however , is not intended to be valid at redshifts lower than we have considered .",
    "in fact , if extrapolated to the lower redshifts probed by @xcite , our fit has significantly steeper scale - dependence than their simulations , reflecting non - universality .",
    "we have confirmed the lack of universality of this parameterization of the scale - dependent bias using separate simulations of larger volumes evolved to low redshifts .",
    "though the halo samples considered here were divided into cumulative samples for illustrative purposes , the above fit agrees with the bias obtained when samples are restricted to a much narrower mass range of a factor of two . for visual clarity ,",

    "we demonstrate in the appendix that the finite - volume corrected large - scale bias of each realization is a much better description of the bias measured in simulations , particularly for the smallest boxes .",
    "a number of factors may affect the universality of the scale - dependence of halo bias .",
    "the slope of the linear power spectrum on halo pre - collapse scales is much steeper in our simulations because the halo masses are smaller relative to that typical of low redshift simulations .",
    "the steeper power spectrum may affect halo clustering ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and cause the apparent non - universality with respect to low redshift clusters .",
    "another contributing factor may be that the effective definition of a halo changes based on its concentration and environment ( luki et al .",
    "the low concentrations and dominance of large filamentary structure at high redshift ( gao et al .",
    "2005 ) may cause the halo finder to combine or split haloes differently relative to their lagrangian ( linear ) initial density fluctuations .",
    "we have checked the effect of halo definition by verifying that the bias of haloes defined using a spherical overdensity of 178 times mean is consistent , though perhaps slightly higher and steeper , as might be expected from their lower abundance ( @xcite ) . further theoretical",
    "work regarding halo formation is needed to understand fully the scale - dependence of halo clustering .",
    "we leave the search for a more universal parameterization of the scale - dependence of bias to future studies .",

    "[ biaslarge ] .",
    "the smt bias relation is consistent with our data at all redshifts while the mo & white bias relation is inconsistent with our results . by going to very high redshift , we are able to measure the bias of haloes formed from @xmath64 fluctuations , representing a major improvement upon previous bias measurements at high redshift .",
    "in particular , the millennium run bias data ( from @xcite ) extend to @xmath1 haloes at @xmath65 , and @xcite compute bias for a narrower mass range at @xmath3 .",

    "this scatter suggests that the data are accurate to about 10@xmath67 in bias ( ignoring any potential systematics ) .",
    "given the scatter within our data , it is not possible to distinguish between the smt bias relation and that of more precise fits such as @xcite , @xcite , or the bias relation that would be derived using the mass function fit to these simulations ( @xcite ) .    the agreement with the plotted millennium data ( @xcite ) for our @xmath68 haloes confirms universality and suggests that our box - size correction technique is successful .",
    "the evidence for universality of halo bias is strengthened by our agreement with @xcite for @xmath69 haloes , where their results agree with the smt bias .",
    "however , the source of the @xmath70 disagreement between our data and the lower redshift bias at @xmath71 from the millennium run , with which the @xcite bias appears to also agree , is not clear .",
    "although this could indicate departure from universality at the @xmath7220@xmath67 level ( in bias ) , because the differences occur at small masses in the smallest boxes where the finite - volume corrections are largest ( see appendix ) , potential systematics are not easily ruled out .",
    "our work verifies that estimates of halo bias derived from extended press - schechter theory and variants are valid for extremely rare haloes .",
    "additionally , our comparison with other studies at lower redshifts significantly extends the confirmed regime of approximate universality ( at the @xmath0 level ) in mass , redshift , and @xmath62 of large - scale bias .",
    "some care must be taken when computing bias from haloes in finite volumes . because the scale - dependence of the bias extends to scales approaching the maximum pair separations where bias measurements remain robust , a simple averaging of the bias over the reliably sampled range in scales would result in a systematic error ( i.e.  a `` bias bias '' ) .",

    "clustering measurements have been made of ly-@xmath15-emitters and lyman - break galaxies , allowing estimates of the mass of their host haloes ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "^{1/2}$ ] at @xmath3 as a function of cumulative halo number density for 2 cosmologies with different values of @xmath96 and @xmath105 .",
    "the bias relation used is the sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) fit , applicable to large scales ( see fig .",
    "[ biashalos ] ) .",
    "halo number density is a fit to simulations from reed et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , eqn .",
    "halo bias at @xmath3 is generally more sensitive to cosmology than at low redshifts , and remains so over a wide range in halo abundance ( or halo mass ) . ]",
    "once the large - scale bias and cosmology are determined , the scale - dependence of halo bias , to the degree that it is `` universal '' , is also determined .",
    "comparison of the observed scale - dependence of galaxy clustering to that of haloes with the same large - scale bias thus provides a valuable indicator of local environmental effects on galaxy formation . the strong clustering and steep scale - dependence of the clustering for high redshift haloes may cause feedback from neighbouring galaxies to affect star formation during these early times .",
    "many possible complications to this simple picture will need to be considered .",
    "for example , the large scales of reionization bubbles ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) may correlate with galaxy clustering on large scales ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which leads to the possibility of reionization affecting galaxy formation and galaxy clustering on large scales ( e.g.  @xcite ) . or",
    ", multiple galaxies may occupy massive haloes , which creates a degeneracy in galaxy abundance between satellite numbers and halo mass .",
    "similarly , there exists a degeneracy between halo mass and satellite numbers in the scale - dependence of clustering on small scales .",
    "these degeneracies are difficult to overcome observationally because of the need for clustering measurements on very small angular scales ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , one can use theoretical arguments , semi - analytic modelling and/or smaller volume simulations utilizing hydrodynamics and other detailed physics to infer basic galaxy properties such as the numbers , luminosities , and environmental influences ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "progress may then be made by combining the results of such detailed models of galaxy formation with determinations of halo clustering from dark matter simulations in order to produce detailed predictions for observable clustering properties .",
    "this will help to break the degeneracies between galaxy `` feedback '' and halo clustering on small scales , as well as determine whether haloes tend to host multiple luminous galaxies .",
    "as ever deeper observations are made , such studies will allow us to probe galaxy formation at its earliest stages and to explore cosmology at the high redshift frontier .",
    "we close with a brief discussion of the ( perhaps surprisingly ) large suppression to the halo pairwise velocity dispersion by finite simulation volumes .",
    "pairwise velocity dispersions are reduced by up to and beyond @xmath106 in our simulations , even on scales where halo spatial bias is well behaved .",
    "the general suppression of halo and mass velocities may have significant effects on hydrodynamic simulations where small volumes are often required because of computational expense .",
    "for example , volumes of @xmath107mpc are commonly employed in simulations that model the cooling of gas within high redshift haloes to form the `` first stars '' ( e.g.  abel , bryan , & norman 2000,2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 1999,2002 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility that gas heating due to shocks of infalling material of merging haloes could be inhibited due to the suppression of pairwise velocities .",
    "such effects have the potential to alter gas cooling and the ionization level of halo gas , which could affect star formation .",
    "however , because the velocity suppression diminishes for close pairs , it is not clear whether the kinematic suppression is actually a major problem for gas dynamics or star formation within simulations of the high redshift universe .",
    "any such problems could be minimized by the `` zoom '' resimulation technique , consisting of a high resolution subvolume embedded within a larger and lower resolution cosmological volume , as in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "further investigation of finite - volume effects on kinematics and any associated effects on gas properties is warranted .",
