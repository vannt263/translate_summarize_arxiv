    "during recent years much attention has been paid to the formulation and study the physics living on noncommutative spaces .",
    "the motivation , among others @xcite , partly is the natural appearance of noncommutative spaces in some areas of physics , for example in the string theory .",
    "in particular it has been understood that the canonical relation @xmath0=\\ir\\,\\theta_{a\\ , b}\\,\\id,\\ ] ] with @xmath1 is an antisymmetric constant tensor , describes the longitudinal directions of d - branes in the presence of a constant b - field background as seen by the ends of open strings @xcite .",
    "the theoretical and phenomenological implications of possible noncommutative coordinates have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "one direction to extend studies on noncommutative spaces is to consider spaces where the commutators of the coordinates are not constants .",
    "examples of this kind are the noncommutative cylinder and the @xmath2-deformed plane @xcite , the so - called @xmath3-poincar algebra @xcite , and linear noncommutativity of the lie algebra type @xcite . in the latter",
    "the dimensionless spatial position operators satisfy the commutation relations of a lie algebra : @xmath4= f^c{}_{a\\ , b}\\,\\hat{x}_c,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 s are structure constants of a lie algebra .",
    "one example of this kind is the algebra so(3 ) , or su(2 ) .",
    "a special case of this is the so called fuzzy sphere @xcite , where an irreducible representation of the position operators is used which makes the casimir of the algebra , @xmath6 , a multiple of the identity operator ( a constant , hence the name sphere )",
    ". one can consider the square root of this casimir as the radius of the fuzzy sphere .",
    "this is , however , a noncommutative version of a two - dimensional space ( sphere ) . in @xcite ,",
    "a four dimensional differential calculus has been developed corresponding to the algebra su(2 ) , based on which the equations of motion corresponding to spin 0 , 1/2 , and 1 particles living in that four dimensional space have been investigated .    in @xcite",
    "a model was introduced in which the representation was not restricted to an irreducible one , instead the whole group was employed ; see also @xcite .",
    "in particular the regular representation of the group was considered , which contains all representations . as a consequence in such models",
    "one is dealing with the whole space , rather than a sub - space like the case of fuzzy sphere as a 2-dimensional surface . in @xcite",
    "basic ingredients for calculus on a linear fuzzy space , as well as the basic notions for a field theory on such a space , were introduced .",
    "models based on the regular representation of su(2 ) were treated in more detail , giving explicit forms of the tools and notions introduced in their general forms @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the tree and loop diagrams for self - interacting scalar and spinor fields discussed .",
    "it is observed that models based on lie algebra type noncommutativity enjoy three features :    * they are free from any ultraviolet divergences if the group is compact .",
    "* the momentum conservation is modified , in the sense that the vector addition is replaced by some non - abelian operation @xcite . * in the transition amplitudes only the so - called planar graphs contribute .    in @xcite the quantum mechanics on a space with su(2 )",
    "fuzziness was examined .",
    "in particular , the commutation relations of the position and momentum operators corresponding to spaces with lie - algebra noncommutativity in the configuration space , as well as the eigen - value problem for the su(2)-invariant systems were studied .",
    "the consequences of the lie type noncommutativity of space on thermodynamical properties have been explored in @xcite .",
    "the classical motion on noncommutative space has attracted interests as well @xcite . in particular , the central force problems on space - times with canonical and linear noncommutativity and their observational consequences have been the subject of different research works @xcite . in @xcite the classical mechanics defined on a space with su(2 ) fuzziness was studied .",
    "in particular , the poisson structure induced by noncommutativity of su(2 ) type was investigated , for either the cartesian or euler parameterization of su(2 ) group .",
    "the consequences of su(2)-symmetry in such spaces on integrability , were also studied in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to examine in more detail the classical central force problem in a space with linear su(2 ) fuzziness . in particular , using the path equation , the conditions are obtained under which the slightly perturbed circular orbits are stable or closed .",
    "the differential equation is obtained that the potentials should satisfy to guarantee that all of the perturbed circular orbits of them would be closed .",
    "the numerical solutions of the mentioned differential equation as well as the path equation under the obtained potentials are presented .",
    "it is shown that among attractive power - law potentials it is only the kepler one that all of its bound - states make closed orbits .",
    "the analytic solution of the path equation under the kepler potential is given .",
    "the scheme of the rest of this paper is the following . in section 2 ,",
    "a short review of the construction in @xcite is presented . in section 3",
    "the circular orbits and various aspects of their perturbations are considered . in section 4",
    "the kepler problem and its analytic solution is presented .",
    "appendix a is devoted to the derivation of the differential equation by which the potentials with closed perturbed circular orbits are obtained .",
    "the classical dynamics on a space whose poisson structure is originated from a lie algebra is given in @xcite .",
    "to make this presentation self contained , below a short review of the construction is presented",
    ".      denote the members of a basis for the left - invariant vector fields corresponding to the group @xmath7 by @xmath8 s .",
    "these fields satisfy the commutation relation ( [ 2 ] ) , with the structure constants of the lie algebra corresponding to @xmath7 .",
    "the members of this basis would contain the quantum mechanical ( operator form ) counterparts of the classical spatial coordinates of the system ( for the moment they are dimensionless ) .",
    "the group elements of @xmath7 are parametrized by the coordinates @xmath9 s as : @xmath10 these coordinates would play the role of the conjugate momenta of @xmath8 s .",
    "the coordinates and the momenta in their operator forms ( denoted by hat ) would satisfy the following relations @xmath11&=0,\\\\ \\label{5 } [ \\hat{x}_a,\\hat{k}^b]&=\\hat{x}_a{}^b,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 s as scalar functions of @xmath13 s , having the property @xmath14 accordingly , the operator forms of @xmath8 s in the @xmath15-basis are @xmath16 the explicit forms of the @xmath17 scalars for the su(2 ) group will be given later @xcite .",
    "there are also the right - invariant vector fields whose basis @xmath18 satisfy @xmath19&= -f^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,\\hat{x}_c^{\\mathrm{r}},\\\\ \\label{9 } [ \\hat{x}_a^{\\mathrm{r}},\\hat{x}_b]&=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using these , one defines the vector field @xmath20 through @xmath21 using ( 9 ) and the definitions of the left- and right - actions , it is found that @xmath22 s are the generators of similarity transformation ( adjoint action ) : @xmath23 by all these above the following commutation relations hold @xmath24&=f^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,\\hat{j}_c,\\\\ \\label{12 } [ \\hat{j}_a,\\hat{x}_b]&=f^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,\\hat{x}_c,\\\\ \\label{13 } [ \\hat{k}^c,\\hat{j}_a]&=f^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,\\hat{k}^b.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the above commutation relations , in the case of the group su(2 ) ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath22 s simply satisfy the commutation relation of the rotation generators , and thus represent the components of the angular momentum .    to construct the phase space ,",
    "all that is needed is to transform the commutation relations to poisson brackets .",
    "this can be done through the correspondence @xmath26/(\\ir\\hbar)\\to\\{.\\,,.\\}$ ] .",
    "however , one should also take care of the dimension of the quantities , and their reality ( _ i.e. _ hermitian in operator form ) . to do so , let us define the following quantities @xmath27,\\\\ \\label{17 } j_a&:=\\ir\\,\\hbar\\,\\hat{j}_a,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a constant of dimension length .",
    "one then arrives at the following poisson brackets @xmath29 where the dimension of @xmath30 is that of inverse momentum : @xmath31 one notes that @xmath32 s and @xmath33 s are independent variables , and other variables can be expressed in terms of these . so that among the poisson brackets ( [ 18 ] ) to ( [ 23 ] ) , only ( [ 18 ] ) , ( [ 19 ] ) , and ( [ 20 ] ) are independent .",
    "all others can be derived from these .    using ( [ 6 ] ) it is seen that in the limit @xmath34 ( corresponding to @xmath35 ) , the ordinary poisson brackets are retrieved .",
    "for the special case of group su(2 ) , the independent poisson brackets ( [ 18 ] ) , ( [ 19 ] ) , and ( [ 20 ] ) are in fact the poisson structure of a rigid rotator , in which the angular momentum and the rotation vector have been replaced by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , that is , the roles of position and momenta have been interchanged",
    ". it would be convenient to use the euler parameters , defined through @xmath38 where @xmath39 s are the generators of su(2 ) satisfying the commutation relation @xmath40=\\epsilon^c{}_{a\\,b}\\,t_c.\\ ] ] it should be emphasized that in this setting the euler angular parameters , in opposite to their ordinary definition , are parametrizing the momentum space , and their canonical conjugate components @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 play the role of the parametrization of the ( real ) configuration space .",
    "one also mention that in this setup , @xmath44 , @xmath1 , and @xmath45 are dimensionless , while @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 have the dimension of action .",
    "one advantage of using the euler parameters over the ordinary rotational generator @xmath46 is that the poisson brackets of @xmath44 , @xmath1 , @xmath45 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the standard canonical ones @xcite , namely the only nonzero poisson brackets are @xmath47 using this set of parameters one can find the basis for the generators of left action , whose non - operator forms as spatial coordinates are found to be @xcite @xmath48,\\\\ \\label{31 } x_2=\\;&\\lambda\\,\\left[\\frac{\\sin\\psi}{\\sin\\theta}\\,x_\\phi+\\cos\\psi\\,x_\\theta- \\frac{\\sin\\psi\\,\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\\,x_\\psi\\right],\\\\ \\label{32 } x_3=\\;&\\lambda\\,x_\\psi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly the angular momentum components are found as follow @xcite @xmath49 it is mentioned that the above components have the correct dimension ( _ i.e. _ length for @xmath32 s and action for @xmath22 s ) .",
    "one also has @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in the case with motion under a central force ,",
    "the poisson brackets of hamiltonian @xmath53 with @xmath22 s vanish .",
    "a hamiltonian which is a function of only @xmath54 and @xmath55 is clearly so .",
    "for such a system , @xmath53 , @xmath56 and one of the components of @xmath57 ( say @xmath58 ) are involutive constants of motion , hence any su(2)-invariant classical system is integrable . as @xmath57 is a constant vector",
    ", one can choose the axes so that the third axis is parallel to this vector : @xmath59 by which , after subtracting @xmath60 and @xmath61 , one has : @xmath62 assuming @xmath63 , leads to @xmath64 defining the new variables @xmath65 for which @xmath66 .",
    "so only @xmath67 and @xmath68 are left as the canonically conjugate variables . applying ( [ 38 ] ) , one arrives at @xmath69,\\nonumber\\\\ \\cos\\frac{{k}}{2}&=\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen that the motion is not in the plane @xmath70 , but in a plane parallel to that , as @xmath71 does not vanish but is a constant .    by defining the polar coordinates ( @xmath72 ) in the @xmath73 plane : @xmath74 and @xmath75 , one has @xmath76 where @xmath77 one then has @xmath78.\\ ] ] in the line similar to the motion on ordinary space , one can proceed to derive the equation for the path , in terms of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the first - order path equation is found to be @xcite : @xmath81.\\ ] ] we mention that , by ( [ 40 ] ) and ( [ 43 ] ) , @xmath82 can be expressed as the kinetic energy . in the case of our interest , the @xmath15-space as angle variable in ( [ 25 ] ) is a compact one , and so the momenta is taken to be bounded , that is @xmath83 .",
    "following @xcite , the kinetic term is taken to be @xmath84 for a particle of mass @xmath85 . by this choice",
    ", the kinetic term is a su(2)-invariant ( rotationally - invariant ) , and hence a class - function of su(2 ) , which is also monotonically increasing in the above mentioned interval @xmath83 , just as in the case we have in ordinary classical mechanics , with @xmath86 .",
    "also we mention in the limit @xmath34 , the expression ( [ 46 ] ) coincides with the ordinary kinetic term , as it should .",

    "the above condition for the power law potentials of the form @xmath111 leads to @xmath112 or in a more compact form @xmath113 showing that for the minus sign , for which the force is repulsive , the circular orbit is not allowed .",

    "the condition on ordinary space is @xmath118      it is a matter of interest to look for the condition by which the circular orbits stay bounded after a slight perturbation . to obtain the condition",

    "the interesting difference between this model and the one on ordinary space comes from the last term in above , by which , due to its negative sign , the cases with @xmath127 on ordinary space here may give a negative one .",
    "for the attractive power law of the form @xmath129 for which the circular orbit is allowed , we find @xmath130 which is always positive .",

    "so , having ( [ 76 ] ) and ( [ 78 ] ) , one should expect that the only power law force for which not only the perturbed circular orbits but also _ all _ of the bound - states orbits are closed could be the kepler one .",

    "potentials the condition on @xmath139 for having closed orbits is free from the initial conditions , and only depends on @xmath139 @xcite . here , except for the case with @xmath136 in ( [ 78 ] ) , due to existence of @xmath140 factor in ( [ 76 ] ) and ( [ 78 ] ) , both the value of @xmath139 and the initial conditions , by which @xmath102 is fixed , are important .",
    "one can ask about the condition by which _ all _ the perturbed circular orbits are closed . interpreting ( [ 74 ] ) as a differential equation that potential @xmath90 should satisfy for a fixed rational @xmath141 , one would find the form of the potentials for which , no matter what the initial conditions are , all of the perturbed circular orbits are closed @xcite . to do",
    "so one should write the condition ( [ 74 ] ) in the way that the constant of motion @xmath142 would not appear in it .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath119 , which is related to 3-dimensional radial variable @xmath143 by ( [ 53 ] ) , should be replaced by @xmath143",
    ". this can be done , and the result comes to the form ( see appendix a ) @xmath144 in which @xmath145    it is easy to see that the kepler potential @xmath146 satisfies ( [ 80 ] ) with @xmath147 .",
    "in fact , by direct insertion , as expected by ( [ 78 ] ) , it can be checked that , except the kepler potential , the other kinds of attractive power law potentials ( [ 75 ] ) and ( [ 77 ] ) do not satisfy the above equation .",
    "this observation is in deep contrast with the case on ordinary space in which it can be shown that all the perturbed circular orbits of the power law potentials in the form @xmath148 are closed @xcite .    for a given @xmath141 ,",
    "one still may look for the non - power law solutions of ( [ 80 ] ) .",
