    "weyl semimetals ( wsm ) are a new class of conducting materials , characterized by the nontrivial topological structure of their band structures .",
    "these three - dimensional topological semimetals have been the subject of intense recent theoretical and experimental efforts @xcite .",
    "wsm host an even number of points in the brillouin zone , known as the weyl nodes , at which the bulk energy gap closes .",
    "the electrons around these nodes disperse relativistically , and may be described at low energies by the weyl hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "each weyl node acts as either a source or a sink of berry flux .",
    "hence , a single node is stable and can not be removed .",
    "additionally , any closed two - dimensional manifold in the three - dimensional brillouin zone ( bz ) which separates regions with different berry charge must have a non - zero chern number as it is threaded by a non - zero berry flux .",
    "thus , as long as weyl nodes of opposite berry charge , are separated in momentum space , these systems host 2d surface states which form fermi - arcs in the two - dimensional bz of the surface @xcite .    certain iridium pyrochlores and noncentrosymmetric transition metals , e.g. taas ,",
    "have been predicted to host such a topological semimetal phase @xcite . following these suggestions , several topological semimetals",
    "have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that , when subject to a magnetic field , such materials exhibit unusual physical phenomena , such as the adler - bell - jackiw chiral anomaly @xcite , unique type of quantum oscillations associated with fermi - arc surface states @xcite and various non - local transport effects @xcite . in particular , ref .   proposed two experiments that directly probe the exotic topology of these materials : appearance of a magnetic - field - dependent non - local dc voltage and sharp resonances in the transmission of electromagnetic waves .",
    "both these effects do not rely on quantum mechanical phase coherence , which renders them less restrictive in terms of temperature and samples mobility .",
    "nevertheless , they do require challenging experimental setups such as placing contacts in a close proximity in the dc proposal and working with a thz frequency radiation in the ac proposal .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative dc experiment that does not require any deposition of contacts over the weyl semimetal : a magnetic - field - dependent non - local coulomb drag measurement .",
    "the underlying mechanism in this work is similar to one presented in ref .  .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to surfaces that carry fermi arcs , electrons traverse cyclotron orbits that connect opposite surfaces of the sample .",
    "these unusual inter - surface orbits are a source of non - local conductivity in these materials , i.e. , the application of an electric field along a surface of these materials generates a current along the opposite surface and vice versa . in the following ,",
    "we provide a prescription which is aimed to detect the emergence of non - locality via a coulomb drag experiment .",
    "standard coulomb drag setups involve two closely spaced , yet electrically isolated conductors . due to the long - range coulomb interaction between charge carriers in the two conductors ,",
    "a current in one of the conductors ( the active layer ) induces a voltage ( or a current ) in the other conductor ( the passive layer ) .",
    "the ratio between the induced voltage in the passive layer and incoming current in the active layer is the drag resistivity @xcite .",
    "drag measurements may be used to study fundamental properties related to the e - e interaction of diverse condensed matter systems . until recently , semiconductor heterostructures ,",
    "e.g. gaalas , with two quantum wells separated by a thin tunnel barrier were the main experimental systems allowing reliable measurements of coulomb drag @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the drag effect on the layer densities , temperature , and separation distance between the quantum wells has been heavily investigated . in these experiments ,",
    "the typical separation between the layers was in the range @xmath0 . in recent years",
    ", the appearance of graphene - boron - nitride heterostructures , made it possible to investigate drag effects in double - layer graphene down to a separation of @xmath1 @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider a scenario where two layers of graphene are separated by a 3d slab of wsm .",
    "the graphene layers are coupled to the wsm only via the coulomb interaction , i.e. , the top and bottom graphene layers generate drag force on the top and bottom surfaces of the wsm respectively . in the absence of an external magnetic field",
    "the system may be thought of as two decoupled standard coulomb drag systems , each one contains a layer of graphene which is coulomb coupled to a surface of a wsm .",
    "since the wsm is metallic , the coupling between these two systems is non - zero , nonetheless , for macroscopic slabs this coupling is extremely small as we show below . on the contrary , in the presence of an external magnetic field",
    ", the non - locality in the wsm yields a strong coupling between the two drag systems and a current in the top graphene layer leads to a non - negligible voltage buildup on the distant lower graphene layer .",
    "the source of the non - local drag is rather simple .",
    "as long as current flows in the top graphene layer , a portion of its momentum is transferred to the top surface of the wsm , due to the existence of a frictional coulomb force . for a standard 2deg in an open circuit configuration",
    ", this momentum transfer is translated into a voltage buildup .",
    "however , as shown in ref .  , for relatively clean samples and in the presence of an external magnetic field the current on the top surface follows the inter - surface cyclotron orbits leading to a circulating current throughout the 3d sample .",
    "in particular , a current on the bottom surface is inevitable for clean samples .",
    "when the non - local conductivity is much larger than the local one , the current on the bottom surface flows with a similar magnitude and an opposite direction to the current on the top surface .",
    "as before , due to the existence of a frictional coulomb force between the bottom surface of the wsm and the bottom graphene layer , a momentum transfer to the second graphene layer occurs .",
    "this momentum transfer is translated into a voltage buildup on the passive graphene layer .",
    "the ratio between this voltage and the current on the top layer is the non - local drag coefficient .",
    "in this section , we describe the experimental setup and the procedure of finding the non - local drag coefficient .",
