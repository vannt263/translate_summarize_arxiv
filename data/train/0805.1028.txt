    "thus , while it is possible to ascribe some of the frustration effects we have studied in the triangular lattice to a purely geometrical origin , for more complex models it is in general necessary to extend the concept of `` geometrical frustration '' beyond that applicable to pure spin systems .",

    "this shows a profound degree of frustration whose origin lies both in the geometry and in the properties of the spin  orbital coupling ; a qualitative evaluation of these respective contributions is discussed below .",
    "all of the phases of the model show a strong preference for the formation of dimers .",
    "this can be demonstrated in a simple , static valence  bond ( vb ) ansatz , and is reinforced by the results of numerical calculations .",
    "the static ansatz is already an exact description of the direct  exchange limit , @xmath83 , and gives the best analytic framework for understanding the properties of much of the remainder of the phase diagram .",
    "the most striking single numerical result is the prevalence of vb states even on a triangular cluster , and the underlying feature reinforced by all of the calculations is the very large additional `` kinetic '' contribution to the ground",
    " state energy arising from the resonance of vbs due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "it is this resonance which drives symmetry restoration in some or all of the spin , orbital , and translational sectors over large regions of the parameter space .",
    "the sole exception to dimerization is found at high @xmath38 and around @xmath83 , where the only mechanism for virtual hopping is the adoption of orbital configurations which permit one orbital to be active ( `` avoided blocking '' ) .",
    "the `` most exotic '' region of the phase diagram is that at small @xmath33 and @xmath38 , and this we have assigned tentatively as an orbital liquid . in this regime ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are at their strongest and most symmetrical , and every indication obtained from energetic considerations of extended systems , and from microscopic calculations of a range of local quantities on small clusters , suggests a highly resonant , symmetry  restored phase . while this orbital liquid is in all probability ( again from the same indicators ) based on resonating dimers , an issue we discuss in full below , we can not exclude fully the possibility of a type of one  dimensional physics : short , fluctuating segments of frustration ",

    "one indicator which can be employed to quantify `` how exotic '' a phase may be is the entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "we define entanglement as the deviation of the spin and orbital sectors from the factorized limit in which their fluctuations can be treated separately .",
    "we compute a spin ",
    "orbital correlation function and use it to measure entanglement , finding that this is significant over the whole phase diagram . qualitatively , entanglement is maximal around the superexchange limit , which is dominated by dimers where singlet formation forces the other sector to adopt a local triplet state . however , for particular clusters and dimer configurations , the high symmetry may allow less entangled possibilities to intervene exactly at @xmath82 .",
    "the direct  exchange limit , @xmath83 , provides additional insight into the entanglement definition : the four  operator spin  orbital correlation function vanishes , reflecting the clear decoupling of the two sets of degrees of freedom at this point , but the finite product of separate spin and orbital correlation functions violates the factorizability condition .",
    "this preponderance of evidence for quantum states based on robust , strongly resonating dimers implies further that the ( spin and orbital ) liquid phase is gapped .",
    "such a state would have only short",
    " ranged correlation functions .",
    "however , these gapped states are part of a low  energy manifold , and for the extended system we have shown that this consists quite generally of large numbers of ( nearly ) degenerate states .",
    "the availability of arbitrary dimer rearrangements at no energy cost has been suggested to be sufficient for the deconfinement of elementary @xmath405 ( and by analogy @xmath522 ) excitations with fractional statistics.@xcite however , the spinons ( orbitons ) are massive in such a model , in contrast to the properties of algebraic liquid phases.@xcite    a low  spin to high  spin transition , occurring as a function of @xmath38 , is present for all values of @xmath33 . the quantitative estimation of @xmath404 in the extended system remains a problem for a more sophisticated analysis . at the qualitative level ,",
    "large @xmath38 can be considered to suppress quantum spin fluctuations by promoting parallel ",
    "spin ( ferromagnetic ) intermediate states on the magnetic ions .",
    "however , even when this sector is quenched , the orbital degrees of freedom remain frustrated , and contain non  trivial problems in orbital dynamics . in the superexchange ( low@xmath33 , high@xmath38 ) region , frustration is resolved by the formation of orbital singlet ( spin triplet ) dimers , whose resonance minimizes the ground  state energy .",
    "the frustration in the direct  exchange ( high@xmath33 , high@xmath38 ) region is resolved by avoided  blocking orbital configurations , and order  by  disorder effects are responsible for the selection of the true ground state from a degenerate manifold of possibilities ; this is the only part of the phase diagram not displaying dimer physics .",
    "thus the ferromagnetic orbital models in both limits exhibit a behavior quite different from that of systems with only @xmath405 spin degrees of freedom on the triangular lattice .",
    "we have commented on both geometry and spin  orbital interactions as the origin of frustration in the models under consideration .",
    "however , a statement such as `` on the triangular lattice , geometrical frustration enhances interaction frustration for spin  orbital models '' must be qualified carefully .",
    "we have obtained anecdotal evidence concerning such an assertion in sec .",
    "vi by considering other lattice geometries , and find that indeed the same model on an unfrustrated geometry appears capable of supporting ordered states ; however , the interplay of the two effects is far from direct , as the kagome lattice presents a case where dimer formation acts to reduce the net frustation . quite generally , spin ",

    "we have found ( i ) a very strong tendency to dimer formation , ( ii ) a large semi  classical degeneracy of basis states formed from these dimers , and ( iii ) that resonance processes even at the four  site plaquette scale provide a very significant energetic contribution . from the final observation alone , a minimal qdm , meaning only exchange of parallel dimers of all three directions and on all possible plaquette units , would already be expected to contain the most significant corrections to the vb energy . at this point we emphasize that , because of the change of su(2 ) orbital sector with lattice direction , our 2d models are not close to the su(4 ) point where four  site plaquette formation , and hence very probably a crystallization , would be expected.@xcite from the results of secs .",

    "<S> we consider the spin  orbital model for a magnetic system with singly occupied but triply degenerate @xmath0 orbitals coupled into a planar , triangular lattice , as would be exemplified by natio@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the ground states of the model for interactions which interpolate between the limits of pure superexchange and purely direct exchange interactions . by considering ordered and dimerized states at the mean  field level , and by interpreting the results from exact diagonalization calculations on selected finite systems , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that orbital interactions are always frustrated , and that orbital correlations are dictated by the spin state , manifesting an intrinsic entanglement of these degrees of freedom . in the absence of hund coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state changes from a highly resonating , dimer  based , symmetry  restored spin and orbital liquid phase , to one based on completely static , spin  singlet valence bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the generic properties of frustration and entanglement survive even when spins and orbitals are nominally decoupled in the ferromagnetic phases stabilized by a strong hund coupling . by considering the same model on other lattices , we discuss the extent to which frustration is attributable separately to geometry and to interaction effects . </S>"
