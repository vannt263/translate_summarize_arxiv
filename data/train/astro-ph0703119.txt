    "interferometers have been introduced in astronomy to gain in spatial resolution without the need to build extremely large telescopes . to resolve _ sirius _",
    ", observations in the infrared domain ( @xmath1 m ) would require a telescope of about 170 m mirror diameter .",
    "fortunately , _",
    "sirius _ can also be resolved by two telescopes of more modest size , separated by 170 m and operated as an interferometer . yet , despite this considerable gain in resolution , interferometers are not the prime tool of today s astronomers .",
    "this is largely due to their limited sensitivity : atmospheric turbulence makes the interferometric fringe pattern move in the detector plane .",
    "accordingly , one tends to use exposure times that are short enough to  freeze \" the turbulence , i.e. typically several milliseconds . to increase the sensitivity ,",
    "phasing devices are being designed that measure the position of the fringe pattern due to a reference star , and correct continuously for the fringe motion of the target object . for such devices to work , a sufficient number of photons need to be collected on the reference star during the time when the atmosphere is frozen , i.e. during the _ atmospheric coherence time _",
    "@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the _ fried parameter _ and @xmath4 is a weighted average of the turbulent layers velocities . clearly , the coherence time is the parameter that determines the performance of today s interferometers .",
    "different definitions of the atmospheric coherence time have been introduced in relation to various observational techniques : single telescopes with or without adaptive - optics , interferometers with or without fringe trackers etc .",
    "however the standard adaptive - optics coherence time @xmath0 has been shown to quantify the performance of all these techniques[[kellerer2 ] ] .",
    "+ in a previous article [ [ kellerer1 ] ] , we characterized the temporal evolution of fringe motion at domec , a summit on the antarctic continent , and a potential site for a future interferometer , using the motion of the fringe pattern formed in the focal plane of a fizeau interferometer .",
    "the temporal and spatial sampling of the measurements were low due to the available equipment and , instead of determining coherence - time values , the mean duration of correlation was assessed by fitting the fringe correlation - function onto an exponential curve ( cf .",
    "section[domec ] ) .",
    "such measurements have now been repeated at the site of paranal , chile , with sufficient spatial and temporal sampling , to allow the determination of the coherence time .",
    "further , all relevant atmospheric parameters are constantly monitored at paranal by a meteorological station , hence the parameter values derived through our set - up ( termed _ piston scope _ ) can be checked against reference values .",
    "+ in the first section , the quantities measured with the piston scope are related to the following atmospheric parameters : the fried parameter , the turbulent layers velocities and the coherence time  using the kolmogorov theory of atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the relations are then tested on the observations performed at paranal .",
    "it is shown that when the sampling is sufficient , the precision on the coherence time is limited by the piston scope s sensitivity to wind direction . given these results , the third section presents a new analysis of the measurements obtained at domec [ [ kellerer1 ] ] .",
    "the lower limits to the coherence time , derived through our first qualitative analysis , are confirmed and additional results on the fried parameter and wavefront speed are given .",
    "the purpose of the piston scope experiment is to track the rapid fluctuations of the atmospheric piston . to this effect",
    ", the entrance pupil of a telescope is covered by a mask with two circular openings .",
    "the resulting image is a fringe pattern within the superposition of the two diffraction discs .",
    "atmospheric turbulence keeps the image of the star moving on the detector .",
    "the local inclination of the wave front over each of the holes causes the movement of the airy discs , whereas difference in the optical path for the two holes , i.e. the piston , shifts the fringe pattern relative to the center of the airy discs .",
    "telescope vibrations , on the other hand , cause merely a common movement of airy discs and fringes .",
    "the relative movements between airy discs and fringes are , therefore , solely due to the atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the subsequent analysis deals with their temporal patterns .",
    "piston changes shift the fringe pattern relative to the airy discs along the interferometric axis . accordingly , in order to assess the temporal fluctuations of the piston it is sufficient to consider the shift along the axis . + as suggested by conan et al .",
    "[ [ conan ] ] , the spatial power spectrum @xmath5 of the relative movements between airy discs and fringes is derived from the phase spectrum @xmath6 , assuming a kolmogorov model of turbulence with an infinite outer scale . in the following we use the notations of conan et al .",

    "several observations of _ spica _ were obtained at paranal on the nights from 22 - 23 and 23 - 24 april 2006 , using a modified slodar [ [ slodar ] ] ( slope detection and ranging ) .",
    "this slodar is designed to measure profiles of the atmospheric turbulence with a telescope that has a 0.4 m diameter primary mirror , and a focal length of 4.064 m .",

    "six sequences of 1000 images were recorded at 300hz with 1ms exposure time .",
    "+ the piston is quantified in terms of the motion of the fringe packet relative to the combined airy discs .",
    "the quantification of the axial motion requires the extraction of the following parameters from the observed images : the position of the central fringe and the position  along the interferometric axis  of the center of the combined airy discs .",
    "this extraction has been described in detail in a previous article [ [ kellerer1 ] ] .",
    "an example of a raw image is shown on fig.[fig : fit ] with the corresponding , fitted intensity profile .",
    "the fried parameter @xmath3 , the wavefront velocity @xmath38 and orientation @xmath30 are derived by fitting @xmath36 onto the data points , as described in section[formalism ] .",
    "@xmath47 corresponds to an atmospheric model where the turbulence is contained in a single layer , that is displaced as a whole with the velocity @xmath38 under an angle @xmath30 .",
    "+ the resulting parameter values and uncertainties are indicated on fig.[fig : p ] . the latter correspond to a doubling of the squared deviation of the data points to the theoretic structure function . the fried parameter is determined by the asymptotic value of the structure function at large time increments . to ease the comparison with the meteorological station of paranal , we indicate the _ seeing angle _ @xmath48 rather than the fried parameter @xmath3 , these two parameters are essentially equivalent : @xmath49[rad ] .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath30 are derived from the first few measurement points and the coherence time , @xmath0 , is then obtained through the classic relation : @xmath50 .      on figs.[fig :",
    "asm_s]-[fig : asm_t ] , the values of @xmath51 and @xmath0 obtained with the piston scope are compared to measurements in terms of the paranal monitoring - instruments .",
    "we do not compare the wind orientations , because the value of @xmath30 that is obtained with the piston scope depends on the position of the mask , hence on the pointing of the telescope , and it is difficult to relate it to the angle measured by the meteorological station .",
    "+    * seeing values ( see fig.[fig : asm_s ] ) : the values estimated with the piston scope coincide with those measured at 6 m height by the dimm [ [ dimm ] ] ( differential image motion monitor ) .",
    "note that we assume the atmosphere to consist of one layer displaced along a single direction , yet fig.[fig : profiles ] shows that on 22 - 23 april the turbulence was contained in several layers with similar intensity .",
    "however , the asymptotic value of the structure function has the same altitude dependence as the seeing : @xmath52 therefore the seeing estimated by the piston scope is correct independently of turbulence profile .",
    "* velocities ( see fig.[fig : asm_w ] ) : the wavefront velocity @xmath53 derived with the piston scope is a turbulence - weighted average of the layers velocities @xmath54 .",
    "ideally , @xmath53 should have the same dependence on turbulence parameters as @xmath0 , hence : @xmath55^{3/5}\\ ] ] sarazin & tokovinin [ [ st ] ] give an empirical relation between @xmath4 and the wind speeds measured at ground level and at 200 mb pressure .",
    "that relation has been verified at paranal and cerro pachon in chile , and later confirmed at san pedro de martir , mexico : @xmath56 at paranal , @xmath57 is measured by wind sensors at 30 m height and @xmath58 is estimated every 6 hours by the ecmwf [ [ ecmwf ] ] ( european center for medium range weather forecast ) through a global meteorological model which runs twice a day at 00ut and 12ut .",
    "this involves the assimilation of worldwide - collected data from radio soundings , satellite observations etc .",
    "+ it appears from fig.[fig : asm_w ] that the wavefront velocities derived with the piston scope coincide with @xmath59 , rather than @xmath60 .",
    "when the turbulence is contained in several layers , the measured structure function is an average of single - layer structure functions as represented on fig.[fig : sf ] .",
    "if these layers have different wind velocities and orientations , the dispersion of the data points around the best - fitting structure function is large and the resulting wavefront velocity is poorly constrained .",
    "accordingly , and in line with fig.[fig : profiles ] , @xmath53 is derived with respectively 55% and 10% uncertainties during the first and second night of observations . *",
    "the coherence time ( see fig.[fig : asm_t ] ) is a combination of the seeing and wavefront velocity , thus it is essentially unconstrained during the first night .",
    "on the subsequent night , the values are consistent with those derived through the two following methods : with mass , @xmath0 is assessed from the scintillation through a 2 cm diameter aperture .",
    "mass is not sensitive to the lower layers of turbulence ( @xmath61 m ) , and , correspondingly , measures higher coherence times . a second value of @xmath0 is obtained by combining dimm seeing - values with measurements of the wind speed : @xmath62 , where @xmath4 is estimated by eq.[eq : vapprox ] . since these values are obtained from distinct locations with different telescopes pointing at different stars , we do not expect them to coincide .",
    "the results seem to suggest that the piston scope sees more turbulence than mass and dimm : while this is probable  the piston scope is installed inside a dome at ground level , whereas mass and dimm are placed on an open platform at 6 m above the ground  no definite conclusion is possible given the amount of data .",
    "domec is one of the summits on the antarctic plateau with altitude 3233 m .",
    "the station , which is jointly operated by france and italy , is located 1100 km inland from the french research station dumont durville and 1200 km inland from the italian zuchelli station .",
    "domec is known as a site with extremely low wind speeds at high altitudes .",
    "because of its elevated location and its relative distance from the edges of the antarctic plateau , domec does not experience the katabatic winds characteristic of the coastal regions of antarctica .",
    "hence the coherence times could be particularly high .",
    "lawrence et al .",
    "[ [ lawrence ] ] have , during the antarctic night , determined high - altitude turbulence parameters that are 2 to 3 times better than at mid - latitude sites .",
    "accordingly , they concluded that an interferometer located on domec might allow projects that would otherwise require instruments in space .",
    "the value of @xmath63ms obtained by lawrence et al .",
    "was derived from measurements with the mass instrument and hence , it does not take into account the turbulence below 500 m ( see the mass website for corresponding calibration studies [ [ mass ] ] ) .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 integrated over the whole atmosphere still need to be obtained .",
    "+ in this context , similar measurements to those presented in section[paranal ] , have been performed at domec , antarctica , on january @xmath64 and february @xmath652005 at daytime . for these measurements ,",
    "_ canopus _ was observed with a telescope of focal length 2.80 m and a primary mirror of 0.28 m , placed 3.5 m above the ground .",
    "the entrance pupil was covered by a mask with two 0.06 m diameter circular openings and centers 0.20 m apart .",
    "the observational set - up , as well as a first qualitative data analysis has been presented in a previous article [ [ kellerer1 ] ] . the observations  done with the available equipment  were both spatially and temporally under sampled . during six sequences out of nine",
    ", it was nevertheless possible to place a lower limit equal to 10ms to the mean duration of correlation @xmath66 of the fringe patterns .",
    "this was done by fitting an exponential curve onto the measured structure functions : @xmath67 in section[formalism ] , the structure function has been related to the fried parameter @xmath3 and to the velocity vector @xmath68 in the case of a single turbulent layer , using the kolmogorov model of atmospheric turbulence .",
    "this relation has been tested on well sampled piston scope measurements recorded at paranal ( see section[paranal ] ) , and is now applied to re - analyze the data from domec .",
    "+ we consider six out of nine sequences that were presented in the previous article .",
    "images were taken every 28ms , with exposure times of 1 , 2 or 3ms .",
    "each sequence contains between 209 and 723images and , thus , lasts roughly 5 to 20s .",
    "two sequences  recorded on february @xmath65 at 7:49ut and 9:41ut  are not re - analyzed because the central positions of the fringe pattern and of the combined airy discs are determined with too large uncertainties . in the previous article they were part of the three sequences during which the correlation time @xmath66 was found to be less than 10ms . for the third such sequence , recorded on january @xmath64 at 9:07ut",
    ", the fringe pattern can be fitted but since the structure function reaches its asymptotic value at the first measurement point , it can not be compared to a theoretical curve . + as seen on fig.[fig : d ] , the structure functions reach their asymptotic value after the @xmath69 to @xmath70 data point .",
    "the fit involves three free parameters @xmath71 besides the white noise , @xmath37 , that is approximately constant if the instrumental settings do not vary .",
    "the data obtained at paranal from april @xmath72 to @xmath73 yield : @xmath74rad@xmath41 . to constrain the fit , @xmath37 is therefore fixed to the value that optimizes the global result of the six fitting procedures : @xmath75rad@xmath41 .",
    "+ the derived parameter - values and uncertainties are indicated on fig.[fig : d ] . as specified in section[paranal ] , the uncertainties correspond to a two - fold increase in the squared deviation of the data points to the theoretic structure function .",
    "the values of the seeing are consistent with measurements by dimm ( fig.[fig : dimm_s ] ) : the difference in the estimates by the piston scope and the dimm at 8.5 m height , resembles the scatter between the values estimated by the dimm instruments at 3.5 m and 8.5 m , and is due to ground layer turbulence . in line with our previous qualitative analysis , coherence times are found to lie above 10ms during the periods when five of the nine sequences were recorded . + note that the wind orientations are not constrained by the analysis . to derive  without continuous assessment of wind - direction profiles",
    " more accurate values of @xmath0 , a parameter needs to be measured that is independent of the wind orientation .",
    "we have pointed out what appears to be a suitable new method in a previous article [ [ kellerer2 ] ] .",
    "the atmospheric coherence time , @xmath0 , is the crucial parameter for interferometers because it determines their sensitivity . yet , a simple method is still lacking to monitor the coherence time at different sites , and to decide where the future large interferometers ought to be built .",
    "does the piston scope fulfill this need ?",
    "to answer that question , we have related the measured quantity to parameters of the kolmogorov model of turbulence .",
    "+ it was found that due to its sensitivity to the wind direction the piston scope can be used to assess the wavefront vrelocity and the coherence time if , and only if , the whole turbulence is displaced along a single direction . since the single layer model is not a permanent feature on most sites , the estimation of the coherence time is insecure .",
    "this conclusion is supported by seven sequences of 1000 images , recorded with the piston scope at the observatory of paranal in april 2005 . to determine the coherence time for any kind of atmospheric turbulence , a rotationally symmetric set - up has been proposed [ [ kellerer2 ] ] and first measurements",
    "are planned .",
