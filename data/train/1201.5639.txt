    "fese has been studied for its magnetic properties  @xcite and showed a phase transition from @xmath0-fese to @xmath2-fese ( tetragonal to hexagonal ) as the growth temperatures were increased  @xcite .",
    "interest in @xmath0-fese have grown after hu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed superconductivity with a @xmath3 because it is structurally related to the newly existing investigations of feas superconductors  @xcite and subsequently the @xmath1 was increased by the application of pressure  @xcite and doping  @xcite .",
    "external pressure up to @xmath4 enhances both spin fluctuations and @xmath1 in @xmath0-fese  @xcite ; however a large external pressure further decreases @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "experimental results show that tetragonal fese undergoes a structural transition to a hexagonal phase  @xcite and at @xmath5 to an orthorhombic phase  @xcite .",
    "more recently , medvedev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported the increase of @xmath1 from @xmath6 to @xmath7 under an applied pressure of @xmath8 and also showed a phase transition from tetragonal to nias - type hexagonal at @xmath9 . compared with the feas superconductors  @xcite , which also show a structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic  @xcite",
    ", @xmath0-fese has not only the same planar sublattices , but also displays structural and magnetic instabilities  @xcite .    albeit fese shows structural transitions , it is not clear how the electronic structure responds to external pressure , and what the transition path of fese should be .",
    "it is then invaluable to study fese in different crystallographic environments to observe the effects of structural changes upon changing the atomic volume or applying pressure .",
    "thus , because of its comparative chemical simplicity with feas superconductors , fese provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay of the structure , magnetism , and superconductivity .",
    "therefore , the determination of the structural and magnetic phase transitions in fese is essential for understanding their electronic properties .",
    "to our knowledge , no systematic study has been performed which can explore the mechanism of the structural phase transitions in stoichiometric fese .",
    "we show that there are structural and magnetic phase transitions at high pressure .",
    "such phase transitions also affect the magnetic , electronic , and bonding properties of fese ; these are considered as an indirect clue for improving the @xmath1 of fese .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the computational models and methods in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] which are used to investigate the structural phase transitions of fese . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we discuss our calculated results , _",
    "i.e. _ , structural phase transition , magnetism , and electronic structures of fese .",
    "the results and discussions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to search for the structural phase transition of fese , we considered different types of crystal structures , _",
    "i.e. _ , anti - pbo  commonly known as @xmath0-fese , as well as nias- , mnp- , cscl- , and cuau - type fese ( see fig .  [ structures ] ) .",
    "these structures are related with each other , _ e.g. _ , mnp - type fese can be considered as a deformed nias - type fese , changing the local hexagonal symmetry around the fe atoms in the nias - type phase to tetrahedral results in the @xmath0-fese phase .",
    "the detailed structure relationship will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "_ ab initio _ calculations were performed using the total - energy all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) method  @xcite in the qmd - flapw package  @xcite based on both the local spin density approximation ( lsda )  @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite .",
    "integrations inside the brillouin zone ( bz ) were performed by the improved tetrahedron method  @xcite over a @xmath10 mesh within the three dimensional ( 3d ) bz and with an energy cutoff at @xmath11@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the lattice parameter of each calculation .",
    "a @xmath14@xmath12 star - function cutoff was used for depicting the charge and potential in the interstitial regions .",
    "lattice harmonics with @xmath15 were employed to expand the charge density , potential , and wave - functions inside each muffin - tin ( mt ) sphere of radii @xmath4 for fe and @xmath16 for se .",
    "the convergence of the computation parameters were checked carefully  @xcite .",
    "all core electrons were treated fully relativistically and valence states were calculated scalar relativistically , _",
    "i.e. _ , without spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "the explicit orthogonalization ( xo ) procedure was employed to ensure the orthogonality between the semicore and valence states with the spill - out of each mt sphere semicore charges being superposed  @xcite .",
    "self - consistency was assumed when the difference between input and output charge densities became less than @xmath17electrons / a.u.@xmath18    the calculated total energy - volume ( @xmath19-@xmath20 ) data were fitted to the birch - murnaghan equation of states  @xcite which enables us to calculate the enthalpy @xmath21 , where @xmath19 is the internal energy , @xmath22 is the external pressure , and @xmath20 is the volume of the system .",
    "all calculations were carried out for nonmagnetic ( nm ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) states at different volumes .",
    "the optimized lattice parameters of @xmath0-fese were calculated to be @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and volume / atom ratio @xmath25 with the gga ( lsda ) results which are comparable to the recent experimental values  @xcite . the calculated internal coordinates and the formula unit volumes of the considered crystals at individual equilibria are summarized in table [ atomic ] .",
    "we carefully checked that the physics of these systems does not depend on the details of internal parameter values .",
    "in fig .  [ t - path ] , one can see that @xmath0-fese is the most stable structure and under sufficient volume contraction ( external pressure ) , @xmath0-fese becomes unfavorable compared to the other phases of fese . around the equilibrium volume of @xmath0-fese",
    "all other phases are in metastable states by an energy barrier per formula unit ( f.u . ) of order @xmath26 .",
    "as we compress the unit cell volume , @xmath0-fese goes to a higher energy state and nias - type fese becomes a stablized phase .",
    "nm @xmath0-fese starts to cross fm nias - type fese at a volume of @xmath27 .",
    "further compression transits @xmath0-fese to the nm nias - type phase at @xmath28 , but before crossing the nm nias - type fese phase , @xmath0-fese crosses the energy curve of mnp - type fese .",
    "hence , a slight compression deforms nias - type fese to mnp - type fese , where the hexagonal symmetry is broken and can be viewed as a distorted nias structure .",
    "we can also see that nm @xmath0-fese begins to overcome fm mnp - type fese at about @xmath29 and nm mnp - type fese at about @xmath30 .",
    "nias - type fese can be transformed to cscl - type fese if we push the se atom to the center of the unit cell and simultaneously deform the @xmath13 and @xmath31 axes of the hexagonal lattice to a cubic lattice under a large external pressure , to break the bonds between fe and se atoms in the hexagonal structure for making new bonds in the cubic structure .",
    "in other words , tetragonal @xmath0-fese can be thought of as a distorted cscl - type fese with an elongated @xmath32 axis .",
    "hence , one can naturally expect a transition to cscl - type fese at high pressure corresponding . on the other hand ,",
    "mnp - type fese is a distorted structure where phase transition to cscl - type fese will require larger pressure as compare to nias - type fese .",
    "although cuau - type fese lies much higher in energy , extrapolating @xmath0-fese to a small volume region tells us that @xmath0-fese can enter into a metastable region at @xmath33 and cuau - type fese may become a stable structure . however , the common tangent does not pass through both curves which makes difficult the @xmath0-fese to cuau - type fese transition .",
    "we must note that fig .",
    "[ t - path ] can give an indication of structural phase transitions of @xmath0-fese under pressure , and the volumes discussed above are the critical volumes at which @xmath0-fese crosses the binding curve of the other phases , _",
    "e.g. _ nias - type fese    the above discussion revealed the relative structural stability of @xmath0-fese .",
    "however , to have complete understanding of the phase transition of @xmath0-fese , we calculated the transition pressures .",
    "the transition pressures ( @xmath34 ) from @xmath0-fese to the other structure , _",
    "e.g. _ , nias - type fese , can be obtained either from the slope of the common tangent of both @xmath19-@xmath20 curves in fig .",
    "[ t - path ] or from the usual condition of equal enthalpies , _",
    "i.e. _ , the pressure @xmath34 at which the enthalpies @xmath35 of @xmath0-fese and nias - type fese are the same .",
    "we follow the latter approach , since it is well known that the thermodynamic stable phase at some given pressure and zero temperature is that one with the minimum enthalpy  @xcite . at @xmath34 ,",
    "two phases have the same enthalpy , and then the transition pressure is determined by equating the enthalpies of the two phases of fese .",
    "note that this is a standard procedure to calculated the transition pressure of materials  @xcite . to see the possible phase transitions , fig .",
    "[ pressure ] shows the calculated enthalpy curve of @xmath0-fese , nias- , and mnp - type fese as a function of @xmath22 .    following the above procedure",
    ", the transition pressures of fese are calculated and the results are summarized in table  [ ptable ] . the gga ( lsda ) @xmath36 of @xmath0-fese to nias - type fese is calculated to be @xmath37 , whereas @xmath34 of @xmath0-fese to mnp - type fese is @xmath38 which are in agreement with recent experimental reports  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a slight external pressure deforms the hexagonal structure to the orthorhombic one .",
    "the experimental reports state that structural phase transition from @xmath0-fese to mnp - type requires @xmath39 more extra pressure than does nias - type  @xcite .",
    "our calculations follow the same trend and the gga ( lsda ) results demonstrate that @xmath40 extra pressure than nias - type is required for the mnp - type fese .",
    "we also calulated the transition pressure of @xmath0-fese to cscl - type fese which is @xmath41gpa . therefore , our calculations reveal that @xmath0-fese takes transition to nias - type fese , mnp - type fese , and cscl - type fese at high pressure irrespective of their magnetic structures .",
    "the predictions are in excellent agreement with recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "table  [ ptable ] also shows that there is a possibility of a phase transition from nias - type to cscl - type fese at @xmath42 gpa .",
    "we can see that it is easier for @xmath0-fese to take transition to nias- and then to mnp - type fese .",
    "however , large external pressure @xmath43 gpa is required for mnp - type to cscl - type fese phase transition .",
    "further recent experimental observation found cscl - type fes  @xcite , which is isoelectronic to fese , at high pressure and this supports the expectation of cscl - type fese  @xcite .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments per fe atom ( @xmath44 ) are shown in fig .  [ mmgga ] .",
    "we did not find any magnetism in @xmath0-fese in the whole volume range , which is in agreement with recent first - principles calculations  @xcite and experiment  @xcite .",
    "the steps in @xmath44 of nias - type fese indicate that the magnetism of fese is sensitive to volume compression and expansion . below the volume of @xmath45",
    ", nias - type fese has zero magnetic moment and the onset of magnetization can be seen for volumes greater than @xmath45 ; the small step in @xmath44 is due to the onset of magnetization .",
    "once the magnetization develops , @xmath44 increases slightly and has a constant slope in the volume region @xmath46@xmath47 ; this is the region where mnp - type fese is more stable in energy than nias - type fese .",
    "the step in @xmath44 happens at @xmath48 , because near this volume the hexagonal fese is more stable in energy than tetragonal fese .",
    "interestingly , similar steps in @xmath44 can also be seen for mnp - type fese , where the onset of magnetization shifts to a higher volume region as compared with nias - type fese , _",
    "i.e. _ , the onset of magnetization starts at @xmath49 , exactly at this volume that the fm mnp - type enters into fm nias - type fese",
    ". then @xmath44 increases with increasing lattice volume and the change in slope can be seen around the volume region where @xmath0-fese crosses the energy curve of mnp - type fese .",
    "the cuau - type fese has zero @xmath44 for volumes @xmath50 and @xmath44 monotonically increases with the lattice volume .",
    "cscl - type fese is more interesting due to its nonzero @xmath44 in the whole region of volume and this may indicate that while even all the phases of fese become nm , cscl - type fese retains its magnetic structure in an unconventional manner  @xcite .",
    "the phase transitions mentioned are understood by comparing the electronic structures in terms of the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the calculated total and atom projected dos in the fm states are shown in fig .",
    "the total dos of @xmath0-fese shows metallic behavior which is in agreement with recent photoemission and transport measurements  @xcite .",
    "the exchange splitting is absent in @xmath0-fese and the se @xmath22-states lie well below the fermi energy ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the se @xmath22-states are hybridized with the fe @xmath52-states and this hybridization is strong at a lower energy , @xmath53 .",
    "the strong peak near @xmath51 is formed mainly from the fe @xmath54-states , and the fe @xmath55-states are more delocalized in energy and extend over a wide range of energy .",
    "the dos shows that @xmath51 is dominated by the fe @xmath52-states , which is also found in recent experimental results on @xmath0-fese  @xcite and the feas superconductor  @xcite .",
    "one can also see a pseudogap in the electronic structure of @xmath0-fese which was also found in previous calculations  @xcite and in the feas based superconductor  @xcite .",
    "this reveals that the electronic structure of @xmath0-fese is essentially similar to those of feas based superconductors .",
    "the nias - type fese dos in fig .",
    "[ dos](b ) shows a metallic property and now there is an exchange splitting between the majority and minority spins , which was absent in @xmath0-fese .",
    "therefore , the structural phase transition is accompanied by a magnetic phase transition .",
    "simultaneously , the fe local symmetry is also changed from tetrahedral to octahedral .",
    "the se @xmath22-states extend to lower energies and strongly hybridize mainly with the fe @xmath55-states .",
    "furthermore , now there is no pseudogap in the majority spins , but it exists in the minority spin states .",
    "the peak at @xmath56 is contributed by the fe @xmath55-states .",
    "this switch of @xmath54 to @xmath55 states is due to the change of local symmetry .",
    "once the local symmetry of the fe atom is changed to hexagonal ( octahedral ) , further breaking of hexagonal symmetry will not have much affect on the electronic structure as seen in mnp - type fese dos in fig .",
    "[ dos](c ) .",
    "the electronic structure is identical to nias - type fese except for some minor changes around @xmath51 in the majority and minority spins . in the majority spins",
    ", @xmath51 lies in the valley ; in the case of minority spins , the splitting between the @xmath55 and @xmath54 states at @xmath51 is increased and this is probably due to the breaking of hexagonal symmetry .    in the case of nias - type fese ,",
    "these minority spin states were nearly degenerate , but the lattice distortion removes this degeneracy and the @xmath54-states move to higher energy in mnp - type fese , lower the electronic energy and @xmath51 falls in the valley .",
    "one can see that the lattice distortion significantly decreased the dos at @xmath51 , and the mnp - type fese has a lower dos at @xmath51 than does nias - type fese .",
    "in the case of cscl - type fese , the majority fe @xmath54-states are completely occupied and the @xmath55-states are partially occupied .",
    "metallic conduction is mainly taken by the @xmath55 spins in the majority as well as in the minority spin states . the total dos shows the mixing of the fe-@xmath52 and se-@xmath22 states .",
    "the total dos of cuau - type fese also shows metallic character ; the hybridization between the fe-@xmath52 and se-@xmath22 electrons can be seen .",
    "note that both the @xmath55 and @xmath54 spins are completely occupied in the majority states .",
    "the exchange splitting between the @xmath55 and @xmath54 spins in the majority state is weaker than in the minority spin states . as we saw that our calculated systems are metallic in in low and high pressure regions and the electronic structures agree with the previous experimental and theoretical data which suggest us that the effect of onsite coulomb interaction , i.e. , lda+u type interaction in fese will not have significant affects .    to shed more light on the structural phase transition of @xmath0-fese and to see how the chemical bonding changes , the charge densities were also calculated and plotted in fig .",
    "[ cdn ] in a plane that contains both the fe and se atoms .",
    "the @xmath0-fese phase forms an enhanced density on the side of the fe atom .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0-fese bonds are more covalent , a bonding that causes the apparent deviation of the charge density contours from a spherical shape .",
    "inside the fe - se block , the metal - like fe - fe ( se - se ) bonding occurs due to delocalized fe @xmath57 ( se @xmath22 ) states .",
    "interestingly , similar bonding was also found in the feas superconductors  @xcite .",
    "note that such a bonding is either absent or weak in the other crystal structures of fese .",
    "the structural transition to nias - type fese also changes the bonding character between the fe and se atoms .",
    "the charge density of nias - type fese , see fig .",
    "[ cdn](b ) , clearly shows that the bonding between the fe and se atoms is less covalent and the charges are more localized at fe and se atoms and are nearly spherical .",
    "the bonding in mnp - type fese is similar to the nias - type fese . in the cscl - type fese and cuau - type fese ,",
    "the bonding becomes more ionic and the charge density becomes nearly spherical .",
    "it is obvious that the ionic interaction between the fe - se bonds becomes stronger and the covalent interaction becomes weaker , when the structural phase transition occurs from @xmath0-fese to the other phases of fese .",
    "we must note that the role of defects ( se or fe vacancies ) in fese can not be ignored and such defects , which are usually in high energy states , may change the magnetic structure of fese  @xcite .",
    "the effect of se / fe vacancies on the structural phase transition of fese is beyond the scope of the present work",
    ".    there might be a relation between superconductivity and covalency because @xmath0-fese is more covalent than the other phases of fese , which have not yet shown superconductivity .",
    "the ground state structure of fese is nm @xmath0-fese and it does not show any magnetic or structural instability at zero pressure .",
    "the experimentally observed decrease in the @xmath1 of @xmath0-fese at high pressure  @xcite might be due to a structural / magnetic instability because our calculations show that there is a structural and magnetic instability under high pressure and a structural phase transition takes place to non - superconducting fese , _",
    "e.g. _ , nias - type fese .",
    "although their is no concensus on the mechanism of the observed superconductivity of @xmath0-fese , the fermi surface topology plays a crucial role  @xcite for forming the mediating quasi - particles for cooper pairs as in cuprates  @xcite .",
    "once @xmath0-fese transformed into the other structures , such fermi surface topology and the corresponding van hove singlularity near the fermi surface will not be maintained anymore .",
    "therefore , the decrease in @xmath1 at high pressure may be due a structural / magnetic instability .",
    "this suggests that we may increase the @xmath1 of fese , if such a structural phase transition at high pressure is avoided .",
    "it may be suggested that the structural phase transition in @xmath0-fese can be controlled by doping  @xcite .",
    "further work is necessary to control this phase transition or increase the transition pressure of @xmath0-fese .",
    "using _ ab initio _ calculations , we showed the phase transition of superconducting @xmath0-fese .",
    "the predicted structural phase transition and transition pressure were shown to be in excellent agreement with existing experimental observations .",
    "our calculations also showed that there is also a structural phase transition from nias - type to mnp - type and cscl - type fese .",
    "phase transition from mnp - type to cscl - type fese requires larger pressure than nias - type fese .",
    "the electronic structure and charge density were similar to the feas based superconductors .",
    "the calculations revealed that the covalent bond between fe and se becomes weaker and the ionic bond become stronger when @xmath0-fese is transformed to other structures .",
    "the experimentally observed decrease in @xmath1 at high pressure of @xmath0-fese may be due to a structure / magnetic instability .",
