    "the appearance of a directed flow induced by a zero - mean monochromatic force is a generic nonequilibrium phenomenon known as the ratchet effect ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ratchet transport at nanoscale attracts a significant interest in last years ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the electron ratchet currents induced by a monochromatic _ ac-_driving have been experimentally observed in asymmetric mesoscopic structures at high @xcite , very low @xcite and ghz @xcite frequencies . in",
    "the later experiments the ratchet effect was visible even at room temperatures but these experiments were lacking a detailed analysis of magnetic field resonance effects , typical of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a magnetic field @xcite and a dependence study of ratchet current on microwave polarization .",
    "we note that the presence of resonances in a resistivity dependence on a magnetic field and polarization dependence of ratchet transport ensure that a voltage induced by a microwave radiation appears due to an asymmetry of lattice structure and not due to other asymmetries potentially present in an experimental devices .",
    "the theoretical studies of 2deg deterministic ratchet transport on a semidisk galton board has been started in @xcite and further extended in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies show that the ratchet effect exists not only for 2deg but also for electrons in graphene plane with oriented semidisk lattice @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations and analytical theory developed in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite have been done for noninteracting electrons .",
    "they established that a directed chaotic deterministic ratchet transport emerges in such asymmetric nanostructures due to microwave radiation .",
    "the direction of ratchet current can be controlled by the radiation polarization .",
    "the theoretical studies show that the ratchet effect also exists in a presence of moderate and strong interactions between electrons @xcite .",
    "the theoretical works initiated the detailed experimental studies of the chaotic deterministic ratchet 2deg transport on the semidisk galton board of antidots performed by grenoble group @xcite .",
    "these experiments clearly demonstrated the existence of ratchet transport in a high mobility 2deg based on algaas / gaas heterojunstions with semidisk array .",
    "the polarization dependence of ratchet current is found to be in a qualitative agreement with the theory dependence for noninteracting electrons .",
    "it is also experimentally shown @xcite that the ratchet is absent in arrays with circular antidots ensuring that the effect is produced by semidisks and not by always present device asymmetries .",
    "more recently the grenoble group performed ratchet experiments with 2deg in si / sige heterostructures @xcite where the interaction effects between electrons are expected to play more important role @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of these experiments is the dependence of ratchet transport on a magnetic field in presence of interactions .",
    "thus it is important to understand the properties of ratchet of interacting particles in a magnetic field which creates a symmetry breaking in space and time .",
    "we note that previously the theoretical investigations were done only for noninteracting electrons in a magnetic field @xcite or for interacting electrons without magnetic field @xcite .",
    "thus in this work we perform a more general study analyzing the properties of ratchet transport in presence of interactions and magnetic field .",
    "indeed , an applied magnetic field induces a chiral movement of charge in a conducting sample .",
    "this chirality may be revealed in optical measurements such as the faraday effect @xcite .",
    "an emergence of a static magnetization due to an _",
    "ac-_electric field is known as the inverse faraday effect ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , one can expect that transport properties of a chiral structure will strongly depend on the sign of magnetic field .",
    "however , this argument , based on spatial symmetries , should also take into account that the equilibrium transport measurements are also constrained by the time reversal symmetry that implies onsager - casimir reciprocity relations @xcite .",
    "due to these relations a two terminal conductance is always symmetric with magnetic field masking the chirality .",
    "however , since the time reversal symmetry is valid only for equilibrium samples , it can be destroyed for measurements in a nonlinear transport regime .",
    "the appearance of magnetic field asymmetry in a nonlinear two terminal transport , has attracted a significant theoretical and experimental attention in the mesoscopic physics community .",
    "indeed , a microscopic disorder potential has no symmetry , and the absence of self - averaging in coherent samples makes such investigations possible .",
    "surprisingly , even if all symmetries are broken in the out of equilibrium regime theoretical calculations predict that interactions are required to observe a magnetic field antisymmetric component in nonlinear conductance .",
    "while measurements on coherent samples seem to support these predictions , measurements on samples with artificial asymmetric structures may produce asymmetric ( or even antisymmetric ) nonlinear transport even in regimes where interactions do not seem to play a role ( for e.g. high density ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the investigations of ratchet transport in presence of interactions and magnetic field will allow us to analyze the onsager - casimir reciprocity relations in a new frame .    in order to gain a deeper insight on the symmetry properties of nonlinear transport ,",
    "we investigate numerically an interacting two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with a periodic array of asymmetric ( semidisk ) antidots oriented in a preferential direction using the square lattice of oriented semidisks discussed in @xcite . in this model a semidisk of radius @xmath0 is placed in a square of size @xmath1 and then this square covers periodically the whole @xmath2 plane ( see inset of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we consider @xmath3 a homogeneous monochromatic @xmath3 linearly polarized @xmath3 electric field @xmath4 .",
    "this field creates a rectified current flow due to the asymmetric structure of the antidot superlattice .",
    "the direction of the flow can be controlled by the polarization of the microwave field and by a magnetic field perpendicular to the 2deg plane .",
    "the quantitative description of the ratchet current can be obtained on the basis of kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "however this theory rapidly breaks down in presence of a magnetic field since it does not capture the particle dynamics when cyclotron radius becomes of the order of the antidot radius .",
    "moreover it was shown recently @xcite that interactions could strongly modify the rectified current , hence this system allows to investigate in detail the role of interactions on the magnetic field symmetry properties of the nonlinear response .",
    "in fact , we show that the antisymmetric component of the rectified current can be splitted in two terms .",
    "one term is weakly dependent on interactions and can be interpreted as a hall drift of the rectified current in the preferential direction fixed by the semidisk superlattice .",
    "the second term vanishes in absence of interactions as predicted by theories @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "hence , depending on the measurement geometry , the antisymmetric component of the rectified current may vanish or not in absence of interactions .",
    "in this work we consider a 2deg with elastic semidisk scatterers of radius @xmath0 , oriented in direction @xmath5 , and placed in a periodic square lattice of size @xmath6 ( see inset of fig  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the electron motion is affected by an electric microwave field @xmath7 linear polarized at angle @xmath8 to @xmath9 , and a transverse , uniform and constant magnetic field @xmath10 ( inversely proportional to the larmor radius @xmath11 ) .",
    "the system also interacts with a nos  hoover thermostat which equilibrates the ensemble of particles to the boltzmann distribution with temperature @xmath12 in a characteristic time @xmath13 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the electron interactions are treated in the frame of the mesoscopic multi - particle collision model proposed by kapral ( see e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the method consists in dividing the coordinate space of each square of size @xmath6 with @xmath14 particles in @xmath15 collision cells .",
    "inside each cell the collisions are mimic with a rotation of all particle velocities on a random angle in the moving center - of - mass frame , preserving the total momentum and energy of the system .",
    "these rotations are done with a repetition period given by a characteristic time @xmath16 . in this way",
    "large and small values of @xmath16 correspond to weak and strong interactions respectively . in this work",
    "we follow our previous studies of interactions effects on ratchet transport @xcite where the interactions were treated in the frame of kapral approach .     in direction @xmath17 as a function of a magnetic field",

    "the electric field is linearly polarized in @xmath17 axis ( @xmath20 ) with amplitude and frequency @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the temperature of hoover thermostat is @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the interactions between electrons goes from strong interaction regime ( @xmath25 ) to weak interactions ( @xmath26 ) as it is shown on legend .",
    "the inset panel shows the directions of electric and magnetic fields in a general case , and the distribution of semidisk periodic array with an orientation direction in @xmath27 axis .",
    "the geometric ratio is fixed at @xmath28 as it is shown on the inset .",

    "therefore the only parameter controlling the interaction strength is the inverse kapral time @xmath35 .",

    "the amplitude of ratchet current becomes rather small since the larmor radius becomes smaller than the distance between semidisks .",
    "thus the data of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] also show that the asymmetry of ratchet transport appears only in a presence of interactions .",
    "in this work we study the symmetry properties of the ratchet transport on an oriented semidisk antidot superlattice .",
    "we show that while the ratchet flow on the oriented semidisk superlattice ( along @xmath85axis ) does not depend on the sign of magnetic field for a noninteracting 2deg , interactions can give rise to an antisymmetric component of the flow in the semidisk direction as a function of a magnetic field .",
    "this result is consistent with the case of mesoscopic samples where deviations from onsager - casimir reciprocity relations were shown to occur only in presence of electron - electron interactions @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the flow perpendicular to the semidisk direction ( @xmath87axis ) is asymmetric even when interactions are absent .",
    "we argue that the origin of this component of the flow is a hall drift of the rectified current .",
    "this contribution is absent in disordered mesoscopic samples because the translational symmetry is broken by a disorder potential where no preferential direction is present for the flow .    the comparison with @xcite,@xcite,@xcite highlights various aspects of these skillful experiments . at weak electron - electron interactions typical of algaas / gaas hererojunctions",
    "@xcite there is a qualitative agreement between the theory and experiment on polarization dependence and approximately symmetric current response on sign change of a magnetic field , even if the absolute quantitative values differ from theoretical predictions ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . for experiments with si / sige heterostructures",
    "@xcite the effects of interactions are stronger and asymmetric response in a magnetic field is clearly observed in experiments ( see e.g. fig.3 in @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the change of polarization from @xmath37 to @xmath20 does not change the sign of photovoltage that also appears in theoretical models at strong interactions as discussed in @xcite .",
    "also the ratchet effect is clearly suppressed in experiment and theory at large magnetic fields . however , at the same time there are significant differences between experiments @xcite and theoretical results presented here .",
    "indeed , for @xmath20 the theory predicts a change of the photovoltage sign upon inversion of the magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] above ) while there is no such sign change in experiments ( see e.g. fig.3 in @xcite and in @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that finite sample size leads to a certain charge accumulation in the experimental setup ( see indications for that in fig.4 in @xcite ) that may explain the difference with the theory where the analysis is done for an infinite lattice size .",
    "we should also note that the present studies were done for a square lattice of semidisks while in the experiments @xcite were performed on an hexagonal lattice of semidisks .",
    "however , in both cases the density of semidisks is relatively low ( since @xmath28 here and @xmath88 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the ratchet transport is created mainly by scattering on a one semidisk ( see discussion in @xcite ) and the difference between square and hexagonal lattices is not expected to be important .",
    "the discussed caparison between the present theoretical studies and the most advanced experiments reported in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite shows that the further experimental and theoretical research of the electron ratchet transport in asymmetric nanostructures with dynamical chaos represents a significant fundamental scientific interest .",
