    "the lz problem is exactly solvable and the final survival probability of the adiabatic state can be obtained asymptotically@xcite .",
    "lz transitions have attracted considerable interest both theoreticallyand experimentally@xcite .",
    "it has been used to model dynamical processes in a variety of physical systemsatoms , bec .",
    "for instance , with superconducting circuits , which can behave as controllable quantum two - level systems , lz and landau - zener - stckelberg problems were studied by several groupssuper1,super2,super3,super4 .",
    "lz processes controlled by classical or quantized light fields were also studied in@xcite .",
    "the influence of environment on quantum systems has motivated numerous studies on the dissipative lz problem .",
    "exact results are available at zero temperature@xcite , analytical discussions based on perturbation expansions were derived inlz - dephasing , lz - longwen , and various numerical methods were employed for the finite - temperature situations@xcite .",
    "the non - monotonic dependence of the lz transition probability on the sweep rate was studied in@xcite using a numerically exact method .",
    "environment parameters , such as temperature , can exponentially enhance the coherent oscillations generated at a lz transition@xcite .",
    "transversal system - bath interactions were found to influence the survival probability more strongly than longitudinal system - bath interactions@xcite .    put in a more general perspective , the manipulation of instantaneous eigenstates of a quantum system along its adiabatic paths can be very useful . in order to avoid nonadiabatic transitions ,",
    "the operation has to be executed over a long time scale .",
    "unavoidably , however , a slower process would allow more unwanted decoherence effects induced by an environment .",
    "hence , on the one hand a process should be slow such that the system can stay close to adiabatic states . on the other hand",
    ", the process should be fast so that not too much decoherence can set in before an adiabatic process ends .",
    "this conflict makes it necessary to have a highly reliable treatment of open quantum systems , which can handle , for example , long - time evolutions and sometimes strong system - bath couplings .",
    "usually , the description of the dynamics of open systems starts with a perturbative theory and involves various approximations , such as the born , markov and rotating - wave approximation  ( rwa ) .",
    "an efficient method that avoids the above approximations was developed by tanimura _",
    "et al_. @xcite , who established a set of hierarchical equations that includes all orders of system - bath interactions .",
    "the hierarchy equation method has been successfully employed to describe the quantum dynamics of various physical , chemical and biophysical systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the hierarchy equation method can be used to study the dynamics of qubit devices operating at low temperatures@xcite , when the environment is usually modelled by a lorentz - broadened cavity mode .",
    "for these reasons , we shall use the hierarchy equation method to exactly study lz processes under the influence of an environment .",
    "in particular , we focus on finite - time lz processes coupled to an environment .",
    "we shall also vary the system - bath coupling strength from weak to arbitrarily strong regimes , observing a non - monotonic dependence of the survival fidelity on the coupling strength .",
    "this result indicates that a finite - time lz process can behave much differently from the more idealized lz process that starts and ends with an infinite energy bias  @xcite .    to shorten the time scale of a useful quantum adiabatic operation , various protocols",
    "have been proposed to suppress the nonadiabatic transitions with additional control fields .",
    "such protocols are often called counter - diabatic  ( cd ) driving , shortcuts to adiabaticity , or transitionless driving  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we refer to all such quantum control strategies as cd drivings .",
    "some of them have been implemented in harmonic systems@xcite , atom transport@xcite , quantum computingcd - quant - comp , quantum simulations@xcite , many - body state engineering@xcite , cooling of nanomechanical resonators@xcite , and so on .",
    "cd drivings have also been suggested as a way to improve the performance of quantum heat engines  @xcite , although with due attention to the cost of using them  @xcite .",
    "recently , cd driving was also considered in open systems cd - open-1,cd - open-4 . however , these studies were based on a simplified treatment of the environment .    in this work",
    "we investigate the effectiveness of different cd driving protocols in boosting the fidelity values of lz processes in the presence of an environment .",
    "our investigation is the first of this kind without making any approximations . from our numerically exact results",
    ", it is found that not all cd driving fields can perform well in the presence of decoherence . while in the fast driving limit",
    "( the associated cd driving field will have extremely large peak values ) all cd driving fields can expectedly do a good job , in the cases with intermediate sweep rates , the addition of a cd driving field may even degrade the fidelity . the specific implementation of a cd driving field may also have a large impact on the fidelity . these results clearly show that if the total time scale of an adiabatic process can not be made very short ( e.g. , due to hardware implementations or the bandwidth limit of the cd driving ) , then the introduction of an additional control field , whose aim is mainly to suppress the system - environment coupling , can still be of interest . in the literature a control field capable of modulating and hence suppressing the system - bath coupling is often called a dynamical decoupling  ( dd ) field  @xcite . using a case study at the end of this work , we indeed discuss the possibility of combining a cd driving field with a dd field together .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we introduce the model system and the hierarchy equation method . in sec.iii we show the numerical results of our finite - time lz dynamics under the influence of an environment . in sec.iv ,",
    "two types of cd drivings are considered and compared . in sec.v",

    ", we can study the cases of different sweeping rates .",
    "here , one should note the difference between the form of eq.([zt ] ) and the conventional lz driving , i.e. , @xmath20 . in the latter , changing the evolution time interval is equivalent to changing the boundary of the bias - energy .",
    "note also that in pure theoretical considerations , an infinite time interval , i.e. , @xmath21 is often chosen because it allows greater analytical insight , however this implies an infinite energy bias and is not adopted here .",

    "the ( red ) solid line displays the case without environment ( @xmath110 ) , wherein a high final fidelity is found .",
    "this high fidelity can be attributed to the slow sweeping rate of @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , which gives a large ratio of @xmath113 .",

    "@xcite a fundamental requirement was that the process was conducted for an infinite evolution time , i.e. , @xmath137 .",
    "this implies that the initial and final energy bias of the qubit system must be infinitely large as compared with an arbitrarily strong system - bath coupling .",
    "in contrast , our finite - time lz process involves situations for which the system - bath couplings are comparable to the energy bias at the start or in the end . for this reason , a complicated interplay between non - adiabatic transitions and environment - induced excitation or de - excitation can be expected . to confirm this insight",
    ", we note that for the studied range of the system parameters , the nonmonotonic behavior discussed above emerges only when the sweeping rate yields a time scale that is comparable with that associated with environment induced transitions .",

    "it requires @xmath189 , with @xmath190 and @xmath191 , with the transformed cd driving hamiltonian given by @xmath192 \\frac{\\sigma _ { z}}{2}+p\\left ( t\\right ) \\frac{\\sigma _ { x}}{2 } ,   \\label{cd_transformed}\\ ] ] where @xmath193 ,  @xmath194 $ ] and @xmath195 . as seen above",
    ", the main interesting feature of this transformed cd driving is that it does not contain @xmath196 and hence it is more analogous to the original @xmath29 hamiltonian .",
    "it is now of great interest to compare the performance of the transformed cd driving with that of the above - studied cd driving , in the presence of an environment .",
    "panel ( a ) of fig.4 shows the fidelity with instantaneous adiabatic states versus scaled time , with @xmath197 . somewhat expected , before the lz process is over the fidelity of transformed cd is systematically smaller .",
    "interestingly , this difference sustains at the end of the lz process .",
    "that is , the final fidelity of the transformed cd is not as satisfactory as that of cd .",
    "panel ( b ) fig.4 compares the final fidelity values as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "clearly , for the whole shown range of system - bath coupling strength , transformed cd is less effective than cd in reaching the final target state ( though in the unitary limit these two driving strategies give the same final result by construction ) .",
    "however , it remains an open question to see if it is possible for a transformed cd driving to be more robust against an environment than a default cd driving .",
    "our results in previous sections clearly show that , so long as the quantum adiabatic operation is not very short , the presence of an environment poses a hurdle to realizing perfect adiabatic operations even with cd driving .",
    "we are thus motivated to consider a simple dynamical decoupling ( dd ) protocol to suppress the effect of system - bath coupling .",
    "this is highly nontrivial because in general , the introduction of a dd field can easily interfere with the design of cd driving .",
    "this section hence serves as a starting point to motivate further studies on this interesting problem .    for completeness",
    ", we first briefly introduce continuous dd , which is based on a continuous control hamiltonian , denoted as @xmath198 , to effectively reduce system - bath coupling @xcite .",
    "the total system - bath hamiltonian is hence given by @xmath199a unitary transformation @xmath200 generated by @xmath198 alone can be expressed as @xmath201 .\\]]in continuous dd , @xmath202 satisfies two conditions .",
    "first , @xmath202 should be periodic in time with a period denoted by @xmath203 , i.e.,@xmath204second , @xmath205the mechanism of continuous dd can then be easily understood . in particular",
    ", one may use @xmath198 as a reference hamiltonian to define an interaction representation or a rotating frame . in that representation ,",
    "the total hamiltonian becomes @xmath206 .",
    "the associated total system - bath propagator becomes @xmath207 .\\]]dividing the total time interval @xmath208 into @xmath209 pieces of width @xmath210 ( @xmath209 is a positive integer number ) and using the magnus expansion to the first order of @xmath211 @xcite , one has @xmath212   \\notag \\\\ & \\approx & \\prod\\limits_{n=1}^{n}\\exp \\left [ -i\\int_{(n-1)t_{d}}^{nt_{d}}% \\tilde{h}^{\\prime } \\left ( \\tau \\right ) d\\tau \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\]]due to the conditions in eqs.([dd - condition-1 ] ) and ( dd - condition-2 ) , terms with @xmath35 will vanish .",
    "that is , @xmath213d\\tau $ ]",
    ". then @xmath214 will factor into a product of independent evolution operators for the system and for the bath .",
    "note also that at @xmath215 , @xmath216 and hence @xmath217 is precisely the overall system - bath evolution operator in the original representation .",
    "that is , in the limit of @xmath218 , the system s evolution will completely decouple from that of the bath , with the evolution operator at @xmath215 given by @xmath219 $ ]    , with @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "other system and environment parameters are the same as in previous figures .",
    "( black ) dashed - dotted line represents a reference case , namely , cd driving without an environment , with @xmath168 .",
    "( red ) dashed line is for cd driving without dd , with the total hamiltonian given by @xmath222 .",
    "( blue ) solid line is for a case with `` cd+dd '' fields , with the total hamiltonian given by @xmath223.,scaledwidth=50.0%,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the dd mechanism explained above makes it clear that under a dd field , the effective system hamiltonian becomes that of @xmath224 . before switching on a dd field",
    ", @xmath225 is meant to implement a cd driving .",
    "but now with dd , can the effective hamiltonian @xmath226 still serve the purpose of cd driving or its variant ?",
    "this can be a complicated question .",
    "indeed , in general , @xmath200 might introduce transitions between different adiabatic states .",
    "however , this still does not exclude special solutions , one of which is discussed below .    because the system - bath coupling is of the @xmath42 form ,",
    "a suitable and simple choice of @xmath198 is @xcite @xmath227this dd hamiltonian tends to rapidly rotate the @xmath42 coupling and then average the system - bath coupling to zero . on the other hand , in sec .  iv a it is noted that @xmath228 [ see eq .",
    "( [ cd - key ] ) ] alone suffices to realize an adiabatic path precisely tracing the instantaneous adiabatic states of @xmath29 .",
    "that is , the hamiltonian @xmath29 itself , which only introduces a dynamical phase to the instantaneous adiabatic states , is not essential , and can hence be excluded , from the perspective of cd driving . remarkably then",
    ", if @xmath171 is simply chosen as @xmath152 , then both @xmath229 and @xmath171 are of the @xmath196 form , and so @xmath230 .",
    "therefore , at least in this special case of cd driving , a dd field is able to effectively decouple the system - bath coupling and at the same time retain the cd driving .    in fig.5 ,",
    "we present our computational results for a pure cddriving as well as a cd driving plus the above - introduced dd field , in terms of the fidelity with instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath29 . as a reference point",
    ", the ( black ) dashed - dotted line depicts the case without environment , whose fidelity stays at unity .",
    "we then switch on the system - bath coupling with @xmath231 .",
    "the ( blue ) solid line depicts the case with cd and dd , the oscillations in the fidelity are induced by @xmath232 and high fidelity values are reached periodically .",
    "the final fidelity @xmath233 is much higher than if only cd driving is used ( which gives @xmath234 shown in the red dashed line ) .",
    "we have also checked that if we let @xmath235 to realize an adiabatic operation in the presence of an environment , then turning on a dd field as described above will not help to improve the fidelity .",
    "theoretically , @xmath236 describes the rotation period of @xmath237 . in accord with the above theory of continuous dd ,",
    "only if @xmath238 is an integer , then one might achieve the best final fidelity . in the actual implementation ,",
    "e.g. , the ( blue ) solid line in fig.5 , the peak - value of the final fidelity occurs for @xmath239 instead of @xmath240 .",
    "this small deviation can be traced back to the approximations made in the first - order magnus expansion . note also that the associated dd field amplitude is @xmath241 in dimensionless units , whereas the peak amplitude of the cd driving field is about @xmath242 . by contrast , if we boost the final fidelity to @xmath243 by solely increasing the sweeping rate in the cd driving without using dd , the peak strength of the cd field will be as large as @xmath244 .",
    "that is to say , the use of a dd field is indeed helpful to battle against an environment in the realization of cd driving .",
    "in this work we have investigated finite - time landau - zener processes in the presence of an environment , which is modeled by a broadened cavity mode at zero temperature .",
    "such an environment model allows us to use the hierarchy equation method to obtain numerically exact results of the dynamics without any approximations .    the fidelity for the system to be found at the final target adiabatic state shows a non - monotonic dependence on the system - bath coupling strength and on the sweeping rate in the energy bias parameter .",
    "this signals an interesting competition between the otherwise unitary lz process and environment - induced relaxation and excitation .",
    "more importantly , it is found that an environment can affect the performance of cd driving significantly .",
    "if the lz process is not short enough , the addition of cd driving may lend more opportunities to the environment to degrade the performance even further .",
    "it is also found that different versions of cd driving can have different degrees of robustness against environment effects .",
    "our results indicate that more studies of cd driving in the presence of an environment will be fruitful . as a starting point , we discussed the possibility of combining cd driving with dynamical decoupling ( dd ) .",
    "at least for the simple case we investigated , it is possible to combine cd and dd to realize high - fidelity adiabatic manipulation in the presence of an environment , without requiring the process to be extremely fast .",
