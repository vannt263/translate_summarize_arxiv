    "@xcite studied a scheme for creating macroscopic entangled coherent states of separate nv ensembles that are coupled to a flux qubit .    in this paper , we study a hybrid quantum system , which consists of the nv ensembles and a large josephson junctions ( ljj ) , as shown in fig.[fi ] .",
    "the key point of our scheme is that the strong coupling between the ljj and the nv ensembles can be achieved . and",
    "a non - adiabatic holonomic single - qubit quantum gates is implemented .",
    "also , in the large detuning regime between ljj and nv ensembles , the ljj can induce the strong interaction of two spatially - separated nv ensembles .",

    "the operator @xmath22 can create symmetric dicke excitation states .",
