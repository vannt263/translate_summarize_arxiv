    "we also assume here that the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) has a pure @xmath49 component .",
    "this is due to the fact that the planet does not have an internal field , and that the imf direction does not seem to affect the o@xmath6 escape from venus @xcite .",

    "in ma13 , the changes in euv radiation over the solar cycle were considered with two cases for solar minimum and solar maximum .",
    "their model also included the radiation change with solar zenith angle ( sza ) .",
    "planets that reside in close - in orbits are expected to receive enhanced amounts of x - ray and euv radiation compared to the earth , venus , and even mercury . in order to consider the effect of this enhanced euv radiation , we scale the photoionization rates of the solar maximum case from ma13 with the distance square .",
    "the scaling parameter of venus s euv flux , @xmath50 , for the different cases is shown in the last column of tables  [ tab : t2 ] and [ tab : t3 ] .",
    "we stress that here we expect the enhanced euv radiation to simply increase the creation of ions via photoionization processes . in our simplified model for the atmosphere ,",
    "we do not account for the overall atmospheric heating due to the close proximity to the star ( since we are considering the habitable zones of m dwarfs , the optical and ir heating will be similar to the venus - earth - mars case ) , nor to the possible change in the electron temperature as a result of the creation of super - thermal electrons ( i.e. , we do not scale @xmath39 , @xmath47 , and @xmath51 with the euv flux ) .",
    "these effects can potentially lead to charge separation as the result of the change in ion and electron scale heights , and to additional acceleration and escape of atmospheric ions ( i.e. , the polar wind , * ? ? ?",
    "we leave the implementations of these processes in the model for future work .",
    "the model assumes a neutral planetary atmosphere source composed of carbon dioxide , which dominates below 160  km , and oxygen , which dominates above that height ( at venus ) .",

    "as seen from eq .",
    "[ continuity ] , we assume that the atmospheric chemistry is driven by these two neutral species , and it is governed by the photoionization , impact ionization , charge - exchange , and recombination processes described in table  [ tab : t1 ] . in future work , we plan to implement other species in order to study exoplanetary atmospheric environments .",
    "the densities for the ion species at the inner boundary are specified by the photochemical equilibrium .",
    "the inner boundary is set to absorb the velocity and magnetic field vectors .",
    "this guarantees that the magnetic field diffuses through the boundary with the help of the low conductivity ( as a result of the strong ion - neutral coupling at these low altitudes ) .",
    "the plasma temperature is assumed to be twice the ( venusian ) neutral temperature of 200 k. here we also neglect a potential increase of the neutral temperature due to close proximity to the star ( assuming that such an increase is possible considering the actual stellar radiation of m - dwarfs ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : f1 ] shows the model solutions in the y=0 and z=0 planes for all cases .",
    "the star is on the right , and the colored contours indicate the ratio of ionized oxygen ( o@xmath6+o@xmath7 ) to h@xmath6 densities .",
    "the planet is represented by a sphere and selected magnetic field lines and also shown .",
    "it can be seen that in all the cases , parts of the planetary environment are dominated by the oxygen ions over the hydrogen ions by factors of a few tenths ( and up to a thousand near the inner boundary ) .",
    "the exception is the case for 0.06  au with a super - alfvnic wind , which remains dominated by the stellar wind hydrogen population . in all other cases ,",
    "the lower parts of the atmosphere are completely occupied by oxygen , as are large regions in the planetary wake ( these are occasionally referred to as the `` induced magetosphere '' and `` induced magnetotail '' ) .",
    "a notable feature is that the oxygen - dominated regions are largely confined to the equatorial plain in most of the super - alfvnic cases , while these regions extend to lobes above and below the planet in the sub - alfvnic case .",
    "the super - alfvnic mercury case also shows similar structure due to the low alfveic mach number ( close to 2 ) in this case .",
    "the structure that eappears in the sub - alfvnic cases is typical for a body that moves in ambient plasma with sub - alfvnic speed , where the ambient field is perturbed by the body via a unique current system known as `` alfvn wings '' @xcite . in this topology , which has been studied in the context of the jovian moons of io and ganymede @xcite , two standing  lobes \" are created above and below the body . in our simulations , these lobes are filled with the oxygen ions that originate from the planetary atmosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2 ] shows the velocity distribution for all the cases on the y=0 ( meridional plain ) and the z=0 ( equatorial plain ) , together with the contour line at which the alfvnic mach number equals one .",
    "one can see that there is no bow shock in front of the planet for the sub - alfvnic cases , and that the stellar wind is directly slowed down to speeds of less than 100 km / s at a altitude of about 600 - 800 km at the sub - stellar point ( it is even lower in altitude at the planetary flanks ) . in the super - alfvnic cases ,",
    "a shock is formed at altitudes of at least twice this height , but the stellar wind incoming speeds are rather high ( about 100 km / s ) at much lower altitudes .",
    "another representation of the alfvn wing topology is the vertically extended planetary wake with very low speeds seen in figure  [ fig : f2 ] y=0 plains for the sub - alfvnic cases and the super - alfvnic cases with low alfvnic mach number ( 0.06au and mercury ) .",
    "the super - alfvnic cases with strong shock ( i.e. , high alfvnic mach number ) show a wake that is much more confined towards the equator .",
    "overall , all cases show regions around the planet with a very low flow speed , which indicates a stellar wind free zone .",
    "the velocity pattern in the sub - alfvnic cases shows that the flow is deflected to very large angles as the result of the standing vertical lobes . in the super - alfvnic cases",
    ", the flow simply goes around the planet , generating a slightly turbulent wake behind the planet in the slow speed tail region .",
    "figure  [ fig : f3 ] shows the total ion density , and the densities of the different ion species , as a function of altitude for all the cases .",
    "the densities are extracted from the planetary surface along the sub - stellar line ( x axis ) .",
    "the total ion density is dominated by h@xmath6 down to an altitude of 10001500 km , while below this height the atmospheric ions begin to dominate the ion density and peak around 300 km",
    ". the enhanced creation of atmospheric ions as a result of the increased euv flux is clearly reflected in an increase in ion densities as a function of decreasing orbital distance . the plots also show that the altitudes at which the densities of the atmospheric ions are comparable with the density of stellar wind h@xmath6 are located lower in the atmosphere for the super - alfvnic conditions compared to the sub - alfvnic conditions ( for the three close - in cases ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the stellar wind density is much higher for the super - alfvnic cases .",
    "the results of our simulations show that for close - in venus - like exoplanets , a very strong , direct interaction between the stellar wind and the upper atmosphere occurs at an altitude of no more than about one planetary radius ( a few thousand kilometers ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the few planetary radii for the case of magnetized planets presented in co14 .",
    "the results show a quite distinct topology of the plasma environment near the planet for the sub- and super - alfvnic stellar wind upstream conditions .",
    "this suggests that the space environment of close - in venus - like planet can be very dynamic as these planets pass between sub- to super - alfvnic plasma environments along their orbit ( as demonstrated dynamically in co14 but excluded here ) .",
    "therefore , through planetary orbital motion alone ( regardless of any stellar activity ) , the stellar wind can affect the planetary atmosphere in terms of different forms of energy deposition , such as ohmic dissipation , joule heating , and the generation of gravity waves .",
    "all these are expected due to the dynamic change of the induced ionosphere - magnetosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig : f4 ] shows the plasma radial speed as a function of altitude up to about 3 planetary radii for the magnetized planets from co14 and the non - magnetized planets studied here .",
    "the plot shows the cases corresponding to an orbital distance of 0.06  au .",
    "a negative sign of this speed component represents an inflow , while a positive sign represents an outflow .",
    "the plot clearly shows that for the magnetized planet cases , the inflow is already very weak far from the planet and there is even weak outflow in the sub - alfvnic case . in the case of non - magnetized planets ,",
    "the inflow slowly decreases for the super - alfvnic case ( this is the post - shock flow ) , and sharply decreases for the sub - alfvnic case .",
    "figure  [ fig : f5 ] shows the radial speed and the magnitude of the magnetic field as a function of altitude for all the non - magnetized venus - like cases .",
    "the values are extracted from the planetary surface along the sub - stellar line ( similar to figure  [ fig : f3 ] ) .",
    "the scale for the radial speed is designed to demonstrate the point at which the incoming wind gets to a complete stop ( inflow speed of less than 1 km / s ) . in both the sub- and super - alfvnic cases ,",
    "line 1 marks the point where the wind stops in the cases of venus , and line 2 marks the point where the wind stops in the case of the planet located at 0.06 au . in both cases ,",
    "the altitude difference is about 200 km and the wind penetrates up to an altitude of less than 600 km above the planetary surface .",
    "the magnetic field slowly increases as the result of the plasma compression in front of the planet , until a maximum is attained , and then starts to decrease to zero at an altitude of around 180  km for the case of distance of 0.06  au ( marked by line 3 ) .",
    "this point , which marks the decline of the magnetic field and represents the magnetic field - free planetary atmosphere is the same for all the cases of super - alfvnic wind conditions ( with the exception of the mercury case which is almost sub - alfvnic ) . in the sub - alfvnic cases ,",
    "this point moves outward as the planet gets further from the star , up to about 350  km for the mercury and venus cases .",
    "this difference is probably due to the fact that the stellar wind in the sub - alfvnic cases is much less dense than the super - alfvnic one .",
    "therefore , the compression region of the incoming stellar wind field , as well as the ability of the field to diffuse towards the atmosphere ( as the result of increased ion / electron density and their effect on the conductance and collision frequencies ) , are more sensitive to the oxygen outflow in the sub - alfvnic case than the super - alfvenic case .    to demonstrate the strong effect of the increased euv radiation , figure  [ fig : f6 ] shows the difference in the radial speed as a function of altitude for the case located at 0.06  au with and without scaling of the euv radiation with distance .",
    "the plot clearly shows that the enhanced radiation increases the production of atmospheric ion flux , which stops the stellar wind about 200 km higher than the case without increase euv flux .",
    "this increased ion flux also results in an enhanced compression of the magnetic field , even though it does not seem to affect the point at which the magnetic field starts to decrease .",
    "the model used here separates the densities of the different ions in the continuity equation but it does not distinguish between the different ion velocities and uses a single - fluid plasma velocity in the momentum , induction , and energy equation . since we do not have information about the particular ion velocities ,",
    "it is hard to estimate the escape rate of the different ions , in particular the o@xmath6 escape rate . in addition and as mentioned in section  [ sec : euvflux ] , the particular model used here does not account for any acceleration of the atmospheric ions via hydrodynamic acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ambipolar electric field @xcite , which is the main mechanism to explain the large amount of o@xmath6 observed in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite even found that the intense euv radiation increases the amount of ionized co@xmath12 and decrease the amount of neutral co@xmath12 . as a result , the atmospheric infrared ( ir )",
    "cooling is reduced as well and the atmosphere becomes over - inflated .",
    "however , this is a hydrodynamic , one - dimensional model that does not account for day - night energy transfer , electromagnetic effects , and it does not include the dynamic pressure of the incoming stellar wind at the top boundary .",
    "nevertheless , we can attempt to estimate a lower limit for the o@xmath6 escape rate by calculating the the integral of the mass flux through a sphere at a certain height , and include only the density points at which the radial velocity has both positive sign ( i.e. , outflow ) , and magnitude larger than venus s escape velocity of 10.36 km / s .",
    "figure  [ fig : f7 ] shows the loss rates of o@xmath6 for the different cases , integrated on spheres of @xmath54 , which is the altitude of the ion density peak , and @xmath55 , which is twice that height .",
    "the values are not always the same for the two heights as our assumption here does not conserves mass . in addition",
    ", some of the integrations result in zero as they do not include any outflow points with speeds above the escape velocity .",
    "the loss rates for the venus case are of the order of @xmath56 , and they are comparable with o@xmath6 loss rates observed by pioneer venus orbiter and venus express ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the escape rate is enhanced by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude for the close - in planets as the result of the enhanced euv photoionization .",
    "the mass loss rates translate to @xmath57 , with @xmath58 being the mass of the venusian atmosphere @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the o@xmath6 loss rates of the close - in planets are similar to those obtained for venus 4 gyr ago by @xcite , who calculated the venusian loss rate of o@xmath6 for different ages of the solar system ( taking into account the changes in the stellar radiation environment ) .",
    "the loss rates obtained by our simulations are much lower than the loss rates calculated for atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from hot jupiters ( @xmath59 e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the kepler-11 planets ) , hydrogen - dominated atmospheres are much more expanded compared to co@xmath12 atmospheres , so that the pressure balance between the stellar wind plasma and the hydrodynamically expanding upper atmosphere is much further up compared to the cases presented here .    in the case of a planet located at 0.06  au",
    ", the loss rate is much higher for the sub - alfvnic case comparing to the super - alfvnic case .",
    "this is because the strong , dense stellar wind in the super - alfvnic case suppresses the atmospheric oxygen outflow generated by the enhanced euv radiation ( see top - right panel of figure  [ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "the outflow is much more significant for the sub - alfvnic case , at which the stellar wind is less dense . for the cases of planets located at 0.085  au and 0.15  au",
    ", the loss rate is higher for the super - alfvnic cases comparing to the sub - alfvnic cases due to the slowdown of the stellar wind at the shock in front of the planet .",
    "this leaves more room for the atmospheric ions to outflow against the incoming wind .    at face value ,",
    "the loss rates estimated by our simulations mean that only a very small fraction of a venusian - like atmosphere will be lost over the course of a billion years .",
    "therefore , our simulations suggest that there is a good chance that the atmospheres of venus - like exoplanets orbiting m - dwarf stars are sustainable .",
    "nevertheless , the actual mass - loss rate may be significantly higher than these lower limits .",
    "the increase in ion scale - height due to increased euv photoionization may boost the ion density by an order of magnitude at high altitude .",
    "in addition , acceleration of ions at the upper atmosphere as a result of the polar wind can increase the ion velocity by another factor of 10 @xcite .",
    "this would mean instead that the planet may lose most of its atmosphere over the course of a billion years .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn by @xcite , who found that close - in terrestrial exoplanets may loose hundreds or even a thousand bars of their atmosphere due to the intense euv radiation and cme atmospheric erosion , even in the case where the planet has a strong internal magnetic field .",
    "more rigorous estimates of the atmospheric loss would require coupling of the model for the planetary space environment presented here with a model accounting for the structure of the upper atmosphere , that includes the acceleration of the atmospheric ions , the impact of the increased euv on the atmospheric temperatures and the atmospheric conductance , and a self - consistent photoionization model .",
    "such implementations are needed in order to provide a more accurate assessment of the ability of close - in exoplanets to sustain their atmospheres .",
    "we study the interaction between the atmospheres of venus - like , non - magnetized exoplanets orbiting m - dwarf stars and the stellar wind using a multi - species mhd model .",
    "we focus our investigation on the effect of enhanced stellar wind and enhanced euv flux as the planetary distance from the star decreases from venus s orbit at 0.72  au to close - in orbits located at 0.15 , 0.085 , and 0.06  au .",
    "for the close - in orbits , we study the interaction between sub- and super - alfvnic stellar wind conditions .",
    "we find that the two cases result in a very different configuration of the immediate planetary space environment , with the sub - alfvnic case resulting in vertically extended wake , while the super - alfvnic case produces a wake which is confined to the equatorial region .",
    "we expect that such dynamic change along the orbit of few days would deposit energy into the planetary atmosphere in the form of heating and the generation of gravity waves .",
    "the stellar wind penetration for the non - magnetized planets studied here is much deeper than the magnetized planets studied in co14 .",
    "it reaches altitudes of several hundreds of kilometers , in contrast to thousands in magnetized planets .",
    "as the planets reside closer to the star , the increase euv photoionization leads to an enhanced creation of ions that push the stellar wind stagnation point up by about 200 km compared to a low photoionization rate case .",
    "it also increases the compression of the stellar wind magnetic field in front of the planet .",
    "we estimate a lower limit for the o@xmath6 escape rate and find that the planetary atmosphere may be sustainable over the lifetime of the planet",
    ". however , the atmospheric escape rate could be much higher when additional acceleration mechanisms for the atmospheric ions are considered .",
    "we plan to implement these mechanisms in future work in order to better estimate the ability of venus - like exoplanets to sustain their atmospheres .",
    "we thank an unknown referee for his / her useful comments .",
    "the work presented here was funded by the smithsonian institution consortium for unlocking the mysteries of the universe grant lessons from mars : are habitable atmospheres on planets around m dwarfs viable? , the smithsonian institute competitive grants program for science ( cgps ) grant can exoplanets around red dwarfs maintain habitable atmospheres? , and by nasa astrobiology institute grant nnx15ae05 g .",
