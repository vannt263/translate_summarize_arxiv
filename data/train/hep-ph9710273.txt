    "actually decoupling is not an instantaneous process so the neutrinos are slightly heated by the subsequent @xmath22 annihilation , increasing the number density ( [ nnu ] ) by @xmath23 @xcite . ] ) however zeldovich @xcite and chiu @xcite concluded that relic neutrinos , although nearly as numerous as the blackbody photons , can not make an interesting contribution to the cosmological energy density since they are presumably massless .",
    "interestingly enough , some years earlier pontecorvo and smorodinski @xcite had discussed the bounds set on the cosmological energy density of mev energy neutrinos ( created e.g. by large - scale matter - antimatter annihilation ) using data from the reines  cowan and davis experiments .",
    "( they even suggested searching for gev energy neutrinos by looking for upward going muons in underground experiments ! ) not surprisingly these bounds were rather weak so these authors stated somewhat prophetically that ``  it is not possible to exclude a priori the possibility that the neutrino and antineutrino energy density in the universe is comparable to or larger than the average energy density contained in the proton rest mass '' . zeldovich and",
    "smorodinski @xcite noted that better bounds can be set by the limits on the total cosmological energy density @xmath24 ) following from the observed present expansion rate @xmath25 and age @xmath26 of the universe . where the hubble parameter @xmath27 , so @xmath28 .",
    "] of course they were still discussing _ massless _ neutrinos .",
    "weinberg @xcite even speculated whether a degenerate sea of relic neutrinos can saturate the cosmological energy density bound and noted that such a sea may be detectable by searching for ( scattering ) events beyond the end - point of the kurie plot in @xmath29-decay experiments !",
    "several years later , gershten and zeldovich @xcite made the connection that if relic neutrinos are massive , then a bound on the mass follows from requiring that @xmath30 . using the general relativistic constraint @xmath31 , they derived @xmath32 ( just assuming @xmath33 , i.e. that the universe is older than the earth ) and inferred that @xmath34  ev for a present photon temperature of @xmath35",
    ". unfortunately their calculation of the relic neutrino abundance was erroneous .",
    "they took @xmath36 , i.e. assumed massive neutrinos to be dirac particles with fully populated right - handed ( rh ) states ( although they acknowledged that according to the @xmath37 theory such states are non - interacting and would thus not be in equilibrium at @xmath38 ) .",
    "moreover they did not allow for the decrease in the neutrino temperature relative to photons due to @xmath22 annihilation .",
    "nevertheless their bound was competitive with the best laboratory bound on @xmath39 and @xmath40 times better than that on @xmath41 demonstrating the sensitivity ( if not the precision ! ) of cosmological arguments .",
    "a better bound of @xmath42  ev was quoted by marx and szalay @xcite who numerically integrated the cosmological friedmann equation from @xmath19 decoupling down to the present epoch , subject to the condition @xmath43 .",

    "as shapiro @xcite first emphasized , even if massive neutrinos are dirac rather than majorana , the rh states have no gauge interactions so should have decoupled much earlier than the left - handed ones .",
    "thus subsequent entropy generation by massive particle annihilations would have diluted their relic abundance to a negligible level . )",

    "measurements of the global space - time geometry using type i sn as ` standard candles ' are also consistent with a critical density universe @xcite , although local dynamical measurements indicate a smaller value of @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this has led some cosmologists to consider an open universe while others introduce a cosmological constant ( @xmath69 ) to maintain a flat geometry , notwithstanding the extreme fine - tuning of initial conditions implied in either case . )",
    "the above bound assumes conservatively that neutrinos constitute _ all _ of the ( dark ) matter permitted by the global dynamics of the universe .",
    "further constraints must be satisfied if they are to cluster on a specified scale ( e.g. galactic halos or galaxy clusters ) and provide the dark matter whose presence is inferred from dynamical measurements .",
    "cowsik and mcclleland @xcite first suggested that neutrinos with a mass of a few ev could naturally be the ` missing mass ' in clusters of galaxies .",
    "this follows from the relation @xmath70 ( reflecting the pauli principle ) which they obtained by modeling a cluster of mass @xmath71 as a square potential well of core radius @xmath72 filled with a fermi - dirac gas of neutrinos at zero temperature .",
    "subsequently tremaine and gunn @xcite noted that this provides a _ lower _ bound on the neutrino mass . although the microscopic phase - space density ( [ fnu ] ) is conserved for collisionless particles , the ` coarse - grained ' phase - space density in bound objects can decrease below its maximum value of @xmath73 during structure formation .",
    "modeling the bound system as an isothermal sphere with velocity dispersion @xmath74 and core radius @xmath75 then gives @xmath76 this is consistent with the cosmological upper bound ( [ mnu ] ) down to the scale of galaxies .",
    "moreover since neutrinos would cluster more efficiently in larger potential wells , there should be a trend of increasing mass - to - light ratio with scale , as seemed observationally to be the case @xcite .",
    "such cosmological arguments became of particular interest in the eighties after the itep tritium @xmath29-decay experiment claimed a @xmath77  ev mass for the electron neutrino .",
    "the attention of cosmologists now focussed on how the large - scale structure ( lss ) of galaxies , clusters and superclusters @xcite would have formed if the universe is dominated by massive neutrinos .",
    "the basic picture is that structure grows through gravitational instability from primordial density perturbations @xcite ; these perturbations have now been detected @xcite ( see figure  1 ) via the temperature fluctuations they induce @xcite in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "on large scales ( @xmath78 ) the universe approaches spatial homogeneity and gravitational dynamics is linear , while on smaller scales structure formation is complicated by non - linear gravitational clustering as well as non - gravitational ( gas dynamic ) processes .",
    "so although we lack a standard model of galaxy formation @xcite , the physics of _ large_-scale structure is sufficiently well understood as to provide a reliable probe of the nature of the dark matter @xcite .",
    "[ cobe4yr ]    density perturbations in a medium composed of relativistic collisionless particles are subject to a form of landau damping ( viz .",
    "phase - mixing through free streaming of particles from high to low density regions ) which effectively erases perturbations on scales smaller than the free - streaming length @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "this is essentially the ( comoving ) distance traversed by a neutrino from the big bang until it becomes non - relativistic , and corresponds to the scale of superclusters of galaxies .",
    "thus huge neutrino condensations ( generically in the shape of ` pancakes ' ) , containing a mass @xmath80 , would have begun growing at a redshift @xmath81 when the universe becomes matter - dominated and gravitational instability sets in .",
    "this is well before ( re)combination ( at @xmath82 ) so the baryons were still closely coupled to the photons , while the neutrinos were mildly relativistic ( @xmath83 ) hence ` hot ' .",
    "after the universe became neutral , baryonic matter would have accreted into these potential wells , forming a thin layer of gas in the central plane of the pancakes .",
    "thus superclusters would be the first objects to condense out of the hubble flow in a ` hot dark matter ' ( hdm ) cosmogony and smaller structures such as galaxies would form later through their fragmentation .",
    "the gross features of such a ` top - down ' model for structure formation are compatible with several observed features of lss , in particular the distinctive ` voids ' and ` filaments ' seen in large galaxy surveys .",
    "it was also noted that since primordial density perturbations can begin growing earlier than in an purely baryonic universe , their initial amplitude must have been smaller , consistent with extant limits on the isotropy of the microwave background .",
    "detailed studies @xcite found however that galaxies form late through the breakup of the pancakes , at a redshift @xmath84 , counter to observations of galaxies , in particular quasars at @xmath85 .",
    "( another way of saying this is that galaxies should have formed _",
    "last _ in an hdm universe , whereas our galaxy is in fact dynamically much older than the local group @xcite . )",
    "there are other difficulties such as too large ` peculiar ' ( non - hubble ) velocities @xcite , excessive x - ray emission from baryons which accrete onto neutrino clusters @xcite , and too large voids @xcite ( although detailed simulations @xcite showed later that some of these problems had been exaggerated ) .",
    "therefore cosmologists soon abandoned hdm and turned , with considerably more success , to cold dark matter ( cdm ) @xcite , i.e. particles which were non - relativistic at the epoch of matter - domination .",
    "detailed studies of cdm universes gave excellent agreement with observations of galaxy clustering @xcite and even led to progress in the understanding of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "thus a ` standard cdm model ' for large - scale structure formation was established , viz . a critical density cdm dominated universe with an initially scale - invariant spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "moreover particle physicists provided plausible candidate particles , notably the neutralino in supersymmetric models with conserved @xmath86-parity which naturally has a relic abundance of order the critical density @xcite .",
    "although the underlying physics is well known , cosmological structure formation is a complex subject and some implicit assumptions must necessarily be made in order to make progress .",
    "the key one concerns the nature of the primordial density perturbations .",
    "cosmologists usually assume these to have a power spectrum of the scale - invariant ` harrison - zeldovich ' form : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the fourier transform of spatial fluctuations in the density field ( of wavelength @xmath89 ) .",
    "moreover the perturbations are assumed to be gaussian ( i.e. different phases in the plane - wave expansion are uncorrelated ) and to be ` adiabatic ' ( i.e. matter and radiation fluctuate together ) . concurrent with the above studies concerning the nature of the dark matter , powerful support for this conjecture came from the development of the ` inflationary universe ' model @xcite . here",
    "the perturbations arise from quantum fluctuations of a scalar field @xmath90 , the vacuum energy of which drives a period of accelerated expansion in the early universe .",
    "the corresponding classical density perturbations have a spectrum determined by the ` inflaton ' potential @xmath91 , with a power - law index @xcite : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the normalized plank mass and @xmath94 denotes that this is to be evaluated when a mode of wavenumber @xmath95 crosses the ` hubble radius ' @xmath96 .",
    "thus we see that for a sufficiently ` flat potential ' ( as is necessary to achieve sufficient e - folds of inflation to solve the problems of the standard cosmology ) , the spectrum indeed has @xmath97 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , gravitational instability only sets in when the universe becomes matter - dominated and this modifies the spectrum on length scales smaller than the hubble radius at this epoch , viz . for @xmath98 .",
    "thus the characteristics of the dark matter can be encoded into a ` transfer function ' @xmath99 which modulates the primordial spectrum ; for hdm this is an exponentially dropping function while for cdm it is a more gradual power - law .",
    "now the power spectrum inferred from observations may be compared with theoretical models but another problem arises concerning how we are to normalize the amplitude of the primordial density perturbations , but we have as yet no definitive model of inflation . ] particularly since these are in the dark matter and may differ significantly ( i.e. be ` biased ' ) from the observable fluctuations in the density of visible galaxies . fortunately , the primordial perturbations have another unique observational signature .",
    "as mentioned earlier , they induce temperature fluctuations in the cmb through the ` sachs - wolfe effect ' ( gravitational red / blue shifts ) on large angular scales ( @xmath100 ) , corresponding to spatial scales larger than the hubble radius on the last scattering surface .",
    "it was the cobe detection @xcite of such fluctuations in 1992 that began the modern era of cosmological structure formation studies .",
    "[ wss_lss ]    the quadrupole anisotropy in the cmb measured by cobe @xcite allows a determination of the fluctuation amplitude at the scale , @xmath101 , corresponding roughly to the present ` size ' of the universe . with this normalization",
    "it became clear that a @xmath102 hdm universe indeed had too little power on small - scales for adequate galaxy formation .",
    "however it also became apparent ( see figure  2 ) that the ` standard cdm model ' when normalized to cobe had too _ much _ power on small - scales !",
    "it was thus a logical step to invoke a suitable mixture of cdm and hdm to match the power spectrum to the data on galaxy clustering and motions @xcite .",
    "[ shafi_fig1 ]    in fact the possibility that the dark matter may have both a hot and a cold component had been discussed several years earlier , motivated by theoretical considerations of susy guts , and the consequent advantages for large - scale structure noted @xcite . in the post - cobe era , a number of detailed studies of mixed dark matter ( mdm or chdm ) universes have been performed and a neutrino fraction of about @xmath103 found to give the best match with observations @xcite . in figure",
    "3 we show a fit to observational data for a mdm model which also incorporates a ( globally ) supersymmetric mechanism for inflation @xcite .",
    "the implied neutrino mass is about @xmath104 and the expectation ( in the ` see - saw ' model for neutrino masses ) is that this is the @xmath105 .",
    "therefore chorus / nomad will provide a test of this possibility ( assuming that the ckm mixing with the lighter neutrinos is of the same order as in the quark sector ) .",
    "more baroque schemes in which two neutrinos have comparable masses may be constructed ( e.g. @xmath106 ) if one wishes to reconcile the lsnd report of neutrino oscillations with the indications of atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite . in this case , both karmen and the forthcoming long - baseline experiments will provide crucial tests .    however",
    "another way to reconcile a cdm universe with the small - scale observations is to relax the underlying assumption that the primordial spectrum is strictly scale - invariant . as shown in figure  2 ,",
    "a mildly ` tilted ' spectrum with index @xmath107 also gives a good fit to the data @xcite . at first sight",
    "this might strike one as simply introducing an additional parameter ( although this is arguably no worse than introducing an additional form of dark matter ) .",
    "however one should really ask why the spectrum should be assumed to be _ exactly _ scale - invariant in the first place !    [ tcdm_lss ]    as we saw earlier , the spectral index is determined by the slope and curvature of the scalar potential at the epoch when the fluctuation on a specified scale crosses the hubble radius .",
    "the corresponding number of e - folds before the end of inflation is just @xmath108 ( for typical choices of the inflationary scale , reheat temperature etc ) .",
    "we see that fluctuations on the scales probed by lss and cmb observations ( @xmath109 ) are generated just @xmath110 e - folds before the end of inflation",
    ". it would be not unnatural to expect the inflaton potential to begin curving significantly as the end of inflation is approached ( e.g. in ` new inflation ' models ) .",
    "there are certainly attractive models of inflation in which the spectrum is significantly tilted in this region @xcite . in a successful inflationary model based on @xmath111 supergravity @xcite , the spectral index",
    "is simply given by @xmath112 so is naturally @xmath113 at these scales . in figure  4",
    "we compare the power spectrum for such a tilted spectrum in a cdm universe ( tcdm ) with data from the apm galaxy survey .",
    "it is seen that even the effects of non - linear evolution ( which generate a ` shoulder ' in the power spectrum ) at small scales can be successfully reproduced .",
    "indeed even mdm models @xcite now allow for the possibility that the primordial spectrum may be tilted in order to achieve better fits to the data .",
    "figure  5 indicates schematically how the hdm fraction required decreases as the tilt is increased @xcite .",
    "there are certainly differences in detail between mdm and tcdm models and new observational constraints , e.g. the epoch of quasar formation or the abundance of primordial lyman-@xmath114 clouds , may serve to distinguish between them @xcite .",
    "however a more powerful and unambiguous discriminator is provided by the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropy .",
    "[ omeganu - nk ]    in general a skymap of the cmb temperature can be decomposed into spherical harmonics @xmath115 where the @xmath116 multipole corresponds to an angle @xmath117 and probes spatial scales around @xmath118 . in inflationary theories ,",
    "the fluctuations are gaussian so the co - efficients @xmath119 are independent stochastic variables with zero mean and variance @xmath120 ; each @xmath121 has a @xmath122 distribution with @xmath123 degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "for an assumed set of cosmological parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath25 , @xmath124 ) and given the primordial density perturbation spectrum , the @xmath125 s can be determined by solution of the einstein - boltzmann equations which describe how the different components ( photons , ions , electrons , dark matter particles  ) evolve @xcite .",
    "thus theoretical estimates of the power @xmath126 at each multipole can be compared with observations .",
    "the low multipoles ( large spatial scales ) are sensitive to the primordial spectrum alone , but the cobe measurement ( of the first @xmath12720 multipoles ) finds @xmath128 @xcite so can not discriminate between a scale - invariant and a mildly tilted spectrum .",
    "however forthcoming measurements with angular resolution far superior to cobe s @xmath129 will measure the power at higher multipoles .",
    "the dominant features in the power spectrum here are the ` acoustic peaks ' , the most prominent at @xmath130 , arising from oscillations of the coupled plasma - photon fluids at last scattering @xcite .",
    "[ mdm_cl ]    as seen in figure  6 , the expectations for cmb anisotropy in a mdm universe do not differ significantly from a cdm universe having the same initial perturbation spectrum .",
    "however if the primordial spectrum is tilted , there is a significant suppression of the acoustic peaks at high multipoles ( see figure  7 ) . whereas present observations of small - angle anisotropy have a large scatter @xcite , forthcoming measurements , in particular by the map @xcite and planck @xcite satellite missions , will enable a definitive test .",
    "these observations will also determine all the cosmological parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath25 , @xmath124 ) to an accuracy of a few percent @xcite , opening up a new era in cosmology .",
    "the cosmological bound ( [ mnu ] ) is respected by the electron neutrino for which the particle data group @xcite now quotes @xmath131 .",
    "kinematic bounds on the masses of the other neutrinos are much weaker ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) so in principle they may have masses in the cosmologically forbidden range .",
    "[ tcdm_cl ]    there have been various suggestions ( many motivated by the now - withdrawn @xmath134 neutrino discovery ) that neutrinos may have new interactions which enable them to decay or annihilate sufficiently rapidly such that their relic abundance is reduced below the cosmological limit . in general this can be ruled out if the decays ( or annihilations ) create ` visible ' standard model particles , e.g. @xmath135 , @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "these processes have not been seen in laboratory experiments @xcite ( which probe short lifetimes ) , and would have affected cosmological observables such as light element abundances @xcite or the radiation backgrounds @xcite ( which are sensitive to long lifetimes ) . the only possibility is to have such decays ( or annihilations ) create hypothetical ` invisible ' particles , e.g. majorons ( goldstone bosons associated with lepton number violation ) @xcite .",
    "these are fertile grounds for speculation , as there are often no experimental constraints ( by construction ! ) on such hypotheses .",
    "many such proposals which _ can _ be experimentally tested have already been falsified .",
    "for example , if tau neutrinos have a large magnetic moment ( @xmath137 ) their self - annihilations are sufficiently boosted through @xmath138 exchange that @xmath105 s with mass of @xmath139 may constitute the dark matter @xcite .",
    "however this was ruled out from the absence of anomalous @xmath105 interactions in the bebc beam dump experiment @xcite .",
    "another suggestion was that flavour - changing neutral currents may allow the decay @xmath140 to be sufficiently fast @xcite .",
    "however the resultant breaking of the gim mechanism implies that the branching fraction of @xmath135 is smaller only by a factor of @xmath141 and this is observationally ruled out @xcite .",
    "majoron models for neutrino mass in which neutrinos may annihilate sufficiently rapidly through higgs exchange are ruled out by the lep measurement of the ` invisible ' width of the @xmath142 ; only rather contrived singlet - majoron models survive and even these are severely constrained by the non - observation of spectral features due to majoron emission in neutrinoless @xmath143 decay @xcite .",
    "so although exotic decays of e.g. the @xmath105 into singlet majorons , can not be definitively excluded , it seems unlikely that it can thus evade the cosmological bound and have a mass in the mev range .",
    "[ reion_cl ]    for a neutrino mass subject to the cosmological bound ( [ mnu ] ) , limits on the uv radiation background require the lifetime for @xmath135 to be far longer than the age of the universe .",
    "apart from large - scale structure this is another cosmological context where there may be an observational signal for hot dark matter .",
    "sciama @xcite has argued that much of the ionized hydrogen in both our galaxy and in the intergalactic medium can not be accounted for in terms of conventional sources of uv photons ( of energy @xmath144 ) , e.g. hot stars , supernovae or quasars .",
    "he proposes that all such observations may be consistently understood if the universe has @xmath102 in neutrinos of mass @xmath145 decaying radiatively with a lifetime of @xmath146 .",

    "as seen in figure  8 , the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum are thus severely damped @xcite , a prediction that is already being tested by ongoing experiments .",
    "hoyle and taylor @xcite as well as peebles @xcite had emphasized many years ago that new types of neutrinos ( beyond the @xmath20 and @xmath19 then known ) would boost the relativistic energy density hence the expansion rate ( [ h ] ) during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , thus increasing the yield of @xmath148 .",
    "shvartsman @xcite noted that new superweakly interacting particles would have a similar effect .",
    "subsequently this argument was refined quantitatively by steigman , schramm and collaborators @xcite . in the pre - lep era",

    "<S> considerations of the formation of large scale structure in the universe provide a sensitive , albeit indirect , probe of this possibility . </S>",
    "<S> observations of galaxy clustering and large angle anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background have been interpreted as requiring that neutrinos provide @xmath0 of the critical density . </S>",
    "<S> however the need for such ` hot ' dark matter is removed if the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations is tilted below scale - invariance , as is often the case in physically realistic inflationary models </S>",
    "<S> . this question will be resolved by forthcoming precision measurements of microwave background anisotropy on small angular scales . </S>",
