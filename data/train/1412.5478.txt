    "<S> the monte carlo results in lattice qcd for the pressure and energy density at small temperature @xmath0  mev and zero baryonic chemical potential are analyzed within the hadron resonance gas model . </S>",
    "<S> two extensions of the ideal hadron resonance gas are considered : the excluded volume model which describes a repulsion of hadrons at short distances and hagedorn model with the exponential mass spectrum . considering both of these models _ </S>",
    "<S> one by one _ we do not find the conclusive evidences in favor of _ any of them_. the controversial results appear because of rather different sensitivities of the pressure and energy density to both excluded volume and hagedorn mass spectrum effects . on the other hand , we have found a clear evidence for a _ simultaneous _ presence of _ both of them_. they lead to rather essential contributions : suppression effects for thermodynamical functions of the hadron resonance gas due to the excluded volume effects and enhancement due to the hagedorn mass spectrum . </S>"
