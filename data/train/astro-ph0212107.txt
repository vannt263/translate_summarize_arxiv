    "a primary goal of current cosmological studies is to determine whether the expansion of the universe is accelerating or decelerating at the present epoch , and what the acceleration or deceleration rate is . from this , we can determine the global cosmological parameters , and study how structure evolved .",
    "one way to improve our understanding of the recent history of the universe , and begin to quantify the properties of the  dark energy , \" is to observationally determine the redshift at which the universe transitions from acceleration to deceleration if is is established that the expansion of the universe is accelerating at the present epoch .",
    "`` dark energy '' is discussed , for example , by caldwell , dave , & steinhardt ( 1998 ) , turner & riess ( 2002 ) , frieman , huterer , linder , & turner ( 2002 ) , peebles & ratra ( 2002 ) , and peebles ( 2002 ) .    since astrophysics is a",
    " spectator science , \" for which we can only collect data but can not design and control experiments , unknown systematic errors are always a worry .",
    "the only way to convincingly establish a result is to have independent determinations that agree .",
    "the robertson - walker metric describes an expanding ( or contracting ) homogeneous and isotropic space - time , and has the line element    @xmath1    ( see , for example , weinberg 1972 ) , where the cosmic scale factor @xmath2 is related to the source redshift @xmath3 and the current value of the cosmic scale factor @xmath4 : @xmath5 . for light",
    "traveling from a source with redshift @xmath3 along a radial path , equation ( 1 ) implies that the coordinate distance to the source , @xmath6 can be obtained by integrating the equation @xmath7 in this universe , a source at redshift z , with intrinsic physical size d , and luminosity l , will have an observed angular size @xmath8 given by @xmath9 @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the  angular size distance \" @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the coordinate distance to the source .",
    "the flux @xmath14 that could be detected from the source is given by @xmath15 $ ] @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the  luminosity distance \" @xmath18 @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the dimensionless coordinate distance ( see , for example , peebles 1993 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath11 or @xmath17 to a source at redshift z can be observationally determined , then the coordinate distance @xmath13 and the dimensionless coordinate distance @xmath21 to that redshift are known .",
    "the coordinate distance is related to the cosmological parameters through the equations @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the coordinate distance is @xmath25 . for a universe with components for which the equations of state @xmath26 are time independent , such as a universe with quintessence ( caldwell , dave , & steinhardt 1998 ) @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for a component with non - evolving equation of state ( see , for example , the appendix of daly & guerra 2002 ) .",
    "the deceleration parameter at the present epoch is @xmath30 , when @xmath26 is time independent .",
    "thus , one way to determine the cosmological parameters @xmath31 and the equations of state @xmath26 , is to determine the coordinate distance to high - redshift sources , then use equations given above , and solve for the cosmological parameters that yield the observed coordinate distances . if the equation of state is time - dependent , or if a rolling scalar field such as that proposed by peebles & ratra ( 1988 ) is considered , then these equations must be modified accordingly as discussed , for example , by peebles & ratra ( 2002 ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters determined using this method then go into the equation for @xmath32 to determine whether the universe is accelerating or decelerating today .",
    "the equation for @xmath33 , which is very similar to that for @xmath32 , then allows a determination of the redshift at which the acceleration is expected to go through zero , which marks the redshift at which the universe transitions from acceleration to deceleration .",
    "a method of using the observed coordinate distances to go directly to the acceleration parameter as a function of redshift will be described below . and , a method of using the data directly to determine the function e(z ) without making any assumptions about the nature or redshift evolution of the dark energy will also be discussed .",
    "the beauty of using coordinate distance measurements to determine the cosmological parameters @xmath31 is that the true global cosmological parameters are determined ; no corrections need to be made for the clustering properties of matter , so that contributions to @xmath31 can not be missed or miscounted , and there are no biasing issues .",

    "the radio galaxy method relies on a comparison of the average size of an friib source determined by the mean size @xmath71 of the full population at that redshift [ @xmath72 , and the average source size , @xmath73 , determined using a physical model that describes the evolution of the source .",

    "however , this is not a good approximation for all of the sources in the radio galaxy sample .",
    "therefore , this approximation has not been adopted here , and the full equation @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 represent directly observed quantities , has been used to solve for @xmath21 to each source .",

    "the assumption that @xmath81 is consistent with models of jet production via the electromagnetic extraction of the spin energy from a rotating black hole .",
    "daly & guerra ( 2002 ) show that this relation results if the magnetic field strength in the vicinity of the rotating black hole is given by @xmath88 , or @xmath89 for @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the spin angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath94 is the gravitational radius of the black hole , and @xmath95 is the mass of the black hole ( see blandford 1990 ) .    the two other key assumptions of the radio galaxy model , that all friib classical doubles at a given redshift have a similar maximum or average size so that the average size of a given source will be close to that of full population at that redshift , and that strong shock physics applies near the forward region of the radio source , have been tested empirically , and are consistent with the data .",

    "these high - resolution observations will allow several tests of the rg model , and will be compared with detailed numerical simulations tailored to match the properties of these sources , which is being done in collaboration with joel calvalho and chris odea .",
    "these studies will be based on the numerical work of calvalho & odea ( 2002a , b ) , and will help to identify the physical processes that must be accounted for the in modeling friib sources .",
