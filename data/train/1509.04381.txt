    "solutions to boundary ( or initial ) value problems for various partial differential equations require knowledge of a boundary ( or initial ) function . however , often time , those functions are not fully known and only partial information about them can be measured , e.g. values at some finite set of points , average values over small measurement intervals , values of @xmath0 first consecutive fourier coefficients , etc .",
    "thus , it is very important to find an approximate solution based on available information on the boundary ( or initial ) function .",
    "furthermore , it is also natural and important to develop methods that provide an optimal ( in some sense ) approximation to the true solution .",
    "these research questions have been explored under the theory of optimal recovery of functions and operators , which is an area of approximation theory that started to develop in 1970s .",
    "more information on the development of the area can be found , for instance , in  @xcite .    as for specific applications to recovering solutions of boundary and initial value problems , magaril - illyaev , osipenko , and co - authors ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) have considered the problem of optimal @xmath1-approximation of the solution to the dirichlet problem for laplace s and possion s equations in simple domains ( disk , ball , annulus ) based on the first @xmath0 consecutive fourier coefficients of the boundary function ( possibly given with an error ) . in order to solve this problem",
    "they have used methods of harmonic analysis and general results from optimization theory .    in this paper",
    "we address related questions of optimal approximation of the solution to several types of integral equations , boundary and initial value problems for pde s .",
    "we begin by solving a more general problem of recovering a rather arbitrary integral operator and sum of operators .",
    "we then present the optimal _ method of recovery _ as well as the _",
    "optimal error_. next , we apply this general result to recover solutions to various boundary and initial value problems .",
    "moreover , we present optimal methods of recovery of the solution to boundary - value problems based on this incomplete information with error .",
    "naturally , the solution to the problem when information with error is used will also lead to the solution to the problem with exact information . in this paper",
    "we focus on considering the volterra s and fredholm s linear integral equations as well as boundary value problems for wave , heat , and poisson s equations .",
    "nevertheless , the developed method is more general and can be applied to other similar problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] contains necessary definitions and notation as well as the formulation and solution of the main problem . in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we solve the problem of optimal recovery of positive integral operators on classes of functions defined by moduli of continuity , based on information with an error about values of such functions at a fixed system of points . in section [ s4 ]",
    ", we use our general result from section [ s3 ] to address optimal recovery problems for the solutions of volterra and fredholm integral equations of the second kind , systems of linear first order differential equations with constant coefficients , poisson s equation , the heat and wave equations .",
