    "in 1926 there appeared nearly simultaneously two articles by schrdinger @xcite and pauli @xcite that solved one and the same central problem of the newly discovered quantum mechanics : the computation of the hydrogen atom spectrum . in most textbooks on quantum mechanics the eigenvalue problem is solved using schrdinger s approach with spherical coordinates and simultaneously diagonalizing the set of operators @xmath1 the main benefit of this approach is that one can deal , in principle , with any central potential and that the eigenstates have definite parity , which is of practical importance in the study of the selection rules for radiative transitions .",
    "however , a simple problem like the stark effect , is quite cumbersome to deal with perturbatively , except for the low lying states .",
    "an essential aspect of the coulomb problem is that the schrdinger equation is also separable in parabolic coordinates @xcite .",
    "this super - separability is related to the conservation of an additional vector @xmath2 the so - called runge - lenz ( rl ) vector , which is specific to the coulomb potential . despite its name",
    ", the discovery of this conserved vector in newtonian mechanics goes back to hermann in the 18th century , as noted by goldstein @xcite , who mentions also early works by laplace and hamilton .",
    "pauli succeeded in defining a quantum extension @xmath3 of the rl vector which is an observable , that is , an hermitian operator , and commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath4 this success enabled him to calculate the spectrum of the hydrogen atom by an abstract approach .",
    "the quantum extension of the rl vector was used to obtain the dynamical @xmath5 symmetry of the bound states .",
    "this symmetry , combined with the general theory of angular momentum allows to express the energies of the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "the main drawbacks of pauli s approach are that it works only for a coulomb potential and that the eigenstates have , in general , no definite parity . however , in the same article , pauli gave two non - trivial applications of his ideas : the first order perturbation of the energy levels under a uniform electric field ( stark effect ) and in the more complicated case of uniform electric and magnetic fields .",
    "guided by an analogous relation from classical mechanics , pauli guessed the following crucial relation between quantum expectation values : [ p ] 2h_0=32,where @xmath6 is the position operator and the expectation value should be taken in any eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath4 it is natural to call eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) pauli s identity and we will later discuss its origin .",
    "textbooks that discuss more advanced topics related to the quantum rl vector ( see refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) , do not treat these interesting applications .",
    "the main aim of this note is to popularize pauli s results . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the quantum rl vector and use it to derive the spectrum of the hydrogen atom @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii we present a new derivation of the crucial identity [ bb ] 2h_0=32 + 1i[h_0,],which implies eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that eq .",
    "( [ bb ] ) was first derived by a clever calculation of commutators by becker and bleuler @xcite fifty years after pauli s article .",
    "our derivation will make apparent that it is the natural quantum extension of a classical relation . in sec .",
    "iv we consider the hydrogen atom in the presence of uniform electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we then use pauli s elegant approach to obtain the first - order perturbed levels .",
    "we conclude with a short account of the experimental checks , some of which are quite recent .",
    "to set our notation ( we stick closely to those of @xcite ) , let us recall the basic properties of the quantum rl vector .",
    "as far as possible , we will use upper case letters for quantum operators .",
    "we will write the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom [ h ] h_0=-r , = , where @xmath7 is the reduced mass , @xmath8 is the proton charge and @xmath9 although going from the classical angular momentum @xmath10 to the operator @xmath11 is not ambiguous and leads to an hermitian operator @xmath12 the situation is somewhat more complicated for the rl vector .",
    "classically its definition [ rlcl ] = 1-shows that there are quantization ambiguities due to the lack of commutativity of the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 there are two possible ( but non - hermitian ) corresponding operators , @xmath15 and @xmath16 pauli observed that the simplest choice for @xmath17 so that it is hermitian is [ bm1 ] = 12 ( -)-.from these definitions we can check that both @xmath18 and @xmath17 are conserved at the quantum level , that is , that they commute with @xmath19    the classical poisson brackets involving @xmath20 and @xmath21 generalize to commutators of @xmath18 and @xmath17 : [ bm2 ] [ l_i , l_j]=i_ijkl_k , + [ l_i , m_j]=i_ijkm_k , + [ m_i , m_j]=()i_ijkl_k , two further important relations should be noted : [ bm3 ] = = 0 , + ^2=()(^2+^2)+^2 .",
    "the checks of the conservation of the rl vector and of eqs .",
    "( [ bm2 ] ) and ( [ bm3 ] ) are quite involved : a detailed calculation may be found in ref .",

    "@xcite ( p. 265 ) .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by the bound states @xmath22 with energy @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 can be defined by @xmath26 we also define [ mprime ] =(-)^1/2.because @xmath27 and @xmath28 commute with @xmath29 , the algebra in eq .",

    "for further use we define the generators [ bm5 ] = 12(+ ) , + = 12(-).their commutation rules are quite instructive : [ bm6 ] [ i_i , i_j]=i_ijki_k , + [ k_i , k_j]=i_ijkk_k , + [ i_i , k_j]=0,because they show that the operators @xmath31 generate an @xmath32 lie algebra , while the operators @xmath33 generate an @xmath34 lie algebra .",
    "furthermore these two algebras are completely independent ( commuting ) , and their casimir operators ( i. e. operators commuting with the whole algebra ) are @xmath35 for @xmath32 and @xmath36 for @xmath37    the correspondence given in ( [ bm5 ] ) between @xmath38 and @xmath39 gives just the change of basis that displays the isomorphism @xmath40 from the general theory of quantum angular momentum @xcite , we can find a basis common to the operators @xmath41 such that [ new1 ] \\",

    "note that the complete set of commuting observables diagonalized here are @xmath56 and @xmath57 while in schr \" odinger s approach one takes @xmath58 and @xmath59 note also that the angular momentum @xmath18 is axial , while @xmath17 is a true vector , so that @xmath60 have no definite parity , and hence their eigenstates can not have any definite parity .",
    "this absence of a definite parity is also obvious from the fact that the states @xmath48 have no definite value for the orbital angular momentum @xmath61 let us conclude that even for parity invariant potentials the eigenstates need not be of definite parity as can be seen in the discussion of the simpler case of a particle in a box , given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( p.328 ) .",
    "equation ( [ p ] ) has a classical content , because it involves mean values .",
    "indeed , for any classical periodic trajectory , the mean value of a dynamical quantity @xmath62 , is defined by [ cq1 ] f=1 t  _ 0^t  fdt= _ -^+",
    "f  r^2d , where @xmath63 is the period and @xmath64 is the angular momentum . for the coulomb case",
    ", we have [ cq2 ] = 1+e , + e= , + t=2,where @xmath65 @xmath66 is the total energy and @xmath67 the eccentricity of the orbit . we can show that the classical rl vector , lying in the trajectory plane , is directed from the origin to the perihelion , which lies on the @xmath68-axis .",

    "it follows that the difference between these two classical physical quantities must be a total derivative ( whose mean - value necessarily vanishes ) .",
    "so we need to find some vector @xmath71 such that [ cp2 ] 2h_0=32-ddt.since on dimensional grounds the sought vector has dimension of momentum @xmath72(length)@xmath73 , it must have the structure [ new3 ] = a()+b^2 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 , fixed by enforcing relation ( [ cp2 ] ) , give for @xmath71 the expression [ new4 ] = 12()-^2,which can be written more suggestively , using a poisson bracket as [ cp3 ] 2h_0=32+\\{h_0,},\\{f , g}=_s- .",
    "the above relations involve classical ( commuting ) quantities ; to generalize eq .",
    "( [ cp3 ] ) to the quantum level , we try the following quantum extension [ cp4 ] 2h_0=32 + 1i[h_0,],where the quantities involved are now operators and @xmath76 is the unknown quantum extension of the classical quantity @xmath77 we point out that in the left hand side of eq .",

    ", we have [ new8 ] ~32(2e_n^(0))^-1 = -(-2me_n^(0))^-1/2=- 32n,with @xmath87 it is then sufficient to use [ new9 ] =-,=+,to obtain [ pert1 ] h_1~(-32n+ ) + ( 32n+),with @xmath88 and @xmath89 notice that dimensional analysis shows that @xmath90 and @xmath91 have the same dimensions as energy .",
