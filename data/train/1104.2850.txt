    "the presence of a cusp in the centre of cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes is one of the strongest results of n - body simulations @xcite . however , the slope of this density profile is in apparent discrepancy with some observations of disk galaxies and galaxy clusters , which exhibit rather flat density cores @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite studied the bulge and the disk kinematics of the giant low surface brightness galaxy eso 323-g064 and showed that observations are not able to disentangle different density profiles , in that context .",
    "parallel to the alternative models for dark matter already proposed , there are also attempts to solve this discrepancy within the cdm cosmology using baryonic physics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the so - called core / cusp problem has been in the spotlight of astrophysical research for quite a while ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "one natural attempt to solve the apparent contradiction , is to study the gravitational effect of baryons in the dark matter density profile .",
    "this approach was first suggested by @xcite .",
    "the study of external impulsive mass loss events @xcite and steady winds @xcite corroborated with the idea that baryons have a crucial role in the determination of the density profile @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss how star formation processes can interfere in the central profile shape .",
    "@xcite argue that the existence of the central cusp is necessary in order to maintain the baryons trapped in the halo s gravitational potential . according to their results , the sum of sn explosions , tidal effects and star formation processes",
    "can completely destroy dwarf spheroidal haloes which initially present a core like central density .",
    "several authors suggested that the interstellar medium ( ism ) of dwarf galaxy systems could be entirely removed by supernovae ( sne ) explosions @xcite . in this work",
    ", we study the effect of a single sn explosion on the removal of baryon gas from the first haloes and the effects of this removal on the shape of the density profile .",
    "as stated in @xcite once removed , the cusp can not be reintroduced during subsequent mergers involved in hierarchical evolution of galaxies .",
    "this statement is supported by numerical and analytical results .",
    "outcomes from simulations made by @xcite imply that the universal characteristic shape of dark matter density profiles may be set early in the evolution of halos and @xcite shows theoretically that the remnant cusp can not be steeper than any of the progenitor cusps .",
    "in this work , we consider the possibility to solve the apparent core - cusp problem via baryonic physics @xcite .",
    "the sudden gas removal makes the dark matter distribution to expand .",
    "such mechanism can operate efficiently in small high redshift haloes , creating dark matter cores @xcite . using arguments similar to those presented by @xcite",
    ", we analyze this process in the context of distribution functions .",
    "it is initially assumed that baryons and dark matter are in an equilibrium configuration .",
    "considering that energy perturbations track the initial energy distribution ( dominated mainly by dark matter ) , after being perturbed , the halo will redistribute dark matter particles in a new equilibrium configuration . as a consequence ,",
    "variations in the initial halo distribution function , caused by energy or angular momentum perturbations , are followed by macroscopic quantities , such as the energy density profile .    in this paper , we considered the @xmath0cdm model with best fit parameters from @xcite ( wmap - yr7 ) , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sne ] , we briefly review our knowledge about the propagation of blastwaves in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and show the fraction of gas that can be removed from the haloes ; in section [ sec : fd ] , discuss the changes in density profile due to gas removal ; and in section [ sec : results ] , present and discuss our results .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss our conclusions .",
    "since the gravitational potential of the first collapsed haloes is shallow , the ionizing radiation from the first stars can expel the gas out of them @xcite . as a result",
    ", a subsequent sn can break away from the halo due to the decreased gas density by photoionization prior to the explosion @xcite . in order to understand the nature of the sn shock expanding into an essentially uniform and ionized intergalactic space ,",
    "we assume spherical symmetry .      as described in the review on astrophysical blastwaves by @xcite , and in the recent paper of @xcite , the evolution of a supernova remnant ( snr ) in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can be described as follows .",
    "initially , the energy is largely thermal , but as the supernova expands , the adiabatic expansion converts thermal into kinetic energy .    during the first stage ,",
    "the sn ejecta sweeps out roughly the same amount of mass as its own in the surrounding medium . in the second stage , the expansion of the shock front is well approximated by the sedov - taylor solution .",
    "eventually , radiative losses from the snr become significant , and the remnant enters in the third , radiative , stage of its evolution .",
    "a thin shell is formed just behind the shock front .",
    "finally the snr expands conserving momentum .",
    "@xcite found that supernova explosions with an energy @xmath3 ergs expel a significant portion of the initial baryonic mass from protogalaxies with total mass @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite performed numerical simulations of primordial supernovae in cosmological haloes from @xmath5 and showed that even less energetic explosions are capable of ejection of more than @xmath6 of the baryons from haloes containing @xmath7 .",
    "based on such studies , we assume that feedback from sn explosions are able to expel up to all the baryonic gas in primordial haloes .",
    "our next step then , is to evaluate what fraction of the total halo mass is in form of gas .      in order to evaluate the ratio of ejected gas mass to total ( virial ) halo mass",
    ", we used the expression obtained by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass fraction of the halo , @xmath10 is the filter mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the baryonic and dark matter energy density parameter , respectively and @xmath13 corresponds to the total ( virial ) mass of the halo . according to @xcite , @xmath14 at redshift @xmath15 , and the reionization epoch is assumed to occur between @xmath16 ( e.g. , the gas fraction of haloes with @xmath17 was @xmath18 at @xmath19 ) .",
    "since it is unlikely that the ejection of baryons was completely efficient , we consider cases where 5% , 10% and 15% of the total mass was expelled , which correspond to 31% , 61% and 92% of expulsion of the halo s baryonic mass , respectively .",
    "in order to understand the effect on the density profile , caused by the removal of baryonic matter from the halo , we study the evolution of its distribution function ( hereafter df ) .      the df fully describes the state of any collisionless system at any time , specifying the number of particles @xmath20 having positions in the small volume @xmath21 centered on @xmath22 and velocities in the small range @xmath23 centered on @xmath24 .",
    "the evolution of a collisionless system is governed by the boltzmann equation , @xmath25 .",
    "the df of a mass distribution in a steady state is related to its density profile through @xmath26    for an isotropic galaxy , the density can be written in the simple form @xmath27^{1/2}f(\\mathcal{e})\\,d\\mathcal{e}\\text { , }   \\label{eq : rho}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the relative potential and@xmath29 is the relative energy @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) is an abel integral whose solution is @xmath30      the usual parametrizations of cuspy density profiles ( eg . nfw ) lead to potentials without a simple analytical solution for the inverse function , @xmath31 . as a consequence , it is generally not possible to obtain an analytical form for the df from equation ( [ eq : fe ] ) .    in order to avoid these complications , we adopt the following family of spherical potentials @xcite , @xmath32 which leads to density profiles of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a characteristic density to be adjusted for each profile , or , in terms of the relative potential @xmath35.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this form of the density profile can conveniently capture the behavior of cusp and cored density profiles , for specific choices of the parameters @xmath36 .      the most common choice for the form of the density profile of haloes , which is also in best agreement with dm n - body simulations , is the nfw density profile @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are determined by the concentration parameter @xmath40 through @xmath41 where @xmath42 , is the average density of a virialized halo , and @xmath43 corresponds to its radius .",
    "since we are treating very high redshift ( @xmath44 ) haloes ( i.e. in the beginning of their mass accretion histories ) , we use @xmath45 , following the prescription of @xcite .    a different choice of @xmath40 should not , however , affect significantly the forthcoming results , since all of them can be expressed in function of the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath38 and will , thus , scale with a change in the concentration .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nfwadj ] we show that the density profile of equation ( [ eq : boaforma ] ) provides a very good approximation to the nfw profile for the choice @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with the difference between the two profiles never exceeding 10% .     at @xmath15 , and the ( blue ) points correspond to the general profile with @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the lower panel",

    "the fractional difference between the two profiles is shown.,title=\"fig : \" ]   at @xmath15 , and the ( blue ) points correspond to the general profile with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the lower panel",
    "the fractional difference between the two profiles is shown.,title=\"fig : \" ]    another common choice for a cored density profile , is the pseudo - isothermal ( pi ) profile @xmath61      the boltzmann equation of a collisionless isotropic system is @xmath62    the removal of the baryons from the halo will lead to a small change in its energy , @xmath63 .",
    "this change will take a small amount of time , @xmath64 , and will cause a change in the df .",
    "we will assume that the distribution function , after the perturbation , @xmath65 , will have the form @xmath66    to demonstrate the validity of the above assumption , we first expand the last equation keeping only first order terms in @xmath67 , @xmath68    if the ejection took place on a small time interval , @xmath64 , the transformation in the distribution function can be written as @xmath69 which , in the limit of small time intervals , is precisely the boltzmann equation .",
    "the formalism discussed in section [ sec : formalism ] allows us to understand how the removal from the halo , of a certain amount of relative energy , @xmath70 , change the density profile .",
    "it is , however , necessary to relate this change of energy with the actual expulsion of baryons by sne .    from a fundamental point of view",
    ", this correspondence is far from trivial since the same amount of energy could be removed by either lower mass , faster particles or higher mass , slower particles .",
    "there is , also , a cosmological context , where taking into account the mass outside the virial radius is not a sensible choice .",
    "we avoid those complexities taking the final density profile calculated for a given @xmath70 and , then , calculating the virial mass by a simple  and fast convergent  iterative procedure .",
    "we initialize the virial radius variable , @xmath71 , with the virial radius of the unperturbed halo .",
    "we then calculate the virial mass using @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the perturbed density profile .",
    "we reevaluate the virial radius @xmath74 and proceed to the next iteration .",
    "this procedure converges rapidly to a consistent value for the virial mass of a perturbed halo , which can be compared with the known virial mass of the unperturbed halo ( set to @xmath75 in our calculations ) , therefore allowing us to relate variations in energy with variations in mass .",
    "using the formalism developed in the end of section [ sec : fd ] , we calculated the df associated with nfw density profile ( the particular expression for the df can be found in appendix [ sec : calculateddf ] ) .",
    "the df found were then perturbed through equation ( [ eq : removee ] ) and a transformed density profile was generated from it using equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) .        in figure",
    "[ fig : densitynfw ] we see how a nfw density profile varies due to the expulsion of 5% , 10% and 15% of mass of the halo ( namely , removal of 0.57% , 1.17% and 1.81% of the relative energy , respectively ) .",
    "the appearance of a core in the transformed density profile is noticeable .    in order to get better quantitative insight",
    ", we fit a pseudo - isothermal density profile to the resultant transformed profile .",
    "we found a core radii of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the removal of 5% , 10% and 15% of the the halo s mass , respectively .",
    "we also fit a burkert - like profile finding @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 for 5% , 10% and 15% of removal of the halo s mass .    as in the nfw case",
    ", we fit a pseudo - isothermal density profile to the resultant transformed profile .",

    "the fit of a burkert - like profiles leads to @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 for 5% , 10% and 15% of removal of the the halo s mass .",
    "our core radius are approximately similar to the one found by @xcite . in their analysis",
    ", they @xmath88 lies in the range @xmath89 , depending of the model for outflow .    as the sn could also occur in a halo which was originally cored ( e.g. haloes where the core was previously erased by the process exposed )",
    ", we performed the same analysis for a halo with an initial core profile . in figure",
    "[ fig : densitybur ] we show the evolution of a burkert density profile after energy removal .",
    "as we can see , the core structure is maintained after gas removal and its radius remains approximately unchanged .",
    "we explored the effect of a supernova explosion on the central density of a small mass ( @xmath90 ) dark matter halo at high redshifts .",
    "we first reviewed ( section [ sec : sne ] ) the evidence that supernovae can efficiently expel a large part of the baryonic mass from small haloes .",
    "we then built a simple analytical model where we assume that    1 .",
    "the halo is approximately isotropic , 2 .",
    "the mass expelled by the sn leads to a small loss of energy of the halo .    since typical parametrizations of the density profile",
    "do not lead to invertible expressions for the potentials , we used the profile of equation ( [ eq : boaforma ] ) , which is shown to be consistent with both cusp and cored density distributions .    from the density profile we calculated the distribution function associated with nfw profile .",
    "we , then , evolved this distribution function , removing a small amount of energy from it .",
    "the final density profile found does not present a cusp , but , instead , a core .",
