    "the potts models describe a special and easily defined class of statistical mechanics models . nevertheless , they are richly structured enough to illustrate almost every conceivable nuance of the subject .",
    "in particular , they are at the center of the most recent explosion of interest generated by the confluence of conformal field theory , percolation theory , knot theory , quantum groups and integrable systems .",
    "the potts model @xcite was introduced as a generalization of the ising model to more than two components . at present",
    "the potts model encompasses a number of problems in statistical physics ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "some exact results about certain properties of the model were known , but more of them are based on approximation methods .",
    "note that there does not exist analytical solutions on standard lattices .",
    "but investigations of phase transitions of spin models on hierarchical lattices showed that they make the exact calculation of various physical quantities @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "such studies on the hierarchical lattices begun with development of the migdal - kadanoff renormalization group method where the lattices emerged as approximants of the ordinary crystal ones . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of exactly solved models deserves some general interest in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "moreover , nowadays the investigations of statistical mechanics on non - amenable graphs is a modern growing topic ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , bethe lattices are most simple hierarchical lattices with _ non - amenable _ graph structure .",
    "this means that the ratio of the number of boundary sites to the number of interior sites of the bethe lattice tends to a nonzero constant in the thermodynamic limit of a large system , i.e. the ratio @xmath3 ( see for the definitions sec .",
    "2 ) tends to @xmath4 as @xmath5 , here @xmath6 is the order of the lattice .",
    "nevertheless , that the bethe lattice is not a realistic lattice , however , its amazing topology makes the exact calculation of various quantities possible @xcite .",
    "it is believed that several among its interesting thermal properties could persist for regular lattices , for which the exact calculation is far intractable . in @xcite",
    "the phase diagrams of the @xmath7-state potts models on the bethe lattices were studied and the pure phases of the the ferromagnetic potts model were found . in @xcite using those results , uncountable number of the pure phase of the 3-state potts model were constructed .",
    "these investigations were based on a measure - theoretic approach developed in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the bethe lattices were fruitfully used to have a deeper insight into the behavior of the potts models .",
    "the structure of the gibbs measures of the potts models has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "certain algebraic properties of the gibbs measures associated with the model have been considered in @xcite .",
    "it is known that the ising model with competing interactions was originally considered by elliot @xcite in order to describe modulated structures in rare - earth systems . in @xcite",
    "the interest to the model was renewed and studied by means of an iteration procedure .",
    "the ising type models on the bethe lattices with competing interactions appeared in a pioneering work vannimenus @xcite , in which the physical motivations for the urgency of the study such models were presented .",
    "in @xcite the infinite - coordination limit of the model introduced by vannimenus was considered .",
    "it was also found a phase diagram which was similar to that model studied in @xcite . in @xcite,@xcite other generalizations of the model",
    "were studied . in all of those works",
    "the phase diagrams of such models were found numerically , so there were not exact solutions of the phase transition problem . note that the ordinary ising model on bethe lattices was investigated in @xcite , where such model was rigourously investigated . in @xcite,@xcite the ising model with competing interactions has been rigourously studied , namely for this model a phase transition problem was exactly solved and a critical curve was found as well .",
    "for such a model it was shown that a phase transition occurs for the medium temperature values , which essentially differs from the well - known results for the ordinary ising model , in which a phase transition occurs at low temperature . moreover ,",
    "the structure of the set of periodic gibbs measures was described . while studying such models",
    "the appearance of nontrivial magnetic orderings were discovered .",
    "since the ising model corresponds to the two - state potts model , therefore it is naturally to consider @xmath7-state potts model with competing interactions on the bethe lattices .",
    "note that such kind of models were studied in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite on standard @xmath8 and other lattices . in the present paper we are going to study a phase transition problem for the three - state ferromagnetic potts model with competing interactions on a bethe lattice of order two . in this paper",
    "we will use a measure - theoretic approach developed in @xcite , which enables us to solve exactly such a model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give some preliminary definitions of the model with competing ternary ( with couplings @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and binary interactions on a bethe lattice . in section 3",
    "we derive recurrent equations for the partition functions . to show how the derived recurrent equations are related with the surface energy of the hamiltonian",
    ", we give a construction of a special class of limiting gibbs measures for the model at @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the problem of describing the limit gibbs measures is reduced to a problem of solving a nonlinear functional equation . in section 4 the set of ground states of the model is completely described .",
    "using this fact and the recurrent equations , in section 5 , one finds gibbs measures ( pure phases ) associated with the translation - invariant ground states .",
    "a curve of the critical temperature is exactly found , under one there occurs a phase transition . in section 6",
    ", we prove the existence of the free energy .",
    "the free energy of the translations - invariant gibbs measures is also calculated .",
    "some physical quantities are computed as well .",
    "discussions of the results are given in the last section .",
    "recall that the bethe lattice @xmath9 of order @xmath10 is an infinite tree , i.e. , a graph without cycles , such that from each vertex of which issues exactly @xmath11 edges . let @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the set of vertices of @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the set of edges of @xmath16 .",

    "is called a _ path _ from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "then the distance @xmath22 , on the bethe lattice , is the number of edges in the shortest path from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .    for a fixed @xmath23 we set @xmath24",
