    "quantum many - body systems with a single - particle flat band have attracted much attention .",
    "about twenty years ago mielke and tasaki @xcite showed that a repulsive on - site interaction in flat - band hubbard systems yields ferromagnetic ground states .",
    "more recently , a very active and still ongoing discussion of flat - band systems in the context of topological insulators has been started , see , e.g. ref .   and references therein .",
    "frustrated quantum antiferromagnets represent another active research field , where flat - band physics my lead to interesting low - temperature phenomena @xcite , such as a macroscopic jump in the ground - state magnetization curve and a nonzero residual ground - state entropy at the saturation field as well as an extra low - temperature peak in the specific heat .",
    "all these phenomena are related to the existence of a class of exact eigenstates in a form of localized multi - magnon states which become ground states in high magnetic fields .",
    "an interesting and typical example of such a flat - band system is the @xmath1 delta or sawtooth heisenberg model consisting of a linear chain of triangles as shown in fig .  1",
    ". the interaction @xmath2 acts between the apical ( even ) and the basal ( odd ) spins , while @xmath3 is the interaction between the neighbor basal sites .",
    "there is no direct exchange between apical spins .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 are @xmath1 operators and @xmath6 is the dimensionless magnetic field",
    ".    the ground state of model ( [ q ] ) with both antiferromagnetic @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( af delta chain ) has been studied as a function of @xmath9 in refs .. at high magnetic fields for excitations above the fully polarized ferromagnetic state the lower one - magnon band is dispersionless for a special choice of the coupling constants @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the excitations in this band are localized states , i.e. the excitations are restricted to a finite region of the chain .",
    "these localized one - magnon states allow to construct a set of multi - magnon states .",
    "configurations , where the localized magnons spatially separated ( isolated ) from each other , become also exact eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ q ] ) . at the saturation field @xmath11 all these states have the lowest energy and the ground state is highly degenerated @xcite .",
    "the degree of the degeneracy can be calculated by taking into account a hard - core rule forbidding the overlap of localized magnons with each other ( hard - dimer rule ) .",
    "exact diagonalization studies@xcite indicate , that the ground states in this antiferromagnetic model are separated by finite gaps from the higher - energy states .",
    "thus the localized multi - magnon states can dominate the low - temperature thermodynamics in the vicinity of the saturation field and the thermodynamic properties can be calculated by mapping the af delta chain onto the hard - dimer problem @xcite . a similar structure of the ground states with localized magnons",
    "is realized in a variety of frustrated spin lattices in one , two and three dimensions such as the kagome , the checkerboard , the pyrochlore lattices , see e.g. refs ..    in contrast to the af delta chain , the model ( [ q ] ) with ferromagnetic @xmath12 and antiferromagnetic @xmath8 interactions ( f - af delta chain ) is less studied , though it is rather interesting . in particular , it is a minimal model for the description of the quasi - one - dimensional compound @xmath13[cu(bpy)(mal)h_{2}o](clo_{4})$ ] containing magnetic @xmath14 ions @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that the ground state of the f - af delta chain is ferromagnetic for @xmath15 . in ref .",
    "it was argued that the ground state for @xmath16 is a special ferrimagnetic state .",
    "the critical point @xmath17 is the transition point between these two ground state phases .    in this paper",
    "we will demonstrate that the behavior of the model at this point is highly non - trivial .",
    "similarly to the af delta chain also the f - af model at the critical point supports localized magnons which are exact eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "they are trapped in a valley between two neighboring triangles , where the occupation of neighboring valleys is forbidden ( the so - called non - overlapping or isolated localized - magnon states . )",
    "we will show that the ground states in the spin sector @xmath18 , @xmath19 , consist of states with @xmath20 isolated localized magnons ( @xmath20-magnon states ) , but in contrast to the af case they are exact ground states at zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "moreover , in addition to @xmath20-magnon configurations consisting of non - overlapping localized magnons there are states with overlapping ones .",
    "hence , the degree of degeneracy of the ground state is even larger than in the af delta chain .",
    "another difference to the localized - magnon states in the af delta chain concerns the gaps between the ground state and the excited states which become very small for @xmath21 .",
    "it means that the contribution of the ground states to the thermodynamics does not dominate even for low temperatures .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider the ground states of the f - af delta chain at the critical point .",
    "based on the localized - states scenario we calculate analytically the degree of the ground - state degeneracy and check our analytical predictions by comparing them with full exact diagonalization ( ed ) data for finite chains up to @xmath22 sites . in the section iii we study the low - temperature thermodynamics of the considered model .",
    "we will show that the low - lying states are separated from the ground states by very small gaps .",
    "these low - lying excitations give the dominant contribution to the thermodynamics as the temperature grows from zero and approaches these small gaps .",
    "we calculate different thermodynamic quantities , such as magnetization , susceptibility , entropy , and specific heat by full ed of finite chains and discuss the low - temperature behavior of these quantities . in section iv we consider the magnetocaloric effect in the critical f - af delta chain . in the concluding section",
    "we give a summary of our results .",
    "-chain model.,width=480 ]",
    "in this section we study the ground state of the f - af delta chain at the critical point . for this aim",
    "it is convenient to represent the hamiltonian ( [ q ] ) at @xmath23 as a sum of local hamiltonians @xmath24where @xmath25 is the hamiltonian of the @xmath26-th triangle , which can be written in a form @xmath27 in eq.([q2 ] ) we put @xmath28 .",
    "the three eigenvalues of eq.([q2 ] ) are @xmath29 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the states with spin quantum numbers @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath32 , correspondingly . because the local hamiltonians @xmath25 generally do not commute with each other , for the lowest eigenvalue @xmath33 of @xmath34 holds @xmath35 it is evident that the energy of the ferromagnetic state with maximal total spin @xmath36 of model ( [ q1 ] ) is zero .",
    "therefore , the inequality in eq.([q3 ] ) turns in an equality and the ground state energy of eq .",
    "( [ q1 ] ) is zero .",
    "the question is : how many states with different total spin have zero energy ?    at first , we consider one - magnon states with @xmath37 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath38 of these states for the f - af delta chain with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) has two branches .",
    "one of them is dispersionless with @xmath39 while the second branch is dispersive and its energy is @xmath40 the dispersionless one - magnon states correspond to localized states which can be chosen as @xmath41where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these functions are exact eigenfunctions of each local @xmath25 with zero energy .",
    "it can be checked directly that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , while for other @xmath46 the local hamiltonian @xmath25 and the operators @xmath47 defined by eq.([q4 ] ) commute giving @xmath48 . the @xmath49 states ( [ q4 ] ) form a complete nonorthogonal basis in the space of the dispersionless branch .",
    "it follows from the fact that the relation @xmath50is fulfilled if all @xmath51 , only . besides",
    ", we note that there are @xmath52 linear combinations of @xmath53 which belong to the states with @xmath37 and one combination belongs to @xmath54 .",
    "the latter is @xmath55    for the f - af delta chain with open boundary conditions ( obc ) and odd @xmath56 there are @xmath57 localized one - magnon states with zero energy and their wave functions are @xmath58 these functions are linearly independent similarly to those for the periodic delta chain .",
    "it is convenient to introduce another set of linearly independent operator functions instead of @xmath59 which have the form @xmath60 all functions @xmath61 are eigenfunctions with zero energy of each local hamiltonian @xmath25 .",
    "similarly to the periodic chain the @xmath52 functions @xmath61 with @xmath62 belong to @xmath37 and @xmath63 is the function of the state with @xmath54 and @xmath64 because @xmath65 .",
    "let us consider two - magnon states . for simplicity we will deal with the delta chain with obc .",
    "it is clear that the pair of isolated ( non - overlapping ) magnons is an exact ground state of the hamiltonian    ( [ q1 ] ) and the wave functions of pairs , @xmath66 @xmath67 are exact ground state functions of each local @xmath68 with zero energy .",
    "the number of such pairs is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the binomial coefficient .",
    "it can be proved similarly to the case of the af delta chain @xcite that these states are linearly independent .",
    "in fact , the exact two - magnon ground state wave functions of the hamiltonian ( [ q1 ] ) at @xmath23 can be chosen by many other ways .",
    "we determine the set of two - magnon states as following @xmath71 though eq .",
    "( [ q6 ] ) contains products of interpenetrating operator functions @xmath59",
    "( i.e.  acting on commonly involved sites ) , it is easy to be convinced that the states defined in eq .",
    "( [ q6 ] ) are exact ground state wave functions of each @xmath68 .",
    "for example , let us consider the function @xmath72 .",
    "it equals @xmath73where @xmath74 is the lowering spin operator of the first triangle .",
    "then , this function is an exact ground state function of @xmath75 , because @xmath76 creates a mixture of the states with @xmath31 and @xmath32 of @xmath75 with zero energy . on the other hand ,",
    "this function is an exact ground state function of @xmath77 , because it contains the combination @xmath78 in the first bracket .",
    "it is also clear that the function ( [ q7 ] ) is an exact ground state function of @xmath25 with @xmath79 because @xmath25 for these @xmath26 commute with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "a similar consideration can be extended to any function having the form ( [ q6 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath82 contains the lowering operators @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is the total lowering spin operator for the first @xmath20 triangles ) . the construction of the brackets in eq .",
    "( [ q6 ] ) ensures the relation @xmath86 for @xmath87 , while this relation for @xmath88 is fulfilled automatically .",
    "it easy to check that the set of functions ( [ q6 ] ) can be transformed to the set @xmath89 @xmath67 using the condition @xmath65 .    strictly speaking we should also show that the set of the states ( [ q6 ] ) after a projection onto the states with @xmath90 gives all linearly independent states in this spin sector .",
    "we checked this analytically for systems with @xmath91 ( i.e.  @xmath92 ) but we did not succeed with a rigorous proof of this statement .",
    "since the operator function @xmath93 with @xmath94 belongs to a state @xmath95 in the sector @xmath96 , it is not described by eq .",
    "( [ q6 ] ) by definition . the number of states described by eq .",
    "( [ q6 ] ) amounts @xmath69 .",
    "now we consider the general case of the @xmath20-magnon subspace with @xmath97 .",
    "it is evident that a state consisting of @xmath20 isolated localized magnons @xmath98is an exact ground state of eq .",
    "( [ q1 ] ) .",
    "the number of such states is @xmath99 and they are feasible if @xmath100 for obc .",
    "however , the set of states ( [ k0-set ] ) does not present the complete manifold of the ground states in the sectors of @xmath101 @xmath102 for @xmath103 . similarly to the two - magnon case we choose the @xmath20-magnon set in the form @xmath104 the functions ( [ k - set ] ) are exact ground state functions of the hamiltonian ( [ q1 ] ) .",
    "this can be proved by analogy with the two - magnon case .",
    "we assume again that after projection onto @xmath105 the set of states ( [ k - set ] ) will give a complete set of linearly independent wave functions in this sector . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ k - set ] ) the number of these functions is @xmath106 .",
    "again we have checked and confirmed this by full ed for finite delta chains .",
    "we note that the hypothesis about the number of degenerated ground states in the sector @xmath101 @xmath102 has been suggested in ref . as a guess based on numerical calculations . the number of functions in eq .",
    "( [ k - set ] ) is larger than the number of those given in eq .",
    "( [ k0-set ] ) . moreover , the functions of the type described by eq .",
    "( [ k - set ] ) are feasible for any @xmath20 . in particular , for @xmath107 there is a single ground state function with zero energy .",
    "in addition to eq.([k - set ] ) we can choose the sets of the ground state functions in the sectors @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "they have the forms @xmath110 this set of functions represents the ground state functions with @xmath111 but @xmath112 , @xmath113 , ... , @xmath114 .    the total number of ground states in the sector @xmath111 amounts @xmath115    let us now consider the delta chain with pbc .",
    "it is evident that the ground state in the sector @xmath108 can be formed by @xmath20 non - overlapping localized magnons @xmath116 the number of possibilities to place @xmath20 magnons on a delta chain without overlap is @xmath117 this is the number of degenerated ground states in the sector @xmath108 built by @xmath20 non - overlapping localized magnons .",
    "it corresponds to the one - dimensional classical hard - dimer problem.@xcite the maximum number of localized magnons for the closest possible packing is @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "remarkably , the non - overlapping localized - magnon states ( [ k periodic ] ) do not exhaust all possible ones for @xmath103 .",
    "there is another way of the ground state construction .",
    "for example , we can write the exact ground state for @xmath120 as @xmath121 carrying out computations similarly to those for the open chain it is easy to see that the function ( [ p2 ] ) is an exact eigenfunction with zero energy for the local hamiltonians @xmath25 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 and for the other ones . formula ( [ p2 ] ) can be extended for @xmath103 by adding corresponding brackets .",
    "on the base of the analysis of possible construction of such type we conjecture that the ground state degeneracy in the sector @xmath101 @xmath102 amounts @xmath124 according to eq .",
    "( [ an ] ) @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the third term in eq .",
    "( [ an ] ) corresponds to the special ground state for @xmath128 described by the famous resonating - valence - bond eigenfunction @xcite which is not of `` multi - magnon '' nature . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ an ] ) the number of the ground states for fixed @xmath108 is @xmath129 eqs.([an ] ) and ( [ number ] ) have been confirmed by ed calculations of finite chains up to @xmath22 .",
    "the total number of degenerate ground states is @xmath130 the value of the entropy per site is @xmath131 .",
    "that is the residual entropy per site at zero magnetic field which becomes for @xmath132 @xmath133 obviously , the residual entropy of the considered @xmath56-site interacting spin-@xmath134 system corresponds to the entropy of @xmath135 non - interacting @xmath136 spins .",
    "it is interesting to compare the residual entropy of the f - af delta chain at the critical point with that for the af delta chain at the saturation field . for the af delta chain",
    "it amounts @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "i.e.  @xmath138 is larger than @xmath139 due to the existence of the additional ground states which do not belong to the class of non - overlapping localized magnons .",
    "concluding this section we point out that the considered model is one more example of a quantum many - body system with a macroscopic ground - state degeneracy resulting therefore    in a residual entropy .",
    "the next interesting question is whether the degenerate ground states are separated by a finite gap from all other eigenstates .",
    "this question is important for thermodynamic properties of the model .",
    "if a finite gap exists in all spin sectors then the low - temperature thermodynamics is determined by the contribution of the degenerate ground states .",
    "such a situation takes place for the delta chain with antiferromagnetic interactions . as it will be demonstrated below it",
    "is not the case for the considered model .    as follows from eq.([one - magnon ] ) the gap @xmath140 in the one - magnon sector is @xmath141 ( in @xmath142 units ) .",
    "however , the minimal energy of two - magnon excitations dramatically decreases .",

    "the exact wave function of this state has the form @xmath145where @xmath146 .",
    "the energy of this state is @xmath147 .",
    "it could be expected that the low - lying excited two - magnon states are formed by scattering states of magnons from the dispersionless one - magnon branch",
    ". however , the wave function ( [ two - magnon gap ] ) has a more complicated specific form of a bound state .    the gaps for the @xmath20-magnon states with @xmath103 decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath20 as it can be seen from the table 1 , where the gaps in the sector @xmath148 for chains with @xmath149 are presented .",

    "the standard materials for magnetic cooling are paramagnetic salts . the geometrically frustrated quantum spin systems can be considered as alternative materials for low - temperature magnetic cooling . the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state at the saturation magnetic field in some of them , including the af delta chain , leads to an enhanced magnetocaloric effect in the vicinity of this field @xcite . however , the saturation field is relatively high in real materials and practical applications of such systems for magnetic cooling are rather questionable .",
    "in contrast , the f - af delta chain with @xmath23 has a finite zero - temperature entropy at zero magnetic field .",

    "( [ t0 ] ) for the special case @xmath256 the critical temperature @xmath257 and eqs.([th1 ] ) and ( [ dtdh1 ] ) are valid in the low temperature limit .    in the case",

    "one should be aware that the expected magnetocaloric effect is expected to be somewhat reduced due to deviations from the critical point considered here and always present residual interactions beyond those considered in eq .",
    "a quantitative and systematic study of these cases is postponed to subsequent studies .",
    "we have studied the ground state and the low - temperature thermodynamics of the delta chain with f and af interactions at the transition point between the ferromagnetic and the ferrimagnetic ground states .",
    "the most spectacular feature of this frustrated quantum many - body system is the existence of a macroscopically degenerate set of ground states leading to a large residual entropy per spin of @xmath0",
    ". remarkably , for these ground states explicit exact expressions can be found . among the exact ground states in the spin sector @xmath272",
    "there are states consisting of @xmath20 independent ( non - overlapping ) magnons each of which is localized between two neighboring apical sites .",
    "the same class of localized ground states exist for the sawtooth model ( [ q ] ) with both af interactions at the saturation field @xcite .",
    "however , such states do not exhaust all ground states in the considered model .",
    "in addition to them , there are exact ground states of another type consisting of products of overlapping localized magnons .",

    "we have checked our analytical predictions for the degeneracy of the ground states in the sectors @xmath105 by comparing them with numerical data for finite chains .",
    "the ground - state degeneracy grows exponentially with the system size @xmath56 and leads to above mentioned finite entropy per site at @xmath273 .",

    "the highly degenerate ground - state manifold as well as the low - lying excited states contribute substantially to the partition function , especially at small @xmath211 .",
    "that is confirmed by the comparison of the data for the magnetization @xmath154 and the susceptibility @xmath274 obtained by ed of finite chains with those given by the contribution of the only degenerate ground states",
    ". the subtle interplay of ground states and excited states leads to unconventional low - temperature properties of the model .",
    "we have shown that the magnetization @xmath154 at small @xmath6 and @xmath211 is a function of the universal variable @xmath275 with an index @xmath276 .",
    "this value of @xmath277 agrees with the critical index for the susceptibility .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed the behavior of @xmath278 for finite chains .",
    "we have found that this behavior can be described by one universal finite - size scaling function .",
    "the entropy and the specific heat have also been calculated by ed for finite chains .",
    "the entropy per site is finite at @xmath273 and increases approximately with a power - law dependence at @xmath172 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat has a rather interesting form characterized by a broad maximum at @xmath223 and two weak maxima at @xmath279 .",
    "similar as the model with both af interactions there is an enhanced magnetocaloric effect .",
    "while for af model this enhanced effect is observed when passing the saturation field , we find it for the considered model when the applied magnetic field is switched off , which is obviously more suitable for a possible application .    in conclusion , we note that the structure of the ground state formed by the localized magnons is realized not only in the critical point of the spin-@xmath134 f - af delta - chain but also in the @xmath280 chain , where @xmath281 and @xmath282 are the spins on the apical and the basal sites correspondingly . the critical point for this model",
