    "one of the most remarkable twists that the braneworld scenario has introduced in our view of physics is that the fundamental scale of gravity could be significantly closer to scales currently accessible by experiments than previously thought . in the braneworld paradigm ,",
    "the standard model of physics is localized to a four dimensional brane while gravity ( and possibly other fields ) propagate in the entire space , the bulk . in the 4-d perspective , this results in the rescaling of many couplings and mass scales present in the theory , thus providing an alternative approach to the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "naturally , an important problem in the study of this type of theories is understanding the possible ways in which the standard model can be localized to a brane @xcite ; different mechanisms to localize matter and gauge fields to a brane may have distinctive features with relevant implications for braneworld phenomenology .",
    "in addition , several aspects of the standard model s rich structure could be understood in terms of how physics is arranged in the bulk .",
    "a simple mechanism for the confinement of higher dimensional fermions to a domain wall was proposed long ago by rubakov and shaposhnikov @xcite and is based purely on field theoretical considerations . in their proposal , the wave functions of fermion zero modes concentrate near the existing domain walls , generating 4-d massless chiral fermions attached to them .",
    "this mechanism has given rise to interesting braneworld scenarios with clear consequences for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "one is the split fermion scenario , proposed by arkani - hamed and schmaltz @xcite . here ,",
    "bulk fermions are split into different positions around the brane , offering a simple solution to the hierarchy problem and the proton decay problem : the separation between chiral fermions along the extra dimension generates exponentially suppressed couplings between them ( for example , yukawa couplings ) @xcite .    in the case of gauge fields ,",
    "a mechanism for their localization ( closely related to the confinement of fermions ) is also available .",
    "this is the case of the quasilocalization of gauge fields , proposed by dvali , gabadadze and shifman @xcite ( see @xcite for alternatives ) . here",
    ", the interaction between bulk gauge fields and the `` already '' localized fermions induces gauge kinetic terms on the brane .",
    "the result is a 4-d effective theory consisting of gauge fields mediating interactions between the localized fermions",
    ". an interesting feature of this type of mechanism is the appearance of a crossover scale @xmath1 : at distances below this scale the propagation of gauge fields along the brane is manifestly four - dimensional , whereas above this scale the propagation becomes five - dimensional .",
    "in this paper we put together both types of confining mechanisms for fermions and gauge fields to reproduce the basic structure of the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "we show that the gauge symmetry exhibited by bulk fermions can be broken down through their confinement to a domain wall , giving rise to non - trivial subgroup representations .",
    "more precisely , by starting with a five - dimensional @xmath0 gauge theory in the bulk , we obtain an @xmath2 chiral theory on the brane , with all the basic requirements of the electroweak model .",
    "the key ingredient of the present proposal is that the positions at which 5-d fermions end up localized depend on their @xmath0 charges .",
    "this allows , for example , to break the @xmath3 and @xmath4 representations of @xmath0 down to the lepton and quark representations of @xmath2 , respectively , and confine them to a single brane . in this construction",
    "it is possible to identify the higgs field with the fifth component of the localized bulk gauge field .",
    "additionally , new fields inevitably appear in the resulting 4-d effective theory .",
    "these are : a left - handed neutrino with zero - hypercharge , and a massive vector field coupling together the new neutrino with other left - handed leptons .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec . [ s2 ] we introduce the split fermion scenario and explain how the localization of @xmath0 fermions to different positions in the bulk is produced .",
    "then , in sec",
    ". [ s3 ] we analyze the confinement of gauge fields .",
    "there we argue that the gauge symmetry of the localized fermions is transferred to the gauge fields near the brane . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , we show that the electroweak model can be constructed by putting these two mechanisms together . there , the hierarchy problem is also addressed .",

    "[ f6 ] ) .     representation and its decomposition into @xmath191 subgroups : this is @xmath239 with charges @xmath238 , respectively.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    then , we obtain the following four massless chiral fermions confined to the first brane : the right - handed @xmath191-singlet @xmath240 with charge @xmath241 ; the two left - handed components of the @xmath191-doublet @xmath242 with charges @xmath243 and @xmath244 ; and only one right - handed component from the triplet @xmath245 , with charge @xmath246 .",
    "figure [ f7 ] shows those components of the @xmath185 that confine to @xmath21 .",
    "that end up localized to @xmath21 .",
    "the labels @xmath77 and @xmath209 indicate the chirality of the confined states.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    when the effective lagrangian is computed we find the appropriate quantum numbers for this sector to be identified with the quarks of the standard model . a significant difference with the lepton case",
    ", however , is the absence of interactions between quarks and the vector field @xmath142 .",
    "we have seen that the electron and @xmath232-boson masses are @xmath247 and @xmath248 respectively .",
    "what is more , the quark masses are found to be proportional to @xmath249 , of the same order as the electron mass .",
    "this is just the hierarchy problem for the particular case of the present model ( recall that the @xmath168-couplings are all of the same order ) .",
    "a simple way to correct this problem is to introduce a new term in the definition of @xmath169 .",
    "for example , we could consider a new coupling @xmath250 of the form : @xmath251 where @xmath252 is a dimensionless coefficient that could depend on the representation on which @xmath250 is acting ( observe the similarity of the new term with the old one @xmath253 , in @xmath169 ) . then , after the scalars have acquired the v.e.v .",
    "discussed before , the @xmath250 coupling becomes : @xmath254 the second term of this expression resembles the 5-d mass term of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 : l - split ] ) .",
    "therefore , the fermion wave functions will be split around the branes and an exponential factor [ like the one of eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawa - supp ] ) ] will appear suppressing the couplings of eq .",
    "( [ eq : leptons - i2 ] ) .",
    "this results in a hierarchy between the mass scales of quarks , leptons and electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "observe that in the definition of @xmath169 we could also include terms proportional to @xmath255 and @xmath256 with coefficients depending on the representation .",
    "they would provide additional terms contributing to the split of fermions around the brane .",
    "to finish , let us briefly mention that other branes are also formed in the bulk .",
    "they appear from the localization of the rest of the states in the @xmath3 and @xmath175 representations .",
    "the most interesting brane is the `` mirror brane '' at @xmath208 , which contains a copy of the electroweak model obtained at the first brane @xmath21 but with states having opposite chiralities .",
    "the rest of the branes ( also determined by the condition @xmath197 ) all contain different versions of @xmath257 abelian gauge theories .",
    "figure [ f8 ] shows the 5-d configuration obtained in the construction .    , while the mirror brane ( a copy of the first brane but containing matter with opposite chirality ) is located at @xmath208.,scaledwidth=37.0% ]",
    "in this paper we have obtained a simple realization of the electroweak model confined to a brane .",
    "the mechanism consisted in breaking the @xmath0 gauge symmetry down in @xmath2 through the localization of bulk fermions to the brane .",
    "the localization was produced by the coupling @xmath169 , of eq .",
    "( [ eq : y ] ) , between @xmath0 fermions and scalar fields with non - zero vacuum expectation values . as in the split fermion scenario ,",
    "the four - dimensional fermions at the brane were found to be chiral .",
    "this allowed us to achieve the electroweak chiral structure by localizing those states ( within given @xmath0-representations ) with appropriate charges to the same brane .",
    "for example , the lepton sector was obtained from the @xmath3 representation , while the quark sector was obtained from the @xmath185 .    remarkably , in this model it was possible to identify the higgs field with the fifth component of the @xmath0 bulk gauge field ( see @xcite for similar approaches ) .",
    "one problem with this result , however , is the apparent difficulty in generating the appropriate potential for the higgs . whether it is possible to obtain such a potential in this particular setup remains an open question .",
    "another feature of the present construction is the presence of two new fields coupled to the lepton sector of the standard model : a four - component vector field @xmath142 ( that transforms like the higgs under @xmath2 symmetry transformations ) and a left - handed neutrino @xmath166 ( with zero - hypercharge ) .",
    "the existence of these particles opens up interesting phenomenological possibilities .",
    "for instance , the nonobservation of @xmath258-bosons pair - production at lep @xcite is an indication of the constraint : @xmath259 nevertheless , from the results of this paper we should not expect a value @xmath260 significantly higher than @xmath261 and @xmath262 . at the same time",
    ", the mechanism generating the hierarchy between leptons , quarks and gauge bosons , is also suppressing the couplings between @xmath258 and leptons .",
    "if this is the case , then we could expect new phenomena associated with extra - dimensions in lepton - collider experiments in the near future .",
    "let us finish by mentioning that an important question that still needs to be addressed within this model is how to include the mixing between different families of leptons and quarks .",
    "for instance , in the case of leptons , the new neutrino @xmath166 could be playing some relevant role in the mixing of neutrinos .",
