    "the complex dynamics of coupled nonlinear oscillators has gained significant research interest in many branches of science and technology @xcite , ranging from the modeling of biological rhythms in the heart @xcite , nervous system @xcite , intestine @xcite and pancreas@xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing emergent phenomena is the so - called amplitude death ( ad ) , a phenomenon that coupled oscillators stop oscillation and settle to a quenched steady state . since the initial work by bar - eli @xcite , ad has been observed in various real systems , such as the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction system @xcite , relativistic magnetrons @xcite , and synthetic genetic networks @xcite , to list just a few .",
    "the physical mechanism underlying ad has also been extensively investigated@xcite . for coupled oscillators on a regular lattice , mechanisms leading to ad may include oscillator mismatch @xcite , delayed coupling @xcite , asymmetric coupling @xcite , time - dependent coupling @xcite , conjugate coupling @xcite , nonlinear ( nondiffusive ) coupling @xcite , linear augmentation @xcite , and so on @xcite .",
    "see a recent review @xcite for more details , which gives the deep insight and many clues for understanding ad induced by different scenarios .    on the other hand , ad in complex networks of coupled oscillators has also attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that network topologies , being regular @xcite , random @xcite , small - world @xcite or scale - free @xcite , may influence ad in a nontrivial way , by enhancing or suppressing it with varying network randomness or heterogeneity",
    ". nevertheless , previous studies on ad in complex networks only deal with the case of immobile individuals and each network node is occupied by one single individual .",
    "very recently , the metapopulation network model @xcite , which incorporates local node population , mobility over the nodes , and a complex network structure , has drawn intensive attention .",
    "this model has been successfully exploited in different contexts , including epidemic spreading @xcite , biological pattern formation @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , population evolution @xcite , and many other spatially distributed systems @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the density and the mobility of the individuals could have drastic impact on the emergence of collective behaviors in general @xcite , and particularly , density and mobility induced synchronization of coupled oscillators has been reported @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may ask : how would the mobility and the density would influence ad in metapopulation networks of coupled oscillators ?    in the present work , we study the emergence of ad in a metapopulation model which incorporates mobility over a complex network together with local interactions of the individuals at the network nodes .",
    "we find that , for small mobility rate and lower density , the metapopulation displays incoherent state , for intermediate mobility rate or density , all the oscillators spontaneously cease their oscillations , but for large ones , the death state can be eliminated and synchronize to a common frequency , overcoming the disorder in their natural frequencies .",
    "furthermore , we show this nontrivial phenomenon is robust to different network topologies .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 distinct subpopulations labeled @xmath1 , each corresponding to a network node .",
    "the density @xmath2 of the metapopulation is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of individuals in node @xmath1 .",
    "individuals inside each subpopulation run stochastically through the paradigmatic landau - stuart oscillators @xcite , whose dynamics is described by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the complex amplitude of the ( @xmath7 ) oscillator in the @xmath1-th node , @xmath8 denotes a homogeneous oscillation growth rate , @xmath9 is the coupling strength , and @xmath10 is the mean field inside node @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the natural frequency of the _ _ j__th oscillator within node @xmath1 , which is picked up from a certain distribution . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt a linear distribution @xmath12 with @xmath13 a constant . without coupling ,",
    "the trajectory of each single oscillator will settle to a limit cycle with frequency @xmath14 and radius @xmath15 . with sufficiently strong @xmath9 and wide distribution of @xmath16 ,",
    "the oscillators pull each other off their limit cycles , and collapse into a state of zero amplitude @xmath17 , i.e. , an ad state .",
    "the above equation actually defines the reaction process that governs the temporal behavior of each individual inside the metapopulation nodes .",
    "we now assume that the individuals can diffusion randomly among the nodes .",
    "the system evolves in time according to the following rules @xcite .",
    "we introduce a discrete time step @xmath18 representing the fixed time scale of the process .",
    "the reaction and diffusion rates are therefore converted into probabilities . in the reaction step ,",
    "all the individuals are updated in parallel according to eq.[eqmodel ] .",
    "after that , diffusions take place by allowing each individual to move into a randomly chosen neighboring node with probability @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the mobility rate . if not otherwise specified , the parameters are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we choose the mobility rate @xmath20 and the density @xmath2 as main control parameters .",
    "each simulation plot is obtained via averaging over 20 independent runs .",
    "to begin , we consider scale - free networks generated by using the barabsi ",
    "albert ( ba ) model @xcite with power - law degree distribution @xmath26 .",
    "we fix @xmath27 ( thus we have totally @xmath28 individual oscillators ) and vary @xmath20 to investigate how the oscillators evolve in time .",
    "initially , the oscillators are homogeneous distributed among the nodes . if diffusion is absent ( @xmath29 ) , each node will stay in an incoherent state for the above - mentioned parameters .",
    "if @xmath20 is small , each node still remains incoherent , as shown in fig.1(a ) for @xmath30 , where typical time series of @xmath31 for several randomly - chosen oscillators within a random chosen node are depicted . for moderate diffusion rate @xmath32 as shown in fig.1(b ) , the time series eventually collapse into @xmath33 , which indicates the occurrence of global ad .",
    "however , for sufficiently large @xmath20 , say @xmath34 in fig.1(c ) , the oscillators are locked to a synchronized state .",
    "therefore , we observe an interesting mobility induced transition from incoherence to ad and then to synchronization in our metapopulation oscillator network model .",
    "in addition , we have also perform simulations with fixed @xmath20 and varying @xmath2 .",
    "similar behaviors ( time series not shown ) are found , i , e , the system will also undergo a density induced transition from incoherence to ad and then to synchronization with increasing @xmath2 given @xmath20 is not too small .    to quantitatively manifest the collective oscillation intensity of the system , we choose the normalized mean incoherent energy @xmath35 and coherent energy @xmath36 as the characteristic variables , which are defined as @xcite    @xmath37 , \\nonumber \\\\ w & = & \\left[{\\frac{{\\langle { { | { \\sum\\nolimits_{\\mu = 1}^{n } \\sum\\nolimits_{j = 1}^{n_\\mu } { { z_j^\\mu } } } |^2}}\\rangle } } { { { { n_p}^2}r } } } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the brackets @xmath38 denotes averaging over time and @xmath39 $ ] stands for averaging over 20 different network realizations for each @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "a large @xmath35 means relatively large average oscillation amplitudes , while a larger @xmath36 implicates more synchronous oscillations @xcite . in the incoherent state",
    ", @xmath36 will be nearly zero but @xmath35 can be large . for ad state , both @xmath35 and @xmath36 should be nearly zero . in the synchronized state ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 both have noteworthy nonzero values and they should be equal for complete synchronization .",
    "the dependences of @xmath35 and @xmath36 on @xmath20 for fixed @xmath40 and @xmath2 for fixed @xmath41 are depicted in fig.[fig2 ] , wherein the curves can be divided into three stages . in stage 1 , @xmath35 decreases monotonously with increasing @xmath20(@xmath2 ) , approaching nearly zero at a certain value of @xmath20(@xmath2 ) . in stage 2 , both @xmath35 and @xmath36 remain nearly zero , demonstrating the occurrence of global @xmath42 .",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath36 increase with @xmath20(@xmath2 ) in stage 3 , corresponding to the synchronized state . in accordance with fig.1 , the transition from incoherence to global ad and then to synchronization is clearly demonstrated .",
    "it seems that increasing density plays a similar role to increasing the mobility .",
    "of particular interest , there exists a notable region ( stage 2 ) for both @xmath20 and @xmath2 where the system remains stably in the ad state .    to further get a global picture",
    ", we have perform extensive simulations to obtain the phase diagram in the @xmath43 plane .",
    "this is shown in fig.3 , where the contour plots of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are drawn .",
    "as expected , when both @xmath20 and @xmath2 are small , the system shows the incoherent state ( the light region 1 of fig . [ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "when @xmath20 and @xmath2 are increased crossing certain critical values , the system finally evolves into global ad state ( the dark region 2 of fig.[fig3](a ) ) . for sufficiently large @xmath20 and @xmath2 , however , the system may undergo a phase transition again from the death phase to synchronized one , as shown in the light region 3 of fig . [ fig3](a ) .",
    "thus as we keep one of the parameters fixed ( @xmath20 or @xmath2 ) and increase the other , we observe transitions from the incoherent ( region 1 ) to the amplitude death ( region 2 ) and then to frequency synchronized state ( region 3 ) . note that the @xmath44 transition is not observable with increasing @xmath2 if the mobility rate @xmath20 is too small , and similarly , the @xmath45 transition can not happen if the density @xmath2 is too low .",
    "so far , the results are all for scale - free coupled networks .",
    "one may wondering whether the interesting findings above is sensitive to the network topology or not .",
    "thus , we have also performed similar studies on other types of networks , e.g. , the small world network and random network .",
    "the phase diagrams are shown in fig.[fig4 ] ( a , b ) for small - world network and ( c , d ) for random network , respectively . apparently , the qualitative behaviors are the same as those observed in scale - free networks .",
    "the only difference is that the boundaries between different phase regions are slightly shifted .",
    "in summary , we have studied the collective dynamics of coupled limit cycle oscillators defined on metapopulation networks , where different subpopulations are connected by fluxes of individuals . by extensive numerical simulations ,",
    "we show that mobility and density play nontrivial roles on the collective behavior of the system , by demonstrating an interesting type of density or mobility induced transition into and out from oscillation death behavior . on one hand , intermediate mobility rate and density can induce global oscillator death . on the other hand , large mobility rate and density",
    "can also eliminate oscillator death and lead to synchronization .",
    "in addition , we find that this nontrivial phenomenon is robust to the network topology .",
    "the underlying mechanisms for these interesting results are still open",
    ". an analytical theory would surely be greatly helpful , however , it is not available at the current stage and should certainly deserve more study . since many real - life networks ( cellular networks , protein networks , gene networks , _",
    "etc_. ) inevitably involve variances in both the mobility and the density , and their collective dynamics could be modeled by coupled oscillators , these results may find a variety of applications . our study may also stimulate further investigation on the emergent coherence of metapopulations of coupled oscillators .",
