    "the assembly of planets is a complex and multi - faceted phenomenon that spans a gulf of some 12 orders of magnitude in length : from micron - sized dust to @xmath0 km planetary cores .",
    "it draws on an equally wide range of physical processes : collisions , dust - gas aerodynamics , gravitational collapse , instabilities , and disk structures ( e.g.  vortices , dust traps ) , to name but a few ( papaloizou & terquem 2006 , chiang & youdin 2010 , armitage 2010 ) .",
    "while it is relatively straightforward to grow cm sized particles from micron sizes , further growth is potentially halted by a number of ` barriers ' ( bouncing , fragmentation , radial - drift ; johansen et al .",
    "statistically a small number of ` lucky ' aggregates may hurdle these , but certain collective instabilities can aid aggregation through this difficult size range .",
    "these include classical gravitational instability ( gi ; safronov 1969 , ward & goldreich 1973 ) , streaming instability ( youdin & goodman 2005 ) , and the secular gravitational instability ( sgi ; ward 2000 , youdin 2005 ) .",
    "it is to the last instability that this paper is devoted .",
    "one of the most attractive features of the single - fluid sgi is that its onset is unconditional ; it should always be present .",
    "unlike classical gi , which requires the toomre parameter to be less than one , a single fluid analysis presents no analogous restriction : the sgi works no matter how thin or thick the particle sub - disk ( youdin 2005 ) . the instability attacks longer scales preferentially , which ordinarily would be stabilised by the coriolis force ; but particles can shed ( or gain )",
    "angular momentum via areodynamical drag , and hence are not obliged to undergo stabilising epicycles . as a consequence , rings that are radially drifting towards each other continue to do so unimpeded , and the instability can proceed . on small radial scales the sgi is suppressed by dust pressure or gas turbulence , and in fact , for well - coupled dust , turbulence decreases growth rates to potentially insignificant levels ( shariff & cuzzi 2011 , youdin 2011 ) .",
    "marginally coupled particles , however , could still be subject to respectable sgi growth rates at certain radii .",
    "the sgi has been thoroughly explored in single fluid models , which are applicable when the dust to gas density ratio is tiny ( e.g.  ward 2000 , youdin 2005 , shariff & cuzzi 2011 , youdin 2011 , michikoshi et al .  2012 ) .",
    "these models assume that the angular momentum bestowed onto , or removed from , the gas disk is negligible . on sufficiently long scales ,",
    "however , both sides of this momentum transaction must be included and the gas dynamics explicitly calculated .",
    "an instability criterion then appears : in a two - fluid model the onset of sgi is no longer unconditional .",
    "recently , takahashi & inutsuka ( 2014 , hereafter ti ) made a start on this problem ( see also shadmehri 2016 and takahashi & inutsuka 2016 ) , but there is still much to be established",
    ". putting aside the issue of growth rates , an especially important question is : at what radii and for what particle sizes should we expect sgi to exist at all ?",
    "the first aim of this paper is to derive clean stability criteria for the sgi . in the limits of strongly - coupled and weakly - coupled particles",
    "these can be formulated analytically and involve a variety of parameters , including the gas s toomre parameter and the dust - to - gas density ratio . because they bypass the sgi s full 6th order dispersion relation , these criteria make it relatively easy to assess its prevalence .",
    "the criteria also motivate a straightforward physical picture of instability in a two - fluid system . in order for the instability to work , there",
    "must exist an intermediate range of lengthscales gas upon which ( a ) dust pressure or turbulent mass diffusion is subdominant , and ( b ) the gas is prevented from executing epicycles , despite its angular momentum transactions with the dust .",
    "going to lengthscales longer than the dust pressure ( or diffusion ) scale takes care of the first restriction . but the second can only be satisfied if geostrophic balance holds in the gas fluid , and so we must simultaneously find shortish scales upon which gas pressure is dominant .",
    "the existence or not of this intermediate range furnishes us with the stability criterion .",
    "the formalism is applied to realistic disk models , where we find that it is unlikely that well - coupled dust is unstable to the sgi at any radius , unless the background turbulence is especially weak .",
    "marginally coupled particles , however , can achieve appreciable growth rates in certain circumstances , emphasising that the sgi could help aggregation of solids of cm size .",
    "we conclude , however , that sgi is probably unrelated to the dust rings recently observed by alma ( brogan et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the paper will be organised in the following way .",
    "first , in section 2 , we present the two - fluid razor - thin disk model that we employ , alongside a critical discussion of its shortcomings .",
    "the main parameters of the analysis will also be defined . in section 3",
    "we revisit the single - fluid model to fix some ideas and to provide context for the subsequent analysis , while in section 4 we briefly treat a simple two - fluid system where the gas is regarded as incompressible .",
    "the main results of the paper are in section 5 , in which we derive analytic stability criteria in relevant limits that are then applied to realistic disk models in section 6 .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section 7 , where we discuss the relevance of the sgi in planet and structure formation in protostellar disks .",
    "the classical gi and secular gi have primarily been explored with 1d models of a vertically averaged or razor - thin disk .",
    "recent notable exceptions are mamatsashvili & rice ( 2010 ) and lin ( 2014 ) , who also capture vertical convection and the magnetorotational instability respectively .",
    "a 1d model certainly eases the analysis and it should be a reasonable approximation for unstable modes whose radial wavelength is much greater than the disk thickness ; because the classical gi has minimal vertical structure ( being essentially an f - mode in this limit ; ogilvie 1998 ) , it is also likely that the sgi depends on @xmath1 only weakly . for wavelengths closer to the scale height , a somewhat ad hoc correction",
    "may be included ( e.g.  shu 1984 ) , which generally works against instability on these shorter lengthscales .    in a two - fluid model , however ,",
    "the razor - thin assumption is complicated by the fact that the particle fluid and the gas fluid possess different thicknesses , and the former can be significantly shorter than the latter .",
    "this is a problem for the sgi because the fastest lengthscales are not far from the particle scale height ( youdin 2005 ) , and hence of order or less than the gas scale height . as a consequence ,",
    "the approximation of a razor - thin disk is not strictly applicable , at least in the description of the gas . in a single fluid model",
    "this issue does not crop up because it is assumed that the gas fluid is unperturbed by whatever the dust is doing ; but in a two fluid model this is not the case .",
    "it may be that the gas perturbations associated with the sgi are sufficiently small that the disk s vertical structure plays little role .",
    "but only calculations in vertically stratified shearing boxes can decide on this point .",
    "a second issue is the correct coupling between the two fluids . in a real system , with different gas and dust scale heights ,",
    "the drag acceleration will be a function of vertical height @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the entire column of gas will not exert drag on the dust if the dust subdisk is much thinner .",
    "for consistency , the gas _ external _ to the dust disk should be excluded from a two - fluid razor - thin treatment , with the weighting of the drag force in the momentum equation adjusted appropriately to account for the smaller surface density of the gas subdisk . because most of the mass in both disks is near the midplane , this problem may not invalidate the main qualitative results .",
    "it should , however , be kept in mind .",
    "a third issue concerns turbulence in the gas , its effects , and how to mathematically describe it .",
    "the gas is likely undergoing disordered motions at some ( perhaps all ) radii , though the underlying physics may differ between different regions ( turner et al .",
    "the disk may also support turbulence because of the settling of the dust to the midplane , and ensuing vertical kelvin - helmholtz instability ( cuzzi et al .  1993 ) .",
    "the consequences of turbulence on particles are several .",
    "agitation of the solids produces enhanced velocity dispersions , over and above that arising from particle collisions ( goldreich & tremaine 1978 ) , and thus an appreciable particle pressure that will oppose vertical settling .",
    "the precise ` equation of state ' this pressure obeys , however , is difficult to establish .",
    "in addition , the random motions induced in the dust can potentially smooth away inhomogeneities in the dust density , and thus lead to diffusion in the continuity equation directly ( youdin 2011 , shariff & cuzzi 2011 , takahashi & inutsuka 2012 ) .",
    "the efficiency of this diffusion is pretty much unconstrained and obviously requires numerical exploration ; for instance , the vertical kelvin - helmholtz instability will mix particles effectively in the vertical direction but not necessarily in the horizontal . finally , turbulence will transport momentum , though this effect ( being a straightforward mild damping ) we do not include in this paper ( see ti for its treatment ) .",
    "the effects of turbulence on the dust have been mathematically modelled via mean - field theories , and langevin and fokker - planck equations ( e.g.  schrpler & henning 2004 , carballido et al .  2006 , youdin & lithwick 2007 ) . given a kolmogorov spectrum of isotropic homogeneous turbulent motions , youdin & lithwick ( 2007 )",
    "derive convenient expressions for the dust velocity dispersion and the turbulent diffusivity of particle mass , in terms of the stopping time and a turbulent efficiency parameter ( described below ) .",
    "such a calculation , of course , must assume that the turbulent flux of particles behaves as a fickian diffusion  which it need not , especially on scales close to the largest ` eddy ' .",
    "other complications could arise from the flux s finite relaxation time and possible anti - diffusive behaviour ( especially on small scales , e.g.  frisch 1995 davidson 2000 , cuzzi et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "our purpose in this paper is not to improve on any of these issues , but it is important to flag them at this point .",
    "we persist with the simple models previously employed ( e.g.  ti , shadmehri 2016 ) , mainly because they can fix ideas and establish clear results , and presumably give approximately correct predictions",
    ". future work , however , should involve vertically stratified models along the lines of mamatsashvili & rice ( 2010 ) and lin ( 2014 ) .",
    "as will become clear by section 5 , the two - fluid secular gi is governed by a large number of parameters ; it is hence convenient to define them all in one place .",
    "the first key parameter is the dust - to - gas mass ratio , denoted by @xmath2 and defined via @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the background surface density of the dust with size @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the surface density of the gas located _ within the dust subdisk _",
    "( see earlier ) .",
    "thus @xmath2 is a function of @xmath5 .",
    "because the sgi is size - selective it is necessary to distinguish between particles of different sizes , and thus to use separate surface densities for each subspecies . to ease the analysis in this paper",
    "we examine each dust species separately , though in reality different species will weakly couple via the gas phase .",
    "see shadmehri ( 2016 ) for an attack on a system of interacting gas and two species of particle .    generally , @xmath4 is a small fraction of the total solid surface density .",
    "in fact , the surface density of mm and cm sized particles can be significantly less than 1% of the total ( e.g.  brauer et al .",
    "2008 , windmark et al .  2012a , 2012b ) , though this figure varies greatly with age and as different physical processes are included or neglected ( sticking , bouncing , fragmentation , and mass tranfer , for instance ; garaud et al .",
    "note that @xmath6 will also be less than the total gas density , as it only includes gas situated amongst the dust subdisk .",
    "this decrease can be quantified by a factor @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the scale thicknesses of the gas and dust respectively .",
    "we may then write @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total dust surface density ( including all species ) , and we have assumed that the ratio of total dust to total gas density takes the standard value 0.01 ( chiang & youdin 2010 ) . given the large uncertainties in the second and third factors in eq .",
    "( small and large respectively ) , we simply set @xmath12 for most calculations .",
    "inverse stokes number @xmath13 as a function of radius for different particle sizes and two different minimum mass solar nebulae models , as calculated from youdin ( 2011 ) but only using the epstein drag regime .",
    "the @xmath14 case corresponds to a nebula with a gas surface density of 2000 g@xmath15 at 1 au , while @xmath16 corresponds to 200 g@xmath15 .",
    "[ mmsn].,width=377 ]    the second key parameter is the inverse stokes number , which we denote by @xmath13 and define through @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the stopping time of the particles , and @xmath19 is the local orbital frequency .",
    "large values of @xmath13 correspond , thus , to strongly coupled particles , and smaller values to weakly coupled particles .",
    "the exact value of @xmath13 depends on particle size , naturally , but also on radial location ( e.g.  chiang & youdin 2010 ) . fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] gives @xmath13 profiles for two different minimum mass solar nebulae ( mmsn ) models .",
    "see section 6 for more details .",
    "the third parameter is the ratio of dust and gas velocity dispersions , defined through @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the velocity dispersion of the dust and gas respectively . to a first approximation ,",
    "the dust random velocities are controlled by ` kicks ' delivered by the gas turbulence , rather than inter - particle collisions ( youdin & lithwick 2007 ) .",
    "thus it is possible to relate @xmath23 to properties of the turbulence , and we do so below .",
    "collisional agitation becomes important for larger particles @xmath24 cm , and thus the @xmath23 we use in this paper may be an underestimate for these sizes .",
    "the fourth parameter is the toomre @xmath25 of the dust , which describes the onset of classical gi .",
    "it is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the gravitation constant and for notational convenience we have dropped the subscript ` @xmath5 ' from the surface density .",
    "an analogous expression can be defined for the gas , which we denote by @xmath28 .",
    "the two toomre parameters can be related via the following identity : @xmath29 .",
    "finally , the turbulent diffusion of solid particles can be quantified via the mass diffusivity @xmath30 , and the diffusion of gas by the analogous @xmath31 . as in youdin ( 2011 )",
    ", we replace these by the dimensionless parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , via @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with these related via @xmath36 ( youdin & lithwick 2007 , youdin 2011 ) .",
    "the dust s velocity dispersion ( if excited by turbulence ) can also be expressed in terms of @xmath33 and we find @xmath37 thus @xmath33 governs both @xmath30 and @xmath23 .",
    "unfortunately , an estimate of its magnitude is one of the great uncertainties in the theory , though it is likely to be smaller ( and possible much smaller ) than the analogous dimensionless coefficient associated with angular momentum transport in the gas ( @xmath38 in a protoplanetary disk ) .",
    "for instance , if transport is controlled by magnetocentrifugal winds or strong zonal magnetic fields then the bulk of the disk could even be laminar ( e.g.  lesur et al .",
    "2014 , bai 2014 ) .",
    "having said that , vertical settling should always lead to disordered motions and some degree of radial diffusion . putting these considerations aside ,",
    "it is clear that strongly coupled particles ( @xmath39 ) have @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; whereas weakly coupled particles ( @xmath42 ) are diffused less effectively @xmath43 and are far ` colder ' , @xmath44 .",
    "though the single fluid analysis of the sgi is well - trodden territory we include it here for completeness and because it helps fix useful ideas that appear later .",
    "one especially important theme that crops up is geostrophic balance and the purely azimuthal ` zonal ' flows that ensue .",
    "as we are interested in relatively short radial scales it is convenient to employ the shearing sheet model ( goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ) , whereby a small portion of disk , centred upon a fixed radius @xmath45 , is represented by a cartesian box . in a corotating frame",
    "centred on the box , @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the local radial and azimuthal coordinates , while @xmath19 is the orbital frequency at @xmath45 .",
    "the disk is assumed to be razor thin , so that the dust volumetric density is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the dust surface density and @xmath50 the dirac delta function ( not the dust - to - gas mass ratio ) .",
    "the equations governing the evolution of the dust fluid are given by the continuity , momentum , and poisson equations : @xmath51 where @xmath49 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 denote the dust surface density , velocity , and pressure .",
    "again we have dropped the subscript ` @xmath5 ' from the surface density ; it is understood from here onwards that @xmath49 refers to the surface density of particles of size @xmath5 .",
    "the potentials associated with the dust self - gravity and tide are @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "the gas velocity is given by @xmath56 , and it interacts with the dust via a drag term whose strength is quantified by the inverse stokes number @xmath13 .    in this section",
    "it is assumed that there is no appreciable backreaction of the dust on the gas motion .",
    "moreover , we neglect the effect of any radial pressure gradient on the gas s orbital rotation .",
    "it is thus keplerian and steady : @xmath57 . in realistic disks",
    "there is likely to be a fluctuating component of the gas motion due to turbulence , which acts as a forcing term in the dust momentum equation , giving rise to velocity fluctuations in the dust",
    ". we will be interested in the large - scale mean dust velocity , rather than these fluctuations ; the latter s effects may be captured by a turbulent pressure tensor in the momentum equation and a turbulent radial flux in the continuity equation .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 terms are the manifestations of these two effects .",
    "finally , given that we have assumed a dust pressure , we must stipulate the dust s equation of state , relating @xmath49 , particle velocity dispersion @xmath21 , and @xmath53 .",
    "this is not straightforward , especially if the dust velocity dispersion is dominated by the turbulent gas fluctuations . as our intention is to provide a broad physical explanation of underlying physics , rather than detailed modelling , we assume for simplicity that the dust fluid is isothermal , and so @xmath60 , where @xmath21 is constant .",
    "the governing one - fluid equations admit an equilibrium characterised by a constant density @xmath61 and the perfect entrainment of the dust in the gas , both undergoing keplerian motion @xmath62 . to this steady state",
    "we add small axisymmetric perturbation , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , proportional to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a growth rate and @xmath67 is a radial wavenumber .",
    "their linearised equations are @xmath68 where the perturbed gravitational potential is given by @xmath69 ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) and where we have set @xmath70 for the time being .",
    "eliminating the primed variables produces a relatively neat third order dispersion relation : @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the standard expression for the squared frequency of density waves in a 1d inviscid disk .",
    "this agrees with multiple examples in the literature , notably in ward ( 2000 ) and youdin ( 2005 ) , and also in youdin ( 2011 ) , and shareef & cuzzi ( 2011 ) , when turbulent diffusion is omitted .",
    "it is worthwhile examining the classical case with no drag , i.e. when @xmath73 .",
    "the dispersion simplifies and one obtains @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the first pair of solutions corresponds to 1d density waves , which can grow on a band of intermediate wavenumbers @xmath67 girdling @xmath76 the instability criterion requires the toomre parameter @xmath77 to be less than 1 ( e.g.  safronov 1969 , goldreich & ward 1973 ) .",
    "radial collapse on long wavelengths is impeded by epicyclic motion induced by the inertial forces , whereas short wavelengths modes are stabilised by pressure .",
    "( note that nonlinear non - axisymmetric instability occurs for larger @xmath78 . )",
    "the dust , however , must be rather thin in order to achieve @xmath79 ( e.g.  cuzzi et al .",
    "1993 , chiang & youdin 2010 )    the @xmath75 ` quasi - geostrophic ' mode neither grows nor oscillates , but instead corresponds to a steady ` zonal flow ' . from eq . , the fundamental balance is between the coriolis force , on one hand , and self - gravity and pressure , on the other .",
    "the mode corresponds to a radially varying sequence of super and sub - keplerian orbital motions ( or ` jets ' ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the associated pressure perturbation .",
    "the pressure gradient negates any type of epicyclic motion .",
    "this type of flow plays an important part in the secular gi , as will be made clear in the following sections , and indeed in the streaming instability ( jacquet et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "growth rates of the secular gi in a single fluid for @xmath82 and two different values of @xmath13 , 0.1 ( weakly coupled ) and 100 ( strongly coupled ) .",
    "the solid curves represent the full solution to the dispersion relation , whereas the points correspond to the asymptotic estimates and .,width=340 ]      being a cubic , the dispersion relation does not yield simple formulae for the various growth rates .",
    "it is straightforward , however , to obtain a general stability criterion and asymptotic expressions in the limit of strong and weak drag .    the last term in the cubic reveals that linear instability is assured when @xmath83 , which is satisifed for all modes with sufficiently small wavenumbers @xmath84 .",
    "hence instability is unconditional , though in practice ( putting aside the disk s global structure and cylindrical geometric effects ) an unstable dust layer must have radial extent greater than @xmath85 or else there will insufficient space for the modes to manifest themselves .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we plot numerical growth rates of the secular gi for parameters characteristic of the two limits . superimposed",
    "are the leading order estimates taken from eqs and below .",
    "when @xmath42 we are in the weak drag regime corresponding to larger particles , at larger disk radii , in less massive disks .",
    "eq . then yields two density waves : @xmath86 which are unstable , as expected , when @xmath79 and thus correspond to the classical gi .",
    "otherwise the two waves are mildly damped by drag .",
    "the third secular mode exhibits a growth rate of @xmath87 instability is assured when @xmath88 , in accordance with the stability criterion derived above .",
    "the fastest growing mode possesses @xmath89 and the maximum growth rate is @xmath90 the mode always grows , but for large @xmath25 the growth rate can be small .    in the limit of small @xmath13 ,",
    "the unstable mode is , in fact , a modified zonal flow . in eq .",
    ", the dominant balance is _ quasi - geostrophic _ ,",
    "i.e. between the pressure gradient , self - gravity , and the coriolis force ( because @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) . using eq .  , with eqs and , gives then precisely the leading order term for @xmath66 .",
    "in the strong drag limit , @xmath93 , the sgi grows at a rate of @xmath94 instability occurs for the exact same range of @xmath67 as in the opposed weak drag limit , but the maximum growth rate is slightly altered @xmath95 and the mode works through a different arrangement of forces . in eq .   instead of radial geostrophic balance ,",
    "it is the last three terms that are dominant : radial contraction by self - gravity is met by the drag force and pressure .",
    "essentially , the dust has achieved _",
    "terminal velocity_. solving for @xmath96 and using yields the leading term for @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , there exist two density waves with @xmath97 . as in the weak coupling limit , they grow exponentially when @xmath79 but are otherwise weakly damped by drag at a rate @xmath98 .      for completeness",
    "we next consider the impact of turbulent mass diffusivity , focussing especially on the critical wavenumber at which instability is quenched .",
    "letting @xmath99 , and taking the limit of weak drag , @xmath100 , the leading order expression for the growth rate picks up a term @xmath101 .",
    "the critical @xmath67 is then easy to compute : @xmath102 the importance of turbulent diffusion versus pressure is quantified by @xmath103 . for weakly coupled particles",
    ", this parameter is @xmath104 , using the estimates on turbulent diffusion and velocity dispersion from section 2 .",
    "this is saying that turbulence is roughly as important as dust pressure , at least in setting the short scale cut - off for sgi .",
    "nonetheless , in the remainder of the paper we often omit diffusion when dealing with weakly coupled particles , primarily in order to derive clean expressions .",
    "the neglect of diffusion will not change these results qualitatively , but will introduce order 1 corrections .",
    "instability criteria should then be regarded as necessary conditions , not sufficient , and maximum growth rates should be understood as upper bounds .    in the opposite limit , @xmath39 , the situation is quite different .",
    "the growth rate is modified by the term @xmath105 , and the importance of turbulent diffusion on small scales is quantified instead by @xmath106 which is @xmath107 . as a consequence , the critical cut - off for small particles",
    "is completely controlled by turbulence , as shown earlier by youdin ( 2011 ) using a heuristic ( but essentially equivalent ) argument .    on account of the subdominance of particle pressure in the face of turbulent diffusion",
    "when @xmath39 , we may dispense with it entirely . in this case ,",
    "instability is assured for sufficiently long wavelengths as earlier , with the asymptotic growth given by @xmath108 and a maximum growth rate of @xmath109 where we have introduced the gas toomre parameter in the last equality , and set @xmath110 ( cf .",
    "section 2.2 ) .",
    "the wavelength of maximum growth is @xmath111 , where @xmath8 is the scale height of the gas disk .",
    "given that in this regime @xmath13 is large but @xmath33 is small , it can be hard to establish this characteristic length a priori .    before moving on",
    ", it should be highlighted that a turbulent mass - diffusion alters the classical gi in unexpected ways .",
    "when @xmath73 and @xmath99 , arbitrarily long wavelengths are rendered unstable , though they grow at negligible rates .",
    "on the other hand , mass diffusion can not completely stabilise short scales - a pressureless turbulent fluid will be unstable for all @xmath67 ( in contrast to the sgi ) .",
    "introducing turbulent momentum diffusion , however , does kill instability for sufficiently large @xmath67 .",
    "we omit details of these calculations .",
    "as has been commented upon in the literature , the secular gi exhibits two striking features : growth for all finite @xmath25 , and growth upon arbitrarily small @xmath67 .",
    "the latter is especially unexpected given that traditional gi prefers intermediate wavelengths , the longer scales stabilised by the dominant coriolis force . how does secular gi overcome the epicyclic response at large scales ?    consider two dust rings located at different radii undergoing circular orbital motion .",
    "each ring contains a quantity of angular momentum naturally associated with its home radius .",
    "suppose the rings are displaced radially towards one another other .",
    "though their mutual self - gravitational attraction will attempt to amplify the displacement , the two rings possess an angular momentum incommensurate with their new radial location and hence undergo epicyclic oscillations that thwart any type of gravitational collapse .",
    "this is the classical picture of stabilisation at long wavelengths .",
    "suppose however that there exists a drag force on both dust rings due to interactions with the background gas .",
    "now when the two rings are radially displaced they will exchange angular momentum with the gas , via the last term in eq .  .",
    "the rings either gain or lose angular momentum until they achieve the amount commensurate with their new radial location . as a result , they do _ not _ undergo epicyclic motion , and self - gravity continues to amplify their radial drift towards one another .",
    "as the two rings collapse they continuously shed or gain angular momentum as needed .",
    "in this way , the epicyclic restoring forces are negated by the drag .",
    "note that this scenario only works if the gas remains an infinite reservoir of angular momentum , which can be removed or added to with no ramifications .",
    "this may be a reasonable approximation in cases where the dust density is far less than the gas density , but on some sufficiently long scale even this must break down .",
    "the question then arises : on what range of scales does the secular gi operate upon , and under what circumstances may we take the single fluid approximation ? for the smooth running of the sgi , the gas fluid must resist undergoing epicyclic oscillation when perturbed by the dust drag . when and how can this be arranged",
    "? these questions will be explored in the following two sections .",
    "as an intermediate step between the single fluid and fully compressible two - fluid models , we briefly analyse the case of a compressible dust disk embedded in an incompressible gas .",
    "this situation mimics the case when the dust scale height is far less than the gas scale height , and the unstable motions very subsonic . on the vertical scale of the dust disk ,",

    "instability hence migrates to longer scales where this effect is weak . on sufficiently long scales ,",

    "the gas , however , being no longer an infinite reservoir of angular momentum undergoes a commensurate perturbation .",

    "if we move to longer and longer scales , the gas pressure weakens and so can only support very mild zonal flows , unable to carry appreciable angular momentum from the drifting dust . as a consequence , the instability is suppressed . on the other hand , whereas the gas is in radial geostrophic balance , the dust can fall into either geostrophic balance ( for @xmath128 ) or terminal velocity balance ( for @xmath93 ) .",
    "in this section we apply the stability criteria and growth rate estimates of the two - fluid model to reasonable models of protoplanetary disks . because of uncertainties in the parameters and deficiencies in the model itself , we do not attempt to be comprehensive or to hold fast to the quantitative results we obtain . rather the aim is to give a sense of the main trends and qualitative behaviour , and the general range of numbers one might find in a real system . to that purpose we first concentrate on the two populations of strongly and marginally coupled particles , using the simple estimates derived previously .",

    "in this paper we have explored the secular gravitational instability ( sgi ) using a simple two - fluid model . despite the complexity of its associated sixth order dispersion relation , analytic stability criteria and growth rates",
    "can be obtained in the two limits of weakly and strongly coupled particles .",
    "we find that on sufficiently long and short radial scales the sgi is stabilised ; the existence of an unstable range of intermediate scales leads to an explicit instability condition involving the gas s toomre parameter , a distinctive feature of the two - fluid sgi , as opposed to the single - fluid version .",
    "the mathematical analysis suggests a straightforward way to understand the instability mechanism .",
    "the sgi favours intermediate scales upon which stabilising dust pressure or turbulence is weak , but upon which the gas pressure is strong .",
    "the latter condition permits the gas to fall into geostrophic balance : hence when the gas is azimuthally accelerated by the dust drag , it will form a zonal flow rather than undergo epicycles that would disrupt the radially collapsing dust .",
    "an assessment of the prevalence of sgi in real disk models is handicapped by uncertainties in two parameters , the strength of the turbulence @xmath33 , and the mass ratio of a certain species of dust to the gas within the dust subdisk , @xmath2 .",
    "starting with a fiducial value of @xmath183 , we find that a moderate level of turbulence @xmath253 prohibits the sgi on most radii , and when it does occur it grows too slowly @xmath264 years  the timescale of the large - scale evolution of the disk , and of appreciable radial drift .",
    "weaker turbulence @xmath258 permits growth for cm sized particles on radii @xmath265 au , with efolding times of a few @xmath260 years .",
    "smaller sized particles may be subject to sgi but grow too slowly .",
    "it is only for @xmath228 that mm sized particles sustain growth at reasonable levels , and then only for @xmath266 au .",
    "increasing @xmath2 improves the situation , of course , and @xmath267 might be the case for particularly well - settled and populous subclasses of particle , though further work is needed to better constrain this parameter .",
    "even so , if @xmath268 it may be prove difficult for the sgi to meaningfully impose itself on the disk dynamics .    we also discuss the various shortcomings of the razor - thin model we employ , which is especially a problem when the dust and gas disks exhibit different scale thicknesses .",
    "these issues no doubt impact quantitatively on our results , but the main qualitative conclusions and our picture of instability should be robust .",
    "they can be checked with a suitable vertically stratified analysis akin to mamatsashvili & rice ( 2010 ) and lin ( 2014 ) , which will also provide more reliable quantitative estimates on the stability curves and growth rates .",
    "our results extend previous analyses of the sgi , and for larger radii are in relative agreement with youdin ( 2011 ) and shariff & cuzzi ( 2011 ) .",
    "a notable difference is that the two - fluid model prohibits sgi on radii less than a critical radius . as a result , the sgi is certainly unviable on radii @xmath269 au , and possibly absent on radii @xmath270 au , the expected regions of planet formation .",
    "the prospects for sgi in the cm class of particles on disk radii @xmath237 au are reasonable as long as gas turbulence is not too efficient @xmath271",
    ". the instability could then be an important route by which large aggregates could form further out , leapfrogging the entire range of difficult cm to km sizes . note that our results are only for axisymmetric instability .",
    "it is likely , via analogy with classical gi , that non - axisymmetric sgi occurs for larger @xmath28 , in which case our stability curves may need some revision .",
    "it has been hypothesised that the sgi generates observed dust ring structures at larger radii in protoplanetary disks ( ti ) . as discussed in section 6",
    ", however , the sgi has great difficulty on radii @xmath265 au for small particle less than a cm in size . the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath2 needs to be increased , and @xmath28 taken to levels approaching 1 in order to obtain instability .",
    "while it may be possible to justify increasing @xmath2 , such a low @xmath28 would mean the gas disk is marginally unstable to classical gi .",
    "perhaps a more important point is that , while the linear phase of the sgi evolution is axisymmetric , its nonlinear phase will most likely involve a non - axisymmetric breadown into disordered flow , as in classical gi , not the formation of large - scale quasi - steady rings .",
    "dedicated nonlinear simulations are required to test what dynamics the sgi exhibits once it reaches nonlinear amplitudes , and how readily it forms planetesimal clumps .",
    "this forms the basis of future work .",
    "the authors thank the reviewer , dick durisen , for a set of comments that led to a much improved manuscript .",
