    "in this section we will review the relevant results of @xcite and then prove theorem  [ thm - hurwitz - monodromy ] .",
    "the key feature of the @xmath21 case of the hurwitz monodromy problem is that @xmath65 is solvable , so that a degree  4 cover @xmath64 determines a number of related covers of @xmath1 , shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . to organize them we will use subscripts to indicate their degrees over @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath64 is connected and simply branched of degree  4 , with @xmath19 branch points @xmath92 , then there is an associated surjection @xmath93 , well - defined up to conjugacy by an element of @xmath65 , sending small loops around the @xmath94 to transpositions .",
    "the corresponding galois cover @xmath95 has @xmath65 as its deck group , and we define @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is klein s viergruppe . @xmath11 itself is @xmath99 for one of the four conjugate @xmath73 s in @xmath65 , so we could write @xmath100 for @xmath11 .",
    "we will refer to the covers @xmath101 , for the three conjugate @xmath102 s in @xmath65 , as `` the 3 @xmath103 s '' . as explained in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath104 is hyperelliptic , @xmath105 has simple branching over the @xmath94 , and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are unramified with deck groups @xmath67 and @xmath79 .",
    "the genera of @xmath108 and @xmath104 are @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "each @xmath103 is simply branched over @xmath1 , with @xmath19 branch points and genus @xmath111 .",

    "each of the @xmath103 s represents the same point of @xmath36 , and @xmath104 represents a point of @xmath114 , yielding a factorization of @xmath113 as @xmath115 .",
    "it is usually more convenient to work with galois covers , so we remark that @xmath116 are equivalent as covers ( i.e. , are the same point of @xmath0 ) if and only if the galois covers @xmath95 and @xmath117 are .",

    "the same argument shows that @xmath118 are equivalent if and only if the galois covers @xmath119 are .",
    "because of this , we will sometimes refer to ( say ) @xmath108 in order to specify a point of @xmath36 .",
    "now we describe the fibers of @xmath114 , @xmath36 and @xmath0 over a @xmath19-tuple @xmath120 in terms of the possibilities for the galois covers @xmath104 , @xmath108 and @xmath95 .",
    "there is only one @xmath104 with specified branch points @xmath92 .",
    "the unramified @xmath121-covers of @xmath104 that are galois over @xmath1 are in bijection with the hyperplanes @xmath122 in @xmath123 that are preserved by the hyperelliptic involution @xmath124 of @xmath104 .",
    "the condition that the galois group be @xmath73 rather than @xmath125 is that @xmath124 act on @xmath126 by negation . since @xmath124 acts by negation on all of @xmath123 , these conditions on @xmath122 are vacuous , and the possibilities for @xmath108 are in bijection with @xmath127 .",
    "once @xmath128 is fixed , the possibilities for @xmath95 are parameterized in a similar but more complicated way .",
    "the unramified covers of @xmath108 with deck group @xmath67 that are galois over @xmath1 are in bijection with the codimension - two subspaces @xmath129 of @xmath130 which are preserved by @xmath131 .",
    "and the condition for the galois group to be @xmath65 rather than some other extension @xmath132 is that @xmath73 acts on @xmath133 in the same way that @xmath134 acts on @xmath98 .",
    "dualizing , the choices for @xmath95 correspond to the subgroups @xmath135 of @xmath136 which @xmath73 preserves and acts on by its 2-dimensional irreducible representation , which permutes triples of elements of @xmath7 with sum @xmath75 .",
    "we write @xmath137 for this set of subspaces , the notation reflecting the fact that it is a projective space in a non - obvious way .    to see this , fix one of the three @xmath103 s , and regard @xmath138 as embedded in @xmath136 under pullback .",
    "every one of the 2-dimensional subspaces of @xmath136 considered above contains a unique @xmath7 lying in @xmath138 , and every @xmath7 in @xmath138 lies in a unique one of these 2-dimensional subspaces .",
    "so @xmath137 is in bijection with @xmath139 .",
    "the three @xmath103 s all give the same projective space structure , so the choices for @xmath95 , given @xmath108 , correspond to points of @xmath140 .",
    "we can even be a little fancier and define @xmath141 as the union of the three @xmath138 s , modulo identification under the group @xmath121 of deck transformations .",
    "then @xmath137 is indeed the projectivization of @xmath141 .    in summary ,",
    "once @xmath92 are fixed , the possibilities for @xmath142 are in bijection with the ordered pairs @xmath143 , where @xmath108 corresponds to an element of @xmath127 and @xmath95 to an element of @xmath137 .",
    "all of these constructions can be carried out simultaneously for all @xmath19-tuples ( this is the basic property of hurwitz spaces ) .",
    "the result is that @xmath0 is an unramified cover of @xmath18 , which factors as @xmath144 , with a fiber of the second map parameterizing the possible choices for @xmath108 ( or equivalently @xmath103 ) .",
    "the fiber of the first map over a chosen @xmath108 is @xmath140 , parameterizing the possible choices for @xmath95 , given @xmath108 .",
    "so a fiber of @xmath0 over @xmath18 consists of @xmath145 many copies of @xmath146 .",
    "we are interested in the monodromy action of @xmath20 on this fiber .",
    "it obviously respects the symplectic structure on @xmath147 , and the stabilizer of @xmath108 preserves the symplectic structure on @xmath148 .",
    "therefore the image @xmath22 can be no larger than in .",
    "having reviewed the results of @xcite , we will now prove the theorem .",

    "we first introduce a little notation for talking about @xmath45 . choosing a point of @xmath36 means choosing a simply branched cover @xmath302 , or equivalently the associated galois cover @xmath128 .",

    "we write @xmath157 for the @xmath150-stabilizer of this point , @xmath108 for the corresponding @xmath73-cover of @xmath1 , and @xmath312 for @xmath313 .",

    "( recall that @xmath321 . ) in both cases the braid generators act by transvections in primitive lattice vectors ( this uses lemma  [ lem - f2-transvection ] , whose proof goes through perfectly well over @xmath44 ) .",
    "these representations are essentially unique , since the transvections in two nonproportional vectors braid if and only if pairing the vectors yields @xmath322 .",

    "he proves that the image of his representation contains the level-@xmath91 congruence subgroup of @xmath320 , so the image of ours does too .",
    "( one can show that our extra generator does nt enlarge the image of the representation . )",
    "follow the proof of lemma  [ lem - surjects - to - factors ] ; the only modification needed is that depending on one s definition of a transvection , @xmath190 might not be one ( e.g.  if 3 is not a square in @xmath8 ) .",
    "but regardless of this choice of definition , if @xmath326 satisfies @xmath327 , then the cyclic group @xmath190 generates contains the transvection @xmath328 .",

    "first we suppose @xmath345 , so that this action is irreducible .",
    "observe that the action of @xmath334 on @xmath343 is by the direct sum of @xmath208 many distinct irreducible representations of @xmath334 .",

    "the scalar matrix @xmath348 in @xmath349 is invariant , the quotient by the span of this vector is irreducible , and there is no invariant complement .",
    "this last property is key , because it implies that the only @xmath334-invariant subspace of @xmath343 that projects onto each factor is the whole product .",
