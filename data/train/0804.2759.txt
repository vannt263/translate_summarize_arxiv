    "with the development of laser cooling and optical trapping technology , quasi one - dimensional ( 1d )  cold atom systems have been realized by tightly confining the particle motion in two directions to zero point oscillation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , optical dipole forces generated by several crossed , interfering laser beams make it possible to create periodic potentials , and experimentalists are able to trap and control small numbers of particles in optical lattice or double well potential .",
    "meanwhile with the feshbach resonance technique , the inter - particle scattering length can be easily changed by tuning a magnetic field , which allows the atoms to enter the full regime of interaction from weakly to strongly interacting limit . in particular ,",
    "a quasi-1d quantum gas of strongly interacting bosons has been observed in the so - called tonks - girardeau ( tg ) regime @xcite .",
    "these experiment progresses inspire great interest in exploring the properties of bosonic gases in the full interaction regime .    as is well known , the gross - pitaviskii ( gp ) theory is widely adopted in dealing with the system of bose - einstein condensations with weak interaction . in spite of its great success in explaining the basic experimental observations , the gp equation is fundamentally based on a mean - field approximation and fails in the strongly correlated systems kolomeisky , chen . for arbitrary interaction from weakly to",
    "strongly interacting limit , there exist several theoretical treatments including analytic method , e.g. bethe ansatz @xcite , and numerical simulation e.g. the exact diagonalization deuretzbacher , hao08 , the multi - configuration time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) method @xcite , discrete variable representation ( dvr ) @xcite , and so on .",
    "bethe ansatz provides the exact solution to some many - body systems including bose gas @xcite , fermi gas yang , hao2 , bose - fermi mixture @xcite as well as multi - component cases . in the past several years , though it has made great development in cooperation with other theories and some numerical methods , this analytical method mainly solves the uniform system . on the other hand , numerical techniques",
    "provide more information about the many - body system , for example , mctdh method can not only reveal the ground state property , but also tackle its dynamics @xcite . for finite particle interactions",
    "no analytical solution to the two - particle problem is known for a finite split barrier in the center .",
    "dvr has been used to achieve the discretization of the spatial coordinates for two particles , however , the generalization to more particles are not straightforward @xcite .    while most theoretical works assume large particle numbers , strongly correlated atomic systems realized in current experiments are limited to systems with a small number of particles @xcite .",
    "the exact diagonalization method becomes more and more versatile and powerful in dealing with the ground state problem of such few - body  system .",
    "in this paper , we study the ground state properties of a few spinless bosons which are confined in a 1d hard - wall trap and interact via repulsive contact potential .",
    "in addition we add a @xmath2-split in the center of the trap potential which may be viewed as a generic model for double well structure or , alternatively , as a good approximation to the problem of a trap with an impurity at the center .",
    "while the the optical box trap has been experimentally achieved @xcite , the @xmath2-split potential may be realized by adding an additional laser in the center of the box trap . by changing the strength of the laser",
    ", one can tune the height of the split barrier effectively . in order to get some exact results in the strongly coupling limit",
    ", we first investigate the system by fermi - bose mapping @xcite in the infinite repulsive limit in which the interactions between bosonic particles dominate the physics of the system .",
    "then we use the exact diagonalization method to deal with the situation in the full interaction regime .",
    "in particular , the reduced single particle density , momentum distribution and occupation of the natural orbits are illustrated by varying the parameters such as the number of particles , the strength of interaction between particles and the height of split barrier .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we describe the hamiltonian of the few - boson system and review the single particle eigenstates . in sec.iii ,",
    "the tg gas is studied and we will see how the properties of the ground state in this extreme limit reveal the implication of this few - boson system .",
    "subsequently sec.iv is devoted to the exact diaganolization method to deal with the variable interaction case .",
    "finally we summarize our result in sec.v .",
    "we consider @xmath3 bosonic atoms of mass @xmath4 confined in a highly elongated hard wall trap which can be treated as quasi - one dimensional . for the case study of localization of particles , we split the trap by inserting a tunable zero - ranged barrier at the trap center @xcite .",
    "the atoms interact via a delta potential and the hamiltonian for this system is ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 where the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath7 is given by@xmath8 here @xmath9 describes a hard wall trap which is zero in the region @xmath10 and infinite outside .",
    "the last term in the single - particle hamiltonian represents a @xmath2-type barrier located at the origin and we denote the strength of this barrier by a positive parameter @xmath11 . another essential parameter to characterize the system is the one - dimensional interaction strength @xmath12 which is determined by the modified @xmath13-wave scattering length due to the strong transverse confinement @xcite .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian can be exactly solved and the solution can be found in standard textbook and we review the result here again for later computation .    the eigen equation of single - particle hamiltonian is@xmath14 \\phi \\left ( x\\right ) = e\\phi \\left ( x\\right )",
    ".   \\label{eigeneq}\\]]the eigenfunctions are either symmetric or antisymmetric .",
    "the analytic symmetric eigenfunctions are@xmath15 , -a\\leq x\\leq 0 \\\\ c [ \\cos \\left ( px\\right ) + \\frac{\\kappa } { p}\\sin \\left ( px\\right ) ] , 0\\leq x\\leq a\\end{array}\\right .",

    "the corresponding energy is @xmath19 .",
    "by contrast , the antisymmetric eigenfunctions are unaffected by the barrier and vanish at the origin .",
    "they are the same as the odd eigenstate of the hard wall trap without split ( @xmath20)@xmath21 , \\text { } n=1,3,5\\cdots   \\label{wavef2}\\]]the corresponding energies is determined by @xmath22 . in the limit @xmath23 , energies for symmetric states in unit of @xmath24 are @xmath25 , and those for the antisymmetric eigenstates are @xmath26 . in the opposite limit ,",
    "i.e. @xmath27 , the former energy series converge towards @xmath26 , and each symmetric eigenstate becomes degenerate with the next highest - lying antisymmetric state .",
    "the infinite interaction between the atoms can be represented as a constraint on the allowed bosonic wavefunction @xmath28.@xmath29which suggests that tg gas may be viewed as a group of free  bosons governed by the hamiltonian @xmath30 , while its wavefunction is subjected to the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ contrain ] ) .",
    "one can see immediately that this constraint is equivalent to the exclusive principle for a fermi system with antisymmetric wavefunctions .",
    "based on this observation girardeau girardeau found the bose - fermi mapping theorem that allows one to construct wavefunction for a tg gas from the wavefunction of a free fermi system . in particular , the wavefunction of the bosonic system @xmath31 is related to the non - interacting fermionic wavefunction @xmath32 by the mapping @xmath33the fermionic wavefunction can be constructed from slater determinant @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the single particle wavefunctions obtained above . the antisymmetric function @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 with @xmath38 the sign function .",
    "the tg gas is exactly solvable in this way and one easily see that the single - particle density or the thermodynamic properties are identical for these two systems .",
    "however , quantum correlations considerably differ from each other as can be manifested in the reduced single - particle density ( rspd ) or the momentum distribution .",
    "although the exact many - body wave function describing tg gas can be written in compact form , it is a difficult task to calculate the rspd defined as@xmath39and the momentum distribution @xmath40which is normalized to one . to resolve the difficulty of multi - integration , pezer and buljan @xcite rewrote the rspd in terms of the single particle basis@xmath41the coefficients @xmath42 constitute an @xmath43 matrix @xmath44 and the entries of the matrix @xmath45 are @xmath46 , assuming @xmath47 without loss of generality .",
    "this scheme enables efficient and exact numerical calculation of quantum correlations in few body systems .    , ( b)@xmath48 , ( c)@xmath49 , ( d)@xmath50 .",

    "each plot spans the range @xmath51.,width=288 ]    we illustrate the rspd of 5 particles in fig . 1 and that of 6 particles in fig . 2 for four different barrier strengths @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the diagonal term @xmath53 is nothing but the single - particle density and is normalized to @xmath3 . for a negligibly small split barrier , fig.1 ( a ) and fig.2 ( a ) show that the diagonal line have @xmath3 peaks meaning @xmath3 density maxima , since the infinite interaction between particles repel each other to occupy different positions .",
    "meanwhile the off - diagonal elements are non - zero , which reflect the correlation between particles .",
    "physically this self correlation @xmath54 can be viewed as the probability that two successive measurements will find the particles at position @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "increasing the barrier strength , as seen in fig.1 ( b - d ) and fig.2 ( b - d ) , leads to the emergence of a quadrant separation which coincides with the result of ref .",
    "we note also in this system there appears an interesting parity effect for odd and even number of particles .",
    "when @xmath3 is odd , the middle peak begins to split into two with increasing barrier strength , so the number of density peaks in each well increases from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath3 is even , on the other hand , there are always @xmath59 peaks in each well for any value of barrier height . for a very strong split in the center , e.g. @xmath60 ,",
    "the off - diagonal quadrants diminish for @xmath61 is even , while remain nonzero for @xmath3 is odd .",
    "this implies that for odd number of particles , the correlation between the two sides of the split persists for a rather high barrier .",
    "we can explain our result in a way similar to the energy band theory .",
    "the barrier in our system splits the hard wall trap into a double - well structure .",
    "just as the extension of two - site hubbard model to a lattice gives naturally the energy band , one can imagine that the hard wall trap with periodically distributed @xmath0splits , i.e. , kronig - penny potential , admits also similar band structure @xcite .",
    "each band in our system , however , consists of only two energy levels .",
    "the infinite interaction between particles forbids particles to occupy the same level and only two particles are allowed to populate in each energy band . for the ground state ,",
    "particles occupy the energy levels from the bottom one by one .",
    "when @xmath3 is even , all occupied energy bands are full and the system is in an insulator state , while for @xmath3 is odd , the highest occupied band is half filled which reminds us the conduction band in metal conductor .",
    "particles occupying that band can move more freely which is the reason for  different off - diagonal elements of rspd induced by the parity of particle number .    these results can also be understood in a simpler way .",
    "when @xmath3 is even , each well can keep @xmath59 particles , and the chemical potential can keep balance in two sides of middle barrier .",
    "when @xmath3 is odd , supposed  each well is firstly filled with @xmath57 particles , one would face a dilemma on how to put the last one .",
    "the probability of finding the last particle is the same in each well , which keeps the connection between the two wells and leads to non - zero rspd in off - diagonal quadrant .    to characterize some bec - like coherence effects in few body system ,",
    "one usually examine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the rspd girardeau2 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the rspd , called the natural orbits @xmath62 in tg systems @xmath63represent a set of effective single - particle states , while eigenvalues @xmath64 represent their occupation and @xmath65 .",
    "the momentum distribution is related to these natural orbits via the relation @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes the fourier transformation of @xmath68 @xmath69    , of 5 particles ( a ) and 6 particles ( b ) in tg limit for @xmath70 when the number of particles is odd , the secondary peaks appear for increased barrier strength due to the interference of particle in two almost separate wells , while for even , the momentum distribution broaden for increased barrier strength owing to the localization of particles in separate halves of the trap.,width=336 ]    fig.3 shows the momentum distribution in the tg  limit for four different values of the barrier strength @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath3 is odd , as the barrier strength is increased , the main peak firstly increases , reaches the critical value for a barrier strength , and then begins to decrease thereafter . _ _  _ _ the secondary peaks appear with increasing strength of barrier .",
    "the barrier separates the particles into two half wells , which , however , are not independent but interfere with each other .",
    "it is this interference that leads to the appearance of the secondary peaks .",
    "when the number of particles increase , the secondary peaks become more and more slight as a result of infinite interaction between particles .",
    "when @xmath3 is even , the momentum distribution becomes broader and broader with increasing barrier strength and the height of peak decreases monotonically , which coincides with earlier observation that @xmath59 particles become localized in each separate half - well and keep balance in the two sides of barrier .     of 5 particles ( a ) and 6 particles ( b ) in tg limit for @xmath70 when the number of particles is odd , with the increased barrier strength ,",
    "the two largest occupations do not change almost while the other nearby two occupations have the same value which form pairs .",
    "when @xmath3 is even , with the increased barrier strength , all nearby two occupations have the same value which also form pairs.,width=336 ]    we also present the occupation of the natural orbits for odd and even particles in fig.4 . clearly the presence of the split in the center will not affect the occupation obviously for odd number of particles .",
    "the first and second occupancies remain the same for increasing barrier height , but the third and fourth occupancies tend to form the staircase structure , implying the formation of pairs .",
    "subsequently , the next two occupancies also form pairs , and so on .",
    "contrary to this , for even number of particles , all occupations tend to form pairs with increasing barrier strength due to the degeneracy of energy levels , which is also observed in fermionic tg gas girardeau3 . in the case of odd number of particles ,",
    "the presence of the last particle  prevents the formation of pairs in the the first and second occupations .",
    "for finite particle interaction , we use exact diagonalization method deuretzbacher to deal with the many body hamiltonian ( [ hamltion1 ] ) , which takes the second quantized form@xmath71where @xmath72 is the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator for a particle in the single particle energy eigenstate @xmath73 . the interaction integration parameters @xmath74 are calculated through @xmath75 .",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalized in the subspace of the energetically lowest eigenstates of non - interaction many - particle system .",
    "some exact results for a pair of bosons have been obtained in ref . @xcite and our calcualtion for even number of particles implies similar behaviours in the relevant physical quantities .",
    "we will concentrate on the results for odd number of bosons @xmath76 considering 26 single particle eigenstates in the following .     and different interaction strength @xmath77 .",
    "the density becomes flatter and broader with increasing @xmath12 . in the strong interaction regime",
    "new peaks appear gradually and finally the density tends to be the same as that of 5 free fermions.,width=336 ]    let s first discuss the particle density , @xmath78 where the mean value is calculated on the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ sechamilt ] ) . without loss of generality , we choose the barrier strength @xmath79 .",
    "fig.5 shows the particle density for variable interaction strength @xmath77 . because of the presence of the central barrier , the density in the middle position appears to be lower than its nearby region . for noninteracting bosons",
    ", there is one peak on either side of the barrier respectively . as the interaction strength",
    "is increased , the particle density begins to spread out and becomes flatter , while the height of two peaks is decreased .",
    "new small peaks appear for certain interaction and finally the density tends to be the same as that for free fermion system .    .",
    "the secondary peaks disappear with increasing interaction strength which hinders the interference of the particles in two separate half - wells.,width=336 ]    the momentum distribution for finite interaction is now calculated as @xmath80 and is normalized to one . here",
    "@xmath81 annihilates a boson with momentum @xmath82 and can be expanded upon the fourier transformation of single particle eigenstates @xmath83 .",
    "fig.6 shows the momentum distribution for the same values of interaction strength as in fig.5 .",
    "we find , as the interaction is increased , the secondary peaks disappear gradually and the central peak becomes lower and broader .",
    "this result proves that the interaction will diminish the interference between two wells .",
    "the momentum distribution is identical for @xmath84 and tg limit @xmath85 which is calculated by the fermi - bose mapping in the above section . in the tg case",
    ", the long tail appears because the higher energy levels may been occupied by some particles owing to the infinity repel interaction , which agrees with general nature of a tg gas .",
    "this is in strike contrast with the main feature of momentum distribution for 5 free fermions which takes the plateau shape composed of 5 peaks and without the long tail .    .",
    "on each state in ( d ) , the left solid part represents @xmath84 and the right hollow part shows the tg case . with increasing @xmath12",
    "the bosons leave the ground state and occupy excited states . the occupation number in the lower state are always larger than that in the next higher state .",
    ", width=336 ]    we also present the result for occupation number distribution @xmath86 which is different from the occupation of natural orbits mentioned above .",
    "the occupied states here are single particle wavefunctions in the trap , while natural orbits are eigenfunctions of the rspdm . as can be seen in fig.7 , with increasing @xmath12 , the bosons occupy not only the ground state but also some low - lying excited states .",
    "the occupation number in the lower state are always larger than that in the next higher one , which is different with particles in the harmonic trap @xcite . in the harmonic trap ,",
    "single - particle states with even parity are stronger occupied compared to those with odd parity .",
    "the difference between our double well and single well structure comes from the fact that odd parity states can never feel the existence of the split in the center . in fig.7 ( d )",
    "we compare these two kinds of occupations of single particle states and natural orbits and find that they almost have the same value in the corresponding state though the details are not completely identical .",

    "secondary peaks appear with increasing barrier strength , while disappear for increasing interaction strength.,width=336 ]    the last knob to control the system is the variable barrier strength of the split .",
    "fig.8 shows the particle density distribution for four inter - particle interaction strengths @xmath92 and four values of barrier strengths @xmath52 . as the barrier strength",
    "is increased , the density in middle area is decreasing while the density in other area is increasing for any interaction .",
    "the barrier therefore divides the particles into two areas regardless of the interaction .",
    "it is more constructive to say more words on the secondary peaks in the momentum distribution , which has already been shown in fig.6 .",
    "physically , the interference between particles split into the two separate half - wells gives rise to these peaks , which reminds us the famous double - slit arrangement .",
    "fig.9 ( a ) shows the momentum distribution of 5 non - interacting particles ( @xmath93 ) for varying @xmath11 . in this case the momentum distribution is given by the square of the single - particle wave - function in momentum space .",
    "so we can write it out analytically@xmath94with @xmath16 is a normalization factor .",
    "the secondary peaks can be seen more and more clearly with increasing strength of barrier .",
    "strength of the barrier causes the spreading of the particle - density in two wells , which in turn leads to a narrowing of momentum peaks . for finite interaction strength , fig.9 ( b - d ) show similar tendency for the central and secondary peaks .",
    "the disappearance of the secondary peaks with increasing interaction strength can be attributed to the increased localization of the particles , analogous to the superfluid - insulator transition of the bose - hubbard model in optical lattice studies @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the ground state property of few bosons in a hard wall trap with @xmath0type split in the center .",
    "based on the fermi - bose mapping , the reduced single - particle density and the momentum distribution of odd @xmath95 and even @xmath96 bosons are illustrated and explained in tg limit .",
    "the off - diagonal quadrants representing the interference between two half wells remain nonzero for @xmath3 is odd , while disappear for @xmath3 is even . for finite interaction strength ,",
