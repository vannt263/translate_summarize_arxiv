    "@xcite , is used to denote the repulsive force that mediates at very small inter - membrane distances .",
    "the underlying mechanisms of hydration forces are still under active research @xcite  it suffices to simply indicate here that they are quite short ranged and drop off exponentially with distance .",
    "helfrich , in a pioneering work @xcite , showed that two fluctuating fluid membranes exert a repulsive force on each other .",
    "biomembranes are generally quite flexible and a single membrane fluctuates both freely and appreciably at physiological temperatures . as two membranes approach each other , they _ hinder _ or diminish each others out - of - plane fluctuations .",
    "this hindrance decreases the entropy and the ensuing overall increase of the free - energy of the membrane system , which depends on the inter - membrane distance , leads to a repulsive force that tends to push the membranes apart .",
    "helfrich @xcite , using a variety of physical arguments and approximations , postulated that the entropic force varies as @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to the other known repulsive forces , this behavior is long - ranged and competes with the van der waals attraction at all distances @xcite . since helfrich s proposal @xcite",
    ", biophysicists have used the existence of this repulsive force to explain and understand a variety of phenomena related to membrane interactions .",

    "freund controversially finds that within a range of @xmath0 values the force law between two fluctuating membranes is proportional to @xmath5 rather than the well - accepted result of helfrich : @xmath3 . to settle this issue ,",
    "we have reexamined this problem both analytically and through recourse to carefully conducted monte carlo simulations .",
    "as was initially pointed out by helfrich @xcite , due to reflective symmetry , the evaluation of the force between two membranes in a periodic stack may be replaced by a single membrane confined between two rigid walls ( figure 1 ) . throughout this article",

    "then from the definition @xcite the partition function of the system can be written as a functional integral : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is any differentiable function interpolating the discrete molecules deviation @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the point - wise hindrance condition that @xmath25 is enforced throughout this work .",
    "this constraint is in fact the key obstacle in the closed - form evaluation of the partition function .",
    "freund @xcite modified the partition function by introducing adjustable integration limits , and then minimized the resultant free energy with respect to these limits to determine the change in free energy with respect to inter membrane separation ( and hence the entropic force law ) . in the conclusions section ,",
    "we discuss freund s approach further . here",
    ", we adopt the form of the partition function in eq.([eqn:2 ] ) which , notwithstanding the analytical intractability of its integration limits ( i.e. pointwise constraint on @xmath26 ) , is _ exact _ within the present formulation .",
    "we remark here that helfrich @xcite avoids the point - wise @xmath27 condition , @xmath28 , and instead imposes a weaker constraint where the mean square membrane displacement is required to be bounded by @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 .    to gain new insights into the partition function , two dimensionless quantities , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are introduced as @xmath33 by changes of variables we may rewrite the partition function as ( @xmath34 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath35 ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",

    "janke and kleinert @xcite have performed monte carlo calculations and found that @xmath45 is a constant in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the value of this constant was also found by kleinert using a variational approach @xcite .",
    "we remark that in the past works that have performed monte carlo calculations of this problem , the veracity of the helfrich s pressure law has been implicitly embraced and the focus has not been on examining the dependence of the entropic pressure on inter membrane distance but rather calculation of @xmath45 _ assuming _ that helfrich s inverse cube law is correct .",
    "this is the reason , we believe , that freund s result and ( now ours ) has not been noted until now .    as evident from the definition in eq.([eqn:8 ] ) , @xmath46 is a function of the separation between the rigid walls confining the membrane .",
    "it is interesting to consider the energy variation , and consequently the pressure , at some small distances . as freund has shown , this limit is analytically tractable .",

    "another interesting point obtained from eq.([eqn:16 ] ) is that the first term in the right - hand side has the form of pressure of the ideal gas .",
    "physically , this implies that the membrane fluctuates similar to an ideal gas in the limit @xmath71 , with a correction term which is in the order of @xmath83 ( the second term in eq.([eqn:16 ] ) ) .",
    "this ideal - gas contribution does not depend on the bending modulus @xmath84 , hence every type of membranes should exhibit the @xmath85 pressure law at the limit @xmath71 .    in order to elucidate the full @xmath82dependence including the limit @xmath71 , a natural step is to take recourse in numerical monte carlo simulations which are discussed in the next section .",
