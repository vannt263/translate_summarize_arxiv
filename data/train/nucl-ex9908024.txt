    "for reactions with two incoming spin 1/2 particles one can define the initial state cross sections @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the combined spin of the two particles and @xmath10 its projection .",

    "1 - 6 @xmath31 theoretical models for pion production near threshold can thus be tested in an unprecedented manner using measurements of spin observables of the reaction @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the results for the spin - correlation coefficient combinations @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( the latter equivalent to @xmath34 ) and the analyzing power , @xmath35 , which only needed transverse beam and target polarization , were published recently@xcite and the publication of the the data from the experiment using also longitudinal polarization components is in progress@xcite .",
    "the simultaneous measurements of spin correlation coefficients in @xmath36 will further enhance the usefulness of this experiment for resolving the theoretical issues of @xmath37 reactions@xcite .",
    "section 2 contains a brief description of the experimental method which is described in detail elsewhere@xcite . in section 3",
    "we discuss the preliminary results of the measurements using polarized beam with longitudinal components , and the possible implications .",
    "the vertically polarized beam was injected into the iucf cooler ring at 197 mev and then accelerated to 325 , 350 , 375 or 400 mev .",
    "the longitudinal component of the beam polarization was achieved using one superconducting solenoid and the three existing solenoids in the cooling section operated in a non - compensating mode . at the injection energy the polarization at the target was almost entirely longitudinal but",
    "since the solenoid fields remained constant , after acceleration only partially longitudinal beam polarization could be achieved .",
    "the major components were along and vertical to the beam momentum and one minor component was sideways .",
    "the beam spin direction was reversed at each new injection .",
    "the target was polarized atomic hydrogen in a gas storage cell fed by an atomic beam source@xcite .",
    "the target thickness was of the order of @xmath38 atoms@xmath39 .",
    "the spin direction was changed every two seconds , along the @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 axes , by switching weak guide fields ( @xmath43 mt ) , supplied by helmholtz - like coils external to the target chamber .",

    "[ fig : mx ] the @xmath45 distribution is shown for the data set with longitudinal and transverse beam spin components summed over all spin states at a beam energy of 325 mev .",
    "the shape of the background in the spectrum was well reproduced by data taken with nitrogen gas instead of hydrogen in the target .",
    "full coverage of phase space was achieved with the exception of the loss of events when protons go undetected into the beampipe , i.e. @xmath46 of phase space distributed events were lost at 325 - 400 mev . in an investigation of systematic errors",
    "the spin observables were studied as a function of an artificial @xmath47 cut - off using an effective - range expansion for the @xmath48 final state interaction@xcite .",
    "the corrections applied for the relative spin - dependent cross sections were less than the statistical errors .",
    "the cross - ratio method@xcite which eliminates asymmetries due to detector acceptance and spin - dependent luminosities , and division by the product where @xmath49 is the ratio of the yields , @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the product of the beam and target polarization . ] of the beam and target polarization projections , @xmath52 or @xmath53 , give @xmath54 and @xmath55 from the spinsorted and backgroundsubtracted yields of the @xmath56 .",
    "the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are obtained . by detecting @xmath48 elastic scattering at @xmath57 simultaneously with the pion production and measuring the @xmath48 spin correlation coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 which are large and known with high precision at this angle@xcite .",

    "previous comparison with data yielded qualitative agreement for @xmath62 and @xmath35 , but disagreed completely with the data on @xmath58@xcite .",
    "[ fig : sms ] indicates that @xmath63 , the initial state cross section contributing only to pp final states , contains the amplitudes quantitavely best reproduced by theory so far .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the energy dependence assumed for the ps and pp partial waves , i.e. the proportionality to @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively , is valid for the measured energy range .",
    "the magnitude of the ps cross section is calculated using equ .",
    "7 , it increases from about 18% to 30% for bombarding energies in the range from 325 to 400 mev . at 310 mev",
    "there are recent reports of a significant ps contribution to the total cross section@xcite and an sd - ss interference of a few percent@xcite , measuring unpolarized angular distributions .",
    "we conclude that it should be of high priority to proceed with the study of the main inelastic channel in @xmath66 interactions , both experimentally by means of high statistics experiments that allow the extraction of angular distributions of spin - dependent observables , and theoretically by extending the many existing models concerning the ss contribution to the total cross section to also include higher partial waves .",
