    "understanding the relationship between the distribution of dark matter and the distribution of visible galaxies is one of the central problems of modern cosmology . theoretically , the problem of calculating the statistical properties of the mass distribution in a given cosmological model ( and here we will consider only hierarchical clustering models ) consists primarily of understanding the gravitational dynamics of collisionless dark matter , as the baryonic component contributes only a small fraction of the total mass density .",
    "the gravitational evolution of dark matter universes has been extensively investigated using n - body simulations ( for a review see frenk 1991 ) and analytic approximations such as the press & schechter ( 1974 ) formalism and its extensions ( bower 1992 , bond _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) or second order perturbation theory ( bouchet _ et al . _  ( 1992 ) , bernardeau ( 1994 ) ) .    with the exception of gravitational lensing studies ,",
    "a subject still in its infancy , the only information we have on the properties of the underlying mass field , comes indirectly through studies of the baryonic component of the universe , primarily galaxies , but also x - ray emitting gas in clusters and groups .",
    "our lack of understanding of how the properties of the matter we can observe are related to the properties of the underlying mass field is a major obstacle in assessing the validity of theoretical models of structure formation . with the simplest possible assumption ,",
    "that light traces mass ( at least above some scale larger than that of galaxies where baryons dominate ) , hierarchical clustering theories do lead to model universes which superficially resemble are own .",
    "there are , however , many disagreements of detail with observations and there is much debate on how to remove these either by a suitable choice of cosmological parameters , by varying the assumptions about the nature of the dark matter or by arguing that the observed baryons are biased tracers of the mass .",
    "a way out of this impasse is to try and predict the behaviour of baryonic matter from first principles .",
    "unfortunately , the dissipative physics that govern the evolution of gas and the formation of stars makes this an exceedingly complex problem .",
    "one approach is to describe the behaviour of baryons within a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos using simple rules based on analytic or heuristic considerations .",
    "such semianalytic modelling has proved quite successful in explaining some of the observed properties of galaxies ( _ e.g. _ white and frenk 1991 ; kauffman _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; cole _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) . the more direct approach , which is allied to n - body simulations of the dark matter , is to try and calculate numerically the hydrodynamic evolution of baryons , using heuristic rules for describing processes associated with star formation .",
    "this approach requires formidable computing power which is only now becoming available ( cen & ostriker 1996 , katz _",
    "_ 1992 , evrard , summers and davis 1994 , frenk _ et al . _",
    "1996 )    the virgo consortium was formed with the aim of exploting the latest generation of parallel supercomputers in order to address the problem of calculating the coupled evolution of dark matter and gas in the expanding universe .",
    "this kind of work represents a relatively new frontier where the very choice of numerical techniques and input physics is still very much an issue .",
    "ultimately , it may prove possible to make reliable and testable predictions of , for example , the abundance and clustering pattern of galaxies expected in specific cosmologies . here",
    "we give a short progress report on our programme . in section 2",
    "we provide a very brief description of our numerical code and its current input physics . in section 3",
    "we discuss results from large n - body simulations which reveal the kind of relationship required between the clustering of galaxies and dark matter in a selection of popular cosmological models . in section 4",
    "we present preliminary results of two large n - body / gasdynamic simulations which begin to address the extent to which these requirements are met in practice .",
    "this work is ongoing and we refrain from drawing any strong conclusions at present .",
    "our current working code is based on `` hydra , '' a code developed by couchman , thomas and pearce ( 1995 ) and parallelized by pearce",
    "_ et al . _",
    "gravity is treated using the adaptive @xmath4  technique and gas dynamics are treated using `` smooth particle hydrodynamics''(sph ) . the smallest mesh refinements , placed on the regions of strongest clustering , are farmed out to individual processors .",
    "larger refinements and the base level grid are run in parallel across all the processors . for a typical dark matter",
    "only run with @xmath0 particles , we use a @xmath5 grid as the base mesh and the code is run on 256 processors .",
    "although our code can treat the effects of a photoionizing background and , through a simple heuristic model , the effects of star formation and feedback , the gas simulations described below follow only the evolution of gas subject to radiative cooling and shocks .",
    "all our simulations have been carried out on cray - t3ds at the edinburgh parallel supercomputer centre and at the max - planck rechen zentrum in garching .",
    "we have carried out a set of very large n - body simulations of cold dark matter universes with four different choices of cosmological parameters . with the exception of a @xmath6 particle open model ,",
    "each simulation followed the evolution of @xmath0 particles in a computational box of @xmath7 on side .",
    "( here and below @xmath8 denotes hubble s constant in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) .",
    "the gravitational softening was typically @xmath9 . in all cases ,",
    "the initial fluctuation amplitude was set by requiring that the model should reproduce the observed abundance of rich clusters at the present day .",
    "this was accomplished by setting , @xmath10 , the present day linear rms fluctuation on spheres of radius @xmath11 , to the values recommended by white , efstathiou & frenk ( 1993 ) and eke , cole & frenk ( 1996 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows mass autocorrelation functions , @xmath12 , at several epochs in all four simulations .",
    "proceeding anticlockwise from the top left panel , the models plotted are : `` standard '' cdm ( scdm with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) ; `` lambda '' cdm ( @xmath16  with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) ; `` open '' cdm ( ocdm  with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) ; and `` tau '' cdm ( @xmath24  with @xmath25 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the same power spectrum shape as @xmath16  and ocdm ) . because of the high resolution and large volume of these simulations the autocorrelation function is reliably determined over a large range of scales . the shape of @xmath12 is broadly similar in all the models : it is relatively shallow on small scales , becomes increasingly steep and has an inflection point at @xmath26 .",
    "the scdm case shows the steepest drop at pair separations @xmath27 .",
    "also plotted in figure  1 are estimates of the autocorrelation function of galaxies as inferred by baugh ( 1996 ) from the angular correlation function of the apm galaxy survey ( maddox _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) and a model for the evolution of @xmath28 .",
    "the solid curve with error bars shows the estimate assuming no evolution of clustering in comoving coordinates while the dotted curve shows the estimate assuming linear evolution of clustering on all scales .",
    "( the statistical errors are similar in both cases ) . except in the ocdm  case",
    ", @xmath12 always falls below the galaxy data on very small scales . in the two @xmath13 models",
    ", the mass correlation function matches the galaxy data out to pair separations @xmath29 and then falls below them . in the low @xmath3 cases , on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath12 rises above the galaxy data out to pair separations of a few @xmath30 and then closely follows @xmath28 before falling slightly below it at the largest pair separations .",
    "the lower box in each panel shows the square root of the ratio of the galaxy correlation function to the mass correlation function .",
    "this is the bias in the galaxy distribution that would be required for each model to match the observed strength of galaxy clustering . in all cases ,",
    "the bias function is scale dependent . in the @xmath13 models ,",
    "it is approximately unity at small and intermediate pair separation before rising steeply at large separations ( particularly for the scdm model ) . in our low @xmath3 models",
    ", the bias falls below unity over a large range of pair separations indicating the need for a substantial negative bias or antibias .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that for the models under discussion to be viable a non - trivial relationship must exist between the distributions of galaxies and mass .",
    "these dark matter only simulations can not be used to decide if such biases are plausible since this requires modelling the process of galaxy formation . in the next section",
    "we discuss our first attempts to address this problem .",
    "we have carried out two n - body / sph simulations that follow the coupled evolution of gas and dark matter in the scdm and @xmath16  cosmologies discussed in the preceeding section .",
    "( because of a programming error the value of @xmath10 in the @xmath16  model was set to 1.4 instead of the desired value of 0.9 ) .",
    "each species is represented by 2 million particles .",
    "the gas is allowed to cool radiatively according to the cooling function for a fully ionized plasma with half - solar metallicity .",
    "experimentation shows that efficient cooling on galactic scales requires a gas particle mass of no more than @xmath31 .",
    "we adopt the value of the baryon density , @xmath32 , implied by nucleosynthesis considerations : @xmath33 ( copi _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . with this choice of parameters",
    "the computational volume is 100 mpc on a side in both models .",
    "the simulations start at redshift @xmath34 in the scdm model and @xmath35 in the @xmath16  model .",
    "structure in the dark matter builds up in the familiar hierarchical fashion .",
    "the gas is able to cool radiatively into the evolving population of dark matter halos .",
    "there it settles into cold knots of size comparable to the gravitational softening length , @xmath36 kpc .",
    "these cold knots we identify with `` galaxies . '' at the present epoch , the number of galaxies with more than 20 gas particles is 1200 for scdm and 1800 for @xmath16 . in figure  2",
    "we plot the baryonic mass function in the two models .",
    "the number densities decline at the low mass end due to resolution effects . above the resolution limit",
    ", the number densities fall off with mass approximately as a power law , with perhaps an indication of a high mass cutoff .",
    "one way to check whether these mass functions are correct , _ ie _ whether they are the expected outcome of the input physics , is to compare them with the results of the semianalytic models mentioned in section  1 .",
    "these can be tailored to include the same physics as the simulations , a mass resolution limit and gas subject only to shock heating and radiative cooling .",
    "the mass functions predicted by the appropriately modified version of the semianalytic model of cole",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) are plotted in figure  2 ( baugh , private communication ) . a mass resolution corresponding to",
    "20 sph particles has been assumed and results are shown for two gas metallicities , primordial ( dotted line ) and half - solar ( dashed line ) . at the low mass end , the semianalytic calculation predicts many more `` galaxies '' than formed in the simulations .",
    "this indicates that the effective mass resolution of the simulations is closer to 100 sph particle masses than to 20 .",
    "indeed , beyond about @xmath37 , the agreement between the numerical and semianalytic results is good , particularly in view of the fact that there are no adjustable parameters in this comparison . at the high mass end",
    "both simulations , but particularly the @xmath16  model , produce too many objects .",
    "these very massive `` galaxies '' occur predominantly in the cores of rich clusters .",
    "thus the simulations seem to suffer from an `` overmerging '' problem similar to that seen in the simulations of frenk _ et al . _",
    "this problem affects only a small fraction of the mass : the total amount of cold gas in the models and in the semianalytic models is very similar .",
    "autocorrelation functions for both galaxies and mass in our two simulations are shown in figure  3 .",
    "we split the galaxy samples into two halves , `` heavy '' and `` light '' galaxies with a cutoff mass of @xmath38 in the scdm model and @xmath39 in the @xmath16  model .",
    "apart from a moderate effect in the scdm case at separations @xmath40 , there is little mass segregation when the sample is split in this way .",
    "the galaxy correlation functions are compared with the mass correlation function in the `` bias '' plots shown in the lower part of each panel . in the scdm case",
    "the correlation functions of both heavy and light galaxies are positively biased relative to the mass on scales less than a few hundred @xmath41 and larger than about @xmath42 .",
    "by contrast , in the @xmath16  case , galaxies of both types are antibiased over most of the distance range considered but they closely trace the mass at separations @xmath43 .",
    "the observed galaxy correlation function , reproduced from figure  1 , is shown as a dotted line in figure  3 .",
    "( for clarity we plot only the `` no evolution '' estimate ) .",
    "although the various bias effects seen in the simulations seem to have the correct sign , they are , for the most part , weaker than required to account for the observations .",
    "we note , however , that our adopted value of @xmath10 in the @xmath16  model was erroneously set too high and this might well have weakened the biases present in this model .",
    "the weaker clustering of the galaxy distribution compared to the mass in the @xmath16  model is intriguing .",
    "this is the first time that such an effect has been seen in a cosmological simulation . a clue to its cause is provided by comparing the ( number weighted ) galaxy correlation function of figure  3 with the galaxy - mass weighted correlation function .",
    "this comparison is carried out in figure  4 and shows that the antibias is replaced by a positive bias when galaxies are weighted by their mass rather than equally .",
    "this suggests that the antibias present in the galaxy distribution is related to the merging and disruption of galaxies in rich clusters which produces very massive objects at their centres .",
    "we are currently carrying out a series of tests to examine this issue in detail .",
    "whilst the physics in our dark matter simulations are well understood and the results are reliable , the same can not yet be said of our dark matter plus gas simulations .",
    "we are continuing the analysis of these and related simulations in an effort to better understand the numerics and physics in a regime not previously explored .",
    "in particular , we stress that the galaxy correlation functions are very sensitive to the distribution of galaxies in the cores of rich clusters .",
    "the formation of excessively massive galaxies in these cores suggests that firm conclusions regarding biases in the galaxy distribution will have to await a better understanding of the processes at work in these extreme environments .",
