    "it is well known that the chaotic motions of hamiltonian dynamical systems exhibit slow dynamics , such as the polynomial decay of the time correlation function and the @xmath4 power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "these slow motions should be understood from the measure - theoretical viewpoint .",
    "however , the mixed phase space , which consists of integrable ( torus ) and non - integrable ( chaos ) components , makes it difficult to study the ergodic properties , despite the fact that the liouville measure is invariant under the hamiltonian flow .",
    "stagnant motions near the invariant tori add to the difficulty because of the appearance of non - stationary processes such as arnold diffusion . the stagnant layer theory based on the nekhoroshev theorem",
    "has succeeded in explaining the scaling laws  @xcite , the induction phenomena in the lattice vibration  @xcite and the appearance of the log - weibull distribution in @xmath5-body systems  @xcite .",
    "intermittency is another area that typically exhibits slow dynamics .",
    "recently , the theory of intermittency has been developed using infinite ergodic theory , where the indifferent fixed points play an essential role in inducing the infinite measure and generating the non - stationary processes  @xcite .",
    "the darling - kac - aaronson theorem states that the rescaled time average of an @xmath6 observable function behaves essentially as the mittag - leffler ( ml ) random variable in the non - stationary dynamical processes ; the lempel - ziv complexity , which is a quantity of symbolic data in information theory , is also the ml random variable  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for some classes of observable functions , the rescaled time average behaves as a random variable that is related to the ml random variable  @xcite .",
    "if there exists stationary processes in the theory of intermittency , the time average converges to the phase average , as the birkhoff ergodic theorem describes .",
    "however , the central limit theorem , which is usually regarded as a distributional law in stationary processes , can be violated : anomalous fluctuations around the mean value and slow distributional convergence can appear . thus far , using renewal theory , large deviation theory and the semi - markovian approximation , these anomalous behaviors have been understood  @xcite .    in 2009 ,",
    "the polynomial decay of the large deviations for some observables was proved  @xcite and also shown numerically  @xcite in slowly mixing dynamical systems .",
    "however , the distributional law has not yet been explained completely from the viewpoint of ergodic theory .",
    "one of our objectives is to obtain numerical results of the distributional law of such anomalous fluctuations in order to develop the ergodic theory of the slow dynamics in the future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we introduce a class of one - dimensional intermittent maps equipped with a uniform invariant measure , motivated by the pikovsky map  @xcite and the miyaguchi map  @xcite , and we analyse the statistical aspects . in section  3",
