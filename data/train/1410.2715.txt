    "amno@xmath1-type ( a = alkaline or rare - earth metal ) manganese oxides with perovskite structure attracted considerable attention primarily due to the observed colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) behavior .",
    "@xcite apart from cmr oxides , a wide variety of mn - based ceramics exist in nature with complex crystallographic structure .",
    "actually , the perovskite based manganites belong to a wider class of materials with general formula a@xmath4mn@xmath5o@xmath6 , known as ruddlesden - popper phase ( rp ) . the @xmath7 = 3 compound is reported to form with a = ca with usual rp structure ,  @xcite which can be considered to have staking of trilayers made out of mno@xmath8 octahedra along the crystallographic @xmath9 axis . however , the sr and ba counterparts , namely sr@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 and ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 respectively  @xcite do not crystallize in a tri - layered structure . for them",
    "the crystal structure can be visualized as being built up from mn@xmath1o@xmath3 trimers of face sharing octahedra .",
    "@xcite these mn@xmath1o@xmath3 trimers form two dimensional layers perpendicular to the @xmath10 axis of the crystal .",
    "the layers are separated from each other by ba / sr cations .",
    "considering such coordination of mn atoms in these compounds , it is expected that the magnetism can be quite fascinating with primarily three kinds of magnetic interactions : ( i)intra - trimer , which operates between the mn@xmath11 ions within a single mn@xmath1o@xmath3 polyhedron ; ( ii ) intra - layer , which is the magnetic interaction constrained in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) layer ; and ( iii ) finally the inter - layer interaction which can lead to a three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetic ordering .",
    "magnetic studies indicate that both ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 and sr@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 undergo long range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering below the nel temperature ( @xmath12 ) close to 80 k.  @xcite however , precursor to the afm ordering , both the samples show a broad hump like feature in the magnetization ( @xmath13 ) versus temperature ( @xmath14 ) data .",
    "neutron data rule out the existence of any long range magnetic order associated with the hump like feature .",
    "@xcite , however , long range magnetic order is quite clearly visible in the neutron data recorded at 5 k in bmo .",
    "the prominent hump - like feature in the @xmath15 data indicates that some sort of short range magnetic correlation is prevailing in the sample prior to the long range order .",
    "tang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite fitted the hump like feature to bonner - fisher model and obtained the spin - spin coupling parameter to be @xmath16= 200 k for sr@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "however , their fitting to the susceptibility data is not satisfactory and they obtained an effective magnetic moment ( 6.4 @xmath17/mn ) which is much larger than the expected moment for @xmath18 = 3/2 state ( 3.87 @xmath17/mn ) .",
    "in addition , bonner - fisher model is supposed to be applicable to linear chain systems only ,  @xcite whereas the present composition has magnetic correlation constrained in a plane .",
    "there is so far no report on the analysis of high-@xmath14 hump in case of ba - counterpart .",
    "it appears that the exact magnetic characterizations of ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 and sr@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 compounds are lacking in the literature .",
    "considering this , we performed a comprehensive investigation on ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bmo ) and as well as on sr@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( smo ) .",
    "our results indicate the existence of 2d magnetic correlation in the samples which is likely to be associated with the layered structure of the compositions .",
    "polycrystalline samples of bmo and smo were prepared following solid state reaction route in air .",
    "stoichiometric mixture of baco@xmath1/srco@xmath1 and mno@xmath19 were initially heated at @xmath20 c for 48 h. the final sintering was performed at 1350@xmath21 c for 3 days in pelletized form and then quenched to room temperature .",

    "the orthorhombic lattice parameters ( @xmath24 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 ) are all found to be slightly lower in case of smo than bmo ( table i ) .",

    "a thermally activated rise in @xmath37 is noted with the increase of temperature above 150 k in case of bmo and above 200 k for smo .",

    "the magnetic susceptibility of a low dimensional oxide is often expressed as @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a temperature independent term arising primarily from van - vleck paramagnetism and core diamagnetism of the sample ; @xmath46 is due to free paramagnetic impurity spins which are not in the regular lattice site ; and @xmath47 is the term arising from spin - spin correlation in a low - d ( d @xmath48 3 ) network with @xmath16 and @xmath49 are being the heisenberg exchange integral and land-@xmath49 factor respectively . for the present work we have assumed @xmath49 = 1.9 .",

    "the overall fitting by bf model is very poor ( fitting for bmo is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4 ( a ) ) and it can not reproduce the peak value of the experimental @xmath27 data .",

    "considering trimerized mn@xmath1o@xmath3 building blocks of the compounds , we have analyzed the data with isolated linear spin - trimer model . from the theoretical point of view this model is applicable for isolated 3-spin system where spin quantum number is large ( @xmath62 3/2 ) .",
    "@xcite the hamiltonian for a isolated 3-spin blocks in presence of an external magnetic field @xmath63 can be written as : @xmath64    here @xmath65 represents the @xmath66 spin in the trimer ; and @xmath67 is the intra - trimer nearest neighbour spin - spin exchange term .",

    "[ chi ] , we failed to fit the experimental data for any physically acceptable values of @xmath67 for both bmo and smo .",
    "the fitted curve using @xmath74 is characteristically different from our experimental data , which shows a monotonic increase with lowering of @xmath14 without the signature of any hump ( see the inset of fig .",
    "4 ( a ) ) . therefore , the magnetic interaction within the mn@xmath1o@xmath3 polyhedra can not be high enough to produce spin - trimerized state which can be held responsible for the hump like feature in the susceptibility .",
    "we next tried to improve the model by introducing inter - trimer interaction through mean field approximation . considering an average field @xmath75 experienced by the trimers due to mutual interaction ,",
    "the mean field model predicts @xmath76 .",
    "however , incorporation of such mean field term does not improve the fitting with respect to the experimental data .",
    "it is apparent from the crystal structure that bmo and smo contain corrugated layers of mn@xmath58 ions in the @xmath77 plane of the lattice .",
    "the mn - mn distance on the layer is much smaller than the mn - mn distance between two layers .",
    "in addition , the layers are separated from each other by non - magnetic ba@xmath78 or sr@xmath78 ions while mn ions on a particular layer are connected via o@xmath79 ions , which can mediate superexchange .",
    "the system can have strong mn - mn interaction within the corrugated layer thereby paving the path for 2d magnetism .",
    "the failure of the spin - trimer model also advocates that the broad hump may be a signature of 2d magnetic correlation within the mn layer .    for 2d heisenberg spin system , at a sufficiently high temperature ( @xmath80 0.7 )",
    ", the magnetic susceptibility can be expressed as a series expansion in terms of @xmath81 , where @xmath26 is the nearest neighbor spin spin interaction within the layer .",
    "for the studied compounds , we consider a square planar 2d lattice within the layer with the number of nearest neighbours @xmath82 = 4 .",
    "the magnetic interaction is expressed in terms of an isotropic @xmath18 = 3/2 afm heisenberg model with the hamiltonian : @xmath83 , where the summation runs over all pair of nearest neighbour spins .",
    "@xcite considering high-@xmath14 series expansion  @xcite up to sixth order term , the spin susceptibility can be expressed as    @xmath84    here @xmath85 for @xmath18 = 3/2 , and the values of @xmath86 are 4.0 ,  1.6 ,  0.304 ,  0.249 ,  0.132 and 0.013 respectively .",
    "we have tried to fit the experimental susceptibility between temperature 100@xmath87320 k by incorporating the above expression of @xmath88 for @xmath47 in eqn .",
    "[ chi ] . for bmo and smo ,",
    "the best fittings for this 2d high temperature series expansion model are obtained for @xmath8945 k and @xmath8747 k respectively . from fig .",
    "4 ( a ) and ( b ) it is evident that the fittings are reasonably good above 125 k. @xmath46 contribution is found to be quite small ( for example , @xmath51 = 0.039(1 ) emu.k.mol@xmath90 and @xmath52 = @xmath879.3(2 ) k for bmo ) and these value are reasonable considering small impurity contribution in the samples .    for 2d heisenberg model , the susceptibility maximum is given by @xmath91 .",
    "for bmo with @xmath18 = 3/2 and @xmath30 = 179 k , we obtain @xmath92 = 42 k , which is quite close to the value obtained by fitting the full curve with high temperature expansion model .",
    "this once again ensures the applicability of 2d model to these layered magnetic materials .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "4 ( a ) and ( b ) that the high-@xmath14 series expansion deviates from the experimental data below about 125 k. a possible reason for such deviation is the existence of inter - layer magnetic interaction . if the inter - layer coupling is considered in terms of a molecular field type model , the total susceptibility can be expressed as , @xmath93    here @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the inter - layer exchange and coordination number respectively .",
    "@xcite we have fitted the susceptibility data using above expression of @xmath96 for @xmath47 in eqn .  [ chi ] and the fittings are shown in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it is evident that the introduction of this mean field model improves the fitting and we can fit the data over a wider range of temperature .",
    "we take @xmath95 = 2 for the present case ( since each mn has two inter - layer nearest neighbours ) , and for bmo and smo , the best fit is obtained for @xmath26 and @xmath94 values mentioned in table  [ values ] .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath94 indicates afm inter - layer interaction , which is supported by our isothermal @xmath13 versus @xmath36 data .",
    "the total heat capacity contains both lattice ( @xmath97 ) and magnetic ( @xmath98 ) parts and the magnetic part is generally estimated by subtracting @xmath97 from total @xmath25 .",
    "however , due to nonavailability of a proper nonmagnetic counterpart , it is quite difficult to have a prior knowledge of @xmath97 .",
    "we therefore only looked at the low temperature part of @xmath25 ( below 10 k ) , where @xmath97 is quite small and generally follows a debye @xmath99 law .",
    "it is already evident that @xmath39 versus @xmath40 below 10 k does not follow a linear trend .",
    "in general ( ignoring the electronic part as the sample is an insulator ) at low temperature ( @xmath100/10 , @xmath101 = debye temperature ) for a magnetic system , @xmath102 .",
    "the spin wave contribution of @xmath25 for a magnetically ordered system at sufficiently low temperature can be expressed as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the effective dimension of magnetic interaction and @xmath7 = 2 and 1 respectively for fm and afm orderings  @xcite .",
    "for the present system , the magnetic state is afm , and therefore we have taken @xmath7 = 1 . for a 3d afm system ( with @xmath104= 3 ) , @xmath98",
    "is expected to show @xmath105 nature , which is inseparable from the lattice part .",
    "however , since we get a nonlinear @xmath39 versus @xmath40 curve , a simple @xmath99 nature of @xmath98 is unacceptable .",
    "we have plotted @xmath106 versus @xmath14 , and it gives a better linearity than the @xmath39 versus @xmath40 plot .",
    "this indicates that a predominant @xmath40 term is present in the low-@xmath14 @xmath107 data , which can originate from a 2d afm ordering ( @xmath104 = 2 , @xmath7 = 1 ) with @xmath108 .",
    "however , the @xmath25 versus @xmath14 data can be much better fitted if we incorporate an addition term , @xmath109 , resulting ,    @xmath110    it is to be noted that @xmath111 term is found to exist in several transition metal oxides including perovskite based manganites  @xcite and it is attributed to the nuclear hyperfine contribution to @xmath25 . if the atomic nucleus has a magnetic moment @xmath112 , there can be hyperfine splitting of the energy level due to the effective magnetic field ( @xmath113 ) produced at the nuclear site by the electrons in the partially filled shells and thermal excitation across these hyperfine levels contributes towards @xmath111 . the fitting of @xmath107 by the combination of three terms ( as in eqn .  [ clowt ] )",
    "is shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "3 along with the experimental data .",
    "the values of the fitted parameters are found to be @xmath43 = 0.47(3 ) mj.mol@xmath114.k@xmath115 , @xmath22 = 4.71(8 ) mj.mol@xmath90.k@xmath116 and @xmath117 = 19.98(4 ) mj.k.mol@xmath90 .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath99 contribution is solely arising from the lattice part , one can write @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the number of atoms per formula unit . using the fitted value of @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath101 = 412 k. the coefficient of the 2d spin wave term @xmath22 has a value comparable to many other layered magnetic systems including manganites .",
    "@xcite    one can calculate the effective hyperfine field from the value of @xmath117 using ,    @xmath120    here @xmath121 is the nuclear spin , @xmath112 is the nuclear magnetic moment and @xmath122 is the free space permeability .",
    "the hyperfine interaction is only important for mn nuclei , as it has only partially filled electronic shell to contribute towards hyperfine field at the nuclear site . for mn ,",
    "@xmath121 = 5/2 and using this value in eqn .",
    "[ hyperfine ] we get @xmath123 9 @xmath12410@xmath125 a / m which is equivalent to 2 @xmath12410@xmath126 oe ( in cgs ) .",

    "the present work brings out several interesting aspects regarding the corrugated layered manganites bmo and smo . despite the fact that the samples contain mn@xmath1o@xmath3 building blocks , models based on independent as well as interacting spin - trimers ( interaction taken into account via mean field )",
    "can not interpret the susceptibility data .",
    "the broad peak in the @xmath27 data , a typical signature of low - d magnetic correlation , rather found to be associated with 2d magnetic interaction within the corrugated layers .",
    "the high-@xmath14 series expansion of heisenberg model turns out to be appropriated for the interpretation of susceptibility data .",
    "the calculated values of the intra - layer coupling term @xmath26 are consistent with the maximum in @xmath27 for both the samples .",
    "an additional inter - layer magnetic interaction term @xmath94 is required to fit the @xmath27 data below about 125 k for both bmo and smo .",
    "the intra - layer mn - mn distance is about 2.5  , while the inter - layer distance is about 5.7  .",
    "therefore , there is a chance for the existence of finite @xmath94 in the samples .",
    "the ratio @xmath127 @xmath128 0.05 which is close to the values found in other layered magnetic systems .",
    "it is to be noted that the value of @xmath26 is slightly higher in smo than bmo ( see table i ) , which is consistent with the fact that the mn - mn separation on a particular layer is slightly shorter in the former composition .",
    "similarly , @xmath12 is slightly higher in smo possibly due to the same reason .",
    "the 2d nature of the magnetic correlation is further evident from the low-@xmath14 ( below 10 k ) heat capacity data of bmo where a clear existence of @xmath40 term corresponding to the 2d afm spin wave excitation is found .",
    "this is possibly due to the fact that the magnetic ordering in the compound occurring around @xmath12 = 80 k has 2d character .",
    "it is difficult to rule out the possibility of a long range 3d afm ordering completely from the present @xmath107 , because a 3d afm state would give rise to a @xmath99 variation which is inseparable from the lattice part .",
    "however , it is true that the sample indeed retains 2d spin wave excitation down to the lowest temperature which is likely to be connected with the layered crystal structure .",
    "an intriguing aspect of the present work is the observation of peak like dielectric anomaly close to the afm ordering temperature in both the studied materials .",
    "this is quite an important observation considering the recent interest in multiferroic oxides .",
    "@xcite dielectric anomaly does not show any relaxation with frequency indicating that it is associated with some electric ordering .",
