    "statistical mechanics provides quantitative links between a fluid s interparticle interactions and its resulting equilibrium structure and thermodynamic properties .",
    "however , particularly for dense systems or systems with complex interactions , it can be challenging to find ways for students to explore these relationships within the framework of a university course due to the prohibitive amount of time , expertise ( either computational or experimental ) , and/or resources required to , e.g. , numerically solve the ornstein - zernike relation with an appropriate closure,@xcite construct a molecular simulation to extract relevant equilibrium data,@xcite or carry out relevant measurements in a laboratory.@xcite as a result , for students to become familiar with the relevant concepts , additional tools are required that help them to overcome these technical hurdles .    here ,",
    "we present a web - based applet that helps to accomplish this through use of a new analytic integral equation - based method for equilibrium fluids in three dimensions.@xcite the applet provides rapid and semi - quantitative graphical predictions of structural and thermodynamic quantities from knowledge of the pair interaction and parameters that describe the thermodynamic state ( i.e. , density and temperature ) .",
    "apart from awareness of a few practical constraints , detailed knowledge of the internal calculations is not required to make productive use of the applet as a pedagogical tool or as an experimental guide .",
    "because of its efficiency and accessible layout , students are empowered to interactively experiment with a fluid s pair potential or its thermodynamic state and extract meaningful relationships and trends.@xcite",

    ", to develop an intuition for complex fluid phenomena , without needing a simulation suite or more advanced statistical mechanics coding knowledge .",
    "here we provide examples of how our applet might be used to illustrate two fundamental ideas .      the hard sphere ( hs ) fluid  whose particles have no interaction other than a volume exclusion to prevent interparticle overlap , e.g. @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential])is a canonical reference model for the structure of dense liquid and colloidal systems , and it is one of the simplest models of a non - ideal gas . because the interaction potential is either infinite or zero , its structure is independent of temperature ( as are its energies and dynamics , apart from a trivial scaling related to particle velocities).@xcite despite their simplicity , hard sphere fluids ( like atomic liquids and particle suspensions ) develop nontrivial structure ( e.g. , interparticle correlations ) as density increases . at @xmath46 , the hs fluid experiences a purely entropy - driven freezing transition to form an fcc crystal.@xcite    in fig .",

    "( red ) , where almost no correlations are present beyond the hard core ; @xmath51 ( blue ) ; @xmath52 ( green ) ; and @xmath53 ( orange ) , where correlations extend to nearly six particle diameters and a large population of particles are in contact.,width=309 ]    as the packing fraction is increased , several trends can be readily observed : first , the range of the correlation increases from slightly beyond @xmath54 to nearly @xmath55 as coordination shells of nearest , next - nearest neighbors ( and so on ) develop ; second , the magnitude of the first peak in the radial distribution function increases from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , indicating that particles are contacting one another with greater and greater frequency ; and third , the period of the oscillations ( once they are present ) shrinks as the coordination shells become more condensed . these structural trends with increasing density ,",
    "also commonly seen in simple liquids , result in an increased pressure and reduced excess entropy  both of which are readily verifiable in the applet",
    ".      in liquids more complex than hard spheres , multiple length scales can be present within the pair potential . for example",
    ", in a repulsive ramp system where @xmath58 there are relevant length scales at @xmath54 , at the edge of the hard core , and at @xmath59 , at the outer limit of the interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ramppot ] ) .        for an interaction of this form",
    ", one might expect that at high temperatures ( @xmath60 ) , the energy associated with the finite repulsion outside @xmath61 would be negligible relative to the thermal energy of the system ; therefore , the hard core length scale might be most relevant ( i.e , the system approaches hard - sphere - like structure ) .",
    "conversely , at low temperatures ( @xmath62 ) , contributions from the finite repulsion would be more significant , leading the @xmath63 ( more open , low density ) length scale to dominate .",
    "the applet can be used to demonstrate this phenomenon , by simulating the same ramp potential at a series of different temperatures , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ramps ] ) .    ) ) plotted with the applet , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( red ) , @xmath65 ( blue ) , @xmath66 ( green ) , @xmath67 ( orange ) , and @xmath68 ( magenta).,width=309 ]    at all of these temperatures , clear strong peaks corresponding to the two length scales in the pair potential are present at @xmath54 and @xmath59 .",
    "however , as the temperature decreases , so too does the significance of the inner peak ; below @xmath71 , the outer peak is taller .",
    "these temperature - dependent trends are analogous to those seen in network - forming fluids like liquid water , where the hydrogen - bond network energetically favors low - coordinated , open structures . due to",
    "analogous physics along isobars , at moderate pressures , such structures dominate in water , leading the fluid to exhibit negative thermal expansivity ( expansion upon cooling ) at low temperature  a thermodynamic property also exhibited by the ramp model.@xcite similar features occur in other network forming fluids like silica whose interactions energetically favor locally open structures as well .",
    "this applet provides new opportunities for students and teachers of statistical mechanics to explore and develop a deeper conceptual understanding of the effects of interparticle interactions and the thermodynamic state on the particle - scale equilibrium structure and thermodynamic properties in a fluid system .",

    "we hope to expand its functionality in the future , most immediately by adding options for the use of additional integral equation theory closures in order to treat an even broader variety of possible pair interactions .",
