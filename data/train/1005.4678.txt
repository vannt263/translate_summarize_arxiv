    "dark matter may be composed of thermal relics with mass near the weak scale @xmath6 .",
    "such candidates are produced in the hot early universe and then freeze out when the universe cools and expands .",
    "their annihilation cross section therefore determines both the relic density and the rate of annihilation today .",
    "the requirement that the candidate be much or all of the dark matter therefore constrains its annihilation rate now , with important implications for indirect searches for dark matter .",
    "although annihilation in the early universe and now is determined by the same dynamics , the kinematics are vastly different : at freeze out , thermal relics have relative velocity @xmath7 , whereas today , @xmath8 . as a result , the numerical values of the annihilation cross sections may differ significantly .",
    "for example , neutralino annihilation is in many cases dominated by @xmath9-wave processes  @xcite , and so is suppressed at low velocities . in this work ,",
    "we consider sommerfeld - enhanced cross sections , which have the opposite behavior : they are enhanced at low velocities and therefore boost present - day annihilation signals .",
    "we refine a previous study  @xcite and examine how large these boosts may be , subject to the constraint that the thermal relic has the correct thermal relic density to be dark matter .    along with its general implications for future indirect searches ,",
    "this study also has direct implications for the interpretation of current data . following earlier excesses reported by the heat collaboration  @xcite , the pamela  @xcite , atic  @xcite , and fermi  @xcite collaborations have reported excesses of cosmic positrons over an estimate of expected background  @xcite .",
    "dark matter annihilation with sommerfeld enhancement  @xcite of dark matter annihilation  @xcite , generalized to massive force carriers  @xcite , has been proposed as an explanation  @xcite . in its simplest form",
    ", this scenario assumes that dark matter is composed of a single particle species @xmath10 , which interacts with light force carriers @xmath11 with fine structure constant @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this new interaction modifies dark matter annihilation and scattering properties .",
    "the resulting annihilation cross section multiplied by relative velocity is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is its tree - level value , and @xmath16 is sommerfeld s original enhancement factor  @xcite @xmath17 generalized to massive @xmath11 , where @xmath18 is the dark matter particle s velocity in the center - of - mass frame . in the proposed explanation ,",
    "dark matter freezes out at early times when the sommerfeld effect is negligible with @xmath19 , leading to the correct relic density @xmath20 . at present , however , when @xmath21 is much smaller , the sommerfeld effect becomes important , and , for example , for @xmath22 and an assumed enhancement factor of @xmath23 , such annihilations are sufficient to explain the positron excesses  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that in straightforward models , such large sommerfeld enhancements can not be self - consistently realized .",
    "the problem is simple to state : large sommerfeld enhancement requires strong interactions , and strongly - interacting particles annihilate too efficiently in the early universe to be all of the dark matter .",
    "more quantitatively , the required new force carrier interaction necessarily induces an annihilation process @xmath24 , with cross section @xmath25 conservatively neglecting other annihilation processes , for a typical weak - scale mass @xmath26 , the thermal relic density implies a typical weak coupling @xmath27 $ ] , as dictated by the wimp miracle . the resulting sommerfeld enhancement now is @xmath28 $ ] , an order of magnitude too small to explain the pamela and fermi signals",
    "alternatively , to achieve @xmath23 , one requires @xmath29 , which implies @xmath30 , two orders of magnitude smaller than the value assumed in deriving the requirement @xmath31 .    in this work ,",

    "( [ s0 ] ) . for massive @xmath11 ,",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement cuts off at a value proportional to @xmath34 and also exhibits resonant structure .",
    "here we use numerical results ( and a highly accurate analytic approximation to the numerical results  @xcite ) for @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we refine our previous work to include the effect of sommerfeld enhancement on freeze out",
    ". one might expect this effect to be negligible , because freeze out is typically thought to occur at @xmath35 , when the sommerfeld effect is insignificant .",
    "however , annihilation continues to much later times , and sommerfeld enhancement has an impact when the dark matter cools .",
    "sommerfeld effects on freeze out have been considered previously in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of wino dark matter and in refs .",
    "@xcite for hidden sector dark matter . in the analyses published",
    "after the pamela and fermi excesses were reported  @xcite , @xmath15 was taken as a free parameter , and the fact that it depends on the same parameters that determine @xmath16 was not used . here",
    "we make essential use of the observation that there is a irreducible contribution to @xmath15 of the form of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , and so constraints on the relic density bound the fundamental parameters that also determine @xmath16 .",
    "as we will see , the combination of these two refinements highlights a number of effects that may typically be ignored , but now require exploration .",
    "for example , the relic density is in principle affected by the cutoff of resonant sommerfeld enhancement , the production and decay rates of force carrier particles , the temperature of kinetic decoupling , and the efficiency of self - scattering for preserving the dark matter s thermal velocity distribution . very close to resonances",
    ", we also find the intriguing possibility of chemical _ recoupling _ , in which dark matter freezes out and then melts back in , with annihilations becoming important again at late times .",
    "this implies that exact resonances suppress , rather than enhance , indirect signals .",
    "we examine the quantitative impact of all of these effects , and present results for the maximal sommerfeld enhancement of indirect signals . in the most optimistic case , that is , tuning all parameters to maximize the signal , we find that , for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , 0.3 , and 1 tev , the largest possible effective sommerfeld enhancements are @xmath2 , 30 , and 90 , respectively .",
    "this refined analysis therefore strengthens our previous results : sommerfeld enhancements may be significant , but they fall short of explaining the current pamela and fermi cosmic ray excesses .",
    "we then discuss various astrophysical effects that may reduce the discrepancy between the maximal enhancements derived here and those required to explain the data , and critically examine several non - minimal models and the issues that must be addressed to determine if more complicated particle physics models may provide viable explanations .",

    "a more complicated set of astrophysical uncertainties is related to astrophysical backgrounds and the signals themselves .",
    "for example , the required sommerfeld enhancement may be reduced if conventional astrophysical backgrounds have been under - estimated , cosmic ray propagation models are modified , pulsars contribute significantly to the positron flux , or the pamela @xmath273 sample includes some proton contamination",
    ". any of these effects could reduce the required dark matter signal , but they could also plausibly eliminate the need for dark matter altogether , as has been argued in numerous studies  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore typically unclear what the motivation would be for assuming that such effects account for part of the signal but not all of it , independent of a desire to leave room for a dark matter signal .    a possible exception to the above argument is the possibility of adjusting cosmic ray propagation models to match the fermi spectrum .",

    "the present conclusion in the literature seems to that significant deviations from the pure @xmath4 channel do not provide a good fit to data .",
    "one way forward would be to redo fits of the kind discussed in literature , allowing for variations in cosmic ray propagation model parameters to see if this conclusion holds up in general . in any case , a careful statistical analysis is required before appeals to alternative channels alone may be considered as a way to allow sommerfeld scenarios to explain the data .      for the case of attractive forces ,",

    "as in the case of positronium , when this is kinematically possible , annihilation through bound states is preferred . in the limits",
    "@xmath298 and @xmath299 , the annihilation rate enhancement is about @xmath300 for fermions , where @xmath301 is the velocity of the final state @xmath11 particle when the bound state forms  @xcite .",
    "this is roughly a factor of 7 larger than @xmath33 when @xmath302 .",
    "unfortunately , such bound state effects do not help sommerfeld enhancement models explain the pamela and fermi data for two reasons .",
    "first , bound state formation is kinematically forbidden in large parts of parameter space that yield the best fits to data , and the large factor of 7 enhancement alluded to above is not realized for most of the parameter space plotted in fig .  [ fig : fit1gev ] . to see this , we first need to compute the value of @xmath12 required to get the right relic density .",
    "now , bound states may form in the early universe when they are energetically viable , that is when @xmath303 , and hence affect the relic density calculation .",
    "for simplicity we neglect this effect here , and use the same @xmath12 values from fig .",
    "[ fig : alphamx ] , which leads to a conservative bound .",
    "then , for @xmath304 , the bound state enhancement formula quoted above is valid only for @xmath305 .",
    "these inequalities are not satisfied for parameters that are most promising for fitting the data ( @xmath306 and @xmath307 )",
    ".    second , if bound states form , they are likely to be in conflict with bounds from the cmb . to see this ,",
    "let s saturate the bound state enhancement at @xmath308 and estimate the enhancement at recombination as @xmath309 .",
    "this should be compared to the cmb bound of @xmath310 , where we have set @xmath311 to be conservative . to satisfy the cmb bound , then",
    ", we require @xmath312 .",
    "this is generically violated if @xmath12 is fixed by the relic density .",
    "for example , for @xmath221 , the bound implies @xmath313 . requiring",
    "the correct relic density then implies @xmath314 .",
    "however , we need @xmath315 for bound states to form with @xmath221 .",
    "the situation is no different with @xmath316 .",
    "thus our saturation approximation above ( for bound state enhancement ) suggests that regions of parameter spaces where bound states can form are generically in conflict with the cmb .",
    "a potentially more promising direction is to construct more complicated particle physics models to achieve sommerfeld enhancements that are large enough to explain pamela and fermi .",
    "such models will generically include additional annihilation channels .",
    "we begin by discussing the impact of these channels in general , and then examine various strategies one might explore to achieve larger @xmath3 .",
    "as discussed above , to maximize @xmath3 , we have considered only @xmath24 annihilation , leading to the typical tree - level cross section estimate of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) . even in the simplest models ,",
    "however , one may have additional annihilation channels .",
    "for example , if @xmath11 is a u(1 ) gauge boson with mass generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking through the higgs potential @xmath317 with mass @xmath318 , where @xmath53 is related to the @xmath11 mass by @xmath319 . for perturbative",
    "@xmath320 , @xmath321 ; @xmath322 may be much lighter than @xmath11 , but it can not be much heavier .",
    "the hidden higgs boson therefore can not be decoupled either dynamically or kinematically , and there is necessarily an additional annihilation channel @xmath323 . in the non - relativistic limit , and assuming there is no yukawa coupling @xmath324 , the cross section is @xmath325 where @xmath326^{1/2 } } { 4 m_x } \\ .\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath327 , @xmath328 additional annihilation channels and their impact on relic densities in sommerfeld enhanced models have also been considered in , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to roughly accommodate such modifications , we may parameterize the effect of additional annihilation channels by assuming a tree - level annihilation cross section @xmath329 where @xmath330 is a constant .",
    "if the new structures do not significantly modify the sommerfeld enhancement @xmath16 , the desired relic density will be achieved by modifying @xmath331 , moving the positions of resonances and reducing the maximal @xmath3 by the factor @xmath332 . in general , sommerfeld enhancement in the early universe is important and the reduction in maximal @xmath3 is smaller .",
    "the effects of varying @xmath330 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kfigs ] .     for @xmath333 , where the tree - level annihilation cross section is @xmath334 , for @xmath335 ( left ) and @xmath221 ( right ) .",

    "[ fig : kfigs],title=\"fig : \" ]    of course , in general , new annihilation channels may have different couplings @xmath12 , different kinetic decoupling features , and different @xmath182 , all leading to different sommerfeld effects , resonances in different places , and many other effects that can not be captured by a single extra parameter @xmath330 .",
    "the availability of additional annihilation channels also has a complicated effect on the signal .",
    "for example , for the case of decays to higgs bosons and assuming @xmath337 through real or virtual @xmath11 pairs , the @xmath338 mode leads to six or more leptons .",
    "this channel changes the energy spectrum of positrons that would be seen by pamela and fermi and thus requires new fits to the data .",
    "the full analysis is therefore complicated , and requires a dedicated study incorporating all of these effects into the freeze out analysis .",
    "the main point is that non - minimal models will typically include additional hidden sector states and additional annihilation channels , generically reducing the maximum possible @xmath3 consistent with thermal relic density constraints .",
    "two - state dark matter models have received considerably attention recently .",
    "for example , `` inelastic dark matter '' has been motivated by the dama nai signal  @xcite and `` exciting dark matter '' has been proposed to explain the integral / spi excess towards the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "they have also been proposed as explanations of the pamela excess and the wmap haze towards the galactic center  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the stable dark matter state is accompanied by a more massive unstable state , which is separated from the stable state by a mass gap that is chosen to fit the data and is much smaller than the dark matter mass .",
    "the presence of this almost degenerate excited state significantly complicates the early universe freeze out analysis .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancements are also different  @xcite .",
    "to compute the relic density , one would need to include the additional annihilation channels and the two - state dark matter sommerfeld enhancement in a self - consistent early universe freeze out calculation .",
    "dark matter models with multiple _",
    "stable _ dark matter states have also been proposed to explain the pamela and fermi excesses and the dama / libra signal  @xcite .",
    "these models provide an interesting avenue to reduce the required sommerfeld enhancement to explain both the pamela and fermi excesses  @xcite .",
    "this is because the heavier ( @xmath339 ) component contributes mainly to the fermi excess , whereas the lighter ( @xmath340 ) dark matter particle contributes predominantly to the pamela positron excess .",
    "the required sommerfeld enhancements are about 100 for the tev state .",
    "such enhancements may appear to be consistent with our relic density constraint to within a factor of 2 , but the relic density calculation that we have presented here is not complete in these scenarios . in the simplest such models",
    "@xcite , the two states couple to the dark gauge boson with the same charge .",
    "as stated , however , these models are ruled out by the direct detection limits , because the @xmath341 cross section due to the kinetic mixing would be too large for @xmath342  @xcite .",
    "the way out of this constraint is to specify that each state is further split into a metastable and stable state with very small mass gap and that the @xmath11 particles only have off - diagonal couplings , so that kinetic energy larger than the mass gap is required to initiate @xmath343 , where @xmath344 denotes the excited state of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "these mass gaps may then be chosen to be @xmath345 or @xmath346 to explain integral / spi and dama / libra signals respectively  @xcite .",
    "the relic density calculation is now significantly more complicated .",
    "additional annihilation channels , for example , annihilations between the heavy and light states and annihilation to @xmath347 , and the presence of an almost degenerate state must be taken into account in the early universe calculation .",
    "the sommerfeld effect for the lighter state is generically important because the coupling to the dark gauge boson would be set by the relic density constraint for the heavy particle , and so @xmath348 , much larger than the required @xmath12 for thermal dark matter with mass @xmath349 .",
    "the new channels , such as the @xmath347 channel , also modify comparisons to pamela and fermi as these new channels may contribute to the @xmath284 flux with a different energy spectrum .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "multi - state dark matter theories may also have significantly suppressed @xmath330 . for example , in the non - abelian models of ref .",
    "@xcite , values of @xmath330 as small as @xmath350 are possible , and these have recently been claimed to provide marginally consistent explanations of the cosmic ray anomalies  @xcite . in these studies , however , the irreducible annihilations to higgs bosons have not been included , and the sommerfeld effect on freeze out has been neglected .",
    "given the low value of @xmath330 , these changes to the annihilation cross section may be important",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the consistency remains after a complete analysis .    to summarize ,",
    "finding a model with more degrees of freedom that requires smaller boosts to fit the pamela and fermi data does not by itself imply an improvement , as the bounds on @xmath3 will generically also be stronger .",
    "generalizations of the freeze out analysis described here are required to determine if these scenarios may self - consistently explain pamela and fermi data .",
    "one reason the maximal @xmath3 is somewhat limited is that the resonances are not significant for @xmath234 and @xmath352 . for larger",
    "@xmath52 , however , the resonances move to larger @xmath26 , as evident from eq .",
    "( [ mphiresonance ] ) .",
    "generically , for @xmath353 , @xmath11 decay may produce anti - protons .",
    "however , if such contributions to the anti - proton spectrum may be otherwise suppressed or accommodated  @xcite , such large @xmath52 may allow one to improve the consistency of sommerfeld - based explanations of the pamela and fermi data .",
    "as an example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a leptophilic model was constructed where the anti - proton flux is suppressed by dynamics , freeing the force carrier mass to be much larger than @xmath354 . for @xmath355 and @xmath356",
    ", the authors noted that resonant sommerfeld enhancement could enhance signals with enhancement factors as large as @xmath23 .",
    "however , the study of ref .",
    "@xcite did not include the higgs annihilation channel , and did not include the impact of sommerfeld enhancement on freeze out .",
    "note also that , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : phidecay ] , for very large @xmath52 near the freeze out temperature , @xmath11 particles may not be in complete thermal equilibrium with the standard model , modifying the freeze out analysis .",
    "nevertheless , such possibilities certainly merit further study .",
    "note , though , that these models are inaccessible to searches for gev forces .      in all of our analysis above , we have assumed that the running of the gauge coupling in the dark sector is not significant .",
    "although this is certainly a good approximation for the minimal abelian model we have considered , the situation is much more complicated for non - abelian models .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that a non - abelian hidden sector could explain both pamela and fermi , while resulting in the correct relic density  @xcite .",
    "this work notes that the sommerfeld effect is a soft process and the enhancement factor @xmath16 is determined by the coupling at scale @xmath52 , whereas for the tree - level cross section the coupling must be evaluated at @xmath26 . for a non - abelian theory where",
    "the coupling constant is smaller at higher energies , this could significantly relax the tension between the relic density constraint and the requirements for explaining pamela and fermi .",
    "however , this analysis  @xcite did not include the sommerfeld effect on the annihilation in the early universe",
    ". this would be particularly important because the sommerfeld enhancement is now much larger even in the early universe .",
    "the model also includes a higgs doublet @xmath67 and the dark matter annihilation @xmath357 must also be included .",
    "the stability of the higgs sector is a major concern for these models because the higgs annihilation cross section is too small to suppress their relic density  @xcite .",
    "the decay lifetimes that have been computed  @xcite are long ( @xmath358 or longer ) and could destroy the successful predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) because of the injection of electromagnetic energy  @xcite .",
    "given these issues , it is not clear that these models can successfully satisfy the relic density constraints , but future work addressing these points could be an interesting way forward to explain pamela and fermi excesses using sommerfeld - enhanced annihilation .",
    "we note that the arguments regarding the decay of the hidden sector higgs boson are quite general .",
    "the hidden higgs boson should decay to standard model particles , otherwise it would contribute to the dark matter abundance . in doing so , the decays should not destroy the successful predictions of bbn .",
    "in this work , we have investigated scenarios with sommerfeld - enhanced annihilation of thermal dark matter and determined the largest possible indirect signals , subject to the most basic of constraints , namely , that the thermal dark matter have the correct thermal relic density .",
    "in addition to their potential impact on cosmic @xmath284 spectra , such scenarios may also predict observable effects in the cosmic microwave background and the diffuse extragalactic @xmath359-ray background , excess @xmath359-ray , neutrino and radio wave emission from the galactic center , and excess @xmath359-rays from dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way and extended regions centered on the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "the absence of each of these potential signatures provides significant constraints .",
    "the bounds derived here are complementary to those , in that these bounds are derived by studying not the annihilation products , but the production .",
    "these results are therefore model - independent and robust , in that they assume only that the dark matter is produced by thermal freeze out , which is the central assumption motivating the consideration of sommerfeld enhancements in the first place .",
    "this analysis included the possibility of resonant sommerfeld enhancement and the effect of sommerfeld enhancement in the thermal relic density calculation .",
    "the possibility of sommerfeld enhancement at low velocities , with annihilation cross sections proportional to @xmath360 , or even @xmath361 on resonance , implies that the thermal relic density is sensitive to the dark matter density s evolution long after conventional freeze out at @xmath362 . as a result ,",
    "the relic density depends on many aspects absent in conventional scenarios .",
    "these include the cutoff of resonant sommerfeld annihilation , the equilibration of force carrier particles , the temperature of kinetic decoupling @xmath93 , and the efficiency of self - scattering to thermalize the dark matter velocity distribution after @xmath93",
    ".    these dependences may be very important .",
    "a non - generic but intriguing example is that , on resonance , dark matter freezes out but may then later melt in , chemically recoupling for a second era of efficient annihilation . as a result ,",
    "exact resonances suppress rather than enhance indirect signals , in contrast to naive expectations .",
    "more generally , the sommerfeld enhancement of freeze out implies that smaller tree - level annihilation cross sections are required to give the correct relic density , and so reduces the effective sommerfeld enhancement of indirect signals .",
    "we have found reduction factors of a few , with several @xmath363 variations possible , depending on the value of @xmath93 and other freeze out parameters .    for the minimal scenario analyzed here , and adopting the most optimistic assumptions to maximize indirect signals , the largest possible values of @xmath3 are 7 , 30 , and 90 for @xmath36 and @xmath1 , 0.3 and 1 tev , respectively .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fit ] and [ fig : fit1gev ] , such enhancements fall short of explaining the pamela and fermi cosmic @xmath284 excesses . for the best fit point , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , this discrepancy is over an order of magnitude and can not be eliminated by appeals to enhanced local dark matter density or boosts from small scale structure .",
    "bound state effects are also unable to eliminate the inconsistency , as they are typically insignificant in the parameter regions that may potentially explain the cosmic ray anomalies , and are in any case stringently constrained by the cmb .",
    "along with the astrophysical uncertainties discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] and the complementary constraints from the cosmic microwave background and other sources , these results imply that the dark matter motivations for sommerfeld enhancements and gev dark forces at present are , at best , strained .",
    "we have discussed several possibly interesting directions for further study in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] .",
    "non - minimal models will generically include additional annihilation channels , such as those involving hidden higgs bosons .",
    "these will generically strengthen the bounds on @xmath3 .",
    "we noted also that the decay of the hidden sector higgs boson to standard model particles could be constrained by demanding consistency with the measured light element abundances produced during bbn .",
    "additional features and constraints particular to specific models have been noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] .",
    "we have focused on the @xmath4 final state here , which generically give the best fits to the data .",
    "different annihilation channels , such as @xmath5 final states , are optimized at lower @xmath3 and @xmath26 , but also yield worse fits to the data according to present estimates in the literature .",
    "however , this conclusion may depend significantly on the cosmic ray propagation model parameters used .",
    "at present , no sommerfeld models have been shown to explain the pamela and fermi excesses consistent with the constraint of thermal freeze out , and we stress that complete and dedicated studies of freeze out are required to judge properly whether more complicated models can self - consistently explain pamela and fermi data .",
    "the maximal sommerfeld enhancements derived here , although not sufficient to explain current pamela and fermi excesses , are nevertheless significant enhancements . these will be probed as pamela and fermi continue to gather data , and , in the near future , at ams on the international space station .",
    "the interpretation of future data as dark matter may , of course , continue to be clouded by confusion from astrophysical uncertainties , but the diverse set of particle physics and astroparticle physics experiments that may probe weak - scale dark matter in the near future at least provides some reason for optimism .",

    "<S> the annihilation cross section of thermal relic dark matter determines both its relic density and indirect detection signals . we determine how large indirect signals may be in scenarios with sommerfeld - enhanced annihilation , subject to the constraint that the dark matter has the correct relic density . </S>",
    "<S> this work refines our previous analysis through detailed treatments of resonant sommerfeld enhancement and the effect of sommerfeld enhancement on freeze out . </S>",
    "<S> sommerfeld enhancements raise many interesting issues in the freeze out calculation , and we find that the cutoff of resonant enhancement , the equilibration of force carriers , the temperature of kinetic decoupling , and the efficiency of self - interactions for preserving thermal velocity distributions all play a role . </S>",
    "<S> these effects may have striking consequences ; for example , for resonantly - enhanced sommerfeld annihilation , dark matter freezes out but may then chemically _ recouple _ , implying highly suppressed indirect signals , in contrast to naive expectations . in the minimal scenario with standard astrophysical assumptions , and tuning all parameters to maximize the signal </S>",
    "<S> , we find that , for force - carrier mass @xmath0 and dark matter masses @xmath1 , 0.3 , and 1 tev , the maximal sommerfeld enhancement factors are @xmath2 , 30 , and 90 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> such boosts are too small to explain both the pamela and fermi excesses . </S>",
    "<S> non - minimal models may require smaller boosts , but the bounds on @xmath3 could also be more stringent , and dedicated freeze out analyses are required . for concreteness , we focus on @xmath4 final states , but we also discuss @xmath5 and other modes , deviations from standard astrophysical assumptions and non - minimal particle physics models , and we outline the steps required to determine if such considerations may lead to a self - consistent explanation of the pamela or fermi excesses . </S>"
