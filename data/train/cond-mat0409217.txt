    "the physics of atomic vibrations in perfect crystals is well understood @xcite . in the presence of disorder ( e.g. noncrystallinity ) , many extra phenomena are observed : for example , localization @xcite , the boson peak ( extra modes at low frequencies ) @xcite , and anomalies in the specific heat @xcite and thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "the microscopic origin of these and other , similar , phenomena have been difficult to deduce . in particular",
    ", it would be helpful to know the contributions due to different types of disorder . in this paper",
    ", we consider the effects of three types of disorder : _ force - constant disorder _ , in which the strengths of the springs between the atoms are disordered , _ positional disorder _ , in which the atomic positions are disordered , and _ topological disorder _ ,",
    "in which the network of bonds is disordered .",
    "we compare the behaviour of models with force - constant and positional disorders ( separately and in combination ) to those of a realistic atomic model .",
    "a further aim is to see if it is possible to mimic the behaviour of amorphous systems with an appropriately - disordered crystal .",
    "in this paper , we study 3d diamond - cubic crystal lattices , in which all atoms are connected by springs , and have the same mass .",
    "we assume that the displacements from equilibrium are small , and use the _ harmonic approximation_. hence , we can treat the system classically @xcite , and describe the vibrations by a hermitian dynamical matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the problem can then be treated in the hamiltonian formalism @xcite , with energy @xmath1 , the squared vibrational frequency .",
    "we study the effect of disorder on the _ spectral density _ :",
    "@xmath2 , where @xmath3 represents configurational averaging .",
    "we can represent the spectral - density operator in the crystalline basis @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the wavevector of a plane wave , and @xmath6 is the polarization @xcite . in this case , the spectral density @xmath7 is : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the weights of the ( disordered ) eigenstate @xmath10 ( with energy @xmath11 ) in the crystalline eigenstate @xmath4 .",
    "large ( @xmath12 atoms ) diamond - cubic crystals have been simulated , with nearest - neighbour spring constant @xmath13 and next - nearest - neighbour spring constant @xmath14 .",
    "a ratio of @xmath15 was chosen , as this gave a vibrational density of states ( vdos ) most like that of a crystal with the more realistic modified stillinger - weber ( msw ) potential @xcite .",
    "force - constant disorder was added by randomly taking the spring constants from a uniform distribution of half width @xmath16 , centred on the crystalline spring - constant value .",
    "the width @xmath16 is expressed as a fraction of the crystalline spring - constant value @xmath17 , and this fraction is the same for both spring constants . to avoid mechanical instabilities ,",
    "widths were limited such that all force constants were positive , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "positional disorder was introduced by randomly shifting all atoms by distances , chosen from gaussian distributions centred on zero with half width @xmath19 , independently in the @xmath20- , @xmath21- and @xmath22-directions .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the dispersion relation for a positionally - disordered diamond lattice with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the nearest - neighbour distance . at each value of @xmath25 ,",
    "the spectral density has been orientationally averaged , and the positions of the peaks are shown in the figure .",
    "the dispersion relation shows many of the expected features : three acoustic branches are observed , of which one is longitudinal , and two are transverse . mixing between the polarisations is seen : the longitudinal spectral density picks up the peaks due to the transverse acoustic ( ta ) branches .",
    "the optic modes are less clearly defined ; the peaks due to these modes were broadened considerably by even small amounts of disorder . nevertheless , the presence of optic branches at high energy in both the transverse and longitudinal spectral densities is observed .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    the effect of a low degree of positional disorder on the spectral density is qualitatively very similar to the effect of small force - constant disorder @xcite ; the peak shifts in position , and broadens . when compared to the spectral density of a realistic 4096-atom model of amorphous silicon , generated with a modified www procedure @xcite and relaxed under the msw potential , it was observed that neither type of disorder was adequate on its own to reproduce the features of the amorphous model s spectral density .",
    "a combination of these two types of disorder is better able to reproduce the spectral density , as seen in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the disordered lattice models are able to mimic the main features of the amorphous model , with peak positions and shapes at least roughly correct , but they often have more peaks ( particularly at high @xmath25 ) than the rather smoother amorphous spectral densities . this is due to the orientational averaging - each of these peaks comes from a different orientation of the @xmath5-vector .",
    "the fact that these peaks are at different energies suggests that , despite the added disorder , the lattice models are still anisotropic , whereas the amorphous model is isotropic ( since the multiple peaks are absent ) .",
    "this implies that a form of disorder needs to be considered that will render the lattice models less anisotropic .",
    "another type of disorder is topological disorder , in which the bond network is disordered such that the ring - size distribution is no longer crystalline .",
    "topological disorder was examined by studying the dynamical matrix .",
    "if two atoms @xmath26 and @xmath27 interact , then the dynamical matrix elements representing that interaction will be non - zero .",
    "we make use of a simple atom renumbering scheme and show the dynamical matrix graphically , to compare the topological disorder present in the realistic model and in positionally - disordered models .",
    "atoms were renumbered by first dividing the models into small cubes , such that the average occupation was one atom per small cube .",
    "the models are cubic , with side @xmath28 .",
    "the origin was taken at one corner of the model ( say @xmath29 ) , and atoms were numbered by moving up through all the small cubes above it in the positive @xmath22-direction , numbering the atoms in order of the @xmath22-coordinate of their position .",
    "once the @xmath30 face of the model was reached , the scheme returned to the @xmath31 face , and moved along one small cube distance in the @xmath21-direction .",
    "as before , atoms were numbered by moving up in the @xmath22-direction .",
    "this process was repeated until the @xmath32 face was reached , when the scheme returned to @xmath33 and shifted along one small cube in the @xmath20-direction , and then repeated the numbering above , until all atoms were numbered .",
    "the atom number now corresponds ( in some way ) to its position .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ fig:3 ]    in this renumbering scheme , the dynamical matrix of a crystalline diamond lattice with nearest- and next - nearest neighbour interactions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a .",
    "the effect of introducing positional disorder ( @xmath34 ) , into the diamond lattice , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b . the realistic model of amorphous silicon , with the same renumbering scheme ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c . remarkably , the dynamical matrix for the realistic model ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c ) looks very similar to that of the positionally - disordered crystal ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b ) .",
    "we interpret this as implying that the short - range structural order , responsible for the vibrational behaviour , in the topologically - disordered amorphous model is very close to that in a positionally - disordered crystal .",
    "examining the spectral densities of diamond lattice models with added force - constant and positional disorders shows that these disorders are insufficient ( either by themselves or in combination ) to mimic completely the vibrational behaviour of a realistic model of amorphous silicon . representing",
    "the neighbour list graphically shows that the short - range order , responsible for the vibrational behaviour , in a positionally - disordered diamond lattice is similar to that of a realistic model , and this is an avenue for further research .",
