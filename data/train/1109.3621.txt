    "currently there are many efforts both on the theoretical , as well as on the experimental side to gain knowledge about the phase diagram of strongly interacting nuclear matter .",
    "experiments with highly energetic colliding gold nuclei at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) suggest that a new state of matter , comparable to a nearly perfect fluid , is created at high temperatures  @xcite . while these experiments at rhic and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , performed at very high beam energies , aim at the high - temperature , low - density region of the phase diagram , there are also experiments in which higher baryonic densities may be reached , as for example planned at the upcoming facility for antiproton an ion research ( fair ) at gsi .",
    "common to all these experiments is the search for the phase transition of strongly interacting matter from a confined state of hadrons at low temperatures to a state with deconfined quarks and gluons ( qgp ) as it is predicted for high densities and high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this phase transition is commonly referred to as deconfinement transition  @xcite .",
    "the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , however , imply another , _",
    "chiral _ phase transition at which the chiral symmetry is restored and the masses of the baryons , or constituent quarks , vanish  @xcite . for this transition ,",
    "on which we will mainly focus our studies , the chiral condensate @xmath2 acts as the corresponding order parameter .",
    "since qcd can not be treated perturbatively at low temperatures , most information we have about the phase diagram of qcd matter today comes from lattice qcd calculations  @xcite . in the region of vanishing baryochemical potentials @xmath3 and finite temperature , lattice qcd yields reliable results that show a smooth crossover transition  @xcite . for finite potentials",
    "@xmath4 , however , results from lattice qcd are not available because of the failing of standard monte carlo sampling methods due to the so - called sign - problem .",
    "currently there are various methods to extend the lattice results from @xmath3 to the region of small chemical potentials  @xcite .",
    "some lattice qcd groups suggest that the phase transition becomes first order at a critical endpoint  @xcite with its coordinates varying considerably for different calculations .",
    "other more recent results  @xcite favour the exclusive existence of a crossover transition for a wide range of baryon densities , implying the non - existence of such a critical point .",
    "moreover , the exact position of the phase transition in the phase diagram is subject of a lively and ongoing debate .    other common theoretical approaches to qcd are effective models to study specific properties of qcd matter  @xcite . in our approach we will use an effective model for the qcd equation of state to study the properties of the phase diagram of nuclear matter .",
    "our model is able to reproduce the well known saturation properties of nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the degrees of freedom in our model are all known baryons and baryonic resonances up to masses of @xmath5  gev .",
    "this approach resembles an interacting hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) .",
    "the hrg is known to give a good description of thermodynamic quantities at low temperatures ( @xmath6 ) and was often used to reproduce lattice qcd results for thermodynamics and fluctuations of conserved charges at low temperatures  @xcite . the particle production in heavy ion collisions",
    "may also be reasonably well described with use of the hrg  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our first approach to use only hadronic degrees of freedom seems to be appropriate up to at least temperatures in the range of @xmath7 . for higher temperatures , at the latest",
    "when the deconfinement phase transition sets in , this approach breaks down and , in a future step , partonic degrees of freedom need to be taken into account as it was done in refs .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "first we introduce the chiral @xmath8 model in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "we present results for the order parameter of the chiral condensate @xmath2 at zero and nonzero baryochemical potentials , thermodynamic quantities from the model , and quark susceptibilities at different points in the phase diagram .",
    "susceptibilities are interesting quantities since they resemble fluctuations of conserved charges which itself are closely linked to phase transitions . they offer an effective possibility of comparison between results from theory and experiment because the susceptibilities can be related to measured fluctuations of particle production .",
    "of particular interest are susceptibility ratios since they are not dependent on the volume or the impact parameter of the underlying system  @xcite .",
    "this work closes with a conclusion in section iv .",
    "in our model , a @xmath8-flavour sigma - omega model using the non - linear realization of chiral symmetry ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) , the lagrangian in mean field approximation has the form @xmath9 here , the first term represents the kinetic energy of the hadrons , the terms @xmath10 describe the interaction of the baryons with the scalar mesons @xmath2 , @xmath11 ( attractive interaction , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : effective_mass ] ) ) and the vector mesons @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( repulsive interaction ) respectively .",
    "the summation index @xmath14 runs over the baryon octet ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , the baryon decuplet ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , and all heavier resonance states up to masses of @xmath23  mev .",
    "we only include hadronic resonances whose existence is considered to be very likely according to the particle data group listings  @xcite where they are recorded with a minimum three - star rating . since the listed masses of some heavy resonances may cover a broad range , all particles are included with their average mass .",
    "the third term of the lagrangian @xmath24 includes the self interactions of the vector mesons and the scalar mesons together with the last two terms describing the explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "the effective masses of the baryons @xmath25 are created by the coupling of the baryons to the scalar meson fields ( i.e.  the non - strange chiral condensate @xmath2 and its strange equivalent @xmath11 ) , together with an explicit mass of at least @xmath26  mev . in this way at high temperatures and baryonic densities the decreasing @xmath2-field leads to smaller baryon masses and thus to the restoration of chiral symmetry . thereby the nucleons which have the smallest explicit mass have lost roughly @xmath27 of their vacuum mass at @xmath7 . since our model only includes hadronic degrees of freedom it can only be applied in the hadronic regime up to temperatures slightly above @xmath7 .",
    "this also prevents baryonic masses from getting to small so that the mean field approximation should remain valid and no fluctuations need necessarily to be taken into account as it was for example done in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effective masses of the pseudoscalar mesons and vector mesons are given by the second derivative of the mesonic potential @xmath28 with respect to the respective mesons @xmath29 at the minimum of the grand canonical potential ( see eq .  )  @xcite @xmath30    the couplings of the baryon octet to the mesonic fields and the mesonic potential are chosen in such a way as to reproduce the well - known vacuum masses , the nuclear ground state properties ( e.g.the correct binding energy ) , and the asymmetry energy .",
    "the coupling strengths of the baryons of the decuplet and all heavier resonances are scaled to the nucleon couplings via the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 according to @xmath33 in this paper we systematically analyse the influence of the baryonic resonances on the hadronic matter properties .",
    "therefor we adjust the vector coupling parameter @xmath32 , controlling the abundance of the baryonic resonances at finite baryochemical potentials in the model , in order to study the influence on the resulting phase diagram and the thermodynamic properties of the model .",
    "we use this one - parameter approximation in order not to be swamped by a plethora of of unknown coupling constants of the various hadronic multiplets . in this work we set",

    "the scalar couplings are fixed by reproducing the particles vacuum masses ( except for the explicit mass term @xmath35 ) .    as a reference",
    "we also perform calculations for an ideal hrg that is not interacting with the mesonic fields . in this particular case",
    "all baryon couplings to the fields @xmath36 are set to zero and the masses of all particles are fixed at their tabulated vacuum expectation value .",

    "the slope of the chiral condensate from our model is relatively steep and deviates from those suggested by lattice qcd calculations .",
    "this is mainly due to neglecting contributions from pseudoscalar meson self interactions which are important at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the slope of @xmath2 could be leveled by including the @xmath75 self interaction in the model  @xcite .",

    "using this model , at zero baryochemical potential @xmath62 we found a smooth crossover phase transition for the order parameter of the chiral condensate @xmath2 with a critical temperature in the range from @xmath68  mev to @xmath69  mev depending on the excluded volume effects being taken into account .",
    "these results are in good agreement with various data from lattice qcd . extending this study to finite @xmath62",
    ", we show the strong dependence of the phase transition , i.e.  position and order , on the vector coupling strength . for reasonable values of @xmath32 , we find that the phase transition is a smooth crossover in the whole @xmath0@xmath62 plane and that there is no critical end point .",
    "we also show the thermodynamic quantities from the model and calculate the quark number and strange quark number susceptibility coefficients at different values of @xmath62 .",
    "the susceptibilities show a good qualitatively agreement with lattice data if a sufficiently strong vector coupling is chosen .",
    "this finding underlines the model suggestion of the non - existence of the critical end point .",
    "if the susceptibilities are extracted at different positions on the phase boundary , we show that their significantly different behavior may be used to distinguish the order of the phase transition at a given point .",
