    "the unsolved problem of dark energy @xcite generate a number of so - called modified gravity theories @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest from this modifications of gravity is @xmath0 gravity @xcite , where scalar curvature @xmath8 in einstein - hilbert action is replaced with some function @xmath0 , so the action take the form    @xmath9    it is well known that equation of motion for this theory reads : @xmath10 this equation contain higher derivatives with respect to metric up to the forth instead of the second one in general relativity , and this fact may be the reason of different instabilities of classical solutions .",
    "there are two most general restrictions , which may be found by the different ways : @xmath2 to guarantee that graviton is not a ghost ( or to avoid antigravity on the classical level ) and @xmath3 to guarantee that particle associated with a new degree of freedom and named scalaron @xcite is not tachyon .",
    "there are may be different additional restrictions for @xmath0 gravity also , which associated with another solutions , for instance jeans instability @xcite or de sitter stability condition @xcite .",
    "also such kind of theories may lead to the multiple de sitter solution , which allow to describe inflation and late time acceleration within the unified approach @xcite . in this sense minkowski solution",
    "takes a special place : from the one hand its stability is very important for theory by the obvious reasons , from another hand the investigation of this stability is very hard task by the usual dynamical system approach ( which working good in de sitter case ) , because of vanish eigenvalues . in this case",
    "we need to investigate central manifold from mathematical point of view and this task is much more time - consuming .",
    "we can see the good illustration of troubles on this way in @xcite , where minkowski stability was investigate in the simplest case of quadratic @xmath0 gravity @xcite , which is still under consideration @xcite .",
    "some another considerations about minkowski stability was discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study stability of minkowski solution by the dynamical system approach , but using some mathematical trick , which allow us obtain result without central manifold studying .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we develop our method and apply it to @xmath0 gravity model . in section 3",
    "we study minkowski stability in one of the simplest case of higher order gravity with @xmath11 in the action . and",
    "in section 4 we turn to the scalar - tensor gravity model with non - minimal kinetic coupling .",
    "some concluding remarks may be found in section 5 .",
    "first of all let us discuss flrw metric @xmath12 with @xmath13-term as the simplest non - trivial matter @xmath14 in this case full dynamical picture is described by the @xmath15-component of eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) ( for the sakes of simplicity we put @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 which can be rewritten as dynamical system of two variables @xmath18 and @xmath8 : @xmath19 it is clear that all equilibrium points of this system are de sitter points ( ds points ) @xmath20 defined by the next relations @xmath21",
    "it s obvious that there are a lot of ds points in the most general case , but in this paper we will mainly discuss one from its , which is correspond to the minkowski point @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "we denote it ds@xmath24 ( it is clear that for non - vanish values of @xmath13 this point is the nearest to the point @xmath22 ) .",
    "this ds@xmath24 point always exist even in the theories without intrinsic ds points .",
    "for example in quadratic gravity @xmath25 there is no intrinsic ds points , but ds@xmath24 point exist : it mean that there is one ds point ( for non - vanish value @xmath13 ) , which is tend to the minkowski point as @xmath13 tend to zero ( for any @xmath0-theory we have @xmath26 so @xmath27 as @xmath28 ) . in this sense we may study minkowski point as a limit point of ds@xmath24 points set , and interpret @xmath13 as parameter of our theory )",
    "correspond to ds@xmath24 point . ] .",
    "let us apply this idea to the simplest case of quadratic gravity to demonstrate how it works .",
    "thus we put @xmath29 and find from ( [ 1.7 ] ) @xmath30 stability of this point is governed by the characteristic equation @xmath31 where ( all this expressions are true for general case of @xmath0-gravity )    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35 , \\label{1.14}\\ ] ]    and index @xmath36 mean function s value at the studying stationary point , whereas @xmath18 or @xmath8 index mean partial derivative with respect to corresponding variable .",
    "after the quite trivial calculations we find eigenvalues for quadratic gravity model ( [ 1.8 ] ) @xmath37 . \\label{1.15}\\ ] ] we can see from this expression that from @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "so we have @xmath42 as @xmath28 .",
    "it mean that any ds@xmath24 point which is arbitrarily close to minkowski point is stable and therefore we may say that minkowski point is stable also and this result in good agreement with @xcite , where were find that minkowski point is stable in quadratic @xmath0 gravity in _ expanding _ universe ( see below ) .      now let us back to the general case of @xmath0-gravity .",
    "solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) reads @xmath43 , \\label{1.16}\\ ] ] so stability conditions take the form @xmath44 from another hand using ( [ 1.13 ] ) , ( [ 1.14 ] ) and ( [ 1.7 ] ) we find @xmath45 the most number of @xmath0-gravity models apply @xmath2 and @xmath3 to avoid tachyon and ghost instability .",
    "thus we have for exact ds solution @xmath46 , @xmath47 and therefore any ds solution is stable with respect to homogeneous isotropic metric perturbations in expanding universe ( @xmath48 ) .    situation with minkowski solution is not so trivial in the most general case . to discuss minkowski stability problem",
    "let us back to the ds@xmath24 point conception .",
    "we have next relation instead of ( [ 1.16 ] ) @xmath49 , \\label{1.19}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 as @xmath28 .",
    "since we imply @xmath2 and @xmath3 conditions we have a few different possibilities :    * case i @xmath55 as @xmath28 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath56 , so @xmath57 and minkowski solution is stable in the sense which was discussed above . *",
    "case ia @xmath58 as @xmath28 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath59 , so @xmath57 and minkowski solution is stable also . * case ii @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath62\\rightarrow -0 $ ] and @xmath63\\rightarrow -0 $ ] and @xmath64 , so minkowski solution is stable . * case iia @xmath65 .",
    "it s clear that in this case eigenvalues is similar to the previous one , so this case is a special case of the case ii and minkowski solution is stable .",
    "* case iib in the most trivial case @xmath66 both eigenvalues is equal to @xmath67 , so minkowski solution is stable also .    thus we find that in any ghost - free and tachyon - free @xmath0 gravity model minkowski solution is stable with respect to homogeneous isotropic perturbations in expanding universe ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "note that main number of models relate to the class i , for instance @xmath68 , hu - sawicky @xcite , battye - aplleby @xcite or starobinsky models @xcite .",
    "now let us turn to the more general case of homogeneous anisotropic perturbations .",
    "for this task we need to discuss bianchi i metric @xmath69 where functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 are functions of time only .",
    "( it is well known that in gr all first type bianchi metrics can be diagonalized and conserve its form due to einstein equations .",
    "it is also true in @xmath0-gravity , so expression ( [ 3 ] ) is the most general form for bianchi i metric in our case . )",
    "also we introduce hubble parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "only diagonal terms of equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) is nontrivial and @xmath76 component now reads : @xmath77    and for @xmath78 component we have :    @xmath79    for @xmath80 :    @xmath81    for @xmath82 :    @xmath83    so we have some strange situation : the highest derivative is contained in all three equations by the similar way : by the term @xmath84 and therefore @xmath85 ( note here that including of matter in r.h.s . do not change situation ) .",
    "so the system of differential equations is degenerated with respect to highest derivatives .    the interpretation of this fact may be the next .",
    "actually the number of independent variables is _ less _ than 3 . for illustration of this proposition",
    "let us try to transform system ( [ 13])-([16 ] ) .",
    "introducing new variable @xmath86 we find for expression in ( [ 13 ] ) :    @xmath87    so the eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) take the form : @xmath88 from another hand summing eqs .",
    "( [ 14])@xmath89([15])+([16 ] ) we find @xmath90 so we have actually system ( [ 17])-([18 ] ) of two differential equations with two variables instead of system ( [ 14])-([16 ] ) of three equations with three variables .",
    "actually it do not mean that this is final result , because there may be further simplifications and this procedure is well known from the literature @xcite , where was shown how system ( [ 14])-([16 ] ) can be transform to unique equation with one variable , but for our special task it is comfortable to use two variables : @xmath18 and @xmath8 . note one more time : this result is the general one for _ any _ @xmath0-theories in bianchi i ansatz ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "let us consider this result in gr limit @xmath91 , @xmath23 .",
    "we have from eqs .",
    "( [ 17])-([18 ] ) : @xmath92 we can see that situation is absolutely similar to the previous one : system is degenerated .",
    "it means that there is only one independent variable  and this is true result , as we know from kasner solution .",
    "system ( [ 19 ] ) tell us that actually in this case there is only one equation @xmath93 . substituting this back to the system ( [ 19 ] )",
    "we find @xmath94 , which have solution @xmath95 . from this relation",
    "we immediately reproduce one of the kasner expressions @xmath96 .",
    "now let us study solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ 17])-([18 ] ) using dynamical system approach .",
    "first of all we rewrite it as dynamical system :    @xmath97    to investigate stability of some solution @xmath98 of the system ( [ 26 ] ) we linearize it near this solution : @xmath99 where @xmath100 denote the value of partial derivative of function @xmath101 with respect to @xmath18 at the point @xmath98 etc .",
    "characteristic equation for the linearized system ( [ 27 ] ) is : @xmath102 which give us equation for eigenvalues @xmath103 .",
    "it is easy to see that all equilibrium points are determined by the expression @xmath104 .",
    "from another hand we have @xmath105 for _ any _ equilibrium points of the system ( [ 26 ] ) , so actually we have instead of ( [ 28 ] ) : @xmath106 which give us eigenvalues : @xmath107 so stability conditions take the form @xmath108    it is easy to find that all equilibrium points are determined by the next expressions : @xmath109 this expressions are totally identical to ( [ 1.7 ] ) with replacing @xmath110 , so we can see that all equilibrium points are some kind of ds points .",
    "the physical meaning of this points is not quite clear , since we have produce a some manipulations with initial variables , so first of all let us discuss it on the example of power - law function @xmath111 , for which equations may be solved exactly : @xmath112 in the case @xmath113 there is only equilibrium point @xmath114 . for @xmath115 and @xmath116",
    "there are three equilibrium points @xmath98 : @xmath114 , @xmath117^{\\frac{1}{2(1-n)}},[\\alpha(n-2)]^{\\frac{1}{(1-n)}},0)$ ] .",
    "let us discuss the physical meaning of this points .",
    "@xmath118    expression for @xmath8 may be rewritten as @xmath119 thus we have @xmath120 which give us @xmath121 the only possibility to satisfy last expression ( for non - complex values of hubble parameters ) is @xmath122 , which is correspond to the minkowski space .",
    "note also that this point exist for any @xmath0 gravity model with @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125    here we introduce new notation @xmath126^{\\frac{1}{2(1-n)}}$ ] . from ( [ 37 ] )",
    "we have : @xmath127 and using definition of @xmath18 @xmath128 we find the next expression @xmath129 solving this equation with respect to @xmath130 we find discriminant @xmath131 which can not be positive , but vanish at the point @xmath132 .",
    "thus we have @xmath133 which correspond to the usual ds point in expanding universe , and @xmath134 which correspond to the ds point in collapsing universe .",
    "now let us discuss stability conditions ( [ 28.3 ] ) .",
    "it s clear that @xmath135 for any @xmath0 model in expanding universe .",
    "expression for @xmath136 may be rewritten as @xmath137 where @xmath138 and index @xmath36 mean function s value at ds point .",
    "thus we reproduce well known condition ( @xmath139 ) for stability of ds point @xcite . as for ds@xmath24 point",
    "we have situation absolutely similar to the previous one ( isotropic perturbations ) .",
    "so for stability of minkowski space in expanding universe it is enough one of the next conditions in any possible combinations :    * @xmath140 or @xmath141 or @xmath142 as @xmath28 * @xmath143 or @xmath144 or @xmath145 as @xmath28    thus our main conclusion is : minkowski space is asymptotically stable in any tachyon - free ( @xmath3 ) and ghost - free ( @xmath2 ) @xmath0 gravity model in expanding universe with respect to isotropic and basic anisotropic ( homogeneous ) perturbations .",
    "now let us discuss possible influence of higher derivative terms on minkowski stability problem . as the simplest example of such kind of theory we study action in the next form @xmath146+s_m .",
    "\\label{2.1}\\ ] ]    this theory is more complicate then usual @xmath0 gravity model , so we discuss the simplest case of isotropic perturbations only .",
    "we have next additional terms in the left hand side of friedman eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) for flrw metric ( [ 1.3 ] ) ( for more details see @xcite ) @xmath147 so instead of system ( [ 1.6 ] ) we have now    @xmath148    where @xmath149 is the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) .",
    "first of all note , that there is no additional ds - point due to ( [ 2.2])-terms , but this terms may change the stability conditions for ds point ( including ds@xmath24 ) arising from @xmath0-part .",
    "nevertheless in such kind of theory we have @xmath27 as @xmath28 ) as in the previous one . the linearized equation , which governs the stability , at equilibrium point takes the form @xmath150 or @xmath151 with @xmath152 since the finding of general solution of ( [ 2.5 ] ) is a hard task we use routh - hurwitz theorem @xcite which tell us that all solutions of ( [ 2.5 ] ) have a negative real parts ( and therefore equilibrium point @xmath36 is stable ) if and only if satisfy next relations : @xmath153 @xmath154    @xmath155    @xmath156    @xmath157    now let us calculate partial derivatives of @xmath158 .",
    "by using ( [ 1.7 ] ) relations we find    @xmath159    @xmath160    @xmath161    @xmath162    and therefor @xmath163    we can see that ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) are satisfied automatically in expanding universe ( @xmath164 ) , ( [ 2.9 ] ) give us @xmath165 from ( [ 2.10 ] ) we find @xmath166 and ( [ 2.11 ] ) give us @xmath167 in principle by using this inequalities we may verify stability of any ds point for any shape of function @xmath0 , but mainly we are interested in ds@xmath24 point . for this point",
    "as we already mentioned we have @xmath168 as @xmath169 . from another hand",
    "it is well known @xcite that only positive values of @xmath170 give us a ghost free theory .",
    "thus from ( [ 2.17 ] ) we have @xmath171 , from ( [ 2.19 ] ) we have @xmath172 and from ( [ 2.18 ] ) we find @xmath173 ( note also that for negative @xmath170 the last inequality is impossible ) .",
    "this three conditions guarantee us stability of minkowski solution with respect to isotropic perturbations .",
    "we can see that taking into account higher derivative terms may significantly change stability conditions for @xmath0 gravity .",
    "now let us try to apply developed technique to the scalar - tensor gravity model with non - minimal kinetic coupling @xcite    @xmath174 , \\label{3.1}\\ ] ]    where we incorporate @xmath13-term in the action .",
    "equations of motion for flrw metric ( [ 1.3 ] ) take the form @xcite",
    "@xmath175 @xmath176 @xmath177 where eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) is the first integral of ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) .",
    "we can see that this theory have second order equations , it mean that we may exclude @xmath178 from the system without loss of generality .",
    "indeed , multiplying eq .",
    "( [ 3.3 ] ) on @xmath179 , eq . ( [ 3.4 ] ) on @xmath180 , summing and resolving with respect to highest derivative term , we gain the next dynamical system @xmath181 where @xmath18 now is not dynamical variable but parameter depending on @xmath13 and combination @xmath182 was excluded by using ( [ 3.2 ] ) .",
    "equilibrium points of system ( [ 3.5 ] ) are defined by the next relations @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the consequence of ( [ 3.4 ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in minkowski solution ( @xmath185 ) , we need to put also @xmath186 .",
    "eigenvalues @xmath187 of system ( [ 3.5 ] ) may be find from the next equation @xmath188 which have solution @xmath189 , \\label{3.8}\\ ] ] so the necessary and sufficient condition of equilibrium point s stability is @xmath190 and @xmath191 thus we can see that minkowski stability condition in expanding universe ( @xmath164 ) with respect to isotropic perturbations is @xmath192 ( which is quite natural for any true vacuum solution ) , whereas stability of any nontrivial ds solution is governed by ( [ 3.9 ] ) relation , where @xmath193 defined by @xmath194 .",
    "note also that minkowski stability is not depend on sign of @xmath195 parameter and this is the most unexpected result .",
    "in this paper we propose a some universal asymptotic method for investigation stability of minkowski solution in a wide class of modified gravity theories .",
    "the main idea quite simple : we introduce @xmath13-term as parameter and find eigenvalues of ds@xmath24 point .",
    "after that we investigate limit of eigenvalues at @xmath28 .",
    "this allows us to find minkowski stability conditions .",
    "in some cases our method may be much more simple than any another one .",
    "so we hope it will be useful for a number researchers working in this field .",
    "also we have applied our method to the some modified gravity theories and have found new original results ( at least in sec . 3 ) .",
    "so we may conclude , that parameters of some theory , which lead to the instability of minkowski space , are bad and must be excluded from further investigations .",
    "but we need keep in mind the next very important consideration , which have rather philosophical nature .",
    "any our attempts to understand realistic world s picture are based on the our knowledge and we are forced to use our mathematical methodology even in those cases , where it may be not applicable .",
    "so we can say only that such kind of theories must be excluded only from the mathematical point of view , because we just do nt know what the realistic picture is .",
    "there are may be some additional effects ( even not discovered yet ) like some quantum corrections or something else , which can allow realizing of the theories rejected earlier .",
    "the very good demonstration of this fact we can see in the paper : in pure @xmath0 gravity we need @xmath2 and @xmath3 , whereas taking into account higher derivative terms conversely give us @xmath196 and @xmath197 restrictions . in this sense all found in our paper areas of stability must be interpreted as necessary but not enough conditions of stability , which may be changed by additional more complicate effects .",
