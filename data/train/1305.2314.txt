    "the @xmath3cdm model @xcite is well consistent with the present observations , such as the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , the supernovae cosmology project @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , and so on .",
    "however , there are several evidences to challenge the @xmath4cdm model , see the reference @xcite for instance . for example",
    ", evidence has been claimed for the existence of a large - scale bulk flow by surveying the peculiar velocities of the clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the bulk flow points to the direction @xmath5 with the velocity up to @xmath6 at the scale up to @xmath7 . by analyzing the quasar absorption spectra , webb et al . found a large - scale variation of the fine structure constant @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 variation takes the spatial dipole form with a significant @xmath9 .",
    "its direction is close to that of the bulk flow .",
    "in addition , the low multipoles of the cmb power spectrum align to a common direction approximately @xcite .",
    "the direction is also close to that of the bulk flow .",
    "furthermore , antoniou & perivolaropoulos showed a privileged direction @xmath10 for the maximum acceleration of the universe by analyzing the dataset of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the directions mentioned above are close to each other at large scales , even though they origin from different astrophysical ( or cosmological ) observations .",
    "this result could be explained by hidden common systematic effects .",
    "however , it could also stem from one common physical issue .",
    "one possible physical explanation involves one large - scale privileged axis in the space , see reference @xcite .",
    "for example , the anisotropic inflation model predicts a statistically anisotropic primordial power spectrum via a primordial vector field @xcite .",
    "the vector field singles out a privileged direction which influences the evolution of early inflationary phase .",
    "thus , the existence of the spatial privileged axis reveals the possible anisotropy of the spacetime .",
    "another challenge for the @xmath4cdm model involves the observations on bullet clusters @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dark matter hypothesis originated from the observations on galaxy rotation curves .",
    "according to the newtonian gravity , the rotational velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of distance from the center of a galaxy .",
    "however , the observed data often show an asymptotically flat rotation curve out to the furthest data points @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to solve this problem , such as the dark matter @xcite , the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite , the horava ",
    "lifshitz ( hl ) theory @xcite , and so on .",
    "the mond and the hl theory could not also explain the mass discrepancy problem of the bullet clusters .",
    "later , cardone et al . showed that the hl - theory is not in agreement with the observational data @xcite .",
    "seemingly , the issue of galaxy rotation curves is irrelative to the anisotropy of the spacetime .",
    "the reason is that the 3-dimensional space  space rotations are often preserved for the galaxy rotation curves . nevertheless , the time  space rotations ( boosts ) might be violated at the galactic scales .",
    "thus , the galaxy rotation curves could provide a new platform to test the anisotropy of the spacetime . or equivalently ,",
    "the galaxy rotation curves could be explained by the spacetime anisotropy .",
    "finsler geometry gets rid of the quadratic constraint on the finsler structure @xcite .",
    "it admits certain privileged directions in the finsler spacetime and permits less symmetries than the riemann structure @xcite .",
    "thus , finsler geometry is a reasonable candidate to deal with the anisotropic properties of the spacetime .",
    "for example , the finsler spacetime could potentially account for the lorentz violation and the cpt violation @xcite .",
    "the cosmological acceleration could explained by the anisotropic friedmann equation of motion in finsler cosmology @xcite .",
    "the large - scale bulk flow could be explained by a finslerian zermelo navigation model @xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath8 could be revealed by the anisotropic redshift in a randers spacetime @xcite .",
    "similarly , the randers spacetime could also account for the privileged axis of the maximum acceleration in the hubble diagram @xcite .",
    "a spatially anisotropic finslerian model could account for the mass discrepancy problem of the bullet cluster 1e0657 - 558 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a galactic test of the spacetime anisotropy via the galaxy rotation curves ( or an explanation for the galaxy rotation curves in terms of the anisotropic spacetime ) .",
    "we first resolve the gravitational vacuum field equation in the anisotropic finsler spacetime . at the newtonian limit",
    ", we study the geodesic equations for particles cycling a gravitational source .",
    "the result shows that the modified dynamics is similar to that in the newtonian dynamics .",
    "however , the spatial distance acquires certain anisotropic modifications from the finsler structure .",
    "thereafter , we call such a class of anisotropic finsler models as the finslerian mond for convenience .",
    "the reason is that such finsler models have close relations with the milgrom s mond as will be discussed latter . as is mentioned above",
    ", the galaxy rotation curves could be a new platform to test the anisotropy of the spacetime .",
    "the spacetime anisotropy at the galactic scales may be different from that at the large scales .",
    "we will fit the galaxy rotation curves with the finslerian mond to constrain the spacetime anisotropy at such galactic scales .",
    "finally , the scale @xmath1 would be obtained for the occurrence of the possible spacetime anisotropy .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : fmond ] , we give a derivation of the finslerian mond based on finsler gravity . by resolving the finsler gravitational vacuum equation and the finsler geodesic equations , we obtain an anisotropic modification of the spatial distance from the finsler structure . in section [ sec : mmond ] , we make a comparison between the finslerian mond and the milgrom s mond .",
    "we find that the finslerian mond is a kind of mond with the interpolation function @xmath11 different from that of the milgrom s mond .",
    "we use the finslerian mond to fit the observed rotation curve data to constrain the possible occurrence scale for the spacetime anisotropy in section [ sec : mass - profile ] .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finsler geometry is a generalization of riemannian geometry @xcite .",
    "it is based on the so called finsler structure @xmath12 , which is a non - negative real function and has the property @xmath13 for all @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath15 represents the position and @xmath16 represents the velocity , and @xmath17 is the proper time .",
    "the finsler metric is given as @xmath18 the arc length in the @xmath19-dimensional finsler space is given as @xmath20    note that the finsler gravity is covariant although the finsler spacetime admits the anisotropy .",
    "@xcite introduced the gravitational vacuum field equation in finsler space - time in a way first discussed by pirani @xcite , to wit @xmath21 where @xmath22 are called the geodesic spray coefficients @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 is the ricci scalar , which is given by the trace of the ricci curvature tensor @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . in terms of the torsion - free and almost metric - compatible chern connection @xcite @xmath26 the curvature of finsler space",
    "is given as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the formal christoffel symbols of the second kind with the same form of riemannian connection .",
    "@xmath30 in eq.([chern connection ] ) and eq.([finsler curvature ] ) are defined as @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the cartan tensor ( regarded as a measurement of deviation from the riemannian manifold ) .",
    "the geodesic equation in finsler space - time is given as @xcite @xmath33    it should be noted that in the finslerian mond , eq.([field equation ] ) is simply a stipulation @xcite . but its physical significance is very clear . in the geodesic deviation equation @xcite , vanishing of the ricci scalar @xmath23 implies that the geodesic rays are parallel to each other .",
    "this means that it is vacuum outside the gravitational source .",
    "pfeifer & wohlfarth have set up gravitational dynamics for finsler space - time in terms of an action integral on the unit tangent bundle @xcite .",
    "the stipulation @xmath34 here is compatible with their results of gravitational field equation .",
    "the @xmath35-terms can be written as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the coefficients of the cross basis @xmath39 @xcite . considering that @xmath40 and dropping the @xmath35-terms , one can see that @xmath34 is one of the solutions of the above equation . ] .    in finsler geometry ,",
    "the counterpart of the flat space - time in riemann geometry ( i.e. the minkowski space - time ) is called  locally minkowski space - time \" . in a locally minkowski space - time",
    ", @xmath12 depends not on a local coordinate system @xmath41 but just on the induced tangent space coordinates @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 . using eq.([field equation ] ) , one can see that it is a solution of finslerian vacuum field equation .",
    "now let us assume that the metric is close to a locally minkowski one @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 considering that the gravitational field @xmath46 is stationary ( thus all time derivatives of @xmath46 vanishes ) and the particle is moving very slowly ( i.e. @xmath47 ) .",
    "the lowering and raising of indices are carried out by @xmath48 and its matrix inverse @xmath49 .",
    "note that both @xmath50 and @xmath51 contain the spacetime anisotropy .    from the finsler gravitational vacuum equation @xmath34 and",
    "taking into account of the matter , we find that @xmath52 @xmath53 are terms of the same order as @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "one prerequisite for eq.([static field eq1 ] ) is that finsler gravity should reduce to einstein s general relativity if the finsler metric @xmath56 reduces to a riemannian one .",
    "thus we find from eq.([static field eq1 ] ) that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the energy density of the gravitational source and @xmath59 is the gravitational constant in newtonian dynamics .",
    "@xmath60 in eq.([static field eq2 ] ) and eq.([static field eq3 ] ) is given as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the determinant of @xmath63 and  @xmath64 \" denotes the  wedge product \" . here",
    ", we denote the finslerian @xmath65 by @xmath60 , where  @xmath64 \" is the  wedge product \" . for more details",
    "please refer to the book of @xcite . ] .",
    "the solutions of eq.([static field eq2 ] ) and eq.([static field eq3 ] ) are given as @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "we find that the spacetime anisotropy is approximately determined by the locally minkowski metric @xmath68",
    ".    in the newtonian limit , the geodesic equation eq.([geodesic ] ) reduces to @xmath69 eq.([geodesic compo1 ] ) implies that @xmath70 is a function of @xmath71 . since @xmath72 , @xmath70 can be taken as a constant in eq.([geodesic compo2 ] ) .",
    "then we find from eq.([geodesic compo2 ] ) that @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the dynamics of a test particle circling around a static gravitational point source with mass @xmath75 reads @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the circular rotation velocity of the test particle .",
    "eq.([eq : finsler - gravity ] ) implies that the law of gravity in finsler space - time is similar to that in newtonian dynamics .",
    "the only difference is that the spatial distance in minkowski space @xmath78 is now replaced by that in finsler space @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the euclidean metric and @xmath81 is the metric in locally minkowski space .",
    "this is what we expect from finslerian gravity , because the length difference is one of the most distinguishing features of finsler geometry as compared to the riemannian geometry .",
    "the spatial distances in the two different spacetimes can be related by @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a function of @xmath77 and @xmath84 , which depends on the finsler structure @xmath12 , or fundamentally speaking , the symmetry of the finsler space - time .",
    "here , the function @xmath85 characterizes all the possible anisotropy of the spacetime .",
    "it could be constrained by the galaxy rotation curves in section [ sec : mass - profile ] .",
    "when @xmath86 , the spacetime anisotropy vanishes and the finsler spacetime reduces back to the riemann one .",
    "the finslerian gravity eq.([eq : finsler - gravity ] ) includes the milgrom s mond as its special case .",
    "if we take @xmath87 , eq.([eq : finsler - gravity ] ) becomes @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the acceleration , @xmath90 is the interpolation function and @xmath1 is a critical acceleration .",
    "this is simply the milgrom s mond @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath91 is a function of the 3-velocity @xmath77 .",
    "this reveals that the time - space rotations are not preserved in the finslerian mond .    on the other hand , if we choose @xmath92^{-1}$ ] , eq.([eq : finsler - gravity ] ) becomes @xmath93 the value of @xmath94 determines the scale for the occurrence for the spacetime anisotropy . only in the case",
    "@xmath95 , the anisotropy of spacetime becomes significant .",
    "when the parameter @xmath1 vanishes , the finsler mond reduces back to the newtonian dynamics .",

    "eq.([eq : finsler1 ] ) just becomes to eq.([eq : finsler2 ] ) .",
    "for this reason , it is reasonable to call eq.([eq : finsler2 ] ) mond , and we call it the finslerian mond in order to distinguish it from the milgrom s mond",
    ". we plot the different interpolation functions in figure [ fig : interp - function ] .",
    "we can see that the interpolation function used in the finslerian mond model increases much slower than others .",
    "to derive the theoretical rotational velocity in newtonian theory , we should know the mass distribution of a galaxy .",
    "generally , the luminosity mass in a galaxy mainly contains two components : gas ( mainly hi and he ) and stellar disk .",
    "some early type galaxies may also contain a bulge in the center .",
    "however , the mass of the bulge is often much smaller than that of the stellar disk , and we will neglect it for simplicity . because the dark matter has not yet be detected directly , we will not consider it here . since the things ( the hi nearby galaxy survey ) brought an unprecedented level of precision to the measurement of the rotation curves of galaxies , we choose the things galaxies as the samples .",
    "the profile of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) is read directly from the things data cube ( robust weighted moment-0 ) using the task ellint of groningen image processing system ( gipsy)gipsy/. ] .",
    "assuming that hi locates in an infinitely thin disk , we calculate the rotational velocity contributed by hi ( @xmath102 ) directly using the task rotmod of gipsy .",
    "more details of the things galaxies can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the profile of stellar disk is derived from the photometric data .",
    "the surface brightness of the stellar disk can be fitted well by an exponential law @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the scale length and @xmath105 is the surface brightness at the center of galaxy .",
    "the integration of eq.([eq : brightness ] ) gives the total luminosity @xmath106 if we assume that the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath107 ) is a constant for each galaxy and the stellar disk is infinitely thin , the mass profile of the stellar disk can be written as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the central surface mass density .",
    "the total mass of the stellar disk is given by @xmath110 the mass - to - light ratio is given as @xmath111 the luminosity of a galaxy is often represented by its absolute magnitude .",
    "the total luminosity @xmath112 is related to the absolute magnitude @xmath113 as @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the absolute magnitude and the total luminosity of the sun , respectively .",

    "we assume that the mass ratio of he and hi is @xmath123 .",
    "any other gases are negligible compared to hi and he .    in the following discussions , we use eq.([eq : fmond - velocity ] ) and eq.([eq : newton - velocity ] ) to fit the observed rotation curves .",
    "the only two parameters are @xmath124 ( or equivalently @xmath125 ) and @xmath1 .",
    "the sample galaxies used in our paper are the same as that in references@xcite .",
    "these 17 galaxies are the subset of the 34 things galaxies @xcite .",
    "we choose these galaxies because they have smooth , symmetric and high quality rotation curves extending to large distance .",

    "for some galaxies , such as ngc2403 , ngc2841 , ngc2903 , ngc3521 , the theoretical curves of the two mond theories are so close to each other that they seem to overlap .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio obtained from the finslerian mond is often smaller than that from milgrom s mond . for ngc4736",
    ", no solution was found in the finslerian mond fit , and the milgrom s mond fit is extremely poor .",
    "for the gas - rich dwarf galaxy ddo154 , no solution was found in the milgrom s mond fit . in the finslerian mond fit , the critical accelerations @xmath1 for different galaxies shows a fluctuation , but they are all in the order of magnitude @xmath126 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 for ngc2976 is much higher than others .",
    "this may because of the poor quality of the data  the observed velocity extends to only about 3 kpc and shows a trend of decline at the outmost point .",
    "another interesting feature is that the value of @xmath1 for the dwarf galaxies ( such as ngc2366 , ic2574 and ddo154 ) is smaller than that of others .",
    "the average value of @xmath1 ( except for ngc2976 and ddo4736 ) is @xmath127 , which is in good agreement with that of the milgrom s mond . here , @xmath128 m s@xmath129 is the speed of light and @xmath130 @xmath131 is the hubble constant .",
    "most importantly , the magnitude of @xmath1 gives the scale for the occurrence of the spacetime anisotropy .",
    "when the newtonian acceleration @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath1 , the anisotropic effect of the spacetime becomes significant .",
    "the spacetime anisotropy has been tested by physical observations at different scales .",
    "it is related with certain privileged axes in the spacetime . as was mentioned in the introduction",
    ", several evidences were found for the preferred axes at the large scales in the universe , even though their confidence levels are not very significant . on the earth",
    ", the spacetime anisotropy behaves as the lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) and the cpt violation , although the levels of lorentz and cpt violations have been constrained severely , see review in reference@xcite . at the galactic scales , however , the spacetime anisotropy could account for the galaxy rotation curves as was addressed in this paper . or equivalently ,",
    "the galaxy rotation curves give a possible signal to the spacetime anisotropy .",
    "maybe there exist certain different physical effects at the galactic scales from those at other scales .",
    "it is noteworthy that the spacetime anisotropy could be accounted by finsler geometry .",
    "the reason is that the finsler spacetime is intrinsically anisotropic . for the d - dimensional spacetime",
    ", there are only @xmath132 killing vectors in the finsler spacetime .",
    "thus , finsler geometry could be a candidate to deal with issues of the privileged axes in the spacetime .",
    "it should be mentioned that grumiller has derived an effective gravitational potential including a newton term ( @xmath133 ) plus a rindler term ( @xmath134 ) @xcite . according to grumiller s modified gravity , the rotation velocity of a test particle moving in the gravitational potential of a point particle with mass @xmath75 takes the form @xmath135 @xcite , where @xmath136 is the rindler acceleration in order of magnitude @xmath137 m s@xmath138 .",
    "the rindler acceleration may be a constant , or a function of @xmath84 .",
    "in the case of @xmath136 being a constant , it was showed that grumiller s theory can well reproduce the observations in the range @xmath139 kpc , with the rindler acceleration converges to an average value @xmath140 m s@xmath138 @xcite . however , the theoretical curves show a tendency of sharply arising beyond the data range .",

    ", we have already showed that the finslerian mond can well explain the mass discrepancy problem of bullet cluster 1e0657 - 558 , which is a challenge to milgrom s mond @xcite .",

    "another challenge to the milgrom s mond involves the gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "ferreras et al .",
    "studied six strong gravitational lensing early - type galaxies from the castles sample and showed that a significant amount of dark matter is need even in the framework of milgrom s mond @xcite .",
    "they also argued that if the interpolation function @xmath11 increases with @xmath15 slowly enough , the need of dark matter may diminish .",
    "the interpolation function in eq.([eq : interp ] ) happens to satisfy this condition .",
    "thus we may expect that the finslerian mond can explain the gravitational lensing without dark matter .",
