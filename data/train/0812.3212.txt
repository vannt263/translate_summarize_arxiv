    "quite recently , we have constructed a many - body theory for frenkel excitons @xcite similar to the one we have developed for wannier excitons . in these theories , the composite nature of the particles is treated exactly through a set of `` pauli scatterings '' for carrier exchanges between two excitons in the absence of carrier interaction .",
    "exchanges between two or more excitons , which control the many - body physics of these composite particles , are visualized and readily calculated by using a new diagrammatic representation , called `` shiva diagrams '' in relation with their multiarm structure .",
    "alternative approaches which allow one to take into account the pauli exclusion principle in the case of frenkel excitons are based on expressing the fermionic hamiltonian as an infinite series expansion in creation and destruction operators for excitations on atomic sites . in the formalism proposed by agranovich and coworkers @xcite",
    ", these operators obey bosonic commutation rules , while in the method developed by mukamel and coworkers @xcite , the commutation rules for these operators are not bosonic .",
    "the precise forms of the resulting hamiltonian expansions produced by these two approaches also differ from each other .",
    "in contrast to these approaches , the composite boson many - body theory we have constructed @xcite avoids the difficulty of deriving hamiltonian infinite series expansions with an increasing number of operators @xcite , the processes involving any number of excitons being in our formalism treated on the same footing .",
    "this enables us , for the first time in our best knowledge , to self - consistently study interactions between an arbitrary number of frenkel excitons while including the tricky consequence of the pauli exclusion principle in an exact way .",
    "the composite nature of the wannier excitons turns out to be crucial in their many - body physics .",
    "this becomes quite reasonable once we note that the extension of the electron - hole relative motion in an exciton - which is expected to control carrier exchanges - is as large as the scale for coulomb interaction between excitons , this scale being the exciton bohr radius @xmath4 calculated with the semiconductor dielectric constant and the conduction and valence band effective masses .",
    "in contrast , since frenkel excitons are made of electrons and holes on the same atomic site , we could think that , as the extension of their electron - hole relative motion is essentially zero , fermion exchanges between frenkel excitons should reduce to zero ; so that these excitons should behave as elementary bosons . in our previous work on the frenkel",
    "exciton many - body theory @xcite , we have shown that , indeed , the closure relation for @xmath0 frenkel excitons has the same @xmath5 prefactor as the one of @xmath0 elementary bosons , while for wannier excitons , this prefactor is @xmath6 , which is the signature of the fact that wannier excitons are made of two independent fermions .",
    "however , for many other basic properties , frenkel excitons are composite objects definitely .",
    "in particular , they do have pauli scatterings for fermion exchange in the absence of fermion interactions .",
    "these scatterings lead to a normalization factor for @xmath0 identical excitons different from its @xmath7 value for @xmath0 elementary bosons , by a factor @xmath8 which decreases exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "this normalization factor thus exibits the same `` moth eaten '' effect induced by pauli exclusion as the one found for wannier excitons .",
    "fermion exchanges between @xmath0 frenkel excitons are found to be controlled by the dimensionless parameter@xmath9where @xmath3 is the number of atomic sites in the sample .",
    "it is of interest to note that this parameter is actually similar to the dimensionless parameter @xmath10 which controls fermion exchanges between @xmath0 wannier excitons .",
    "indeed , @xmath11 , like @xmath3 , is the maximum number of excitons a sample of volume @xmath12 can accommodate .",
    "let us stress that , while the expression of @xmath13  found for wannier excitons could make us think that the parameter which controls fermion exchanges is linked to the extension @xmath14 of the electron - hole relative motion wave function , the expression of @xmath13 for frenkel excitons rules out this physical understanding - otherwise @xmath13 for these excitons would reduce to zero due to the tight - binding approximation underlying the frenkel exciton concept .",
    "in the present work on frenkel excitons , we are interested in the density dependence of the @xmath0 ground state exciton energy in the born approximation .",
    "we reach this quantity through a procedure similar to the one we have used for wannier excitons , namely we calculate the hamiltonian mean value in a @xmath0 ground state exciton state with momentum @xmath15@xmath16where @xmath17 creates a frenkel exciton with momentum @xmath18 .",
    "let us recall that , while the interacting part of composite quantum particles can not be written as a potential so that a `` zero order state in the exciton interaction '' can not be properly defined , the state @xmath19 plays this role since @xmath20 cancels if we drop all coulomb scatterings between excitons .",
    "as @xmath21 contains coulomb interaction at first order by construction , @xmath22 thus corresponds to the ground state energy of @xmath0 frenkel excitons at first order in coulomb interaction , i.e. , in the born approximation .",
    "we are going to show that , while the @xmath0 exciton normalization factor reads as@xmath23where @xmath8 , calculated in our general paper on the many - body theory of frenkel excitons @xcite , has an expansion in @xmath13 which comes from fermion exchanges and makes it exponentially decrease with @xmath0 , the hamiltonian mean value is found to be _ exactly equal _",
    "to@xmath24@xmath25  comes from the coulomb scattering of just _ two _ excitons due to both direct coulomb processes and indirect coulomb processes , i.e. , the so - called `` electron - hole exchange '' which is the only process responsible for the excitation transfer in the case of frenkel excitons .",
    "( 1.4 ) thus leads to@xmath26@xmath27\\]]this shows that the hamiltonian mean value depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath13 associated to exciton density through a first order term only , corrections being in @xmath28 and @xmath29 ,  but not in @xmath30 .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the hamiltonian mean value for @xmath0 wannier excitons that we have found to expand as @xcite@xmath31 in 3d systems for which the exciton ground state energy is @xmath32where @xmath33 is the exciton rydberg . we have explained the presence of terms in density higher than @xmath13 by saying that , while @xmath34 contains one @xmath35 coulomb process only by construction , interactions between more than two excitons exist through fermion exchanges induced by the composite nature of the particles .",
    "if we now return to frenkel excitons , the reason for the disappearance of high order terms is far from trivial .",
    "while the tight binding approximation underlying the frenkel exciton concept makes most coulomb exchange processes between excitons reducing to zero , this is not enough to explain the result since the denominator of @xmath34 contains a density expansion through @xmath8 .",
    "the fact that @xmath36 does not contain terms in @xmath37  with @xmath38 actually means that similar @xmath37 terms exist in the coulomb part of @xmath34  in order to cancel the @xmath37 terms coming from @xmath8 .",
    "this cancellation is however not mathematically exact since it holds at the order @xmath2 , which indeed reduces to zero in the large sample limit .",
    "it is clear that the proof of such a tricky cancellation must rely on a very precise procedure in which the composite nature of the excitons is treated exactly .",
    "this is why the present work heavily uses the composite boson many - body theory for frenkel excitons we have just constructed paper1,paper2 .",
    "the main results of this theory which is very new , are recalled in section ii for the reader to possibly follow the rest of the argument . in section iii , we start with a simpler two - body problem , namely the calculation of the hamiltonian mean value for @xmath39 frenkel excitons , while in section iv , we turn to arbitrary @xmath0 . this mean value is compared to a similar quantity obtained with excitons replaced by elementary bosons , @xmath34 then only having a first order term in density . in section",
    "v , we conclude .",
    "many - body effects with composite excitons can be derived through a set of four commutators @xcite .",
    "the ones linked to fermion exchanges are obtained from@xmath40 = nb_{0}^{\\dagger n-1}\\sum_{n}\\left\\ { \\lambda \\left ( _ { m\\ i}^{n\\ 0}\\right ) + ( m\\longleftrightarrow n)\\right\\ } b_{n}^{\\dagger }   \\tag{2.1}\\]]@xmath41 = nb_{0}^{\\dagger n-1}\\left ( \\delta _ { m0}-d_{m0}\\right)\\]]@xmath42where definitions of the deviation - from - boson operator @xmath43 and the pauli scattering @xmath44 between two excitons follow from these equations taken for @xmath45 .    in the same way , many - body effects linked to fermion interactions are obtained from @xcite@xmath46 = nb_{0}^{\\dagger n-1}\\sum \\xi \\left ( _ { m\\ i}^{n\\ 0}\\right ) b_{m}^{\\dagger } b_{n}^{\\dagger }   \\tag{2.3}\\]]@xmath47 = nb_{0}^{\\dagger n-1}\\left ( e_{0}b_{0}^{\\dagger } + v_{0}^{\\dagger } \\right)\\]]@xmath48where definitions of the exciton creation potential @xmath49 and the interaction scattering between two excitons  @xmath50 follow from these equations taken for @xmath45 .      in the case of wannier excitons , the index @xmath51 stands for ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) where @xmath52  is the exciton center of mass momentum and @xmath53  a relative motion index . due to the tight binding approximation which in some sense freezes electron on top of hole and makes frenkel excitons constructed on electron and hole on the same atomic site ,",
    "these excitons do not have relative motion index ; so that they only are characterized by a center of mass momentum @xmath18 .",
    "their creation operator @xmath54 reads in terms of free pairs @xmath55 on atomic site @xmath56 as@xmath57where @xmath3 is the number of these atomic sites and @xmath58 their location . in the same way ,",
    "free pairs read in terms of excitons as@xmath59as easy to check from the system periodicity which makes the following equations valid@xmath60@xmath61      the fact that frenkel excitons are only characterized by their center - of - mass momentum , leads to results linked to their many - body exchanges far simpler than the ones for wannier excitons .",
    "in particular , the pauli scattering of two frenkel excitons is structureless : it only contains the expected momentum conservation between the `` in '' excitons ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) and the `` out '' excitons ( @xmath64 , @xmath65)@xmath66more generally , the shiva diagram for carrier exchange between @xmath0 frenkel excitons shown in fig .",

    "we see that the interaction term , which cancels for @xmath45 , as expected , contains all possible coulomb processes between the atomic levels 0 and 1 of the different atomic sites , through the sum over @xmath188 . due to the orhogonality of the @xmath189 atomic states , it is of importance to note that the indirect coulomb processes @xmath190 in which electrons change from atomic state 1 to atomic state 0 are expected to be much smaller than the direct coulomb processes @xmath191 ; so that the interaction term of the hamiltonian expectation value is essentially controlled by direct coulomb processes @xmath84 .",
    "let us however stress that , while these indirect scatterings are not that important in the interaction term of the hamiltonian mean value , they play a major role in the frenkel exciton physics because , although extremely small , they are the only processes allowing an excitation transfer between sites as necessary to produce the exciton .",
    "since the coulomb matrix elements @xmath192 entering the hamiltonian mean value are defined in terms of wave functions for electron in the ground and first excited atomic states , they strongly depend on the chemical properties of the material at hand .",
    "this has to be contrasted with wannier excitons which are constructed on free electrons and free holes , the material of interest just appearing through effective masses induced by the lattice periodicity . for these wannier excitons ,",
    "the intraband coulomb matrix element thus reduces to @xmath193 in 3d . as a result ,",
    "the hamiltonian mean value @xmath34 for these excitons only depends on one input parameter which is the exciton bohr radius ; this is why its @xmath13  expansion can be derived explicitly for all materials ( see eq .",
    "( 1.6 ) ) . in contrast",
    ", the prefactor of the @xmath13  term for frenkel excitons highly depends on the material at hand .    if we now come back to eq .",
    "( 4.18 ) , we can , in the large sample limit , replace @xmath194 by @xmath3 .",
    "so that , for @xmath0 large compared to 1 , the hamiltonian expectation value expands as given in eq .",
    "( 1.5 ) : it only contains a linear term in density . again , this has to be contrasted with @xmath34 for wannier excitons in which the coulomb term reads as a density expansion in @xmath13 .    for completeness ,",
    "let us note that the hamiltonian mean value for @xmath0 identical elementary bosons also has just one linear contribution in density .",
    "this is expectable since the hamiltonian mean value contains the interaction at first order only by construction : when the particles are taken as elementary bosons the @xmath35 interaction couples two bosons among @xmath0 , no fermion exchange exists to possibly mix these two particles with the rest of the system to produce higher order couplings .",
    "this is supported by the precise calculation of the hamiltonian mean value@xmath195which for bosonized excitons such that @xmath196 = \\delta _ { \\mathbf{q}^{\\prime } \\mathbf{q}}$ ] , has a denominator which reduces to @xmath7 while , for an effective bosonic hamiltonian written as@xmath197its numerator follows , since @xmath198 , from@xmath199@xmath200this leads to an hamiltonian mean value given by@xmath201by noting that the scattering @xmath202 must decrease as @xmath203 with the sample volume , as necessary for the extensivity of the system , we see that the correction to the energy of one bosonized exciton just increases linearly with the exciton density @xmath204 .",
    "in this paper , we calculate the ground state energy of @xmath0 frenkel excitons in the born approximation through the hamiltonian mean value in the state made of @xmath0 ground state excitons .",
    "we show that the energy change induced by exciton interactions contains one linear term only in the exciton density , while higher order terms appear in the case of wannier excitons",
    ". a naive reason could be that , since frenkel excitons are constructed on highly localized atomic wave functions , their exchange coulomb scatterings must reduce to zero , making frenkel excitons appearing as elementary bosons .",
    "this however does not hold since the normalization factor of @xmath0 frenkel excitons is exponentially small compared to the one for @xmath0 elementary bosons .",
    "the deep nonobvious reason for having one linear term only in the hamiltonian mean value , is the fact that the same exponentially small prefactor also exists in the coulomb term of the hamiltonian matrix element , within corrections in @xmath2 where @xmath3  is the number of atomic sites .",
    "so that , in the end , all the exchange processes appearing in @xmath36 finally disappear , as if frenkel excitons were true elementary particles , within terms in @xmath2 . here again , shiva diagrams enlighten the physical understanding of the fermion exchanges which lead to this rather unexpected cancellation ."
