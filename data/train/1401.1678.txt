    "among the many open questions in nonequilibrium physics , a central issue is whether thermodynamics can be extended to systems far from equilibrium @xcite . by",
    " thermodynamics \" we mean a macroscopic description employing a small number of variables , capable of predicting the final state of a system following removal of some constraint @xcite .",
    "one expects the set of variables needed to describe a nonequilibrium system to be somewhat larger than required for equilibrium ; it should not , however , involve microscopic details .",
    "thus in near - equilibrium thermodynamics , fluxes of mass , energy , and other conserved quantities enter as relevant variables @xcite .",
    "this approach functions well in the hydrodynamic or local - equilibrium regime ; here , by contrast , we are concerned with systems maintained far from equilibrium .    faced with a vast range of nonequilibrium phenomena , it is natural to focus on the nearest analog to equilibrium thermodynamic states , that is , on nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) , and to analyze the simplest possible examples exhibiting such states , for example , the driven lattice gas @xcite or the asymmetric exclusion process @xcite .",
    "thus sasa and tasaki @xcite , extending the ideas of @xcite , proposed a general scheme of steady state thermodynamics ( sst ) , including definitions of the chemical potential and pressure in ness , and developed a theoretical analysis of the driven lattice gas ; a numerical implementation in driven systems is discussed in @xcite .",
    "more recently , pradhan et al .",
    "@xcite tested , via numerical simulation of driven lattice gases in contact , the consistency of the scheme proposed in @xcite , focussing on the validity of the zeroth law .",
    "these authors find that the zeroth law holds to good approximation , and suggest that observed deviations may be attributed to the nonuniformities induced by the contact itself .",
    "a central notion in sst is that of _ coexistence_. consider two systems , each in a steady state , and weakly coupled to one another , so that they may exchange particles and/or energy .",
    "we say that the systems coexist when the net flux of the quantity or quantities they may exchange is zero .",
    "if the two systems are in equilibrium states , then coexistence corresponds to chemical and/or thermal equilibrium , marked by equality of their respective chemical potentials and temperatures . to construct a sst",
    ", we need to define intensive parameters for ness , such that the value of the parameter associated with particle exchange ( an effective chemical potential , @xmath0 ) is the same when two systems coexist with respect to such exchange , and similarly , an effective temperature , @xmath1 , if the systems coexist with respect to energy exchange .",
    "the definition of intensive parameters for nonequilibrium systems ( such as the zero - range process ) possessing an asymptotic factorization property has been discussed in considerable detail by bertin et al .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider coexistence in classical lattice - gas models . to eliminate inhomogeneities that might otherwise arise , we allow all sites to participate in particle exchange . in driven systems , the rate @xmath2 of exchange attempts is a relevant parameter",
    "; we consider the limit @xmath3 , or the _ weak exchange _ limit .",
    "by contrast , _ virtual exchange _ characterizes the fluxes that would occur , were the systems allowed to exchange particles and/or energy , given their respective stationary states ; nothing is actually transferred .",
    "the difference between virtual exchange and the weak exchange limit is that in the latter case , fluxes are measured in a new stationary state , attained under exchange of particles and/or energy , albeit at a vanishing rate . of course , null currents under virtual exchange is a necessary condition for having null currents ( and so coexistence ) under weak exchange @xcite .    consider a pair of systems a and b , maintained at the same temperature , and free to exchange particles .",
    "when the net flux of particles between the systems is zero , we assert that their chemical potentials @xmath4 and @xmath5 must be equal , if such functions in fact exist .",
    "if one of the systems is a particle reservoir of known chemical potential , we can use the zero - flux condition to measure the chemical potential of the other . with @xmath0",
    "so defined , we stipulate two essential properties it must satisfy , to be a valid chemical potential :    \\1 ) ( zeroth law ) if pairs of systems ( a , b ) and ( a , c ) separately satisfy the zero - flux condition , then , if b and c are allowed to exchange particles , the net flux should also be zero .",
    "\\2 ) if systems a and b , at the same temperature , and initially isolated , with @xmath6 , are permitted to exchange particles , then the ensuing flux should reduce @xmath7 , and should continue until the difference is null .",
    "in other words , knowing the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , of two systems in isolation should allow us to predict the direction of particle transfer when they are placed in contact , and their densities at coexistence .    in the case of athermal lattice gases , the above considerations lead to a dimensionless effective potential @xmath10 equivalent to that defined by sasa and tasaki @xcite ; we show in sec .",
    "iii that this function satisfies the two criteria stated above .",
    "for the lattice gas with nearest - neighbor interactions ( the katz - lebowitz - spohn or kls model ) , one must decide how the rates of particle exchange between systems depend on their respective changes in energy ; even restricting attention to rates satisfying detailed balance , there are many possible choices .",
    "we show that for the familiar metropolis rates , the simplest extension of the approach used in athermal systems does not predict coexistence correctly .",
    "this leads us to define an effective temperature as well as an effective chemical potential for the driven lattice gas .",
    "we shall nevertheless show that such a definition in general leads to violations of the zeroth law .",
    "remarkably , the exchange scheme proposed by sasa and tasaki ( st ) is free of such inconsistencies . using this approach , it is possible to define @xmath11 in a consistent manner , and to predict coexisting densities in the kls model .",
    "the essential difference between st rates and more familiar expressions such as metropolis rates is that in the former , the rate for transferring a particle from system a to system b depends on the change in energy of a , but not on that of b.    the balance of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the kinetics of particle transfers , focussing on the properties of the transition rates .",
    "section iii discusses the application to the nne lattice gas . in sec .",
    "iv , a direct application of the method to the kls model ( involving only the effective chemical potential ) , is shown to fail when metropolis exchange rates are used .",
    "coexistence with respect to particle exchange is correctly predicted using sasa - tasaki rates . in both cases , however , there is a steady flow of energy from the driven to the nondriven system , motivating the definition of an effective temperature .",
    "the consequences of this definition are investigated analytically and numerically in sec .",
    "v. we close in sec . vi with a discussion of the implications of our results for steady state thermodynamics .",
    "since our definitions of intensive parameters on based on stationary averages of fluxes of particles and energy between systems , it seems worthwhile to review briefly the kinetics of particle transfers .",
    "we consider classical stochastic lattice gases , that is , markov processes whose state space corresponds to possible configurations of particles on a lattice or a pair of lattices , and whose evolution is defined by transition rates between certain pairs of configurations .",
    "we denote the transition rate from configuration @xmath12 to @xmath13 by @xmath14 .    in this work",
    "we are concerned with transfers of particles between systems .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be lattice gases characterized by intensive parameters @xmath4 and @xmath17 , and similarly for @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath18 be a configuration of @xmath15 , with energy @xmath19 , and let @xmath20 , with energy @xmath21 , be a configuration of @xmath15 obtained by adding a single particle to @xmath18 .",
    "consider now the composite system @xmath22 , with initial configuration @xmath23 , and let @xmath24 be a configuration of the composite system after transferring a particle from @xmath16 to @xmath15 .",
    "although the systems of interest are not necessarily in equilibrium , we need to include such systems in our description , and shall therefore assume that the transition rates for particle transfers between systems satisfy detailed balance .",
    "that is , if @xmath25 ,    @xmath26 .",

    "all such choices are equivalent insofar as static properties are concerned , and rates can be chosen on the basis of calculational convenience or computational efficiency . out of equilibrium , however , the choice of rates can have very significant effects on stationary and time - dependent behavior .",
    "this holds both for the rates governing the _ internal dynamics _ of a system , and for particle exchanges between systems . in principle",
    ", one would like to have a sst that is valid for any choice of rates .",
    "but we shall see that the consistency condition discussed in the introduction implies a strong constraint on the rates for particle transfers between systems .",

    "thus the rate for particle transfer from @xmath15 to @xmath16 depends exclusively on parameters associated with @xmath15 , and vice - versa .",
    "we shall refer to this important condition as the _",
    "st property_. the class of rates satisfying detailed balance and the st property is unique to within a multiplicative factor , @xmath30 .",
    "the st expression can be seen as resulting from a very high energy barrier @xmath34 between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; the particle first makes a transition from @xmath15 to the barrier , and from there to @xmath16 . in this case the prefactor @xmath35 ; the limit @xmath36 corresponds to the weak exchange limit @xcite .",
    "to begin we examine the lattice gas with nearest - neighbor exclusion ( nne ) . in this model",
    "the pair interaction is infinite if the distance between particles is @xmath37 , and is zero otherwise .",
