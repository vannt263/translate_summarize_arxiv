    "our galaxy is known to host a supermassive black hole ( bh ) with mass @xmath2 at a distance @xmath3  kpc @xcite .",
    "the bh exhibits very low luminosity state probably due to inefficient feeding and cooling .",
    "the bh is fed by stellar winds within several arcseconds from the compact object roughly around the radius of bh gravitational influence @xcite .",
    "the stellar winds are expelled at large speeds .",
    "they collide , heat up to @xmath4  k and emit bremsstrahlung x - rays , observed by chandra @xcite .",
    "a small fraction of mass accretes onto the black hole is thus producing the emission in sub - mm and other wavebands .",
    "however , the inferred accretion rate within several schwarzschild radii is 2 orders of magnitude lower @xcite than the inferred bondi accretion rate @xcite at several arcseconds .",
    "this disparity is resolved in a present work with a point source revealed coincident with sgr a*. a brief account of observations is made in   [ s_obs ] .",
    "the dynamical model is outlined in   [ s_model ] .",
    "the results are discussed in   [ s_res ] .",
    "we analyze @xmath5  ms of chandra exposure of sgr a * and central arcseconds @xcite significantly improving over the previously analyzed @xmath6  ks exposure @xcite . as we are interested in the quiescent emission , we bin the observations in @xmath7  s bins and exclude the flaring states with counts triple the mean .",
    "we also subtract the point sources and extended bright emission zones , thus extracting the quiescent count surface brightness profile within @xmath8 having the extensive data we are able to perform the subpixel spatial binning in rings @xmath9 thickness owing to dithering of spacecraft .",
    "the counts from four @xmath10 ring segments centered at sgr a * are compared in order to test the viability of the radial model .",
    "it appears that within @xmath11 the counts do not differ significantly between ring segments , but the variation was found at @xmath12 the point spread function ( psf ) is extracted by observing the nearby binary j174540.9 - 290014 .",
    "feeding of the black hole should be a starting point of any accretion model .",
    "this approach helps to eliminate a number of arbitrary boundary conditions .",
    "a set of @xmath13 wind emitters is believed to supply almost all the matter into the feeding region of sgr a*. following @xcite , we identify the important wind emitters , find the wind speeds and ejection rates .",
    "we obtain the orbital data from @xcite , assuming the stars either belong to the disk or taken to have the minimum eccentricities . as we are constructing the radial model , the radial feeding function @xmath14 is produced by smoothing wind inputs over radius between the apocenter and the pericenter for each star ( see fig .  [ fig_feed ] ) .",
    "the averaged wind velocity is found as a root - mean - square average over stars weighed with the ejection rate .",
    "we do not account for orbital velocities of stars in energy input as feeding is dominated by only a few stars close to the bh .",
    "s2 star is included into the calculation as it may eject more matter @xcite , than falls onto the bh .",
    "the dynamical model has sources of mass , radial momentum and energy due to winds @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the model is the electron thermal conduction proportional to the temperature gradient with conductivity @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "here we have included the factor of @xmath16 inhibition of conductivity in turbulent magnetic field @xcite .",
    "so computed heat flux appears to be below the saturated flux @xcite . in reality",
    "the inner accretion flow is collisionless and the outer accretion is weakly collisional , however , the single prescription for conductivity gives the reasonable approximation . the realistic behavior of electrons in the inner flow is achieved by using their relativistic heat capacity in the equations of motion , which naturally leads to the ratios @xmath17 up to 10 even in adiabatic flows . for completeness of the theory",
    "we add the direct energy transfer into electrons and protons equivalent to the entropy production , which happens due to viscosity in the rotating flow or due to dissipation of turbulence @xcite .",
    "we assume that the fractions @xmath18 and @xmath19 of available gravitational energy goes to electrons and protons .",
    "the coulomb collisions are included for numerical stability to balance the electron and proton temperature in the outer flow , though they do not have the significant dynamical effect .",
    "the effect of gas composition is accounted for by introducing the effective mass @xmath20 per electron and correspondent reduction in ion gas pressure .",
    "these numbers are taken for the solar abundance of elements , which seems to be reasonable for stellar winds @xcite .",
    "paczhynski - wiita gravitational potential is employed .",
    "the proposed system of equations has no artificial boundary conditions , but it appears to have an unmatched complexity .",
    "we self - consistently solve for the positions of the stagnation point , where gas velocity is zero , and the inner isothermal sonic point @xcite .",
    "the heat flux is set to zero at the point , where @xmath21 in the bondi solution near the bh .",
    "the outer boundary is either taken to be the isothermal sonic point in the outflow or the point with slightly higher density ( for numerical stability ) .",
    "the relaxation technique is used for the 2-temperature system between the inner boundary and the stagnation point , whereas only shooting works outside the stagnation point .",
    "having produced a bunch of dynamical models , we convert the temperature and density radial profiles into the surface brightness profile .",
    "we take the up - to - date bremsstrahlung emissivities ( see @xcite and errata ) and account for emission by heavy elements , excluding iron .",
    "we calculate the spectrum along each ray and convert it to counts by applying the solar metallicity interstellar absorption @xcite with hydrogen column @xmath22@xmath23 and convolving with the response of chandra .",
    "then we apply the psf blurring and compare with the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "the outer surface brightness profile can be reasonably fitted by a model with @xmath24 @xmath25 which also leads to the ratio @xmath26 near the bh .",
    "however , we find that the inner part of surface brightness curve is too steep for any extended emission .",
    "there should be a point source in the center accounting for @xmath27 to @xmath28 of central surface brightness and having the unabsorbed luminosity about @xmath29  erg / s of monoenergetic @xmath30  kev photons .",
    "about the same luminosity is expected from the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process near the bh .",
    "the search for the best model with the point source continues .",
    "we want the best model to reproduce the observed faraday rotation measure @xmath31@xcite and optically thick flux @xmath32  jy at @xmath33  ghz @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude consistency is achieved on the way .",
    "the accretion rate appears to be self - consistently limited to @xmath34 of bondi value , thus the connection between the inner accretion flow and the outer accretion flow is established .",
    "the future versions will include the angular momentum and use x - ray spectral information .",
