    "quantum size oscillations , shape resonances , and sizable amplification of the superconducting critical temperature have been experimentally confirmed and theoretically analyzed in metallic aluminum and tin nanowires of cylindrical shape @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the authors of ref.@xcite predicted a strong renormalization of the chemical potential and the possibility of the complete condensation of all the electrons of the subband in which the chemical potential is close to its energy bottom , giving rise to the coexistence of bcs - like and bec - like pairs .",

    "more recently , the discovery of the mgb@xmath0 superconductor and of the different families of iron - based superconductors definitely opened a new field of investigation in condensed matter physics : the multicomponent ( or multigap / multiband ) superconductivity @xcite ( see also the web portal of the international network on multi - component superconductivity and superfluidity : http://www.multisuper.org ) . for iron - based superconductors the central role played by one of the bands being in the bcs - bec crossover",

    "moreover , the presence of one band in the bcs - bec crossover was predicted to be a key feature for diverse high temperature superconductors in ref.@xcite .",
