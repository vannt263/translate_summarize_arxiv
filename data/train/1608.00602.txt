    "in the theory of compact stars @xcite there are still several key unanswered questions @xcite .",
    "one of them is : `` are there quark stars ? '' this question has been around for decades and it has received a renewed attention after the appearance of new measurements of masses of astrophysical compact objects @xcite .",
    "these measurements suggest that stellar objetcs may have large masses , such as , for example , the pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 , with @xmath0 @xcite or the pulsar psr j0348 + 0432 , with @xmath1 @xcite and perhaps the black widow pulsar psr b1957 + 20 , with a possible mass around @xmath2 @xcite . in principle",
    "larger masses imply larger baryon densities in the core of the stars and we expect very dense hadronic matter to be in a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase . on the other hand , from the theoretical point of view , most of the proposed equations of state for this cold qgp are too soft to be able to support such large masses .",
    "the answer to the question above depends on the details of the equation of state of cold quark matter .",
    "according to most models , deconfined quark matter should be formed at baryon densities in the range @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ordinary nuclear matter baryon density . since at low temperatures and high baryon densities we can not rely on lattice qcd calculations ,",
    "the quark matter equations of state must be derived from models .",
    "many of them are based on the mit bag model @xcite or on the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite . in these models",
    "the gluon degrees of freedom do not appear explicitly . in the bag model",
    "they are contained in the bag constant and in the njl they are integrated out giving origin to the four - quark terms . in more recent version of the njl model @xcite a bag - like term",
    "was introduced to represent the contribution of gluons to the pressure and energy density . at very high baryon densities there are constraints derived from perturbative qcd calculations @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite we have developed a quark - gluon eos , which was applied to the calculation of the structure of compact quark stars in ref .",
    "stars as heavy as @xmath5 were found .",
    "one important ingredient in the stellar structure calculation is the magnetic field . in magnetars ,",
    "the strength of this field can reach values as large as @xmath6 . in theoretical calculations ,",
    "magnetic field effects in astrophysical compact objects have been well studied @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the equation of state derived in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case where we have strong magnetic fields and check whether it is still able to support massive stars .",
    "some steps along this direction have already been taken in ref .",
    "the equation of state derived in @xcite is based on a few assumptions .",
    "first we assume , as in the case of the hot qgp observed in heavy ion collisions , that the quarks and gluons in the cold qgp are deconfined but `` strongly interacting '' , forming a strongly interacting qgp ( sqgp ) .",
    "this means that the coupling is not small and also that there are remaining non - perturbative interactions and gluon condensates .",
    "of course , at very large densities ( in the same way as at very high temperatures ) the sqgp evolves to an ideal gas of non - interacting particles in a trivial vacuum .",
    "we split the gluon field into two components @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ( `` soft '' gluons ) and @xmath9 ( `` hard''gluons ) are the components of the field associated with low and high momentum respectively .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are non - vanishing in a non - trivial vacuum and from them we obtain an effective gluon mass ( @xmath12 ) and also a contribution ( @xmath13 ) to the energy and to the pressure of the system similar to the one of the mit bag model . since the number of quarks is very large and their coupling to the gluons",
    "is not small , the high momentum levels of the gluon field will have large occupation numbers and hence the @xmath9 component of the field can be approximated by a classical field .",
    "this is the same mean field approximation very often applied to models of nuclear matter , such as the walecka model .    in the next subsection we review the main formulas . for the details of the derivation we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider a system of deconfined quarks and gluons in a non - trivial vacuum immersed in an homogeneous magnetic field oriented along the cartesian @xmath14 direction ( we employ natural units @xmath15 and metric given by @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 the lagrangian is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 refer to the quarks and electrons which interact with the external magnetic field .",
    "the electrons are necessary to ensure the charge neutrality of the star , which will be enforced as in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ prelagra ] ) can be written as : @xmath21\\psi_{j}^{f}\\ ] ] @xmath22\\psi_{j}^{e } -{\\frac{1}{16\\pi}}f_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu } \\label{lqcduagain}\\ ] ] where the first and second lines represent the qcd and qed parts respectively .",
    "the summation in @xmath23 runs over the quark flavors : up ( @xmath24 ) , down ( @xmath25 ) and strange ( @xmath26 ) , which have the following masses : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "( [ lqcduagain ] ) and in what follows , we do not include the interaction terms between the magnetic field and the fermion magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "this is because in ref . @xcite it was shown that for strange quark matter in @xmath76 equilibrium in magnetic fields weaker than @xmath6 the contribution of these terms can be neglected .",

    "we compute the values for the baryon density @xmath106 as multiples of the usual nuclear matter @xmath107 .",
    "we remember that when @xmath108 we recover the result of the mit bag model . in this case we do not consider the electrons and just focus on the pure qcd matter , varying the baryon density from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ eoss ] for the parallel and perpendicular pressures .",
    "we have chosen @xmath111 , @xmath112 and varied the magnetic field from zero to @xmath113 . as can be seen in the figure",
    "there are no causality violations ( in which case we would have @xmath114 ) . the parallel pressure ( fig .",
    "[ eoss]a ) decreases as the magnetic field increases , while the perpendicular pressure ( fig .",
    "[ eoss]b ) increases with the magnetic field . up to the considered maximum value of the magnetic field ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath115 and @xmath116 with @xmath117 is very mild .",
    "moreover they are almost equal to each other .",
    "however at higher values of the magnetic field there is a rapid splitting between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ split ] . at @xmath118",
    "the difference between the two pressures is not yet very pronounced ( less than 10 % ) and the spherical symmetry can still be used to derive the standard tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ split ] are compatible with those shown in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite and also with those shown in fig . 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quark matter was represented by slightly different versions of the mit bag model equation of state .",
    "the main difference is that , while in these works the pressure anisotropy starts at @xmath119 g , in our calculations it starts earlier , at @xmath120 g. this happens because of the term proportional to @xmath121 appearing in the energy density ( [ epsilontempzeromagon ] ) and in the pressure ( [ parallelpressureaalmendfinaltzero])-([perppressuerendtzero ] ) , which depends quadratically on @xmath117 , as can be seen from ( [ rhoquarksfromomegaendtzero ] ) .",
    "this term anticipates the high @xmath117 behavior of the pressure and the appearance of the pressure anisotropy .    at this point",
    "a remark is in order . as discussed in detail in @xcite",
    ", there is a controversy in the literature concerning the existence or non - existence of pressure anisotropies . in early works",
    "( see the references quoted in @xcite ) it was explicitly demonstrated that , in the presence of a background magnetic field , a fermi - gas of spin - one - half particles possesses a pressure anisotropy .",
    "later the calculations were revisited and the effects of the anomalous magnetic moment were included .",
    "it was concluded that the pressure anisotropy exists for both charged and uncharged particles , with and without anomalous magnetic . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently in @xcite it was argued that , due to the presence of a non - vanishing magnetization one needed to additionally take into account the lorentz force of the external magnetic field on the bound current densities , which would lead the system to isotropization . while this question is certainly very interesting we will stay on the safe side , avoid the region of very high @xmath117 and consider only values of the magnetic field where the pressure is isotropic .",
    "more precisely , in what follows we will compute the star masses up to @xmath118 using the two different pressures and interpret the results as upper and lower limits of our calculations , regarding their difference as a theoretical error .",
    "we wish to study stellar models with stable strange quark matter ( described by the mqcd equation of state ) and hence we will impose the stability conditions .",
    "the first condition is the existence of chemical equilibrium in the weak processes involving the quarks @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and electrons @xcite : @xmath122 @xmath123 which provides the following relations among the chemical potentials : @xmath124 the second condition is the global charge neutrality enforced by : @xmath125 the third condition is the baryon number conservation , which implies that @xcite : @xmath126 the last condition is the requirement that the energy per baryon must be lower than the infinite baryonic matter defined in @xcite and higher than the two flavor quark matter at the ground state @xcite . we must impose that @xcite : @xmath127    we find numerically the values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 which satisfy ( [ ce ] ) to ( [ stable ] ) simultaneously . some examples of stability regions in the @xmath130 parameter space are presented in fig .",
    "[ figstablewindows1 ] , where the regions defined by the curves are the `` stability windows '' of @xmath128 as a function of @xmath129 .",
    "we observe that increasing the baryon density the window `` shrinks '' , i.e. , the stability area becomes smaller and thinner .",
    "there is a maximum baryon density , @xmath131 , beyond which there is no stability window .",
    "this was expected and could be anticipated by looking at the first term of eq .",
    "( [ epsilontempzeromagon ] ) .",
    "when @xmath132 grows this term becomes dominant and the ratio @xmath133 grows in such a way that it can no longer satisfy the left inequality in ( [ stable ] ) .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the value of the magnetic field . from ( [ epsilontempzeromagon ] )",
    "we can infer that there is a value of @xmath117 , beyond which there will be no stability .    in fig .",
    "[ stabquali ] we show the diagram of stability as function of the magnetic field for the mqcd equation of state . from the figure we can observe that there is a maximum values of @xmath132 and of the field @xmath117",
    ", beyond which there is no stability .",
    "as usual , to describe the structure of a static and non - rotating compact star , the einstein equations are solved for the spherical , isotropic , static and general relativistic ideal fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium . under these conditions ,",
    "the solution of the einstein equations provides the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation for the pressure @xmath134 : @xmath135 \\left [ 1 + \\frac{4\\pi r^3 p(r)}{m(r ) } \\right ] \\times \\left [ 1 - \\frac{2gm(r)}{r } \\right]^{-1 } , \\label{tovagain}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 is the newton gravitational constant .",
    "the mass @xmath137 of the compact star is given by the mass continuity equation : @xmath138    in general , magnetic fields tend to deform a star and for larger magnetic fields , there will be a large deformation caused by changes in the metric inside the star .",
    "this aspect has been well studied in the literature , as for example , in @xcite . in these situations , where the magnetic fields are of the order of @xmath139 , the use of the spherically symmetric tov equations to study the star structure is not appropriate .",
    "therefore we will restrict our study to fields up to @xmath140 .",
    "we solve numerically the coupled nonlinear equations ( [ tovagain ] ) and ( [ massagain ] ) for @xmath134 and @xmath137 , in order to obtain the mass - radius diagram . the possible magnetic field effects in the stellar structure come from the eos .",
    "we consider the central energy density @xmath141 and then we integrate both ( [ tovagain ] ) and ( [ massagain ] ) from @xmath142 up to @xmath143 ( stellar radius ) , where the pressure at the surface is zero : @xmath144 .    in fig .",
    "[ tovcomp ] we present some solutions of the tov equations and the resulting mass - radius diagrams .",
    "we fix @xmath129 , @xmath128 and @xmath132 respecting the stability windows and consider two values for the magnetic field . from the figure we observe that the mqcd model predicts larger masses than the mit one and also that all values of the magnetic field , from zero to @xmath145 , yield the same mass - radius curves . in this range of @xmath117 values",
    "the parallel and perpendicular pressures are equal .",
    "one of main conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite was that , with the eos provided by mqcd , it was possible to have strange quark stars with two ( or more ) solar masses . the purpose of the calculations presented in fig .",
    "[ tovcomp ] is to show that this remains true for strong magnetic fields .    in fig .",
    "[ tov5x10a17 ] we show how the mass - radius curves change when we keep the magnetic field constant and change @xmath129 and @xmath128 .",
    "we solve the equations ( [ tovagain ] ) and ( [ massagain ] ) using the parallel and perpendicular pressures , given respectively by ( [ parallelpressureaalmendfinaltzero ] ) and ( [ perppressuerendtzero ] ) .",
    "as expected , smaller values of @xmath129 imply higher pressure and higher masses , as we can see in fig .",
    ". a larger value of @xmath128 increases the pressure and the values of the obtained masses , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tov5x10a17]b .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with those found in @xcite at zero magnetic field . at @xmath146 g",
    "there is a visible difference between the results obtained with parallel and perpendicular pressures .",
    "this is the point where we stop our calculations and the difference between the results obtained with @xmath115 and @xmath116 give an estimate of our theoretical error .",
    "however , if we insist on solving the tov equations even for values of @xmath117 for which the pressure is anisotropic , we obtain the masses shown in fig .",
    "[ behavior ] . comparing with fig .",
    "[ split ] , we observe that there is a direct correspondence between pressure and star mass . under the same change of @xmath117 ( from @xmath147 to @xmath148 gauss ) the pressures and masses change by a similar amount of @xmath149 % or less .",
    "we have evaluated the equation of state derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ( which we call mqcd ) at very large baryon densities , where deconfined quark matter should exist . in our model",
    "the ideal gas behavior is reached in the limit @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( respecting the condition @xmath153 ) . in this limit",
    "we obtain the stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) equation of state .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that the sb limit is not yet reached at chemical potentials in the range @xmath154 . in our model",
    "this means that the pressure is lowered ( with respect to the sb value ) because the quarks have non - zero masses or because of a non - vanishing gluon condensate or because of the two reasons combined .",
    "we have introduced the magnetic field in the mqcd equation of state .",
    "we observe the splitting of the pressure into parallel , @xmath115 , and perpendicular , @xmath116 , pressures .",
    "when @xmath117 increases , @xmath116 increases whereas @xmath115 decreases . in our model",
    "this splitting starts to happen when @xmath120 g and it is a modest effect until @xmath155 g. since larger pressures are essential to generate stars with larger masses , it is not clear a priori what is the effect of the magnetic field on the mass of the star .",
    "moreover , increasing @xmath117 the stability window shrinks and from @xmath156 g on , we can not find any stable quark star . at these values",
    "the difference between @xmath115 and @xmath116 is so large that we should no longer use the standard spherically symmetric tov equations .",
    "even though it was not possible to determine a clear trend of mass - radius curves with the magnetic field , we could find stars with more than two solar masses at @xmath157 .",
    "from this we can conclude that the heavy and magnetized stellar objects mentioned in the introduction can be , among other possibilities , quark stars .",
    "to summarize : in our model the magnetic field does not generate any noticeable effect until @xmath147 g. from this point on , it generates a pressure anisotropy which precludes the use of the tov equations .",
    "moreover , it rapidly increases the energy density closing the stability window for this kind of strange quark matter .",
    "in this appendix we present some details of the derivation of eqs .",

    "<S> some time ago we have derived from the qcd lagrangian an equation of state ( eos ) for the cold quark matter , which can be considered an improved version of the mit bag model eos . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the latter , our equation of state reaches higher values of the pressure at comparable baryon densities . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is due to perturbative corrections and also to non - perturbative effects . </S>",
    "<S> later we applied this eos to the study of compact stars , discussing the absolute stability of quark matter and computing the mass - radius relation for self - bound ( strange ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> we found maximum masses of the sequences with more than two solar masses , in agreement with the recent experimental observations . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we include the magnetic field in the equation of state and study how it changes the stability conditions and the mass - radius curves . </S>"
