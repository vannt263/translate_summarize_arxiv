    "the main asteroid belt , the trans - neptunian belt , and the oort cloud are considered to be the main sources of the objects that could collide with the earth .",
    "about 0.4% of the encounters within 0.2 au of the earth are from periodic comets ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/closeapp.html ) , and 6 out of 20 recent approaches of comets with the earth within 0.102 au were due to periodic comets ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/closestcomets.html ) .",
    "the fraction of close encounters with the earth due to active comets is @xmath31% .",
    "reviews of the asteroid and comet hazard were given by ipatov ( 2000 , 2001 ) , and bottke et al .",
    "many scientists , e.g. bottke et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , believe that asteroids are the main source of near - earth objects ( neos , i.e. objects with perihelion distance @xmath4@xmath51.3 au )",
    ". however , shoemaker _",
    "( 1994 ) argued that active and extinct periodic comets may account altogether for about 20% of the production of terrestrial impact craters larger than 20 km in diameter .",
    "there are about 40 active and 800 extinct earth - crossing jupiter - family comets with period @xmath6@xmath520 yr and nuclei @xmath7 1 km , and about 140270 active earth - crossing halley - family comets ( @xmath8 yr ) .",
    "duncan et al . (",
    "1995 ) and kuchner ( 2002 ) investigated the migration of trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) to neptune s orbit , and levison and duncan ( 1997 ) studied the migration from neptune s orbit to jupiter s orbit .",
    "ipatov and hahn ( 1999 ) considered the migration of 48 jupiter - crossing objects ( jcos ) with initial orbits close to the orbit of comet p/1996 r2 and found that on average such objects spend @xmath3 5000 yr in orbits which cross both the orbits of jupiter and earth . using these results and additional orbit integrations , and assuming that there are @xmath9 1-km tnos with 30@xmath5@xmath10@xmath550 au ( jewitt and fernandez , 2001 ) ,",
    "ipatov ( 2000 , 2001 ) found that about @xmath11 1-km former tnos are",
    "jupiter - crossers now and 10 - 20% or more 1-km earth - crossers could have come from the edgeworth - kuiper belt into jupiter - crossing orbits .",
    "note that previous estimates of the number of bodies with diameter @xmath12 km and 30@xmath13@xmath14@xmath1550 au were larger : @xmath16 ( jewitt _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) and @xmath17 ( jewitt , 1999 ) .",
    "in the present paper we use the estimates by ipatov ( 2001 ) , but now include a much larger number of jcos .",
    "preliminary results were presented by ipatov ( 2002 , 2003a - b ) , who also discussed the formation of tnos and asteroids .",
    "as the actual collisions of migrating objects with terrestrial planets are rare , we use an approximation of random phases and orientations to estimate probabilities of collision for families of objects with similar orbital elements .",
    "we suppose that their semi - major axes @xmath10 , eccentricities @xmath18 and inclinations @xmath0 are fixed , but the orientations of the orbits can vary . when a minor body collides with a planet at a distance @xmath19 from the sun , the characteristic time to collide , @xmath20 , is a factor of @xmath21 times that computed with an approximation of constant velocity , where @xmath22 is the velocity at the point where the orbit of the body crosses the orbit of the planet , and @xmath23 is the velocity for the same semi - major axis and a circular orbit .",
    "this coefficient @xmath24 modifies the formulas obtained by ipatov ( 1988 , 2000 ) for characteristic collision and close encounter times of two objects moving around the sun in crossing orbits .",
    "these formulas also depend on the synodic period and improve on pik s formulas when the semi - major axes of the objects are close to each other . as an example , at @xmath18=0.7 and @xmath10=3.06 au , we have @xmath24=2.26 .",
    "based on these formulas , we calculated probabilities ( 1/@xmath20 ) for @xmath3 1300 neos , including 343 venus - crossers , 756 earth - crossers and 1197 mars - crossers .",
    "the values of @xmath20 ( in myr ) , @xmath24 , and the number @xmath25 of objects considered are presented in table 1 .",
    "we considered separately the atens , apollos , amors , and several jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) .",
    "the relatively small values of @xmath20 for atens and for all neos colliding with the earth are due to several atens with small inclinations discovered during the last three years .",
    "if we increase the inclination of the aten object 2000 sg344 from @xmath0=@xmath26 to @xmath0=@xmath27 , then for collisions with the earth we find @xmath28=28 myr and @xmath24=0.84 for atens and @xmath28=97 myr and @xmath24=1.09 for neos .",
    "these times are much longer , and illustrate the importance of rare objects .",
    "as the next step in estimating probabilities , we calculated the orbits for thousands of test particles with orbits similar to known comets and asteroids , but having slightly different initial conditions .",
    "the results confirm that most of the collision probability comes from a handful of very rare cases in which the test particle is earth - crossing for an extended period of time .",
    "they also show that the initial conditions matter more than the choice of orbit integrator .    for initial investigations of the migration of bodies under the gravitational influence of the planets",
    ", we used the integration package of levison and duncan , 1994 . in most cases we omitted the influence of mercury and pluto . here and in tables 2 - 3 and figs . 1 , 2a - c , 3 - 5 we present the results obtained by the bulirsh - stoer method ( bulsto code ; bulirsh and stoer , 1966 ) with the integration step error less than @xmath39@xmath40[@xmath41-@xmath42 , and in the next section we compare them with those of bulsto with @xmath39@xmath13@xmath43 and a symplectic method .",

    "initial orbits were close to those of a single comet ( 2p , 9p , 10p , 22p , 28p , or 39p ) .",
    "for the 2p runs , we included mercury in the integrations .",
    "we also investigated the orbital evolution of asteroids initially moving in the 3:1 and 5:2 resonances with jupiter .",
    "for the jcos we varied only the initial mean anomaly @xmath55 .",
    "the number of objects in one run usually was @xmath13250 .",
    "in most jco cases the time @xmath56 when perihelion was passed was varied with a step @xmath57@xmath131 day ( i.e. , @xmath55 was varied with a step @xmath5@xmath58 ) . near the @xmath56",
    "estimated from observations , we used smaller steps . in most jco cases the range of initial values of @xmath56 was less than several tens of days . for asteroids , we varied initial values of @xmath55 and the longitude of the ascending node from 0 to 360@xmath59 .",
    "the approximate values of initial orbital elements are presented in table 2 .",
    "we initially integrated the orbits for @xmath60@xmath710 myr .",
    "after 10 myr we tested whether some of remaining objects could reach inside jupiter s orbit ; if so , the calculations were usually continued .",
    "therefore the results for orbits crossing or inside jupiter s orbit were the same as if the integrations had been carried to the entire lifetimes of the objects .",
    "for comet 2p and resonant asteroids , we integrated until all objects were ejected into hyperbolic orbits or collided with the sun . in some previous publications",
    "we have used smaller @xmath60 , so these new data are more accurate .    in our runs , planets were considered as material points so literal collisions did not occur . however , using the formulas of the previous section , and the orbital elements sampled with a 500 yr step , we calculated the mean probability @xmath6 of collisions .",
    "we define @xmath6 as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the probability for all @xmath63 objects of a collision of an object with a planet during its lifetime , the mean time @xmath28=@xmath64 during which perihelion distance @xmath4 of an object was less than the semi - major axis @xmath65 of the planet , and the mean time @xmath66 during which an object moved in jupiter - crossing orbits .",

    "the results showed that most of the probability of collisions of former jcos with the terrestrial planets is due to a small ( @xmath30.1 - 1% ) fraction that orbited for several myr with aphelion @xmath74@xmath54.7 au .",

    "note that even for different @xmath97 the data presented in tables 2 and 5 usually are similar . as we did not calculate collision probabilities of objects with planets by direct integrations , but instead calculated them with the random phase approximation from the orbital elements , we need not make integrations with extremely high accuracy . ipatov ( 1988b ) showed that for bulsto the integrals of motion were conserved better and the plots of orbital elements for closely separated values of @xmath39 were closer to one another with @xmath113@xmath13@xmath136@xmath13@xmath115 .",

    "small @xmath39 is clearly necessary for close encounters .",

    "for a symplectic method it is better to use smaller @xmath102 at a smaller distance @xmath19 from the sun , but in some runs @xmath19 can vary considerably during the evolution .",
    "according to duncan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the fraction @xmath145 of tnos reaching jupiter s orbit under the influence of the giant planets in 1 gyr is 0.8 - 1.7% .",
    "as the mutual gravitational influence of tnos can play a larger role in variations of their orbital elements than collisions ( ipatov , 2001 ) , we considered the upper value of @xmath145 . using the total of @xmath9 1-km tnos with @xmath146@xmath5@xmath10@xmath5@xmath147 au , and assuming that the mean time for a body to move in a jupiter - crossing orbit is 0.12 myr , we find that about @xmath148=@xmath11 1-km former tnos are now jupiter - crossers , and 3000 are jupiter - family comets .",
    "using the total times spent by 7350 ( not including our 2p runs ) and 7852 simulated jcos in various orbits , we obtain the following numbers of 1-km former tnos now moving in several types of orbits :    @xmath149@xmath63@xmath33ieos@xmath33aten@xmath33al2@xmath33apollo@xmath33amor@xmath347350@xmath1507852@xmath151    for example , the number of ieos @xmath152=@xmath153/@xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the total time during which @xmath156 former jcos moved in ieo orbits , and @xmath157 is the total time during which @xmath156 jcos moved in jupiter - crossing orbits .",
    "as we considered mainly the runs with relatively high migration to the earth , the actual above values are smaller by a factor of several , the actual portion of ieos and atens can be smaller and that for amors can be larger than those for our runs . even if the number of apollo objects is an order of magnitude smaller than the above value , it may still be comparable to the real number ( 750 ) of 1-km earth - crossing objects ( half of them are in orbits with @xmath10@xmath52 au ) , although the latter number does not include those in highly eccentric orbits .",
    "the values of the characteristic time ( usually @xmath72 ) for the collision of a former jco or a resonant asteroid with a planet ( see tables 2 and 5 ) are greater than the values of @xmath20 for neos in table 1 , @xmath72@xmath901.1 gyr for 7852 objects , so we expect that the mean inclinations and eccentricities of unobserved neos are greater than those for the neos that are already known .",
    "jedicke et al . , ( 2003 ) found similar results . on average , the values of @xmath72 for our @xmath53 series and for most of our simulated jcos were not greater than those for our calculated asteroids , and migrating earth - crossing objects had similar @xmath18 and @xmath0 for both former jcos and resonant asteroids ( see e.g. fig .",
    "former jcos , which move in earth - crossing orbits for more than 1 myr , while moving in such orbits , usually had larger @xmath6 and smaller @xmath18 and @xmath0 ( sometimes similar to those of the observed neos , see figs . 1 - 2 ) .",
    "it is easier to observe orbits with smaller values of @xmath18 and @xmath0 , and probably , many of the neos moving in orbits with large values of @xmath18 and @xmath0 have not yet been discovered .",
    "about 1% of the observed apollos cross jupiter s orbit , and an additional 1% of apollos have aphelia between 4.7 - 4.8 au , but these jupiter - crossers are far from the earth most of time , so their actual fraction of ecos is greater than for observed ecos .",
    "the fraction of earth - crossers among observed jupiter - family comets is about 10% .",
    "this is a little more than @xmath158 for our @xmath53 runs , but less than for 7850 jcos . for our former resonant asteroids",
    ", @xmath66 is relatively large ( @xmath900.2 myr ) , and such asteroids can reach cometary orbits .",
    "comets are estimated to be active for @xmath159@xmath11 yr .",
    "some former comets can move for tens or even hundreds of myr in neo orbits , so the number of extinct comets can exceed the number of active comets by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the mean time spent by encke - type objects in earth - crossing orbits is about 0.4 myr .",
    "this time corresponds to 40 - 400 extinct comets of this type .",
    "note that the diameter of comet 2p encke is about 5 - 10 km , so the number of smaller extinct comets can be much larger .",
    "the above estimates of the number of neos are approximate .",
    "for example , it is possible that the number of 1-km tnos is several times smaller than @xmath9 , while some scientists estimated that this number can be up to @xmath17 .",
    "also , the fraction of tnos that have migrated towards the earth might be smaller .",
    "on the other hand , the above number of tnos was estimated for @xmath10 @xmath5 50 au , and tnos from more distant regions can also migrate inward .",
    "the oort cloud could also supply jupiter - family comets . according to asher et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the rate of a cometary object decoupling from the jupiter vicinity and transferring to an neo - like orbit is increased by a factor of 4 or 5 due to nongravitational effects ( see also fernandez and gallardo , 2002 ) .",
    "this would result in larger values of @xmath67 and @xmath28 than those shown in tables 2 and 5 .",
    "our estimates show that , in principle , the trans - neptunian belt can provide a significant portion of the earth - crossing objects , although many neos clearly came from the main asteroid belt",
    ". it may be possible to explore former tnos near the earth s orbit without sending spacecraft to the trans - neptunian region .",
    "more than half of the close encounters of active comets with the earth belong to long - period comets , which amount to about 80% of the known population .",
    "thus , though probabilities are smaller for larger eccentricities , the number of collisions of both long - period and short - period active comets with the inner planets can be of the same order of magnitude . according to our results , many former jupiter - family comets can have orbits typical of asteroids , and collide with the earth from typical neo orbits .",
    "based on the estimated collision probability @xmath160 we find that 1-km former tnos now collide with the earth once in 0.75 myr .",
    "this value of @xmath6 is smaller than that for our @xmath53 runs , and is only 1/20 of that for our 7852 jcos . assuming the total mass of planetesimals that ever crossed jupiter s orbit is @xmath3@xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the mass of the earth ( ipatov , 1993 , 2000 )",
    ", we conclude that the total mass of bodies that impacted the earth is @xmath163 .",
    "if ices comprised only half of this mass , then the total mass of ices @xmath164 that were delivered to the earth from the feeding zone of the giant planets is about the mass of the terrestrial oceans ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "the calculated probabilities of collisions of objects with planets show that the fraction of the mass of the planet delivered by short - period comets can be greater for mars and venus than for the earth ( compare the values of @xmath6@xmath166@xmath167 using @xmath6 from tables 2 and 5 ) .",
    "this larger mass fraction would result in relatively large ancient oceans on mars and venus . on the other hand , there is the deuterium / hydrogen paradox of earth s oceans , as the d / h ratio is different for oceans and comets .",
    "pavlov et al . ( 1999 ) suggested that solar wind - implanted hydrogen on interplanetary dust particles could provide the necessary low - d / h component of earth s water inventory .",
    "our estimate of the migration of water to the early earth is in accordance with chyba ( 1989 ) , but is greater than those of morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and levison et al .",
    "the latter obtained smaller values of @xmath164 , and we suspect that this is because they did not take into account the migration of bodies into orbits with @xmath74@xmath54.5 au .",
    "perhaps this was because they modeled a relatively small number of objects , and levison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) did not take into account the influence of the terrestrial planets . in",
    "our runs the probability of a collision of a single object with a terrestrial planet could be much greater than the total probability of thousands of other objects , so the statistics are dominated by rare occurrences that might not appear in smaller simulations .",
    "the mean probabilities of collisions can differ by orders of magnitude for different jcos .",
    "other scientists considered other initial objects and smaller numbers of jupiter - crossing objects , and did not find decoupling from jupiter , which is a rare event .",
    "we believe there is no contradiction between our present results and the smaller migration of former jcos to the near - earth space that was obtained in earlier work , including our own papers ( e.g. ipatov and hahn , 1999 ) , where we used the same integration package .    there is additional evidence from the classification of objects based on their albedos . from measured albedos , fernandez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that the fraction of extinct comets among neos and unusual asteroids is significant ( at least 9% are candidates ) .",
    "the idea that there may be many extinct comets among neos was considered by several scientists .",
    "rickman et al . ( 2001 ) believed that comets played an important and perhaps even dominant role among all km - size earth impactors . in their opinion , dark spectral classes that might include the ex - comets are severely underrepresented",
    "( see also jewitt and fernandez , 2001 ) .",
    "our runs showed that if one observes former comets in neo orbits , then it is probable that they have already moved in such orbits for millions ( or at least hundreds of thousands ) years , and only a few of them have been in such orbits for short times ( a few thousand years ) .",
    "some former comets that have moved in typical neo orbits for millions or even hundreds of millions of years , and might have had multiple close encounters with the sun ( some of these encounters can be very close to the sun , e.g. in the case of comet 2p at @xmath91@xmath10.05 myr ) , could have lost their mantles , which causes their low albedo , and so change their albedo and would look like typical asteroids .",
    "typical comets have larger rotation periods than typical neos ( binzel et al . , 1992 , lupishko and lupishko , 2001 ) , but ,",
    "while losing considerable portions of their masses , extinct comets can decrease these periods . in future",
    "we plan to consider a larger initial number of objects initially located beyond jupiter in order to better estimate their probabilities of migration to a near - earth space .",
    "collision statistics for the terrestrial planets are dominated by very small numbers of bodies that reach orbits with high collision probabilities , so it is essential to consider very large numbers of particles .",
    "the initial conditions for the orbit integrations appear to matter more than the choice of orbit integrator .",
    "some jupiter - family comets can reach typical neo orbits and remain there for millions of years . while the probability of such events is small ( about 0.1% in our runs and perhaps smaller for other initial data ) , nevertheless the majority of collisions of former jcos with the terrestrial planets are due to such objects .",
    "the amount of water delivered to the earth during planet formation could be about the mass of the earth oceans . from the dynamical point of view",
    "there could be ( not  must be  ) many extinct comets among the neos .",
    "for better estimates of the portion of extinct comets among neos we will need orbit integrations for many more tnos and jcos , and wider analysis of observations and craters .",

    "<S> a small fraction of former jcos reached orbits with aphelia inside jupiter s orbit , and some reached apollo orbits with semi - major axes less than 2 au , aten orbits , and inner - earth orbits ( with aphelia less than 0.983 au ) and remained there for millions of years . though less than 0.1% of the total , these objects were responsible for most of the collision probability of former jcos with earth and venus . </S>",
    "<S> some jupiter - family comets can reach inclinations @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a significant fraction of near - earth objects could be extinct comets that came from the trans - neptunian region . </S>"
