    "the notion that binary stellar systems ( e.g , @xcite ) or planetary systems ( e.g , @xcite ) shape planetary nebulae ( pne ) has gained a huge support over the years , both from theoretical considerations that point to the difficulties of models based on single asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stellar progenitors to shape pne ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and from a large number of observations and their analysis ( e.g. , from 2015 on , @xcite ) . in most cases of shaping by binary interaction ,",
    "jets are involved ( e.g. , @xcite , to list a small number out of hundreds of papers ) .",
    "a relatively small number of papers raise the possibility that triple stellar systems are behind the morphologies of some pne ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a claim for a triple stellar system in the pn suwt",
    "2 @xcite was rejected recently by @xcite .",
    "in general there are two orbital planes .",
    "one is that of the more tight binary system , and the second one is that of the triple stellar system , i.e. , of the tight binary system motion around the center of mass with the third star .",
    "if the two orbital planes coincides , the interaction leads to a mass loss geometry that has a plane of symmetry , even if the mass loss geometry departs from axi - symmetry .",
    "binary systems , e.g. , if the interaction time scale is shorter than the orbital period or if the orbit is eccentric , can also cause departure from axisymmetry ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the two orbital planes of the triple system are inclined to each other , the morphology of the descendant pn is likely to possess no symmetry plane .",
    "the descendant pn is actually likely to lack any symmetry ; nor point - symmetry , nor axial - symmetry , and nor mirror symmetry .",
    "we term this a ` messy pn ' .    as part of the increasing interest in mass transfer in evolving triple stellar systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "we extend our study of the shaping of pne by jets , now with properties as expected in some triple stellar systems . specifically , we consider the flow structure described by @xcite , where a tight binary system orbits an agb star and accretes mass from the agb wind . because the orbital plane of the tight binary system is not parallel to the orbital plane around the agb star ,",
    "the jets axis is not perpendicular to the orbital plane of the triple system .",
    "we describe the initial setting and the numerical code in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "we then describe the numerical results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "@xcite studied triple stellar systems where a tight binary system orbits an agb star that blows a dense wind .",
    "the two orbital planes , that of the tight binary system and that of the triple stellar system are inclined to each other .",
    "the tight binary system accretes mass from the wind .",
    "due to the orbital motion of the two stars of the tight binary system around their mutual center of mass , the accreted mass possess specific angular momentum that leads to the formation of an accretion disk around one ( or two ) of the stars .",
    "the plane of the accretion disk is close to being parallel to the orbital plane of the tight binary system .",
    "the accretion disk launches two opposite jets that are almost perpendicular to the orbital plane of the tight binary system .",
    "we do not study the mass accretion process , but assume that two opposite jets are launched from an origin that orbits the agb star . in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] we present a schematic drawing of the wind blown by the agb star and the jets launched by the tight binary system , and the orbit of the jets origin around the agb star .    .",
    "the tight binary system accretes mass from the agb wind and launches jets as indicated.,width=453 ]    we simulate two cases differ in the inclination angle @xmath0 of the jets axis to the line perpendicular to the orbital plane of the triple system . in the first case @xmath1 and in the second case @xmath2 .",
    "the other parameters are identical for the two runs and are as follows .",
    "the orbital separation of the jets origin ( the location of the tight binary system ) to the center of the agb star is @xmath3 .",
    "the orbital period is @xmath4yrs , corresponding to a total mass of the triple stellar system of @xmath5 .    at the beginning of each simulation",
    "the slow agb winds fills the grid .",
    "the mass loss rate and velocity into the slow agb wind are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .    at @xmath8",
    "we start to launch two jets , along the @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions .",
    "the jets are conical , with a half opening angle of @xmath11 .",
    "the jets opening angle influences the morphology of the nebula . however , we have limited numerical resources and can not study more cases at this time",
    ". the initial velocity of the jets is @xmath12 , that is about equal to the escape speed from a main sequence star .",
    "the mass loss rate into the two jets together is @xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath14 of the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion rate from the wind .",
    "our simulations are performed by using version 4.0-beta of the flash code @xcite .",
    "the flash code is an adaptive - mesh refinement ( amr ) modular code used for solving hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics problems .",
    "here we use the unsplit ppm ( piecewise - parabolic method ) solver of flash .",
    "we neither include gravity , as velocities are much above the escape speed in the region we simulate , nor radiative cooling .",
    "radiative cooling is important . at this first study",
    "we did not include radiation from the mass - accreting star(s ) as well .",
    "as we will see below , the gas does suffer a substantial adiabatic cooling .",
    "radiative cooling will further reduce the gas temperature , while radiation from the stars can heat it . as we did not include radiative cooling and radiation",
    ", our results can not reproduce exact details of observed pne , but non the less give the overall morphological characteristics of ` messy nebulae ' .",
    "we employ a full 3d amr ( 8 levels ; @xmath15 cells in each direction , or 10 levels ; @xmath16 ) using a cartesian grid @xmath17 with outflow boundary conditions at all boundary surfaces .",
    "the center of the grid is at ( 0,0,0 ) .",
    "the agb star is placed at ( 0,0,@xmath18 ) .",
    "the tight binary system orbits the agb star along a circle as shown in [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "we simulate the whole space with no symmetry assumptions .",
    "the jets are continuously launched during the entire simulated time .",
    "the slow wind and the jets start with a temperature of @xmath19 .",
    "the initial jets temperature has no influence on the results ( as long as it is highly supersonic ) because the jets rapidly cool due to adiabatic expansion . for numerical reasons",
    "a weak slow wind is injected from the jets origin in the sector @xmath20 .",
    "this wind has a small effect on the outcome , as it contains very little energy . without this wind numerical instabilities",
    "might develop on the boundary between the ambient gas and the sphere from where the jets are launched ( more numerical details are in @xcite ) .",
    "in fig . [ fig : rho20degree ] we present density maps in the @xmath21 plane for the @xmath1 case ( see fig . [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) , at four times . in all panels",
    "the agb star is located just below the center of the grid at @xmath22 .",
    "the source of the jets orbits the agb star , and its location is @xmath23 at @xmath24 , @xmath25 at @xmath26 , @xmath27 at @xmath28 , and @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "the main outcome of the simulation is a nebula that lacks any symmetry .",
    "we simulate only the early interaction time , and can not deduce the exact final nebular shape that is observed at later time .",
    "nonetheless , our results clearly demonstrates the early formation of a ` messy pn ' .",
    "the arrows depict the flow direction at each point , but not its value .",
    "we can notice a complicated flow structure in the low density regions that are enclosed by the dense shell .",
    "these low density regions are filled with the shocked jets material .",
    "these regions contain little mass , and will not be observed in the visible when the object turns into a pn . the complicated flow structure in these regions , including many vortexes , forms many filaments in the dense gas ; these will be observed in the pn phase .",
    "we will now turn to describe only the @xmath2 case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho30degree ] we present the density maps for the @xmath2 simulation . now",
    "the agb star is located below the center of the grid at @xmath31 , and the source of the jets that orbits the agb star is located at @xmath32 at @xmath24 , @xmath33 at @xmath26 , @xmath34 at @xmath28 , and @xmath35 at @xmath30",
    ". the results are not much different from those for the @xmath1 case presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho20degree ] .",
    "the two main morphological features are a messy shape and the formation of a filamentary structure .",
    "we present the temperature maps ( in kelvin ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp30degree ] , corresponding to the same planes and times as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho30degree ] .",
    "the jets are shocked to temperatures of few millions degrees kelvin .",
    "the post - shock gas suffers a substantial adiabatic cooling .",
    "nonetheless , the high temperatures regions in the maps correspond to post - shock jets material .",
    "these are regions of low density , that when surrounded by dense agb gas are termed bubbles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutsxz ] we present the density maps ( again , for the @xmath2 case ) at @xmath36 and in four different planes perpendicular to the @xmath37 plane .",
    "the angle @xmath38 is the angle between the plane and the @xmath39 plane shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho30degree ] . in these panels",
    "the horizontal axis is not the @xmath40 axis of the grid that is used in the previous figures , but it is actually @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts_vel ] we plot the velocity magnitude , @xmath42 , given in units of @xmath43 by the color bar , and show the velocity direction with arrows , in the same four planes .",
    "the four panels in these two figures emphasize the lack of any symmetry in the outflow , i.e. , a ` messy nebula ' , as each panel presents a different density structure . the panels show also the presence of many dense filaments in the nebula .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : cutsxya ] and [ fig : cutsxyb ] we present the density structure and temperature maps with velocity direction , respectively , in six planes parallel to the @xmath44 plane , characterized by their distance from the @xmath44 plane .",
    "as before , these panels emphasize the messy nebula and the presence of filaments .",
    "cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] , we present the three - dimensional density structure of the gas at @xmath30 .",
    "each panel emphasizes surfaces with different densities as indicated .",
    "these panels fully reveal the messy nature of the nebula and the filaments in the outflow .",
    "we conducted 3d hydrodynamical simulations of fast jets interacting with a slow wind from an agb star .",
    "the source of the jets orbits the agb star with an orbital period of @xmath4yrs .",
    "the significant new ingredient in the simulations was that the symmetry axis of the jets is inclined to the angular momentum axis of the triple - stellar system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "such a flow might result if the jets are launched by a star that is a member of tight binary system that orbits the agb star , accretes mass from its wind , and the orbital plane of the tight binary system is inclined to the orbital plane of the triple system .",
    "the evolution of the density structure in one plane is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : rho20degree ] and [ fig : rho30degree ] for two different cases simulated .",
    "the density structures in different planes at the end of the simulation for the @xmath45 case are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : cutsxz ] and [ fig : cutsxya ] .",
    "these figures clearly show that the nebula lacks any symmetry , and has many filaments .",
    "this is termed a ` messy nebula ' .",
    "the high temperature regions that are seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : temp30degree ] and [ fig : cutsxyb ] are regions of post - shock jets material .",
    "they have low density , and are termed bubbles .",
    "the complicated flow structures of the post - shock jets material , including vortexes , seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : rho20degree ] , [ fig : cuts_vel ] , and [ fig : cutsxyb ] , account in part for the filamentary structure of the dense gas .",
    "the full glory of the messy nebula is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d ] .",
    "one outcome of the motion of the jets in an inclined orbit is that each jet encounters a denser agb wind than the other jet during half of the orbital period . over all",
    ", the jets do not penetrate in our simulations to large distances , and the bubbles that are formed are small .",
    "for example , an ` hourglass ' nebula is not formed in our simulations .",
    "one possible example @xcite might be the pn ngc  6210 ( images by @xcite ) , that might as well ended in a merger @xcite .",
    "our results strengthen the call @xcite for the search of a triple stellar systems at the center of some messy pne .",
