    "the issue of polydispersity is crucial to understand phase behaviour in experiments on colloidal suspensions of spherical and anisometric particles .",
    "the latter , of either rod- or plate - like shape , are known to form liquid - crystalline phases @xcite and their phase equilibria is largely affected by size dispersity @xcite .",
    "colloidal particles can never be made truly identical , and even a small amount of polydispersity is unavoidable in real samples .",
    "platelets with varying degrees of polydispersity , in particular , are being extensively studied in recent years . in this material ,",
    "polydispersity greatly facilitates gelation , and in fact the nematic phase is difficult to reach in suspensions of charge - stabilised platelike particles ( the most common plate - like particles ) at particle concentrations below that at which a glassy state is formed @xcite .",
    "however , it was possible to obtain a nematic phase in hard - like platelets , e.g. gibbsite particles with steric stabilisers @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the observation of equilibrium nematic phases in suspensions of charged colloidal platelets requires fine - tuning of the ionic strength of the solvent @xcite .",
    "therefore , the concomitant effects of polydispersity and soft interactions seem to be an important issue as regards the stabilisation of the nematic phase .    besides the nematic phase",
    ", liquid - crystalline phases with partial spatial order in colloidal suspensions of platelets are now being investigated @xcite .",
    "the most common phase is the columnar phase , which admits a surprisingly large ( up to 25% ) degree of polydispersity in diameter .",
    "suspensions of sterically - stabilised gibbsite platelets with added non - absorbing polymer exhibit a rich phase diagram , with gravity - induced three - phase coexistence regions involving isotropic , nematic and columnar phases , and enhanced fractionation effects @xcite . by contrast , observations of the layered smectic phase are very rare in these systems @xcite , since the columnar phase is very stable at high particle concentrations .    in a recent paper @xcite , smectic ordering was observed in colloidal suspensions of equally - thick charged platelets with high polydispersity in diameter and in a solvent with low ionic strength .",
    "it is though that the extreme diameter polydispersity ( @xmath0 ) , possibly combined with the monodispersity in thickness , is responsible for the instability of the columnar phase in favour of the smectic phase",
    ". it would be interesting to theoretically analyse the effect of polydispersity on the formation of the spatially - ordered smectic phase in systems where the columnar phase is suppressed .    on the other hand , additional soft interactions are known to affect the phase diagram .",
    "these interactions can be screened coulomb particle interactions due to the addition of salt to an aqueous solution of charged particles , or attractive depletion forces @xcite between the colloidal particles arising from addition of non - absorbing polymer to a suspension of effectively hard platelets @xcite .",
    "the possibility of theoretically predicting how both factors ( polydipersity and soft interactions ) influence the formation of phases with partial spatial order ( smectic and columnar phases ) would be highly desirable .    in the present paper",
    "we study the effects of polydispersity and soft interactions on the nematic vs. smectic phase equilibrium .",
    "the work was inspired by the paper by sun and coworkers @xcite , who synthesised novel platelet particles from @xmath1-zrp minerals by a special exfoliation procedure , which creates a perfectly monodisperse thickness distribution @xcite with high polydispersity in diameter .",
    "low ionic - strength aqueous solutions of these charged particles form equilibrium nematic phases , followed by an incipient smectic ordering which equilibrates very slowly ; no hint of columnar ordering was found @xcite .    in the experiments by sun et al .",
    "@xcite the ionic strength of the solution was not controlled .",
    "however , addition of salt to the suspension will modify the long - ranged repulsive interactions between platelets .",
    "our second aim is to predict how the nematic vs. smectic phase equilibrium of the suspension will be modified when the range of interactions is changed .",
    "these results could also apply to suspensions of colloidal platelets with non - absorbing polymer , where effectively attractive depletion force between platelets usually result in demixing between phases with different concentrations of colloids and polymers @xcite ; therefore , we also consider attractive soft interactions of varying range . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , addition of non - absorbing polymer to a one - component fluid of hard rods may give rise to isotropic liquid - liquid phase separation ending in a critical point ( for large polymer coils ) , and to the presence of a broad coexistence region of isotropic - nematic , isotropic - smectic and isotropic - crystal phases .",
    "binary mixtures of colloidal disks and polymers exhibit not only isotropic - isotropic demixing , but also nematic - nematic demixing @xcite .",
    "however nonuniform phases were not taken into account in the latter study .",
    "as will be shown below , soft interactions between highly oriented platelets can induce nematic - nematic demixing and a dramatic broadening of the nematic - smectic transition region for sufficiently long - ranged interactions .",
    "the effect of polydispersity on the phase behavior of hard rods has been theoretically studied at the level of density functional theory ( using the onsager second virial theory ) mainly for uniform liquid crystal phases ( isotropic or nematic ) @xcite .",
    "also , a bimodal polydisperse distribution function in aspect ratio for hard board - like particles was used to study the effect of polydispersity on the phase stability of biaxial nematic vs. nematic - nematic demixing @xcite .",
    "the limit of zero polydispersity gives rise to a perfect binary ( bidisperse ) mixture , a case studied by varga and coworkers @xcite using onsager theory .",
    "harnau et al .",
    "@xcite and bier et al .",
    "@xcite have also studied perfect binary mixtures of platelets using density - functional theory @xcite in the restricted - orientation approximation .",
    "finally , a simulation study was done by bates and frenkel on the influence of polydispersity on nonuniform phases of rod - like particles : it was shown @xcite that the smectic phase of hard colloidal rods can be destabilized with respect to the columnar phase for high enough length polydispersity .",
    "density - functional studies of the relative stability of nonuniform ( smectic , columnar and crystal ) phases in polydisperse fluids made of anisotropic particles constitute a great challenge .",
    "the main difficulty is related to the numerical minimization of the functional as the density profile is a function of the spatial , angular and polydisperse variables .",
    "the present work is a first attempt to tackle the study of smectic phases in diameter - polydisperse platelets using density - functional tools and , in particular , fundamental - measure theory ( fmt ) of parallel hard cylinders @xcite .",

    "a typical feature of polydisperse systems is that the composition of the two coexisting phases varies as the phase transition takes place . in our case",

    "in this work we have discussed the phase behaviour of suspensions made of platelets .",
    "we were motivated by the recent finding of smectic ordering in an aqueous suspension of @xmath161zrp - based platelets of the same thickness but very polydisperse in diameter .",
    "the work has focused on the layered arrangement ( smectic phase ) of platelets arising from a suspension of positionally disordered , but perfectly orientationally ordered , particles ( nematic phase ) .",
    "the high polydispersity in diameter prevents the formation of the columnar phase , which has not been considered in the present work .",
    "the assumption of parallel , perfectly oriented platelets should be valid when the aspect ( diameter - to - thickness ) ratio is very high , which is the case in the @xmath161zrp samples and in many other discotic systems made from mineral materials .",
    "this assumption allows to use the powerful fundamental - measure density - functional theory for hard platelets , which is expected to accurately describe ordered arrangement of platelets , due to the emphasis of the theory on spatial correlations .",
    "our first aim was to obtain a picture of how the degree of diameter polydispersity affects the nematic - smectic phase transition .",
    "polydispersity tends to stabilise the smectic phase , due to a microsegregation effect which allows larger and similar particles to populate the layers and pack more efficiently .",
    "the platelet volume fraction of the sample at the nematic - smectic transition can be reduced by 5% for a degree of diameter polydispersity of 30% , quite typical of the experimental system .",
    "the transition is found to be always continuous , regardless of the degree of polydispersity .",
    "our second aim was to explore the consequences of soft interactions on the nematic - smectic transition .",
    "suspensions of platelets can be obtained using different techniques , and both attractive and repulsive particles can be designed .",
    "we have contemplated both cases using a simple monotonic yukawa - like interaction potential function which can be positive or negative .",
    "the sign of the soft interactions profoundly affects the phase behaviour .",
    "for example , when platelets are identical ( zero polydispersity ) , soft repulsive forces always induce a continuous nematic - smectic transition , with the smectic phase stabilising with respect to the nematic for a decreasing range of the force . by contrast , when the interactions are attractive , the transition becomes of the first order for temperatures below a tricritical temperature .",
    "in addition , when the interaction range is sufficiently long , there appears a nematic demixing phenomenon , whereby two nematic phases of different platelet concentration appear in the suspension .",
    "both nematic phases may coexist with a smectic phase at a triple - point temperature . in this case",
    "the smectic phase is slightly destabilised as the range of the force is decreased .",
    "polydispersity changes this scenario to some extent . while nematic demixing is not much affected ( at least for polydispersities @xmath162 ) , the tricritical temperature moves to very high values , and the nematic - smectic transition becomes of first order even for a small degree of polydispersity .",
    "the application of the present results to real experimental samples may be done after cautiously considering the type of interactions present in the platelets .",
    "surface charges , counterions , hydration effects , etc . may play a role in the total balance between attractive and repulsive forces .",
    "also , the interactions may have different sign with respect to distance .",
    "another aspect , not contemplated in the present work , is the role of the isotropic phase , which is stable at lower packing fractions .",
    "the analysis of the isotropic phase requires a different theoretical framework in order to account for orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the fundamental - measure density functional for freely - rotating hard platelets with vanishing thickness @xcite ( adequately extended to the polydisperse case ) could be a good candidate for a reference system in perturbation theories for soft platelets .",
    "a complete picture would be obtained by incorporating the columnar phase , which could in principle be done within the present theory , but at a higher computational cost .",
    "the computation of the full phase diagram , and the study of how polydispersity in diameter and/or thickness , soft direct and solvent - induced interactions , etc .",
    ", change the phase behaviour of platelet suspensions , is a big challenge from a theoretical point of view .",
    "this work represents a step toward that goal .",
