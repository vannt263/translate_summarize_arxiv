    "scintillometers detect fluctuations in the intensity of a beam of light that passes through a path length of 50 m to 5000 m of near - ground turbulence in the surface layer @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are related to the structure function of the index of refraction @xmath1 , and the turbulence inner - scale length @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the index of refraction is a function of temperature and humidity ; thus @xmath1 can be decomposed into structure functions of temperature @xmath2 and humidity @xmath3 as @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "scintillometer wavelengths are selected that are each more sensitive to fluctuations in one variable ( such as temperature ) than others ( such as humidity ) , so that @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be resolved .",
    "for example , intensity fluctuations of visible and near - infrared beams are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations than humidity fluctuations , while microwave beams are more sensitive to humidity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "structure functions such as @xmath1 are described in , and represent the strength and spacial frequency of perturbations in variables ; thus @xmath1 is a measure of turbulence intensity weighted by the susceptibility of the index of refraction of the medium to changes in variables such as temperature and humidity .",
    "the goal of this study is to solve for the sensible heat flux @xmath7 and the momentum flux @xmath8 as functions of source measurements such as @xmath1 and @xmath0 , as well as to quantify the propagation of uncertainty from source measurements to the calculated values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "another type of turbulent flux is the latent heat flux @xmath9 .",
    "the turbulent fluxes are given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the temperature and humidity scales , @xmath13 is the friction velocity , @xmath14 is the density of the air , @xmath15 is the specific heat at constant pressure , and @xmath16 is the latent heat of vaporization .",
    "determining area - averaged turbulent fluxes involves solving for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are related to the path - length scale structure - function measurements through the non - linearly coupled monin - obukhov similarity equations @xcite .",
    "this procedure also involves solving for @xmath13 in eqs .",

    "we consider here a displaced - beam scintillometer strategy in which path - averaged measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are obtained .",
    "other required measurements include temporally - averaged pressure @xmath17 , temperature @xmath2 , humidity @xmath3 , as well as the height of the beam above the underlying terrain @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath17 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath18 are referred to as the source measurements .",

    "uncertainty propagates from the source measurements to the derived variables via the set of equations being considered .",

    "we explore the use of scintillometers over flat and homogeneous terrain , thus the height of the beam @xmath18 is considered to be a single value with its associated uncertainty . while @xmath1 and @xmath0 are representative of turbulent fluctuations along the whole beam , @xmath17 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are typically point measurements representative of localized areas near their respective instruments .",
    "applications for scintillometers include agricultural scientific studies such as and , and aggregation of surface measurements to satellite - retrieval scales for weather prediction and climate monitoring as in and in",
    ". the unique spacial scale of scintillometer measurements gives them the potential for a key role in bridging the gap between ground - based instruments with footprints on the order of @xmath19 @xmath20 and model and satellite - retrieval scales on the order of @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the scale of scintillometer measurements introduces an additional complexity in the retrieval of the turbulent fluxes .",
    "this retrieval combines the large - scale scintillometer measured variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 with source measurements that are not necessarily representative of the same scale .",
    "the only exception to be considered is the atmospheric pressure @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be representative of smaller footprints around their respective instruments . specifically , assuming that variables such as average temperature t represent the entire beam path introduces a form of uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty is somewhat similar to a systematic error , although it may be difficult to quantify because of its temporal variability .    of previous scintillometer sensitivity studies ,",
    "some stand out as possibly contradicting each other .",
    "for instance , the conclusion of the error analysis in for a @xmath0 and @xmath1 strategy was that _",
    "`` the monte carlo analysis of the propagation of the statistical errors shows that there is only moderate sensitivity of the flux calculations to the initial errors in the measured quantities . ''",
