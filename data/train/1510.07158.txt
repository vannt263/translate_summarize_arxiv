    "network characteristics such as loss rate , delay , available bandwidth , and their distributions are critical to various network operations and important for understanding network behaviors . although considerable attention has been given to network measurements , due to various reasons ( e.g. , security , commercial interest and administrative boundary ) some characteristics of the network can not be obtained directly from a large network . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "network tomography was proposed in @xcite , suggesting the use of end - to - end measurement and statistical inference to estimate characteristics of a large network . in an end - to - end measurement , a number of sources are attached to the network of interest to send probes to receivers attached to the other side of the network , and paths from sources to receivers cover links of interest .",
    "arrival orders and arrival times of the probes carry the information of the network , from which many network characteristics can be inferred statistically .",
    "characteristics that have been estimated in this manner include link - level loss rates @xcite , delay distributions @xcite , origin - destination traffic @xcite , loss patterns @xcite , and the network topology @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the problem of estimating loss rates .    network topologies connecting sources to receivers can be divided into two classes : tree and general .",
    "a tree topology , as named , has a single source attached to the root of a multicast tree to send probes to receivers attached to the leaf nodes of the tree . a network with a general topology , however , requires a number of trees to cover all links of the network .",
    "each tree has one source sending probes to receivers in it . because of the use of multiple sources to send probes in a network with general topology , those nodes and receivers located at intersections of multiple trees can receive probes from multiple sources . in this case",
    ", we must consider impacts of probes sent by all sources simultaneously in order to get a good estimate .",
    "this task is much more challenging than the tree topology case .",
    "numerous methods have been proposed for loss tomography in a tree topology .",
    "c@xmath0ceres _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a bernoulli model to describe the loss behavior of a link , and derived the mle for the pass rate of a path connecting the source to a node , which was expressed as the solution of a polynomial equation @xcite . to ease the concern of using numerical methods to solve a high degree polynomial ,",
    "several papers have been published to accelerate the calculation at the price of a little accuracy loss : zhu and geng proposed a recursively defined estimator based on a bottom - up strategy in @xcite ; duffield _ et al . _",
    "proposed a closed - form estimator in @xcite , which has the same asymptotic variance as the mle to the first order .",
    "considering the unavailability of multicast in some networks , harfoush _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and coates _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite independently proposed the use of the unicast - based multicast to send probes to receivers , where coates _ et al .",
    "_ also suggested the use of the em algorithm @xcite to estimate link - level loss rates .    for networks beyond a tree , however , little research has been done , although a majority of networks in practice fall into this category .",
    "conceptually , the topology of a general network can be arbitrarily complicated .",
    "however , no matter how complicated a general topology is , it can always be covered by a group of carefully selected trees , in each of which an end - to - end experiment can be carried out independently to study the properties of the subnetwork covered by the tree .",
    "if these trees do not overlap with each other , the problem of studying the whole general network can be decomposed into a group of smaller subproblems , each for one tree .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the network topology and practical constraints , it is more than often that the selected trees overlaps significantly , i.e. , some links are shared by two or more trees ( see figure [ l5net ] for example ) .",
    "the shared links of two selected trees induce dependence between the two trees . simply ignoring the dependence leads to a loss of information .",
    "how to effectively integrate the information from multiple trees to achieve a joint analysis is a major challenge in network tomography of general topology .",
    "the first effort on network tomography of general topology is due to bu _",
    "@xcite , who attempted to extend the method in @xcite to networks with general topology .",
    "unfortunately , the authors failed to derive an explicit expression for the mle like the one presented in @xcite for this more general case .",
    "they then resorted to an iterative procedure ( i.e. , the em algorithm ) to search for the mle .",
    "in addition , a heuristic method , called _ minimum variance weighted average _ ( mvwa ) algorithm , was also proposed in @xcite , which deals with each tree in a general topology separately and averages the results .",
    "the mvwa algorithm is less efficient than the em algorithm , especially when the sample size is small .",
    "_ in @xcite considered the tomography problem for networks with an unknown but general topology , mainly focusing on network topology identification , which is beyond the scope of our current paper .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a new perspective for the study of loss tomography , which is applicable to both tree and general topologies .",
    "our theoretical contributions are : 1 ) introducing a set of novel statistics , which are complete and minimal sufficient ; 2 ) deriving two alternative parameter systems and the corresponding re - parameterized likelihood functions , which benefit us both theoretically and computationally ; 3 ) discovering that the loss tomography for a general topology shares the same mathematical formulation as that of a tree topology ; and , 4 ) showing that the likelihood function belongs to the exponential family and has a unique mode ( which is the mle ) under regularity conditions .",
    "based on these theoretical results , we propose two new algorithms ( a likelihood - equation - based algorithm called le-@xmath1 and an em - based algorithm called pcem ) to find mle . compared to existing methods in the literature , the proposed methods are computationally much more efficient .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces notations for tree topologies and the stochastic model for loss rate inference .",
    "section 3 describes a set of novel statistics and two alternative parameter systems for loss rate analysis in tree topologies .",
    "new forms of the likelihood function are established based on the novel statistics and re - parametrization .",
    "section 4 extends the above results to general topologies .",
    "section 5 and 6 propose two new algorithms for finding mle of @xmath2 , which enjoy great computational advantages over existing methods .",
    "section 7 evaluates performances of the proposed methods by simulations .",
    "we conclude the article in section 8 .",
    "we use @xmath3 to denote the multicast tree of interest , where @xmath4 is a set of nodes representing the routers and switches in the network , and @xmath5 is a set of directed links connecting the nodes . two nodes connected by a directed link",
    "are called the _ parent node _ and the _ child node _ , respectively , and the direction of the arrow indicates that the parent forwards received probes to the child .",
    "figure [ struct ] shows a typical multicast tree .",
    "note that the root node of a multicast tree has only one child , which is slightly different from an ordinary tree , and each non - root node has exactly one parent .",
    "( 4,3.5 ) ( 0.3,-0.2 )    each link is assigned a unique i d number ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , based on which each node obtains its unique i d number ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath7 correspondingly so that link @xmath9 connects node @xmath9 with its parent node .",
    "number @xmath8 is reserved for the source node .",
    "in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , whose methods are node - centric , our methods here focus on links instead . for a network with tree topology ,",
    "the two reference systems are equivalent as there exists an one - to - one mapping between nodes and links : every node in the network ( except for the source ) has a unique parent link .",
    "for a network with general topology , however , the link - centric system is more convenient , as a node in the network may have multiple parent links .",
    "we let @xmath10 denote the unique parent link , @xmath11 the brother links , and @xmath12 the child links , respectively , of link @xmath9 .",
    "to be precise , @xmath11 contains all links that share the same parent node with link @xmath9 , including link @xmath9 itself .",
    "a subtree @xmath13 is defined as the subnetwork composed of link @xmath9 and all its descendant links .",
    "we let @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the set of receivers ( i.e. , leaf nodes ) in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "sometimes , we also use @xmath14 or @xmath15 to denote the leaf links of @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the concrete meaning of @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be determined based on the context .",
    "taking the multicast tree displayed in figure [ struct ] as an example , we have @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "for the subtree @xmath21 , however , we have @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for link 2 ,",
    "its parent link is @xmath25 , its brother links are @xmath26 , and its child links are @xmath27 .      in a multicast experiment ,",
    "@xmath28 probe packages are sent from the root node @xmath8 to all the receivers .",
    "let @xmath29 if the @xmath30-th probe package reached node @xmath9 , and @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "the status of probes at receivers @xmath31 can be directly observed from the multicast experiment ; but , the status of probes at internal links can not be directly observed . in the following , we use",
    "@xmath32 , where @xmath33 , to denote the data collected in a multicast experiment in tree @xmath16 .    in this paper",
    ", we model the loss behavior of links by the bernoulli distribution and assume the _ spatial - temporal independence _ and _ temporal homogeneity _ for the network , i.e. the event @xmath34 are independent across @xmath9 and @xmath30 , and @xmath35 we call @xmath36 the _ link - level loss rates _ , and the goal of loss tomography is to estimate @xmath2 from @xmath37 .      in principle , @xmath38 can be any value in @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "thus , the natural parameter space of @xmath2 is @xmath40^m$ ] , an @xmath7-dimensional closed unit cube . in this paper , however , we assume that @xmath41 for every @xmath42 , and thus constrain the parameter space to @xmath43 , to simplify the problem . if @xmath44 for some @xmath42 , then the subtree @xmath17 is actually disconnected from the other part of the network , since no probes can go through link @xmath9 . in this case , the loss rate of other links in @xmath17 are not estimable due to the lack of information . on the other hand , if @xmath45 for some @xmath42 , the original network of interest degenerates to an equivalent network where node @xmath9 is removed and all its child nodes are connected directly to node @xmath9 s parent node . by constraining the parameter space of @xmath2 into @xmath46 , we exclude these degenerate cases from consideration .",
    "given the loss model for each link , we can write down the likelihood function and use the maximum likelihood principle to determine unknown parameters . that is , we aim to find the parameter value that maximizes the log - likelihood function : @xmath47 where @xmath48 stands for the observation at receivers ( i.e. , a realization of @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 is the space of all possible observations with @xmath51 denoting the size of set @xmath14 , @xmath52 is the number of occurrences of observation @xmath48 , and @xmath53 is the probability of observing @xmath48 given parameter value @xmath2 .",
    "however , the log - likelihood function ( [ obj ] ) is more symbolic than practical because of the following reasons : ( 1 ) evaluating the log - likelihood function ( [ obj ] ) is an expensive operation as it needs to scan through all possible @xmath54 ; and , ( 2 ) the likelihood equation derived from ( [ obj ] ) can not be solved analytically , and it is often computationally expensive to pursue a numerical solution .      instead of using the log - likelihood function ( [ obj ] ) directly , we consider to rewrite it in a different form . under the posited probabilistic model ,",
    "the overall likelihood @xmath55 is the product of the likelihood from each probe , i.e. , @xmath56 thus , an alternative form of the overall likelihood can be obtained by explicating the likelihood of each single probe and accumulating them .",
    "two concepts called _ internal state _ and _ internal view _ can be generated from this process .      for a link @xmath42 , given the observation of probe @xmath30 at @xmath15 and @xmath57 , we are able to partially confirm whether the probe passes link @xmath9 . formally , for observation @xmath58 , we define @xmath59 as the _ internal state _ of link @xmath9 for probe @xmath30 . if @xmath60 , probe @xmath30 reaches at least one receiver attached to @xmath17 , which implies that the probe passes link @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , by considering @xmath61 and @xmath62 simultaneously , we have three possible scenarios for each internal node @xmath9 :    * @xmath63 , i.e. , we observed that probe @xmath30 passed link @xmath9 ; or * @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. , we observed that probe @xmath30 reached node @xmath10 , but we did not know whether it reached node @xmath9 or not ; or * @xmath66 , i.e. , we did not know whether probe @xmath30 reached node @xmath10 or not at all ;    as @xmath67 and @xmath60 can never happen by definition of @xmath68 .",
    "the three scenarios have different impacts on the likelihood function .",
    "formally , define @xmath69 we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 represents the probability that a probe sending out from the root node of @xmath17 fails to reach any leaf node in @xmath17 .",
    "accumulating the internal states of each link in the experiment , we have @xmath72 which counts the number of probes whose pass through link @xmath9 can be confirmed from observations .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath73",
    ". moreover , define @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "we call the statistics @xmath76 the _ internal view _ of link @xmath9 . based on internal views ,",

    "we verify the following facts via simulations :    1 .",
    "pcem obtains exactly same results as the naive em for both tree topology and general topology , but is much faster ; 2 .",
    "le-@xmath1 obtains exactly same results as the em algorithm when regularity conditions ( [ regularitycondition ] ) and ( [ exception ] ) hold , but is much faster when the speedup from parallel computation is considered .",
    "we carried out simulations on a 5-layer network covered by two trees as showed in figure [ l5net ] .",
    "the network has 49 nodes labeled from node 0 to node 48 , and two sources node 0 and node 32 .",
    "we conduct two set of simulations .",
    "one is based on the ideal model , and the other is by using network simulator 2 ( ns-2 , @xcite ) .      in the first set of simulations ,",
    "the data is generated from the ideal model where each link has a pre - defined constant loss rate .    to test the performance of methods on different magnitude of loss rates , we draw the link - level loss rates from beta distributions with different parameters .",
    "the link - level loss rates @xmath227 are randomly sampled from @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 or @xmath231 .",
    "for example , the mean of @xmath231 is @xmath232 , so if we draw loss rates from @xmath231 , then on average we expect a @xmath233 link - level loss rate in the network . given the loss rate vector @xmath2 for each network , we generated @xmath234 independent datasets with sample sizes @xmath235 , @xmath234 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 , respectively .",
    "thus , a total of @xmath238 datasets were simulated .",
    "the sample size is evenly distributed into the two trees , e.g. , the source of each tree will send out @xmath234 probes when sample size @xmath239 .    to each of the 1600 simulated data sets , we applied nem ,",
    "pcem , le-@xmath1 and mvwa , respectively .",
    "the stopping rule of the em algorithms is @xmath240 , the initial values are @xmath241 for all @xmath242 .",
    "we implement mvwa algorithm by obtaining mle estimate in each tree with le-@xmath1 algorithm .",
    "table [ mse_l5 ] summarize the average running time and mses of these methods under different settings . from the tables",
    ", we can see that :    1 .",
    "the performances of all four methods in term of mse improve with the increase of sample size @xmath28 in both networks .",
    "2 .   nem and pcem",
    "always get exactly same results .",
    "the result from le-@xmath1 is slightly different from these of the em algorithms when sample size @xmath28 is as small as @xmath234 or @xmath236 due to the violation of the regularity conditions ( [ regularitycondition ] ) and ( [ exception ] ) . when @xmath243 , the results of le-@xmath1 and em algorithms become identical .",
    "4 .   le-@xmath1 , pcem and mvwa algorithm implemented with le-@xmath1 are dramatically faster than nem .",
    "for example , in simulation configuration with @xmath244 and sample size @xmath243 , the running time of nem is almost 2,000 times of le-@xmath1 and pcem .",
    "the mse of mvwa is always larger than the mse of the other three methods , which capture the mle .",
    "this is consistent with the result in @xcite .",
    "we also conduct the simulation study using ns-2 .",
    "we use the network topology shown in figure [ l5net ] , where the two sources located at node 0 and node 32 multicast probes to the attached receivers . besides the network traffic created by multicast probing",
    ", a number of tcp sources with various window sizes and a number of udp sources with different burst rates and periods are added at several nodes to produce cross - traffic .",
    "the tcp and udp cross - traffic takes about @xmath245 of the total network traffic .",
    "we generated @xmath234 independent datasets by running the ns-2 simulation for 1 , 2 , 5 or 10 simulation seconds .",
    "the longer experiments generate more multicast probes samples .",
    "we record all pass and loss events for each link during the simulation , and the actual loss rates are calculated and considered as the true loss rates for calculating mses .",
    "table [ mse_ns ] shows the average number of packets ( sample size ) , running time of methods and mses for different ns-2 simulation times .    in table",
    "[ mse_ns ] , we observe similar results as shown in table [ mse_l5 ] .",
    "the performances of all four methods in term of mse improve with the increase of sample size @xmath28 in both networks .",
    "the result from le-@xmath1 is slightly different from these of the em algorithms when sample size @xmath28 is as small .",
    "more importantly , le-@xmath1 and pcem are dramatically faster than nem .",
    "we proposed a set of sufficient statistics called _ internal view _ and two alternative parameter systems @xmath1 and @xmath100 for loss tomography .",
    "we found that the likelihood function keeps the exactly same formulation for both tree and general topologies under all three types of parametrization ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath100 ) , and we can switch among the three parameter systems freely without changing the result of parameter estimation .",
    "we also discovered that the parameterization of the likelihood function based on @xmath100 falls into the standard exponential family , which has a unique mode in parameter space @xmath246 under regularity conditions , and the parametrization based on @xmath1 leads to an efficient algorithm called le-@xmath1 to calculate the mle , which can be carried out in a parallel fashion .",
    "these results indicate that loss tomography for general topologies enjoys the same mathematical nature as that for tree topologies , and can be resolved effectively .",
    "the proposed statistics and alternative parameter systems also lead to a more efficient pattern - collapsed implementation of the em algorithm for finding mle , and a theoretical promise that the em algorithm converges to the mle with probability one when sample size is large enough .",
    "simulation studies confirmed our theoretical analysis as well as the superiority of the proposed methods over existing methods .",
