    "the velocity of each @xmath88 is extracted by measuring the position of the maximum of the packet at the most convenient time , i.e.  at that time where we can resolve @xmath88 and the spreading of one packet does not destroy the other packets .",

    "the velocity of the remaining wavepacket , @xmath78 ( diamonds ) , is more difficult to assess , since it overlaps at the beginning with other ones .",
    "nevertheless , its velocity closely follows the one of charge excitations .",
    "the wavepackets just described deliver a direct visualization of the excitations appearing in the bethe - ansatz solution , where only two different kinds of particles are involved : the @xmath31 and @xmath30 pseudoparticles with their associated bands .",

    "in fact , the velocities of @xmath77 and @xmath79 correspond to the group velocity at both pseudo - fermi momenta @xmath114 , indicating that these wavepackets correspond to low energy excitations .",
    "this explains the fact that @xmath92 is well described by ll theory in spite of the fermion being injected at high energy , and supports the assumption that the same applies to a left going wavepacket for spin ( see fig .",
    "[ ksquestion ] ) . furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the velocity of those fractions is independent of the momentum of the injected fermion , in agreement with the picture given by bethe - ansatz .",

    "we understand this as due to the fact that @xmath98 , by analogy to what we observe in the @xmath118 case . on the susy point",
    "this case is reached in the limit of vanishing density , where the system can be described by a fermi gas .",

    "their contribution to the spectral function is contained in the intensities of the spectrum , but no distinct feature allows to extract them from it .",

    "it is tempting to assign those excitations to states at a pseudo - fermi surface for charge excitations . for smaller values of @xmath124 than those in fig .",

    "however , no left propagating fraction of spin could be observed ( excepting the small depression due to finite - size effects ) .",
