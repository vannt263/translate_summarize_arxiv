    "on the 4th of july 2012 , the atlas and cms collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have discovered a higgs - like resonance about 125 gev@xcite . with current data , all properties of the discovered higgs boson",
    "turn out to be in rough agreement with expectations of the standard model ( sm)@xcite . due to the large experimental uncertainties , there remains a plenty of room for new physics in higgs sector@xcite . in order to ultimately establish its nature ,",
    "a precise measurement of the higgs couplings is essential and this task will be performed in the next phase of the lhc and future higgs factory .",
    "the yukawa couplings play an important role in probing the new physics since they are sensitive to new flavor dynamics . in view of the large mass ,",
    "the top quark owns the strongest yukawa coupling so that it is an appropriate probe for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism and new physics@xcite . as a direct probe of the top yukawa coupling , the production of a top pair associated with a higgs boson(@xmath2 production )",
    "is a golden channel and has received great attention by the experimenters@xcite and theorists@xcite .",
    "however , the information on the relative sign between the top yukawa coupling and higgs coupling to gauge bosons will still be lacking . in this respect",
    ", the production of a single top quark associated with a higgs boson ( @xmath3 production ) can bring a rather unique possibility@xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 production process can be divided into three different modes characterised by the virtuality of the @xmath5 boson@xcite : ( i ) @xmath0-channel , where the @xmath5 is spacelike ; ( ii ) @xmath6-channel , where the @xmath5 is timelike ; ( iii ) @xmath5-associated , where there is emission of a real @xmath5 boson . besides",
    ", the anomalous @xmath4 production process can be induced by the top - higgs flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) interactions@xcite .    the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht)@xcite was proposed as a possible solution to the hierarchy problem and so far remains a popular candidate of new physics .",
    "the lht model predicts new gauge bosons , scalars , mirror fermions and top partner , where the t - even top partner @xmath7 can contribute to the @xmath4 process .",
    "furthermore , some higgs couplings are modified at the high order and this effect can also influence the process @xmath8 . by performing the detailed analysis on the process",
    "@xmath4 may provide a good opportunity to probe the lht signal . at the lhc",
    ", the @xmath0-channel process dominates amongst these production modes and the related work has been studied in the littlest higgs model@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on @xmath0-channel process and investigate the observability of @xmath4 with sequent decays @xmath9 and @xmath10 at 14 tev lhc in the lht model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we give a brief review of the lht model related to our work .",
    "in sec.iii we calculate the @xmath0-channel process of @xmath4 at the lhc and explore the observability by performing a parton - level simulation .",
    "finally , we give a summary in sec.iv .",
    "the lht model was based on a non - linear @xmath11 model describing an @xmath12 symmetry breaking , with the global group @xmath13 being spontaneously broken into @xmath14 by a @xmath15 symmetric tensor at the scale @xmath16(tev ) .    in the top yukawa sector , in order to cancel the large radiative correction to higgs mass parameter induced by top quark , an additional top partner @xmath7 is introduced , which is even under t - parity and transforms as a singlet under @xmath17 .",
    "the implementation of t - parity requires a t - odd mirror partner @xmath18 . for the top yukawa interaction , one can write down the following @xmath13 and t - parity invariant lagrangian@xcite : @xmath19 u_{r_+ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\lambda_2 f ( \\bar{u}_{l_1 } u_{r_1}+\\bar{u}_{l_2 } u_{r_2 } ) + { \\rm h.c .",

    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 are @xmath31 singlets .",
    "the heavy quark @xmath7 mix with the sm top - quark and leads to a modification of the top quark couplings relatively to the sm .",
    "the mixing can be parameterized by dimensionless ratio @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two dimensionless top quark yukawa couplings .",
    "this mixing parameter can also be used by @xmath35 with @xmath36    their masses up to @xmath37 are given by @xmath38\\\\ & & m_{t_{+}}=\\frac{f}{v}\\frac{m_{t}}{\\sqrt{x_{l}(1-x_{l})}}\\left[1+\\frac{v^{2}}{f^{2}}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}-x_{l}(1-x_{l})\\right)\\right]\\\\ & & m_{t_{-}}=\\frac{f}{v}\\frac{m_{t}}{\\sqrt{x_{l}}}\\left[1+\\frac{v^{2}}{f^{2}}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{2}x_{l}(1-x_{l})\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 gev is the sm higgs vev .",
    "some typical higgs couplings involved in our calculations are given by @xmath41,\\\\ & & v_{ht\\bar{t}_{+}}=-m_{t}\\left[\\frac{(1-x_{l})}{f}p_{r}-\\frac{\\sqrt{x_{l}}}{v\\sqrt{1-x_{l}}}p_{l}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are chirality projection operators .",
    "the higgs coupling with down - type quarks have two different cases@xcite , namely case a and case b.",
    "in the lht model , the lowest - order feynman diagrams of the process @xmath44 are shown in fig.[thjlht ] .",
    "we can see that the t - even heavy quark @xmath7 contributes this process through the fig.[thjlht](c ) . in our calculations ,",
    "the conjugate process @xmath45 has been considered , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we compute the cross sections using the @xmath46@xcite ( and checked against those obtained by @xmath47@xcite ) , where the cteq6l @xcite is used as the parton distribution function and the renormalization scale @xmath48 and factorization scale @xmath49 is set to be @xmath50 .",
    "the relevant sm input parameters are taken as follows @xcite : @xmath51    the relative correction of the cross section can be defined as @xmath52 in our calculations , the leading - order cross sections for the processes @xmath53 in the sm are taken as @xmath54fb and @xmath55fb .",
    "our results show that the features of the process @xmath53 are very similar for the case a and case b , so here we focus on the case a scenario .",
    "the lht parameters related to our calculations are the scale @xmath56 and the ratio @xmath57 . considering the consistent constraints in refs.@xcite",
    ", we require the scale @xmath56 and the ratio @xmath57 to vary in the range @xmath58 gev@xmath59 gev and @xmath60 .",
    "combined with the global fit of the current higgs data and the electroweak precision observables(ewpo ) in ref.@xcite , the confidence regions ( corresponding to @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ranges for case a ) are provided in figs.([dcross8],[dcross14 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , according to refs.@xcite , we can see that the constraints on the lht parameters from the dark matter observations are weaker than the higgs data and ewpo at @xmath62 level , which means that the parameter space allowed by the higgs data and ewpo can also satisfy the dark matter constraints .    in fig.[dcross8 ] and fig.[dcross14 ] , we show the relative corrections @xmath64 of the processes @xmath53 at the 8 and 14 tev lhc in the lht model , respectively . from the fig.[dcross8 ] and fig.[dcross14 ]",
    ", we can see that the relative corrections @xmath64 of @xmath53 at 8 and 14 tev lhc can be respectively reach 38% and 65% at 2@xmath11 level .",
    "we find that these large corrections mainly come from the resonance decay of the heavy quark @xmath7 in the fig.[thjlht](c ) .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the relative corrections @xmath64 are negative in considerable regions for 8 tev lhc and non - negligible regions for 14 tev lhc .",
    "the main reasons are as follows :    due to the small coupling @xmath65 , the main contribution to the @xmath53 comes from fig.[thjlht](a , c ) .",
    "if we take no account of the heavy quark @xmath7 , we can see that the couplings @xmath66 and @xmath67 have the opposite sign so that the contributions of fig.[thjlht](a ) and fig.[thjlht](c ) cancel each other . according to the eq.(10 ) , we can see that the left - handed part ( @xmath68 ) of the coupling @xmath69 has the same sign as the coupling @xmath66 so that their contributions enhance each other . the same thing happens between the right - handed part ( @xmath70 ) of the coupling @xmath69 and the coupling @xmath67 . as a result ,",
    "the total contribution induced by the top partner @xmath7 depends on the surplus after the cancelation between @xmath71 contribution and @xmath72 contribution .",
    "one can notice that the left - handed coupling @xmath73 is proportional to the ratio @xmath57 and dominates the contribution from the heavy quark @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the higgs couplings in the lht model are modified at @xmath37 , which can decrease the @xmath3 cross section . combining these factors above",
    ", we can see that the large relative corrections @xmath64 come from the region that has small @xmath56 , small @xmath74 and large @xmath71 .",
    "by contrast , the small or negative relative corrections @xmath75 come from the region that has large @xmath56 , large @xmath74 , small @xmath71 or the combination of them . due to the lower centre - of - mass energy ,",
    "the relative corrections @xmath75 at 8 tev lhc are suppressed by the large @xmath74 more strongly so that the negative @xmath76 regions are larger compared to the case for 14 tev lhc .",
    "furthermore , for the same ratio @xmath57 , we can see that the relative corrections @xmath75 of @xmath53 at 8 and 14 tev lhc both decrease with the scale @xmath56 increasing , which means that the lht effect decouples with the scale @xmath56 increasing .    in the following calculations",
    ", we will perform a simple parton - level simulation and explore the sensitivity of 14 tev lhc through the channel @xmath77 , the signal is characterised by @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the light jets and @xmath80 .",
    "the most relevant backgrounds can be divided into two classes :    \\(i ) reducible backgrounds , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ;    \\(ii ) irreducible backgrounds , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "signal and background events have been generated at the parton level using @xmath85 , the subsequent simulations are performed by @xmath86@xcite . to simulate @xmath87-tagging , we take moderate single @xmath87-tagging efficiency @xmath88 for @xmath87-jets in the final state .",
    "we also include charm mistag probability @xmath89 and light jet mistag probability @xmath90 in the reducible backgrounds@xcite .",
    "follow the analysis on @xmath2 signature by atlas and cms collaborations@xcite at the lhc run - i , we chose the basic cuts as follows : @xmath91    after basic cuts , the signal is overwhelmed by the backgrounds . in order to reduce the contributions of the backgrounds and enhance the signal contribution ,",
    "some additional cuts are required and some other kinematic distributions are needed . as an example , we display the normalised distributions of @xmath92 in the signal and backgrounds at 14 tev lhc for @xmath93 gev , @xmath94 in fig.[mm ] , where @xmath95 is the total transverse hadronic energy , @xmath96 is pseudorapidity of the leading jet , @xmath97 is the invariant mass of the two @xmath87-jets from the higgs boson decay and @xmath98 is the missing transverse energy .",

    "so we require the events to satisfy @xmath105 gev to isolate the signal and find all the backgrounds are suppressed effectively .",
    "after this cut , the backgrounds are still much larger than the signal , especially the two reducible backgrounds @xmath106 and @xmath107 . according to the @xmath96 distribution",
    ", we can see that most events of @xmath106 and @xmath107 have a leading jet in the central region , which differs significantly from the signal , so we apply the cut @xmath108 to further suppress the @xmath106 and @xmath107 backgrounds .",
    "another effective cut which can suppress the backgrounds is the invariant mass cut on the two @xmath87-jets from the higgs boson decay .",
    "the @xmath87 quark from the top decay can be selected with high purity by choosing the smallest invariant masses @xmath109 of each @xmath87-jet and the lepton among the three combinations@xcite .",
    "the other two @xmath87 quarks are then considered the @xmath87 quarks coming from the higgs boson decay .",
    "we find that the signal peak of @xmath97 is more narrow than those of the backgrounds , so we use the cut @xmath110 gev to enhance the observability of the signal .",
    "besides , we apply the cut @xmath111 gev to further isolate the signal and find that the @xmath107 background is suppressed effectively . after all cuts above ,",
    "the background is dominated by @xmath107 completely due to an extra hard jet with @xmath106 .    for easy reading",
    "we summarize the cut - flow cross sections of the signal and backgrounds for 14 tev lhc in table.[cutflow ] . for comparison , we chose four sets of benchmark points , that is ( @xmath93 gev , @xmath112),(@xmath93 gev , @xmath113,(@xmath114 gev , @xmath112 ) and ( @xmath114 gev , @xmath94 ) , they are arranged in the top - left(top - right ) and bottom - left(bottom - right ) part of one cell , respectively .",
    "due to the resonance effect of the top partner @xmath7 , the values of the cuts , mainly the @xmath104 and @xmath115 cuts , need to be changed with the top partner mass in order to better suppress the backgrounds . from the table.[mtp ] , we can see that the larger @xmath74 will correspond to the larger @xmath104 and @xmath115 cuts .",
    "because of the approximate @xmath74 , the same values of @xmath104 ( or @xmath115 ) cuts are taken for the benchmark points ( @xmath93 gev , @xmath112 ) and ( @xmath93 gev , @xmath113 in our simulation , and so are the benchmark points ( @xmath114 gev , @xmath112 ) and ( @xmath114 gev , @xmath94 ) .",

[ cols=\">,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    in order to analyze the observability , we calculate the signal - to - background ratio according to @xmath116 and the systematic significance @xmath117 for the luminosity @xmath118fb@xmath103 , where @xmath119 represents the number of signal events and @xmath120 represents the number of background events . from table.[cutflow ] , we can see that @xmath116 and @xmath117 are substantially improved by these selected cuts , where the signal - to - background ratio @xmath116 can reach 3.6@xmath11 and systematic significance @xmath117 can reach 53.5% for @xmath93 gev , @xmath94",
    ". moreover , it s worth noting that the systematic significance @xmath117 is enhanced obviously , which will help to draw the signal from the backgrounds .",
    "in the framework of the lht model , we investigate the @xmath0-channel process of @xmath4 at 8 and 14 tev lhc . with current constraints , we find that the cross section can be enhanced obviously in some parameter space compared to the sm predictions .",
    "we further investigate the observability of @xmath4 with decays @xmath9 and @xmath10 at 14 tev lhc for some benchmark points . by performing a simple parton - level simulation ,",
