    "a super - radiant phase transition ( srpt ) , i.e. , a spontaneous appearance of ( static ) coherent amplitude of transverse electromagnetic fields in the thermal equilibrium due to the light - matter interaction , was first proposed theoretically around 1970 @xcite .",

    "srpts are phase transitions in the thermal equilibrium . since the first proposals @xcite , its absence ( no - go theorem ) in atomic systems has been discussed based on the so - called @xmath0 term @xcite , @xmath1 term @xcite , gauge - invariance @xcite , and minimal - coupling hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "influences of the longitudinal dipole - dipole interaction have also been discussed recently @xcite .",
    "srpts require ultra - strong light - matter interactions @xcite",
    ", i.e. , the interaction strength ( vacuum rabi splitting or absorption / emission rate in single - photon level ) must be comparable to or larger than frequencies of electromagnetic waves and of transitions in matters . in recent years , the ultra - strong interactions",
    "have been realized experimentally in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "however , srpts are not yet observed experimentally in the thermal equilibrium , while non - equilibrium analogues were proposed theoretically @xcite and observed experimentally in cold atoms driven by laser light @xcite .    instead of the atomic systems @xcite , which are basically described by the minimal - coupling hamiltonian @xcite , the possibility of the thermal - equilibrium srpts in superconducting circuits",
    "@xcite has been discussed @xcite , and a candidate of circuit structure with coupling through inductance was proposed recently @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of srpts is a decrease of the zero - point energy in the whole system due to the light - matter interaction @xcite .",
    "chemical reactions @xcite and work functions @xcite were reported to be modified by the ultra - strong interaction with the vacuum electromagnetic fields .",
    "the free energy , i.e. , thermodynamic behaviors at finite temperatures , should also be modified as suggested in ref .",

    "@xcite , an external magnetic flux bias or @xmath2 junctions @xcite are inevitable for realizing the srpt in the thermal - equilibrium .",
    "the external magnetic flux increases the zero - point energy of the circuit . while the zero - point energy is certainly decreased by the increase in the photon - atom interaction strength , it can not be lower than the one in the absence of the external magnetic flux .",
    "it is still open to dispute whether there is a lower bound of the zero - point energy in superconducting circuits .",
    "if there exists a superconducting circuit showing a srpt without the external magnetic flux or @xmath2 junctions , the zero - point energy should be purely decreased by increasing the strength of the interaction with the transverse electromagnetic fields , and the thermodynamic properties , e.g. , the superconducting transition temperature , of the circuit might be modified .    in order to find such a circuit structure , in this paper ,",
    "we show some hopeless circuit configurations where srpts are absent even in the presence of an external magnetic flux or @xmath2 junctions .",
