    "the bright ap star @xmath0  cvn is a member of the class of chemically peculiar stars which also exhibit a strong globally ordered magnetic field .",
    "these chemical peculiarities are exhibited as global over and underabundances relative to the sun and as lateral abundance nonuniformities that have been described in the literature as spots or rings of over / under abundance , but can also be more complex ( e.g lftinger et al .",
    "2003 , kochukhov et al .",
    "2004 and rice et al .",
    "abundances are also reported to vary vertically through the atmosphere in a significant way .",
    "these abundance anomalies are believed to result principally from atomic diffusion in the atmosphere of the star ( michaud 1970 ) .",
    "michaud showed that if the atmosphere of a star is sufficiently stable , diffusion under the competing influence of gravity and radiation pressure can occur .",
    "the additional presence of the magnetic field strongly influences energy and mass transport ( e.g. , diffusion , convection and weak stellar winds ) within the atmosphere of a star , and results in strong chemical abundance non - uniformities in photospheric layers ( e.g. , turcotte 2003 ) .",
    "magnetic fields have been shown to modify diffusion in two ways .",
    "first , charged particles are strongly constrained to follow field lines .",
    "this can result in the magnetic field modifying the diffusion velocity ( alecian & stift 2006 ) .",
    "secondly , radiative accelerations are also modified by zeeman desaturation ( magnetically induced spectral line desaturation ) and splitting of absorption lines ( alecian & stift 2006 ) .",
    "even with a theoretical framework for the formation of abundance anomalies , very few observational studies have been made of ap stars using chemical abundance mapping combined with magnetic field topology analysis from the same data ( from medium to high resolution observations ) . with the exception of previous work on @xmath0  cvn ( the subject of the present paper ) ,",
    "notable examples include magnetic doppler imaging of 53 cam ( kochukhov et al .",
    "2004 ) and mapping of the roap star hd 24712 ( lftinger et al .",
    "examples of abundance doppler imaging with a comparison to independent model of the magnetic field geometry include oxygen abundance structures mapped for the star @xmath3 aur by rice et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , multiple element mapping of @xmath4 uma by lftinger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and mapping of the roap star hd 83368 by kochukhov et al .",
    "a more recent example of abundance mapping performed ( without simultaneously deriving the magnetic field ) is hd 3980 ( nesvacil et al .",
    "2012 ) . in these studies , with the exception of a handful of cases , no clear correlations could be found between the magnetic field topology and the horizontal structures of most chemical elements .",
    "this was interpreted as a lack of up to date theoretical models predicting the formation of horizontal abundance structures .",
    "with such a small sample size there is still limited understanding of the interplay between specific chemical species in the photosphere and the magnetic field of ap stars .",
    "a new magnetic map of the bright ap star @xmath0  cvn was reconstructed by silvester et al .",
    "( 2014 ) using stokes @xmath1 observations obtained with espadons and narval spectropolarimeters described by silvester et al .",
    "we demonstrated that the magnetic topology we derived agreed with that of kochukhov & wade ( 2010 ) which used data taken a decade earlier .",
    "importantly , we showed that the a similar magnetic field topology could be obtained by mapping different atomic line sets , with the only differences seen between the meridional field components .",
    "mapping of the distributions of the surface chemical abundances of several elements for @xmath0  cvn using stokes @xmath2 was performed by kochukhov at al .",
    "( 2002 ) , allowing a comparison between the local field properties and local photospheric chemistry .",
    "these original maps were limited by the small wavelength coverage of the sofin spectrograph and a lack of a detailed model of the field topology , which generally can not be derived from stokes @xmath2 alone ( kochukhov at al .",
    "2002 , kochukhov and wade 2010 ) . with the new spectropolarimetric ( stokes @xmath1 ) observations described by silvester et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , we will now investigate the chemical abundance structures of @xmath0  cvn at a level of detail not previously possible , in particular due the increased wavelength coverage . by mapping the chemical surface structures of @xmath0  cvn and comparing them to our updated magnetic map ,",
    "we hope to further our understanding of how different chemical species are affected by the characteristics of the magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section 2 briefly describes the observations , section 3 discusses the procedure for selecting lines suitable for chemical abundance mapping . in section 4",
    "we discuss the chemical abundance maps and the implications of these maps .",
    "finally we summarise our findings in the conclusion .",
    "observations of @xmath0 cvn were obtained between 2006 and 2010 , with both espadons and narval spectropolarimeters .",
    "the full details of the observations and reduction are reported by silvester et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , along with the log of observations . for this study only stokes @xmath2 profiles were used for abundance mapping due to the fact that the linear polarisation signatures were generally too weak for most of the studied elements to be useful for mapping .",

    "in an attempt to more quantitatively investigate potential correlations between the abundance and magnetic field structures we produced a series of scatter plots of abundance values at each surface element ( for the visible part of the stellar surface ) as a function of different magnetic field properties at the same surface element ( the magnetic field modulus , the horizontal magnetic field and the radial magnetic field ) .",
    "the resulting scatter plots however did not reveal any clear correlations and provided no significant information in addition to that already recovered by visual comparison of the abundance structure and magnetic field maps .",
    "an example of such a scatter plot is shown for the iron abundance in fig [ scatter ] .",
    "an additional test was to seek evidence of temporal evolution of abundance structures using eu  ii lines reported by by farnsworth ( 1932 ) and our new observations .",
    "farnsworth utilised equivalent width measurements of eu  ii lines to determine the rotational period of @xmath0  cvn .",
    "we used a selection of the same eu  ii lines ( eu  ii @xmath5 4132 , 4205 and 6645 ) and measured the equivalent width of these lines at each phase .",
    "the equivalent widths were plotted as a function of phase using the rotational ephemeris determined by farnsworth ( 1932 ) .",
    "we find the maximum equivalent width generally occurs at zero phase within the effective measurement uncertainties , in agreement with farnsworth(1932 ) .",
    "this result indicates that there is no evidence for large - scale eu spot evolution in @xmath0  cvn .",
    "our additional tests also show that there is no evidence for evolution of the detailed surface abundance structure over a decade timescale , and no change int he large - scale distribution of eu since 1932 .",
    "we presented a slightly modified and updated magnetic field map of @xmath0 cvn which was required to improve the fit between the model line profiles and observed line profiles in stokes @xmath6 for the elements oxygen and chlorine .",
    "we adopted this magnetic map as our fixed field map in all our inversions .",
    "this new magnetic map which was reconstructed using a lower value of magnetic field regularisation than used by silvester et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , is similar to what is seen by silvester et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , with an additional small magnetic spot - like region seen at phase 0.00 .",
    "the inclusion of oxygen and chlorine resulted in this new structures seen at phase 0.00 .",
    "overall we find that this updated map does not change the findings of silvester et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "silvester et al .",
    "( 2014 ) used the constraint that we only included lines with clear stokes @xmath7 signatures in the inversions , thus lines such as oxygen and chlorine were not considered .",
    "it should be noted that the map that derived by silvester et al .",
    "( 2014 ) is not what we would consider the ultimate magnetic field map of @xmath0 cvn , rather the most realistic representation of the magnetic field taking into account the aforementioned constraint .",
    "one consideration we did not previously take into account , was to include lines which exhibited strong abundance structures at opposing phases , where elements sample the stellar surface in a different way .",
    "the resulting chemical abundance maps can be classified into distinct groups ; those that accumulate close to the negative pole or the negative part of the radial field and those that are located near the stellar equator where the field is close to a field modulus value of around 2 kg .",
    "the results are summarised in table [ abundance - table ] .    the elements oxygen , chlorine and europium exhibit one large enhanced abundance structure seen between phases 0.80 to 0.20 .",
    "this location correlates to the negative radial field .",
    "the praseodymium abundance structure is similar to that of oxygen , chlorine and europium , but with an 0.20 phase offset and with a second enhanced structure .",
    "these praseodymium structures appear to only align with the negative radial magnetic field .",
    "unlike the other five elements studied , these elements show enhanced abundances only near the negative radial field and not in the areas of the field which have a strong positive radial component .",
    "furthermore both europium and praseodymium have low abundance areas which trace the magnetic equator .",
    "rice et al .",
    "( 2004 ) studied the distribution of oxygen on the surface of the ap star @xmath3 aur and found that oxygen was lower in abundance around the magnetic equator and enhanced in bands around the magnetic poles . for the ap star hd 3980 nesvacil at al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that in the case of oxygen there were circular areas of high abundance around both magnetic poles and that the abundance was depleted around the magnetic equator . in the case of the roap",
    "hd 83368 ( kochukhov et al . 2004 ) they found oxygen enhanced at the magnetic equator .",
    "none of these studies found oxygen located only on one magnetic pole .",
    "chlorine has rarely been mapped in an ap star .",
    "kochukhov at al .",
    "( 2002 ) mapped chlorine on @xmath0 cvn and found a very similar distribution for chlorine as we find . for hd 3980 nesvacil et al .",
    "( 2012 ) report that the europium enhancement is located in spots between the magnetic poles and the magnetic equator . in the case of praseodymium they found high abundance regions in the area of the magnetic poles , in our case we find the areas of high abundance are located on the negative radial component and not the positive component of the field .",
    "iron and chromium were found to have depleted abundance at areas where the magnetic field is weakest and the higher abundance features trace the areas of the magnetic field where the magnetic field modulus is on the order of 2 kg .",
    "this is somewhat consistent with what was found for cr and fe in hd 3980 where enhancements were found around the poles and the stellar equator ( nesvacil at al .",
    "2012 ) and for @xmath4 uma ( lftinger et al . 2003 ) where both cr and fe were enhanced at the poles .    in the case of the elements silicon ,",
    "titanium and neodymium the higher abundance areas are broadly distributed around the region where the field modulus is around 2.0 kg , but unlike chromium and iron the depleted abundance regions are larger and cover the lower half of the stellar sphere at most phases , where the field is consistently weak .",
    "looking to previous studies , we find no clear correlation for these elements .",
    "nesvacil et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found for silicon on hd 3980 that areas of overabundance were located at various spots along the rotational equator between the magnetic poles and magnetic equator . in the case of titanium ,",
    "lftinger et al . ( 2003 ) found that titanium in @xmath4 uma was accumulated around the magnetic equator .",
    "neodymium on hd 3980 was found to be concentrated at the magnetic poles and depleted at the magnetic equator ( nesvacil et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "it is clear from our derived abundance maps that the magnetic field has an influence on the formation of horizontal abundance structure for all elements , but by looking at previous mapping result with the exception of fe and cr , there appears no clear correlation between our result and results for other ap stars . in particular given elements",
    "do nt correlate to the same magnetic field regions between respective studies .",
    "michaud et al .",
    "( 1981 ) predicted that in the absence of turbulence , rare earth elements should be concentrated where the magnetic field is horizontal ( magnetic equator ) and iron should be enhanced where the field is vertical ( magnetic poles ) .",
    "this is not clearly seen in our maps . in the case of the elements europium and praseodymium",
    "they are depleted at the magnetic equator and not enhanced . whilst iron and chromium are enhanced near the poles ,",
    "the region of enhancement is much larger , almost to the magnetic equator in some cases . for silicon alecian & vauclair ( 1981 )",
    "predicted that enhancements will be seen at the magnetic equator .",
    "again this is not seen in our maps , with silicon being distributed over a large area .",
    "alecian & stift ( 2010 ) comment that if the magnetic field of a star is not purely dipolar , the proposed belt - like enhancements of some elements at the magnetic equator may be too small to be detectable using current doppler mapping techniques and would result in the appearance of spots in these regions instead .",
    "such spots are not seen in our maps at the magnetic equator .",
    "it is also interesting to note that we do nt find any abundance structures for any of the elements studied which we can directly relate to the small - scale structures of the magnetic field modulus .",
    "this all suggests that important details are missing from the theory relating to the formation of horizontal abundance structures and the magnetic field and that a better understanding of the vertical abundance structure and the impact the magnetic field has on this structure , is ultimately required .",
    "our additional tests also show that there is no evidence for abundance structure variability over a decade timescale . to obtain further observational constraints",
    ", it would be useful to map additional ap stars .",
    "this will be investigated in future papers using the stokes @xmath1 data of other ap stars , in part collected by silvester et al .",
    "in addition mapping the roap star hd 24712 in stokes @xmath1 ( by rusomarov et al .",
    "2013 ) is ongoing , which could potentially give additional constraints .",
