    "the legendrian curves @xmath60 , put in different pages ( so that @xmath61 comes first and @xmath62 last ) , produce the @xmath63 component legendrian link as we draw in figure [ fig : csd_local ] ( a ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath64 in the factorization ( [ eqn : factbraid ] ) gives a sequence of dehn twists @xmath65 in the factorization ( [ eqn : factphi ] ) , which produce the @xmath63 component legendrian unlink as we draw in figure [ fig : csd_local ] ( b ) .",
    "these local contributions of surgery links interact each other , whose linking patterns can be chased by looking the page @xmath28 in figure [ fig : curves ] , as we summarize as follows ( cf .",

    "the contact surgery diagram provides a 4-manifold @xmath76 that bounds @xmath3 . by (",

    "* corollary 3.6 ) disappears since each component of the surgery link has zero rotation number .",
    "let @xmath81 and @xmath82 be the number of positive and negative dehn twist in the factorization ( [ eqn : factbraid ] ) .",
    "since each factor @xmath49 produces @xmath63 @xmath83 contact surgeries along unknots , @xmath84 by bennequin s formula @xmath85 , hence @xmath86      let @xmath89 be the canonical seifert surface of @xmath6 that comes from the factorization ( [ eqn : factbraid2 ] ) .",
    "namely , @xmath90 is made of @xmath24 disks @xmath91 , with twisted bands connecting @xmath92-th and @xmath93-st disk for each @xmath49 in the factorization ( [ eqn : factbraid ] ) .",
    "take a handle decomposition of @xmath90 so that the @xmath96-handle is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the twisted band coming from the @xmath99-th factor @xmath58 of the factorization ( [ eqn : factbraid2 ] ) , and that the 1-handles are the rest of twisted bands .",
    "we put @xmath90 in the 3-space so that the @xmath96-handle is the unit disc in the @xmath100-@xmath101 plane , and that @xmath102-handles are contained in the upper half - space .",
    "then the kirby diagram of @xmath94 is obtained by `` symmetrizing '' the cores of @xmath102-handles of @xmath90 whose framings are determined by the framings of the core of @xmath102-handles . except the simplest case @xmath103 , which we will explictly illustrate later in example [ exam : double ] , the diagram is complicated and it is not easy to draw the whole diagram  however , the contribution of @xmath102-handle in the resulting kirby diagram , and how they interact each other is simple . see figure [ fig : branchcov ] below .      to put @xmath90 in such a convenient position , first we flip the @xmath102st disc @xmath104 , by untwisting the band @xmath105 ( see figure [ fig : sd1](a ) (d ) ) .",
    "this simplifies the @xmath96-handle of @xmath90 , and iterating this flipping procedure , eventually we put @xmath90 in such a convenient position ( see figure [ fig : seifert ] ) . in this process ,",
    "all 1-handles gains negative half twist , so in the final position , the framing of @xmath102-handle is @xmath56 if it comes from positive generator , and is @xmath96 if it comes from negative generator .     into a nice position , by flipping @xmath106 along @xmath105 .",
    "here we draw 1-handle by a line with @xmath107-sign coming from coresponding generator @xmath108 .",
    "the gray box inside @xmath107 represents positive and negative half twist.,width=491 ]        [ obs : handlenest ] the @xmath102-handles @xmath110 and @xmath111 of @xmath90 , coming from the @xmath68-th and @xmath70-th factor @xmath69 and @xmath71 in the factorization ( [ eqn : factbraid ] ) ( @xmath112 ) , nest each other in figure [ fig : seifert ] if and only if @xmath113 ( see figure [ fig : handlenest ] )    recall that each component of the contact surgery diagram of @xmath3 has @xmath54 , so @xmath56 and @xmath57 contact surgery corresponds to @xmath114 and @xmath96 topological surgery , respectively .",
    "hence each factor @xmath49 in ( [ eqn : factbraid ] ) contributes the same @xmath63 components framed link in the surgery diagram of @xmath76 and @xmath94 ( compare figure [ fig : csd_local ] and figure [ fig : branchcov ] ) .",
    "moreover , from observation [ obs : cslink ] and observation [ obs : handlenest ] , these local contributions link other part of the diagrams , in exactly the same way ( compare figure [ fig : csd_localnest ] and figure [ fig : branchcov ] ) .",
    "thus , comparisons of the construction of the surgery diagrams for @xmath76 and @xmath94 proves that they are completely the same diagram .",
    "claim [ claim : key ] , together with a well - known fact on tristram - levine signature ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 12.6 ) , for example ) shows @xmath115 the equalities ( [ eqn : conseq1 ] ) and @xmath116 completes the proof .      in the case",
    "@xmath103 , the contact double branched covering , it is much easier to treat and draw the surgery diagram of @xmath76 and @xmath94 . here",
    "we give more explicit illustrations of surgery diagrams .",
    "let @xmath7 be a contact double branched covering branched along the closure of an @xmath24-braid @xmath25 .",
