    "in curved space - times , light is observed to propagate along curved paths . as such , computing mock observations of scenes affected by strong gravity requires taking general relativity fully into account .",
    "a conceptually simple approach in the limit of geometric optics is to compute the paths of light , given by null geodesics .",
    "this can be done numerically or analytically , in the case of highly symmetric space - times such as the kerr space - time .",
    "this approach has been often used in the literature since the late 1960 s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a complete solution of the polarized radiative transfer problem in curved space requires not only solving the geodesic , but solving the general relativistic polarized radiative transfer equation along this geodesic as well .",
    "currently , there are several codes capable of computing general relativistic polarized radiative transfer : grtrans @xcite , astroray @xcite and the code described by @xcite . however",
    ", none of codes above support arbitrary space - time metrics , and are instead restricted to the kerr metric .",
    "to remedy this , we have developed arcmancer ( pihajoki et al . 2017 , _ in prep _ ) : a c++ library for computing geodesics and polarized radiative transfer in space - times with arbitrary user defined metrics . in the following",
    ", we will briefly describe the general relativistic polarized radiation transfer problem and show some promising initial results .",
    "to compute radiative transfer along the path of light , given by the null geodesic @xmath0 , we need to first solve it numerically .",
    "a geodesic can be given as a curve @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the space - time manifold , which satisfies the equations of motion .",
    "the equations of motion can be given in two complementary forms .",
    "for initial conditions @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the initial position and @xmath5 is the initial tangent vector of the geodesic , given on the tangent bundle , we have in a coordinate frame @xmath6 where we define @xmath7 , and where @xmath8 is the affine parameter of the geodesic , @xmath9 is the metric and @xmath10 are the christoffel symbols of the first kind . for initial conditions @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the initial four - momentum of the geodesic , given on the cotangent bundle , we can define a hamiltonian @xmath13 and the hamiltonian equations of motion a coordinate frame as @xmath14 the two different parametrizations are connected by the natural bijection @xmath15 .",
    "however , it should be noted that when plasma effects can not be ignored , the path of light is not given by a geodesic following the dispersion relation , but a dispersion relation depending on the polarization and local properties of the plasma @xcite .",
    "these effects are not important for the applications presented in this paper , so we can safely ignore them here .    to compute polarized radiative transfer along a geodesic , we first need to fix a polarization frame along each point of the geodesic , and connect these frames to the polarization frame at the point of observation .",
    "conceptually the simplest method is to define a frame of two four - vectors @xmath16 , representing local horizontal and vertical directions , in the spatial subspace of the observer , who is assumed to move with a four - velocity @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are orthogonal with respect to each other as well as with respect to to the tangent vector of the geodesic , @xmath20 , they define a proper polarization frame .",
    "this frame can then be parallel propagated along the geodesic to obtain a well defined polarization frame at each point of the geodesic .",
    "next , the redshift @xmath21 between a point on the geodesic and the observation point is given by @xmath22 where @xmath20 is the tangent vector of the geodesic , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the observed and emitted frequencies , @xmath25 and @xmath17 are the observer and emitter four - velocities , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the observation and emission points , respectively .",
    "finally , we need a relativistic generalization of the flat space radiative transfer equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the physical distance through the medium , @xmath30 is the stokes vector , @xmath31 is the vector of corresponding emissivities and @xmath32 is the mller matrix containing the absorption coefficients @xmath33 and the faraday conversion and mixing coefficients @xmath34 for the various stokes parameters .",
    "when the four - velocity of the local medium ( i.e.  astrophysical plasma ) and a polarization reference direction @xmath35 ( given e.g.  by the local direction of the magnetic field @xmath36 ) is specified , we can use the parallel propagated polarization frame of the observer to generalize equation  , yielding @xmath37 which are in general functions of frequency @xmath24 , the angle @xmath38 between the four - velocity @xmath20 of the geodesic and the local reference direction @xmath35 , and the angle @xmath39 between the parallel propagated polarization frame and the local reference polarization frame , projected orthogonal to @xmath20 .",
    "see @xcite for details",
    ". given initial conditions for the intensity @xmath40 , the emissivity @xmath41 , the response tensor @xmath42 , the local four - velocity @xmath17 and the local polarization reference direction @xmath35 on all points of a geodesic , equation can be numerically integrated along the geodesic , yielding the solution to the general relativistic polarized radiative transfer problem .",
    "the equations described above have been implemented in the arcmancer library . using the library we can compute results to some example problems .",
    "figure  [ fig : polcomp ] shows the comparison between numerical and analytic results to two examples of polarized radiative transfer problems in minkowskian flat space .",
