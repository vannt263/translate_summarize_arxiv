    "the science of  self - assembly \" , as introduced by george whitesides and coworkers about fifteen years ago @xcite as a promising research direction , is a large and rapidly growing field of tremendous technological potential and fundamental interest .",
    "its motivating factor is simple : direct micro- and nano - fabrication of circuitry ( electronic , optoelectronic , or others ) becomes prohibitively time - consuming and/or expensive below a certain length scale , and as a result , scientists and engineers are searching for particles on the mesoscopic scale that by themselves assemble into potentially useful structures by virtue of their mutual interactions ; hence the term ` self - assembly ' .",
    "there is a large number of examples of theoretical , experimental , and computational studies on this topic @xcite .",
    "colloidal systems command particular interest , as interaction potentials in these systems have become increasingly tailorable with the advent of new ways to functionalize the colloidal surface .",
    "these systems have tremendous capacity to assemble exotic lattices and hence to yield photonic bandgap structures .",
    "in particular , the diamond lattice is known to have a pronounced photonic bandgap @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we obtain the fundamentally and technologically important result that the three - dimensional diamond and wurtzite structures can self - assemble with isotropic interactions possessing a stronly repulsive core , and present the corresponding potential functions , which have been derived using optimization techniques developed previously @xcite .",
    "specifically , we show that an @xmath0-body classical system with particles interacting via one of our derived isotropic potentials has as its ground state the corresponding lattice , in a specific volume ( or density ) range . unlike previous attempts to solve this problem , we come to this conclusion only after satisfying several important criteria : ( 1 ) lattice sums show that there is a positive pressure range in which the given lattice is stable ; ( 2 ) all crystal normal mode frequencies are real at specific volume @xmath1 ; ( 3 ) defects ( vacancies and interstitials ) are shown to cost the system energy ; and ( 4 ) the system self - assembles in a molecular dynamics simulation that starts above the freezing point and is slowly cooled . in ( 4 ) , the system may start from an entirely random configuration or with a layer of fixed particles to promote epitaxial growth .",
    "hence we make the important distinction here between homogeneous and heterogenous nucleation in self - assembly .",
    "it is of course a more stringent requirement that the desired lattice self - assemble from a random configuration ( homogeneous ) .",
    "we find that the diamond crystal assembles from a completely random configuration , but the wurtzite crystal requires an epitaxial layer for it to do so ( heterogeneous ) .",
    "the importance of criterion ( 4 ) to establish a ground state structure has been generally overlooked in previous work . currently , most studies rely exclusively on criteria ( 1 ) and/or ( 2 ) to determine lattice stability .",
    "the only result that is guaranteed by satisfying ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is that the structure is a local minimum , not a global one .",
    "computationally , the only practical way that one can ensure that the desired target structure is the ground state is by doing the cooling and annealing step , ( 4 ) .",
    "however , if the presumed ground state is not achieved by an annealing , it does not necessarily imply that it is not the ground state if the resulting energy of the structure produced exceeds that of the target structure .",
    "there may simply be a kinetic bottleneck that prevents the annealing process from finding the ground state in a reasonable amount of computer time .",
    "the approach by theorists and experimentalists towards finding complex self - assembling materials has primarily been _ edisonian _",
    "( i.e. , trial - and - error ) in nature rather than being systematic and deductive .",
    "motivated by the increasing control that experimentalists have over interparticle interactions , in colloids in particular , we have previously derived a systematic procedure to optimize these interactions to produce desired structures .",
    "this is an example of `` inverse statistical mechanics '' : instead of using the interactions in a system to find the resulting behavior , we target a particular behavior ( e.g. structure ) , and derive optimal interactions to yield such a result .",
    "we have recently applied these schemes to two - dimensional monodisperse , isotropic systems @xcite , and in the present paper , we use one of these methods , the so - called `` zero - temperature scheme '' , to derive isotropic interaction potentials that permit the self - assembly of the diamond and wurtzite lattices respectively .",
    "the self - assembly of any low - coordinated target structure in three dimensions is considerably more challenging than in two dimensions because the number of possible competing structures grows dramatically with increasing dimension .    with the exception of the so - called patchy particles @xcite , colloidal interactions are isotropic , and",
    "thus we believe it is a technologically relevant as well as theoretically intriguing question to ask : what are the limits of isotropic interaction potentials for self - assembly ?",
    "our discovery adds to fundamental understanding of the nature of the solid state by showing that isotropic interactions enable the self - assembly of crystal structures with a much broader range of coordination numbers than previously thought .",
    "the self - assembly of a diamond lattice of dielectric spheres has been something of a holy grail in colloid science , since it was found that in the diamond lattice , unlike in the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) and body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattices , for example , there exists a bandgap in the photonic spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is the central necessary condition for and enabler of photonic circuitry , since this property allows control over passage vs. blockage of light , in analogy to how transistors control electric current @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there has been recent work on icosahedral quasicrystals as desirable photonic bandgap structures @xcite . while this is a promising avenue of research",
    ", its central stumbling block is that self - assembly of quasicrystals in three dimensions is extremely difficult .",
    "indeed , a single defect destroys strict quasicrystallinity .",
    "furthermore , there is an ongoing controversy over whether a quasicrystal can be assembled using only local information .",
    "the diamond - structure potential we find is radially complex , and seemingly difficult to fabricate in the lab directly .",
    "that said , technology that allows experimentalists to control colloidal and nanoparticle interaction has been advancing significantly in recent years , with dna functionalization @xcite , for example , becoming a very useful method .",
    "furthermore , radial complexity in the interaction potential is found in potentials of mean force @xcite .",
    "recently , experimentalists have observed diamond - like behavior in mixed silver and gold nanoparticle systems @xcite , however the precise form of the interparticle interaction potential is currently unknown .",
    "watzlawek , likos , and lwen ( wls ) have devised an isotropic interaction potential that models star polymer systems , with good agreement with experiment @xcite . in particular , the wls group has found , for certain of their parameters , a region of stability for the diamond lattice , and thus an isotropic potential that favors it . the type of potential used in the wls study has a soft core ; in particular , for small @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "while their potential is structurally simpler than the one we present here , it is not a potential that can be considered analogous to those in colloidal systems with present technology because colloidal particles have too hard a core .",
    "we have discovered , in the course of performing optimization runs , that assembling open lattices with hard core potentials requires the potential to have more features than that of the wls potential .",
    "we believe that tetrahedrally coordinated self - assembly via an isotropic potential is a counterintuitive result because conventional wisdom , based on atomic and molecular chemistry , has biased thinking towards the belief that highly anisotropic interactions are necessary for such locally directional structure as in diamond or wurtzite , as in the case of the carbon - carbon covalent bonds in the true diamond crystal .",
    "the present work constitutes a clear demonstration that this chemical intuition is too restrictive .",
    "we have previously found an isotropic potential that causes spontaneous assembly of the 6-fold coordinated simple cubic lattice @xcite , but the tetrahedral lattices present a significantly greater challenge .",
    "finding such potentials is difficult , as the diamond and wurtzite lattices are close structural competitors with one another ( and therefore close in energy for short - ranged potentials ) .    in order to understand how the diamond lattice is energetically distinguished from other lattices ,",
    "consider wurtzite as a competitor to diamond in a system with an isotropic interaction potential . whereas the diamond lattice can be considered as two interlaced fcc lattices ,",
    "the wurtzite is two interlaced hcp lattices .",
    "both are tetrahedrally coordinated .",
    "for the sake of argument , call the nearest neighbor distance @xmath4 in both lattices .",
    "both have 12-fold coordinated neighbors at @xmath5 , but the wurtzite has a single extra neighbor at @xmath6 .",
    "both have neighbors at @xmath7 , but the diamond is 12-fold coordinated there where the wurtzite is 9-fold .",
    "it is evident that energetically differentiating between these two lattices ( and causing one to self - assemble in a simulation rather than the other ) using an isotropic , short ranged potential is challenging .",
    "table 1 is gives the diamond and wurtzite coordination numbers for their first few coordination shells .",
    "+    .coordination structure of the diamond and wurtzite lattices . here",
    ", we set @xmath4 to be the distance to the nearest neighbor . if both lattices have the same specific volume , @xmath4 for diamond is equal to @xmath4 for wurtzite . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in section ii , we briefly discuss the optimization methodology , and then proceed in section iii to a discussion of the results for the diamond and wurtzite cases . in this section",
    ", we report on all necessary criteria : lattice sums , phonons , defect energies , and md self - assembly .",
    "we also include a discussion of the melting behavior of each crystal .",
    "we conclude in section iv with some final comments about this approach .",
    "the inverse method used to obtain the interaction potentials , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , is discussed extensively in our previous work @xcite , and so will not be discussed here at any length .",
    "it is , however , important to note that this `` zero - temperature scheme '' optimizes the energetic stability of a given target lattice ( in this case , diamond and wurtzite ) , in comparison to competitor lattices ( chosen previously ) , subject to the condition that the target lattice is linearly mechanically stable at an appropriately chosen specific volume ( inverse density ) .",
    "linear stability is tested while the optimization is being carried out by calculating the phonon spectrum , and thus making sure that every normal mode of the crystal , at any given wave vector in the brillouin zone ( bz ) is real .",
    "the competitor lattices used were the fcc , bcc , hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) , simple hexagonal ( shex ) , and simple cubic ( sc ) structures .    of course the optimization scheme for the isotropic interaction can not search over the entire space of functions of a single variable , therefore we choose a suitably normalized , well - motivated family of potentials defined by a finite number of parameters , @xmath10 , and find the set of @xmath11 s that maximizes the energetic difference between the target and competitor lattices subject to the constraint of linear mechanical stability at a particular specific volume .",
    "_ a. diamond _ + in this case , a parameterization was chosen such that the potential has three local minima , with ratios of the positions of the second to the first , and of the third to the first , being @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "these are the exact distance ratios of the neighbors in the diamond lattice .",
    "the target coordination numbers for the first three neighbors are 4 , 12 , and 12 , and thus the first local minimum was constrained to be positive in the parameterization , in order to discriminate against closed packed and the body - centered cubic lattices , which have coordination numbers 12 and 8 respectively .",
    "it should be noted that a number of different parameterizations were attempted , many with simpler functional forms ( i.e. with fewer local minima and maxima ) , but the potential we report here is by all criteria the most suitable .",

    "it is important to note here that this potential defines the energy and length units that we use for this study .",
    "thus , derived quantities , such as pressure and volume , have units determined by the length and energy units of this potential .    in the optimization scheme ,",

    "fifteen molecular dynamics simulations ( at constant number of particles , volume , and energy - microcanonically ) were run in which 216 particles were started from a random configuration at @xmath17 , at a temperature well above the freezing point ( homogeneous case ) . upon slow cooling , all simulations resulted in diamond lattices with differing numbers and types of defects , with 1 of 15 exhibiting no defects whatsoever .",
