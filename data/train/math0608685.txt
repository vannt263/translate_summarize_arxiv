    "relatively hyperbolic groups were introduced by gromov in @xcite , in order to generalize notions such as the fundamental group of a complete , non - compact , finite volume hyperbolic manifold and to give a hyperbolic version of small cancellation theory over free groups by adopting the geometric language of manifolds with cusps .",
    "this notion has been developed by several authors and , in particular , various characterizations of relatively hyperbolic groups have been given ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we should mention here that farb @xcite introduced a weaker notion of relative hyperbolicity for groups , using constructions on their cayley graphs , as well as the bounded coset penetration property , an additional condition which makes his definition equivalent to the other definitions .",
    "we recall here one of bowditch s equivalent definitions ( in the case of infinite  peripheral \" subgroups ) .",
    "a finitely generated group @xmath0 is _ hyperbolic relative to a family of finitely generated subgroups _",
    "@xmath1 if @xmath0 admits a proper , discontinuous and isometric action on a proper , hyperbolic path metric space @xmath2 such that @xmath0 acts on the ideal boundary of @xmath2 as a geometrically finite convergence group and the elements of @xmath3 are the maximal parabolic subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "besides the fundamental groups of hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume , examples of relatively hyperbolic groups are fundamental groups of finite graphs of finitely generated groups with finite edge groups , which are hyperbolic relative to the family of infinite vertex groups ( which may be empty , in which case the group is hyperbolic ) , since their action on the bass - serre tree satisfies definition 2 in @xcite .",
    "another example of relatively hyperbolic groups are limit groups .",
    "the notion of a limit group was introduced by sela @xcite in his solution to tarski s problem for free groups .",
    "as it turned out , the family of limit groups coincides with that of finitely generated fully residually free groups first introduced by baumslag @xcite , and extensively studied by kharlampovich and myasnikov @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", dahmani showed that limit groups are hyperbolic relative to their maximal non - cyclic abelian subgroups ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that each group is relatively hyperbolic to itself .",
    "so , from now on , in order to avoid this trivial situation , _ we assume that all relatively hyperbolic groups properly contain the corresponding maximal parabolic subgroups_.    in @xcite , it was proved that the outer automorphism group of a conjugacy separable hyperbolic group is residually finite .",
    "this is a far - reaching generalization of a classical result of grossman @xcite , which states that the mapping class group of a closed orientable surface is residually finite .",
    "the purpose of this note is to prove the following generalization for relatively hyperbolic groups .",
    "[ thm:1 ] let @xmath0 be a conjugacy separable , relatively hyperbolic group .",
    "then each virtually torsion - free subgroup of the outer automorphism group @xmath4 of @xmath0 is residually finite .    as an application",
    ", we obtain :    [ thm:2 ] let @xmath0 be the fundamental group of a finite graph of groups , such that each edge group is finite and each vertex group is polycyclic - by - finite . then @xmath5 is residually finite .",
    "guirardel and levitt @xcite showed that the outer automorphism group of a limit group is virtually torsion - free .",
    "more recently , chagas and zalesskii @xcite have shown that limit groups are conjugacy separable .",
    "therefore , from theorem [ thm:1 ] , we immediately deduce the following result .",
    "the outer automorphism group of a limit group is residually finite .",
    "a group @xmath0 is _ conjugacy separable _ if for any two non - conjugate elements @xmath6 and @xmath7 of @xmath0 , there is a finite homomorphic image of @xmath0 in which the images of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are not conjugate .",
    "an automorphism @xmath8 of a group @xmath0 is called _ conjugating _ if @xmath9 is conjugate to @xmath10 for each @xmath11 .",
    "the conjugating automorphisms of a group @xmath0 form a subgroup of @xmath12 , which we denote by @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , @xmath13 is a normal subgroup of @xmath12 containing the inner automorphism group @xmath14 of @xmath0 .",
    "the importance of this notion to the study of residual properties of the outer automorphism group of @xmath0 , arises from two facts .",
    "the first is that if @xmath0 is finitely generated and conjugacy separable , then the quotient group @xmath15 is residually finite ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.1 ) ) .",
    "the second is the following short exact sequence @xmath16        [ lem : inequalities ] let @xmath18 be a @xmath19-hyperbolic metric space , let @xmath10 be an isometry of @xmath2 and let @xmath20 be a positive real number such that the set @xmath21 is nonempty .",
    "given a point @xmath22 and a positive number @xmath23 , choose @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "then either @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "we consider a geodesic trianlge with vertices @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath28 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the points on the geodesics @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] , respectively , which are at distance @xmath33 from @xmath7 , where @xmath33 is the gromov product of @xmath6 and @xmath28 with respect to @xmath7 .",

    "* lemma 2.2 ) . in this case instead of the cayley graph of @xmath0 we use the @xmath19-hyperbolic metric space @xmath2 ( in the sense that every geodesic triangle in @xmath2 is @xmath19-thin ) on which @xmath0 acts by isometries . one essential difference between the two proofs is the existence of parabolic isometries in the case of relatively hyperbolic groups .",
    "suppose on the contrary that @xmath14 is of infinite index in @xmath13 and fix an infinite sequence @xmath49 of conjugating automorphisms of @xmath0 representing pairwise distinct cosets of @xmath14 in @xmath13 .",

    "moreover , there is an induced non - trivial isometric @xmath0-action on @xmath57 ( i.e. @xmath0 has no a global fixed point in @xmath61 ) , given by @xmath62 .",
    "we shall show again that this action has a global fixed point .",
    "suppose @xmath10 is an element of @xmath0 acting as a hyperbolic isometry on @xmath61 with translation length @xmath63 , and fix an element @xmath64 on the axis of @xmath10 .",
    "then + @xmath65 and so @xmath66 .      by lemma [ lem : inequalities ] , there are non - negative constants @xmath73 and @xmath74 , depending only on @xmath19 , such that @xmath75 whenever @xmath76 .",

    "we will show first that @xmath10 fixes @xmath108 , and then that @xmath108 is not one of the points at infinity determined by the axis of @xmath10 , contradicting the fact that any hyperbolic isometry of a tree fixes exactly two points at infinity .",

    "let @xmath120 be such that @xmath121 is the projection of @xmath122 on @xmath104 .",
    "then @xmath123 and thus @xmath124 . in the same way",

    "the assumption that @xmath10 acts on @xmath129 as a translation of amplitude @xmath63 implies that either @xmath133 or @xmath134 for all @xmath135 .",

    ". then @xmath136 .",
    "fixing @xmath135 , the geodesic @xmath104 contains the point @xmath137 for each @xmath67 sufficiently large .",
    "thus @xmath138 , and so      so in all cases , every element of the finitely generated group @xmath0 fixes some point of @xmath61 .",

    "it follows from the above proof that @xmath141 for each @xmath142 and each sequence @xmath143 of automorphisms representing pairwise distinct elements in @xmath4 .",
    "the proof of the lemma can be simplified if one at the beginning makes use of the hypothesis that each @xmath144 is a conjugating automorphism .    in the proof of (",
    "* lemma 2.2 ) the points @xmath101 were chosen so that @xmath70 realizes its minimal displacement at @xmath101 .",
    "however , this random choice could give @xmath101 for which the inequality @xmath145 is false .",
    "the correct way to proceed with the proof is to choose @xmath101 as above .",
    "the fact that in the case of hyperbolic groups the action ( on the cayley graph ) is free and cocompact , can be used to avoid case 2 .",

    "thus , by replacing each element by its @xmath147-th power , we can suppose that the translation length of any @xmath70 is big enough .",
    "we consider the short exact sequence ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "since the first term is finite , each torsion - free subgroup of @xmath4 embeds in @xmath15 , which is residually finite by ( * ? ? ?",

    "let @xmath149 be the subgroup of @xmath150 consisting of automorphisms which fix setwise every normal subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , @xmath151 .",
    "after this paper appeared as a preprint , minasyan and osin @xcite proved ( using completely different methods than ours ) that for any relatively hyperbolic group @xmath0 , @xmath14 has finite index in @xmath149 and hence in @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath0 is non - elementary and has no non - trivial finite normal subgroups , then @xmath152 .",
