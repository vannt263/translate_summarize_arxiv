    "supersymmetry is considered to be a compelling extension to the standard model for several reasons .",
    "for example , it stabilizes scalar masses against radiative corrections , allowing theories with fundamental scalars to become natural . for a review see @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry also weighs in on the dark matter problem : stars and other luminous matter contribute a small fraction of the critical density , @xmath4 , while the amount of matter known to exist from its gravitational effects ( both at galaxy and cluster of galaxies scales ) is much larger , @xmath5 ( ref .",
    "furthermore , most of the missing matter seems to be non - baryonic in nature .",
    "the experimental motivation behind the dark matter problem and different search strategies are discussed in more detail in @xcite .    in supersymmetric models , r - parity",
    "is often imposed to avoid weak - scale proton decay or lepton number violation . imposing this symmetry also yields an ideal fermionic dark matter candidate .",
    "namely , in supersymmetric models with r - parity , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and it could conceivably make up a substantial part of the dark matter in the galactic halo .    here",
    "we investigate the direct detection of such a particle .",
    "there have been many such studies in the literature @xcite .",
    "more recently , there have been discussions of numerous variables that can effect direct detection .",
    "these studies include an investigation of the effect of the rotation of the galactic halo @xcite , the effects of the uncertainty of the quark densities within the nuclei @xcite , possible cp violation @xcite , and non - universality of gaugino masses @xcite . here",
    "we attempt to address the following question : is there a minimum cross section for the elastic scattering of neutralinos off of ordinary matter ?",
    "naively , it would seem that a judicious choice of parameters might allow a complete cancellation between different diagrams .",
    "after all , the parameter space is very large in the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and even for a very restrictive framework such as the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , the number of parameters is still quite large .",
    "we will show that there nonetheless exists a minimum cross section in the msugra framework .",
    "however , we will also show that this result strongly depends on the assumptions of the framework , such as unification of different parameters at the gut scale , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and naturalness .",
    "this argument is of great importance when considering the upcoming direct detection experiments .",
    "for the msugra framework , one expects that the future ambitious direct detection experiments can explore most of the parameter space .",
    "however , we find that the detection picture is not quite as rosy for a more general mssm framework .",
    "we adopt the following notation for the superpotential and soft supersymmetry breaking potential in the mssm : @xmath6 here the @xmath7 s are yukawa couplings , the @xmath8 s are trilinear couplings , the @xmath9 are the squark and slepton mass parameters , the @xmath10 are gaugino mass parameters and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are higgs mass parameters .",

    "the neutralino mass matrix reads @xmath19 here @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the physical states are obtained by diagonalizing this matrix .",
    "the lightest neutralino can be written in the form : @xmath24    we are interested in spin independent scattering of neutralinos off of ordinary matter .",
    "this contribution dominates in the case of detectors with large nuclei , such as ge @xcite . as discussed in the literature , in most situations the dominant contribution to",
    "the spin independent amplitude is the exchange of the two neutral higgs bosons , although in some cases the contribution of the squark exchange and loop corrections are substantial .",
    "the relevant tree - level diagrams are shown in figure  [ diagrams ] .",
    "-channel diagram for squark exchange .",
    "there are also diagrams where the neutralino scatters off of gluons in the nucleon through heavy squark loops.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : diagrams ]    we use the darksusy package @xcite in this study .",
    "this code has the following inputs : @xmath10 , @xmath13 , the ratio of the vevs of the two higgs bosons ( @xmath25 ) , the mass of the axial higgs boson ( @xmath26 ) , the soft masses of the sparticles ( @xmath9 ) and the diagonal components of the trilinear coupling matrices ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "all inputs are to be supplied at the weak scale .",
    "darksusy then calculates the particle spectrum , widths and couplings based on the input parameters .",
    "it evaluates the cross section for scattering of neutralinos off protons and neutrons , following ref .",
    "it also evaluates the relic density of the neutralinos for the given input parameters following @xcite , which includes the relativistic boltzmann averaging , sub - threshold and resonant annihilation and coannihilation processes with charginos and neutralinos .",
    "furthermore , darksusy checks for the current constraints obtained by experiments , including the @xmath28 constraint @xcite .",
    "in this section , we briefly outline the msugra framework . in msugra ,",
    "one makes several assumptions :    * there exists a grand unified theory ( gut ) at some high energy scale .",
    "consequently , the gauge couplings unify at the gut scale .",
    "the value of the couplings at the weak scale determines the gut scale to be @xmath29 gev .",
    "the gaugino mass parameters also unify to @xmath30 at the gut scale . *",
    "other unification assumptions are : the scalar mass parameters unify to a value denoted by @xmath31 and the trilinear couplings unify to @xmath32 at the gut scale . using the mssm renormalization group equations ( rges )",
    "we evaluate all parameters at the weak scale . we choose to do this using the one loop rges that can be found , for example , in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "* radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) is imposed : minimization of the one - loop higgs effective potential at the appropriate scale fixes @xmath33 and @xmath26 ( we follow the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) . for completeness , we reproduce the equation for @xmath33 at tree level : @xmath34    with these assumptions , the msugra framework allows four free parameters ( @xmath35 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 and @xmath36 ) . also , the sign of @xmath13 remains undetermined .",
    "starting with these parameters we determine all of the input parameters for the darksusy code .",
    "we allow the free parameters to vary in the intervals @xmath37 the upper bounds on these parameters come from the naturalness assumption : one of the reasons for using supersymmetry is its ability to naturally relate high and low energy scales ; as a result , no parameter in the theory should be very large .",
    "moreover , the upper bound on @xmath30 makes our data set insensitive to the stau - neutralino coannihilations , which are not included in the calculation of relic density performed by darksusy .",
    "we have explicitly checked that there are no models in our data set which would be cosmologically allowed * only * if the stau coannihilations were included .",
    "we will also see later that expanding the upper bound on @xmath30 has serious consequences regarding the lower bound on the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "also , the low value of @xmath36 is set by the requirement that the top yukawa coupling does not blow up before the gut scale is reached .",
    "before we present the detailed analysis of cross section , a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , the @xmath38 constraint eliminates large portions of the @xmath39 parameter space , in agreement with @xcite , @xcite .",
    "second , for both @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we find no higgsino - like lsp models that are cosmologically important , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we plot the variation of the spin independent cross section versus the neutralino mass in figure  [ csvsmchim3 ] .",
    "note that the complete allowed region is split into two parts by the annihilation channel into @xmath42 , which affects the relic density of neutralino .",
    "we consider two relic density constraints .",
    "since the present observations favor the hubble constant @xmath43 and the total matter density @xmath44 , of which baryons contribute @xmath45 , we consider the range @xmath46 .",
    "however , we also examine effects of relaxing the relic density constraint to @xmath47 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath0 ( of the theoretically allowed regions ) comes from the lower bound on the relic density .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath48 comes from the existing constraints from the accelerator experiments .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath48 is a combination of the upper bound on relic density and of the bounds on the free parameters .",

    "so , we can revisit the 5 different cases explored in the previous section .    * case 1 : @xmath174 can not be satisfied because , as in the msugra case , it implies @xmath175 gev , which is ruled out by the relic density cut and the experimental limits ( as shown on figure  [ mssmcsvsmchi ] ) .",
    "the models that get close to satisfying this condition have very low contributions due to the higgs bosons exchange , so this is one of the rare situations where the squark exchange is important . *",
    "case 2 : @xmath176 is now possible to satisfy because @xmath13 and @xmath79 are not related .",
    "we indeed observe that the heavy higgs boson exchange contribution is very small in this case , but since the light higgs boson exchange dominates , @xmath0 is kept relatively high in value .",
    "* case 3 : @xmath111 is also possible to satisfy . as in the msugra case",
    ", the light higgs boson exchange is small and heavy higgs boson exchange dominates . unlike in the msugra case , the accelerator bounds do not rule out these models .",
    "* case 4 : since the naturalness constraint has been relaxed , @xmath13 is allowed to have very large values . then @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 can be driven small , which in turn would make the higgs boson exchange contribution small .",
    "intuitively , large @xmath177 implies that the neutralino is a very pure bino , for which the higgs boson scattering channels vanish .",
    "if the squark masses are kept large as well , the squark contribution will be small too , making the total elastic scattering cross section very small .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ mssmcsvsmu ] - the lowest values of @xmath0 are obtained for the largest values of @xmath177 .",
    "* case 5 : as discussed in the msugra case , if ( @xmath178 ) is negative and sufficiently large , @xmath116 can change sign .",
    "following through eqs .",
    "( [ fhh ] ) and ( [ adeq ] ) , this effect can induce destructive interference between the @xmath72 and @xmath73 terms in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and cause the overall @xmath0 to vanish .",
    "we observed this cancellation in the msugra case for @xmath179 gev , and we also observe it in the general mssm case . in table 1",
    "we present some of the models in which this kind of cancellation takes place .",
    "besides the models at large @xmath48 , we also observe models with relatively low @xmath180 and very low values of @xmath0 ( see rows 3 and 4 of table 1 ) .",
    "these models were not allowed in the msugra framework due to the @xmath181 relationship ( determined by the rge s and the rewsb assumption ) , which does not exist in the general mssm framework .",
    "-proton scattering in the general mssm framework is shown .",
    "a relatively conservative relic density cut is applied , @xmath171 .",
    "note also that the constraint on the gaugino fraction , @xmath172 , is applied .",
    "current accelerator bounds , including @xmath182 are imposed through the darksusy code . ]",
    "[ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in other words , in the general mssm framework it is possible to obtain low values of @xmath0 in several different ways : either by tuning parameters to suppress the contribution of the heavy or the light higgs boson exchange , or by allowing parameters ( such as @xmath13 ) to be very large , which suppreses both the heavy and the light higgs boson exchange channels , or by fine - tunning parameters to achieve a complete cancellation of terms in the eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the lower bound on @xmath0 vanishes and it is beyond reach of the present and the proposed direct detection experiments .",
    "we summarize our results as follows . the main contributions to the cross section for spin independent elastic scattering of neutralinos off",
    "nucleons come from the exchange of the higgs bosons and squarks .",
    "the contribution of the squark exchange is usually much smaller , being of importance only when higgs boson exchange contribution is very small .",
    "we investigate different conditions which could lead to small higgs boson exchange contribution .",
    "we find that in msugra framework , with the free parameter ranges defined in eq .",
    "( [ paramspace ] ) , these conditions are not satisfied due to the relationship between parameters @xmath79 and @xmath13 ( coming from the unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking assumptions ) , the naturalness assumption ( which keeps different parameters from becoming very large ) and the accelerator constraints . we find that the light higgs boson exchange dominates over the other channels and it leads to @xmath183 .",
    "equivalently , this yields an event rate @xmath184 in @xmath185 target , which could be within reach of the future direct detection experiments .",
    "however , if we expand the msugra framework to allow larger neutralino masses , the lower bound on @xmath0 vanishes for those large masses due to the occasional complete cancellation of terms in the eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .    in the more general mssm models ( as defined in and above eq .",
    "( [ mssmparamspace ] ) ) , the situation is significantly different .",
    "the light and/or heavy higgs boson exchange channel can now be suppressed either by tuning parameters to satisfy cases 2 ) or 3 ) , or by allowing the free parameters ( such as @xmath13 ) to be very large . moreover ,",
    "the complete cancellation of terms in the eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is now possible even at low values of @xmath48 because the relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath13 that existed in the msugra framework due to radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , is relaxed in the general mssm framework . as a result ,",
    "the lower bound on @xmath0 is much lower than in the msugra framework and it is beyond reach of the current or proposed direct detection experiments .",
