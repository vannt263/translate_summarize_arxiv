    "it is known that the brownian motion of particles in the presence of asymmetric structures and in non - equilibrium conditions may result in directed motion .",
    "this phenomenon , called brownian motor or brownian ratchet is ubiquitous in the living cells .",
    "the known examples of this phenomenon are the electric potential difference through the ion channels and the movement of the kinesin motor protein along the microtubule @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has attracted great interest in recent years , due to its applications in the separation of particles @xcite and making pumps @xcite and motors @xcite in fine dimensions .",
    "the directed motion of particles arisen by an asymmetric structure as a non - equilibrium phenomenon has been observed in systems covering a broad range of scales such as macroscopic elastic discs @xcite , mesoscopic gears @xcite , microscopic colloidal systems @xcite , moving cells @xcite and ions @xcite .    in the case of polymers , directed translocation of a polymer through a curved bilayer membrane @xcite and polymer passage through a membrane in the presence of chaperons @xcite have been studied .",
    "despite extended studies in this field , the polymer motion through asymmetric structures such as a cone - shaped channel is poorly understood .",
    "it has been shown that cone - shaped channels have important applications in rectifying the ionic currents and in the simulation of biological ion channels @xcite .",
    "polymer translocation through cone - shaped channels has also been studied , in the literature @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the dependencies of the translocation time and the capture rate on the applied voltage and the polymer length are qualitatively similar to those of the cylindrical channels .",
    "the most important point in the case of cone - shaped channels is the very high strength of the electric field in the narrow entry of the channel .",
    "it causes the ionic current through the channel to be affected only by the few monomers in the narrow entry of the channel @xcite .",
    "this point is important in the application of these channels in dna sequencing",
    ". one important challenge of dna sequencing by the ordinary channels such as @xmath0-hemolysin protein channel is the simultaneous effect of 10 - 15 nucleic acids inside the channel on the ionic current @xcite .",
    "however , in the cone - shaped protein channel , mspa , only two nucleic acids which are close to the channel apex simultaneously affect the current @xcite . in dna translocation experiments through mspa , the difference between the effects of the four types of the nucleic acids on the ionic current is larger , compared to the experiments using the cylindrical channels @xcite .",

    "the translocation of a flexible polymer through a cone - shaped channel in the presence of no external driving field is studied , theoretically and by computer simulation . during the translocation process , a force of entropic origin acts on the part of the polymer which is inside the channel .",
    "this force originates from the entropic tendency of the polymer toward the larger entry of the channel .",
    "the translocation time is a decreasing function of this force .",
    "we set out to obtain the effective force , @xmath1 , acting on the polymer as a function of the channel apex angle and the channel length and compare it with the simulation results .",
    "for a given length of the cone - shaped channel , we calculate the effective force for the two cases of small and large apex angles of the channel , theoretically . during the translocation of a polymer through a narrow channel in a wall ( from the cis to the trans side ) , it is known that the monomers of the polymer segment passed to the trans side accumulate near the wall , in front of the channel exit .",
    "therefore , to calculate the effective force acting on a polymer which translocates through a cone - shaped channel of small base diameter ( from the apex to the base ) , we consider the channel as a closed cavity confining a segment of the polymer . in the case of large base diameters , however , we consider one of the polymer ends fixed in the apex of the cone - shaped channel and obtain the confinement free - energy and then the exerted force to the polymer . as a further check of the reliability of the results ,",
    "the force is calculated from two different methods in the case of large diameters of the channel base .    for a given length of the channel",
    ", we find that the effective force is a non - monotonic function of the channel apex angle . combination of the results obtained from the two cases of small and large apex angles shows that the force as a function of the apex angle has a maximum and then a minimum .",
    "we also obtain the dependence of the force on the channel length . for each value of the channel apex angle ,",

    "simulation results ( in the next section ) show that the polymer translocation through a cone - shaped channel is a driven process .",
    "when one end of a polymer is fixed in the channel apex , a driving force is exerted on the polymer , by the channel .",
    "this force results from the increase in the polymer entropy with moving to the wider parts of the channel . during the polymer translocation ,",
    "also , the very narrow apex of the channel divides the polymer into separate parts with separate free energies .",
    "the free energy of the polymer part inside the channel decreases with the polymer movement toward the wide entry of the channel . indeed ,",
    "the system is in nonequilibrium and writing a total free energy for the polymer is meaningless .",
    "hence , in this section , we consider the part of the polymer which is inside the channel as a separate polymer in a conical channel and calculate its free energy .",

    "it has already been shown that during the polymer translocation through a narrow channel , the monomers of the polymer segment passed to the opposite side crowd close to the channel @xcite . accordingly , for the case of small apex angles of the channel , we assume that the channel is a closed volume containing a part of the polymer . with this assumption , we calculate the force acting on the polymer due to the asymmetric shape of the channel . in the case of large apex angles , we calculate the force acting on a polymer whose end is fixed in the apex of a cone - shaped channel and calculate the driving force on the polymer , using two different methods . by combining the results of the two cases",
    ", we conclude the qualitative behavior of the force acting on the polymer as a function of the channel apex angle .",
    "consider a flexible polymer , consisting of @xmath4 spherical monomers of diameter @xmath5 , which is confined inside a frustum ( see the inset of fig .",

    "the confinement free energy of a polymer inside a closed space of volume @xmath6 is known to be @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the flory exponent @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the volume of the confining space is equal to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the free energy of confinement can be written as    @xmath10    here , @xmath0 is half of the apex angle of the channel , and @xmath11 is the distance between the region in which the polymer is confined and a cross section of the cone with diameter @xmath12 .",

    "in other words , if one removes the two confining walls , which are perpendicular to the channel axis , the polymer moves to the wider part of the channel to gain more entropy .",
    "this is the origin of the force exerted to the segment of a polymer inside the channel , in the course of its translocation through a cone - shaped channel . to obtain the driving force in the polymer translocation through a cone - shaped channel of length @xmath13 and tip diameter @xmath12",

    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ closed - force](a ) , the force as a function of the apex angle has a maximum at small values of @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of this maximum can be explained regarding the two determining factors in the force : the strength of the polymer confinement in the channel and the magnitude of the asymmetry in the channel shape . at small apex angles ,",
    "the channel volume is small and the strength of the confinement is high . by increasing the apex angle and hence the asymmetry of the channel shape , the force of entropic origin exerted to the polymer increases . by more increasing the apex angle",
    ", the confinement effect of the channel on the polymer weakens and the strength of the force decreases .",
