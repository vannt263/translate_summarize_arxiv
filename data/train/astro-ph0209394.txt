    "strong dynamical evidence now exists for 17 black holes ( bhs ) in x - ray novae but only a few have been observed away from the galactic plane ( white & van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath0 is a high galactic latitude ( @xmath1 ) bh x - ray nova having an exceptionally large mass function @xmath2 and the shortest orbital period ( @xmath3=4.08 h ) among the bh binaries .",
    "the donor star is probably a main sequence star of @xmath4 .",
    "the transverse motion on the plane of the sky indicates that the system is now orbiting with a space velocity of @xmath5 relative to the local standard of rest ( mirabel et al 2001 ) , much higher than the velocity dispersion of the galactic bh x - ray binaries ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "* disk - a : * an asymmetric natal kick as large ( @xmath7 km / s ) as never recorded in the case of a black hole . given the scaling @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( colpi & wasserman 2002 ) , such kick is compatible with the high velocity end of the observed distribution of the transverse velocities of the pulsars ( arzoumanian , chernoff & cordes 2002 ) .    * disk - b : * a symmetric kick from recoil due to supernova explosion ( typically of order @xmath10 km / s ) , superimposed to the contribution of the circular velocity ( @xmath11 km / s ) of the galactic disk at the site of the supernova explosion .",
    "* gc - a : * a three - body exchange interaction ( where a single bh intrudes into a main - sequence star binary , ms+ms , replacing the less massive star , ms ) occurred in the cluster core in the first stages of its evolution .",
    "however , given the recoil energy of @xmath12 needed to eject the bh+ms binary from a gc of typical escape speed 30 - 50 @xmath13 the initial ms+ms binary should have been extremely tight ( at most @xmath14 ) for accomplishing both momentum and energetic requirements . as a consequence ,",
    "the rate for this interaction is extremely small , having a time - scale @xmath15 yr ( for a stellar density @xmath16 and a bh fraction of @xmath17 ) .",
    "furthermore , such a close approach between the bh and the other bodies can trigger tidal effects and mass loss in any of the main sequence stars leading to angular momentum losses and hence lower recoil velocities for the ms+bh binary .",
    "* gc - b : * a kick imparted to the binary at the moment of the bh formation due to the recoil from the sn explosion .",
    "the recoil velocity required for escaping the gc potential well ( @xmath18 ) is compatible with the velocity dispersion observed in the sample of the bh x - ray binaries in the galactic field and can be achieved with the ejection of only @xmath19 , which in turn allows to avoid the disruption of the massive ( @xmath20 ) pre - sn binary system .    the morphological similarity between the galactic orbit of @xmath0 and that of some gcs suggested ( mirabel et al . 2001 ) the fascinating opportunity of identifying the parent cluster of @xmath0 using purely kinematic considerations , namely the coincidence in the 6-dimensional phase space ( of velocities and positions ) at a given time .",
    "unfortunately , we have verified that the current uncertainties in the observed velocity vector of the gcs ( having errors as large as @xmath21 , dinescu et al .",
    "1999 ) hamper any reliable identification if the ejection has occurred ( like in the cases * gc - a * and * gc - b * ) earlier than the last @xmath22 2 - 3 gyr .",
