    "this paper tells the story of equivariance , under a compact lie group , in the higher algebra surrounding _ topological quantum field theory _ ( tqft ) . speaking in riddles ,",
    "if @xmath0-dimensional tqft is a higher analogue of cohomology ( the reader may think of the fukaya - floer theory of a symplectic manifold as refining ordinary cohomology ) , my story of gauged tqfts is the analogue of equivariant cohomology .",
    "the case of finite groups , well - studied in the literature @xcite , provides a useful and easy reference point , but the surprising features of the continuous case , such as the appearance of holomorphic symplectic spaces and langlands duality , are missing there .    from another angle , this is a story of the categorified representation theory of a compact lie group @xmath2 , with the provision that representations are _ topological _ : the @xmath2-action ( on a linear category ) factors through the topology of @xmath2 .",
    "one floor below , where the group acts on vector spaces , these would be not the ordinary complex representations of @xmath2 , but the local systems of vector spaces on the classifying space @xmath3 .",
    "there is no distinction for a finite group , but in the connected case , @xmath3 is simply connected , and we must pass to the derived category to see anything interesting",
    ". the same will hold in the categorified story , where simply connected groups will appear to have trivial representation theory , before deriving .",
    "this observation suggests a straightforward homological algebra approach to the investigation , worthy of featuring as an example in a graduate textbook . pursuing that road",
    ", however , leads to faulty predictions , even in the simplest case of pure gauge theory of a point ( topological yang - mills theory ) .",
    "one reason for this failure is a curious predilection of interesting tqfts to break the obvious @xmath4-grading information present , collapsing it to a @xmath5 grading , or encoding it in more labored form ( as in the euler field of gromov - witten theory @xcite ) .",
    "the result is that homological algebra , which localizes the spectrum of a graded ring to its degree zero part , loses relevant information , which needs restoration by ulterior guesswork . in our example",
    ", we will see the homological information in the neighborhood of a lagrangian within a certain holomorphic symplectic manifold , whereas most of the interesting ` physics ' happens elsewhere .",
    "the emerging geometric picture for this categorical topological representation theory is surprisingly attractive .",
    "representations admit a character theory , but characters are now coherent sheaves on a manifold related to the conjugacy classes , instead of functions .",
    "the manifold in question , the _ bfm space _ of the langlands dual lie group @xmath6 , introduced in @xcite , is closely related to the cotangent bundle to the space of conjugacy classes in the complex group @xmath7 .",
    "( for @xmath8 , it is the atiyah - hitchin manifold studied in detail in @xcite . )",
    "multiplicity spaces of @xmath2-invariant maps between linear representations are now replaced by multiplicity categories , whose ` dimensions ' are the @xmath9-spaces in the category of coherent sheaves .",
    "( in interesting examples , they are the frobenius algebras underlying @xmath0-dimensional tqfts . )",
    "there is a preferred family of simple representations , which in a sense exhausts the space of representations : they foliate the @xmath10 space .",
    "every such representation is ` symplectically induced ' from a one - dimensional representation of a certain levi subgroup of @xmath2 : more precisely , it is the fukaya category of a flag variety of @xmath2 .",
    "this is formally similar to the borel - weil construction of irreducible representations of @xmath2 by holomorphic induction .",
    "recall that in that world there is another kind of  @xmath11-induction \" from closed subgroups , which is right adjoint to the restriction functor .",
    "the counterpart of nave induction also exists in our world , and gives the ( curved ) _ string topologies _",
    "@xcite of the same flag varieties , instead of their fukaya categories .",
    "this story might seem a bit unhinged , were it not for the appearance of the governing structure in the work of kapustin , rozansky and saulina @xcite .",
    "studied there are boundary conditions in the @xmath12-dimensional tqft associated to a holomorphic symplectic manifold @xmath13 , known as rozansky - witten theory @xcite . among those are holomorphic lagrangian sub - manifolds of @xmath13 , or more generally , sheaves of categories over such sub - manifolds .",
    "( the full @xmath0-category of all boundary conditions does not yet have a precise definition . ) the relation to gauge theory is summarized by the observation that gaugeable @xmath0-dimensional field theories are topological boundary conditions for pure @xmath12-dimensional topological gauge theory .",
    "the reader may illustrate this with an easy example : the representations of a finite group @xmath14 are the boundary conditions for pure @xmath14-gauge theory in @xmath0 dimensions ; yet these representations are exactly the @xmath15-dimensional topological field theories ( vector spaces ) which admit @xmath14-symmetry .",
    "modulo the @xcite description of rozansky - witten theory , my entire story is underpinned by the following    pure topological gauge theory in @xmath12 dimensions for a compact lie group @xmath2 is equivalent to the rozansky - witten theory for the bfm space of the langlands dual lie group @xmath6 .",
    "i shall offer no elucidation of this , beyond its inspirational value ; however , strong indications of this statement have been known in the physics literature , at least for special @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "formulating this statement in a mathematically useable way will require an excursion through much preliminary material in  2 - 5 .",
    "a small reward will come in  6 , where we illustrate how these ideas can lead to ` real answers ' .",
    "a closing warning is that the results in this paper are partly experimental : enough examples have been checked to rule out plausible alternatives , but i do not claim to know proofs in full generality .",
    "in fact , the status of floer - fukaya theory makes such claims difficult to sustain , and the author has no special expertise on that topic .",
    "in topological cases , such as for string topology ( fukaya theory of cotangent bundles ) , precise statements and proofs are possible ( and easy ) .",
    "more generally , the results apply to the abstract setting of differential graded ( or @xmath16-categories ) with topological @xmath2-action , the question being to what extent the fukaya category of a symplectic manifold with hamiltonian @xmath2-action qualifies .",
    "( for non - compact manifolds , this depends on the ` wrapping ' condition at @xmath17 . ) if nothing else , the paper can be read as a template for what a nice world should look like .",
    "i thank m.  abouzaid , d.  ben - zvi , k.  fukaya , k.  hori , a.  kapustin , a.  neitzke , c.  woodward for helpful comments and conversation , and am especially indebted to e.  witten for explaining the relation to @xmath18-dimensional gauge theory and the nahm equations .",
    "many thanks are due to the geometry group at ut austin for the invitation to lecture there , where a primitive version of this material was first outlined @xcite ; for later developments , see @xcite .",
    "topological field theory , introduced originally by atiyah@xcite , segal @xcite and witten @xcite , promised to systematize a slew of new @xmath12-manifold invariants .",
    "the invariants of a @xmath12-manifold @xmath19 are thought to arise from _ path integrals _ over a space of maps from @xmath19 to a target @xmath13 .",
    "the latter is often a manifold , but in interesting cases , related to _",
    "gauge theory _ , it is a stack .",
    "one example relevant for us will have @xmath13 a holomorphic symplectic manifold , leading to _ rozansky - witten theory _ @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional version of this notion quickly found application to the counting of holomorphic curves , the gromov - witten invariants of a symplectic manifold @xmath13 : these are controlled by a family of tqfts parametrized by the even cohomology space @xmath20 .      both theories above have a bearing on my story , once they are _ extended down to points_. in the original definition , a @xmath21-dimensional tqft is a symmetric , strongly monoidal functor form the category whose objects are closed @xmath22-manifolds and whose morphisms are compact @xmath21-bordisms , to the category @xmath23 of complex finite - dimensional vector spaces ; the monoidal structures are disjoint union and tensor product , respectively .",
    "( some tangential structure on manifolds is chosen , as part of the starting datum . ) fully extending the theory means extending this functor to one from the _ bordism @xmath21-category _ @xmath24 , whose objects are points and whose @xmath25-morphisms are compact @xmath25-manifolds with corners ( and some tangential structure ) , to some de - looping of the category of vector spaces : a symmetric monoidal @xmath21-category whose top three layers are complex numbers , vector spaces and linear categories , or a differential graded ( dg ) version of this",
    ". when @xmath26 , which most concerns us , the target is usually the @xmath0-category @xmath27 of linear dg categories , linear functors and natural transformations .",
    "the reader may consult lurie @xcite , references therein and the wide following it inspired , for a precise setting of higher categories .",
    "this theory is defined for unoriented manifolds ; among others , the functor @xmath28 which sends a point @xmath29 to the category @xmath30 of ( finite - dimensional ) linear representations of @xmath14 , the half - circle bordism @xmath31 to the functor @xmath32 sending @xmath33 to the ( @xmath0-sided ) regular representation of @xmath14 , the opposite bordism @xmath34 to the functor @xmath35 sending @xmath36 to the subspace of @xmath14-invariants therein .",
    "a closed surface gives a number , which is the ( weighted ) count of principal @xmath14-bundles .",
    "see for instance @xcite for a uniform construction of the complete functor and generalizations .",
    "the first theorem of @xcite is that an such extended tqft @xmath37 is determined by its value @xmath38 on the point , at least in the setting of _ framed _ manifolds .",
    "the object @xmath38 , which we call the generator of @xmath39 , must satisfy some strong ( _ full dualizability _ ) conditions , but carries no additional structure , beyond being a member of an ambient @xmath21-category .    on the other hand , the ability to pass to surfaces with less structure than a framing on their tangent bundle forces additional structure on the generator @xmath38 .",
    "the point ( conceived together with an ambient germ of surface ) carries a @xmath0-framing , on which the group @xmath40 acts .",
    "lurie s second theorem states that , given a tangential structure , encoded in a homomorphism @xmath41 , factoring the theory @xmath39 from @xmath24 through the category @xmath42 of @xmath21-folds with @xmath2-structure is equivalent to exhibiting @xmath38 as a fixed - point for the @xmath2-action on the image of tqfts in the target@xmath21- category ( more precisely , the sub - groupoid of fully dualizable objects and invertible morphisms ) .",
    "the best - known case of oriented surfaces , when @xmath43 , requires a _ calabi - yau _ structure on @xmath38 .",
    "this can be variously phrased : as a trivialization of the _ serre functor _ , which is an automorphism of any fully dualizable linear dg category ( see remark  [ serre ] below ) ; alternatively , as a linear functional on the cyclic homology of @xmath38 whose restriction to hochschild homology @xmath44 induces a perfect pairing on @xmath9 spaces : @xmath45 this case of lurie s theorem recovers earlier results of costello , kontsevich and hopkins - lurie @xcite .    the hochschild homology @xmath44 is meaningful in a different guise : it is the space of states @xmath46 of the theory , for the circle with the radial framing . the circle is pictured here with a germ of surrounding surface , and therefore carries a @xmath4 s worth of framings , detected by a winding number .",
    "the hochschild cohomology @xmath47 goes with the blackboard framing , and the space for the framing with winding number @xmath48 is @xmath47 of the @xmath48th power of the serre functor .",
    "( of course , for oriented theories there is no framing dependence , and these spaces agree . )",
    "an important point is that the action of @xmath49 ( and thus @xmath2 ) on the target category @xmath38 is _ topological _ , or factored through its topology .",
    "there are several ways to formulate this constraint , which is vacuous when @xmath2 is discrete .",
    "the favored formulation will depend on the nature of the target category ; in the linear case , and when @xmath2 is connected , we will provisionally settle for the one in theorem  [ e2action ] below .",
    "combined with statement  [ omegag ] below , this generalizes an old result of seidel  @xcite on hamiltonian diffeomorphism groups .    here",
    "are some alternative definitions :    1 .",
    "we can ask for a _ local trivialization _ of the action in a contractible neighborhood of @xmath50 , an isomorphism with the trivial action of that same neighborhood ( up to coherent homotopies of all orders ) .",
    "2 .   using the action to form a bundle of categories with fiber @xmath38 over the classifying stack @xmath3",
    ", we ask for an integrable flat connection on the resulting bundle of categories .",

    ", we can ask for a trivialization of the lifted @xmath51-action . + now , the action of the based loop group @xmath52 ( kernel of @xmath53 ) is already trivial ( being factored through @xmath50 ) , and the difference of trivializations defines a ( topological ) representation of @xmath52 by automorphisms of the identity functor in @xmath38 .",
    "+ the group @xmath52 has an @xmath54 structure , seen from its equivalence with the second loop space @xmath55 ; and the representation on @xmath56 is the @xmath0-holonomy , over spheres , of the flat connection in # 2 .",
    "importantly , it is an @xmath54 representation .    when @xmath2 is connected , description # 3 above captures all the information for the action ( up to contractible choices ) , because the space of trivializations of a trivial topological action of @xmath51 is contractible .    [ serre ] a topological action of the circle on a category is given by a group homomorphism from @xmath57 to the automorphisms of the identity : equivalently , a central ( in the category ) automorphism of each object .",
    "because there is no higher topology in @xmath58 , this also works when the target is a @xmath0-category , such as the ( sub - groupoid of fully dualizable objects in the ) @xmath0-category @xmath27 , the structural @xmath59 action gives an automorphism of each category : this is the serre functor .",

    "( of course , we may add any desired tangential structure , such as orientability , by switching to @xmath84 , by projection . ) making @xmath38 into a fixed point for the trivial @xmath2-action means defining a ( topological ) @xmath2-action on @xmath38 .",
    "this is the input datum for a classically gauged theory .",
    "quantizing the gauge theory , or integrating over principal @xmath2-bundles , is tricky .",
    "it is straightforward for finite groups : integration of numbers is a weighted sum , and integration of vector spaces and categories is a finite limit or colimit .",
    "( the duality constraints require the limits and colimts to agree ; working in characteristic @xmath85 ensures that @xcite . ) for lie groups @xmath2 , integration of the numbers requires a fundamental class on the moduli of principal bundles .",
    "for instance , the symplectic volume form is relevant to topological yang - mills theory .",
    "a limited @xmath86-theoretic fundamental class was defined in @xcite , and cohomological classes , such as the one relevant to topological yang - mills theory , can be extracted from it . but this matter seems worthy of more subtle discussion than space allows here .",
    "in fact , the gauge theory _ can not _ always be fully quantized .",
    "the generating object for the quantum gauge theory is the invariant category @xmath87 , which agrees with the co - invariant category @xmath88 under mild assumptions . in the framework of theorem  [ e2action ]",
    ", we compute the generator @xmath88 as a tensor product @xmath89 with the trivial representation .",
    "the @xmath15-dimensional part of the field theory , and sometimes part of the surface operations , are well - defined ; but the complete surface - level operations often fail to be defined .",
    "thus , for the trivial @xmath90 theory , @xmath91 with trivial @xmath2-action , and the fixed - points are local systems over @xmath3 .",

    "locally where this identification is valid , @xmath116 becomes equivalent to the _ matrix factorization _",

    "( see for instance @xcite . )",
    "several insights emerge from this important notion .    1",
    ".   a familiar actor in mirror symmetry , a complex manifold @xmath111 with potential @xmath124 , is really the object in @xmath125 represented by the graph @xmath126 , masquerading as a more traditional geometric object .",
    "the matrix factorization category @xmath127 is its @xmath9 with the zero - section .",
    "this resolves the contradiction in which the restriction of the category @xmath127 to a sub - manifold @xmath128 is commonly taken to be the matrix factorization category of @xmath129 .",
    "that is clearly false in the @xmath0-category of @xmath114-module categories ( the result of localizing to the zero - section @xmath130 ) .",
    "for instance , if the critical locus of @xmath124 does not meet @xmath19 , @xmath9 computed in @xmath114-modules gives zero . instead , @xmath19 must be replaced by the object represented by its co - normal bundle in @xmath125 , whose @xmath9 there with @xmath126 computes precisely @xmath131 .",
    "2 .   the well - defined assignment sends @xmath114-module categories to sheaves of categories with lagrangian support in the cotangent bundle @xmath132 , completed at the zero - section .",
    "namely , the hochschild cohomology of such a category @xmath133 is ( locally on @xmath111 ) an @xmath54-algebra over the second ( @xmath54 ) hochschild cohomology of @xmath114 , which is an @xmath134 algebra .",
    "the spectrum of the latter is @xmath132 , with @xmath134 structure given by the standard symplectic form .",
