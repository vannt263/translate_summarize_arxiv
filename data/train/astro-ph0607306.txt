    "the contribution of star - forming galaxies at @xmath17 to the uv ionizing background , and hence the reionisation of the universe , is still debated .",
    "bunker et al .",

    "@xmath3-drops in the hudf ( see stanway & bunker 2004 for a comparison ) , but suggested that unobserved galaxies below the detection limit could contribute much of the flux if the faint - end slope of the rest - uv luminosity function was much steeper than @xmath24 seen for lyman break galaxies at lower redshifts ( @xmath25 ; steidel et al .",
    "stiavelli , fall & panagia ( 2004 ) suggested that a warmer intergalactic medium ( igm ) , a top - heavy imf and substantially lower metallicity ( e.g. , population iii ) at @xmath0 might just provide sufficient ionizing flux if the escape fraction was @xmath26 , much higher than observed at @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ; inoue , iwata & deharveng 2006 ) . whilst the slumping star formation rate density from the observed @xmath3-drops ( bunker et al .",
    "2004 , bouwens et al .",
    "2004a ) might be insufficient to account for reionisation at @xmath0 , it is possible that earlier more intense star formation played a significant role in achieving reionisation at higher redshifts .    using public imaging taken as part of the `` great observatories",

    "potential reasons for this include a high contribution from low - luminosity sources , dust obscuration and/or a yet to be observed phase of star formation at very high redshift ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "recently , yan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have provided an estimate to the stellar mass density at @xmath0 , and concluded that the bulk of reionising photons must have been provided by other sources , perhaps by objects that are below current detection limits .",
    "it should be noted that such studies of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) place _ lower _ limits on the stellar mass density at the epoch of observation .",
    "the lbg selection technique is reliant upon an objects detection in the rest - frame uv ( e.g. , the @xmath32-band for @xmath3-drops at @xmath0 ) , so there must be at least _ some _ ongoing star formation at the epoch of observation for the galaxy to be selected . attempts to find post - starburst ( balmer - break ) objects at @xmath0 are extremely difficult and uncertain due to a large population of lower redshift interloping galaxies .",
    "for example , mobasher et al .  (",

    "we restrict ourselves to the @xmath3-drop selection , which has proven to be a reliable technique in isolating @xmath39 star - forming galaxies ( see bunker et al .",

    "the work presented in this paper is an independent analysis of the @xmath3-drop population , and differs from the recent work of yan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in several ways .",
    "in addition to photometric data gathered in _ hst_/acs & _ spitzer_/irac wavebands , we also use ground - based near - ir imaging of the goods - south field to better constrain the seds and the stellar population fitting ( see sections  [ sec : phot]&[sec : seds ] ) . rather than assign a common redshift of @xmath40 to all galaxies in our sample , we choose to use @xmath3-drops with either spectroscopically confirmed or robust photometric redshifts , and provide photometry for each source and details of the best - fit stellar population models for individual galaxies ( sections  [ sec : reduct]&[sec : analysis ] ) .",

    "2005 ; schaerer & pello 2005 ) , and also of a @xmath161 grb host galaxy ( berger et al . 2006 ) suggest that these objects suffer from measurable dust extinction ( @xmath162 mag ) .",
    "if @xmath0 objects are generally found to be dusty , then their star formation rates , and hence the global star formation density , will have been underestimated . to investigate this , we re - ran our sed fitting routine whilst incorporating the calzetti ( 1997 ) dust reddening law , appropriate for starburst galaxies .",
    "for each of the b&c spectral template age steps , we varied the reddening over the range @xmath163 mag , in steps of @xmath164 mag , and computed the reduced @xmath143 at each step . inspecting the results presented in table  [ tab : multidusttable ] , we find little or no evidence for intrinsic dust reddening in our selection of @xmath3-drop galaxies , over the wavelength range studied ( out to @xmath165 m ) , with object @xmath95 displaying the highest e(b - v ) value of @xmath166 , and several other sources having formal best fits with no reddening .",

    "we were also able to use data at 5.8@xmath9 m and 8.0@xmath9 m to constrain the average reddening in our sample .",
    "cutouts of six brightest 3.6@xmath9 m galaxies ( all objects with @xmath168mag , excluding the t - dwarf ) were taken from the irac images in all four channels .",

    "larger apertures of @xmath169 and @xmath170 pixel diameter were used at 5.8@xmath9 m and 8.0@xmath9 m to allow for the larger psf ( see eyles et al .",

    "a detection is present at @xmath171 , whilst at 8.0@xmath9 m we fail to detect the galaxies but are able to obtain a useful limit .",
    "this composite sed allows us to rule out reddening of @xmath172 , assuming a solar metallicity and an sed typical of our irac detections ( see figure  [ fig : ch34limits ] ) .",
    "in fact , our composite is somewhat bluer than the solar metallicity seds at rest - frame wavelengths of 0.5 - 1.0 @xmath9 m , and favours a low metallicity ( @xmath173 solar ) , though solar metallicity can not be ruled out on the basis of these data .",
    "all of the results quoted in this work were produced via the fitting of b&c spectral synthesis models to our photometry using a salpeter ( 1955 ) power law imf . to test the effects of differing imf models on the derived properties of our @xmath3-drops , for the limiting cases of an instantaneous ( ssp ) burst model and that of a continuous sfr we also employed a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf .",
    "we find that for a chabrier imf , the returned ages of our objects were very similar , but that the stellar masses were @xmath174 less than those produced using a salpeter imf .",

    "it is possible that some of our photometric datapoints may be contaminated due to the presence of strong spectral lines .",
    "we can not definitively remove any contribution by such lines from the measured fluxes without spectroscopy of these emission lines ; the most prominent of these would lie at @xmath175 m , where sufficiently deep spectroscopy is not currently viable , but could be done with nirspec on the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst)_. for the moment , we use our estimates of the current star formation rates in each individual @xmath0 galaxy to assess the possible impact of line contamination on our measurement of the spectral energy distributions , and on the fitting of the stellar ages and masses .",

    "we then remove this line contribution to the irac channel 2 filter and recompute the magnitude . in all cases ,",
    "the effect was a dimming of @xmath181mag ( at most a 10% effect ) .",
    "this is consistent with the range in h@xmath73 rest - frame equivalent widths of @xmath182  at @xmath183 reported by erb et al .",
    "we also consider the effect of dust causing the star formation rate to be underestimated from the rest - uv by a factor of @xmath184 relative to h@xmath73 ( see erb et al .",
    "2005 ) , which would cause at most an overestimate of @xmath185mag in the channel 2 photometry ( comparable to the typical error on the detection ) .",
    "we have re - run the stellar population fitting to the ` line - free ' seds , and get similar results ( within the @xmath186 confidence intervals ) for the stellar ages and stellar masses ; this is largely because our constraint on the break amplitude comes mainly from the irac channel 1 , which is much less affected by line contamination that channel 2 .",

    "the remaining seven irac - undetected objects are consistent with having young ages and low stellar masses . as discussed in section  [ sec : galfit ] , the remaining 14 of the 31 objects were discarded due to the severity of confusion in the irac imaging ; attempts to remove the neighbouring sources using galfit proved unsuccessful , and hence reliable photometry was unobtainable .",
    "however , inspection of the @xmath32-band magnitudes and also the ( @xmath188 ) colours ( table  [ tab : coords ] ) using small apertures for the _ hst_/acs suggests that the _ spitzer_-confused galaxies , and the galaxies without goods - music photometric redshifts , have the same distribution of @xmath32-magnitudes and colours as those 16 galaxies which were isolated or had neighbouring sources successfully subtracted .",
    "hence we are able to compensate for the loss of these objects from our sample , by making the reasonable assumption that the stellar mass distribution of the @xmath3-drop population is independent of irac contamination ( i.e. , we assume that the occurrence of a foreground confusing source in the irac image is random and not related to the intrinsic properties of the @xmath0 @xmath3-drop ) .",

    "we note that although our selection of objects reside at different redshifts , for the sake of simplicity we assume a fixed redshift ( @xmath108 ) so that only a single luminosity cut is used ( using an `` effective volume '' accounts for the effect of different redshifts and hence luminosities for a fixed limiting magnitude ) . from this , we estimate the scaling factor to be @xmath205 ( for the steidel and bouwens values of @xmath206 ) , resulting in a possible total ( corrected ) stellar mass of @xmath207 .",

    "therefore , correcting the observed mass function of these objects for those which are below our selection limit is likely to be highly inaccurate , as the relation between the mass function and the rest - uv luminosity function is non - trivial .",

    "( 2006 )  the shortfall of these model scenarios is even greater .",
    "different choices in the imf slope and metallicity may narrow the predicted versus observed stellar mass density .",
    "however , with the conservative lower limits expressed here and in other studies , most corrections ( such as reddening , surface brightness effects , and limiting magnitude ) tend to actually _ increase _ the mass .      the fitting of the b&c spectral synthesis models to our photometric data has allowed us to gain estimates of the current sfrs for our selected @xmath3-drop galaxies . for our six sources which show evidence of significant balmer/4000  breaks , we find the inferred sfrs span a substantial range , @xmath229 , involving between @xmath230 of their total stellar mass ( derived from the two - population composite model fits generally favoured for these objects ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath93 & @xmath94 have , for their two population sed fits , inferred sfrs of @xmath231 & @xmath232 .",
    "@xmath93 ( sbm03#1 ) is the brightest confirmed @xmath3-drop in the udf , with @xmath233 mag , and @xmath94 ( sbm03#3 ) is the brightest @xmath3-drop in the goods - south field , with @xmath234 mag ; these two objects were the focus of our previous study .",
    "their estimated sfrs are by far the highest of our six balmer/4000  break @xmath0 sources ; the fainter four have inferred current sfrs between @xmath235 .",
    "the remaining three irac - detected objects have inferred ongoing sfrs of @xmath236 .",
    "in fact , two of these sources nominally have sfrs of @xmath237 inferred by their seds , as the preferred models for each of these are of young systems being viewed shortly after a single starburst ( i.e. no _ current _ star formation , but rather very recent activity , within 10myr so the rest - uv continuum still persists ) .    in eyles",
    "( 2005 ) we commented that sbm03#1 & sbm03#3 may not be typical of the entire @xmath3-drop population ; our analysis here suggests that in fact a substantial proportion of @xmath3-drops share similar masses and ages .",
    "however , they are significantly different from the subset of our selected objects which are undetected at irac wavelengths , and which appear to be much younger and less massive ( see section  [ sec : nondetections ] ) .",
    "hence these two objects are actually quite representative of the older , more massive @xmath3-drop population , but in terms of current star formation rates , they do stand out alone as the most currently active of @xmath3-drop galaxies in the goods - south field .",
    "consideration of the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ; e.g. , brinchmann & ellis 2000 ) is useful when investigating the sfrs of our @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "it is defined as specific @xmath238 , and is a measure of the fraction of the total stellar mass that is currently being born as stars .",
    "the ssfr is similar in concept to the dimensionless ` @xmath239-parameter ' ( e.g. , brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is the ratio of the current star formation rate to the past average .",
    "the specific sfrs calculated from the results of the sed fitting are tabulated in tables[tab : multigaltable],[tab : multidusttable]&[tab : multitwopoptable ] . for the best - fit models to our irac - detected sources , we calculate values of specific @xmath240 ( figure  [ fig : bparam ] ) , extending up to @xmath241 for the composite sed of the irac - undetected galaxies . these are comparable to the values inferred by egami et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for a @xmath242 lensed galaxy ( kneib et al .",
    "2004 ) , and are also consistent with the findings of yan et al .",
    "these specific sfr values are an indication of vigorous star formation occurring in these nine irac - detected objects at the time of observation , and these specific star formation rates are typically higher than the lower - redshift results of sajina et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and gil de paz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . however , we find that in most cases , the past - average sfr must be comparable , if not greater than the current sfr .",
    "this is the reason why the star formation histories that , for most of these objects , return the best - fit results are decaying sfr models ; the exponential ( tau ) models , and for the younger galaxies , the burst ( ssp ) models .",
    "if this was not the case , then there would not have been enough time , prior to the epoch of observation , for the stellar masses of these objects to assemble , considering their inferred formation redshifts .",
    "assuming the limiting case of a constant sfr , most of our nine irac - detected objects require past average sfrs of the order of sfr@xmath243 , with some needing sfrs perhaps as high as @xmath244 . the relative lack of @xmath242 candidate galaxies and the resultant continuing low luminosity density seen by bouwens et al .",

    "hst_/nicmos udf suggests that reionisation may have been achieved by a considerably higher sfr density at even earlier epochs ( although see bouwens et al .",
    "2005 ) , and our analysis here supports this .    taking a different approach towards exploring the previous star formation rates of our @xmath3-drop sample , rather than assuming constant sfrs prior to observation , we take into account the best - fit star formation histories of each of our galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfh ] is a composite plot of the best - fit sfh ( solid lines ) for our nine irac - detected objects .",
    "the dashed line represents represents the total sfr contribution due to these objects , smoothed using a time interval of 100myr , from the time of formation ( obtained from their inferred ages ) until the epoch of observation ( i.e. the redshift at which they now reside ) .",
    "the estimated star formation rate densities extrapolated over each epoch shown in figure  [ fig : sfh ] represent lower limits to the _ actual _ sfrd due to the populations of galaxies not accounted for in our @xmath0 galaxy selection ( see section  [ sec : massdensity ] ) . however , our results seem to suggest that the star formation density increases at @xmath12 , relative to our measured value at @xmath0 .      from sed fitting to",

    "[ sec : sfh ] we summed these to recover the star formation rate at @xmath90 , necessarily a lower limit on this quantity as our galaxy census in incomplete ( magnitude - limited on the rest - frame uv ) .",
    "however , our results do suggest a vigorous phase of star formation activity , prior to @xmath0 .",
    "if the resultant ionizing photons are able reach the igm ( i.e.  if the escape fraction is high ) then this star formation may have played a key role in the reionisation of the universe .",
    "madau , haardt & rees ( 1999 ) estimate the density of star formation required for reionisation , and we use their equation 27 ( updated for a more recent concordance cosmology estimate of the baryon density from spergel et al .",

    "simulations suggest @xmath249 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath250 ) for high - redshift galaxies is highly uncertain ( e.g. , steidel , pettini & adelberger 2001 ) , but we consider here the limiting case of a high escape fraction @xmath251 ( i.e. , no absorption by h  i / dust ) .",
    "it has recently been suggested by stiavelli , fall & panagia ( 2004 ) that this star formation rate density requirement for reionisation could be relaxed by a factor of @xmath193 at @xmath0 since the igm temperature will be higher ( perhaps 20,000k rather than the 10,000k assumed in madau , haardt & rees 1999 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : reion ] shows this star formation rate requirement for reionisation ( solid curve , for a 20,000k igm ) overplotted with the star formation rate at @xmath90 inferred from the population synthesis fits to the @xmath3-drops and corrected for incompleteness ( confused galaxies and those below our magnitude limit ; see section  [ sec : sfh ] ) .",
    "this past star formation rate should still be regarded as a lower limit , as dormant post - starburst galaxies are not found by the lyman break technique .",
    "the incompleteness is likely to be larger at higher redshifts ( earlier times ) since by a redshift of 6 the light from these fading populations will be swamped by any more recent star formation activity in these galaxies .",
    "what is apparent from figure  [ fig : reion ] is that our inferred lower limit on the past star formation activity at @xmath252 is sufficient to achieve reionisation , provided that the escape fraction is high .",
    "the star formation history at higher redshift is more poorly constrained , and could easily be sufficient given our incomplete census of galaxies ( at @xmath13 our lower limit is only a factor of @xmath184 below the reionisation requirement ) .",
    "this interpretation may be consistent with the cmb temperature - polarisation correlation measurement from wmap ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) which indicates the universe was 50% reionized at @xmath253",
    ". however , we emphasize that the above assumes that the uv ionizing photons escape galaxies ; if star formation is dust obscured even at these high redshifts , or if the galaxy hi is optically thick to these photons , then our inferred past star formation may be insufficient to provide the necessary ionizing background .",

    ", we concentrated on 31 objects for which either spectroscopic or robust photometric redshifts from goods - music were available .",
    "a further 14 of these were eliminated from our analysis due to irac - confusion with neighbouring sources , which could not be satisfactorily removed .",

    "nine were detected at irac wavelengths , and six of these showed evidence for significant balmer/4000  spectral breaks , brightening across the break by up to a factor of @xmath140 in @xmath114 .",
    "these indicate the presence of old stellar populations that dominate the stellar masses of these galaxies , with inferred ages of @xmath6myr , and stellar masses of @xmath255 . during the sed modelling process , we considered the possibility of intrinsic dust reddening , and also the effects of differing metallicities and imf models .",
    "we do not find evidence of substantial dust reddening in our @xmath3-drop galaxies , and using differing metallicities did not have any significant effect on our derived properties .",
    "use of a chabrier , rather than salpeter imf had little effect on our inferred galaxy ages , but did reduce our stellar mass values by @xmath5% due to a mass re - scaling .",
    "the results of the sed fitting of the three other fainter irac - detected sources were inconclusive .",
