    "we should emphasize here that this upper bound is always independent of the actual coupling constants @xmath12 . on the other side",
    ", the condition  ( g ) also tells us that the residues of the function in   at all poles are negative . in conjunction with the coupling condition  ( c ) , this implies @xmath17 for all those @xmath18 for which the coupling constant @xmath19 is finite .",
    "unless it happens that @xmath20 is a zero of the function @xmath15 , this constitutes a necessary restriction on the sign of the coupling constant @xmath19 in order for a solution of the coupling problem to exist . roughly speaking",
    ", the coupling constants are expected to have alternating signs beginning with non - negative ones for those corresponding to the smallest ( in modulus ) positive and negative element of @xmath0 .",
    "motivated by these considerations and the nature of our applications , we introduce the following terminology .",
    "coupling constants @xmath4 are called admissible if the inequality @xmath21 holds for all those @xmath18 for which @xmath19 is finite .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is to prove that this simple condition is sufficient to guarantee unique solvability of the corresponding coupling problem .",
    "if the coupling constants @xmath4 are admissible , then the coupling problem with data  @xmath12 has a unique solution .",
    "apart from this result , we will also establish the fact that the solution of the coupling problem depends in a continuous way on the given data .",
    "let @xmath22 be a sequence of admissible coupling constants that converge to some coupling constants @xmath12 ( in the product topology ) .",
    "then the solutions of the coupling problems with data  @xmath23 converge locally uniformly to the solution of the coupling problem with ( admissible ) data  @xmath12 .    in the simple case when the set @xmath0",
    "consists of only one point , it is possible to write down solutions explicitly in terms of the single coupling constant .",
    "suppose that @xmath24 for some nonzero @xmath25 so that @xmath26 from the very definition , we readily see that some @xmath4 is admissible if and only if the coupling constant @xmath27 is not a negative real number . in this case , the unique solution @xmath7 of the coupling problem with data  @xmath12 is given by @xmath28 which has to be interpreted in an appropriate way when @xmath27 is equal to zero or not finite . otherwise , when the coupling constant @xmath27 is a negative real number , the coupling problem with data  @xmath12 has no solution at all .",
    "the following observation sheds some light on what happens in the general situation , when the coupling constants are not necessarily admissible .",
    "let @xmath4 be coupling constants and define the sequence @xmath29 by @xmath30 where the set @xmath31 consists of all those @xmath18 for which @xmath19 is finite and @xmath32 since the coupling constants @xmath33 are admissible , there is a unique solution @xmath7 of the coupling problem with data @xmath33 .",
    "now one can show that the coupling problem with data  @xmath12 is solvable if and only if the function @xmath15 vanishes on the set @xmath31 . in this case , the solution of the coupling problem with data @xmath12 is unique and coincides with the solution of the coupling problem with data @xmath33 .",
    "before we proceed to the proofs of our results , let us point out two applications that constitute our main motivation for considering this coupling problem for entire functions .",
    "first and foremost , the coupling problem is essentially equivalent to an inverse spectral problem for second order ordinary differential equations or two - dimensional first order systems with trace class resolvents .",
    "this circumstance indicates that it is not likely for a simple elementary proof of our theorem to exist , as the uniqueness part allows one to effortlessly deduce ( generalizations of ) results in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , which had to be proven in a more cumbersome way before . on the other side , the coupling problem is also of relevance for certain completely integrable nonlinear wave equations ( with the camassa ",
    "holm equation @xcite , @xcite and the hunter",
    " saxton equation @xcite being the prime examples ) when the underlying isospectral problem has purely discrete spectrum . for these kinds of equations",
    ", the coupling problem takes the same role as riemann ",
    "hilbert problems do in the case when the associated spectrum has a continuous component ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , the stability result for the coupling problem enables us to derive long - time asymptotics for solutions of such nonlinear wave equations @xcite .      as a prototypical example",
    ", we are going to discuss the spectral problem for an inhomogeneous vibrating string @xmath34 on the interval @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a complex spectral parameter and @xmath37 is a positive borel measure on @xmath35 representing the mass distribution of the string .",
    "we impose a growth restriction on the measure @xmath37 to the extent that the integral @xmath38 is finite . despite both endpoints being potentially singular",
    ", these conditions guarantee that the associated dirichlet spectrum @xmath0 is a discrete set of positive reals such that the sum   is finite ( we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 ) for details ) .",
    "this fact is reflected by the existence of two solutions @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the differential equation   with the asymptotics @xmath41 such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are real entire functions of genus zero .",
    "because the spectrum @xmath0 consists precisely of those @xmath36 for which the solutions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are linearly dependent , we may infer that the function @xmath2 defined by   is nothing but the wronskian of these solutions , that is , one has @xmath44 where we take the unique left - continuous representatives of the derivatives .",
    "our interest here lies in a particular associated inverse spectral problem which consists in recovering the borel measure @xmath37 from the spectrum @xmath0 and the sequence of accompanying norming constants @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 in order to work out the connection to the coupling problem , we first mention that for every eigenvalue @xmath18 one has the relation @xmath47 which is somewhat reminiscent of the coupling condition .",
    "furthermore , the growth and positivity condition will be due to the fact that the function @xmath48 is a herglotz ",
    "nevanlinna function for all @xmath49 . as a final ingredient",
    ", it remains to note the identity @xmath50 upon simply normalizing the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 at zero , we are now in the position to observe the following : _ for every given @xmath49 one has @xmath51 where the pair @xmath7 is the unique solution of the coupling problem with ( admissible ) data  @xmath12 given by _",
    "hence we are able to retrieve the measure @xmath37 from the spectrum and the norming constants by means of solving a family of coupling problems .",
    "in particular , this guarantees that @xmath37 is uniquely determined by the given spectral data , a fact that usually requires considerable effort @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more generally , the coupling problem can also be employed to solve analogous inverse spectral problems for indefinite strings as in  @xcite or canonical systems with two singular endpoints .",
    "let us consider the camassa ",
    "holm equation @xmath53 which arises as a model for unidirectional wave propagation on shallow water @xcite .",
    "associated with a solution @xmath54 is the family of spectral problems @xmath55 whose significance lies in the fact that their corresponding spectra are independent of the time parameter @xmath56 . in the case",
    "when @xmath54 is real - valued and such that the integral @xmath57 is finite for one ( and hence for all ) @xmath56 , the common spectrum @xmath0 is a discrete set of nonzero reals such that the sum   is finite . apart from this , these assumptions also guarantee the existence of two solutions @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the differential equation   with the spatial asymptotics @xmath60 such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are real entire functions of genus zero .",
    "the function @xmath2 defined by   is precisely the wronskian of these solutions ; @xmath63 independent of time @xmath56 . for every eigenvalue @xmath18",
    ", we therefore may write @xmath64 with some real - valued function @xmath65 . the crucial additional fact for this to be useful",
    "is that the time evolution for these quantities is known explicitly and given by @xmath66 of course , this simple behavior of the spectral data is highly exceptional and only due to the completely integrable structure of the camassa ",
    "holm equation .",
    "before we are able to substantiate the importance of the coupling problem in this context , we are left to note that the function @xmath67 is a herglotz ",
    "nevanlinna function for all @xmath68 and @xmath56 with @xmath69 after taking the normalizations of the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 at zero into account , we may now state the following : _ for any given @xmath68 and @xmath56 , we have @xmath70 where the pair @xmath7 is the unique solution of the coupling problem with ( admissible ) data  @xmath12 given by _",
    "thus we may recover the solution @xmath54 by means of solving coupling problems whose data are given explicitly in terms of the associated spectral data at an initial time .",
    "since we are going to employ de branges theory of hilbert spaces of entire functions  @xcite to establish the uniqueness part of our theorem , we begin with summarizing some necessary notation .",
    "first , an entire function @xmath72 is called a _ de branges function _ if it satisfies the inequality @xmath73 for all @xmath36 in the open upper complex half - plane .",
    "associated with such a function is a _ de branges space _ @xmath74 .",

    "the de branges functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 are normalized by @xmath89 2 .",

    "in fact , if some @xmath20 was a multiple zero of @xmath14 or @xmath15 , then @xmath20 would have to be a zero of the function @xmath2 as well since the function in   is a herglotz  nevanlinna function . as this means that @xmath20 belongs to the set @xmath0 , the coupling condition would then imply that @xmath20 is a zero of both functions , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , so that the function in the numerator of   would have a zero of order greater than two at @xmath20 , which constitutes a contradiction .",
