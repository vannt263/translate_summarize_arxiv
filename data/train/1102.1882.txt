    "opera  @xcite is a hybrid experiment based on electronic detectors ( ed ) and nuclear emulsions .",
    "it is exposed to the long - baseline cngs beam  @xcite from cern to the gran sasso underground laboratory ( lngs ) 730 km away from the neutrino source .",
    "the main purpose of the experiment is the observation of @xmath2 to @xmath3 oscillations in the direct appearance mode .",
    "the @xmath3 are identified through the measurement of the @xmath4 leptons produced in their charged current ( cc ) interactions .",
    "the neutrino runs started in 2008 and a first @xmath3 candidate has recently been observed  @xcite . the beam is mainly composed of @xmath2 ; interactions due to the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 contamination amount to 2.1  % , 0.80  % and 0.07  % of the @xmath2 cc event rate . in the following sections the @xmath2 interactions collected in the 2008 and 2009 runs , corresponding to @xmath0 protons on target ( p.o.t . )",
    "are analysed with fully operating ed , which have taken data for more than 98  % of the active beam time .",
    "the ed are of many uses in the opera analysis flow besides their crucial role in the trigger , in the location of the interaction point in the target volume and in the muon identification process .",
    "thus , in this paper we discuss the opera ed performances in event selection , muon identification , momentum and charge reconstruction and calorimetry measurements .",
    "the main features of the opera ed are presented first , followed by a review of the mc simulation and of the event reconstruction procedure .",
    "cc and neutral current ( nc ) interactions measurements are then discussed .",
    "the nc to cc ratio , the muon momentum spectrum , the reconstructed energy and the hadronic shower profile are investigated and a detailed comparison with a mc simulation is presented .",
    "this analysis is also a benchmark to establish the quality of the mc simulation related to the ed .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : opera_detector ] , the opera detector  @xcite is composed of two identical super - modules ( sm ) .",
    "each of them has a target section composed by target walls filled with lead / emulsion bricks alternated with walls of scintillator strips that constitute the target tracker ( tt ) .",
    "each target wall contains about 2920 bricks and only 53 walls out of 62 are filled .",
    "a brick is a mechanical unit which contains 57 emulsion films interleaved with 56 1 mm thick lead plates .",
    "the transverse size of the brick is 12.8 @xmath8 10.2 @xmath9 .",
    "each emulsion film has two 44 @xmath10 m thick emulsion layers deposited on a 205 @xmath10 m thick plastic base .",
    "each tt wall is composed of a pair of orthogonal scintillator strip arrays with an effective granularity of 2.6 @xmath8 2.6 @xmath9 and has a surface of 6.7 @xmath8 6.7 m@xmath11 transverse to the beam direction .",
    "strips are read out via wave length shifting ( wls ) fibres connected to multi - anode photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the total masses of the lead / emulsion bricks and scintillator strips are about 1.25 and 0.3 kton , respectively .",
    "a muon spectrometer at the end of each sm is used to identify muons and to measure their momentum and the sign of their charge .",
    "each spectrometer consists of a dipolar magnet with two arms made of 12 iron plates ; the measured magnetic field strength is 1.52 t. the two arms are interleaved with 6 vertical drift - tube planes , the precision trackers ( pt ) , for the precise measurement of the bending of the muon tracks .",
    "planes of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) are inserted between the iron slabs of the magnets , 11 planes in each arm .",
    "each rpc plane , 8.7 @xmath8 7.9 m@xmath11 transverse to the beam direction , is equipped with two orthogonal sets of copper readout strips .",
    "these planes provide a coarse tracking , a range measurement of the stopping particles and a calorimetric analysis of the hadrons escaping the target along the incoming neutrino direction .",
    "two planes of resistive plate chambers ( xpc ) , with the read out strips tilted by @xmath12 42.6@xmath13 with respect to the horizontal , are also placed after each target section to solve left / right ambiguities in the track pattern recognition .",
    "together with the rpc , the xpc are used to provide an external trigger to the pt .",
    "a 10 @xmath8 9.12 m@xmath11 anti - coincidence glass rpc detector , the veto , is placed in front of the first sm to exclude ( or tag ) interactions occurring in the material and in the rock upstream of the target .",
    "although the ed are not conceived to perform calorimetric measurements , they can be used for this purpose with a coarse resolution .",
    "an example of a cc event as seen by the opera ed is shown in the top part of figure  [ fig : ccnc ] , where the long tail of hits easily identifies a very high momentum muon track .",
    "the bottom part of figure  [ fig : ccnc ] shows a nc event .",
    "the connection between the ed and the nuclear emulsion data is described in  @xcite .",
    "( 15.5,9 . )",
    "( 15.5,9 . )",
    "( 9.0,0.0)@xmath14 coordinate ( cm ) ( 9.0,4.4)@xmath14 coordinate ( cm ) ( 2.4,1 . )    90 @xmath15 coordinate ( cm )    ( 2.4,5.5 )    90 @xmath15 coordinate ( cm )",
    "cc interactions can occur in the quasi - elastic ( qe ) , resonant ( res ) or deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) regimes . in the qe and res",
    "processes the hadronic system observable in the detector is faint as most of the incoming neutrino energy is transferred to the final state lepton .",
    "conversely in the dis process a prominent hadronic system is observed in the detector . in order to get a prediction for the number of expected neutrino interactions in opera , the differential neutrino cross sections , @xmath16 , for the cc - dis , cc - qe and cc - res processes on an isoscalar target , known from other experiments  @xcite , are convoluted with the cngs neutrino flux .",
    "the mean energy of the incoming beam is 17.7  gev  @xcite if the long tail extending above 100  gev is not included . only 0.6 % of the total flux has an energy exceeding 100  gev , this corresponds to less than 4  % of the @xmath2 cc event rate on an isoscalar target  @xcite .",
    "once the detector target mass and the number of recorded p.o.t . are defined , the absolute prediction for the expected number of interactions is computed together with the relative fractions of each process .",
    "the cc - dis , cc - qe and cc - res fractions are corrected for the non - isoscalarity of the materials used in the opera detector .",
    "the cc - dis process is found to be dominant with a fraction exceeding 90  % . using the procedure outlined in reference  @xcite ,",
    "the nc to cc ratio on an isoscalar target is predicted to be 0.31 , while it is 0.29 once the non - isoscalarity corrections are taken into account .",
    "hence the nc contribution is also fixed . only nc interactions in the deep inelastic scattering regime",
    "are considered as final state particles have to be observed in the ed .",
    "the final states for the different processes , cc - dis , cc - qe , cc - res and nc - dis , are generated using the neg mc program  @xcite , developed in the framework of the nomad experiment  @xcite .",
    "the neg mc is supplied with the cngs neutrino spectrum up to 400 gev .",
    "the generated events can then be mixed according to the appropriate fractions .      for the event simulation in the target ,",
    "neutrino interaction primary vertexes are generated in the lead / emulsion volumes as well as in the volumes of the tt scintillator strips .",
    "the lead represents 93  % of the target mass , the rest being emulsion films .",
    "neutrino interactions do not occur only in the target but also in the other opera detector structures , like the spectrometers , in any material present in the experimental hall , including the borexino  @xcite detector and its related facilities , and in the surrounding rock .",
    "the ratio between the number of recorded interactions occurring inside and outside the target is about 1 to 6 . as a consequence ,",
    "primary vertexes have been generated in all of the above mentioned volumes since final state particles from any of these volumes may easily reach the opera target . due to",
    "the asymmetric beam energy profile , with a tail at very high energy , a large enough volume of rock has to be considered .",
    "upstream of the detector a cylinder of rock , 35  m of radius and 300  m of length , has been used in the simulation .",
    "the rock volume surrounding the detector has the shape of a cylinder with a radius of 35  m and an inner empty volume corresponding to the lngs hall c shape hosting the opera detector .",
    "mc studies show that 99 % of the external events with hits reaching the opera detector are contained in a volume which is 35 % smaller than the simulated one .",
    "once primary vertexes are generated , the produced outgoing particles are propagated through the different simulated volumes and their interaction with matter , either with passive elements , like the rock , or with a sensitive detector volume , is performed using the geant3  @xcite virtual mc simulation package , version 1.10 .",
    "in order to provide a comparison with the data , the reconstruction of the simulated neutrino interactions is performed , using the same algorithms as for real data , and the efficiencies of the different analysis steps , such as the selection of neutrino interactions with the primary vertex contained in the target , nc vs cc event tagging or muon identification are evaluated .      the opera daq system  @xcite records with high efficiency all the interactions leaving a significant activity in the opera detector . to achieve this",
    "the ed data are actually acquired in triggerless mode since the read out of the front - end electronics is asynchronous with the data , time stamped with a 10 ns clock .",
    "a minimum bias filter is applied at the level of subdetectors in order to reduce the detector noise .",
    "the event building is then performed by collecting all the hits in a sliding time window of 3000 ns and requiring : hits in the @xmath15 and @xmath1 projections of at least two tt planes or a tt plane with the sum of the photomultiplier signals exceeding 1500 adc counts , and the presence of at least 10 hits . if a muon track is present in the final state , the trigger efficiency of the daq system , estimated with mc methods , exceeds 99  % . even in the worst configuration where a @xmath17 to @xmath18 oscillation occurs followed by a qe @xmath18 interaction and a @xmath4 to @xmath19 decay , the trigger efficiency , averaged over the @xmath17 energy spectrum , exceeds 95  % .",
    "cosmic ray induced events are also recorded  @xcite but they can be easily rejected as they are not on time with the cngs beam",
    ". therefore an almost pure sample of 31576 interactions on time with the beam , with the primary vertex contained inside or outside the opera target , was obtained for the 2008 - 2009 neutrino runs . as events occurring in the target",
    "represent a small fraction of the total number of recorded events an automatic algorithm , opcarac  @xcite , identifies such events , called hereafter ",
    "contained \" events .",
    "the contained events are more precisely those located in the target volume actually filled with bricks , this volume is fully instrumented by the tt , the walls of which being larger than the target walls . events not fulfilling this requirement are called hereafter  external \" events . the opcarac algorithm efficiency , estimated as the ratio between the number of mc events generated in the target volume and selected as contained to the total number of mc events generated , is high , as shown in table  [ tab : car ] , in particular for cc events .    the external events are mostly due to cc interactions occurring in the rock surrounding the detector .",
    "the final state muon is crossing the full detector or entering from the sides .",
    "these events are easily identified and rejected by opcarac .",
    "the presence of the veto system is particularly helpful when the muon is entering the detector from the front .",
    "the number of recorded external events with this topology was compared to mc expectations .",
    "data and mc are in agreement within the 10  % error on the expected number of @xmath2 cc events due to the uncertainty on the total beam flux and on the @xmath2 cc cross section .",
    "further mc studies show that cc events occurring in the rock surrounding the hall c volume , in which the final state muon escapes detection , can also generate secondary particles produced at large angle with respect to the incoming neutrino direction and hence reaching the target volume . in this case",
    "the observed activity is mainly concentrated at the edges of the tt .",
    "these events appear as low activity nc events .",
    "dedicated mc studies show that the spatial distribution of the low activity nc events measured in data and mc agree within the quoted 10  % uncertainty . due to the low activity in the ed these events are difficult to distinguish from genuine nc events occurring in the target .",
    "the contribution of nc interactions outside the target volume to the external event sample was checked through mc to be 20  % of the overall external sample . in order to keep the efficiency for nc events occurring in the target high ,",
    "a contamination of external events is unavoidable .",
    "while the cc sample is basically free of external events , the contamination of the nc sample is at the 10  % level and 3  % for the whole nc+cc sample .",
    "+        when a particle is tracked through the volume occupied by the rpc planes , one or more adjacent hit strips are created and the corresponding times are recorded .",
    "nine planes in each super - module are also used to generate a fast trigger signal used as an external trigger by the drift tubes of the pt .",
    "this trigger signal is also accurately computed in the simulation . due to the different width of the horizontal and vertical sets of readout strips ,",
    "a slightly different efficiency is implemented in the mc simulation .",
    "the efficiency in the mc is tuned from the observed multiplicity of vertical and horizontal strips measured for neutrino induced muon tracks . from these data and from cosmic ray data , the average strip efficiency measured in situ exceeds 95 % .",
    "the stability of the performances is monitored using cosmic ray data .",
    "if a charged particle passes through the gas filled volume of a pt drift tube , the hits in this volume are recorded as well as the corresponding time .",
    "the hit nearest to the sense wire is taken to determine the drift time using a drift time to distance relation .",
    "in addition the drift time is smeared using a resolution function .",
    "the time information of the rpc hits in planes contributing to the trigger are used to generate a trigger time .",
    "the signal propagation delays in all corresponding cables and in the rpc strips are taken into account for a realistic simulation of the trigger time delay .",
    "the resulting trigger time is then subtracted from the time of the drift tube hit and this difference is used as an offset for the drift time .",
    "thus trigger effects and the time of flight between the trigger planes and the drift tubes are properly accounted for .",
    "also the signal propagation delay on the drift tube wires and the signal cables is taken into account . in the simulation , the single tube efficiency",
    "is set to 99 % .",
    "if no trigger is generated in a super - module , no drift tube data is saved for this super - module . the time to distance relation , the resolution function and the single tube efficiency",
    "have been determined using a test setup outside the lngs , with the same operational parameters as used onsite .",
    "detector alignment is performed during dedicated cosmic ray runs without magnetic field . in situ , performances are monitored using cosmic ray data .      when a particle is tracked through the volume occupied by a tt scintillator strip ,",
    "the energy deposited and the time are recorded .",
    "a corresponding light signal is generated , and the attenuation and the delay in the propagation through the strip via the wls fibre up to the corresponding photomultiplier channel is computed .",
    "the signal is converted into a number of p.e . with the chosen threshold ( 1/3 of p.e . ) , the mean detection efficiency for a minimum ionising particle crossing the strip in the middle is higher than 99 % . to make the detector description as realistic as possible the cross talk has also been included , i.e. the possibility that the signal deposited in one tt strip is recorded on a neighbouring photomultiplier channel .",
    "calibrations are periodically performed and efficiencies , obtained from neutrino interaction data or cosmic ray data , are compared to the mc simulation . using mc data , it is then possible to correlate the visible energy in the tt with the incoming neutrino energy . in the presence of an energy leakage from the tt into the spectrometer ,",
    "the rpc data are also explicitly taken into account by the algorithm .",
    "the energy resolution reached is shown in figure  [ fig : res ] ."
