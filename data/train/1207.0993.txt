    "in 4-dimensional general relativity , no - hair theorem @xcite guarantees that a neutral rotating astrophysical black hole is uniquely described by the kerr metric which only possesses two parameters , the mass @xmath4 and the rotational parameter @xmath5 . for the kerr black hole ,",
    "the fundamental limit is the bound @xmath6 , and the central singularity is always behind the event horizon due to the weak cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite .",
    "however , the hypothesis that the astrophysical black - hole candidates are described by the kerr metrics still lacks the direct evidence , and the general relativity has been tested only for weak gravitational fields @xcite . in the regime of strong gravity , the general relativity could be broken down and astrophysical black holes might not be the kerr black holes as predicted by the no - hair theorem @xcite .",
    "several parametric deviations from the kerr metric have been suggested to study observational signatures in both the electromagnetic @xcite and gravitational - wave @xcite spectral that differ from the expected kerr signals .",
    "recently , johannsen and psaltis proposed a deformed kerr - like metric @xcite suitable for the strong field of the no - hair theorem , which describes a rotating black hole ( we named it the non - kerr black hole ) in an alternative theory of gravity beyond einstein s general relativity .",
    "the non - kerr black hole possesses the following novel features : there is no restriction on the value of the rotational parameter @xmath5 due to the existence of the deformation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , for a positive parameter @xmath0 , the non - kerr black hole becomes more prolate than the kerr black hole and there are two disconnected horizons for high spin parameters , but there is no horizon when @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , for a negative parameter @xmath0 , the non - kerr black hole is more oblate than the kerr black hole , and the horizon always exists for an arbitrary @xmath5 and the topology of the horizon becomes toroidal @xcite .",
    "the non - kerr metric is an ideal spacetime to carry out strong - field tests of the no - hair theorem .",
    "therefore , a lot of effort has been dedicated to the study of the rotating non - kerr black hole recently @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the properties of the thin accretion disk in the rotating non - kerr spacetime and found that the presence of the deformation parameter @xmath0 changes the inner border of the disk , energy flux , conversion efficiency , radiation temperature , spectral luminosity and spectral cut - off frequency of the thin accretion disk . moreover , for the rapidly rotating black hole , the effect of the deformation parameter @xmath0 on the physical quantities of the thin disk becomes more distinct for the prograde particles and more tiny for the retrograde ones .",
    "these significant features in the mass accretion process may provide a possibility to test gravity in the regime of the strong field in the astronomical observations .",
    "the power energy for a active galactic nuclei , x - ray binaries and quasars has always been concerned in the high energy astrophysics .",
    "several mechanisms ( i.e. the accretion disk model @xcite and blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite ) have been proposed to interpret how to extract energy from a black hole and the formation of the power jet .",
    "furthermore , the penrose process @xcite also provides an important method to extract energy from a black hole .",
    "the penrose process was also extended to the five - dimensional supergravity rotating black hole @xcite , higher dimensional black holes and black rings @xcite , and hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate in detail the ergosphere of the non - kerr black hole and how the deformation parameter @xmath0 of the non - kerr black hole affects the negative energy state and the efficiency of the energy extraction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we review briefly the metric of the rotating non - kerr black hole proposed by johannsen and psaltis @xcite to test gravity in the regime of the strong field and then analyze the ergosphere structure . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the efficiency of the energy extraction by using the penrose process .",
    "iv is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "to test gravity in the regime of the strong field , johannsen and psaltis @xcite , starting from a deformed schwarzschild solution and applying the newman - janis transformation , constructed a deformed kerr - like metric which describes a stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat vacuum spacetime . in the standard boyer - lindquist coordinates ,",
    "the metric can be expressed as @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 the constant @xmath0 is the deformation parameter .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 or @xmath11 corresponds to the cases in which the compact object is more prolate or oblate than the kerr black hole , respectively . as @xmath12 , the black hole",
    "is reduced to the usual kerr black hole in general relativity .",
    "the horizons of the black hole are described by the roots of the following equation @xcite @xmath13 clearly , the radii of the horizons depends on @xmath14 , which are different from that in the usual kerr case . for the case of @xmath10 , there exist two disconnected horizons for high spin parameters , but there is no horizon when @xmath1 . however , for @xmath11 the horizons never disappear for an arbitrary @xmath5 and the shape of the horizons becomes toroidal @xcite .",
    "the infinite redshift surface of a black hole is defined by the roots of @xmath15 . for the non - kerr black hole",
    "we note that @xmath15 gives @xmath16 obviously , for the case of @xmath17 , the outer infinite redshift surface is determined by @xmath18 . for @xmath11",
    ", it seems that both of the positive root of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the infinite redshift surfaces of the non - kerr black hole .",
    "however , the determinant of the metric @xmath21 vanishes if @xmath19 which shows that the surface defined by @xmath19 is an intrinsic singularity .",

    "the figure also shows that the surface defined by @xmath19 is the intrinsic singularity , because if we choose the surface defined by @xmath19 as the outer infinite redshift surface , we find that the metric of the non - kerr black hole does not satisfy @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the ergosphere and the causality of the spacetime is violated . thus the surface defined by @xmath19 can not be the infinite redshift surface .     of the rotating non - kerr black hole .",

    "a novel feature of the ergosphere of a black hole is that the timelike killing vector becomes spacelike crossing the infinite redshift surface .",
    "an observer moving along the timelike geodesics can not remain static but stationary in the ergosphere due to the  frame - dragging effect \" @xcite . according to the properties of the ergosphere",
    ", the deformation parameter @xmath0 should satisfy following relation @xmath38 in this range of @xmath0 , the non - kerr black hole has a event horizon given by largest root of @xmath24 , and a outer infinite redshift surface described by @xmath39 when @xmath40 or @xmath41 there is no the event horizon and the singularity becomes naked .",

    "for @xmath42 ( such as @xmath43 ) , the non - kerr black hole becomes more prolate than the kerr black hole , and the ergosphere in the equatorial plane becomes thick as the parameter @xmath0 increases .",
    "it should be pointed out that , when @xmath0 exceed @xmath44 , the horizons become disconnected . for the case of @xmath45 , there exist the inner and outer horizons which coincide at the north and south poles , and the thickness of the ergosphere decreases when the deformation parameter @xmath0 takes a bigger negative value . for @xmath1 , @xmath0 can only take a negative value , and both the horizon and infinite redshift surface are not closed .",
    "a hole appears around the north and south poles in the range @xmath46 .",
    "thus a distant observer may see the central region of this compact object along the north or south pole .",
