    "dilute atomic and molecular gases at ultracold temperatures ( @xmath0  millikelvin ) offer the fascinating opportunity of long observation time allowing for measurements with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "for instance , due to their extremely low relative velocity in such gases , particles have their maximal presence probability at large mutual distances @xmath1 , well beyond the range of electron exchange . therefore the dynamics of ultracold gases is dominated by their weak long - range ( van der waals ) interaction varying as @xmath2 , which is isotropic for identical particles in free space with spherical symmetry ( like atoms , or molecules with vanishing total angular momentum ) .",
    "once the particles are immersed in an external magnetic or electric field , their intrinsic properties ( permanent magnetic or electric dipole moment ) induce the anisotropy of their long - range interaction , which can now vary as @xmath3 and depends on the relative orientation of their molecular axis , or of their angular momentum @xcite .",
    "manifestations of anisotropic interactions have already been observed experimentally with ultracold quantum degenerate gases of magnetic atoms @xcite , and during ultracold collisions between krb polar molecules ( _ i.e. _ possessing a permanent electric dipole moment in their own frame ) @xcite . such so - called ultracold dipolar gases are expected to reveal novel physical phenomena for instance in the context of quantum degeneracy where hamiltonians involved in condensed matter physics could be simulated with the opportunity for controlling the interaction between particles with external fields ( see for instance the review papers of refs.@xcite ) . as for molecules , the recent review articles of refs.@xcite",
    "provide in - depth presentations of theory and experiments of collisions and reactions with ultracold molecules , emphasizing on their implications in the development of the new research area of ultracold chemistry dominated by quantum mechanical effects @xcite .",
    "despite amazing experimental progress , the main challenge for experimentalists dealing with ultracold molecules is still their formation as a gaseous sample with sufficient number density and with a good control of their internal state .",
    "an overview of the various methodologies to create ultracold neutral molecules and of their potential opportunities and applications is available in several review articles @xcite , and we will not cover them here . in brief , there are two classes of approaches to obtain ultracold ground state molecules : ( i ) manipulating pre - existing polar diatomic or polyatomic molecules with external magnetic or electric fields to design slow molecular beams @xcite , and for some specific polar species , cooling diatomic molecules with laser @xcite ; ( ii ) associating a pair of ultracold atoms into an ultracold molecule using laser photoassociation ( pa ) toward an electronic excited state followed by radiative emission ( re ) to the ground state @xcite , or magnetoasssociation ( ma ) @xcite in a weakly bound level of the electronic ground state manifold via magnetically tunable feshbach resonances @xcite , with a subsequent stimulated radiative transfer ( srt ) process to populate the lowest molecular bound level of the ground state .",
    "we focus for the rest of this paper on the latter option ( ma+srt ) , which has been successfully demonstrated experimentally in a still limited number of cases with homonuclear molecules like cs@xmath4 @xcite and rb@xmath4 @xcite , and heteronuclear molecules like krb @xcite and rbcs @xcite .",
    "this is a quite general method for the class of alkali - metal diatomic molecules which all possess a wealth of feshbach resonances ( see ref.@xcite for kcs isotopologues ) .",
    "the population transfer toward the lowest bound level of the ground state is achieved via the well - known coherent process of stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap , @xcite ) .",
    "the efficiency of the transfer relies on the identification of a pair of so - called pump and dump electric dipole allowed transitions with comparable rabi frequencies , and thus on the detailed knowledge of the spectroscopy of the molecule of interest . in a previous paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i , we modeled the stirap approach for the bosonic and fermionic krb molecules . using up - to - date spectroscopic data",
    ", we analyzed the efficiency of several transition schemes over the entire range of accessible laser frequencies determined by the excited electronic states , and we confirmed the suitability of the experimentally chosen scheme for krb .",
    "we also investigated stirap efficiency on a limited range of frequencies for rbcs @xcite .",
    "our study concerns the formation of ultracold bosonic @xmath5k@xmath6cs and fermionic @xmath7k@xmath6cs polar molecules in their absolute ground state by stirap , which has not yet been achieved experimentally .",
    "the present investigation aims at guiding ongoing experiments in the choice of their laser set - up to implement the stirap scheme .",
    "its main outcome is that the most efficient stirap schemes do not generally correspond to the intuitive picture delivered by the franck - condon principle describing the strongest molecular transitions in terms limited to the spatial overlap of vibrational wave functions .",
    "the kcs species exhibits several specific properties which contrast with the krb one studied in paper i. it possesses an intrinsic permanent electric dipole moment ( pedm ) of 1.92  d almost 4 times larger than the krb one @xcite .",
    "the potential well depth of the kcs molecular ground state being larger than the cs@xmath4 one , but smaller than the k@xmath4 one , the kcs molecule is stable in its lowest ground state level against ultracold collisions with surrounding cs atoms and other kcs molecules @xcite , but not with surrounding k atoms .",
    "these features will represent a decisive advantage for their further manipulation to create for instance a quantum degenerate molecular gas without the request of trapping molecules inside an optical lattice .",
    "moreover , the kcs spectroscopy has been already quite well investigated experimentally for the x@xmath8 ground state and the lowest triplet state a@xmath9 @xcite , and for several excited states @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of kcs feshbach resonances based on these results has also been modeled in detail @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first recall in section [ sec : model ] the basic principle of stirap , and we characterize the initial , and final molecular electronic states chosen for the implementation of stirap in @xmath5kcs and in @xmath7kcs ( the index for the cs mass will be omitted in the rest of the paper ) .",
    "the choice of the intermediate state for stirap is discussed in section [ sec : interm ] , emphasizing on the necessary knowledge of the requested molecular structure data , _",
    "i.e. _ potential energy curves ( pecs ) , transition electric dipole moments ( tedms ) and spin - orbit couplings ( socs ) .",
    "three transition paths for stirap in kcs relying on different kinds of couplings between molecular levels are identified and their efficiencies are compared among each other ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "experimental prospects are discussed in section [ sec : prospects ] in the perspective of the extension of such studies to other alkali - metal polar diatomic species .",
    "when appropriate , the atomic unit of length ( @xmath10  nm ) and of dipole moment ( 1  a.u.@xmath11 2.541 580 59  d ) will be used .",
    "the stirap principle has been proposed by bergmann _ _ et al.__@xcite and further discussed for instance in ref.@xcite in the context of coherent photoassociation of ultracold atoms .",
    "we also presented a summary in paper i and we only recall here a few aspects which are relevant for the present study .    the central idea of stirap is to adiabatically transfer the population of a quantum system from an initial state @xmath12 to a well - defined final state @xmath13 via an intermediate excited state @xmath14 , in such a way that the @xmath14 state is actually not populated .",
    "this is achieved by cleverly shaping two laser pulses overlapping in time inducing the @xmath12 @xmath15 @xmath14 ( pump ) transition and the @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath13 ( dump ) transition .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system dressed by the pulses admits a `` dark '' eigenstate which can not radiatively decay and insures the transfer from @xmath12 to @xmath13 without loss of population .",
    "one can show that the optimal efficiency of the transfer is reached when one finds a level @xmath14 such as the amplitude of the time - dependent rabi frequencies @xmath16 for the pump and dump transitions are equal .",
    "in eq.([eq : stirap-1 ] ) @xmath17 is the electronic transition dipole moment function ( tedm ) , and @xmath18 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) is the amplitude of the laser field driving the pump ( resp",
    ". dump ) transition , associated to an intensity @xmath20 ( resp @xmath21 ) .",
    "this equality is achieved either with equal tedm matrix elements for the pump and dump transitions assuming equal intensities for both pulses which is often convenient in experimental setups , or by slight adjustments of the laser intensities within the experimental feasibility to approach the strict equality of the rabi frequencies .",
    "here @xmath13 is the lowest level @xmath22 of the x@xmath8 electronic ground state of kcs , and @xmath12 is a weakly - bound level of the x@xmath8 and a@xmath9 state manifolds ( hereafter referred to as the x and a states ) coupled by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "figures  [ fig : pecs-0 ] and [ fig : pecs-1 ] display two possible choices of excited electronic state for the intermediate state @xmath14 that are discussed below .    the weakly - bound initial state @xmath12 results from the magnetoassociation of a pair of ultracold @xmath5k ( or @xmath7k ) and cs atoms by tuning an external magnetic field onto a feshbach resonance of the pair . such a so - called feshbach molecule is populated in a high - lying rovibrational level with a combination of triplet ( @xmath23 ) and singlet ( @xmath24 ) characters .",
    "the mixing coefficients depend on the choice of the feshbach resonance , experimentally investigated in ref.@xcite and accurately modeled in ref.@xcite . for a molecular system",
    ", there is an additional requirement for stirap to work , that the radial wavefunctions of the @xmath12 and @xmath14 on one hand , and of the @xmath14 and @xmath13 levels on the other hand should overlap each other in a region where the tedms are not vanishingly small . as it can be seen from figs.[fig : pecs-0]a and [ fig : pecs-1]a , this is well achieved if the @xmath12 levels contains a significant component on the a@xmath9 state which has an inner classical turning point in the suitable range of @xmath1 . just like in paper i ,",
    "the first hypothesis of our model is to choose @xmath12 with a pure triplet character , so that one can describe it with a radial wavefunction belonging to the single a@xmath9 pec with approximately the same binding energy as the one of the feshbach molecule bound level .",
    "this is the case of the uppermost a@xmath9 level assigned to @xmath25 with a binding energy of about 0.05  ghz at zero magnetic field , which possesses a triplet character up to 95% @xcite .",
    "note , however , that a pump transition starting from a pure singlet level would , in principle , be possible ( see the dashed arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : pecs-0]a ) but is not discussed further here .",
    "such an assumption is reasonable , as even if there is a significant singlet component in the chosen level , the nodal structure of the triplet component of the radial wavefunction will not be affected in the region of the inner turning point of the a@xmath9 pec , while its amplitude may be changed .",
    "therefore the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stirap-1 ] ) would be affected only through a global scaling factor .",
    "an example of such a wave function concerns a level resulting from the mixture of two a@xmath9 levels ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and two singlet levels ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) ( see fig.6 of ref.@xcite ) . in a recent proposal , klincare _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a stirap implementation based on a pump transition mainly acting around the outer turning point of the x pec , using a similar hypothesis of a pure singlet weakly - bound level as the @xmath12 state .",
    "the @xmath14 state must be optically coupled to both @xmath12 @xmath30@xmath31 and @xmath13 @xmath30 @xmath32 and thus must exhibit favorable transition dipole moments and good spatial overlaps with @xmath12 and @xmath13 vibrational wavefunctions . as in paper",
    "i , such a mixed singlet / triplet character is offered by the excited electronic states converging to the k(@xmath33 ) + cs(@xmath34 ) dissociation limit , namely b@xmath35 , a@xmath8 , c@xmath9 and b@xmath36 , hereafter referred to as b , a , c and b states respectively ( see figs.[fig : pecs-0]a and [ fig : pecs-1]a ) .",
    "these states are significantly affected by the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction , resulting in coupled states with both spin characters , labeled with the hund s case @xmath37 quantum number @xmath38 for the projection of the total electronic angular momentum on the molecular axis . in order to provide predictions to the experimentalists , it is crucial to rely on all available spectroscopic information about these states , so that the corresponding pecs are built piecewise , combining spectroscopic and quantum chemistry determinations .",
    "note that the implementation proposed in ref.@xcite relies on a higher electronic excited state , the ( 4)@xmath8 state correlated to the k(@xmath33)+cs(@xmath39 ) dissociation limit , perturbed by neighboring triplet states .",
    "unlike the krb case , our study of the @xmath40 symmetry has been greatly facilitated by the extensive spectroscopic study from refs.@xcite , providing the relevant pecs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pecs-0]a ) and @xmath1-dependent spin - orbit couplings ( soc ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pecs-0]b ) . following these authors",
    ", we use a four - coupled - channel model which accounts for the dominant so interaction between the a@xmath8 state and the @xmath40 component b@xmath41 of the b@xmath35 state , as well as the interaction with other molecular states responsible for the asymmetric splitting between the @xmath42 components of the b@xmath35 state .",
    "in addition it includes the weak rotational interactions with the other @xmath43 components b@xmath44 and b@xmath4 of the b@xmath35 state , scaling with @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the kcs reduced mass .",
    "the resulting @xmath1-dependent potential energy matrix is expressed , for a given total angular momentum @xmath47 ( including the total electronic angular momentum and the rotation of the molecule , but not the nuclear spins , and @xmath48 ) , as the sum of born - oppenheimer ( bo ) pec matrix @xmath49 and soc matrix @xmath50 @xmath51 for compactness purpose we used the notations for the potential energies including the centrifugal term : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "this matrix reduces to a @xmath56 form if @xmath57 .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , the labels `` so '' and @xmath58 in @xmath59 are approximate , referring to the dominant so interaction .",
    "we will keep them in the following , for convenience .    for the bound level calculations , we extend the experimental pecs of the a and b states at large distances with a @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) expansion using the @xmath62 coefficients from ref.@xcite . at large distances the functions @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 reach the so constant of the cs atom , i.e. @xmath66 . the constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 are empirically adjusted to take the relevant off - diagonal interaction into account . all those terms are obtained using the analytical formulas given in refs.@xcite . for completeness , we also report in fig .",
    "[ fig : pecs-0]b the soc functions which were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite prior to the spectroscopic analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , showing a remarkable agreement between the two determinations .",
    "the amazing quality of the spectroscopic data for the \\{b , a } complex allows calculating the energies of the @xmath40 levels with experimental precision .",
    "there are only a few observed levels assigned to levels with b@xmath35@xmath44 and b@xmath35@xmath4 character , so that the prediction of the energies of unobserved levels is not as accurate .",
    "however , as it has been experimentally demonstrated for rbcs @xcite , such a model indeed provides reliable information about these b@xmath35@xmath44 levels .    for the @xmath69 case , no full spectroscopic analysis for the b , c , and b coupled molecular states exists in the literature .",
    "computed the relevant @xmath1-dependent soc functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 with a quantum chemistry approach @xcite , and we used them in our model",
    ". the so hamiltonian matrix is expressed in a way similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : wso-0 ] ) as @xmath73 with @xmath74 for @xmath75b , c , b. the coupling functions are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : pecs-1]b , showing that they all converge toward @xmath76 .",
    "for the bound level calculations , we used as above the experimental @xmath77 pec @xcite .",
    "the c pec is obtained from our own quantum chemistry calculations based on semi - empirical effective core potentials ( ecp ) , following the procedure described in refs.@xcite , completed by the ecp parameters reported in ref .",
    "the spectroscopy of the bottom of the b pec has been achieved in ref.@xcite , which thus accounts for soc in an effective way .",
    "therefore we shifted it in energy before its connection to our own computed pec curve in order to ensure that the three - coupled - channel calculation actually delivers the correct energies for the measured levels .",
    "as above , these pecs are connected at large distances to an asymptotic expansion using coefficients from ref.@xcite .",
    "the treatment of the @xmath69 complex is not as accurate as the @xmath78 one , as there is no spectroscopic analysis available in the literature .",
    "however , the few spectroscopically observed vibrational levels at the bottom of the b state provide useful information for predicting a good stirap transfer using an @xmath69 intermediate level .",
    "in addition , tedm functions connecting the x and a states with the a , b , b , and c states from our own quantum chemistry calculations are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : pecs-0]c and fig .",
    "[ fig : pecs-1]c .",
    "note that as stated by kim _",
    "_ in their article @xcite , both our own pecs and tedms are in excellent agreement with their results .",
    "it is also worthwhile to remark that the tedms are quite similar to the krb ones , with an important difference however .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath79 is larger than its krb counterpart @xcite at the inner turning point of the a pec : @xmath80(@xmath1=9.5a.u . )",
    "@xmath81 in kcs , whereas in krb @xmath80(@xmath1=9.3a.u . ) @xmath82 .",
    "as discussed later , this order of magnitude difference will have important consequences for the experimental realization of the stirap approach based on @xmath40 states .",
    "our quantum chemistry data for pecs and tedms and the piecewise pecs elaborated above are provided in the supplemental material for convenience .    finally , according to the authors , the semiempirical curves and parameters derived in refs.@xcite are correctly mass - invariant , so that it is possible to use them to model the levels of the other isotopologues @xmath7kcs and @xmath83kcs .",
    "this is partly verified for the \\{b , a } complex by the ability of the semiempirical curves to reproduce a few measured levels @xcite of the @xmath83k@xmath6cs molecule . for x and a pecs ,",
    "the derived curves yield reliable scattering lengths for elastic collisions of each isotopic combination , thanks to the good quality of the long range part @xcite .",
    "in order to evaluate the relevant transition matrix elements ( tmes ) involved in the rabi frequencies in eq.([eq : stirap-1 ] ) , vibrational energies and radial wave functions are computed with the mapped fourier grid hamiltonian ( mfgh ) method @xcite as described in paper i. the hamiltonian operator governing the nuclear motion is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 refers to the kinetic energy operator .",
    "it is represented as a @xmath86 matrix where @xmath87 is the number of coupled channels and @xmath88 is the number of grid points for the @xmath1 coordinate determined such that the diagonalization yields eigenenergies reproducing the bound states energies at the experimental accuracy .",
    "the variable grid step at the heart of the mfgh method allows for accurately calculating bound levels with energies very close to the dissociation limit ( and thus with a large vibrational amplitude ) while limiting the number of grid points to about @xmath89 . the resulting vibrational wave functions @xmath12",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 , and @xmath13 @xmath30 @xmath32 , are then used in our calculations .",
    "the vibrational levels resulting from the diagonalization are labeled with an index @xmath90 referring to the global numbering of the increasing eigenenergies .",
    "the corresponding radial wavefunctions @xmath91 are expressed as linear combinations of the @xmath87 coupled electronic states @xmath92 the weight @xmath93 on each electronic state is defined by the squared radial components @xmath94 such as @xmath95 the tmes for the pump ( resp .",

    "@xmath97 ) of the a@xmath9 ( resp .",
    "x@xmath8 ) state and the triplet part @xmath98 ( resp .",
    "the singlet part @xmath99 ) of the coupled wave function of the intermediate level @xmath100 ( eq . ( [ eq : wf ] ) ) @xmath101 the squared matrix elements @xmath102 and @xmath103 determine the efficiency of the stirap process and are systematically calculated in the following .",
    "note that these tmes will have to be multiplied by the appropriate hln - london factors to take in account the experimentally chosen polarizations of the pump and dump lasers .    in the next sections , graphs for tmes will be drawn for the energy region where they are of comparable magnitude for the pump and dump transitions , for clarity .",
    "the full list of tmes are given in the supplementary material attached to the present paper .",
    "we considered the lowest allowed @xmath57 value for which the matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wso-0 ] ) reduces to a @xmath104 dimension .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme-0_39 ] for @xmath5kcs and in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme-0_40 ] for @xmath7kcs , the relevant tmes @xmath105 ( closed squares ) and @xmath106 ( closed circles ) .",
    "they are extracted from the calculations above , involving the coupling matrix of eq.([eq : wso-0 ] ) .",
    "as expected , their global behavior is very similar for the two isotopologues , but of course the recommended levels for the optimal transfer are slightly different , as summarized in table [ tab:0 + ] .",
    "the data points for @xmath107 ( closed circles in figs .",
    "[ fig : tme-0_39 ] and [ fig : tme-0_40 ] ) are associated to _ all _ eigenvectors yielded by the diagonalization , and of course related to the magnitude of their a component . the tmes present strong variations associated to levels with main mixed a - b@xmath41 character ( upper zone of the data points , associated to states with strong a component , alternating with states with strong b@xmath41 component ) , and to levels with main weight on the b@xmath44 state ( lower zone of the data , corresponding to states with very weak a component ) .",
    "the tmes reported for @xmath108 ( closed squares in figs .",
    "[ fig : tme-0_39 ] and [ fig : tme-0_40 ] ) correspond to states with either a main component on b@xmath41 or on a , disregarding those with main b@xmath44 character for clarity .",
    "thus this data is complementary to the upper part of the data for @xmath107 .",
    "thus the optimal stirap region for equal pump and dump transitions , exemplified in the figures by the selected @xmath109 level in @xmath5kcs and by @xmath110 and @xmath111 in @xmath7kcs , is located where the upper part of the a  @xmath15  x data crosses the a  @xmath15  b@xmath41 data ( with closed squares ) .",
    "note that the picture is qualitatively similar than the one obtained in paper i for krb , except that the b@xmath44 and b@xmath4 states were not included in the spin - orbit coupling matrix . however , the large @xmath1-dependent tedm around the inner turning point of the a pec in kcs compared to krb taken in similar conditions , namely starting from the uppermost level @xmath112 of the a state ( see table [",
    "tab:0 + ] ) induces a much larger tme than in krb , which makes this stirap scheme attractive for a future experimental implementation in kcs .    [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:1-bc ]",
    "the present investigation of the possible pathways for the formation of ultracold kcs molecules in their absolute ground state is a follow - up of our previous study on krb .",
    "but the current situation on the experimental side is very different for the two molecules .",
    "the formation of ultracold krb molecules in their absolute ground state via a stirap scheme has been undoubtedly boosted in part by the wealth of spectroscopic data available for the b@xmath36 state in the region of its pec minimum , with an accurate modeling of the perturbations by the b@xmath35 and c@xmath9 states induced by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "our complete analysis in paper i confirmed the choice of the experimental groups for the implementation of stirap based on the b ",
    "indeed , the weak tedm for the a@xmath113 b@xmath35 pump transition does not favor the implementation via the other a  b@xmath41 scheme relying on the spin - orbit coupled a@xmath8 and b@xmath35 states .    the situation is reversed for the kcs species which has not yet been observed in the ultracold regime .",
    "the spectroscopy of the coupled a@xmath8 and b@xmath35 states is much better known than the one of the b@xmath36 , b@xmath35 and c@xmath9 states .",
    "moreover , the large @xmath1-dependent tedm around the inner turning point of the a pec in kcs compared to krb induces a much larger tmes for the a  b@xmath41 and a  b@xmath44 schemes in kcs , which makes this stirap scheme attractive for a future experimental implementation .",
    "thus our study shows that there are more possible options than in krb to implement efficient stirap in kcs , namely , using either the a ",
    "b@xmath41 spin - orbit coupled states , the a ",
    "b@xmath44 rotationnally coupled states , or the b ",
    "c spin - orbit coupled states .",
    "note that the a ",
    "b@xmath44 case was not analyzed in paper i , but it has been successfully implemented in the rbcs experiment of ref.@xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of the relevant rbcs transition matrix elements are recalled in table [ tab:0 + -1 ] , which provide a reference for the experimental feasibility of such a scheme in the kcs case . in this respect",
    "the stirap scheme based on a ",
    "b@xmath44 coupled states is particularly attractive : it relies on the accurately known spectroscopy of the a  b coupled states .",
    "moreover , despite the very weak hyperfine structure expected for @xmath78 levels , their coupling with closeby @xmath69 levels identified in kcs , -which are expected to possess a large hyperfine structure- allows for controlling the hyperfine level during stirap , as achieved for rbcs .",
    "we also predict that the stirap scheme yielding the largest tmes for both the pump and dump transitions is the one based on the b ",
    "c spin - orbit coupled states , as observed in krb",
    ". however , its implementation would require further spectroscopic investigations , which may not be the priority of the interested experimental groups .",
    "generally , the presented study , just like the previous one on krb , demonstrates that the choice of an efficient stirap scheme to create ultracold molecules in their absolute ground state level can not be determined by invoking the franck - condon ( fc ) principle which only involves the spatial overlap of the vibrational wave functions .",
    "the variation of the relevant tedms along the internuclear distance plays a central role .",
    "moreover a reasonable balance of the tmes for the pump and dump transitions should be achieved , which generally corresponds to transitions departing from the most favorable ones identified by the fc principle . in this respect ,",
    "the provided supplementary material should be a great help for setting up an experiment .",
    "we anticipate that the present study comes at the appropriate time to guide future experiments aiming at creating ultracold samples of kcs molecules .",
    "the hyperfine structure not taken into account in this work will be modeled in an upcoming study and the stirap schemes will reexamined in this framework .",
