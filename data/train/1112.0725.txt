    "communications often suffer from severe inter - symbol interference ( isi ) due to doubly selective fading . in order to suppress the channel distortion ,",
    "channel equalization techniques are essential , and indeed have received considerable attention for many years .",
    "maximum a priori probability  ( map ) equalization is the optimum equalization procedure in terms of minimum symbol error rate ( ser )  @xcite , but requires a prohibitive computational complexity for many applications , being exponential in the channel length and constellation size .",
    "maximum likelihood sequence estimation ( mlse ) can obtain ser performance very close to map , but its complexity is still extremely high  @xcite . as a result , many sub - optimal , low - complexity equalization techniques have been proposed , such as the popular minimum mean square error decision - feedback equalizer , which is very effective in certain multipath environments and has a complexity that is only dependent on forward and backward filter lengths  @xcite . however , there is a non - negligible performance loss of mmse based equalizers in comparison to mlse  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "further still , while lots of research have been conducted on the time - domain equalization , few works take the special form of the channel representation into good account .",
    "two properties of the channel matrix in time domain are effectively utilized in this paper : 1 ) the toeplitz - like channel matrix significantly contributes to the equalizer design ; 2 ) the large number of zero elements reduces the computational complexity . as a result",
    ", we propose a robust _ approximate ml based decision feedback block equalizer _",
    "( a - ml - dfbe ) to combat isi over doubly selective fading channels with low computational complexity .",
    "the proposed equalizer exploits substantial benefit from the special time domain representation of the multipath channels by using a _ matched filter _",
    ", a _ sliding window _ ,",
    "a _ gaussian approximation _ , and a _ decision feedback_. the main ideas are firstly to subtract the effect of the already - detected signals obtained from past decisions .",
    "this can be treated as a decision feedback process .",
    "secondly we apply gaussian approximation  @xcite@xcite to realize near maximum likelihood detection .",
    "the accuracy of this procedure can be improved by adjusting the length of the sliding window due to the central limit theorem .",
    "consequently , a complexity and performance trade - off can be realized , and a convergence in ser performance can also be obtained by adjusting the length of the sliding window .    note that @xcite and @xcite can be used only for frequency flat fading channels , and @xcite aims to recover signals for multiuser systems .",
    "although in @xcite a probabilistic data association  ( pda ) based equalizer is reported , there are several major differences compared to the proposed approach : in @xcite , it requires to update the mean and the variance for all detected symbols ; many iterations have to be used in order to make the performance converge ; there is no feedback process ; and no matched filter is employed . in @xcite ,",
    "bidirectional arbitrated decision - feedback equalization  ( bad ) algorithm was presented which has complexity at least two times of the mmse - dfe but can achieve better performance . in @xcite ,",
    "a class of block dfe is presented for frequency domain equalization , but it assumes that the length of the channel , forward filter , and backward filter are infinitely long which is not practical . besides , it requires large number of iterations to make the performance converge , which increases the system delay and the computational complexity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the channel and signal models . the proposed a - ml - dfbe scheme and complexity comparisons are discussed in section iii .",

    "alternatively , they can also be decoded in complex form using standard zero forcing ( zf ) or mmse approaches , linear or decision feedback equalization  @xcite .",
    "the proposed equalization algorithm can be summarized into three steps : 1 ) forward process , which builds up the forward filter by a temporal sub matched filter ; 2 ) decision feedback process , which cancels the interference by a fixed length backward filter , and 3 ) approximate ml process , which realizes the final signal detection by the aid of gaussian approximation . the detailed description of each step is given below .      supposing we start decoding @xmath30 , a temporal sub matched filter  ( forward filter ) is applied to  ( [ eq : recmodel ] ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the matrix of size @xmath33 , which is made of the entries in @xmath29 , from the @xmath34-th column to the @xmath35-th column and from the @xmath36-st row to the @xmath20-th .",

    "note that ( [ eq : recforward ] ) is equivalent to ( [ eq : party ] ) when the _ vertical slicing _",
    "includes all the symbols in @xmath46 , @xmath59 , which implies the length of @xmath37 will have some effect on the system performance , and the effect of @xmath60 will be discussed further in the performance analysis and simulation results sections .",
    "we can write ( [ eq : recforward ] ) as @xmath61 where @xmath62 stands for the detected terms that can be rebuilt by the past decisions , @xmath63 is the current target , and @xmath64 represents the undetected terms .",
    "the function of the _ feedback process _ is to reconstruct @xmath62 for later interference cancellation .",
    "therefore , it is important to decide the length of the backward filter , @xmath65 . based on the expressions of @xmath29 and ( [ eq : partj ] ) , we have @xmath66 , and thus , the _ length _ of the _ backward filter _",
    "@xmath65 can be fixed at @xmath67 to reconstruct the effects of past decisions .",

    "we substitute ( [ eq : recforwardbackward ] ) into ( [ eq : backwardrestruction ] ) and get @xmath73 in order to decode @xmath74 with low computational complexity while maintaining the performance comparable to the ml decoder , we treat the undetected terms @xmath75 and the noise vector @xmath76 together as a new complex - valued gaussian vector with matching mean and covariance matrix , such that ( [ eq : afterbackwardrestruction ] ) can be expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents a vector with size @xmath79 of zero - mean complex - valued gaussian random variables with covariance @xmath80 where @xmath81 can be constructed by using the @xmath82-th column as the @xmath35-th column of @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be obtained by taking the @xmath85-th column to the @xmath35-th column of @xmath83 . according to the _ central limit theorem _ ,",
    "the _ accuracy _ of the gaussian assumption can be improved by increasing the length of the _ forward filter _ ( sliding window ) , @xmath37 .    as @xmath78 has an approximate gaussian distribution ,",
    "the likelihood function @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 finally , @xmath30 can be recovered by the following _ ml _ detector @xmath88 at @xmath89 , there are no more new received signals outside the sliding window .",
    "so , we can then simply decode each undetected symbol by treating the rest as gaussian term and removing the effects of the detected symbols .",
    "this decoding process is very similar to the case of @xmath90 by fixing the sliding window .",
    "the overall a - ml - dfbe algorithm is summarized in table [ tab : algorithm ] .",
    "before we show the complexity comparisons , we present how to further reduce the proposed equalizer complexity . note that , in ( [ eq : recforwardbackward ] ) , the detected terms @xmath71 can be rewritten as @xmath91 with size @xmath92 , where @xmath93^\\emph{t}$ ] has size @xmath94 . with respect to the diagonal element @xmath95 in @xmath46 , when @xmath96 , we can find that @xmath97 and thus , @xmath98 has the following form @xmath99,\\ ] ] which has size @xmath100 .",

    "similarly , in ( [ eq : a_ml_decoder ] ) , the calculation of @xmath103 and @xmath104 can be simplified as well .",
    "now , we discuss the complexity of the a - ml - dfbe , linear - mmse @xcite , mmse - dfe @xcite , and bad @xcite detectors in terms of the number of additions and multiplications .",
    "the resulting values are given in table [ tab : complexity ] , obtained by inspection of the relevant algorithms in table  [ tab : algorithm ] ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "details of the computation of complexity , for example the matrix inversion , can be found in@xcite .",
    "the computational complexity of the a - ml - dfbe algorithm is a function of the frame length  ( @xmath20 ) , the impulse response length  ( @xmath17 ) , and the length of the forward filter  ( @xmath37 ) , which is obtained on the basis of table .",
    "[ tab : algorithm ] . from the table , we observe that a - ml - dfbe has the same order of complexity as the linear - mmse and mmse - dfe .",
    "but a - ml - dfbe is less complex than mmse - dfe since the a - ml - dfbe requires smaller @xmath37 value , and it does not require to build up the backward filter . in comparison to linear - mmse , the a - ml - dfbe needs relatively even shorter forward filter and thus has lower complexity . the relation between the filter length and the performance",
    "can be clearly observed in the simulation results section .",
    "bad requires complexity at least double of mmse - dfe .",
    "note that with regard to computational complexity , we focus on time - domain implementation even though a low - complexity frequency - domain implementation is also possible by making use of the block - circulant structure that can be created by the guard interval .",
    "in addition , note that the matrix inversion lemma can be used to reduce the complexity from cubic to quadratic order , but it does not affect the above conclusions .",
    "in this subsection , we analyze the symbol error rate ( ser ) as well as the bit error rate ( ber ) performance of the a - ml - dfbe .",
    "note that the tail detection only contains the operation of very few symbols , and thus , the performance is dominated by step 2 of the a - ml - dfbe process in table [ tab : algorithm ] , which will now be analyzed .",
    "we assume that all the decisions are accurate for analysis , which is a normal assumption in decision feedback theory @xcite .",
    "in ( [ eq : a_ml ] ) , which contains correlated noise , @xmath105 , the pre - whitening filter , @xmath106 , can be applied to make the variance of the noise uncorrelated @xmath107 where @xmath108 with size @xmath79 has a gaussian distribution with zero mean and all components have unit variance .",
    "since the noise now has become white gaussian , the matched filter , @xmath109 , can be employed and we have the following received signal equation in scalar form @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , which is a scalar with zero mean and variance @xmath114 .",
    "the ser for @xmath115-psk constellation is given by @xcite @xmath116 where @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath115 denotes the constellation size .",
    "the average ber for @xmath115-`psk ` can be written as : @xmath119 where @xmath120 @xcite for high snr and gray mapping . since the tail is normally short , which has length @xmath121 , in comparison to the whole frame length @xmath20 , hence its",
    "effects can be neglected .",
    "note that in time - invariant channel , @xmath122 due to the property of @xmath46 ( @xmath123 ) by assuming perfect decision feedback at high snr .",
    "next , we analyze further the behavior of the proposed a - ml - dfbe at high snr . assuming perfect channel estimation at the receiver , and taking ( [ eq : serbpskkth ] ) as an example",
    ", it can be upper bounded by  @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 at high snr ( refer to appendix i for the derivation ) . in order to obtain good performance in terms of multipath combining and inter - symbol interference suppression , we should choose @xmath126 . then , by averaging ( [ eq : upperbound ] ) over the rayleigh pdf @xcite , equation ( [ eq : upperbound ] ) becomes @xmath127 which indicates that the a - ml - dfbe achieve the maximum multipath diversity order @xmath17 .",
    "it has been shown that the forward filter length , @xmath37 , is a very important parameter in the proposed a - ml - dfbe . in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the behaviors of @xmath37 : 1 ) increasing the value of @xmath37 can improve the robustness of ( [ eq : a_ml_decoder ] ) due to the following reasons : firstly , as shown in ( [ eq : partj ] ) , larger value of @xmath37 can incorporate more received signals as well as channel information in the forward filter ; secondly , indicated by ( [ eq : gaussaprox ] ) , increasing @xmath37 can make the gaussian assumption more accurate ; 2 ) while the performance can be enhanced , as shown in table [ tab : complexity ] , the complexity will correspondingly go up . hence , for a - ml - dfbe , a complexity and performance tradeoff can be realized by adjusting @xmath37 ; 3 ) performance gets converged by increasing the value of @xmath37 as the gaussian assumption becomes accurate enough .",
    "this implies that moderate length of the forward filter can deliver good performance ; 4 ) given by subsection - iv - b , @xmath37 should be equal or larger than @xmath17 for maximum diversity order ; 5 ) the length of the backward , @xmath65 , always equals @xmath128 due to the special structure of @xmath29 .      note that the matched filter in ( [ eq : hrec ] ) can obtain some additional information from the received signals outside the slicing window . recalling ( [ eq : party])([eq : recforwardbackward ] ) , @xmath129 can be written as @xmath130^t.\\ ] ] although some information is lost after horizonal and vertical slicing , some gains can be still realized by considering the whole received signal , @xmath131 .",
    "supposing the matched filter is removed , the detection procedures in table [ tab : algorithm ] can be used but it will lead to performance degradation since only the received signals inside the sliding window will be considered , where @xmath132^t$ ] . as a result ,",
    "the length of the forward filter has to be increased to make up the performance loss caused by the slicing processes in order to obtain the same performance .",
    "note also if the length of the forward filter is equal to @xmath20 , the a - ml - dfbe directly enters the tail detection step ( step * 3 * ) in table [ tab : algorithm ] , which will make no difference in performance whether or not the matched filter is used since there is no slicing operations at all .",
    "however , the value of @xmath37 is normally much less than @xmath20 . theoretically , using the same methods as shown in appendix i , it is easy to obtain the snr for the a - ml - dfbe when the matched filter is removed . due to the space limitation , we drop the detailed derivation part .",
    "but we can conclude that the performance of a - ml - dfbe can be upper - bounded by the same equalize without using the matched filter .",
    "in all simulations , bpsk constellation is used to generate a rate 1bps / hz transmission .",
    "we plot the ber versus the signal - to - noise ratio  ( snr ) . for analytical results ,",
    "we assume perfect decision feedback , but for simulated results we use the feedback decisions .",
    "the performance is determined over doubly selective rayleigh fading channels .",

    ", the length of the forward filter , @xmath37 , should be at least equal to @xmath17 in order to realize good performance . from fig .",

    "note that when @xmath153 , a - ml - dfbe gives almost the same performance as @xmath152 , which demonstrates that only a small value of @xmath60 is required to achieve good performance .",

    "it is shown that @xmath37 must be 15 for the system with no matched filter to provide the same performance as the matched filter system with @xmath148 .",
    "hence , from the simulation results we can see that the matched filter is very important for system performance . note that as discussed in the complexity analysis part , subsection iii - b , the forward and backward filter taps are actually fixed and can be obtained before the a - ml - dfbe detection .",
    "the complexity increase by the use of the matched filter is much more worthwhile than to increase the length of the forward filter without using the matched filter . in fig .",

    "we have shown that when @xmath37 is large enough , further increases in @xmath37 do not improve performance much .",
    "this implies that the proposed equalizer is quite robust against isi . a tradeoff in terms of the complexity and the performance",

    "computational complexity comparison has demonstrated that the a - ml - dfbe requires fewer additions and multiplications than mmse based schemes .",
    "in addition , the implementation of the matched filter is very important and the a - ml - dfbe obtains maximum diversity order when @xmath126 .    due to the dfe processing ,",
    "parallel computing is difficult to achieve for the proposed equalizer .",

    "<S> in order to effetively suppress intersymbol interference  ( isi ) at low complexity , we propose in this paper an approximate maximum likelihood  ( ml ) decision feedback block equalizer  ( a - ml - dfbe ) for doubly selective ( frequency - selective , time - selective ) fading channels . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed equalizer design makes efficient use of the special time - domain representation of the multipath channels through a matched filter , a sliding window , a gaussian approximation , and a decision feedback . </S>",
    "<S> the a - ml - dfbe has the following features : 1 ) it achieves performance close to maximum likelihood sequence estimation  ( mlse ) , and significantly outperforms the minimum mean square error  ( mmse ) based detectors ; 2 ) it has substantially lower complexity than the conventional equalizers ; 3 ) it easily realizes the complexity and performance tradeoff by adjusting the length of the sliding window ; 4 ) it has a simple and fixed - length feedback filter . </S>",
    "<S> the symbol error rate  ( ser ) is derived to characterize the behaviour of the a - ml - dfbe , and it can also be used to find the key parameters of the proposed equalizer . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we further prove that the a - ml - dfbe obtains full multipath diversity .    </S>",
