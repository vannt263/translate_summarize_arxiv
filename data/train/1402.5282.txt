    "in recent years , many distributions to model lifetime data have been introduced .",
    "the basic idea of introducing these models is that a lifetime of a system with @xmath0 ( discrete random variable ) components and the positive continuous random variable , say @xmath1 ( the lifetime of @xmath2th component ) , can be denoted by the non - negative random variable @xmath3 or @xmath4 , based on whether the components are series or parallel .",
    "+ some well - known lifetime distributions such as the exponential geometric ( eg ) , exponential poisson ( ep ) , exponential logarithmic ( el ) , weibull geometric ( wg ) and weibull poisson ( wp ) distributions introduced and studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",

    ", by combining a class of power series distributions and a linear failure rate ( lfr ) distribution , we will propose a new class of lifetime distributions .",

    "this family also includes the extended linear failure rate ( elf ) distribution which is introduced by @xcite . by putting @xmath15 , a new compound class of distributions which is called the rayligh - power series ( rps ) distributions is produced .",
    "we provide four motivations for the lfrps class of distributions , which can be applied in some interesting situations as follows : + ( i ) this new class of distributions due to the stochastic representation @xmath3 , can arises in series systems with identical components , where each component has the lfr distribution lifetime .",

    "( ii ) the lfrps class of distributions can be applied for modeling the time to relapse of cancer under the first - activation scheme .",

    "<S> we introduce in this paper a new class of distributions which generalizes the linear failure rate ( lfr ) distribution and is obtained by compounding the lfr distribution and power series ( ps ) class of distributions . this new class of distributions </S>",
    "<S> is called the linear failure rate - power series ( lfrps ) distributions and contains some new distributions such as linear failure rate geometric ( lfrg ) distribution , linear failure rate poisson ( lfrp ) distribution , linear failure rate logarithmic ( lfrl ) distribution , linear failure rate binomial ( lfrb ) distribution and raylight - power series ( rps ) class of distributions . some former works such as exponential - power series ( eps ) class of distributions , exponential geometric ( eg ) distribution , exponential poisson ( ep ) distribution and exponential logarithmic ( el ) distribution are special cases of the new proposed model .    </S>",
    "<S> the ability of the lfrps class of distributions is in covering five possible hazard rate function i.e. , increasing , decreasing , upside - down bathtub ( unimodal ) , bathtub and increasing - decreasing - increasing shaped . </S>",
    "<S> several properties of the lfrps distributions such as moments , maximum likelihood estimation procedure via an em - algorithm and inference for a large sample , are discussed in this paper . in order to show the flexibility and potentiality of the new class of distributions , </S>",
    "<S> the fitted results of the new class of distributions and some its submodels are compared using a real data set .    </S>",
