    "understanding how galaxies evolved from minute perturbations in the distant universe into the diverse zoo of shapes and sizes we see today is one of the fundamental goals of modern astronomy .",
    "the current frontier lies at the edge of the observable universe , @xmath9 after the big bang , and is primarily possible using the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) instrument aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . using the lyman - break technique and/or photometric redshifts to select candidate galaxies , programs such as candels ( pis faber & ferguson ) ,",

    "will extend our understanding even further to @xmath12 and uv magnitudes as faint as @xmath13 , greatly increasing the dynamic range of the observed galaxy population for study .    from these surveys , fundamental properties such as stellar mass , age and star formation rate ( sfr )",
    "can be derived by comparing the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies to stellar population models . by selecting galaxies at different epochs ( `` snapshots '' in time )",
    ", we can in principle directly observe how galaxies evolve .",
    "however , tracing galaxies from one epoch to another has proven challenging , and frequently accompanied by misinterpretation .",
    "previous studies have matched galaxies at different epochs by comparing samples selected to have similar physical tracers , such as at fixed uv luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this can be problematic as two galaxies , one at @xmath11=6 and the other at @xmath11=3 , with similar uv luminosities could have dramatically different mass assembly histories depending on their individual star formation histories ( sfhs ) , environments and/or merger histories .",
    "a novel approach to this problem was suggested by @xcite who tracked a population of galaxies through cosmic time ( @xmath11=2 to @xmath11=0.1 ) selected to have a constant number density , using the observed cumulative galaxy stellar mass function ( csmf ) .",
    "the critical assumption this approach makes is that galaxies in the same number density bin will grow at a similar , smooth rate with a conserved rank order .",
    "monte carlo simulations were utilized to test the effects of mergers and starbursts , and it was concluded that only 1:1 mass - ratio mergers were able to break the rank order of galaxies .",
    "the use of this technique was tested numerically by @xcite using the millennium dark matter ( dm ) halo catalog @xcite and semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "they found that the actual mass growth tracked the mass growth inferred at a constant number density to within @xmath14 over a redshift range of @xmath11=3 to @xmath11=0 .",
    "they note , however , that they did not reproduce the observed mass evolution of galaxies .",
    "this was attributed to the fact that the sub - grid physics ( star formation , feedback , mergers ) in the semi - analytic models utilized for their project might not be accurately capturing the physics of the observed galaxies .",
    "@xcite extended this technique to track the growth of observed galaxies at much higher redshift , from @xmath11=8 to @xmath11=3 , concluding that galaxies exhibit a sfh that _ increases _ with time ( contrary to previous assumptions of decaying sfhs , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this result has critical implications for the estimates of physical properties of observed galaxies . to justify the use of this method at high - redshift",
    ", the authors used the dm halo catalogs from the millennium simulations to track halo growth , making the assumption that halo growth directly tracks galaxy growth ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) . while they found that halo mass growth at a constant number density of @xmath16 was indeed smooth over the same time period",
    ", there was no consideration for the physics of formation and evolution of the galaxies themselves .",
    "a more recent numerical test at high-@xmath11 was performed by @xcite using the bolshoi dm halo catalog @xcite along with the merger tree and an abundance matching technique which assigns galaxies to halos based on their relative number densities .",
    "this study found that when comparing stellar mass evolution across redshift one must account for the fact the the number density of a given population is not constant to avoid mass estimate errors of @xmath17 dex . while the technique used by @xcite did extend to tracking descendants of @xmath11=6 galaxies",
    ", it did not explicitly include the details of fundamental physics involved in galaxy formation and evolution .    a contemporaneous work by @xcite utilized the illustris @xcite hydrodynamical simulations to test the constant number density evolution tracking method at @xmath18 , and found that galaxies do not evolve at constant number densities due to the effects of merger events and scatter in individual galaxies growth rates .",
    "we will show that these results are very consistent to this work even though focused on different redshift epochs .    in this work we will use cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamical code gadget-3 , where galaxies form in - situ , to test the technique of using constant cumulative number density as a tracer for tracking galaxy evolution at high - redshift ( i.e. @xmath19 ) .",
    "motivated by recent tests of this technique which rely the combination of dark - matter - only simulations with either abundance matching or semi - analytic models , we intend to capture the realistic mass assembly histories of galaxies in simulations with sophisticated baryonic physics .",

    "galaxies are selected based on symmetric number density bins as determined by the cumulative stellar mass function ( csmf , figure  [ fig : cmf ] ) from our simulation at @xmath11=7 . for our fiducial number density bin to select galaxies ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this number density can then be translated via the csmf to a corresponding stellar mass of @xmath75 at @xmath11=7 .",

    "full details of each number density bin studied can be found in table  [ tbl : data ] .",
    "the choices of the values for n2 and n3 are motived by covering a wide range of masses within our simulation mass resolution , with little to no overlap between populations .",
    "we do not explore higher number density ( lower mass ) values due to the restrictions set by our simulation s resolution ( see gray shading in figure  [ fig : cmf ] ) .",
    "we also do not explore values lower than n3 , as such a bin would have @xmath80 tracked galaxies , leading to poor number statistics .",
    "it should be noted that the symmetric number density bin leads to a slightly asymmetric mass bin ( i.e. more low mass galaxies ) , depending on the shape of the csmf at the selection redshift .",
    "however this choice allows for a constant number of galaxies at each redshift for a given number density , whereas a symmetric mass bin would lead to varying galaxy counts due to the changing shape of the csmf .",
    "the tracking of single galaxies across multiple snapshots is achieved through particle i d matching and the  most massive \" descendant / progenitor algorithm . the galaxy at each subsequent snapshot which contains the highest number of matching particles from the original galaxy is considered to be its descendant / progenitor .",
    "one downside to the `` most massive '' descendant / progenitor algorithm is that there are scenarios when the procedure is not completely reversible .",
    "for example , in merger events the progenitor path will choose the most massive of the two galaxies whereas the descendant path may have originated via the lower mass galaxy . to test the impact of this effect on our results we conducted a test with a random sample population of galaxies selected at @xmath11=7 .",
    "this population was tracked to @xmath11=3 and the final @xmath81 were used as a starting point for a progenitor track back to @xmath11=7 .",
    "we found that @xmath82 of the progenitor population differed from the original @xmath11=7 population .",
    "however , this difference only led to a median mass differential of @xmath83 dex .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the partial non - reversibility of the `` most massive '' algorithm utilized in this work has a negligible impact on our results .        ,",
    "though here for progenitors of @xmath3 3 galaxies . while again this technique appears to work on average , both the bias and the scatter of the constant number density tracking technique are larger when tracking progenitors than when tracking decendants . ]",
    "while the algorithm for tracking galaxies in the simulation is simple , in practice this is a non - trivial exercise .",
    "all group - finders introduce some amount of uncertainty when associating particles with a galaxy , especially during merger events .",
    "particles which were included in one snapshot can be excluded in the subsequent one , primarily those which are located more near the edges of the identified system .",
    "this uncertainty manifests itself as `` noise '' in the mass growth of each galaxy ( see jagged gray lines in figure .  [",
    "fig : m_evo_d ] ) .",
    "while this `` noise '' is aesthetically unpleasing , it does not affect the overall median growth trend .      throughout this work we will refer to the _ actual _ mass growth and the _ inferred _ mass growth of the studied galaxy population .",
    "the _ inferred _ growth refers to the mass assembly of the ensemble galaxy population as derived from the csmf by taking the mass associated with a constant number density cut at each redshift ( e.g. the orange line intersection with csmf in figure  [ fig : cmf ] ) .",
    "the _ actual _ mass growth is the mass assembly unique to each individual galaxy ( gray lines in figure .",
    "[ fig : m_evo_d ] ) determined at each snapshot as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : tracking ] . in each case",
    "the _ actual _ mass growth will be represented by the median of the distribution with the @xmath84 scatter represented by shading ( e.g. orange circles , orange shade figure .",
    "[ fig : m_evo_d ] ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig : m_evo_d ] we compare the inferred mass growth to the median of the actual mass growth for each galaxy in the n1 , n2 , and n3 bins .",
    "this comparison illustrates that the _ inferred _ growth tracks the _ actual _ mass growth on average , though there appears a systematic bias where the inferred mass growth is @xmath85 dex higher ( within a factor of @xmath86 in mass ) than the actual mass growth .",
    "this demonstrates that , on average , using constant cumulative number density to track the descendants of a population of galaxies through cosmic time can be an effective method of measuring stellar mass growth .",
    "this result is consistent with studies using the same techniques at lower redshifts @xcite and at high-@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we caution however that this is an _ on average _ result which has a large scatter ( @xmath87 dex ) which we will discuss in more detail in section  [ subsec : scatter ] and a systematic offset which suggest that evolution of the population must be considered ( see section  [ sec : evo ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : m_evo_d ] we also compare to stellar mass growth estimates obtained through observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that our simulations , on average , are reproducing the observed growth of galaxies selected from a bin similar to our n1 .",
    "as @xcite results were obtained using the evolving cumulative number density technique , it also serves as a good check that our simulations are reproducing the observed galaxy properties and evolution well .",
    "we also use our simulations to test the effectiveness of the constant cumulative number density technique to track the _ progenitors _ of a population of galaxies selected at @xmath11=3 . for the purposes of this study we are defining a galaxy progenitor to be it s most massive progenitor .",
    "we acknowledge that in a hierarchical galaxy formation scenario each galaxy is the aggregate of many progenitors of varied masses . however , from an observational perspective , it is impossible to link multiple progenitors to a single descendant . therefore we feel that our definition more closely approximates what can be observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : m_evo_p ] shows the mass assembly history of @xmath3 3 galaxy populations in the n1 , n2 , and n3 bins . as with the descendants , the constant cumulative number density technique , _ on average _ , reproduces the mass assembly history of the population of galaxies when compared to the _ inferred _ assembly , although with a larger bias of @xmath88 dex ( factor @xmath7 in mass ) .",
    "however , when using this technique to track progenitors the scatter in the individual galaxy history increases substantially to @xmath89 dex at @xmath11=7 ( figure  [ fig : m_evo_p ] ) , and is much higher than was seen when tracking descendants ( @xmath90 dex ) .",
    "further , we find that @xmath91 of the galaxies in the original number density bin at @xmath11=3 do not exist at @xmath11=7 , forming at various points between @xmath11=3 and @xmath11=7 .",
    "this population of `` late - forming '' galaxies substantially increases the scatter in the _ actual _ assembly history and thus increases the offset between the _ actual _ and _ inferred _ mass growth .",
    "it should be noted that we drop the late - forming galaxies from the calculation of average mass growth prior to their formation redshift to avoid including objects with zero stellar mass .",
    "we include more discussion regarding the impact of this `` late - forming '' galaxy population in section  [ subsec : late ] .",
    "the systematic offset between the _ actual _ and _ inferred _ mass growth suggests that the number density of the original population is evolving with redshift .",
    "this evolution can be seen in figure  [ fig : dens_evo ] which shows the evolution of the number density as a function of redshift for both descendants ( left ) and progenitors ( right ) , for each of our initial number density bins . the number density for each individual galaxy",
    "is obtained at each snapshot by relating its stellar mass to a number density via the csmf .",
    "all populations show a trend of increasing number density as a function of cosmic time ( with decreasing redshift for descendants , and with increasing redshift for progenitors ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the average _ actual _ mass growth of galaxies from each number density bin are growing slower than would be inferred from the csmf ( see offset between _ inferred _ and _ actual _ stellar mass growth in figures  [ fig : m_evo_d ] & [ fig : m_evo_p ] ) .",
    "this trend is highly consistent with findings from @xcite who utilized the bolshoi @xcite dark matter simulations and abundance matching ( see section  [ subsec : abund ] for further details ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : dens_evo ] we compare our linear best fit ( solid lines ) to the results from the public code provided by @xcite ; dashed lines .",
    "our work shows excellent agreement ( within @xmath92 dex ) with the evolution generated by the @xcite code over the studied redshift range .",
    "thus , in order to track galaxies more accurately through cosmic time one must utilize an _ evolving _ cumulative number density . by taking the average of the least square fit to the evolutionary trend for each population ( see least square fits in figure  [ fig : dens_evo ] ) of descendants of @xmath11=7 galaxies ( @xmath4 ) we find , @xmath93 similarly the number density of @xmath11=3 ( @xmath2 ) progenitors can be traced utilizing , @xmath94 we caution that these relations are only valid in the mass range and redshift range studied here ( @xmath0 ) . as pointed out in @xcite , the evolution changes at @xmath95 , therefore equations  [ eq : one ] & [ eq : two ]",
    "should not be extrapolated to lower redshifts .",
    "note that the mass ranges referenced above are derived from the overall number density range ( n1 , n2 , n3 ) at either @xmath967 for descendants or @xmath963 for progenitors ( see table  [ tbl : data ] ) .       of the @xmath967 population",
    "is recovered at @xmath963 . ]",
    "one method which has been used to quantify how well the constant cumulative number density method is tracking the evolution of the galaxy population is to examine the completeness fraction at each redshift , keeping the bin width constant .",
    "here we define the completeness fraction to be the fraction of tracked simulated galaxies which fall within the desired number density bin at a given redshift . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp ] we present the results of this study , where we find that only @xmath97 of @xmath11=7 descendants fall within the original number density bins at @xmath98 . for clarity",
    ", we only show results for the n1 bin , however , the results for the n2 and n3 bins are quantitatively similar .",
    "we do not present the completeness fraction for progenitors for reasons which we discuss in section  [ subsec : scatter ] .",
    "we also compare our results to those found in @xcite . to make this comparison we need to modify our definition of completeness to match that used in papovich et al .",
    "they define completeness as the fraction of galaxies with a number density of at most the value of the selection bin ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "our direct comparison to this definition can be seen by the dashed orange line . this definition results in a completeness fraction of @xmath100 , much lower than the @xcite result of @xmath101 . to obtain a similar result to the @xcite study we would need to expand our target mass bin at @xmath11=3 to @xmath102 dex .",
    "repeating both of the completeness calculations above , now applying the evolving cumulative number density leads to a completeness fraction of @xmath103 as defined in this work and @xmath104 for the @xcite definition .",
    "this makes our completeness fraction nearly identical to the @xcite result using their less restrictive definition .",
    "however , we see a modest increase of only @xmath105 at @xmath11=3 after applying the evolving cumulative number density when using our completeness definition . this discrepancy is likely due to the larger scatter between halo mass , galaxy mass and luminosity found in our simulations .",
    "the study by @xcite did not include any of these sources of scatter in their estimates .",
    "the results from the completeness fraction study are somewhat misleading as the width of the @xmath11=3 mass bin associated with the selected number density is smaller than the original @xmath11=7 mass bin by a factor of @xmath106 ( see table  [ tbl : data ] ) .",
    "the reduced mass bin width is the result of the steepening of the csmf over the redshift range studied , and it is the primary reason why we only see a modest completeness fraction increase of @xmath105 at @xmath11=3 when applying the evolving cumulative number density .",
    "if the mass bin width is fixed at the @xmath967 value of @xmath107 dex ( see table  [ tbl : data ] ) , the completeness fraction at @xmath963 rises to @xmath108 .",
    ", only here for progenitors of @xmath3 3 galaxies tracked to @xmath3 7 .",
    "the red histogram bar in the progenitor panel represents the population `` late - forming '' galaxies found in the progenitor study .",
    "progenitors of @xmath963 galaxies have a much wider distribution in both mass and number density that seen from descendants of @xmath967 ( see figure  [ fig : dscatter ] ) . ]    as demonstrated by the low completeness fraction , the majority of galaxies selected at @xmath11=7 are not falling within either the evolved or constant number density target bin at @xmath11=3 .",
    "it is therefore useful to constrain where the majority of these descendants fall on the csmf .",
    "figures  [ fig : dscatter ] and [ fig : pscatter ] shows the median number density evolution of simulated galaxies in our n1 bin plotted with the csmf at each redshift for descendants and progenitors , respectively .",
    "these figures synthesize much of the data provided in this work as it also includes information regarding the mass and number density distribution ( blue / orange histograms ) for both descendants and progenitors .    for the n1 bin descendants",
    ", we find that @xmath109 of galaxies fall in the n1 bin at @xmath11=3 , as discussed in section  [ subsec : comp ] , and the remaining galaxies are distributed either at higher number densities ( @xmath110 ) , or at lower number densities ( @xmath111 ) than the original number density bin .",
    "the overall scatter in stellar mass at @xmath11=3 is @xmath112 dex , which corresponds to a number density scatter which has a total width of @xmath113 dex , given the @xmath3 3 csmf . for progenitors of the n1 bin , we find that @xmath97 fall within the target @xmath3 7 number density bin with @xmath114 at higher number densities , and @xmath115 at lower number densities .",
    "this distribution leads to a stellar mass scatter of @xmath116 dex at @xmath11=3 , and a number density scatter with total width of @xmath117 dex .",
    "it should be noted that the `` late - forming '' galaxies discussed in section  [ sec : progen ] are included in the fraction of galaxies which fall above the n1 bin .",
    "however , they are removed from the sample at their formation redshift .",
    "therefore , they do not contribute to the median scatter ( gray shaded area in figure  [ fig : pscatter ] ) at @xmath963 .",
    "the n2 and n3 density bins have quantitatively similar results .",
    "it is interesting to consider the growth histories of galaxies which started in the selected number density bin at @xmath11=7 , and end up outside the bin at @xmath11=3 .",
    "we performed a test to determine the average growth rates of these populations of galaxies , calculating the average stellar mass at each time step of galaxies outside the bin ( separately for those with both higher and lower number densities ) .",
    "we find that these _ average _ growth histories show that these galaxies initially grow too quickly or too slowly ( moving to lower or higher number densities , respectively ) , jumping out of the selected number density bin , but after that , they grow at a relatively constant rate , similar to those galaxies inside the selected bin .",
    "therefore , there is no systematic difference in the growth histories of these galaxies ; rather , after they initially scatter out of the number density bin , they grow fairly similarly to the tracked population .    the fact that both the descendants and the progenitors have similar fractions of galaxies located in , above and below the original bin is misleading . as mentioned in section  [ subsec : comp ] , the slope of the csmf is steepening with decreasing redshift , resulting in a narrower number density bin at @xmath11=3 and a lower descendant completion fraction .",
    "this must also be considered when looking at progenitors as the bin is widening as we approach @xmath11=7 , thus making it more likely that a galaxy will fall within the selection bin ( i.e. higher completion fraction ) .    as demonstrated by the mass and number density histograms included in figure  [ fig : pscatter ] , even using an evolving cumulative number density selection results in a wide scatter in both number density and mass for progenitors .",
    "we conclude that using an evolving cumulative number density will allow for the tracking of _ average _ stellar mass for progenitors , but that this method is an insufficient tracer of individual galaxy descendant / progenitor evolution in our simulations , as nearly any bin on the @xmath11=3 csmf can be populated with galaxies that originated from nearly any point on the @xmath11=7 csmf .",
    "we show further evidence of this scatter and its impact in section  [ subsec : disc_scatter ] .",

    "it was found that an increase of a factor of @xmath119 from @xmath120 dex in stellar mass to @xmath102 dex in stellar mass at @xmath11=3 is required to recover @xmath118 of the original @xmath11=7 selected population ( see table  [ tbl : data ] ) . while a mass bin with a width of @xmath102 dex may not seem extreme , as it is comparable to the observed mass error estimates at @xmath98",
    ", it will contain thousands of galaxies that were not part of the original @xmath11=7 density bin , which may have very different mass assembly histories .",
    "this can be see in figure  [ fig:50 ] where the stellar mass distribution for a sample of @xmath121 galaxies were selected from the aforementioned @xmath118 bin .",

    "this exercise effectively demonstrates that even a moderate widening of the target mass bin will lead to substantial contamination from a diverse population of galaxies .",
    "this exercise also shows that a large scatter makes the application of either the constant cumulative number density or evolving cumulative number density technique limited to average population masses only .",
    "the diverse mass assembly histories of individual galaxies can make associating other properties such as age , metallicity , star - formation rate , etc .",
    ", untenable .",
    "the @xmath91 of @xmath11=3 progenitor galaxies found in our simulation to form after @xmath11=7 have a significant impact on the results of the progenitor portion of this study . in particular , the scatter of the stellar mass and number density evolution is increased by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "the high fraction , and significant impact of the `` late - forming '' population dictate that further discussion is warranted .",
    "specifically , there is the possibility that these galaxies are artifacts of our simulations due to resolution limitations .",
    "the large volume of our simulation box is chosen so that we can best represent the dynamic range of observed high redshift galaxies .",
    "the consequence of this design is that we are not resolving low - mass halos with @xmath122 at @xmath1237 .",
    "therefore , the possibility exists that a theoretical simulation box with unlimited mass resolution would have resolved these `` late - forming '' galaxies at an earlier redshift .    in a @xmath124cdm universe with a hierarchical structure formation scenario , it is possible",
    "that these galaxies would have then been merged into a higher mass galaxy by @xmath11=7 , thus reducing the scatter .",
    "it is also possible that no mergers took place which would leave the galaxy in a lower mass bin ( i.e. much higher on the csmf ) . in this scenario",
    "the scatter would remain largely unchanged . to properly study this issue ,",
    "a resolution test would be needed , which requires a simulation with a substantially higher particle count .",
    "unfortunately , such a hydrodynamic simulation is beyond the scope and resource of this study .",
    "there is also the possibility that the `` late - forming '' galaxies are very `` real '' , and representative of early galaxy formation .",
    "a simple calculation , exploring the growth rate required for a galaxy at @xmath11=5 with @xmath125 to reach the target stellar mass of @xmath126 by @xmath11=3 , demonstrates that such a galaxy would require a star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath127 over the @xmath128 gyr .",
    "this sfr is reasonable , given that a typical observed @xmath129 galaxy has an sfr@xmath130 at @xmath11=5 @xcite .",
    "this is without consideration for mergers , which could increase the stellar mass much more rapidly .",
    "therefore , there is no physical motivation for us to definitively conclude that the `` late - forming '' galaxies are mere resolution artifacts .",
    "we investigated the photometric properties of the putative `` late - forming '' galaxies to determine if it would be possible to detect @xmath11=3 observational signatures .",
    "more specifically , we examined the d4000 spectral indicator , which measures the relative strength of filters placed around the @xmath131 spectral features associated with calcium h and k lines @xcite . the strength of this break is correlated with age , as younger , high sfr galaxies will produce an increase of uv photons at wavelengths less than @xmath131 .",
    "the spectra of these galaxies will also contain less observable metal - line absorption , which will result in a decreased d4000 ratio .",
    "utilizing the bc03 @xcite population synthesis models to generate spectra for each of our simulated galaxies , we found that there is no significant difference in the d4000 break for `` late - forming '' galaxies as compared to the remaining studied population .",
    "it is likely that this is the result of a combination of merger events and rapid star formation that leads to the effective mixing of older stellar populations with the newly formed populations making the @xmath131 an unreliable age indicator for our galaxy population .",
    "when interpreting the results of this work , and other similar studies , it is critical to remember that number density is not a physical property of a galaxy ( i.e. unlike stellar mass , sfr , metallicity , etc . ) .",
    "the number density of any individual galaxy is dependent directly on the distribution function from which it is taken , in this case the cumulative stellar mass function .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : cmf ] , the csmf is evolving with decreasing redshift towards more galaxies at higher masses , but also toward a stronger high - mass exponential cut - off .",
    "there are two primary forces driving this evolution of the csmf over the studied redshift range : first , the stellar masses of existing galaxies are growing , which evolves the csmf to toward higher masses .",
    "second , new galaxies are forming and being included which , in a `` bottom - up '' hierarchical structure formation universe , will place them at higher number densities , effectively acting to steepen the exponential cutoff of the csmf .",
    "we caution that this steepening is not related to the faint - end slope of the stellar mass function as our dynamic range does not include faint - end mass galaxies .",
    "the steepening of the csmf cutoff directly results in the evolution of the cumulative number density in our simulations .",
    "this can be clearly demonstrated by examining the rise in cumulative number density for a given stellar mass bin as the exponential cutoff becomes more pronounced ( i.e. towards vertical ) .",
    "therefore , a population of galaxies can have smoothly rising mass assembly histories , as seen in figure  [ fig : m_evo_d ] , with no break in rank order , and still exhibit an evolving number density .",
    "this result is contradictory to the fundamental assumptions that are made in the constant cumulative number density technique , which has been shown to work at lower redshift ( @xmath132 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not however feel that our results invalidate the lower redshift results as the processes driving galaxy evolution are different during that more recent epoch ( i.e. driven by stellar mass growth and not new galaxy formation , with an increased impact of feedback on massive galaxies ) .",
    "based on the above evolution argument , one would expect that the progenitor number density evolution would then trend towards lower number densities at higher redshifts .",
    "we do not see this trend .",
    "in fact we find the opposite , with progenitors evolving to higher number densities ( figure  [ fig : pscatter ] , bottom ) .",
    "this can be explained by the impact of the large `` late - forming '' galaxy population acting to lower the median stellar mass growth ( figure  [ fig : m_evo_p ] ) , thus raising the cumulative number density .",
    "it must be noted that the steepening of the csmf in our simulations could also be the result of our mass resolution limitations as discussed in section  [ subsec : late ] .",
    "low mass galaxies which are unresolved would fall at higher number densities , and could therefore steepen our @xmath133 csmf , potentially eliminating the evolution seen in this work .",
    "cosmological volume hydrodynamic simulations with sufficient dynamic range to test this effect are beyond the scope of this work based on the computational resources required .",
    "the agreement with the @xcite results is rather remarkable given the differing approaches taken to arrive at these conclusions . in the @xcite work an abundance matching technique is employed .",
    "this technique converts the cumulative number density corresponding to a galaxy s stellar mass at a given initial redshift to a dark matter halo mass with the same cumulative number density from the dark matter - only bolshoi simulation halo catalog .",
    "the progenitors / descendants of these halos are then tracked within simulation using a similar ` most - massive ' algorithm @xcite . at the terminal redshift the mass of each halo",
    "is then converted back to a cumulative number density using the dark matter halo cumulative mass function @xcite .    at the core of the abundance matching technique",
    "is the fundamental assumption that halo mass accretion , whether it be through mergers or via the cosmic web , directly traces the galaxy stellar mass growth hosted within .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption given that we know that the baryonic matter in the universe directly traces the underlying dark matter distribution @xcite .",
    "it does not however account for the complicated physics of how this gas accretes onto galaxies and ultimately is converted into stars .",
    "this absence of fundamental physics is the primary motivation for this work .",
    "the utilization of cosmological sph simulations is the next logical step in testing these galaxy - tracking techniques , as they include both the underlying dark matter structure and the complicated hydrodynamic physics associated with the gas within ( i.e. heating , cooling , chemistry ) .",
    "these simulations are also able to convert gas into stars via physically motivated sub - grid physics as well as account for the impact of star formation ( i.e. supernova and stellar winds ) on further star formation .",
    "this allows for galaxies to form in - situ with their respective dark matter halos , while computing the gas infall rate from cosmic filaments in a cosmological setting correctly .. therefore we are able to directly track galaxy stellar mass growth without the need to make any assumptions regarding the relationship between the galaxy and the halo it resides within .",
    "the drawback to utilizing these types of high resolution sph simulations is that they are computationally very expensive .",
    "this limits the dynamic mass range and redshift range we are able to study when compared to dark matter only simulations ( i.e. bolshoi , millennium ) , which resolve lower mass structures . to probe this topic further ,",
    "a combination of theoretical techniques is likely warranted .",
    "using the cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamical code gadget-3 we make a realistic assessment of the validity of the technique of using constant cumulative number density as a tracer of galaxy evolution at @xmath0 .",
    "our major conclusions are as follows :    * we find that , when utilizing the constant cumulative number density technique to track galaxies at @xmath0 , an average stellar mass can be determined to within a factor of @xmath86 for descendants and @xmath7 for progenitors ( figure  [ fig : m_evo_d ] & [ fig : m_evo_p ] ) .",
    "* the systematic offset between the _ inferred _ mass growth and the _ actual _ mass growth suggest that the number density of both progenitors and descendants is evolving with redshift .",
    "this evolving cumulative number density is in very good agreement with @xcite who find a similar evolution over the same redshift range ( figure  [ fig : dens_evo ] ) . * on average , the cumulative number density for the stellar mass ranges studied in this work ( @xmath4 ) can be found using , @xmath134 for descendants , and , @xmath135 for progenitors . *",
    "while the evolving cumulative number density is able to track the _ on average _ evolution of galaxies at @xmath0 , we find that there is a large scatter of @xmath136 dex for descendants at @xmath96 3 , and @xmath137 for progenitors at @xmath967 ( figures  [ fig : m_evo_d ] , [ fig : m_evo_p ] , [ fig : dscatter ] & [ fig : pscatter ] ) .",
    "individual galaxies demonstrate diverse mass assembly histories due to the physical processes of gas accretion , quenching , mergers and star formation . * when evaluating the completeness fraction , we find that only @xmath103 of descendants fall within the original number density bin by @xmath98 ( figure  [ fig : comp ] ) .",
    "this low fraction is due to the narrowing of the target mass bin which is caused by the steepening of the csmf . * increasing the number density bin width at @xmath963 to improve the completeness fraction of @xmath967 descendants to @xmath118 leads the contamination of the original sample by thousands of galaxies which have origins outside of the targeted number density bin .",
    "thus , significantly reducing the reliability of the evolving cumulative number density method .",
    "the technique of utilizing an evolving cut of cumulative number density is a powerful tool in tracking the _ average _ mass growth of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "this work demonstrates that galaxies in a given number density bin will have very diverse mass assembly histories even if they are of similar stellar mass .",
    "this diversity will reveal itself in the scatter of other physical properties of individual galaxies ( i.e. metallicity , age , sfr , star formation history ) , thus caution should be used when applying this technique to study physical properties other than stellar mass .",
