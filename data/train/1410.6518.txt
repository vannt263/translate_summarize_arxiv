    "there are several alternative and complementary approaches to model the dynamics of a plasma . for instance , kinetic theory describes a plasma from a microscopic point of view , including phenomena at the corpuscular scales described through their distribution function .",
    "on the other hand , mhd models describe more global phenomena at macroscopic scales using low order moments of the distribution function such as the particle density , the velocity of the flow and its pressure . however , the description at intermediate scales , i.e. in between the mhd and the kinetic scales are a subject of debate .",
    "in particular , the solar wind is an example of a space plasma for which this discussion is still open . with the aim of getting a better understanding of the nature of a magnetized plasma at intermediate scales and within the framework of a full two - fluid mhd description , retaining the effects of the hall current , electron pressure and electron inertia",
    ", we investigate the development of turbulent regimes throughout these scales .    an important feature to characterize a stationary and isotropic turbulent regime of a plasma",
    "is its energy spectrum @xmath7 , which provides the energy per unit wavenumber . at mhd scales ,",
    "i.e. at wavenumber below the inverse of the ion inertial length @xmath8 ( @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the speed of light and @xmath11 is the ion plasma frequency ) , the energy spectrum follows a @xmath2 scaling , i.e. a kolmogorov spectrum just as for neutral fluids .",
    "this power - law was predicted by @xcite for hydrodynamic turbulence , assuming isotropy and using dimensional analysis . using measurements of the solar wind at 1 , 2.8 and 5 au and assuming the taylor hypothesis , @xcite found energy spectra consistent with a kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "however , one fundamental difference between hydrodynamic turbulence and plasma turbulence is the presence of different wavenumber regimes with their corresponding power - law dependencies .",
    "solar wind observations have shown that the mhd range typically ends just at the ion inertial length , where the magnetic power spectrum exhibits a characteristic break @xcite . at wavenumbers larger than the inverse of the ion inertial length , i.e the hall - mhd range , the magnetic spectra exhibit steeper power laws @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the electron magnetohydrodynamic ( emhd ) turbulence in 2d and 3d systems . in the emhd approximation ,",
    "asymptotically valid at spatial scales much smaller than the ion inertial length , the ions are regarded as static ( because of their much larger mass ) and electrons are the only species to carry the electric current . in this regime , @xcite found that the energy spectrum follows a @xmath4 power law .",
    "this prediction was later confirmed by other numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the classical explanation for this turbulence regime is that it is associated with a cascade process involving dispersive waves , such as ion- cyclotron and/or whistler modes . in the context of 3d compressible mhd with and without the hall effect",
    ", @xcite analyzed the behavior of the magnetic and electric field fluctuations .",
    "the authors found that the turbulent magnetic field was almost unaffected by the presence of the hall term in ohm s law , while the electric field is modified at scales smaller than the ion skin depth and close to the dissipation range .",
    "furthermore , reconnection zones are identified , and the relative importance of each term in ohm s law was studied in real space . in this direction , @xcite examined the influence of the hall effect and the level of turbulence on the magnetic reconnection rate in 2.5d compressible hall mhd .",
    "their results indicate that the reconnection rate is enhanced both by increasing the hall parameter and the amplitude of the turbulence .",
    "the idea that mhd turbulence may play an important role in a magnetic reconnection setup was first proposed by @xcite by adding turbulent fluctuations on a two - dimensional sheet pinch configuration .",
    "it is also important to remark that several studies have shown that the magnetic reconnection rate might still depend on the value of the hall parameter @xcite or on the level of turbulent fluctuations @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found evidence of two breakpoints in the magnetic energy spectrum from solar wind observations obtained with the multi - spacecraft cluster .",
    "these results show a break at a wavenumber presumably consistent with the inverse ion inertial length @xmath12 ( as previously observed by @xcite and @xcite ) and a second break at a wavenumber correlated with the electron gyroradius @xmath13 ( where the perpendicular velocity is calculated with the thermal velocity and @xmath14 is the electron cyclotron frequency ) . however , in those observations the electron gyroscale @xmath15 was very close to the electron inertial length @xmath16 ( because @xmath17 ) , and therefore it was not clear to what characteristic scale can be attributed this breakpoint .",
    "the authors confirmed the kolmogorov spectrum at mhd scales , a second power law @xmath4 at hmhd scales above the ion inertial scale and a steeper power law @xmath18 above @xmath19 .",
    "other authors have found similar results @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite confirmed the kolmogorov law at the mhd scales , a power law @xmath20 at @xmath21 and an exponential decay around the electron larmor radius @xmath15 .    in summary ,",
    "the present study is consistent with results suggesting that the hall effect produces a steepening in the spectrum at the ion inertial length which does not involve energy dissipation @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to explore the physics of a complete two - fluid model without neglecting the electron mass .",
    "consequently , the system is able to distinguish two characteristic scales , the ion and electron inertial lengths .",
    "therefore , we call electron inertia hall - mhd ( eihmhd ) to a theoretical framework that extends mhd and hmhd , both of which can be regarded as particular cases . in particular , this level of description should not be confused with the emhd approximation @xcite , since we retain the whole dynamics of both the electron and ion flows throughout all the relevant spatial scales . we claim that the eihmhd framework is a way to partially bridge the gap between the fluidistic and kinetic descriptions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in section [ eih - mhd ] we develop the eihmhd model and present the ideal invariants of the model in section [ invariants ] . in section [ 2.5d ]",
    "we show the set of equations that describe the dynamical evolution of the problem in a 2.5d setup . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our main results and , finally , in section [ conclus ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the equations of motion for an incompressible plasma made of ions and electrons with mass @xmath22 , charge @xmath23 , density @xmath24 ( quasi - neutrality ) , pressure @xmath25 and velocity @xmath26 respectively , can be written as    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the magnetic and electric fields , @xmath32 is the electric current density , @xmath10 is the speed of light , @xmath33 are the viscosities and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the rate of momentum gained by ions due to collisions with electrons .",
    "this momentum exchange rate is assumed to be proportional to the relative speed between species .",
    "more specifically , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the collisional frequency of an ion against electrons . in view of equation , this momentum exchange rate ( or friction force between species ) becomes proportional to the electric current density @xmath32 .",
    "the total derivatives in equations  ( [ motionp])-([motione ] ) are @xmath38 and the conservation of mass for each species leads , in the incompressible case , to @xmath39 this set of equations can be written in a dimensionless form in terms of a typical length scale @xmath40 , the constant particle density @xmath41 , a value @xmath42 for the magnetic field , a typical velocity @xmath43 ( the alfvn velocity ) where @xmath44 and the electric field is in units of @xmath45 , @xmath46 where we have introduced the dimensionless parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 has the form of a plasma frequency for a particle of mass @xmath50 .",
    "the dimensionless momentum exchange rate is @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the ( dimensionless ) electric resistivity .",
    "the dimensionless ion and electron inertial lengths can be defined in terms of their corresponding plasma frequencies @xmath53 simply as @xmath54 .",
    "note that in the limit of electron inertia equal to zero , we obtain @xmath55 , and therefore @xmath56 reduces to the usual hall parameter .",
    "however , throughout this paper we are going to retain the effect of electron inertia through the parameter @xmath57 . for a fully ionized hydrogen plasma is @xmath58 and as a result @xmath59 .",
    "nonetheless , the current theoretical description may also be applied to an electron - positron plasma ( for which @xmath60 ) , since it is actually valid for all values of @xmath61 .",
    "the expressions for the dimensionless ion and electron inertial scales ( @xmath62 ) in terms of the two dimensionless parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 are simply @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    for a hydrodynamic description of this two - fluid plasma",
    ", we replace the velocity field for each species ( i.e. @xmath26 ) in terms of two new vector fields .",
    "namely , the hydrodynamic velocity @xmath67 given by @xmath68 and the electric current density @xmath32 given by . from equations - , we can readily obtain the velocity of each species as @xmath69 the hydrodynamic equation of motion is the sum of the corresponding equations of motion and , @xmath70 - \\boldsymbol\\nabla p + \\nu\\nabla^2\\textbf{u } + \\nu_0\\nabla^2\\textbf{j}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the total pressure , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . following the expressions obtained by @xcite and assuming both species to share a common temperature , the ratio of viscosities is only a function of the mass ratio , i.e. @xmath74 which shows that viscosity is predominantly due to ions .",
    "note that most of the terms in equation can easily be identified as a sum of the corresponding terms in equations - , but the convective derivatives in these equations are nonlinear terms that have also been properly taken into account , giving rise to a new nonlinear term in equation which is proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "note also that in the limit of negligible electron inertia ( i.e. , for @xmath75 ) , equation reduces to the equation of motion for traditional mhd .",
    "this is the case as well for the hall - mhd description , which is a two - fluid theoretical description , but considering massless electrons .    on the other hand , the equation of motion for electrons ( [ dlesse ] ) , using @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 being the electron vorticity )",
    "can be written as @xmath79 we define , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the hydrodynamic vorticity . taking the curl of equation ( [ mote ] ) it is possible to obtain a dynamical equation for the magnetic field @xmath82\\times\\textbf{b } ' } + \\eta\\nabla^2\\textbf{b } - \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\lambda\\nu_e\\nabla^2\\boldsymbol\\omega - ( 1-\\delta)\\lambda^2\\nu_e\\nabla^4\\textbf{b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations and are the eihmhd equations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the presence of the electron mass ( and the corresponding viscosity coefficient @xmath83 ) introduces high order derivative terms that play the role of hyperviscosity .",
    "this certainly has an impact at large wavenumbers , affecting the distribution of energy at the small scales and the dissipative range of the energy power spectrum .",
    "the major source of dissipation of magnetic field in a plasma where the electron mass is not neglected , is the friction between the electrons themselves and not the loss of momentum of the electrons by collision with ions ( as in the mhd and hmhd cases ) . this can be seen in the last term of equation ( [ dynb ] ) , which together with the second term ( on the right hand side ) came from the curl of the dissipative term in the fluid equation of electrons , a term that can not be neglected if we consider electron inertia ( and the resulting momentum and energy transport due to the electrons ) .",
    "it is also possible to obtain an equation for the electric field * e * making use of equations , , and the maxwell  faraday equation ( in dimensionless form ) , @xmath84 it is useful to consider this equation in fourier space to obtain a closed expression for the electric field .",
    "first the partial time derivative of equation in fourier space reads @xmath85 where @xmath86 since @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the fourier transform of an integrable function @xmath89 .",
    "rearranging terms and using equation in fourier space we get an equation for the electric field in fourier space as @xmath90 where the two right - hand side terms are calculated from equations and respectively as , @xmath91 the equation for the electric field is obtained applying @xmath92 to equation , which gives rise to the gradient of an undetermined function @xmath93 , which can be associated to the electrostatic potential .",
    "this function @xmath93 can be obtained from the poisson equation that results from taking the divergence of the equation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the electric field consists of four different contributions .",
    "an inductive part related to the @xmath94 term , a hall contribution related to @xmath95 term , the dissipative component and a new contribution associated with the non - zero electron mass ( i.e. , proportional to @xmath63 ) .",
    "in the ideal limit , i.e. neglecting dissipation terms ( see also @xcite ) , a multi - species plasma made of n species of individual mass @xmath96 , electric charge @xmath97 and particle density @xmath98 , satisfies the following equations of motion @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "we assume each species to be incompressible ( i.e. @xmath101 and @xmath102 , for @xmath103 ) and the plasma to be quasi - neutral , i.e. @xmath104 the electric current density will be given by @xmath105 such a plasma displays @xmath106 ideal invariants .",
    "one of them is of course the total energy @xmath107 , given by @xmath108 the other invariants are one helicity per species , i.e. @xmath109 where @xmath110 . in a fully ionized hydrogen plasma is @xmath111 and we therefore have three ideal invariants . in the hall - mhd limit",
    "we neglect the electron mass ( @xmath112 ) and as a result the total energy reduces to just the ion ( or bulk ) kinetic energy plus the magnetic energy ( see equation ) .",
    "also , the electron helicity ( see equation for @xmath113 ) reduces to the well known magnetic helicity @xmath114 , while the proton helicity corresponds to the hybrid helicity ( see for instance @xcite , also @xcite ) .    note that when the effects of electron inertia are retained ( i.e. @xmath115 ) , the regular magnetic helicity @xmath116 is not anymore an ideal invariant .",
    "for the two - fluid description being addressed in the present study , the dimensionless version of the three ideal invariants is @xmath117 all these are quadratic and global invariants .",
    "for instance , the energy density @xmath118 satisfies the following evolution equation @xmath119 where @xmath120 is therefore the energy flux .",
    "since the energy density is quadratic , an equation equivalent to also holds in fourier space as a result of parseval s theorem . in a stationary and isotropic turbulent regime ,",
    "the so called energy cascade corresponds to a constant energy flux in fourier space ( i.e. @xmath121 independent of @xmath122 ) , which is therefore equal to the energy dissipation rate @xmath123 .",
    "for instance , in the paradigmatic case of incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence , the modulus of the energy flux in fourier space goes like @xmath124 , which leads to the well known kolmogorov s energy power spectrum @xmath125 , simply using that @xmath126 and @xmath127 .    in the more complex case of eihmhd turbulence , there are many terms contributing to the energy flux in both physical and fourier spaces . symbolically , these various contributions are sketched in the following expression for the energy flux in fourier space , @xmath128 the presence in eihmhd of two physical lengthscales causes the appearance of three different regions in wavenumber space .    1 .",

    "<S> , we obtain an inertial range following a kolmogorov @xmath2 law . for intermediate wavenumbers such </S>",
    "<S> that @xmath3 , the spectrum is modified to a @xmath4 power - law , as has also been obtained for hall - mhd ( hmhd ) neglecting electron inertia terms . when electron inertia is retained , a new spectral region given by @xmath5 arises . the power spectrum for magnetic energy in this region </S>",
    "<S> is given by a @xmath6 power law . finally , when the terms of electron inertia are retained , we study the self - consistent electric field . </S>",
    "<S> our results are discussed and compared with those obtained in solar wind observations and previous simulations . </S>"
