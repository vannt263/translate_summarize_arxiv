    "the third - order quantum electrodynamical process of photon splitting in a strong magnetic field , currently popular in several astrophysical models of different neutron star sources , was first studied over three decades ago . due to analytic complexities encountered when investigating this interaction , it was not until the beginning of the 1970s that a body of correct and uncontroversial results emerged .",
    "these early splitting calculations used either effective lagrangian @xcite or variations of schwinger s proper - time techniques @xcite , the expediency of which yielded compact analytic forms for the rates when specializing to low energy ( ) or low field ( ) cases . after a hiatus of nearly two decades , photon splitting became of interest again in the literature @xcite following the publication of an s - matrix calculation in the landau representation of its rates by mentzel , berg and wunner@xcite , specifically because of their contention that the earlier works cited above had seriously underestimated the strength of this process .",
    "the rates computed in @xcite were later retracted in @xcite , with a sign error in their numerical coding having been discovered and corrected .",
    "mentzel et al.s analytic derivation was the first comprehensive presentation of the application of a landau representation technique specifically to magnetic photon splitting , though the qed formalism presented by melrose and parle @xcite virtually provided an equivalent enunciation of such s - matrix forms for splitting amplitudes .",
    "more recently , weise , baring & melrose @xcite confirmed the analytic derivation of @xcite .",
    "the landau representation calculations and most of the earlier effective lagrangian and proper - time presentations were generally applicable to non - dispersive regimes below the pair creation threshold ( ) , where the momentum vectors of the initial and final photons are collinear , and arbitrary field strengths .    below pair threshold , the effective lagrangian approach of @xcite and the proper - time calculations in @xcite",
    "appear much more amenable for the purposes of numerical evaluation than the s - matrix formulation in the landau representation .",
    "this arises because effective lagrangian and proper - time ( collectively referred to by the label elp here ) methods produce results that involve triple integrals over relatively simple ( hyperbolic and exponential ) functions , while the s - matrix amplitudes integrate over the parallel momentum and include a triple summation over the landau level quantum numbers of the intermediate pair states .",
    "both techniques start from different but equivalent @xcite forms of the electron propagator , and hence s - matrix computations @xcite should yield identical results to proper - time numerics @xcite . for the specific case of magnetic pair creation ,",
    "such an equivalence of the s - matrix and proper - time methods has been demonstrated@xcite , but only via continuous asymptotic approximations that smoothly average out the exact `` sawtooth '' resonance structure .",
    "yet the s - matrix landau representation approach explicitly retains the resonances in the scattering amplitudes above pair threshold , whereas the elp methods eliminate such information early during developments .",
    "photon splitting becomes effectively first - order in at any one of a multitude of pair resonances , generated when the intermediate states become `` on - shell . ''",
    "hence it is quite possible that splitting can compete effectively with pair creation as a photon absorption mechanism above pair threshold .",
    "ascertaining whether this is true is an interesting physics question .",
    "moreover , if splitting is approximately as probable as pair creation above threshold , then it manifestly changes the character of vacuum dispersion , so that quadratic ( and by inference perhaps higher order ) contributions to the vacuum polarization tensor become significant relative to the standard linear ones used in the derivation @xcite of kinematic selection rules for splitting .",
    "hence , the generation of exact and compact expressions for the rates for valid both below and above pair creation threshold is clearly a worthwhile enterprise from a physics perspective .",
    "developed expressions for the rates for photon splitting are also important for astrophysical applications of this process , particularly to effect efficient and accurate computations of such rates .",
    "these applications have so far focused on neutron star magnetospheres , primarily on models of soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and strongly - magnetized pulsars , both being extremely topical in the astrophysics community at present .",
    "the potential importance of splitting in neutron star environments was suggested by @xcite .",
    "possible formation of splitting cascades has been explored in models of sgr transient outbursts as a means of softening the spectrum efficiently with no production of pairs @xcite .",
    "if both polarizations can split , or if polarization switching is active during sgr outbursts , then the properties of the splitting cross - section guarantee emergent spectra in the observed range ( 20150 kev ) and of the observed shape for all fields in excess of around gauss @xcite , provided that the emission region is not concentrated near the polar cap .",
    "the spectral properties of sgrs in quiescent emission appear to be distinct from those during outburst .",
    "pulsations and temporal increases of their periods ( i.e. spin - down ) have now been observed @xcite for two of the four confirmed sgrs ( sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 ) , leading to inferences of fields in the vicinity of gauss .",
    "the connection between these pulsars of extremely high magnetization , so - called _ magnetars _ , and conventional radio / x - ray / gamma - ray pulsars is not well - understood .",
    "baring & harding @xcite postulated that radio quiescence , a property of the sgrs , may be common in magnetars due to the efficient action of photon splitting and other effects in suppressing the creation of pairs .",
    "photon splitting also has spectral implications for such pulsars with more modest fields : @xcite demonstrated that the unusual absence of mev emission in the gamma - ray pulsar psr 1509 - 58 ( whose spin - down field is gauss ) can naturally be explained by the operation of in the intense magnetic and gravitational fields near its surface .",
    "several desirable goals are immediately identifiable on the basis of this historical path for the study of the physics of photon splitting , and the needs of the astrophysics community . it would be satisfying ( i ) to obtain analytic expressions for rates that are valid above pair creation threshold using the landau representation methodology , ( ii ) to know whether the analytic formalism of mentzel et al .",
    "@xcite can be developed and simplified , and ( iii ) to demonstrate a formal equivalence between this s - matrix landau representation approach and extant results from proper - time / effective lagrangian techniques .",
    "this paper addresses these issues , using the verified analytic formalism of mentzel et al . as the starting point for mathematical developments .",
    "the analysis here considers all the polarization modes that are permitted by the cp invariance symmetry ( , and ) , and applies for collinear momenta of the incoming and outgoing photons , i.e. when the effects of vacuum dispersion are neglected . a significant development provided in this paper is the dramatic simplification incurred by algebraically performing the summation over the spin states that are incorporated in the electron propagators .",
    "the resulting expressions in section  [ sec : reduce ] ( first stated in @xcite ) are relatively compact , and of an appearance familiar to landau representation / s - matrix theory applications to magnetized environments ( i.e. including associated laguerre functions ) .",
    "furthermore , here the integrations over the momentum parallel to the field are performed analytically for the first time in section  [ sec : pzint ] , rendering the splitting rates in most amenable forms ( see eqs .  [",
    "[ eq : totratefin ] ] and [ [ eq : mform ] ] ) that are optimal for numerical applications : the analytic forms presented consist of just triple summations over landau level quantum numbers of the intermediate states . these general results are valid both below and above pair threshold at non - resonant photon energies , and provide substantial advances over the work of @xcite ; they are much more suitable for numerical evaluation since many cancellations have been eliminated algebraically .",
    "two specializations are discussed in section  [ sec : limits ] , primarily to ( partially ) demonstrate equivalence of the landau representation formalism presented here with extant proper - time / effective lagrangian limiting forms for splitting rates , and simultaneously to serve as a check on the mathematical manipulations of this paper .",
    "results are presented for all three polarization modes permitted by cp invariance in the limit of zero dispersion .",
    "the first asymptotic regime is ( see section  [ sec : bgg1 ] ) for highly supercritical fields , , where in the case of , the limit was found to concur with a recent analytic result that was obtained by baier et al .",
    "@xcite , while new results were obtained for the other two modes . in the second specialization , in section  [ sec : omegall1 ] ,",
    "asymptotic results for energies well below pair creation threshold were obtained , reproducing the cubic energy dependence of the amplitudes obtained by other qed techniques . moreover ,",
    "new and compact expressions for the scattering amplitudes in this low energy limit are derived in terms of the logarithm of the gamma function , its integral and their derivatives .",
    "these simplified forms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mperptoparparwll1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : mperptoperpperpwll1 ] ) are also produced from extant integral forms for splitting matrix elements derived first in @xcite , thereby facilitating the first analytic demonstration of the equivalence of splitting rates obtained by the s - matrix formulation in the landau representation and those derived using schwinger - type techniques .",
    "the rates for photon splitting within an s - matrix formulation can be developed using a variety of conventions ; here the landau representation used by mentzel , berg and wunner @xcite is adopted , and formal developments lead to an independent confirmation of their analytic derivation .",
    "specifically , for a field * b * , this approach uses a representation of the electron / positron wavefunctions as eigenstates of the magnetic moment ( or spin ) operator ( with ) in cartesian coordinates within the confines of the landau gauge .",
    "such states turn out to be very convenient because they generate useful symmetry properties ; they were identified by sokolov and ternov @xcite , who dubbed them states of `` transverse polarization . ''",
    "let , and denote the polarizations of the initial and final ( primed ) photons ( ) , and , and denote the absorbed and produced photon four momenta .",
    "then the total rate for splitting via the polarization mode can be written , using eqs .",
    "( 27)(29 ) of @xcite , in terms of the s - matrix element , which is the sum of six terms corresponding to the six viable time - ordering possibilities : @xmath1 where and denote the volume and time associated with the interaction calculation and the factor of out the front avoids double counting of the final states .",
    "the priming convention adopted throughout the paper is one and two primes for the produced photons and no prime for the initial photon .",
    "since the s - matrix element contains a delta function prescribing four - momentum conservation for splitting , it is squared in the usual way using .",
    "note that the s - matrix element should possess a cubic dependence on photon energies when well below pair creation threshold , due to parity symmetry , photon gauge invariance , and the antisymmetric nature of the electromagnetic field tensor ; details are discussed in @xcite .    before writing down expressions for the s - matrix element terms ,",
    "it is appropriate to identify the dimensionless convention that shall be adopted throughout this paper . since the electron rest mass is the only mass that enters into this qed problem , we opt to scale all energies by and momenta by unless otherwise specified .",
    "this includes a scaling of for photon frequencies . in the spirit of this convention",
    ", we choose to use the symbol to represent dimensionless electron energies and reserve ( ) to denote `` dimensional '' energies as in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field will be expressed in terms of the quantum critical field hereafter , so that denotes a field of gauss .",
    "the convention for polarizations is identical to that assumed in @xcite , who opted for real polarization vectors with zero time components .",
    "the polarization states and are defined according to whether the photon s electric vector lies either perpendicular or parallel ( respectively ) to the plane containing the photon s momentum and the ( uniform ) magnetic field * b * vectors , the convention of @xcite . in the limit of zero dispersion ,",
    "three polarization modes are permitted by charge / parity ( cp ) invariance in qed , namely , and .",
    "however , adler @xcite showed ( see also @xcite ) that for weak vacuum dispersion ( roughly delineated by ) , where the refractive indices for the polarization states are very close to unity , energy and momentum could simultaneously be conserved only for the splitting mode .",
    "this kinematic selection rule applies to gamma - ray pulsar magnetospheres where plasma dispersion is negligible . in magnetar models of soft gamma repeaters , where supercritical fields are employed",
    ", strong vacuum dispersion arises .",
    "in such a regime , it is not clear whether adler s selection rules still endure , since his linear dispersion analysis omits higher order ( quadratic ) contributions @xcite to the vacuum polarization tensor ( e.g. those that couple to photon absorption via splitting ) that may become significant in supercritical fields .",
    "furthermore , plasma dispersion effects , which can nullify the vacuum selection rules , may be quite pertinent @xcite to soft gamma repeater magnetospheres , rendering them distinctly different from those of conventional pulsars .",
    "therefore , in the interests of generality , consideration of all three cp - permitted splitting modes is adopted throughout this paper .",
    "the derivation of the s - matrix element proceeds along lines identical to those in mentzel , berg & wunner @xcite , with the result being an exact reproduction of their analytic formalism , as reported in weise , baring & melrose @xcite ; for details , one is referred to @xcite .",
