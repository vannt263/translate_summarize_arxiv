    "<S> we propose a method to create `` spin cat states '' , i.e. macroscopic superpositions of coherent spin states , in bose - einstein condensates using the kerr nonlinearity due to atomic collisions . based on a detailed study of atom loss , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that cat sizes of hundreds of atoms should be realistic . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the spin cat states can be demonstrated by optical readout . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also includes the effects of higher - order nonlinearities , atom number fluctuations , and limited readout efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> great efforts are currently made in many areas to bring quantum effects such as superposition and entanglement to the macroscopic level @xcite . a particularly dramatic class of macroscopic superposition states </S>",
    "<S> are so - called cat states , i.e. superpositions of coherent states where the distance between the two components in phase space can be much greater than their individual size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the recent experiment of @xcite created a cat state of over one hundred microwave photons in a waveguide cavity coupled to a superconducting qubit . </S>",
    "<S> it was essential for the success of the latter experiment that the loss in that system is extremely small , since even the loss of a single particle from a cat state of this size will lead to almost complete decoherence .    </S>",
    "<S> here we show that it should be possible to create cat states involving the spins of hundreds of atoms in another system where particle losses can be greatly suppressed , namely , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , where the spins correspond to different hyperfine states . </S>",
    "<S> we use the kerr nonlinearity due to atomic collisions , which also played a key role in recent demonstrations of atomic spin squeezing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous proposals @xcite we do not make use of josephson couplings to create the cat state , but rely purely on the kerr nonlinearity in the spirit of the well - known optical proposal of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach is inspired by the experiment of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which stored light in a bec for over a second . ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed to use collision - based interactions in this system to implement photon - photon gates , see also ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we apply a similar approach to the creation and optical detection of spin cat states . because of the great sensitivity of these states </S>",
    "<S> , this requires a careful analysis of atom loss . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical treatment goes beyond that of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which was based on the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) . </S>",
    "<S> our new approach allows us to study several key imperfections in addition to loss , including higher - order nonlinearities , atom number fluctuations , and inefficient readout , and we conclude that their effects should be manageable .     </S>",

    "<S> note that @xmath23 is an excellent approximation of a css @xcite @xmath24 in the limit of @xmath25 which is the case in this scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> the described absorption process should prepare the two - component bec in its motional ground state to avoid the complication of unnecessary dynamics such as oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by matching the shape of the input pulse to the ground state of the effective trapping potential for the small component @xcite , provided that the effective trap is not too steep . </S>",
    "<S> once the light has been absorbed , the trapping frequency @xmath26 is then increased adiabatically independently of @xmath27 , which can be achieved by combining optical and magnetic trapping . in the regime @xmath28 , a narrow wavefunction @xmath20 is formed at the center and its density can exceed the large component a , see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the problem is thus reduced to the computation of the ground state energy @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the system can be calculated by the following mean - field energy functional @xmath35 $ ] : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the kinetic energy , potential energy , intra- and inter - component interaction energy respectively , given by @xmath41 , @xmath42 with spherically symmetric trapping @xmath43 , and @xmath44 with interaction strength @xmath45 . here </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : light - to - spin - state ] ) , the nonlinearity in @xmath53 can be obtained by the expansion of the energy @xmath54 around @xmath55 as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 generates a global phase and @xmath58 with chemical potential @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the energy to remove one atom from @xmath10 and add one atom to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 generates a simple rotation in phase space @xmath62 , which can be eliminated by a frame rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath63 is the kerr nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain these coefficients by fitting the total energy @xmath34 with @xmath64 $ ] up to fourth orders in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : energy - expansion ] ) , where the numerical ground state @xmath65 of gpe used in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : total - energy ] ) is found by the imaginary time method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this numerical approach is better than ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite because we can avoid the problems associated with the tfa of high densities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , the high density for the small component at the center limits the negative effect of quantum fluctuations in the large component @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are less important than the classical fluctuations in @xmath66 due to uncertainty in @xmath9 , whose effects will be discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can now study the effects of higher - order nonlinearities ( in particular @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) .     </S>",

    "<S> [ cap : na - loss - phase ] shows our results for the spin cat creation time @xmath33 and achievable cat size @xmath77 , taking into account the effects of atom loss . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the cat time @xmath5 decreases significantly as the trapping strength @xmath26 increases . </S>",
    "<S> note that the kerr effect disappears ( @xmath91 ) around @xmath92hz , which may be used for long term storage . as mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , the reason for the strong kerr effect for large @xmath26 is that strong trapping potential forces @xmath20 into a highly localized gaussian @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of @xmath20 is of the order of the characteristic length @xmath94 , and the density @xmath95 is peaked at the center @xmath96 which can be much higher than @xmath97 in our regime , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cap : scheme - illustration]d . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the system can be effectively described by @xmath98 , and the second order term is approximately @xmath99 , which is consistent with the first order perturbation theory in the supplemental materials @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase between the two components of the spin cat state is flipped by losing just one atom ( see the supplemental materials @xcite for more details on the effects of atom loss ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath5 must be smaller than the time to lose one atom @xmath70 , which depends on the density and thus @xmath77 . in our scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the loss of atoms in component @xmath21 will not affect the cat states directly , so we focus on the loss of component @xmath22 only , which can be estimated by the following loss rate equation @xcite : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the approximate time to lose one atom through all possible loss channels if @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the loss rates @xmath103 correspond to the loss through @xmath50-body collisions involving particles in component b , where @xmath104 is due to collisions with the background gas , @xmath105 is due to spin exchange collisions , and @xmath106 is due to three - body recombination @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the two - particle loss can be eliminated by certain choices of internal states and control methods such as applying a microwave field in @xcite , or a specific magnetic field as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter example motivates our choice of parameters in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cap : na - loss - phase ] .    fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cap : na - loss - phase]a shows the time to lose one atom through different channels : @xmath107 for one - body loss and @xmath108 for three - body loss with different combination of collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it can be observed that the high @xmath0 regime is dominated by the loss of @xmath109 , which corresponds to @xmath110 . for even larger values of @xmath26 than those shown in the figure , the three - body loss time @xmath110 becomes shorter than @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the small @xmath0 regime is dominated by the effect of @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> see the supplemental materials @xcite for an approximate analytical treatment of atom loss . </S>",
    "<S> the desirable region for experiments is @xmath78 which also depends on @xmath77 . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) furthermore includes @xmath116 photon retrieval loss , which moves the peaks towards the origin , and @xmath117 uncertainty in the total atom number , which spreads the peaks in the angular direction.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we now discuss how the existence of the spin cat states can be demonstrated via optical readout , see also fig . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ) . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the readout process starts by reducing the trapping frequency adiabatically to its initial value . </S>",
    "<S> then the spin state @xmath118 is reconverted into a state of light @xmath119 , followed by homodyne detection on the output light . using optical homodyne tomography @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we can reconstruct the husimi q - function @xcite @xmath120 with the density matrix @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> the q - function allows us to visualize the resulting spin states of bec as a function of time .    </S>",
    "<S> higher - order nonlinearities distort the cat state and shift the cat creation time from @xmath8 for a pure kerr nonlinearity to a different observed value @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cap : q - results](a ) shows @xmath123 for @xmath112hz including up to fourth - order nonlinear terms @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> two peaks at @xmath125 can be identified clearly . at the revival time @xmath126 , </S>",
    "<S> a single peak is recovered , which proves the existence of spin cat states in the bec at @xmath127 , as described in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cap : scheme - illustration](g ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the definition of @xmath127 used is the time at which the q - function shows the two highest peaks . </S>",
    "<S> in general , @xmath128 and hence @xmath129 for @xmath130 since @xmath20 is less localized than @xmath131 due to the repulsive self - interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for the weakly phase separated regime ( @xmath132 ) used in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cap : na - loss - phase ] , the effective compression from component a on @xmath20 can have the reverse effect . </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath133 and thus nearly perfect cat states at @xmath134 hz . </S>",
    "<S> further higher - order effects are shown in the supplemental materials @xcite .    in current experiments </S>",
    "<S> the light storage and retrieval process involves significant photon loss , e.g. about 90% loss in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its main effect is to move the peaks towards the origin , see fig . 3b and supplemental materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one important requirement for achieving high absorption and emission efficiency is high optical depth . </S>",
    "<S> for the example of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cap : na - loss - phase ] , the optical depth can be estimated as @xmath135 with @xmath136 , wavelength @xmath137 nm and the bec radius @xmath138 m . </S>",
    "<S> this is in principle sufficient to achieve an overall efficiency close to 1 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another important experimental imperfection is the fact that the total atom number @xmath9 can not be precisely controlled from shot to shot . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to fluctuations in the nonlinear coefficients @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> the most important negative effect of these fluctuations is dephasing , i.e. angular spreading of the peaks in fig . 3 in phase space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the angular spread at the time @xmath69 of the cat state creation can be estimated as @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the uncertainty in @xmath9 , as discussed in more detail in the supplemental materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sensitivity of our scheme to atom number fluctuations is minimized for @xmath141hz . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b shows that a 5% uncertainty in @xmath9 can be tolerated for @xmath142 hz ( even when occurring in combination with 90 % photon loss ) .    </S>",
    "<S> two key ingredients for the success of the present scheme are the use of a high trapping frequency for the small component and the achievement of very low loss . </S>",
    "<S> the high trapping frequency enhances the strength of the kerr nonlinearity , making it possible to create cat states without relying on a feshbach resonance as proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible to avoid the substantial atom loss typically associated with these resonances @xcite , and also allows one to use the magnetic field to eliminate two - body loss , which is critical . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the loss rates for the choice of rubidium internal states discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite would only allow cat sizes of order ten atoms , see the supplemental materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the high trapping frequency also helped us to suppress the unwanted effects of higher - order nonlinearities and atom number fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> if the readout efficiency could be increased significantly , then the present scheme could also be used to create optical cat states . besides their fundamental interest , both spin cat states and optical cat states are attractive in the context of quantum metrology @xcite .    </S>",
