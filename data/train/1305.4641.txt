    "measurements of galaxy rotation curves form the foundation of much of our understanding of galaxy formation , structure , and dynamics ( e.g. , binney & merrifield 1998 ; binney & tremaine 2008 ; mo , van den bosch , & white 2010 ) . the current knowledge of galaxy rotation is based entirely on observations of doppler shifts in radiation from galaxies .",
    "this yields only one coordinate of motion , the los velocity .",
    "if a galaxy rotates , and is not viewed edge - on , it will also rotate in the plane of the sky . until now",
    ", the implied pms have generally been undetectable , given the available observational capabilities .",
    "however , the observational capabilities have steadily advanced .",
    "we present here new results for the lmc that constitute the first detailed measurement and analysis of the large - scale rotation field of any galaxy in all three dimensions .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) provides a unique combination of high spatial resolution , long - term stability , exquisite instrument calibrations , and ever - increasing time baselines . over the past decade , this has opened up the local group of galaxies to detailed pm studies .",
    "these studies have focused primarily on the satellites of the milky way ( kallivayalil et al .",
    "2006a , hereafter k06 ; kallivayalil , van der marel & alcock 2006b ; piatek & prior 2008 , and references therein ; pryor , piatek & olszewski 2010 ; lpine et al .  2011 ; sohn et al .",
    "2013 ; boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "more recently it has even become possible to go out as far as m31 ( sohn et al .",
    "2012 ; van der marel et al .",
    "2012a , b ) .",
    "all of these studies have aimed at measuring the systemic center - of - mass ( com ) motion of the target galaxies , and not their internal kinematics . so typically , only 13 different fields were observed in any given galaxy . by contrast , a study of internal kinematics requires , in addition to high pm accuracy , a larger number of different fields spread out over the face of the galaxy .",
    "in k06 we presented a detailed pm study of the lmc .",
    "we used hst to observe 21 fields centered on background quasars , in two epochs separated by a median baseline of 1.9 years .",
    "the distribution of observed fields extends to 4@xmath4 from the lmc center ( @xmath5 for an assumed distance of @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 ; freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) . from the data we derived the average pm of the stars in each field .",
    "we used this to estimate the pm of the lmc com . in besla",
    "et al .  ( 2007 ) our team studied the implied orbit of the magellanic clouds , and argued that they may be falling into the milky way for the first time .",
    "the data also allowed us to detect the pm rotation of the lmc at @xmath8 significance .",
    "the rotation sense and magnitude were found to be consistent with the detailed predictions for the lmc pm rotation field presented by van der marel et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter vdm02 ) , based on the observed los rotation field of carbon stars .    piatek et al .",
    "( 2008a , hereafter p08 ) performed a more sophisticated reanalysis of our k06 data , including small corrections for charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) losses .",
    "this yielded better pm consistency between fields , but implied a similar pm for the lmc com .",
    "p08 used their measurements to derive the first crude pm rotation curve for the lmc , assuming fixed values for the dynamical center and disk orientation .",
    "however , their inferred rotation amplitude @xmath9 appears unphysically high , exceeding the known rotation of cold hi gas ( kim et al .",
    "1998 ; olsen & massey 2007 ) by @xmath10 .",
    "so better data are needed to accurately address the pm rotation of the lmc .",
    "we recently presented a third epoch of hst pm data for 10 fields ( kallivayalil et al .",
    "2013 ; hereafter paper",
    "i ) , increasing the median time baseline to 7.1 years . for these fields we obtained a median per - coordinate pm uncertainty of only 7 km / s ( 0.03 mas / yr ) , which is a factor 34 better than in k06 and p08 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath11% of the lmc rotation amplitude .",
    "as we show in the present paper , these data are sufficient to map out the lmc pm rotation field in detail , yielding new determinations of the lmc dynamical center , disk orientation , and rotation curve .",
    "the lmc is a particularly interesting galaxy for which to perform such a study . at a distance of only @xmath12 ,",
    "it is one of nearest and best - studied galaxies next to our own milky way ( e.g. , westerlund 1997 ; van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "it is a benchmark for studies on various topics , including stellar populations and the interstellar medium , microlensing by dark objects , and the cosmological distance scale . as nearby companion of the milky way , with significant signs of interaction with the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ,",
    "the lmc is also an example of ongoing hierarchical structure formation .",
    "for all these applications it is important to have a solid understanding of the lmc structure and kinematics .",
    "the current state of knowledge about the kinematics of the lmc was reviewed recently by van der marel , kallivayalil & besla ( 2009 ) .",
    "studies of the los velocities of many different tracers have contributed to this knowledge .",
    "the kinematics of gas in the lmc has been studied primarily using hi ( e.g. , kim et al .",
    "1998 ; olsen & massey 2007 ; olsen et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter o11 ) .",
    "discrete lmc tracers which have been studied kinematically include star clusters ( e.g. , schommer et al .",
    "1992 ; grocholski et al .",
    "2006 ) , planetary nebulae ( meatheringham et al .",
    "1988 ) , hii regions ( feitzinger , schmidt - kaler & isserstedt 1977 ) , red supergiants ( prevot et al .",
    "1985 ; massey & olsen 2003 ; o11 ) , red giant branch ( rgb ) stars ( zhao et al .  2003 ; cole et al .",
    "2005 ; carrera et al .",
    "2011 ) , carbon stars and other asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. , kunkel et al .  1997 ; hardy et al .  2001",
    "; vdm02 ; olsen & massey 2007 ; o11 ) , and rr lyrae stars ( minniti et al .",
    "2003 ; borissova et al .",
    "2006 ) . for the majority of tracers ,",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is at least a factor @xmath13 smaller than their rotation velocity .",
    "this implies that on the whole the lmc is a ( kinematically cold ) disk system .",
    "specific questions that can be addressed in a new way through a study of the lmc pm rotation field include the following :    * what is the stellar dynamical center of the lmc , and does this coincide with the hi dynamical center ?",
    "it has long been known that different measures of the lmc center ( e.g. , center of the bar , center of the outer isophotes , hi dynamical center , etc . )",
    "are not spatially coincident ( e.g. , van der marel 2001 , hereafter vdm01 ; cole et al .  2005 ) , but a solid understanding of this remains lacking .",
    "* what is the orientation under which we view the lmc disk ?",
    "past determinations of the inclination angle and the line - of - nodes position angle have spanned a significant range , and the results from different studies are often not consistent within the stated uncertainties ( e.g. , van der marel et al .",
    "knowledge of the orientation angles is necessary to determine the face - on properties of the lmc , with past work indicating that the lmc is not circular in its disk plane ( vdm01 ) .",
    "* what is the pm of the lmc com , which is important for understanding the lmc orbit with respect to the milky way ?",
    "we showed in paper  i that the observational pm errors are now small enough that they are not the dominant uncertainty anymore .",
    "instead , uncertainties in our knowledge of the geometry and kinematics of the lmc disk are now the main limiting factor . *",
    "what is the rotation curve amplitude of the lmc ?",
    "previous studies that used different tracers or methods sometimes obtained inconsistent values ( e.g. , p08 ; o11 ) .",
    "the rotation curve amplitude is directly tied to the mass profile of the lmc , which is an important quantity for our understanding of the past orbital history of the lmc with respect to the milky way ( paper  i ) . * what is the distance of the lmc ?",
    "uncertainties in this distance form a key limitation in our understanding of the hubble constant ( e.g. , freedman et al .",
    "comparison of the pm rotation amplitude ( in mas / yr ) and the los rotation amplitude ( in km / s ) can in principle yield a kinematical determination of the lmc distance that bypasses the stellar evolutionary uncertainties inherent to other methods ( gould 2000 ; van der marel et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in paper  i of this series we presented our new third epoch observations ,",
    "and we analyzed all the available hst pm data for the lmc ( and the smc ) .",
    "we included a reanalysis of the earlier k06/p08 data , with appropriate corrections for cte losses .",
    "we used the data to infer an improved value for the pm and the galactocentric velocity of the lmc com , and we discussed the implications for the orbit of the magellanic clouds with respect to the milky way ( and in particular whether or not the clouds are on their first infall ) .    in the present paper",
    "we use the pm data from paper  i to study the internal kinematics of the lmc .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ s : model ] discusses the pm rotation field , including both the data and our best - fit model .",
    "section  [ s : los ] presents a new analysis of the los kinematics of lmc tracers available from the literature . by including the new constraints from the pm data , this analysis yields a full three - dimensional view of the rotation of the lmc disk .",
    "section  [ s : param ] discusses implications of the results for our understanding of the geometry , kinematics , and structure of the lmc .",
    "this includes discussions of the galaxy distance and systemic motion , the dynamical center and rotation curve , the disk orientation and limits on precession and nutation , and the galaxy mass .",
    "we also discuss how the rotation of the lmc compares to that of other galaxies .",
    "section  [ s : conc ] summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "we use the pm data presented in table  1 of paper  i as the basis of our study .",
    "the data consist of positions @xmath14 for 22 fields , with measured pms @xmath15 in the west and north directions , and corresponding pm uncertainties @xmath16 .",
    "there are 10 `` high - accuracy '' fields with long time baselines ( @xmath17 years ) and three - epochs of data , and 12 `` low - accuracy '' fields with short time baselines ( @xmath13 years ) and two - epochs of data .",
    "the pm measurement for each field represents the average pm of @xmath18 lmc stars with respect to one known background quasar .",
    "the number of well - measured lmc stars varies by field , but is in the range 8129 , which a median @xmath19 .",
    "the field size for each pm measurement corresponds to the footprint of the hst acs / hrc camera , which is @xmath20 arcmin .",
    "this is negligible compared to the size of the lmc itself , which extends to a radius of @xmath21@xmath22 ( vdm01 ; saha et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : obsvar ] illustrates the data , by showing the spatially variable component of the observed pm field , @xmath23 , where the constant vector @xmath24 mas / yr . this vector is the best - fit pm of the lmc com as derived later in the present paper , and as discussed in paper  i. clockwise motion is clearly evident .",
    "the goal of the subsequent analysis is to model this motion to derive relevant kinematical and geometrical parameters for the lmc .",
    "= 0.8      to interpret the lmc pm observations one needs a model for the pm vector @xmath25 as a function of position on the sky .",
    "the pm model can be expressed as a function of equatorial coordinates , @xmath26 , or as a function of polar coordinates , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the angular distance from the lmc com and @xmath29 is the corresponding position angle measured from north over east .",
    "generally speaking , the model can be written as a sum of two vectors , @xmath30 , representing the contributions from the systemic motion of the lmc com and from the internal rotation of the lmc , respectively .",
    "consider first the contribution from the systemic motion .",
    "the three - dimensional velocity that determines how the lmc com moves through space is a fixed vector .",
    "however , the projection of this vector onto the west and north directions depends on where one looks in the lmc .",
    "this introduces an important spatial variation in the pm field , due to several different effects , including : ( i ) only a fraction @xmath31 of the lmc transverse velocity is seen in the pm direction ; ( ii ) a fraction @xmath32 of the lmc los velocity is also seen in the pm direction ; and ( iii ) the directions of west and north are not fixed in a zenithal projection centered on the lmc , due to the deviation of @xmath14 contours from an orthogonal grid near the south galactic pole ( see figure  4 of van der marel & cioni 2001 , hereafter vdmc01 ) . as a result , one can write @xmath33 . the first term is the constant pm of the lmc com , measured at the position of the com .",
    "the second term is the spatially varying component of the systemic contribution , which can be referred to as the `` viewing perspective '' component .    to describe the component of internal rotation , we assume that the lmc is a flat disk with circular streamlines .",
    "this is the same approach that has been used successfully to model los velocities in the lmc ( e.g. , vdm02 ; o11 ) .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that this model is only approximately correct .",
    "the lmc is not circular in its disk plane ( vdm01 ) ,",
    "so the streamlines are not expected to be exactly circular .",
    "fortunately , the gravitational potential is always rounder than the density distribution , so circular streamlines should give a reasonable low - order approximation .",
    "also , the modest @xmath34 of the lmc indicates that its disk is not particularly thin ( vdm02 ) .",
    "so the flat - disk model should be viewed as an approximation to the actual ( three - dimensional ) velocity field as projected onto the disk plane .    at any point in the disk ,",
    "the relation between the transverse velocity @xmath35 in km / s and the pm @xmath36 in mas / yr is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the distance in kpc .",
    "the distance @xmath38 is not the same for all fields , and is not the same as the distance @xmath39 of the lmc com .",
    "the lmc is an inclined disk , so one side of the lmc is closer to use than the other .",
    "this has been quantified explicitly by comparing the relative brightness of stars on opposite sides of the lmc ( e.g. , vdmc01 ) .",
    "the analytical expressions for the pm field thus obtained , @xmath40 were presented in vdm02 .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for the details of the spherical trigonometry and linear algebra involved .",
    "the following model parameters uniquely define the model :    * the projected position @xmath41 of the lmc com , which is also the dynamical center of the lmc s rotation . * the orientation of the lmc disk , as defined by the inclination @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 defined as face - on ) and the position angle @xmath44 of the line of nodes ( the intersection of the disk and sky planes ) , measured from north over east . *",
    "the pm of the lmc com , @xmath45 , expressed in the heliocentric frame ( i.e. , not corrected for the reflex motion of the sun ) . *",
    "the heliocentric los velocity of the lmc com , @xmath46 , expressed in angular units ( for which we use mas / yr throughout this paper ) . * the rotation curve in the disk ,",
    "@xmath47 , expressed in angular units . here",
    "@xmath48 is the radius in the disk in physical units , and @xmath49 .",
    "( along the line of nodes , @xmath50 ; in general , the lmc distance must be specified to calculate the radius in the disk is in physical units ) .",
    "the first two bullets define the geometrical properties of the lmc , and the last three bullets its kinematical properties .",
    "figures  10a , b of vdm02 illustrate the predicted morphology of the pm fields @xmath51 and @xmath52 for a specific lmc model tailored to fit the los velocity field .",
    "these two components have comparable amplitudes .",
    "the spatially variable component of the observed pm field @xmath53 in figure  [ f : obsvar ] provides an observational estimate of the sum @xmath54 ( compare eq .",
    "[ [ pmfield ] ] ) .",
    "the pm field is defined by the variation of two components of motion over the face of the lmc . by contrast , the los velocity field is defined by the variation of only one component of motion .",
    "the pm field therefore contains more information , and has more power to discriminate the parameters of the model .",
    "as we will show , important constraints can be obtained with only 22 pm measurements , ) , so the shot noise is a factor @xmath55 smaller . moreover ,",
    "his simulation had a central velocity dispersion in the disk of @xmath56 , which is higher than the value @xmath57 typical for the population that dominates the mass ( vdm02 ) .",
    "as a result , his assumed random measurement uncertainties were a factor @xmath58 too high . ] whereas los velocity studies require hundreds or thousands of stars .",
    "the following simple arguments show that knowledge of the full pm field in principle allows unique determination of all model parameters , without degeneracy .",
    "* the dynamical center @xmath41 is the position around which the spatially variable component of the pm field has a well - defined sense of rotation .",
    "* the azimuthal variation of the pm rotation field determines both of the lmc disk orientation angles @xmath59 .",
    "perpendicular to the line of nodes ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) , all of the rotational velocity @xmath61 in the disk is seen as a pm ( and none is seen along the los ) . by contrast , along the line of nodes ( i.e. , @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) , only approximately @xmath64 is seen as a pm ( and approximately @xmath65 is seen along the los ) .",
    "the near and far side of the disk are distinguished by the fact that velocities on the near side imply larger pms . *",
    "the pm of the lmc com , @xmath45 , is the pm at the dynamical center .",
    "* the systemic los velocity @xmath66 in angular units follows from the radially directed component of the pm field .",
    "a fraction @xmath67 is seen in this direction ( appearing as an `` inflow '' for @xmath68 and an `` outflow '' for @xmath69 ) .",
    "this component is almost perpendicular to the more tangentially oriented component induced by rotation in the lmc disk , so the two are not degenerate .",
    "however , the radially directed component is small near the galaxy center ( e.g. , @xmath70 for @xmath71 ) , so exquisite pm data would be required to constrain @xmath66 with meaningful accuracy . *",
    "the rotation curve @xmath47 in angular units follows from the pms along the line - of - nodes position angle @xmath44 .",

    "specifically , there is strong degeneracy between three of the model parameters ( see vdm02 ) : the rotation curve @xmath61 , the inclination angle @xmath42 ( since the observed los velocity component is approximately @xmath65 ) , and the component @xmath118 of the transverse com velocity vector @xmath119 projected onto the line of nodes ( which adds a solid - body component to the observed rotation ) . so the rotation curve can only be determined from the los velocity field if @xmath42 and @xmath118 are assumed to be known independently .",
    "typically ( e.g. , vdm02 ; o11 ) , @xmath42 has been estimated from geometric methods ( e.g. , vdmc01 ) and @xmath118 from proper motion studies ( e.g. , k06 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the transverse com velocity component @xmath120 in the direction perpendicular to the line of nodes _ is _ determined uniquely by the los velocity field , as is the position angle @xmath44 of the line of nodes itself .",
    "and of course , the systemic los velocity @xmath94 is determined much more accurately by the los velocity field than by the pm field .",
    "an important difference between the two observationally accessible fields is that the pm field constrains velocities in angular units ( mas / yr ) , whereas the los velocity field constrains the same velocities in physical units ( km / s ) .",
    "hence , comparison of the results for e.g. @xmath61 or @xmath120 from the two fields constrains the lmc distance @xmath39 .",
    "this is discussed further in section  [ ss : dist ] .      in our earlier analysis of k06",
    ", we treated @xmath45 as the only free parameters to be determined from the pm data .",
    "all other quantities were kept fixed to estimates previously obtained either by vdm02 from a study of the lmc los velocity field , by vdmc01 from a study of the lmc orientation angles , or by freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from a study of the lmc distance .",
    "p08 took the same approach , but as discussed in section  [ s : intro ] , they did treat the rotation curve @xmath61 as a free function to be determined from the data . keeping model parameters fixed a priori is reasonable when only limited data is available .",
    "however , this does have several undesirable consequences .",
    "first , it does not use the full information content of the pm data , which actually constrains the parameters independently .",
    "second , it opens the possibility that parameters are used that are not actually consistent with the pm data . and",
    "third , it leads to underestimates of the errorbars on the lmc com pm @xmath45 , since the uncertainties in the geometry and rotation of the lmc are not propagated into the answers ( as discussed in paper  i ) .    the three - epoch pm data presented in paper  i have much improved quality over the two - epoch measurements presented by k06a and p08 , as evident from figure  [ f : obsvar ] .",
    "we therefore now treat all of the key parameters that determine the geometry and kinematics of the lmc as free parameters to be determined from the data .",
    "there are @xmath121 lmc fields , and hence @xmath122 observed quantities ( there are two pm coordinates per field ) . by comparison",
    ", the model is defined by the 7 parameters @xmath123 and the one - dimensional function @xmath47 .",
    "the rotation curves of galaxies follow well - defined patterns , and are therefore easily parameterized with a small number of parameters .",

    "this corresponds to a rotation curve that rises linearly to velocity @xmath125 at radius @xmath126 , and stays flat beyond that .",
    "the quantity @xmath127 is the rotation amplitude expressed in angular units . later in section  [ ss : rotcurve ]",
    "we also present unparameterized estimates of the rotation curve @xmath61 . sticking with the parameterized form for now , we have an overdetermined problem with more data points ( @xmath128 ) than model parameters ( @xmath129 ) , so this is a well - posed mathematical problem .",
    "we also know from the discussion in section  [ ss : pmvslos ] that the model parameters should be uniquely defined by the data without degeneracy .",

    "table  [ t : param ] lists the parameters of the best - fit model and their uncertainties .",
    "these parameters are discussed in detail in section  [ s : param ] .",
    "figure  [ f : obsrot ] shows the data - model comparison for the best fit . for this figure",
    ", we subtracted the systemic velocity contribution @xmath165 implied by the best - fit model , from both the observations and the model .",
    "by contrast to figure  [ f : obsvar ] , this now also subtracts the spatially - varying viewing perspective .",
    "so the observed rotation component @xmath166 is compared to the model component @xmath167 .",
    "clockwise motion is clearly evident in the observations , and this is reproduced by the model .",
    "the best - fit model has @xmath168 for @xmath169 . hence , @xmath170 .",
    "so even though the model captures the essence of the observations , it is not formally statistically consistent with it",
    ". there are three possible explanations for this .",
    "first , the observations could be affected by unidentified low - level systematics in the data analysis , in addition to the well - quantified random uncertainties .",
    "second , shot noise from the finite number of stars may be important for some fields with low @xmath18 , causing the mean pm of the observed stars to deviate from the true mean motion in the lmc disk . and third",
    ", the model may be too over - simplified ( e.g. , if there are warps in the disk , or if the streamlines in the lmc disk deviate from circles at a level comparable to our measurement uncertainties ) .",
    "it is difficult to establish which explanation may be correct , and the explanation may be different for different fields .",
    "two of our hst fields are close to each other at a separation of only @xmath171 , and this provides some additional insight into potential sources of error .",
    "the fields , labeled l12 and l14 in table  1 of paper  i , are located at @xmath172 and @xmath173 ( see figure  [ f : obsvar ] ) . since the fields are so close to each other , the best - fit model predicts that the pms should be similar , @xmath174 mas / yr . however ,",
    "the observations differ by @xmath175 mas / yr .",
    "this level of disagreement can in principle happen by chance ( 9% probability ) , but maybe a possible additional source of error is to blame .",
    "the disagreement in this case can not arise because the model is too oversimplified , since almost any model would predict that closely - separated fields in the disk have similar pms .",
    "also , shot noise is too small to explain the difference .",
    "these fields had @xmath17618 stars measured , and a typical velocity dispersion in the disk is @xmath177 ( vdm02 ) .",
    "this implies a shot noise error ( per coordinate , per field ) of only @xmath178 mas / yr , which is below the random errors for these fields .",
    "these fields have lower @xmath18 and smaller random errors than most other fields , so this means that shot noise in general plays at most a small role .",
    "so in the case of these fields , and maybe for the sample as a whole , it is likely that we are dealing with unidentified low - level systematics in the data analysis .    either way , the exact cause why @xmath179 does not matter much , since in the monte - carlo analysis of pseudo - data we multiply all observational errors by @xmath151 .",
    "so the actual residuals in the data - model comparison are accounted for when calculating the uncertainties in the model parameters .",
    "moreover , the astrometric observations presented in paper  i are extremely challenging .",
    "so the level of agreement in the data - model comparison of figure  [ f : obsrot ] is actually extremely encouraging .",
    "many studies exist of the los velocity field of tracers in the lmc , as discussed in section  [ s : intro ] .",
    "two of the most sophisticated studies are those of vdm02 and o11 .",
    "the vdm02 study modeled the los velocities of @xmath180 carbon stars , and its results formed the basis of the rotation model used in k06 .",
    "the more recent o11 study obtained a rotation fit to the los velocities of @xmath181 red supergiants ( rsgs ) , and also presented @xmath182 new los velocities for other giant and agb stars .",
    "the parameters of the vdm02 and o11 rotation models are presented in table  [ t : paramlit ] .",
    "comparison of the vdm02 and o11 parameters to those obtained from our pm field fit in table  [ t : param ] shows a few important differences .",
    "the com pm values used by both vdm02 and o11 are inconsistent with our most recent estimate from paper  i. this is important , because the transverse motion of the lmc introduces a solid body rotation component into the lmc los velocity field , which must be corrected to model the internal lmc rotation .",
    "also , the dynamical centers either inferred ( vdm02 ) or used ( o11 ) by the past los velocity studies are in conflict with the dynamical center implied by the new pm analysis . these differences are discussed in detail in section  [ s : param ] .",
    "motivated by these differences , we decided to perform a new analysis of the available los velocity data from the literature , taking into account the new pm results .",
    "this yields a full three - dimensional view of the rotation of the lmc disk .",
    "= 0.8      it is well - known that the kinematics of stars in the lmc depends on the age of the population , as it does in the milky way .",
    "young populations have small velocity dispersions , and high rotation velocities .",
    "by contrast , old populations have higher velocity dispersions ( e.g. , van der marel et al .  2009 ) , and lower rotation velocities ( see table  [ s : param ] ) due to asymmetric drift .",
    "for this reason , we compiled two separate samples from the literature for the present analysis : a `` young '' sample and an `` old '' sample .",
    "the young sample is composed of rsgs , which is the youngest stellar population for which detailed accurate kinematical data exist .",
    "the old sample is composed of a mix of carbon stars , agb stars , and rgb stars .    for our young sample , we combined the rsg velocities of prevot et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , massey & olsen ( 2003 ) , and o11 ( adopting the classification from their figure  1 ) .",
    "for the old sample , we combined the carbon star velocities of kunkel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , hardy et al .",

    "( 2011 ) .",
    "when a star is found in more than one dataset , we retained only one of the multiple velocity measurements . if a measurement existed from o11 , we retained that , because the o11 data set is the largest and most homogeneous dataset available . otherwise we retained the measurement from the data set with the smallest random errors .",
    "stars with non - conforming velocities were rejected iteratively using outlier rejection .",
    "for the young and old samples we rejected stars with velocities that differ by more than @xmath184 and @xmath185 from the best - fit rotation models , respectively . in each case",
    "this corresponds to residuals @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the los velocity dispersion of the sample .",
    "the outlier rejection removes both foreground milky way stars , as well as stripped smc stars that are seen in the direction of the lmc ( estimated by o11 as @xmath188% of their sample ) .",
    "all samples were brought to a common velocity scale by applying additive velocity corrections to the data for each sample . these were generally small ; massey & olsen ( 2003 ) : @xmath189 ; kunkel et al .",

    "we adopted the absolute velocity scale of o11 as the reference .",
    "since they observed both young and old stars in the same fields with the same setup , this ties together the velocity scales of the young and old samples .",
    "to bring other samples to the o11 scale we used stars in common between the samples , and we also compared the residuals relative to a common velocity field fit .",
    "our final samples contain los velocities for 723 young stars and 6067 old stars in the lmc .",
    "figure  [ f : losobs ] shows a visual representation of the discrete velocity field defined by the stars in the combined sample . the coverage of the lmc is patchy and incomplete , as defined by the observational setups used by the various studies .",
    "the young star sample is confined almost entirely to distances @xmath198 degrees from the lmc center .",
    "this is where the old star sample has most of its measurements as well .",
    "however , a sparse sampling of old star velocities does continue all the way out to @xmath199 degrees from the lmc center .",
    "a velocity gradient is easily visible in the figure by eye .",
    "what is observed is the sum of the internal rotation of the lmc and an apparent solid - body rotation component due to the lmc s transverse motion ( vdm02 ) . the latter component contributes more as one moves further from the lmc center , which causes an apparent twisting of the velocity field with radius .      to interpret the los velocity data we use the same rotation field model for a circular disk as in section  [ ss : vmodel ] .",
    "the model is defined by the 7 parameters @xmath200 and the one - dimensional function @xmath61 , which we parameterize with the two parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 as in equation  ( [ rotparam ] ) .",
    "note that the los velocity field depends on the physical velocities @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath94 , and @xmath61 , unlike the pm field , which depends on the angular velocities @xmath86 , @xmath90 , @xmath66 , and @xmath47 .",
    "as before , the model can be written as a sum of two terms , @xmath203 , representing the contributions from the systemic motion of the lmc com and from the internal rotation of the lmc , respectively .",
    "the analytical expressions for the los velocity field @xmath204 thus obtained were presented in vdm02 .",
    "as before , we refer the reader to that paper for the details of the spherical trigonometry and linear algebra involved .    in section  [ s : model ] we have fit the pm data by themselves , and in other studies such as vdm02 and o11 , the los data have been fit by themselves .",
    "these approaches require that some systemic velocity components ( @xmath94 for the pm field analysis , and @xmath45 for the los velocity field analysis ) must be fixed a priori to literature values .",
    "but clearly , the best way to use the full information content of the data is to fit the pm and los data _",
    "simultaneously_. this is therefore the approach we take here .    to fit the combined data , we define a @xmath130 quantity @xmath205 the quantity @xmath133",
    "is as defined in equation  ( [ chisqpm ] ) .",
    "the observational pm errors are adjusted as in section  [ ss : compare ] so that the best fit to the pm data by themselves yields @xmath206 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath207 ^ 2 , \\label{chisqlos}\\ ] ] which sums the squared residuals over all @xmath18 los velocities . here",
    "@xmath208 is a measure of the observed los velocity dispersion of the sample , which we assume to be a constant for each los velocity sample .",
    "we set @xmath208 to be the rms scatter around the best - fit model that is obtained when the los data are fit by themselves ( this yields @xmath209 , analogous to the case for @xmath133 ) .",
    "= 0.8    this approach yields that @xmath210 for the young sample , and @xmath211 for the old sample .",
    "this confirms , as expected , that the older stars have a larger velocity dispersion .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with previous work ( e.g. , vdm02 ; olsen & massey 2007 ) .",
    "note that @xmath212 represents a quadrature sum of the intrinsic velocity dispersion @xmath213 of the stars and the typical observational measurement error @xmath214 .",
    "for all the data used here , @xmath215 , so it is justified to not include the individual measurement errors @xmath216 explicitly in the definition of @xmath217 .",
    "as before , we minimize @xmath130 as function of the model parameters using a down - hill simplex routine ( press et al .  1992 ) , with multiple iterations and checks built in to ensure that a global minimum is found .",
    "we calculate error bars on the best - fit model parameters using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the pseudo pm data for this are generated as in section  [ ss : method ] .",
    "the pseudo los velocity data are obtained by drawing new velocities for the observed stars . for this",
    "we use the predictions of the best - fit model , to which we add random gaussian deviates that have the same scatter around the fit as the observed velocities .    in minimizing @xmath130",
    ", we treat all model parameters as free parameters that are used to optimize the fit . however , we keep the distance fixed at @xmath162 ( freedman et al .  2001 ) . the uncertainty @xmath218 is accounted for by including it in the monte - carlo simulations that determine the uncertainties on the best - fit parameters .",
    "as discussed later in section  [ ss : dist ] , the combination of pm and los data does constrain the distance independently . however",
    ", this does not ( yet ) yield higher accuracy than conventional methods .    the stars for which we have measured pms form essentially a magnitude limited sample , composed of a mix of young and old stars .",
    "this mix is expected to have a different rotation velocity than a sample composed entirely of young or old stars .",
    "for this reason , we allow the rotation amplitude @xmath102 in the pm field model to be different from the rotation amplitude @xmath106 in the velocity field model .",
    "both amplitudes are varied independently to determine the best - fit model .",
    "however , we do require the scale length @xmath126 of the rotation curve and also the parameters that determine the orientation and dynamical center of the disk to be the same for the pm and los models .    with this methodology",
    ", we do two separate fits .",
    "the first fit is to the combination of the pm data and the young los velocity sample , and the second fit is to the combination of the pm data and the old los velocity sample .",
    "this has the advantage ( compared to a single fit to all the data , with only a different rotation amplitude for each sample ) of providing two distinct answers .",
    "comparison of the results then provides insight into both the systematic accuracy of the methodology , and potential differences in geometrical or kinematical properties between different stellar populations .",
    "table  [ t : param ] lists the parameters of the best - fit model and their uncertainties .",
    "the quality of the model fits to the pm data is similar to what was shown already in figure  [ f : obsrot ] for fits that did not include any los velocity constraints .",
    "a data - model comparison for the fits to the los velocity data is shown in figure  [ f : obslos ] .",
    "the fits are adequate .",
    "it is clear that the young stars rotate more rapidly than the old stars , and have a smaller los velocity dispersion .",
    "the continued increase in the observed rotation amplitude with radius is due to the solid - body rotation component in the observed velocity field that is induced by the transverse motion of the lmc .",
    "the parameters for the best fit models to the combined pm and los velocity samples can be compared to the results obtained when only the pms are fit ( table  [ t : param ] ) , or the results that have been obtained in the literature when only the los velocities were fit ( table  [ t : paramlit ] ) .",
    "this shows good agreement for some quantities , and interesting differences for others .",
    "we proceed in section  [ s : param ] by discussing the results and their comparisons in detail , and what they tell us about the lmc .",
    "= 0.8      the lmc is morphologically peculiar in its central regions , with a pronounced asymmetric bar .",
    "moreover , the light in optical images is dominated by the patchy distribution of young stars and dust extinction . as a result ,",
    "the lmc has become known as a prototype of `` irregular '' galaxies ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs & freeman 1972 ) . however , the old stars that dominate the mass of the lmc show a much more regular large - scale morphology .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f : obscontour ] , which shows the number density distribution of red giant and agb stars extracted from the 2mass survey ( vdm01 ) . despite this large - scale regularity",
    ", there does not appear to be a single well - defined center .",
    "it has long been known that different methods and tracers yield centers that are not mutually consistent , as indicated in the figure .    the densest point in the lmc bar",
    "is located asymmetrically within the bar , on the south - east side at @xmath219 ( vdm01 ; de vaucouleurs & freeman 1972 ) .. ] the center of the outer isoplets in figure  [ f : obscontour ] , corrected for the effect of viewing perspective , is at @xmath220 ( vdm01 ) .",
    "this is on the same side of the bar , but is offset by @xmath221 .",
    "by contrast , the dynamical center of the rotating hi disk of the lmc is on the opposite side of the bar , at @xmath222 ( kim et al .",
    "1998 ; luks & rohlfs 1992 ) .",
    "this is @xmath223 , i.e. , more than 1 kpc , away from the densest point in the bar ( @xmath224 at @xmath225 ) .",
    "these offsets do not pose much of a conundrum .",
    "numerical simulations have established that an asymmetric density distribution and offset bar in the lmc can be plausibly induced by tidal interactions with the smc ( e.g. , bekki et al .  2009 ; besla et al .",
    "what has been more puzzling is the position of the stellar dynamical center at @xmath226 , as determined by vdm02 from the los velocity field of carbon stars .",
    "olsen & massey ( 2007 ) independently fit the same data , and obtained a position ( and other velocity field fit parameters ) consistent with the vdm02 value .",
    "the vdm02 stellar dynamical center was adopted by subsequent studies of los velocities ( e.g. , o11 ) and pms ( k06 , p08 ) , without independently fitting it .",
    "this position is consistent with the densest point of the bar and with the center of the outer isophotes .",
    "but it is @xmath227 away from the hi dynamical center .",
    "vdm02 argued that this may be due to the fact that hi in the lmc is quite disturbed , and may be subject to non - equilibrium gas - dynamical forces .",
    "however , more recent numerical simulations in which the morphology of the lmc is highly disturbed due to interactions with the smc have shown that the dynamical centers of the gas and stars often stay closely aligned ( besla et al .  2012 ) .",
    "the best - fit stellar dynamical center from our model fit to the pm field is at @xmath228 .",
    "this _ agrees _ with the hi dynamical center ( see figure  [ f : obscontour ] ) .",
    "but it differs from the stellar dynamical center inferred by vdm02 by @xmath229 , which is inconsistent at the 99% confidence level .",
    "this is surprising , because the pm field and los velocity field are simply different projections of the three - dimensional velocity field of the stellar population .",
    "so one would expect the inferred dynamical centers to be the same .",
    "when we fit the pm data and los velocities simultaneously ( section  [ s : los ] ) , we find centers that are somewhat intermediate between between the pm - only dynamical center , and the vdm02 dynamical center ( see figure  [ f : obscontour ] ) .",
    "this is a natural outcome , as these model fits try to compromise between datasets that apparently prefer different centers .",
    "the old star sample that we use here is some six times larger than the sample used by vdm02 , and yields a center that is consistent with the young star sample used here .",
    "hence , the fact that los velocities prefer a stellar dynamical center more towards the south - east of the bar is a generic result , and does not appear to be due to some peculiarity with the carbon star sample used by vdm02",
    ". however , the dynamical centers that we infer from the combined pm and los samples are much closer to the hi dynamical center than the vdm02 dynamical center .",
    "specifically , the offsets from the hi center are @xmath230 for the old @xmath231 sample and @xmath232 for the young @xmath231 sample .",
    "such offsets occur by chance only 9% and 6% of the time , respectively .",
    "hence , they most likely signify a systematic effect and not just a chance occurrence .    in reality",
    ", it is likely that the hi and stellar dynamical centers are coincident , since both the stars and the gas orbit in the same gravitational potential .",
    "some unknown systematic effect may therefore be affecting the los velocity analyses .",
    "for example , there is good reason to believe that the true dynamical structure of the lmc is more complicated than the circular orbits in a thin plane used by our models ( e.g. , warps and twists of the disk plane have been suggested by vdmc01 , olsen & salyk 2002 , and nikolaev et al .",
    "the uncertainties thus introduced may well affect different tracers differently , leading to systematic offsets such as those reported here .",
    "visual inspection of the pm vector field in figure  [ f : obsrot ] strongly supports that the center of rotation must be close to the position identified by the pm - only model fit .",
    "for example ,",
    "the pm vectors in the central region do not have a definite sense of rotation around the position identified by vdm02 .",
    "visual inspection of the los velocity field in figure  [ f : obslos ] shows the difficulty of determining an accurate center from such data .",
    "either way , the results in table  [ t : param ] and figure  [ f : obscontour ] definitely indicate the lmc stellar dynamical center is much closer to the hi dynamical center than was previously believed .",
    "existing constraints on the orientation of the lmc disk come from two techniques .",
    "the first technique is a geometric one , based on variations in relative distance to tracers in different parts of the lmc disk ( vdmc01 ) .",
    "the second is a kinematic method , based on fitting circular orbit models to the velocity field of tracers , as we have done here .",
    "the geometric technique yields both the inclination and line - of - nodes position angle . when applied to los velocities , the kinematic technique yields only the line - of - nodes position angle , since the inclination is degenerate with the amplitude of the rotation curve .",
    "but when applied to pms , the kinematic technique yields both viewing angles ( see section  [ ss : pmvslos ] ) .",
    "existing constraints on the disk orientation obtained with these techniques were reviewed in , e.g. , van der marel ( 2006 ) and van der marel et al .",
    "some more recent results have appeared in e.g. koerwer ( 2009 ) , o11 , haschke et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , rubele et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and subramanian & subramaniam ( 2013 ) .",
    "all studies in the past decade or so agree that the inclination is in the range @xmath233@xmath234 , and that the line - of - nodes position angle is in the range @xmath235@xmath236 .",
    "the variations between the results from different studies are large , and often exceed significantly the random errors in the best - fit parameters",
    ". some of this variation may be real , and due to spatial variations in the viewing angles due to warps and twists of the disk plane , combined with differences in spatial sampling between studies , differences between different tracer populations , and contamination by possible out of plane structures ( e.g. , o11 ) .",
    "our best - fit model to the pm velocity field has @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "the implied viewing geometry of the disk is illustrated in figure  [ f : obsrot ] .",
    "the inferred orientation angles are within the range of expectation based on previous work , although they are at the high end .",
    "however , they are perfectly plausible given what is known about the lmc .",
    "this is an important validation of the accuracy of the pm data and of our modeling techniques .",
    "it is the first time that pms have been used to derive the viewing geometry of any galaxy .",
    "however , the random errors in our estimates are not sufficiently small to resolve the questions left open by past work ( apart from the fact that variations in previously reported values appear to be dominated by systematic variations , and not random errors ) .",
    "when we fit not only the pm data , but also los velocities , the best - fit viewing angles change ( table  [ t : param ] ) , in some cases by more than the random errors .",
    "however , all inferred values continue to be within the range of what has been reported in the literature . the best - fit inclination with pm data and",
    "the old star @xmath231 sample is @xmath239 , consistent e.g. with the value @xmath240 inferred geometrically by vdmc01 ( and used subsequently in the kinematical studies of vdm02 and o11 ) .",
    "the best - fit line - of - nodes position angle with the pm data and the old star @xmath231 sample is @xmath241 .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the carbon star result @xmath242 obtained by vdm02 , due primarily to the different dynamical center inferred here .    the best - fit line - of - nodes position angle with the pm data and the young star @xmath231 sample is @xmath243 .",
    "this is larger than the result @xmath244 obtained by o11 for the same @xmath231 sample , due primarily to the different dynamical center inferred here .",
    "the best - fit inclination with the pm data and the young star @xmath231 sample is @xmath245 .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than , but consistent with , the value obtained when the old star @xmath231 sample is used .",
    "however , the line - of - nodes position angles for the fits with the young and old stars differ by @xmath246 .",
    "this is an intriguing result , since the data for these samples were analyzed in identical fashion , and they do yield consistent dynamical centers .",
    "this suggests that there may be real differences in the disk geometry or kinematics for young and old stars , apart from their rotation amplitudes .",
    "indeed , the values inferred here kinematically using young stars are consistent with the values inferred geometrically for ( young ) cepheids , by nikolaev et al .",
    "they found that @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "by contrast , the values inferred here kinematically using old stars are more consistent with some sets of orientation angles that have been inferred geometrically for agb and rgb stars ( e.g. , vdmc01 ; olsen & salyk 2002 ) .",
    "all results obtained here confirm once again that the position angle of the line of nodes differs from the major axis of the projected lmc body , which is at @xmath249 .",
    "this implies that the lmc is not circular in the disk plane ( vdm01 ) .      in the best - fit model to the pm data , the final result for the lmc com pm is @xmath250 mas / yr .",
    "paper  i presented a detailed discussion of this newly inferred value , including a comparison to previous hst and ground - based measurements .",
    "there are three components that contribute to the final pm error bars , namely : ( 1 ) the random errors in the measurements of each field ; ( 2 ) the excess scatter between measurements from different fields that is not accounted for by random errors , disk rotation , and viewing perspective ; and ( 3 ) uncertainties in the geometry and dynamics of the best - fitting disk model .",
    "the contribution from the random errors can be calculated simply by calculating the error in the weighted average of all measurements .",
    "this yields @xmath251 mas / yr . this sets an absolute lower limit to how well one could do in estimating the lmc com pm from these data , if there were no other sources of error .",
    "as discussed above , the scatter between fields increases the error bars by a factor @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , @xmath253 mas / yr . since errors add in quadrature , this implies that @xmath254 mas / yr . and finally the contribution from uncertainties in geometry and dynamics of the best - fitting disk model are @xmath255 mas / yr and @xmath256 mas / yr . the final errors bars equal @xmath257 .",
    "so our knowledge of the geometry and kinematics of the lmc disk is now the main limiting factor in our understanding of the pm of the lmc com .",
    "the exact position of the lmc dynamical center is an important uncertainty in models of the lmc disk .",
    "for this reason , we explored explicitly how the fit to the pm velocity field depends on the assumed center .",
    "for example , we ran models in which the center was kept fixed to the position identified by vdm02 ( even though this center is strongly ruled out by our data ) .",
    "this changes only one of the com pm components significantly , namely @xmath90 , the lmc com pm in the north direction .",
    "its value increases by @xmath258 mas / yr when the vdm02 center is used instead of the best - fit pm center .",
    "when we use instead the centers from our combined pm and los velocity fits , then @xmath90 increases by @xmath259@xmath260 mas / yr , while again @xmath86 stays the same to within the uncertainties ( see table  [ t : param ] ) .",
    "we have found more generally that if the center is moved roughly in the direction of the position angle of the lmc bar ( pa @xmath261 ; vdm01 ) , then the implied @xmath90 changes while the implied @xmath86 is unaffected . if instead the center is moved roughly perpendicular to the bar , then @xmath86 changes while the implied @xmath90 is unaffected .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , @xmath86 affects primarily the galactocentric velocity of the lmc , while @xmath90 affects primarily the direction of the orbit as projected on the sky . in practice ,",
    "all of the centers that have been plausibly identified for the lmc align roughly along the bar ( see figure  [ f : obscontour ] ) .",
    "any remaining systematic uncertainties in the lmc center position therefore affect primarily @xmath90 , and not @xmath86 .      in our fits to the pm field we kept the parameter @xmath262",
    "mas / yr fixed to the value implied by pre - existing measurements . however , we did also run models in which it was treated as a free parameter . this yielded @xmath263 mas / yr . this is consistent with the existing knowledge , but not competitive with it in terms of accuracy .",
    "interestingly , the result does show at statistical confidence that @xmath68 .",
    "so the observed pm field in figure  [ f : obsvar ] contains enough information to demonstrate that the lmc is moving away from us .",
    "this is analogous to the situation for the los velocity field , which contains enough information to demonstrate that the lmc s transverse velocity is predominantly directed westward ( figure  8 of vdm02 ) .    in our fits of the combined pm and",
    "los velocity data , we did fit independently for the systemic los velocity . when using the old star @xmath231 sample , this yields @xmath264 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of vdm02 and olsen & massey ( 2007 ) .",
    "however , when using the young star @xmath231 sample , we obtain @xmath265 .",
    "this differs significantly both from the old star result , and from the result of o11 for the same young star sample ( table  [ t : paramlit ] ) .",
    "this is a reflection of the different centers used in the various fits , and is not due to an intrinsic offset in systemic velocity between young and old stars .",
    "when we fit the young star data with a center that is fixed to be identical to that for the old stars , we do find systemic velocities @xmath94 that are mutually consistent .        in the best - fit model to only the pm data , the rotation curve rises linearly to @xmath266 , and then stays flat at @xmath267 .",
    "at a distance modulus @xmath268 ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , this implies that @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "this rotation curve fit is shown by the black lines in figure  [ f : rotcurve ] .    to further assess the pm rotation curve",
    ", we also obtained a non - parametric estimate for it .",
    "for each hst field we already have from figure  [ f : obsrot ] the observed rotation component @xmath271 , as well as the best - fit model component @xmath272 .",
    "the model also provides the in - plane rotation velocity @xmath273 at the field location .",

    "this corresponds to modifying the model velocity by the component of the residual pm vector that projects along the local direction of rotation .",
    "similarly , the uncertainty @xmath276 is estimated as the projection of the observational pm error ellipse onto the rotation direction .",

    ", the inclination would have to be known to better than @xmath323 , not even accounting for other uncertainties .",
    "based on the discussion in section  [ ss : orient ] , it is clear that this is not currently the case , despite many papers devoted to the subject .",

    "rotation is perpendicular to the line of sight there , so that the observed velocities are due entirely to the solid - body rotation induced by the lmc s transverse motion .",
    "hence , the velocities obey @xmath324 , where @xmath28 is the distance from the com , and @xmath325 is the component of the com pm that lies along the line of nodes ( vdm02 ) .",
    "since @xmath325 is constrained by the pm data in mas / yr , the distance @xmath39 can be determined from the los data in km / s . for accurate results ,",
    "this method benefits from having data that extends to large distances @xmath28 , and from having a sample with many velocity measurements . we therefore apply it to the old star @xmath297 sample ( see figure  [ f : obslos ] ) . to use the full information content of the data , and to adequately propagate all uncertainties , one must fit the combined pm and old star @xmath231 sample with @xmath326 as a free parameter .",

    "this has a smaller random error than the result from the rotational parallax method , but is still not competitive with existing knowledge .",
    "moreover , it may be a biased estimate .",
    "when fitting @xmath326 , one should really fit @xmath44 simultaneously , because @xmath44 and @xmath326 are generally anti - correlated in our model fits .",
    "however , we found that the multi - dimensional solution space becomes more degenerate when both @xmath44 and @xmath326 are left to vary .",
    "specifically , the best fit @xmath326 can vary by @xmath329 , depending on how we choose to weight the pm data relative to the los velocity data in the @xmath130 definition ( eq .  [ [ chitot ] ] ) .",
    "so this method does not currently yield a competitive distance either .    a final method for estimating the the lmc distance from comparison of the pm and los velocity fields uses the observed systemic los velocity . as stated in section  [ ss :",

    "again , this is consistent with existing knowledge , but not competitive in terms of accuracy .",
    "the preceding analysis in this paper has assumed that the viewing angles of the lmc disk are constant with time .",
    "vdm02 showed that there are additional contributions to pm and los velocity fields when the viewing angles vary with time , i.e. , @xmath333 or @xmath334 .",

    "such motion requires external tidal torques .",
    "while it is not impossible that such motion may exist , there is no theoretical requirement that it should .",
    "the main impact of a value @xmath333 is to induce a solid - body rotation component in the los velocity field , with its steepest gradient perpendicular to the line of nodes . to assess the existence of such a component",

    "this yields @xmath336 mas / yr . this result is consistent with zero .",
    "so with the presently available data , there is no need to invoke a non - zero value of @xmath337 .",

    "however , their uncertainty is an underestimate , because it does not propagate the known uncertainties in the center , inclination , com pm , or distance .",
    "based on our analysis of the young stars , we have found no compelling reason to assume they require @xmath341 .",
    "it would in fact be difficult to understand how the spin axis of the young star disk could be moving relative to the old star disk .",

    "we have shown in section  [ sss : rotcomp ] that the amplitude inferred assuming @xmath343 agrees with the rotation amplitudes inferred from los velocities .",
    "therefore , the data do not require a value @xmath334 .",
    "if there is a deviation from zero , it would have to be small enough to not perturb the agreement discussed in section  [ sss : rotcomp ] .      to estimate the dynamical mass of the lmc , it is necessary to know the kinematics of tracers at large radii .",
    "the outermost tracers for which kinematics are available are the old stars in our @xmath344 sample ( see figure  [ f : obslos ] ) , most of which are carbon stars from kunkel et al .",
    "( 1997 ; see figure  [ f : losobs ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f : rotcurvel ] shows that the rotation curve of these stars stays more - or - less flat out the last data point , at radius @xmath345 in the disk ( see also figure  6 of vdm02 ) .",
    "since this is true for the old stars , it must be true for the young stars as well .",
    "after all , both orbit in the same gravitational potential .    based on this reasoning , we infer that the young stars have a rotation amplitude @xmath306 at @xmath345 .",
    "olsen & massey ( 2007 ) inferred a velocity dispersion for these stars of @xmath346 .",
    "the formalism of vdm02 then implies an upward asymmetric drift correction of only @xmath347 , much smaller than the random errors .",
    "this is as expected , given that o11 found that the young stars and hi gas have essentially the same rotation curve .",
    "so we obtain that @xmath348 at @xmath349 kpc , with the error dominated by inclination uncertainties .",
    "the total mass of the lmc inside the last measured data point is @xmath350 , where the gravitational constant @xmath351 .",
    "this yields @xmath352 .",
    "this is consistent with the total mass of the lmc that has been used in several past @xmath18-body simulation studies of the lmc ( e.g. , gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) .",
    "however , this is likely an underestimate of the total lmc mass .",
    "since the rotation curve is flat , the mass likely continues to rise almost linearly beyond @xmath353 .",
    "many virial masses are possible , as long as the concentration of the dark halo is varied to reproduce the dynamical mass . in paper",
    "i we considered models with virial masses up to @xmath354 .",
    "the tidal radius of the lmc can be estimated using the formalism of vdm02 .",
    "we assume that the lmc rotation curve is flat at @xmath355 , and the milky way rotation curve at the distance of the lmc is flat at @xmath356 ( based on the enclosed mass out to the lmc distance given by kochanek 1996 ) .",
    "this implies a tidal radius of @xmath2 ( i.e. , a radius on the sky of @xmath3 ) .",

    "2009 ) . in figure",
    "[ f : btf ] ( blue triangle ) we place the lmc on the baryonic tully - fisher ( btf ) , using @xmath359 from section  [ ss : mass ] and @xmath360 from vdm02 .",
    "=    mcgaugh ( 2012 ) recently calibrated the btf relation using a sample of gas - dominated low - mass systems , arguing that the errors introduced by modeling the stellar component is minimized in these gas - rich systems .",
    "these galaxies follow a very tight relation . as with high - mass galaxies",
    ", the scatter is below what is expected from initial conditions in cosmological models , implying the need for some feedback process that is correlated with the galaxy potential ( eisenstein & loeb 1996 ; mcgaugh 2012 ) .",
    "similarly , oh et al .",
    "( 2011a ) placed a sample of dwarf galaxies from the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ; walter et al .",
    "2008 ) , a high velocity - resolution hi survey of dwarf galaxies , on the btf relation . in figure",
    "[ f : btf ] , black points show gas - rich low - mass galaxies compiled in mcgaugh ( 2012 ) and pink diamonds show the things dwarfs from oh et al .",
    "( 2011a , b ) .",
    "the lmc falls on the btf relation followed by these galaxies .",
    "so even though the lmc is a member of an interacting pair , it is not atypical in terms of its btf position .",
    "as discussed in section 4.8 , the error in our @xmath361 is dominated by inclination uncertainties .",
    "so if one assumes _ a priori _ that the lmc must fall exactly on the btf , then this would in principle provide an alternative method to constrain the lmc inclination ( see also oh et al .",
    "also , central density profile slopes are a powerful probe of the properties of dark matter ( navarro , frenk , & white et al .  1997 ; dalcanton & hogan 2001 ) , and these can be constrained from observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , de blok 2010 , and references therein ; oh et al .",
    "2011a , b ) . however ,",
    "for the lmc only sparse discrete pm and los datasets are available , and these are not ideally suited for constraining the central rotation curve slope .",
    "also , the possibility of non - circular orbits in the poorly understood lmc bar region would complicate any interpretation .",
    "so we have decided not to pursue a detailed rotation curve decomposition here .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the large - scale rotation of the lmc based on observed stellar velocities in all three cartesian directions .",
    "this is the first time that such a study has been possible for any galaxy , made possible by the exquisite capabilities of hst for measuring pms in the nearby universe .",
    "while the los velocity field of the lmc has been studied previously using many tracers , our analysis of the pm rotation field is new .",
    "this is important , because the pm rotation field is defined by two components of motion , and it therefore has a higher information content than the los velocity field . as a result , quantities that are degenerate in analyses of the los velocity field ( such as the rotation curve , the inclination , and one component of the transverse motion of the com ) are uniquely determined by analysis of the pm rotation field .",
    "we interpret the data with simple models of circular rotation in a flat disk , which fit the data reasonably well . by and large , we find that the lmc rotation properties as revealed by pm and los data are mutually consistent , as they should be . however , by analyzing accurate pm data and combining it with existing los data we do obtain several new insights into the geometry , kinematics , and structure of the lmc .",
    "previous studies of the lmc have found that the photometric center is offset significantly from the dynamical center defined by the rotating hi gas disk .",
    "this is not difficult to explain , since the lmc has a lopsided off - center bar that could be a transient feature induced by the lmc s interaction with the smc .",
    "what is more puzzling has been the finding that the los velocity field of stellar tracers is best fit by a dynamical center that is _ also _ offset from the hi dynamical center .",
    "our new analysis of the pm rotation field does not confirm this .",
    "we find that the stellar dynamical center revealed by pms _ agrees _ with the hi dynamical center .",
    "however , we also find that previous analyses of the los velocity field were not in error .",
    "our new analysis of the now very large sample of available los velocity data continues to indicate a dynamical center offset , albeit by a smaller amount than reported previously .",
    "this can not be real , since the pm and los analyses observe the same stellar populations .",
    "this likely reveals limitations of the simple rotation model used . in reality",
    ", the stars and gas in the lmc probably do have the same dynamical center , because they orbit in the same gravitational potential .",
    "the best - fit values for the viewing angles that define the orientation of the lmc disk , as inferred from the pm rotation field , are within the range of values implied by previous studies . however , several puzzles remain .",
    "first , the position angle of the line of nodes @xmath44 is not the same for the young and old stellar populations of the lmc .",
    "when los velocities of the young population are fit jointly with the pm data , we obtain @xmath362 . by contrast ,",
    "when los velocities of the old population are fit jointly with the pm data , we obtain @xmath327 .",
    "when the pm data are fit by themselves , the intermediate result @xmath238 is obtained .",
    "the second puzzle is that all these kinematically determined values are larger than several results obtained from geometrical methods ( e.g. , vdmc01 , rubele et al .",
    "similarly for the inclination , the results obtained here and those discussed in the literature span a much larger range than the random errors in the individual measurements .",
    "these results can be explained if the structure of the lmc is more complicated than a single flat disk in circular rotation .",
    "indeed , the data provide indications for variations with both stellar population and radius in the disk . however , by contrast to previous authors we have found no evidence for precession or nutation of the lmc disk . given the latest insights into the position and motion of the lmc com",
    ", we find that acceptable fits to all the kinematical data can be obtained with @xmath363 and @xmath364 .",
    "the lmc rotation curve as implied by our pm measurements has an amplitude @xmath270 .",
    "this applies to a magnitude - limited sample , composed of a mix of stellar populations .",
    "this value of @xmath102 falls between the rotation amplitudes implied by the los velocities of old and young stars , @xmath365 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "these results are quantitatively consistent with the natural hypothesis that the blue stars in our hst cmds have predominantly young - star kinematics and the red stars have predominantly old - star kinematics . these results resolve a puzzle posed by analysis of the two - epoch pm rotation curve amplitude .",
    "p08 previously reported @xmath366 , which was difficult to understand as it exceeded the rotation amplitude of both the young stars and the hi gas .",
    "after correction for asymmetric drift , we infer a circular velocity for the lmc of @xmath0 . the large uncertainty is due mostly to uncertainties in the inclination of the lmc .",
    "this @xmath361 places the lmc on the same baryonic tully - fisher relation defined by samples of other low - mass gas - rich galaxies .",
    "also , it implies an enclosed mass @xmath367 , out to the radius @xmath353 to which it has been verified that the rotation curve remains approximately flat .",
    "the virial mass of the lmc should be larger than this , with the exact value depending on how far the lmc s dark halo extends , and on whether it has been tidally truncated . if the lmc circular velocity curve remains flat outside of the region probed observationally , then the tidal radius is @xmath2 ( i.e. , a radius on the sky of @xmath3 ) .",
    "we have discussed three independent methods for combining pm and los velocity information to obtain a kinematical estimate for the lmc distance . while each of these methods yields results that are consistent with existing knowledge , none of them is currently competitive in terms of accuracy .",
    "this is due in large part to the fact that the exact viewing angles of the lmc continue to be poorly understood .",
    "these distance determination methods might become competitive in the future , if better pm data become available and our understanding of the structure and orientation of the lmc improve further .",
