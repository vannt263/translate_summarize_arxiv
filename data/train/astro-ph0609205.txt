    "this feature is most likely an instrumental effect similar to other features observed in the ( excluded ) energy range below 0.8 kev .",
    "there are other large residuals around 1 kev ; these may indicate that , instead of the ne abundance scaling with the fe abundance ( in which case , the ne / fe abundance ratio would be one with respect to the solar ratio , which is 3.8 ) , the ne / fe abundance ratio is greater than this value .",
    "alternatively , it could also indicate the presence of a lower temperature component , which we could not constrain , as its major contributor is at energies @xmath291 kev .",

    "the residuals plotted are deviations of the model from the data , calculated in units of @xmath32 .",

    "the length scales exceed the primary stellar radius ( @xmath33r@xmath15 ) and the binary separation ( @xmath483.4@xmath010@xmath49 cm , * ? ? ?",
    "there have been numerous discussions in the literature concerning the thermal or nonthermal nature of hard x - ray emission from solar flares @xcite .",
    "because other lines of evidence exist which confirm that particle acceleration does occur during stellar flares ( mostly microwave gyrosynchrotron emission ) , we consider a model which describes bremsstrahlung emission from suprathermal electrons .",
    "the arguments which apply to 3@xmath010@xmath6 thermal plasma apply also to the second temperature component found in orbits 1 and 2 ( t@xmath50 from 1.21.5 @xmath010@xmath6 in orbit 1 , t@xmath50 from 79 @xmath010@xmath51 k in orbit 2 ) with only a slight easement of the physical restrictions described above .",
    "however , the line information present in the he - like and h - like iron transitions confirm the existence of this plasma , whereas the 3@xmath010@xmath6 component comes from continuum emission at hard x - ray energies .",

    "we implemented a thick - target bremsstrahlung code in xspec to model the behavior of the hard x - ray photons .",
    "the spectral shape is determined by the power - law index of the electron injection spectrum ; the normalization depends on the total power input in accelerated electrons and the low - energy cutoff in the electron injection spectrum .",
    "we can not constrain the cutoff with our dataset , and fix this value to an arbitrary value of 20 kev often used in solar flare analysis @xcite .",
    "recent rhessi solar flare results @xcite have determined 37 kev as the highest value consistent with their data , although much lower energy cutoffs ( down to a few kev ) have also been determined @xcite .",
    "this value ( 20 kev ) is roughly comparable with the approximate location in the spectrum where the nonthermal spectrum starts to dominate .",
    "note that the choice of low energy cutoff has dramatic consequences for the power input in accelerated electrons : decreasing the cutoff to a lower value @xmath60 increases the power input necessary to reproduce the spectrum by a factor @xmath61 , or a factor @xmath23 two higher for @xmath62 and @xmath63 kev .",
    "the fact that the 3rd temperature component in orbit 2 is also unphysically high , coupled with the large residuals above 20 kev between model and data for a two - temperature fit and the @xmath37 statistic for the 2 temperature plus nonthermal model being nearly the same as for the three temperature model , leads us to conclude that there is evidence for nonthermal emission into the decay phase of the flare . indeed , since the thermal plasma has cooled ( @xmath64 8@xmath010@xmath51k in orbit 2 compared with t@xmath651.4@xmath010@xmath6k in orbit 1 ) , the discrepancy between model and data for the two - temperature model shows up at smaller x - ray energies ( see figure  [ fig : spec2 ] ) . based on either the three temperature model or the two temperature plus nonthermal model , in orbit 1",

    "we discuss the implications of each of these for the physics of flares in the following sections .",
    "high temperature plasma ( @xmath5 5@xmath010@xmath51k ) is evident in all four time intervals .",
    "the hottest component , @xmath23 1.8@xmath010@xmath6k , appears during the trigger , although this result is based only on 10200 kev continuum emission .",
    "the spectral fitting to orbits 1 and 2 involving models with two or more temperature components returns a high temperature ( @xmath370150 @xmath010@xmath4k ) which is generally hotter in orbit 1 than in orbit 2 .",
    "we have argued in a previous section (  3.2 ) that the temperature returned by modelling the spectra in orbits 1 and 2 with three temperature components is not as plausible as the existence of a nonthermal thick - target bremsstrahlung emission component at hard x - ray energies , and so we will ignore the three temperature fits in favor of the nonthermal interpretation .",
    "the two temperature fit to the spectrum in orbit 3 also reveals evidence for plasma at @xmath23 5@xmath010@xmath4k .",
    "thus , the general trend appears to be that the plasma is cooling during this progression from the trigger through orbit 3 , as deduced by the decrease in the hottest temperature component from these spectral fits , with an exponential decay time of @xmath33 hours .    the correspondence in many solar flares between thermal coronal energies and the amount and timescale of nonthermal energy deposition ( the  neupert effect ",
    "* ) lends credence to the posited physical association between particle acceleration and coronal heating .",
    "stellar flares also sometimes show evidence of the neupert effect , although typically radio emission or other proxies for hard x - ray emission ( e.g. optical white - light flares ) are used to compare with soft x - ray thermal radiation @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the temporal relationship between the soft x - ray emission and hard x - ray emission in this flare to see if it shows the neupert effect . in this case , the time rate of change of the thermal energy content of the corona ( as revealed by soft x - ray radiation ) should be roughly equivalent to the instantaneous nonthermal energy luminosity , @xmath75 .",
    "the 40101 kev energy band of the bat spectrum appears to be dominated by power - law hard x - ray emission , so we use this light curve to describe the temporal variation in nonthermal energy deposition .",
    "the thermal coronal energy is released mainly in the 0.810 kev energy band , so we use this light curve to constrain the temporal evolution in the thermal energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : neupert ] displays the correspondence between the derivative of the xrt light curve and the instantaneous nonthermal hard x - ray emission .",
    "the greatest correlation occurs during the first part of orbit 1 .",
    "we take this as suggestive of a neupert effect relationship between the nonthermal hard x - ray emission and thermal coronal radiation , although there is complex behavior here , as the nonthermal hard x - ray emission appears to persist into the decay phase of the flare .",
    "an additional complication lies in whether the plasma heating to such high temperatures takes place concurrently with , or as a result of , the particle acceleration producing the nonthermal emission .",
    "the neupert effect argues for a causal relationship between particle acceleration and plasma heating .",
    "the energy dissipation which sets off the chain of events seen in a flare can heat plasma as well as accelerate particles @xcite ; the exact proportion depends on the partition between plasma heating and particle acceleration , which is unknown .",
    "it is possible that plasma heating to the high temperatures seen during the trigger and subsequent orbits occurs before or concurrently with particle acceleration , although we can not constrain the presence of the nonthermal component during the time of the trigger , due to poor signal - to - noise constraints , and we also can not deduce what the pre - trigger conditions were .",

    "a situation where primary plasma heating and secondary plasma heating due to energy lost by nonthermal electrons would be more complicated .",

    "the current flare confirms that a strong bias exists in detecting nonthermal hard x - ray emission from stellar flares , as very large and energetic ( and hence rare , due to the flare frequency - energy relationship ) flares are needed to achieve detections of nonthermal emission at hard x - ray energies .",
    "this problem is further compounded by the addition of the superhot thermal component , itself a consequence of the large flare , which complicates detection of the nonthermal component in the hard x - ray spectrum .",

    "we note that the total radiated energy over all wavelengths from the few solar flares in which changes in total solar irradiance have been made @xcite indicate that the total radiated flare energy can be larger than the radiated energy of the hot plasma by a factor of up to ten .",

    "this is probably an upper limit on the amount of conducted energy , as evidence from solar flares indicates @xcite that the classical expression for conductive flux may overestimate the total energy decay rate .",
    "we estimate the total energy represented by nonthermal electrons during orbits 1 and 2 by multiplying the power output by the exposure time .",
    "we can not diagnose variations in the acceleration of electrons on shorter timescales , due to signal - to - noise limitations , so these calculations assume that electron acceleration occurs at a constant level during each orbit . in orbit 1 @xmath10710@xmath9 erg , and in orbit 2 @xmath1072 @xmath010@xmath9 erg , where the low energy cutoff of 20 kev was used . in order to match the thermal energy ( here assumed to be dominated by conductive energy losses ) with the nonthermal energy input , we obtain a constrain on the product of electron density and length scale , @xmath10860 for orbit 1 and @xmath10820 for orbit 2 .",

    "figure  [ fig : feka ] displays a close - up of the 5.58 kev region , and table  [ tbl : feka ] lists the results of spectral fitting for the five different time - resolved spectra .",
    "previous observations of k@xmath14 emission from stars other than the sun have been of pre - main sequence stars and have concluded that the fluoresced material is located in the circumstellar disk which is bathed in the thermal hard x - ray continuum radiation emitted by flaring plasma . applying this interpretation to the event on ii  peg poses several problems , however .",
    "the equivalent width of the 6708 lithium resonance line and the lithium abundance are not consistent with a pre - main sequence evolutionary state , nor is the observed c / n ratio ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the system is therefore generally considered to be an old - disk population star . on the other hand , an infrared excess appears to have been detected in ii  peg @xcite which is rather unexpected for a pop i star .",
    "further , the column densities returned from x - ray spectral fitting are systematically higher than previously determined interstellar values for this line of sight , suggesting the possibility of additional absorption from a circumstellar disk .",
    "however , we consider the column density returned from spectral fitting highly suspect , as we have excluded the energy range below 0.8 kev due to systematics , and there could be additional unrecognized systematics affecting the absorption column density .",
