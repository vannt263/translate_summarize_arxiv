    "although the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite ( fqhe ) has not yet been observed in graphene , several papers have studied this possibility theoretically both in the su(2 ) limit@xcite ( when the zeeman splitting is not small but the valleys are degenerate ) and in the su(4 ) limit@xcite ( when both spins and valleys are degenerate ) .",
    "these studies show that , as for gaas , the fqhe states are well described by the composite fermion ( cf ) theory@xcite and occur at the filling factors @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the partial filling of electrons ( corresponding to total filling of @xmath4 ) or holes@xcite ( at @xmath5 ) in the graphene landau level with index @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the cf vorticity , and @xmath8 is the number of filled @xmath9 levels ( also known as cf landau levels ) .",
    "there are differences , however .",
    "while fqhe in gaas is much stronger in the lowest landau level ( ll ) , the fqhe in graphene is expected to be as strong in the @xmath10 landau level as in the @xmath0 ll@xcite .",
    "more interestingly , many new incompressible cf states become possible because of the su(4 ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "this work addresses the nature of the state at @xmath11 .",
    "if the model of weakly interacting composite fermions remains valid in the limit of @xmath12 , then we expect a fermi sea of composite fermions . in gaas",
    ", the fully spin polarized fermi sea of composite fermions has been extensively studied@xcite and confirmed@xcite at @xmath13 , and good evidence exists for a spin - singlet cf fermi sea ( cffs ) in the limit of vanishing zeeman energy@xcite . at @xmath14 in the second ( @xmath1 ) landau level , it is currently believed , although not confirmed , that the residual interactions between composite fermions produce a p - wave paired state of composite fermions , described by a pfaffian wave function@xcite . in still higher landau levels an anisotropic stripe phase is believed to occur .",
    "cf fermi sea is an obvious candidate at half fillings in graphene , although it will have a richer structure associated with it . in the su(4 ) symmetric limit , the mean field model of composite fermions predicts an su(4 ) singlet cf fermi sea , which has no analog in gaas .",
    "the p - wave paired state of composite fermions is also a promising candidate , especially at @xmath15 in the @xmath1 ll , and it is interesting to ask if the graphene coulomb matrix elements can make it more stable than the standard gaas coulomb matrix elements . for completeness , we also consider a so - called hollow - core state@xcite describing the spin - singlet pairing of composite fermions , and , as in gaas@xcite , find it not to be relevant .",
    "we note that our @xmath0 landau level results below , as well as in ref . , also apply to the cf physics in valley degenerate semiconductor systems @xcite .",
    "the low - energy states of graphene are described in the continuum approximation by a massless dirac hamiltonian@xcite @xmath16 that acts on a 4-spinor hilbert space . here",
    "@xmath17 denotes the spin and @xmath18 the pseudospin associated with the valley degree of freedom , @xmath19 m / s is the fermi velocity , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the on - site energy difference between the two sublattices .",
    "the single particle spectrum of @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the eigenvalues of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , and @xmath6 is the landau level index . in the limit @xmath27",
    "each landau level is 4-fold degenerate , giving rise to an su(4 ) internal symmetry .",
    "we consider below only the su(4 ) symmetric part of the hamiltonian explicitly ; from these results , the energy of any given wave function in the presence of certain kinds of symmetry breaking terms ( for example , the zeeman coupling ) can be obtained straightforwardly , and level crossing transitions as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath21 can be obtained . the conditions for su(4 )",
    "symmetry have been discussed in refs .   and .",
    "because we are interested in bulk properties , we will use the spherical geometry , in which electrons move on the surface of a sphere and a radial magnetic field is produced by a magnetic monopole of strength @xmath29 at the center.@xcite here @xmath30 is the magnetic flux through the surface of the sphere ; @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is an integer according to dirac s quantization condition .    the interelectron interaction is conveniently parametrized in terms of pseudopotentials@xcite @xmath33 , where @xmath33 is the energy of two electrons in relative angular momentum state @xmath8 .",
    "the problem of interacting electrons in the @xmath6-th ll of graphene can be mapped into a problem of electrons in the @xmath0 ll with an effective interaction that has pseudopotentials@xcite @xmath34 where the form factor @xmath35 is @xmath36 for an evaluation of the energies of various variational wave functions by the monte carlo method , we need the real - space interaction . in the @xmath0 ll this interaction",
    "is simply @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is taken as the chord distance in the spherical geometry . in other landau levels",
    "we use an effective real - space interaction in the lowest landau level that reproduces the higher landau level pseudopotentials in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) .",
    "we determine such an effective real space interaction in the _ planar _ geometry , and use it on the sphere .",
    "this procedure is exact in the thermodynamic limit , and it is usually reasonable also for finite systems . following ref .",

    ", we will use the following consequence of fock s cyclic condition@xcite .",
    "the orbital part of one member of the su(@xmath6 ) , namely the highest weight state , can be constructed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 s are slater determinants such that any state @xmath43 in @xmath42 is also filled in @xmath44 ( conversely , if @xmath43 is empty in @xmath42 , then it is also empty in @xmath45 ) ; @xmath46 is the projection into the lowest ( @xmath0 ) landau level@xcite ; and the last factor , the jastrow factor , attaches @xmath7 vortices to each fermion .",

    "we define the cf fermi sea as the thermodynamic limit of an integral number of filled landau levels at an effective monopole strength @xmath55 for composite fermions .",

    "we also consider the hollow - core state @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an @xmath66 matrix .",
    "this state is a spin singlet in the system with su(2 ) symmetry ; its symmetry becomes su(2)@xmath67su(2 ) in the su(4 ) symmetric limit . because of the last factor in eqs .",
    "( [ pfaff1 ] ) and ( [ hollow1 ] ) , which converts electrons into composite fermions , these wave functions describe paired states of composite fermions .",
    "we have studied cf fermi sea states containing as many as 256 composite fermions ( 64 particles per landau band ) , and our principal results@xcite are given in fig .",
    "[ fs ] and table [ energies ] .",
    "these pertain to fillings @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) ; @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) ; @xmath15 ( @xmath72 ) ; @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "( in relating @xmath3 to @xmath75 , we have included the possibility of forming the state from either electrons or holes in a given landau level . )",
    "when the spin or valley degeneracy is broken , the above study applies to many other half integral states also . to obtain the energy of the cf fermi sea , we consider finite systems at @xmath76 and extrapolate the energy to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the energies at @xmath15 have a complicated dependence on @xmath77 , which makes extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit difficult .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn .",
    "\\(i ) for all fractions shown in fig .  [ fs ] , the hollow - core state has a very high energy and is therefore not relevant .",
    "\\(ii ) the pfaffian wave function also has higher energy than all of the cf fermi sea states for all filling factors studied . in particular",
    ", it has higher energy than the fully polarized cf fermi sea ( @xmath78 $ ] ) in the @xmath1 ll , in contrast to gaas where the fully polarized cf fermi sea has higher energy@xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the pfaffian state is not stabilized in either @xmath0 or @xmath10 landau level in graphene .",
    "interestingly , for the fully polarized state , the overlaps given in table [ pfaff ] indicate the pfaffian wave function is actually a better representation of the exact coulomb ground state at @xmath15 in the @xmath1 ll of graphene than it is of the 5/2 state in gaas ( for the latter , the overlaps are 0.87 and 0.84 for 8 and 10 particles , respectively@xcite ) ; nonetheless , energetic considerations rule out the pfaffian state at @xmath15 in graphene .",
    "\\(iii ) the overlaps given in table [ pfaff ] show that the pfaffian is significantly worse at @xmath79 , indicating that it is not stabilized in the @xmath80 ll of graphene either .",
    "\\(iv ) we have considered cf fermi sea wave functions of four distinct symmetries , ranging from su(4 ) singlet to fully polarized .",
    "all of these have lower energies than either the pfaffian or the hollow - core state . without any symmetry breaking term ,",
    "the su(4 ) singlet cf fermi sea has the lowest energy at @xmath68 , as expected from the model of non - interacting composite fermions .",
    "when the zeeman and the pseudo - zeeman energies are turned on , we expect a  partially - polarized \" cf fermi sea , and eventually a fully polarized cf fermi sea .",
    "\\(v ) the cf fermi sea is also favored for @xmath15 and @xmath81 , but the energy differences between the various cf fermi sea states are very small , less than the statistical error in our monte carlo evaluations .",
    ".[energies ] the thermodynamic limit of the energy per particle , in units of @xmath82 , for various cf fermi sea ( cffs ) states as well as the pfaffian and the hollow - core wave functions at @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "the notation for the cffs state is explained in the text .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     other authors@xcite have considered a cf fermi sea state at @xmath86 , where the fourfold degenerate @xmath0 ll is half full . here , the electron ( or hole ) density in the @xmath0 landau level is @xmath87 , which , upon composite fermionization of _ all _ electrons , gives an effective field of @xmath88 for composite fermions , which should be contrasted with @xmath76 at @xmath89 .",
    "khveschenko@xcite considers a state in which each of the four degenerate landau bands is half filled forming a cf fermi sea ; the flux attachment does not introduce correlations between different bands in this approach . finally , we comment on some of the approximations made in the model considered above .",
    "we have neglected ll mixing in our calculation ; given that the energy difference between the cffs and the pfaffian states is fairly large (  3 - 5% ) , we believe that ll mixing will not cause a phase transition into a pfaffian ground state , which is known to become worse with ll mixing@xcite .",
