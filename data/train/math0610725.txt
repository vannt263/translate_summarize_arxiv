    "indeed , here we deal with a simplified version of davis pdps , but still enough general to cover many interesting models .",
    "the definition of pdp is more popular between researchers working on operations research and probability calculus ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , rather than others outside these fields , even though the latter unknowingly use it , at least in a simplified form .",
    "before to proceed with the discussion of the numerical solution of our problem , we give a short introduction of the underling pdp process we are considering here .",

    "each state @xmath20 is characterised by an its own probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath23 of `` transition events '' : @xmath24 * when a transition event occurs , the dynamics switches instantaneously from the state @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) to a new state @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , given randomly by the transition probability matrix ( or transition measure ) : @xmath29 the position @xmath14 of the process is not affected when the state switches .",
    "assumptions ( [ rte_estesa_1 ] ) , ( [ rte_estesa_2 ] ) and ( [ rte_estesa_3 ] ) define the three _ local characteristics _ of the pdp . we see that eq .",
    "( [ rte_estesa_1 ] ) can be integrated as an ordinary differential equation , provided that not any switching event happen inside the integration interval .",
    "therefore , with the exceptions of switching times , the process is deterministic , continuous and composed of pieces of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ rte_estesa_1 ] ) .",
    "anyway , the whole resulting process @xmath14 is not deterministic , it represents a random sample path on a probability space . the statistical description of the process is given by the unknown functions @xmath13 : each represents the probability to find the process @xmath14 , in the state @xmath20 , at time @xmath30 in a position less than @xmath31 , being past the time @xmath32 since the last switching event .",

    "the function @xmath42 , named _ hazard function _ ( or _ hazard rate _ ) , is related to the statistics of the pdf switching times ( [ rte_estesa_2 ] ) by : @xmath43 it represents the probability per unit of time that a transition event will occur , i.e. a transition rate , having past the time @xmath35 since the last event .",

    "we note that numerical methods for solving linear hyperbolic pdes with non - constant coefficient , such as ( [ basic_kolmogorov ] ) , are well known in literature @xcite , but what makes this problem a little special is the boundary condition ( [ basic_boundary ] ) : the value of the unknowns @xmath45 , on the boundary @xmath46 , depend on an integration of the @xmath45 over the interior of the domain .",

    "the secondary , but not of minor importance , aim of this article is to provide a connection bridge between pdps as known by experts of the field and , as above mentioned , the same processes as known by others , who apply them to modelling in several areas of science and engineering .",
    "here we give a sample of quotas , for which pdps can be concerned by others , grouped in two categories : diffusive processes and systems having an equilibrium .",
    "we mention : anomalous diffusion @xcite , reaction - diffusion @xcite , scattering of radiation @xcite , biological dispersal @xcite , for the former category , and non - maxwellian equilibriums @xcite , diagnostic techniques for semiconductor lasers @xcite , filtered telegraph signals @xcite , harmonic oscillators @xcite , ecological systems @xcite , for the latter .",
    "many of the models involved in such references , concern the application of a two - state noise to a dynamical equation .",
    "the common end of all these researches , consists in extracting statistical properties from process governed by that equation .",
    "generally an approximation method can be applied to the original model : such as by the projector technique @xcite , by a `` coarse - grain '' technique , ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , an asymptotic analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "concerning this , we remark that the main alternative is based on the inclusion of _ supplementary variables _",
