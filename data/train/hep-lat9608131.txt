    "field configurations with non - zero topological charge are expected to have a strong influence on the dynamics of asymptotically free theories .",
    "the study of these effects however requires non - perturbative techniques and one would expect that ultimately monte carlo methods on the lattice would be best suited to it .",
    "the gold - plated observable is the topological susceptibility @xmath2 , as inspired by the large-@xmath3 analyses . in the continuum it is given by , @xmath4 @xmath5 being the topological charge density , @xmath6 .",
    "\\label{contq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the topological charge , @xmath7 , is an integer if the field strength vanishes at infinity or if ( euclidean ) space - time is compact .",
    "a continuum analysis shows that the action of any configuration with non - zero topological charge must satisfy the following bound , @xmath8 which is saturated by instantons , @xmath9 .",
    "there are several choices for the operator @xmath5 on the lattice .",
    "we will deal only with the geometrical definition due to lscher @xcite , which gives an integer - valued topological charge and does not require renormalization .    the topological susceptibility in qcd",
    "is expected to scale as @xmath10 in the continuum limit .",
    "however , it was found @xcite that the wilson action gives rise to short - range fluctuations with non - zero geometrical topological charge and such a small action that they overwhelm the contribution of slowly varying fields and can destroy the expected scaling .",
    "it is easy to understand how these fluctuations called dislocations result from the mismatch between the geometrical definition of topological charge and the wilson action .",
    "consider a continuum instanton @xmath11 which saturates the bound ( [ contbound ] ) , and discretize it on a lattice of spacing @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the sites of the @xmath12 lattice .",
    "the geometrical definition of topological charge assigns a non - zero value even to a lattice configuration ( [ dis ] ) obtained from very small instantons , of @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that the wilson action approximates very poorly the continuum action for such rough configurations , and in fact it turns out to be smaller , strongly violating the bound ( [ contbound ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a semiclassical continuum analysis of dilute instantons indicates that for any theory in which the continuum susceptibility is well - defined , there exists an @xmath16 such that , if the action of topologically non - trivial configurations is always larger than @xmath17 , the susceptibility is ultraviolet finite @xcite . thus satisfying this minimum bound",
    "@xmath18 is a sufficient condition for scaling of the susceptibility .",
    "we will show that our new action satisfies this minimum bound .",
    "there are two important observations that led us to consider the new action proposed in @xcite .",
    "the first is that the geometrical topological charge assigned to a lattice configuration is just the naive topological charge of a _ continuum _ configuration obtained by smoothly interpolating the lattice configuration .",
    "then it is clear that if , instead of using the standard wilson action of the original lattice configuration , we use the continuum action of the interpolated configuration , the continuum bound is necessarily satisfied , as first suggested in @xcite .",
    "more concretely , in @xcite we described a procedure to obtain a continuum gauge field @xmath19 which interpolates any @xmath12-lattice configuration ) gives back @xmath20 @xcite . ] .",
    "the interpolation is local and gauge covariant , i.e. for a @xmath12-lattice gauge transformation @xmath21 , @xmath22 = a_\\mu^\\omega[u ] , \\label{gi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a gauge transformation in the continuum .",
    "a geometrical topological charge of the @xmath12-lattice configuration is defined as the one associated to the interpolated field @xcite , @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{topcharge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , it is clear that replacing the standard wilson action by the continuum action of @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 , \\label{contac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ensures that the continuum bound is satisfied for the same reason as it is in the continuum .",
    "notice that this is a perfectly gauge invariant action for the lattice field @xmath20 , by eq .",
    "( [ gi ] ) .",
    "the only problem with the action ( [ contac ] ) is that it is computationally impractical .",
    "the second and central observation is that using ( [ contac ] ) is in fact not necessary .",
    "an action defined on a finer lattice , with lattice spacing @xmath27 ( we will take @xmath28 to be integer ) , that approximates @xmath29 to just enough precision so that the minimum bound is satisfied , will ensure the scaling of the topological susceptibility , as explained above .",
    "if the required ratio @xmath30 turns out to be not too small , the new action will be much easier to compute than ( [ contac ] ) .",
    "more precisely , referring to @xmath31 as the sites on the @xmath27-lattice and @xmath32 as the sites on the @xmath12-lattice ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , the interpolation procedure in @xcite gives a set of link variables @xmath35(x)$ ] , such that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the continuum interpolation discussed above , at point @xmath31 . on the @xmath27 lattice , we can simply choose the standard wilson action .",
    "the partition functional will then have the form , @xmath38 } ,   \\label{effact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath39 is the usual haar measure for non - abelian gauge fields on the @xmath12-lattice , and the wilson action in terms of the interpolated link variables @xmath40 $ ] is given by , @xmath41 = \\frac{1}{g_0 ^ 2 } \\sum_x \\sum_{\\mu\\neq\\nu } ( i - u_{\\mu\\nu}[x ] + h.c . ) , \\label{actna}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 $ ] being the @xmath27-plaquette variable . again , this action is gauge invariant , because the functional @xmath40 $ ] is gauge covariant @xcite and from eq .",
    "( [ imp ] ) it then follows that , @xmath43 + o(f / b ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] determining how small the ratio @xmath30 must be to satisfy @xmath44 requires a numerical analysis . in the next section we present a first numerical study of this issue in a simplified model in two dimensions .",
    "the results encourage us to believe that @xmath45 need not be very small in order to recover scaling of @xmath2 .",
    "as is well known the o(3 ) @xmath1-model in two dimensions shares many similarities with yang - mills @xcite . in the continuum , the model is defined by the action , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a 3-component real field satisfying the constraint @xmath48 .",
    "the continuum topological charge in this model measures the number of times that space - time wraps around the @xmath47-sphere . in a standard lattice treatment",
    "the action , @xmath49 , is the naive discretization of ( [ o3stan ] ) , while the geometrical topological charge @xmath50 was first defined on the lattice in @xcite . in the continuum , all topologically non - trivial configurations satisfy @xmath51 , however , the standard action @xmath52 gives rise to dislocations , i.e. configurations with @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "these artifacts disappear when the action is improved along the lines of the previous section .",
    "the new action , @xmath54 , is defined on a finer lattice , where the spin variables are obtained from a geodesic interpolation of the original variables ( see @xcite for explicit formulae ) .",
    "this new action then satisfies @xmath55 @xcite .    as a first numerical study of the improvement as a function of the ratio @xmath30 , we considered the discretization of continuum instanton configurations with unit topological charge @xcite ( which saturate the continuum bound ) .",
    "such configurations are characterized by a radius @xmath56 and a center that we fix at the center of the volume to reduce finite volume effects .",
    "figure 1 summarizes our results .",
    "it represents the action of the discretized instanton configuration as the radius is varied , normalized to the continuum one - instanton bound .",
    "generically there is always a critical , @xmath57 , below which @xmath58 ( vertical line ) .",
    "the continuous curve corresponds to the standard action , while the dashed ones correspond to the improved action for different values of the ratio @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that the standard action is problematic , since for @xmath59 the action is considerably smaller than the continuum bound .",
    "for the new action however the continuum bound is satisfied already for a ratio of @xmath30 as large as @xmath60 ! furthermore , as the instanton is shrunk to sizes of @xmath15 , a small barrier develops , separating the @xmath61 and @xmath62 sectors .",
    "this is expected because the interpolation of a discretized instanton of size @xmath15 is generically no longer an instanton ( and it is further from it as the radius of the original instanton decreases ) .",
    "this is why the action of configurations with @xmath59 increases as @xmath63 near @xmath64 .",
    "although the results for the @xmath0 model are very promising , a numerical analysis is needed in the yang - mills case to determine the required ratio @xmath30 there .",
    "if it turns out to be moderate , the action ( [ actna ] ) should be practical in mc simulations .",
