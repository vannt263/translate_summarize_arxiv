    "as discussed for instance by sprouse _",
    "et al _ @xcite the recent development of laser cooling and trapping of radioactive atoms opens ways for new investigations like the search for the electric dipole moment ( edm ) , @xmath4 decay , cold atom - atom collisions , bose - einstein condensation and more precise atomic clocks . as the heaviest alkali - metal atom",
    ", francium offers a sensitive test of the influence of relativistic and quantum electrodynamic effects ( qed ) on the atomic structure .",
    "it is also an excellent system to study weak interactions in atoms such as atomic parity non - conservation ( pnc ) @xcite .",
    "however , none of the francium istopes is stable .",
    "the longest - lived isotope is @xmath5fr with a half - time of 21.8 min , while the shortest - lived isotope @xmath6fr has a half - time of 0.12 @xmath7s .",
    "several groups have been successful in trapping long - lived isotopes in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) : in 1995 , simsarian _",
    "et al _ captured @xmath8fr atoms ( half - time 3.2 min ) produced at the stony brook linac @xcite ; a collaboration between the groups of c. wieman from the university of colorado and h. gould from lawrence berkeley laboratory lead to the trapping of @xmath9fr ( half time 4.8 min ) @xcite ; more recently , a @xmath8fr mot has been set up in legnaro ( italy ) @xcite , but to our knoweledge its optimization is still under way .    even if the spectroscopy of francium atom is not yet fully investigated , a noticeable amount of experimental and theoretical data is now available for energy levels , hyperfine splittings , and transition dipole moments .",
    "in contrast , experimental conditions allowing to form francium dimers have not yet been achieved , and the availability of cold francium atoms in mot s may allow one day to perform the photoassociation spectroscopy of such radioactive molecules .",
    "the creation of a mixed species cold atom trap involving francium and rubidium or cesium appears as a closer possibility @xcite , which would allow to explore the rbfr or csfr heteronuclear molecules .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "no potential curves have been published yet on these molecular systems . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only results concern the bond length and the dissociation energy of fr@xmath0 which have been determined by lim _",
    "et al _ @xcite using various approaches based on relativistic coupled - cluster method or functional density theory .",
    "also the van der waals interactions between fr , rb , and cs atoms have been computed by derevianko _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the electronic properties of fr@xmath0 , rbfr , and csfr and of their cations , including potential curves , permanent and transition dipole moments .",
    "our aim is also to predict the rates for the photoassociation and for the formation of cold molecules , as we did previously for all mixed alkali dimers involving li to cs atoms @xcite .",
    "such predictions should be useful for upcoming experimental investigations .",
    "our theoretical method relies on effective potentials for modelling the fr@xmath1 ionic core , as in our previous paper ( hereafter identified as paper i ) @xcite devoted to the accurate determination of permanent dipole moments of heteronuclear alkali dimers .",
    "the combination of large - core pseudopotentials ( namely one active valence electron per alkali atom ) , complemented by core - polarization pseudopotentials ( cpp ) following the idea of mller and meyer @xcite has proved up to now to be one of the most successful approaches to accurately deal with the electronic structure of alkali pairs , even up to cesium @xcite .",
    "one of the advantage of the large - core+cpp approach is that it allows full configuration interaction ( ci ) even in large basis sets for the valence electrons ( reduced to 2 in the case of alkali diatomics ) , and that the core polarization mimics the effect of coupled core - valence double excitations that otherwise should be calculated in the ci .",
    "moreover , even for compounds including cesium , most calculations were performed within the framework of the so - called scalar ( i.e. spin - orbit averaged ) pseudopotentials , or averaged relativistic pseudopotentials ( arep ) @xcite , which take into account scalar relativistic effects ( mass correction , darwin term ) @xcite .",
    "the definition of quasi - relativistic pseudopotentials is actually closely linked to the way electrostatic and spin - orbit coupling are treated .",
    "arep s are very convenient for molecular calculations , as configuration interaction is achieved in a first step , whereas spin - orbit coupling responsible for multiplicity splitting is accounted for a - posteriori .",
    "other schemes have been implemented in the case of heavy elements where spin - orbit coupling is large , namely two - component schemes @xcite in the basis of spinors which treat electrostatic and spin - orbit coupling on an equal footing in the configuration interaction .",
    "four - component ci calculations are also sometimes feasible @xcite but still require a heavy computational effort with respect to the other methods .",
    "detailed and recent overviews of the various techniques can be found in references @xcite . in alkali diatomics ,",
    "spin - orbit coupling does not directly concern the ground state but only the excited states , and it therefore remains relatively small , even for lowest excited states of the heavy elements : the cs(@xmath10 ) fine structure splitting is 554 @xmath11 , and the one of fr(@xmath12 ) is 1686 @xmath11 @xcite , to be compared for instance with the one of iodine , close to 1 ev .",
    "core - valence correlation is a larger effect in heavy alkalis , especially for the lowest valence states , closer to the core .",
    "even more important is the two - electron valence correlation in alkali diatomics which must be treated accurately .",
    "this is why quasi - relativistic calculations with averaged relativistic large - core pseudopotentials complemented by cpp s proved to be very accurate for complexes of alkali atoms at least up to cesium @xcite .    given this ability , it is appealing to extend this simple scheme to systems including the heaviest atom of the series , namely francium .",
    "we have therefore determined a spin - orbit - averaged semi - local pseudopotential for francium in the large - core approach , namely with a single external electron , using the shape - consistent norm - conserving technique of durand and barthelat @xcite , complemented with core - polarization pseudopotentials ( cpp ) .",
    "we describe in detail in section [ sec : atom ] the chosen model , that we compare to the model potential approach of klapisch @xcite .",
    "we recall in section [ sec : mole ] the main steps of the molecular calculations , and our results for molecular ions and neutral diatomics of francium coumpounds .",
    "atomic units will be used throughout the text , except otherwise stated .",
    "in 1939 , m. perey of the curie institute in paris discovered a new radioactive element that she named francium @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of francium remained unknown until 1978 when the d@xmath0 line of francium was detected by liberman _",
    "et al _ at cern on the on - line mass separator isolde @xcite .",
    "then the precise spectroscopy of francium isotopes was performed by the same group still at cern @xcite , while the properties of fr highly excited states were explored at moscow university @xcite .",
    "after 1995 , spectroscopic studies were carried on with cold trapped francium atoms @xcite .",
    "hyperfine splittings @xcite and radiative lifetime measurements @xcite became then available . among the energy levels , @xmath13 levels and",
    "rydberg @xmath14 series have been the most investigated using two - step or two - photon excitation from the @xmath12 manifold @xcite , as well as the @xmath15 and @xmath16 multiplets .",
    "an ionization potential of 32848.972(9)@xmath11 has been determined from the quantum defects of @xmath17 and @xmath18 rydberg levels @xcite .",
    "however the lowest @xmath19 levels have not been observed yet , even if their location has been predicted using quantum defects fits of @xmath20 energies @xcite .",
    "levels of higher symmetry ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) as well as @xmath23 levels beyond @xmath24 remain unknown .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "dzuba _ et al _",
    "@xcite used relativistic hartree - fock and many - body perturbation theory to calculate the transition energies , fine structure intervals , electric transition amplitudes , and addressed the issue of parity violation in this atom .",
    "et al _ @xcite calculated ground and excited transition energies as well as ionization potentials and electron affinities @xcite for all alkali atoms including fr , with the relativistic coupled - cluster method .",
    "relativistic many - body calculations of transition energies , hyperfine constants , electric - dipole matrix elements and static polarizabilites were performed by safronava _",
    "et al _ for all alkali atoms @xcite .",
    "@xcite used many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) and model - potential calculations to investigate low - energy photoionization parameters for fr .",
    "the same model - potential approach has been adopted by marinescu @xcite to compute long - range parameters for all alkali pairs but fr and by marinescu _",
    "@xcite for a francium atom pair .",
    "more recently , long - range parameters for homonuclear and heteronuclear alkali dimers including fr have been calculated by derevianko _",
    "et al _ @xcite using relativistic coupled - cluster method .",
    "all these data represent a rich starting point for our molecular calculations which first impliy the determination of an accurate effective potential for the representation of the francium ionic core .",
    "we performed three different atomic calculations .",
    "we first implemented for francium the parametric energy - adjusted model potential ( mp ) proposed by klapisch @xcite , further improved to involve @xmath25-dependent parameters ( with @xmath25 the orbital moment of the valence electron ) , core polarization effects , and spin - orbit terms @xcite .",
    "accurate atomic energy levels are obtained , allowing the use of mp predicted levels to check the quality of the pseudopotential described below .",
    "however , the klapisch type model potentials conserve the nodal structure of the wavefunctions even within the core region , which is not very convenient for molecular calculations , especially in such heavy elements . in line with previous works on alkali diatomics , we preferred to use a pseudopotential approach which yields nodeless atomic wave functions in the core region",
    ". we thus adopted a mean - field approach extraction .",
    "we first performed relativistic dirac - fock scf calculations ( df ) with desclaux s package @xcite , to obtain single electron energies and spin - orbitals considered as reference data for subsequent pseudopotential determination .",
    "we then determined a spin - orbit - averaged semi - local pseudopotential ( pp ) for francium within the large - core approach , complemented with core - polarization pseudopotential ( cpp ) which will be used in molecular calculations of section [ sec : mole ] .",
    "such a model is known to be efficient for instance to calculate multiphoton cross sections of heavy alkali atoms k and cs @xcite and complicated spectra of heavy alkaline - earth atoms @xcite .",
    "a similar model potential without spin - orbit has been also used by other authors for the determination of the van der waals interaction between alkali atoms @xcite , or of photoionization parameters in fr @xcite .",
    "the semi - local model potentiel accounting for the interaction between the ionic core and the external electron depends on the empirical parameters @xmath26 and contains a polarization term involving the static dipole polarizability ( core- polarization contribution ) of the ionic core @xmath27 :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the nuclear charge , and @xmath30 are cut - off radii truncating the polarization potential at short electronic distances @xmath31 .",
    "we use the theoretical value for @xmath27=20.38  au @xcite obtained with fully relativistic coupled cluster method , in very good agreement with the value @xmath27=20.41  au computed using relativistic random phase approximation @xcite .",

    "the fine structure splitting of the @xmath41 level , @xmath42  @xmath11 , is found larger than in the cc value of ref.@xcite , @xmath43  @xmath11 , and also disagrees with the values predicted using quantum defects fits of @xmath44 energies @xcite ( @xmath45  @xmath11 ) .",

    "these predictions for energy levels will be used in the next paragraph .",
    "we actually used this approach to perform the molecular calculations for fr@xmath0 and rbfr and csfr compounds .",
    "the ionic core is described by a semi - local @xmath25-dependent pseudopotentiel ( pp ) @xcite employed in paper i :    @xmath49    as explained in paper i , and in contrast with the mp approach , the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 in equation [ eq : vps ] for rb and cs ionic cores are adjusted to reproduce the energies and valence orbitals of an all - electron hartree - fock self - consistent field ( scf ) calculation for the atomic ground state .",

    "this is fingerprinted by the size evolution of the lowest @xmath17 valence orbital , the @xmath58 orbital of francium being more contracted than the @xmath93 one of cesium , whenever relativistic effects are taken into account . indeed , dirac - fock calculations yields averaged radii values of 5.91  a@xmath94 for the @xmath58 orbital in francium and 6.08  a@xmath94 for the @xmath93 orbital in cesium , while the non - relativistic hf calculation reverses this hierarchy yielding 6.25  a@xmath94 for francium @xmath58 , and 5.85  a@xmath94 for cesium 6s .",
    "such orbital contractions were illustrated on atoms by desclaux @xcite . in the case of alkali s ,",
    "these contractions are further correlated with an increase of the atomic ionization potentials as discussed later on in the paper .",
    "this behaviour illustrates on francium compounds the influence of relativistic effects on the chemical bonding whenever heavy atoms are involved .",

    "it is easy to show that in heteronuclear alkali diatomics including atoms up to cs , the electron transfer from the heavy atom towards the light one is expected to be more favorable , due to the regular decrease of the ip s with increasing atom size which is not compensated by the corresponding variation of electron affinities .",

    "indeed , the ionization potential ip(fr)=32848 @xmath11 is larger by 1442 @xmath111 than the one of cs , almost half - way between ip(cs ) and ip(rb ) , whereas the electron affinity ea(fr)=3920 @xmath11 @xcite ( see also ref .",

    "the situation of rbfr is more ambiguous since the difference @xmath11657 @xmath11 is quite small , predicting a rb@xmath1fr@xmath3 arrangement .",
    "but the dipole moment is found negative and of small magnitude negative , compatible with a very weak electron transfer to form a rb@xmath3fr@xmath1 arrangement .",
    "this apparent disagreement may be due to an uncertainty on the calculated electron - affinity of francium @xcite , but it most probably demonstrates the role of the polarization forces occurring at finite distance , resulting from the subtle and self - consistent unscreening of the ion electric field by the one of the electrons .",
    "the equilibrium distance of the lowest triplet state is large , and the state behaves like a neural state due to spin - forbidden electron transfer .",
    "the dipole moment then remains very weak , but we remark that its variation for rbcs is opposite to the rbfr and rbcs ones . at shorter distances , the magnitudes of the dipole moments may be increased due to overlapping atomic distributions .",
    "it is also interesting to look at the fr@xmath0 excited states dissociating to the @xmath117 limits in order to verify if the fr@xmath0 system behaves similarly to the cs@xmath0 and rb@xmath0 species .",
    "for instance the existence of long - range molecular wells @xcite has been decisive in the formation process of cs@xmath0 and rb@xmath0 molecules @xcite .",
    "excited potential curves of @xmath118 and @xmath119 symmetry correlated to the @xmath117 limit are reproduced in figure [ fig : fr2ex ] .",
    "their overall variation is similar to the one for all homonuclear alkali pairs , with for instance a crossing at short distances between the @xmath120 and @xmath121 curves , which gives rise to an avoided crossing when spin - orbit interaction is introduced .",
    "the magnitude of the atomic spin - orbit coupling is reported in the figure , showing that it will be the dominant interaction down to quite short internuclear distances ( @xmath122 ) . assuming that a constant spin - orbit interaction is a reasonably good approximation for @xmath123 ( as it was the case in cs@xmath0 ,",
    "see for instance ref.@xcite ) , we can diagonalize the electronic hamiltonian including spin - orbit ( also given in ref.@xcite ) , yielding the curves reported in figure [ fig : fr2so ] . in contrast with the cs@xmath0 @xcite and rb@xmath0 @xcite molecules , the spin - orbit interaction is so strong in francium that it dominates the electrostatic interaction over a range of internuclear distances such that it prevents the occurence of long - range potential wells in the @xmath124 and @xmath125 symmetries , resulting respectively from the interaction between the @xmath126 and @xmath127 states , and between the @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 states .",
    "for the same reason , the expected avoided crossing generated by the interaction between the @xmath120 and @xmath121 states is no more well localized so that the resulting @xmath131 curves are almost uncoupled .",
    "the photoassociation rate for cold francium atoms can be estimated by comparison with the cesium one , assuming that similar experimental conditions could be achievable . following the model developed in ref.@xcite",
    ", we consider a pa transition close to an atomic d line .",
    "the photoassociation rate @xmath132 is then proportional to the product of characteristic constants @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the wavelength of the d transition , @xmath7 the reduced mass of the atom pair , @xmath135 the effective long - range coefficient of the pa state , and @xmath136 the radiative lifetime of the d line",
    ". then the ratio of pa rates is estimated according to :    @xmath137    where the effective @xmath135 coefficient for francium has been roughly estimated @xcite from the atomic lifetime of the d2 line @xcite .",
    "equation [ eq : ratio ] results in a factor of about 0.7 , meaning that pa is expected to be almost as efficient in francium than in cesium . on the other hand",
    ", the absence of double - well potential , or of a significant interaction between the two @xmath131 curves ( labelled as resonant coupling in ref.@xcite ) will probably prevent the efficient formation of cold francium dimers in deeply bound levels of the ground state or of the lowest triplet state ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a full description of these mechanisms ) , leaving molecules only in the uppermost bound vibrational levels . moreover , the van der waals coefficient of ground state francium @xmath1385226 a.u . is smaller than the one of cesium @xmath1396851 a.u.@xcite .",
    "the corresponding dimer potential curves have a shorter range , which also does not favor the stabilization of long - range pa molecules by radiative decay towards these states .",
    "the excited potential curves correlated to the two lowest @xmath140 dissociation limits in rbfr and csfr are drawn in figure [ fig : mfrex ] , as obtained with @xmath7420.38  a.u . , and with basis b and b for rb and cs .",
    "in contrast with all other the mixed pairs , the smallest excitation energy is now for the lightest atom , which is another characteristic which illustrates the unusual character of the francium atom compared to the rest of the alkali series . in rbfr",
    ", the spin - orbit is expected to strongly mix both @xmath141 and @xmath142 asymptotes ( see the dashed and dotted boxes in figure [ fig : mfrex ] , which can not be represented by the perturbative approach employed for fr@xmath0 , and multiple - well structures may probably be expected .",
    "the csfr asymptotes are more spaced than in rbfr , so that the perturbative approach may be valid at large distances , but strong mixing will probably occur at short interatomic distances .",
    "the van der waals coefficients for these systems , @xmath1434946 a.u . and @xmath1445968 a.u .",
    "have the same magnitude than the rbcs one @xmath1455663 a.u.@xcite , so that the stabilization of pa molecules by radiative decay should be as efficient as in rbcs @xcite .",
    "finally we present in figure [ fig : mfrtran ] the transition dipole moments between the ground state and the first excited @xmath146 states and @xmath147 in francium compounds . here",
    "also results are equivalent when using basis a or basis b and b for rb and cs respectively . in the upper panel , one sees that the rbfr and csfr dipole moments for the transition towards the lowest @xmath148 excited state are superimposed onto the fr@xmath0 function between 7 and 12@xmath96 , suggesting that in this range , the electrons are closer to the francium cores confirming the discussion about permanent dipole moments above .",
    "the same pattern is observable in panel b as well , but over a shorter range ( 8 to 10 @xmath96 ) .",
    "the presence of a strong avoided crossing between the @xmath147 states in rbfr and csfr is visible here as the two transition dipole moment functions cross each other at the position of the avoided crossing .",
    "in this work we investigated the possibility to create cold fr@xmath0 , rbfr , and csfr molecules through photoassociation of cold atoms . indeed , the creation of dense samples of cold francium atoms may become available experimentally , as well as the mixing with cold rubidium or cesium atoms .",
    "we predict that under comparable experimental conditions , photoassociation of cold francium atoms should be as efficient as with cold cesium atoms .",
    "in contrast the formation of ultracold fr@xmath0 molecules will probably be weaker as the formation processes known in cs@xmath0 , relying on the presence of long - range potential wells or resonant coupling , are not expected in fr@xmath0 .",
    "however , the formation of ultracold rbfr or csfr molecules is probably as efficient as in rbcs , which could be worthwhile to try experimentally as dense cold rb and cs samples are widely available .    to extract these results",
    ", we performed the first calculations of the electronic structure of the fr@xmath0 , rbfr , and csfr molecules , yielding potential curves , permanent and transition dipole moments .",
    "a new scalar ( ie spin - orbit averaged ) pseudopotential has been determined to represent the interaction of the valence electron with the large fr@xmath1 core complemented with core - polarization operators . through a comparison with the closest heavy alkali dimers",
    "rb@xmath0 , cs@xmath0 and rbcs , we found that our results yield a realistic representation of the fr@xmath0 , frcs and frrb molecules",
    ". it would be interesting to check the present results with two - component pseudopotential configuration interaction schemes @xcite , but they only exist in the framework of small core pseudopotential ( ie 10 valence electrons or more in he case of francium .",
    "this would allow in particular to estimate errors of the present calculation which ignore spin - orbit induced polarization effects .",
    "however , we provided a description of the molecular fine structure via an empirical atom - in molecules schemes , which suggests that the behaviour of excited fr@xmath0 molecular states involved in photoassociation and cold molecule formation is different from rb@xmath0 and cs@xmath0 cases . here again , it would be interesting to compare with more refined ab initio spin - orbit calculations which are in progress .",
    "an interesting conclusion of the present work is that , while the nature and the quantitative behaviour of the ground state and metastable triplet state potential curves of the francium compounds are generally comparable with other previously studied alkali diatomics , the ground state polarity of hetero - atomic molecules can not be extrapolated from the other alkali pairs , due to the influence of relativistic effect which affect atomic properties , especially the ionization potential(correlated with the outer @xmath13 orbital radius ) .",
