    "in recent years , @xmath0 theories of gravity have gained much attention as promising candidates to overcome the issues posted by dark energy in the standard cosmological model ( c.f .",
    "reference @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "there has been a stimulating debate in their study , leading us to a number of interesting results , particularly in the context of exact solutions .",
    "due to the highly non - linear nature of the @xmath0-field equations , finding exact solutions is indeed a difficult task .",
    "following astrophysical motivations , solutions with spherical symmetry have been the most widely studied @xcite .",
    "however , there has also been a growing interest in finding exact solutions with cylindrical symmetry @xcite . to the best of the authors knowledge ( except for @xcite ) , there is no fully integrated , explicit and exact axially symmetric solution of @xmath0-gravity .    in this paper",
    ", we consider static vacuum solutions of @xmath0 theories in weyl coordinates .",
    "in particular , we obtain the explicit dependence of @xmath1 upon the coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "this in turn , allows us to get the corresponding explicit form of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we analyze in detail the solutions of the modified field equations corresponding to the schwarzschild solution in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the @xmath0 action is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant , @xmath8 is the curvature scalar and @xmath9 is the matter lagrangian .",
    "the field equation resulting from this action are @xmath10 where the ` gravitational ' stress - energy tensor is @xmath11 and @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the stress - energy tensor obtained from the matter lagrangian @xmath16 in the action ( [ eq : action ] ) .",
    "equivalently , we can write ( [ eq : fe ] ) in the form @xmath17 taking the trace of this expression we obtain the relation between @xmath0 and its derivative @xmath18 @xmath19    we are interested in the static axially symmetric solutions of ( [ eq : mfe ] ) . to this end , let us consider the weyl- lewis - papapetrou metric in cylindrical coordinates is @xcite @xmath20\\label{eq : metric},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are continuous functions of @xmath5 and @xmath3 . using the trace equation ( [ eq : contrac ] ) ,",
    "the modified einstein field equations ( [ eq : mfe ] ) become @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the non - zero components of the ricci tensor are    @xmath25    [ eq : ricci ]    while a straightforward computation of the curvature scalar yields @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the usual laplace operator in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "from ( [ eq : modified ] ) and ( [ eq : ricci ] ) we obtain the following system of equations :    @xmath28 & = b,\\\\ \\frac{1}{g_{11 } } \\left [ f_rr_{11 } - 8\\pi gt_{11}^{\\text m}\\right ] & = b,\\\\ \\frac{1}{g_{22 } } \\left [ f_rr_{22 } - 8\\pi gt_{22}^{\\text m}\\right ] & = b,\\\\ \\frac{1}{g_{33 } } \\left [ f_rr_{33 } - 8\\pi gt_{33}^{\\text m}\\right ] & = b,\\\\ f_rr_{23 } - 8\\pi gt_{23}^{\\rm m } -   f_{r,23 } & = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this allows us to write down the independent field equations , i.e.    @xmath29,\\label{eq : meen}\\\\ \\lambda_{,\\rho }   = & \\",

    "for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the vacuum case , i.e. we make    @xmath30    [ eq : meevac ]    one can see that equation ( [ eq : integrab ] ) is the integrability condition for @xmath22 . note that for an arbitrary @xmath0 , the system may become inconsistent .",
    "therefore , we look for the class of functions @xmath0 compatible with .",
    "it is an easy exercise to prove that @xmath31 thus , substituting ( [ eq : boxf_r ] ) in ( [ eq : f(r ) ] ) and using ( [ eq : r ] ) we obtain @xmath32 , \\label{eq : f(r)exp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33    in order to obtain some analytical solutions to the system ( [ eq : meevac ] ) , we need to make some further simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , suppose that it is possible to write @xmath34 then , substituting back into ( [ eq : integrab ] ) we have @xmath35 \\nonumber\\\\= \\left(v\\frac{dv}{dz}\\right)^{-1}\\left[v\\frac{d^3v}{dz^3}-\\frac{d^2v}{dz^2}\\frac{dv}{dz}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equating each side to a separation constant , @xmath36 , we obtain the third order pair of ordinary differential equations    @xmath37=l^2\\label{eq : sep1}\\\\ \\left(v\\frac{dv}{dz}\\right)^{-1 } \\left[v\\frac{d^3v}{dz^3}-\\frac{d^2v}{dz^2}\\frac{dv}{dz}\\right]=l^2 .",

    "one can solve this immediately to obtain @xmath40 which has the solution @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are integration constants .",
    "now , one can easily show that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an arbitrary constant , is solution of ( [ eq : sep2 ] ) if both , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , satisfy the condition @xmath47 thus , we have that some possible solutions for @xmath18 are [ c.f . equation ]    1 .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 . in this case",
    "@xmath50 2 .",

    "@xmath52 3 .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath53 . in this case",
    "@xmath54    consequently , by substituting ( [ eq : fr1 ] ) [ or ( [ eq : fr2 ] ) ] in ( [ eq : f(r)exp ] ) and using we obtain that @xmath0 must satisfy the consistency condition @xmath55 whose solution is simply @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an arbitrary constant .    substituting ( [ eq : fr2 ] ) in both , equations ( [ eq : laplacelambda1 ] ) and ( [ eq : laplacelambda2 ] ) , we have    @xmath58,\\label{eq : lambdarpart}\\\\ & & \\lambda_{,z }   = 2\\rho\\phi_{,\\rho}\\phi_{,z } + bn,\\label{eq : lambdazpart}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq : lambdai ]    respectively .",
    "whereas , by taking @xmath59 we obtain from ( [ eq : f(r)exp ] ) @xmath60,\\label{eq : f(r)3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath61    finally , substituting ( [ eq : fr3 ] ) in ( [ eq : laplacelambda1 ] ) and ( [ eq : laplacelambda2 ] ) , we have    @xmath62,\\label{eq : lambdarpart2}\\\\ \\lambda_{,z }   & = & 2\\rho\\phi_{,\\rho}\\phi_{,z},\\label{eq : lambdazpart2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq : lambdaii ]    respectively .",
    "as we can see from equations ( [ eq : lambdai ] ) and ( [ eq : lambdaii ] ) , the function @xmath22 can be calculated by means of a line integral .",
    "although @xmath63 is a linear differential equation , the equations for @xmath22 manifest the non - linearity of the `` modified '' einstein field equations .",
    "the usual einstein vacuum equations for the static axisymmetric spacetime we have    @xmath64    [ eq : eevac ]    the laplace equation may be solved by using various coordinates in the euclidean 3-space and then the function @xmath22 can be calculated ( c.f . chapter 20 in @xcite ) .",
    "we observe the following points :    1 .",
    "if @xmath65 , then we can obtain a vacuum static axially symmetric solution @xmath66 of the vacuum ` modified ' einstein field equations from the vacuum einstein field equations @xmath67 using the transformation + @xmath68 - \\frac{b^2}{4}\\rho^2 + bnz.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + [ eq : weylmodi ] 2 .   similarly , if @xmath69 we make + @xmath70 \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + [ eq : weylmodii ] + in both cases , @xmath57 is an appropriate constant .",
    "thus , one can say that equations ( [ eq : weylmodi ] ) and ( [ eq : weylmodii ] ) represent a _ weyl class of solutions _ in @xmath0-gravity .",
    "moreover , one can expect that some properties of the curvature of the seed solution will be inherited to the modified ones .",
    "here we present an application of the results obtained in the previous section .",
    "first , we assume a given metric potential , @xmath21 say [ c.f . equation ] , and then we find the other one by means of the two equations @xmath65 , and @xmath59",
    ". let us work in prolate spheroidal coordinates @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "these are related to the cylindrical coordinates @xmath74 through the relations @xmath75 the line element becomes ( c.f . equation ( 4.5.18 ) in @xcite ) @xmath76\\nonumber\\\\    & + m^2 e^{-2\\phi } ( x^2 - 1)(1 - y^2 ) \\d \\varphi^2 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the einstein vacuum equations in @xmath0 gravity for a static axially symmetric space - time can be cast into the form    @xmath77    [ odesys ]    where @xmath78 } \\quad \\text{and } \\quad \\tilde\\lambda=\\frac{1}{2}\\ln{\\left[\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2-y^2}\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the metric potentials corresponding to the usual schwarzschild solution in standard general relativity .",
    "note that we can relate the prolate coordinates @xmath71 to the usual schwarszchild coordinates @xmath79 through the relations ( c.f .",
    "equation ( 4.5.19 ) in @xcite ) @xmath80 this in turn allow us to relate them to by @xmath81\\sin^2(\\theta ) \\quad \\text{and } \\quad z=(r - m)\\cos(\\theta ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it becomes clear that @xmath82 corresponds to @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus , in the forthcoming discussion , the reader should be aware that the domain of the prolate coordinates is defined from the horizon up to infinity .",
    "notice as well that @xmath85 thus , in the same way as the last case , we will obtain a explicit form of @xmath22 by considering the different values of @xmath18 .",
    "here we have    @xmath86    whose solution is @xmath87}\\\\ & + & \\frac{b^2m^2q}{4 } + bmnxy,\\nonumber\\\\ q&=&x^2y^2-x^2-y^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substituting and into the metric , we observe that there are some apparent singularities whenever @xmath88 and @xmath89 take the values @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath91 is not part of the domain of the prolate coordinate system and that the singularities in @xmath89 are the trivial pole singularities when @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the singularity in @xmath83 , however , deserves some deeper analysis . to this end , we compute the two main curvature invariants , i.e. @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath96 and consider the two possibilities , @xmath48 and @xmath97 , separately .",
    "1 .   @xmath48 . in this case , the ricci curvature scalar is r = - , whereas the kretchman invariant takes the form k = - , where @xmath98 is a lesser illuminating expression .",
    "one can easily show that in the large @xmath88 limit , both of the above expressions converge to zero .",
    "moreover , inspecting the @xmath99 solution in the ` equatorial ' plane , @xmath100 , one obtains r_n=1 = 0 and k_n=1= = , in agreement with the schwarszchild solution .",
    "2 .   @xmath51 .",
    "this case is richer in content .",
    "the curvature invariants can be written as r = and k = - . just as before , the functions @xmath101 are long polynomial expressions from which little can be said .",
    "interestingly , a similar analysis of the @xmath99 soution in the @xmath100 plane and taking @xmath102 yields r_n=1 = - and k_n=1 = . here",
    "we observe that the regular behaviour of the @xmath99 solution at the ` horizon ' of the @xmath48 case is lost .",
    "what we see here is a true singularity at @xmath83 with no horizon dressing it .",
    "the behaviour in the vicinity of @xmath83 is shown in figure [ figure1 ] for the soutions with @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104    @xmath105      now , in this case    @xmath106\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the solution is written as @xmath107}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{l^2m^2}{128}[l^2m^2(q+2 ) + 8(2n + 1)]q .",
    "\\label{eq : lambdaschwarzii}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    just as in the previous case , we analyse the curvature invariants to look for singularities .",
    "again , we split our study into two cases    1 .",
    "the curvature invariants are r = - and k = .",
    "same as before , the equatorial plane @xmath99 solution reduces to schwarszchild r_n=1 = 0 and k_n=1 = 32 .",
    "2 .   @xmath109 .",
    "this case shares the same singular structure as the @xmath49 case . as can be seen in figure [ figure2 ] for @xmath110 .",
    "note that for these soutions , @xmath99 is always regular at the horizon .",
    "however , taking @xmath111 always produces a naked singularity at @xmath83",
    ".    finally , let us note that , in every case , the curvature invariants converge to zero in large @xmath88 limit .",
    "the issue of static and axially symmetric solutions in @xmath0-gravity is a timely topic in the context of the exact solutions . in this paper , we have presented an axially symmetric static vacuum solution in weyl coordinates for @xmath0 gravity . in particular , from the integrability condition of one of the metric potentials of the weyl - lewis - papapetrou line element and using the method of separation of variables we have obtained a general explicit expression for the dependence of @xmath1 on the @xmath5 and @xmath3 coordinates and , therefore , the corresponding general explicit form of @xmath0 . working in prolate",
    "spheroidal coordinates , we have analysed in detail the ` schwarzschild ' solution to the modified field equations .",
    "we have shown that these particular static and axially symmetric vacuum solutions of @xmath112 correspond to naked singularities , as can be seen in the right hand column in figures [ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] .",
    "in particular , one observes that the singularity structure of the case @xmath113 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath45 as can be seen in figure [ figure1 ] where the solution ceases to be regular at the horizon and becomes a naked singularity , even in te @xmath99 case .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the potentials ( [ lambda1 ] ) and ( [ eq : lambdaschwarzii ] ) were found by integrating the corresponding system of differential equations [ equations ] .",
    "however , these solutions can be obtained directly by using the transformations and .",
    "this result allows us to generate axially symmetric solutions for @xmath0 from known seeds of the weyl class of solutions for the einstein field equations .",
