    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) has become one of the first mature applications to develop out of the new field of quantum information processing . from the initial ideas of uncloneable quantum money by wiesner @xcite in the 1970 s , to the first concrete qkd protocol ( bb84 ) discovered by bennett and brassard @xcite in 1984 ; qkd has rapidly become a very practical application of quantum information science .",
    "there are now a number of different qkd protocols which have been demonstrated using both optical fibers and free - space optical links as their quantum channel .",
    "some of the more recent free - space experiments include the distribution of entanglement through intra - city free - space links by resch _",
    "_ @xcite and peng _ et al . _",

    "@xcite , and the complete implementation of a free - space qkd system which included all key extraction routines by marcikic _",
    "_ @xcite . for a comprehensive overview of both the theory and different experimental implementations of qkd",
    "please refer to the recent review article by scarani _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "while fiber implementations have produced some of the fastest systems to date , until reliable quantum repeaters are realized , fiber implementations seem to be limited to @xmath3 200 km .",
    "this has prompted increased attention on free - space implementations .",
    "indeed , a number of studies have been performed to evaluate the possibility of performing quantum key distribution with an orbiting satellite such as the international space station @xcite .",
    "therefore , experience with free - space quantum key distribution in a variety of setups and experimental conditions is very valuable for future long distance experiments .",
    "although the unconditional security of many qkd protocols has been shown @xcite , practical implementations are always different from the ideal theory and the possible presence of side channels require that great care is taken when claiming that one has implemented an unconditionally secure quantum key distribution system .",
    "certain assumptions , which are required for the security proofs , are not always met in practice . to that end , we state fully here the assumptions going into the claim of security for our qkd system .    first , to prevent a man - in - the - middle attack",
    ", all classical communications between alice and bob must be authenticated using a short amount of initial secret key for the first few messages and by key generated by the system afterwards .",
    "the key generation process is still efficient because the number of bits needed for authentication is logarithmic in the size of the key @xcite .",
    "we have not implemented authentication in our system yet , but it is under development .",
    "second , as will be shown in the discussion of our results , the detection efficiencies for each of alice s and bob s detectors are not equal .",
    "attacks are known that can exploit a detector inefficiency mismatch @xcite and perhaps leave our system vulnerable to an eavesdropper .",
    "the solution is to carefully equalize the efficiencies of all the detectors without exposing further security loopholes .",
    "we are currently investigating the methods to properly equalize the detector efficiencies .",
    "third , spatial filtering was not used in the polarization detector boxes described below .",
    "it is known that if different detectors see slightly different spatial modes , an eavesdropper could control their relative efficiencies by varying the spatial mode of the input signal @xcite .",
    "however , a significant effort was expended to make the relevant dimensions in the detector box symmetric and identical in order to avoid precisely this kind of attack . strictly speaking this attack",
    "might still be possible , but is assumed to be minimal for our system .",
    "fourth , double clicks , that is when two detectors register a photon at the same time , need to be kept track of and should be assigned a random bit value . for entanglement",
    "based qkd it is unclear whether double pair emissions from the source lead to the same drastic security loophole experienced by weak coherent pulse qkd ; namely , the photon number splitting attack .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to keep track of these events and assign a random measurement result when a double click is observed . in the current system",
    ", we do not explicitly deal with double clicks , but the system will choose whichever event it records first .",
    "this is similar to a random choice within the detector time jitter .",
    "fifth , we make certain assumptions about our detectors , namely that each of the four channels in our detectors are independent and that the dead - time of the detectors is a negligible security concern . the assumption that each of the four channels in our detectors are independent means that the probability of detecting a photon on any channel is independent of whether a photon was previously detected on any other channel . while this is a natural assumption to make ,",
    "it is not always found in practice and depends on the electrical design and physics of the detectors .",
    "additionally , each channel has a certain dead - time after a detection event , in our case 50@xmath4 , where the channel can not detect another photon until it has been reset . to ensure security ,",
    "it is important to reject multiple detection events that fall within the dead - time of the detectors . while these loopholes were not pointed out to us until after the experiment was performed , we assume that their influence on the security of our system is negligible since the rate of detected photons is low enough that any lingering effects of one channel firing should have dissipated before the next channel detection event and the probability of having two detection events in the dead - time window was extremely small .",
    "a data rejection algorithm for multiple events being registered within the dead - time window will be added to future versions of the system .",
    "finally , we assume that the security proof by ma _",
    "@xcite applies to our system , since it is the closest proof to our experimental implementation .",
    "however , it does not precisely encompass our implementation on its own since it assumes the validity of the squashing model of detection and that active basis switching is performed .",
    "however , we can make it apply to our system since the validity of the squashing model for the active basis switching detection scheme has recently been shown @xcite .",
    "additionally , it has also recently been shown that the requirement for active basis switching can be relaxed to include the passive scheme , which is used in this experiment @xcite .",
    "we thus inherit the same two assumptions used in their proof when claiming security for our system .",
    "the assumptions are that we are operating in the long key limit , and that the bit and phase error rates can be assumed to be equal .",
    "preliminary results @xcite suggest that the overhead is indeed dramatic for finite key statistics and many more bits are needed than the formulas in many security proofs suggest .",
    "nevertheless , secure key generation with the rates observed with our system should still be within the realm of possibility .",
    "the proof also makes the simplification that the bit and phase error rates are equal which needs to be carefully examined for our system .",
    "we have built the first real - time implementation of a two free - space link entanglement based quantum key distribution system using the bbm92 protocol invented by bennett _",
    "our system is comprised of a compact spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) source , two free - space telescope links , two compact passive polarization analysis modules , avalanche photodiode ( apd ) single photon detectors , time - stampers , gps time receivers , two laptop computers , and custom written software @xcite .",
    "entangled photon pairs are generated via a compact type - ii spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) source @xcite , which was built on an optical breadboard measuring 61@xmath5 by 46@xmath5 .",
    "a schematic of the source is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.entangledsourceschematic ] .",
    "the source is pumped by a 50@xmath6 , 407.5@xmath7 cw violet diode laser from blue sky research that is focused to an approximate radius of 25@xmath8 in a 1@xmath9 thick @xmath10-bbo crystal .",
    "the down - converted photon pairs at a degenerate wavelength of 815@xmath7 are split off via two small prism mirrors .",
    "an achromatic doublet lens ( f = 150@xmath9 ) collimates the down - converted photons and a half waveplate oriented at @xmath11 plus a 0.5@xmath9 @xmath10-bbo crystal in each arm compensate for longitudinal and transverse walk - off effects .",
    "the angle of one of the compensator crystals is also used to set the relative phase between horizontal and vertical polarizations in order to produce the singlet bell state .",
    "after compensation , the photons are coupled into short singlemode optical fibers using aspheric lenses ( f = 11@xmath9 ) , which can then be coupled either to long singlemode fibers which will carry the photons to the sending telescopes or to local detectors .",
    "the fibers pass through manual polarization controllers which are used to undo the polarization rotation induced by the singlemode fibers .",
    "-bbo nonlinear optical crystal pumped by a blue diode laser .",
    "walk off effects are mitigated with a half waveplate and compensator crystal in each arm .",
    "optional polarizers allow the measurement of the local source visibilities .",
    "the entangled photons are coupled into singlemode fibers and transported to sender telescopes where they are then sent over a free - space link and collected with receiver telescopes .",
    "the photon polarizations are then measured in a passive polarization detector box which uses a 50/50 beamsplitter to perform the basis choice and the proper combination of half waveplates and polarizing beamsplitters to perform the polarization measurement in the correct basis .",
    "[ fig.entangledsourceschematic],width=491 ]    for local alignment , the short singlemode fiber is connected to a singlemode fiber - air - multimode fiber bridge which contains a narrowband spectral filter , centred at 815@xmath7 with a 10@xmath7 bandwidth ( fwhm ) , in order to get rid of any residual laser light and background light before connecting the fibers to apd single photon detectors ( perkinelmer ) .",
    "these are the same filters which are used in the polarization analysis modules .",
    "connecting the fibers to the detectors with this method and inserting the optional polarizers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.entangledsourceschematic ] ) mounted on flip mounts allows us to measure the local quality of the entangled photon source .",
    "typically , we measure a pair rate of 12,000@xmath12 and total single photon count rates on each side of 100,000@xmath12 .",
    "the local entanglement quality is ascertained by measuring the visibility of the source in the rectilinear ( h / v ) basis and the diagonal ( @xmath13/@xmath14 ) basis . for the experimental run detailed in this article we measured visibilities of 99.6% and 91% respectively shortly before the start of the experiment .",
    "this corresponds to a local qber of 2.35% .",
    "the limited visibility in the diagonal basis is likely due to the broad spectral filtering ( 10@xmath7 ) and uncompensated transverse walk - off in the @xmath10-bbo crystal which is aggravated by the narrow pump beam spot .    for an experimental run",
    ", the short singlemode fibers are connected to longer 30@xmath0 singlemode fibers which transport the photons to two telescopes situated in telescope enclosures on top of the ceit building shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.map ] .",
    "the sender telescopes consist of a fiber adapter , which holds the end of the singlemode fiber along the optic axis and allows the light to expand and be collimated by an achromatic doublet lens ( f = 250@xmath9 , d = 75@xmath9 ) into an approximately 50@xmath9 beam .",
    "the fiber adapter is mounted onto a translation stage driven by a high - resolution stepper motor which can adjust the focusing of the telescope .",
    "the same motors are used in the mount which holds the sender telescope to adjust its azimuthal and elevation angles .",
    "all the motors can be controlled remotely from an operator at alice s or bob s location in order to align the sender telescope with the receiver system .",
    "away in an office at the bfg building , and bob located 1,325@xmath0 away in an office at pi .",

    "[ fig.map ] ) .",
    "alice s receiver sits in an office at bfg a free - space distance of 435@xmath0 away from the source .",
    "bob , on the other hand , sits in an office at pi 1,325@xmath0 away from the source .",
    "this produces a total separation of 1,575@xmath0 between alice and bob .",
    "the receiver system consists of a receiver telescope with a passive polarization detector box , that is mounted onto a homemade precision tip / tilt stage for fine adjustment of the receiver s pointing .",
    "the receiver telescope consists of an achromatic doublet lens ( f = 200@xmath9 , d = 75@xmath9 ) and a second small lens ( f = 10@xmath9 , d = 5@xmath9 ) which collimates the photons down into a beam approximately 3@xmath9 in diameter .",
    "the beam then passes through a narrowband spectral filter ( described above ) to remove as much background light as possible and into the passive polarization analysis box shown in the bottom portion of fig .",
    "[ fig.entangledsourceschematic ] .",
    "a 50/50 nonpolarizing beamsplitter performs the basis choice by randomly reflecting or transmitting an incoming photon .",
    "measurement of the photons in the diagonal basis is performed by a half waveplate and a polarizing beamsplitter in the transmitted arm ; while measurement of the photons in the rectilinear basis is performed in the reflected arm with only a polarizing beamsplitter .",
    "the photons are then collected into four multimode fibers with permanently mounted aspheric lenses ( f = 11@xmath9 ) .",
    "tests of the polarization detector boxes revealed the typical leakage of some horizontally polarized photons into the vertical channel at the polarizing beamsplitters which would lead to an increase in the qber rate of up to 1.5% .",
    "the average local qber rate for our source combined with this error in the polarization analysis boxes yields a baseline average qber of 3.85% .",
    "finally , the photons delivered through the four multimode fibers are detected by a quad single photon counting module from perkinelmer which has an approximate detection efficiency of 50% at our wavelength . in order to make the system simpler and",
    "remove the need for a separate timing channel to identify pairs of entangled photons , each photon detection event is time - stamped by units developed by dotfast consulting which have a time resolution of 156.25@xmath15 . since the photon pairs are created at the same time in the @xmath10-bbo crystal , entangled photon pairs correspond to simultaneous detection events after path length differences are taken into account .",
    "accepting only simultaneous detections reduces the background almost to zero .",
    "however , this requirement currently forces us to experiment at night , since the background detection rates experienced during the day both overload our photon detectors and make entangled photon identification with this method infeasible .    at each location",
    ", gps timing units from spectrum instruments provide a highly accurate 10@xmath16 reference signal to the time - stamping units . a one pulse per second ( 1pps ) signal provides a means to continually re - synchronize the electronics at alice s and bob s locations automatically , allowing indefinite stable timing operation of the whole system .",
    "detection data is then passed via a usb connection to a laptop computer at alice s or bob s location , which then performs the classical parts of the bbm92 protocol .    at the beginning of an experiment , alice s and bob s computer clocks",
    "are first synchronized to @xmath3100@xmath17 using a nist timing application @xcite in order to give them a relatively accurate common start time .",
    "a measurement program thread is responsible for continually processing detection events and sending data on to a coincidence thread .",
    "the coincidence thread then exchanges timing information for alice s and bob s detection events in order to identify entangled photon pairs .",
    "a coincidence histogram is calculated to determine the timing offset between alice s and bob s measurements and then coincident detection is performed using a coincidence window of 2@xmath4 in order to identify entangled photon pairs . at this point ,",
    "alice and bob now have raw key data corresponding to entangled photon detection events .",
    "along with the timing information , alice and bob also exchange measurement basis information for each detection event .",
    "this allows the coincidence thread to sift the raw key data down to only those detection events where alice and bob measured in the same basis yielding the sifted key .",
    "all of the classical communication is performed over an ordinary classical internet connection .",
    "ideally , alice and bob would now share identical keys which they could use to encrypt data ; however , due to imperfect state production , transmission , and polarization analysis , not to mention any intervention by an eavesdropper , we expect to see errors in the sifted key .",
    "errors are removed by performing a modified cascade error correction algorithm @xcite on the sifted key .",
    "cascade uses public discussion to compare the parities of randomly chosen blocks from the sifted key and then performs a binary search on any blocks where the parities differ in order to identify and correct the error .",
    "it uses a multi - pass strategy in order to correct all errors with a high probability . during error correction ,",
    "each parity communicated essentially leaks one bit of information to any eavesdropper monitoring the classical communication channel .",
    "the number of bits revealed during error correction is noted so that it can be taken care of in the privacy amplification stage .",
    "the last step is for alice and bob to perform privacy amplification to reduce the amount of information an eavesdropper might possibly know about the key to an exponentially small amount at the cost of reducing the size of their key somewhat .",
    "first , alice and bob must calculate the fraction of their raw , error free key which they will be able to keep after privacy amplification .",
    "the calculation for this comes from the proof of security which most closely matches our physical implementation @xcite .",
    "it bounds an eavesdropper s information as a function of the qber and estimates the necessary key reduction factor using eq .",
    "[ eq.bitrate ] @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the final number of secure bits which alice and bob will have after privacy amplification , @xmath20 is the number of bits after error correction , @xmath21 is the binary entropy function , @xmath22 is the number of bits revealed during error correction , and @xmath23 is an additional safety parameter , which we set to 30 bits in our experiments .",
    "using this reduction ensures that our system is secure both against symmetric individual attacks ( qber @xmath3 14.6% ) and coherent attacks ( qber @xmath3 11% ) ; generating no key if the qber rises above 11% .",
    "note that it is possible to achieve secure key distribution with qber s above 11% but it requires the use of two - way classical post - processing which we do not perform in our system .",
    "thus , the upper limit of secure key generation for our system is a qber of 11% .",
    "alice and bob then perform privacy amplification by applying the 2-universal hash function @xcite shown in eq .",
    "[ eq.privacyamp ] @xmath24 to the raw error corrected key and keeping the last @xmath19 number of bits from the end . here",
    "@xmath25 is the final secure key , @xmath26 is the error corrected key , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are large random numbers ( smaller than @xmath29 ) generated by a random seed shared by alice and bob , and @xmath29 is a large prime number .",
    "alice and bob can verify that they have obtained the same key after these information reconciliation steps by checking the random hash values of their strings many times .",
    "the experiment detailed below was performed on april 28 , 2008 . at the beginning of the experiment ,",
    "the two free - space links were initially aligned with a red laser diode ( 658@xmath7 ) coupled into a singlemode fiber , connected to the sending telescope , and sent over the free - space link .",
    "after the shorter 435@xmath0 bfg link , this produced a spot at the receiver approximately 30@xmath9 in diameter that typically wandered less than 10@xmath9 from its centre .",
    "airy rings were clearly visible in the spot over this shorter distance . the spot produced after the 1325@xmath0 pi link was significantly worse , with a diameter of approximately 100@xmath9 and a typical wander of 50 to 100@xmath9 from its centre .",
    "additionally , airy rings were rarely visible in the spot indicating a significant amount of scintillation in the beam .",
    "a significant amount of the drastic degradation over the longer link can be attributed to the fact that the beam passes over an exhaust vent shortly after leaving the sender telescope .    across the shorter bfg free - space link we received about 29,000@xmath30 from the source , while we received about 10,000@xmath30 from the source across the pi link .",
    "taking into account the detection efficiency of 64% for alice s polarization detector box and 60% for bob s polarization detector box",
    "@xcite , this yields a link transmission efficiency of approximately 45.3% for alice and 16.7% for bob .",
    "the average detection rates for each of alice s and bob s detectors are shown in table [ tab.detectorrates ] including an estimate of the counts due to background light , dark counts , and photons received from the source .",
    ".detection rates for each of alice s and bob s detectors including an estimated breakdown of events due to background light , dark counts of the detectors , and photons received from the source . [ tab.detectorrates ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "lastly , a proof - of - principle bell inequality violation experiment was performed just before the qkd experiment explained in detail above .",
    "over the course of half an hour of data collection we were able to measure an average bell parameter of 2.51 @xmath31 0.11 , almost 5 standard deviations above the classical limit of 2 .",
    "in conclusion , we have implemented the first real - time two free - space link entangled quantum key distribution system including all error correction and privacy amplification algorithms .",
    "the system spans a distance of 1,525@xmath0 with no direct line of sight between alice and bob .",
    "the source is placed between alice and bob with line of sight to each one and takes advantage of the fact that in an entanglement based scheme the source need not be in a trusted location .",
    "the system implements the bbm92 protocol and sends pairs of entangled photons over two separate free - space optical links to be detected by alice and bob and turned into a secure key .",
    "custom software was written to extract entangled photon detection events using a coincidence detection algorithm rather than relying on timing information from a separate classical channel .",
    "over the course of more than six hours of continuous night time operation the system generated an average raw key rate of 565@xmath1 , sifted key rate of 284@xmath1 , and final secure key rate of 85@xmath1 with an average qber of 4.92% .",
