    "an electrorheological ( er ) fluid consists of polarizable particles in a nonconducting host fluid . if an external electric field is applied to an er fluid , the particles aggregate and form chains parallel to the applied field .",
    "these chains may further aggregate to columnlike structures @xcite . to discuss er effect ,",
    "early theory is often based on the point - dipole ( pd ) approximation , e.g. @xcite . also ,",
    "the pd approximation is often adopted in computer simulation @xcite because it is simple and easy to use . since many - body and multipolar interactions between particles have been neglected , the predicted strength of er effect is of an order lower than the experimental results .",
    "hence , much work has been done to sort out more accurate models @xcite .",
    "although those methods are accurate , they are relatively complicated to use in dynamic simulation of er fluids @xcite .    in a recent paper , we put forth the dipole - induced dipole ( did ) model to improve the point - dipole ( pd ) model @xcite . in that work , we considered pair interaction between polarized dielectric particles through the multiple image formula , but neglected the many - body interactions because it was believed that the multipolar interactions can be dominated over the many - body ( local - field ) effects .",
    "the claim was based on the calculation for a pair of particles .",
    "we should really question the quantitative accuracy of this claim , since in er fluids chain and sheet structures are known to occur . in a long particle chain the local field at a dipole site is much larger than for a pair of dipoles , whereas for multipolar interactions this is probably not the case .",
    "in fact , this issue has already been quantified , for particles with large dielectric contrast with the liquid phase , by martin and anderson @xcite .",
    "thus we have to do some additional analysis to validate the claim .    as an initial model",
    ", we may adopt an effective dipole factor in the multiple image formula @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we regard that each polarized particle in an er suspension is embedded in an effective medium with an effective dielectric constant @xmath0 . thus , the usual dipole factor @xmath1 in the multiple image theory should be replaced by @xmath2 @xcite , where @xmath0 is the effective dielectric constant of the surrounding medium , which is conveniently calculated in the maxwell - garnett approximation ( mga ) . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the dielectric constants of the suspended particles and host fluid , respectively .",
    "however , the situation is further complicated by the fact that the suspended particles in an er fluid usually form anisotropic structures , e.g. chain and sheet structures , along the applied field and that @xmath0 can be anisotropic .",
    "thus , @xmath0 should be calculated within the anisotropic mga @xcite .",
    "a preliminary calculation shows that @xmath0 should be increased and @xmath5 should be decreased as compared to @xmath6 . thus the did interaction would be reduced .",
    "but of course the actual reduction should depend on the local - field factor of the anisotropic structures .",
    "thus the many - body effects have been included through the volume - fraction dependent @xmath0 .",
    "so , in the presence of the surrounding particles , the interaction between two particles will be modified . by means of an effective dielectric",
    "constant , we can derive an analytic formula for the many - particle did model . and",
    "more importantly , we can access the importance of the many - body ( local - field ) effects against the multipolar interactions .",
    "we believe this work is necessary because being beyond the fixed dipole model , the previous work dealed with either local - field effects only @xcite or multipolar effects only , but not both .",
    "we concentrate on the case where highly polarized dielectric particles of diameter @xmath7 , dielectric constant @xmath3 are embedded in a host fluid of @xmath4 .    in the dilute limit ,",
    "the dipole factor for an isolated particle may be given by b=. [ b0 ] on the other hand , based on the multiple image method @xcite the dipole factor for a pair of particles with separation @xmath8 has the following form : @xmath9 ^ 3,\\nonumber\\\\ b_l ^*&=&b\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(2b)^n[\\frac{\\sinh \\alpha}{\\sinh ( n+1)\\alpha}]^3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for transverse field ( t ) and longitudinal field ( l ) case , respectively , where @xmath10 satisfies the relation @xmath11 .",
    "when a suspension containing many dielectric particles is subjected to an intense electric field , the induced dipole moments may cause the particles to form chains along the applied field , resulting in complex anisotropic structures . in this case",
    ", we may invoke the maxwell - garnett approximation ( mga ) for anisotropic composites @xcite to obtain the effective dielectric function @xmath0 of the system .",
    "for the transverse field case when the electric field is applied perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis , the mga has the form = f , whereas for a longitudinal field case when the field is applied along the uniaxial anisotropic axis , the mga reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the local field factors perpendicular and parallel to the uniaxial anisotropic axis , and @xmath15 the volume fraction of particles .",
    "these local field factors are defined as the ratio of the local field in the particles to the lorentz cavity field @xcite . for isotropic composites , @xmath16 , while both @xmath17 and @xmath18 will deviate from unity for an anisotropic distribution of particles in composites .",
    "these @xmath19 factors have been evaluated in a tetragonal lattice of dipole moments @xcite and in various field - structured composites @xcite and they satisfy the sum rule @xmath20 in this case , the dipole factor for an individual particle may have this form @xcite b^= , [ b ] note , to obtain this equation , we have replaced @xmath4 in eq.([b0 ] ) with @xmath0 .",
    "that is , we assume the particle to be embedded in an effective medium . thus the many - body ( local - field ) effect is included already in eq.([b ] ) .",
    "so far , to put forth the many - body did model , we may consider a pair of dielectric spheres as well . the spheres are placed in an effective medium .",
    "a constant electric field @xmath21 is applied to the spheres , which contribute to each sphere a dipole moment given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus the multiple image formula can be developed in a similar way @xcite .",
    "the dipole moment @xmath22 induces an image dipole @xmath24 in sphere 2 , while @xmath24 induces yet another image dipole in sphere 1 . as a result",
    ", multiple images are formed .",
    "similarly , @xmath25 induces an image @xmath26 inside sphere 1 , and hence another infinite series of image dipoles are formed .",
    "then we may obtain the sum of dipole moment inside each sphere , and hence the desired expressions for dipole factors : @xmath27 ^ 3\\nonumber\\\\ b ' { } _ l ^{*}&=&b^{'}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(2b^{'})^n[\\frac{\\sinh \\alpha}{\\sinh ( n+1)\\alpha}]^3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for transverse field and longitudinal field case , respectively .",
    "the two equations are nontrivial results indeed , which include the multiple image as well as many - body ( local - field ) effect .    to discuss the interparticle force",
    ", we may take one step forward to calculate the force between two dielectric spheres .",
    "we have already obtained the dipole factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 and hence the dipole moments , and the force can be calculated by an energy approach . in this case , the dipole energy ( @xmath30 ) of a pair of particles may be determined by the dot product of dipole moment and the electric field , and hence the force between a pair of particles is given by the derivative of dipole energy with respect to separation , namely @xmath31 .",
    "so , based on this relation , we may obtain the expressions for interparticle forces , respectively : @xmath32 with = , where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) indicates the interparticle force between a pair of particles in fluid host for transverse ( longitudinal ) field case , and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) in an effective medium for transverse ( longitudinal ) field case .",
    "it is shown that the multipolar effect as well as many - body effects have been taken into account .",
    "setting @xmath37 up to @xmath38 will yield directly the point - dipole forces , namely @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "so far , we have put forth many - body did model .",
    "we are now in a position to do some numerical calculations to discuss the @xmath19 effect on reduction factor @xmath41 , which indicates the correction of the many - body ( local - field ) effect on the multiple image effect , as well as on the ratio of @xmath42 or @xmath28 to @xmath6 .",
    "then , to investigate such effect on interparticle force , we also investigate the interparticle force normalized by point - dipole force .",
    "for numerical calculations , we choose @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the dielectric constant of free space . from the numerical calculations , we find that a domination of the multipolar interactions is possibly over the many - body ( local - field ) effects . more precisely , in fig.1 , for the transverse field case , the correction due to the local - field effect is always small , because the reduction factor is close to unity .",
    "however , for the longitudinal field case , it is evident that the local - field effect can be large , especially at high volume fractions and/or large @xmath17 . in which case ,",
    "the correction due to local field can not be neglected . in fig.2 , we compute the ratio of @xmath42 or @xmath28 to @xmath6 versus the local field factor @xmath17 for different volume fractions . in fig .",
    "3 , we discuss the dependence of @xmath17 on the interparticle force normalized by point - dipole force for different volume fractions . from figs.2 and 3 , it is obvious that the multipolar interactions can indeed be dominant over the dipole interaction , while the local - field effect may yield an important correction .",
    "the force expression is reasonable , as the @xmath48 term of eq.(8 ) vanishes while the @xmath49 term gives the correct dipole interaction force @xmath50 dependence .",
    "the divergence of the summation may be found for the longitudinal field case , due to the small distance @xmath46 being used .    from the results ,",
    "it is clear that the correction due to many - body ( local - field ) effects can be very large , especially at large volume fractions .",
    "nevertheless , for small volume fractions , the correction due to the local field can be neglected .",
    "the reduction of the magnitude of the effective interaction between two particles can be understood in a simple geometry in which the two particles interact in the presence of a third particle .",
    "an average over all possible positions of the third particle gives the desired reduction which is valid both for longitudinal and transverse fields .",
    "so , we believe our results are correct .",
    "here a few comments are in order .",
    "the er effect arises from the polarization forces produced by a mismatch in the dielectric constants of the disperse and continuous phases .",
    "typical er fluids contain a disperse phase with volume fractions in the range of @xmath51 . in this sense",
    ", it is reasonable to set @xmath52 in our calculations . on the other hand",
    ", we set @xmath44 , which is actual value for silicon oil and commonly employed as the host fluid . also , the disperse phases are generally composed of solid , nonconducting , or semiconducting materials with dielectric constants in the range @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the choice @xmath43 is reasonable in our numerical calculations .",
    "in addition , the longitudinal local field factor @xmath17 should satisfy @xmath54 , in order to ensure that @xmath55 .",
    "regarding the separation between the pair of particles , various different values have been used as well , e.g. @xmath56 etc . , and",
    "similar results are obtained ( not shown here ) . however , for the case where the separation is too large , e.g. @xmath57 , the multiple image effect will become small enough to be neglected @xcite .",
    "our many - body did model may be used in various studies of the behavior of er fluids , e.g. , in a theory describing the ground state of er solids or in a computer simulation of er fluids . by including the many - body effects",
    ", the did model can be used with a higher accuracy .",
    "lastly , it is straightforward to extend our model to deal with polydisperse er fluids , and to discuss the magnetorheological suspensions .    in summary",
    ", we have developed a many - body did model by including the many - body ( local - field ) effect , to compute the interparticle force for an er fluid .",
    "we applied the formalism to a pair of touching spherical particles embedded in an effective medium , and calculated the force as a function of the longitudinal local - field factor .",
    "the result show that the multipolar interactions can indeed be dominant over the dipole interaction , while the local - field effect may yield an important correction , especially at larger volume fractions .",
