    "recently much effort has gone into attempts to reproduce observed transition form factors over a large range of four - momentum transfer . at low four - momentum transfer , or @xmath4 , the focus has been on incorporating relativistic effects into the constituent quark model ( cqm )  @xcite , using light - front  @xcite and other  @xcite approaches . at higher @xmath4 , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) sum rule calculations  @xcite and valence pqcd  @xcite",
    "have been employed .",
    "the applicable range in @xmath4 for these various approaches is not clear .    among the most interesting of baryon case studies",
    "is the @xmath3 resonance , which is one of the most strongly excited states over all @xmath4 , and which is easily isolated because it is the only resonance that has a large branching fraction to the @xmath8 .",
    "the reproduction of the @xmath3 form factor has become a goal of many models , but the effort has been hampered by a lack of precise electroproduction data .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty in the @xmath3 transition amplitude is limited by knowledge of the full width and branching fraction to the @xmath8 .",
    "we report here on a measurement of the reaction @xmath9 and an extraction of the helicity - conserving transition amplitude @xmath10 at @xmath1 and 3.6  ( gev@xmath2 . we also use a recent analysis of inclusive @xmath11 data to put a lower bound on the @xmath6 branching fraction .",

    "the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) , which is a resistive @xmath12 device , was used to detect electrons .",
    "the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) , which is a superconducting @xmath13 spectrometer , was used to detect protons .",

    "the sos detectors are configured similarly .",
    "the incident electrons had energies @xmath14 and 4.045  gev for the @xmath1 and 3.6  ( gev@xmath2 points , respectively . at each of the two @xmath4 points ,",
    "the electron spectrometer was fixed in angle and momentum , thus defining a central three - momentum transfer @xmath15 and direction of a boosted decay cone of protons .",
    "the proton spectrometer was stepped in angle and in momentum to capture as much of this decay cone as possible .",
    "data were obtained at 33 ( 21 ) kinematic settings at the low ( high ) @xmath4 point .",
    "target protons were provided in the form of liquid hydrogen at 19  k flowing through a target of length 4.36  cm .",
    "the relative current of the electron beam was measured by two resonant - cavity current monitors , which were calibrated periodically using the absolute beam current measurement of a parametric current transformer .",
    "the combined measurement had an absolute accuracy of .",
    "electrons were identified in the sos using the erenkov detector and lead - glass calorimeter ( see figure  [ fig : sospid2d ] ) . in the hms , protons were separated from pions using the time of flight measured between two pairs of scintillator arrays ( see figure  [ fig : cointime2d ] ) . in both spectrometers , tracking information was obtained from the drift chambers .",

    "the differential cross section was then given by the ratio of experimental to simulated yield in each ( @xmath17 , @xmath27 , @xmath22 ) bin , normalized by the simulation resonance cross section for that bin .",
    "the cross sections obtained using the different @xmath24 models and the two background subtraction techniques all agreed within @xmath30% ; both the following figures and our final results were obtained using the first subtraction technique together with a background generated by combining two of the @xmath24 models .",
