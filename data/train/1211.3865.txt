    "one of the key features of strongly correlated electron systems is their zero temperature behavior where quantum fluctuations have the dominant role to classify different novel phases which are separated by quantum phase transitions @xcite . in this case ,",
    "ground state ( gs ) is the sole candidate which receives drastic changes at qcp driven by some external parameters .",
    "identification of qcps is always a challenging task specially when quantum correlations diminish a single - particle picture .",
    "within last couple of years different measures of quantum entanglement have been proposed to be a new toolkit to detect and categorize qcps @xcite .",
    "recently , ground state fidelity  the overlap of ground state at two slightly different values of coupling constants  has attracted intensive attention as a proper quantity to signal qcp without the need to know the structure of phases close to phase transition @xcite .",
    "an abrupt drop of fidelity in the vicinity of qcp is a consequence of an essential change in the structure of gs which is usually accompanied with a divergence of fidelity susceptibility .",
    "meanwhile , it is rather difficult to obtain the gs of a strongly correlated many body system .",
    "however , recent successful attempts to calculate some measures of entanglement @xcite by quantum renormalization group ( qrg ) approach @xcite lead to a unified formalism @xcite to obtain fidelity in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath1 ) without knowing the gs of a large system .",
    "it suggests to implement qrg for obtaining the renormalization of fidelity for the bond alternating ising model with dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction .",
    "dm interaction @xcite which roots to the spin - orbit coupling is the antisymmetric super - exchange which leads to helical magnetic structures as the most likely candidates to host ferroelectricity @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the quantum critical behavior of the one dimensional bond alternating ising model with dm interaction in terms of renormalization of fidelity .",
    "the model represents an antiferromagnetic ( nel ) long range order for small dm interaction while it undergoes via a continuous phase transition to a helical ordered phase .",
    "the ground state in the nel phase is a product state which has essentially zero quantum entanglement and nonzero staggered magnetization while the helical phase poses a correlated quantum ground state with zero staggered magnetization . within a classical picture",
    "the helical phase could be assumed as slightly rotating spins along the direction of chain . in terms of landau theory of critical phenomena",
    "the staggered magnetization could be chosen as the proper order parameter .",
    "we have shown that the divergence in fidelity susceptibility ( fs ) at the qcp is an appropriate signature to find qcp which is more pronounced than the second derivative of ground state energy @xcite .",
    "the presented scheme makes us to find the critical points and its corresponding exponents more accurately .",

    "@xmath7 is the vector of dm interaction which is considered in @xmath8-direction , i.e. @xmath9 . to apply qrg @xcite ,",
    "the spin chain is decomposed to three - sites blocks ( see fig.[blocks ] ) where the intra - block hamiltonian is @xmath10 and the inter - block one is @xmath11 and their sum defines the whole hamiltonian , @xmath12 ( see the bottom part of fig.[blocks ] ) . in this respect",

    "the presence of bond alternation imposes to consider two types of blocks as depicted in fig.[blocks ] , namely even and odd which are the mirror image of each other . for even blocks we find similar eigenstates by replacing @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    ) and",
    "inter - block one ( @xmath11 ) are represented schematically in the bottom part.,height=102 ]    the global embedding operator is the direct product of the embedding operator of each block , @xmath36 which gives the renormalized hamiltonian by @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the renormalized hamiltonian is similar to the original one , eq.[eq1 ] , while the coupling constants are replaced with the renormalized one ( denoted with @xmath38 ) as given in the following equations , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "these relations , eq.[rgflow ] , define the qrg - flow of our model which will be used in next sections and their features will be discussed in sec.[summary ] .",
    "we implement the formalism introduced in @xcite to calculate the ground state fidelity in terms of quantum renormalization group . according to the qrg - flow ( eq.[rgflow ] )",
    ", @xmath0 does not run within the qrg iterations which hints to study the quantum phase transition by variation of @xmath41 .",
    "the fidelity ( f ) associated to the ground states @xmath42 for a system of size @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a small deviation around @xmath41 . according to the renormalization group approach @xmath47",
    "in which @xmath48 is the global embedding operator and @xmath49 is the ground state of the renormalized hamiltonian .",
    "thus , fidelity can be written in terms of renormalized ground state , @xmath50 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath51 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for both even and odd types of blocks where @xmath52 is the identity operator .",
    "therefore , the first qrg iteration leads to @xmath53 , where fidelity of the original model is expressed in terms of fidelity of the renormalized one , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "it defines the renormalization of fidelity in terms of qrg .",
    "the qrg procedure is iterated @xmath55-times to reach the renormalized system of @xmath56 and the ground state fidelity is expressed by @xmath57 where @xmath58 has the same expression as given in eq.[r0 ] for @xmath59 in which @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are calculated at the @xmath4-th qrg iteration and @xmath63 is the fidelity of a single block with three sites and @xmath55-times renormalized couplings .",
    "we have plotted fidelity ( eq.[frg ] ) versus @xmath41 in fig.[fs]-(left ) for different chain length ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath64 and at @xmath65 . by definition ,",
    "fidelity is bounded by @xmath66 and an abrupt drop is a signature of quantum phase transition . we observe a sharp drop in fig.[fs]-(left ) for @xmath67 which manifests that the ground state has encountered an essential change . the deep of drop is enhanced as the system size is increased which justifies an unfailing drop in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this signature of quantum phase transition is more pronounced in the fidelity susceptibility ( fs ) which is the leading nonzero term in the expansion of fidelity and shows the change rate of fidelity , i.e. @xmath68 .",
    "thus , fs is obtained by the following relation @xmath69 fig.[fs]-(right ) presents @xmath70 versus @xmath41 for various system sizes , @xmath64 and at @xmath65 .",
    "a maximum appears in @xmath71 which is increased by the size of system representing a divergence in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the position of @xmath72 is exactly at the point where fidelity receives a drop .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the fidelity susceptibility at the quantum critical point obeys a scaling relation . the scaling analysis for finite system size ( @xmath43 )",
    "states @xmath73 is the position of maximum in fs and @xmath74 is the critical exponent governing the divergence of correlation length .",
    "the analysis of data of fig.[fs]-(right ) is presented as an inset to this figure .",
    "it clearly verifies that the scaling relation eq.[scaling ] is satisfied with @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , we have obtained similar behavior for different values of @xmath0 ( not presented here ) where the critical point is found to be a function of bond alternating parameter , @xmath77 while @xmath78 is the same for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to what stated in ref.@xcite the critical exponent which we got does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "it means that the whole phase boundary for @xmath79 belongs to the same universality class of a second order phase transition .",
    "we have implemented the quantum renormalization group approach to study the zero temperature phase diagram of bond alternating ising chain in the presence of dm interaction . to get a self similar hamiltonian two types of blocks with 3-sites",
    "have been considered which leads to the qrg - flow equations of eq.[rgflow ] .",
    "the qrg - flow tells that @xmath0 does not vary within qrg procedure while @xmath41 is renormalized . to get the phase diagram of the model we have calculated the renormalization of ground state fidelity which has been developed recently @xcite .",
    "fidelity as a geometric quantity @xcite shows how much the ground state encounters an essential change by slightly moving in the parameter space .",
    "therefore , a sharp drop of fidelity versus a control parameter is a signature of quantum phase transition .",
    "the renormalization of fidelity obtained in eq.[frg ] in addition to qrg - flow , eq.[rgflow ] give the fidelity of our model for very large system sizes without the need to get the ground state . a clear drop of fidelity versus @xmath41 in fig.[fs]-(left ) and consequently a maximum in the fidelity susceptibility , fig.[fs]-(right ) , verifies the existence of a quantum phase transition at @xmath80 .",
    "we have applied the finite size scaling on the susceptibility data presented in the inset of fig.[fs]-(right ) for @xmath65 and generally got the critical phase boundary @xmath81 . the phase boundary which separates the antiferromagnetic ( af ) nel order from a helical order is shown by the blue line in fig.[phase - diagram]-(right ) .",
    "however , our scaling analysis gives a single value for the correlation length exponent @xmath82 ( independent of @xmath0 ) for the whole phase boundary which is in contrast to @xcite .",
    "although the presence of bond alternation breaks the translation invariance of the hamiltonian it does not change the symmetry of the ground state which has already been spontaneously broken due to antiferromagnetic long range order .",
    "a comparison of our results with @xcite concludes that the bond alternation does not change the universality class of the model as far as @xmath83 .",
    "we calculate the staggered magnetization ( sm ) and helical order parameter which is presented in fig.[phase - diagram]-(left ) .",
    "staggered magnetization is defined by @xmath84 which can be expressed in terms of the renormalized ground state by replacing @xmath47 .",
    "we use the projection of spin operators into the renormalized hilbert space which finally leads to @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the staggered magnetization of the renormalized chain . a large number of iterations of eq.[smrg ] give the staggered magnetization in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "similarly , the helical order parameter ( @xmath87 ) is defined by the following relation @xcite @xmath88 which can be calculated using the qrg - flow . in this respect , @xmath87 is expressed in terms of the helical order parameter in the renormalized model ( @xmath89 ) by the following relation @xmath90 the above equation is iterated by replacing the couplings with the renormalized ones to reach the stable thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have plotted both staggered magnetization and helical order parameter versus @xmath41 in fig.[phase - diagram]-(left ) for three values of @xmath91 and @xmath1 . for @xmath92 , @xmath93 is at its saturated value @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the onset of nonzero @xmath41 induces a helical order on the spins in the presence of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the increase of @xmath41 reduces the antiferromagnetic order and enhances @xmath87 ( helical order ) .",
    "exactly at the quantum critical point @xmath80 , @xmath93 vanishes and remains zero for @xmath96 while @xmath87 saturates to a finite amount which is less than its maximum attainable value .",
    "similar behavior has been observed for all @xmath79 while the saturated value of @xmath87 is slightly decreased by increase of @xmath0 .    to complete the phase diagram",
    "let us concentrate on the @xmath92 axis ( fig.[phase - diagram]-(right ) ) . at @xmath97",
    "the model is simply an antiferromagnetic ising chain with nel order @xmath98 and the ground state energy is @xmath99 . for @xmath100",
    ", there are two types of couplings @xmath101 and @xmath102 which are positive and induce the previous nel order and ground state energy . exactly at @xmath103 , the weak interaction @xmath101 becomes zero and the spin model decomposes to @xmath104 independent pairs of antiferromagnetically coupled spins .",
    "the ground state energy is still @xmath99 while the ground state is exponentially degenerate , namely @xmath105 .",
    "the degeneracy arises from the pairs which are decoupled .",
    "for instance , @xmath98 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are examples of different configurations which is possible for the ground state .",
    "the entropy ( s ) is proportional to @xmath108 which leads to @xmath109 .",
    "this high amount of entropy at @xmath103 is a signature of a phase transition which is actually of first order .",
    "meanwhile , for @xmath110 one of the interactions becomes ferromagnetic , @xmath111 and the other @xmath102 is still antiferromagnetic which totally leads to @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the derivative of @xmath113 with respect to @xmath0 receives a discontinuity at @xmath103 . the ground state for @xmath110 is either @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "the first order tri - critical point is represented by the filled black circle in fig.[phase - diagram]-(right ) and the ferro - antiferromagnetic ground state is denoted by the red line for @xmath110 .    * acknowledgments * we would like to thank a. t. rezakhani for fruitful discussions .",
