    "we present a stochastic model for a social network @xcite , where new actors may join the network , existing actors may become inactive and , at a later stage , may reactivate themselves .",
    "our model captures the evolution of the network , assuming that actors attain new relations or become active according to the preferential attachment rule .",
    "the concept of _ preferential attachment _ , originating from @xcite , has become a common theme in stochastic models of networks @xcite .",
    "this behaviour often results in the `` rich get richer '' phenomenon , for example , where new relations to existing actors are formed in proportion to the number of relations those actors currently have .",
    "the model presented incorporates the novel aspect of differentiating between active and inactive actors , and allowing actors status to change between active and inactive over time .",
    "this type of network dynamics is especially relevant to situations where actors may connect / disconnet or login / logout from the network , in particular , when network registration is needed as a prior condition to the first time an actor connects to the network .",
    "the network models proposed so far either assume that all actors are active , or that when actors leave the network they do not rejoin it @xcite .    by deriving the mean - field equations for this model of a social network ,",
    "we obtain the result that , asymptotically , the distribution of actors obeys a power law .",
    "power - law distributions taking the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are positive constants , are abundant in nature @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath2 is called the _ exponent _ of the distribution .",
    "examples of such distributions are : _ zipf s law _ , which states that the relative frequency of a word in a text is inversely proportional to its rank , _",
    "pareto s law _ , which states that the number of people whose personal income is above a certain level follows a power - law distribution with an exponent between 1.5 and 2 ( pareto s law is also known as the _",
    "80:20 law _ , stating that about 20% of the population earn 80% of the income ) and _ lotka s law _ , which states that the number of authors publishing a prescribed number of papers is inversely proportional to the square of the number of publications .",
    "recently , several researchers have detected power - law distributions in the topology of several networks such as the world - wide - web @xcite , e - mail networks @xcite , collaboration networks @xcite and peer - to - peer networks @xcite .",
    "there are several examples of networks that can be modelled within our formalism .",
    "one example is that of a wireless network @xcite , where mobile users having , e.g. a laptop , pda or mobile phone , connect to access points within a defined region ( e.g. campus , building or airport ) . in this case",
    "the actors are the users and the relations are between users and access points .",
    "the user is active during a connection and otherwise inactive .",
    "another example , is that of a peer - to - peer network @xcite , where users ( referred to as peers ) connect to other peers in order to exchange information .",
    "peer - to - peer networks are of prime importance to the future of the internet , as networks such as bittorrent @xcite , kazaa @xcite and skype @xcite are becoming increasingly popular and thus account for a sizeable amount of all internet traffic .    our stochastic model is based on the transfer of _ balls _ ( representing actors ) between _ urns _ ( representing actor states ) , where we distinguish between active balls in , regular , _ unstarred urns _ and inactive balls in",
    "_ starred urns_. the relationships of a particular actor are represented as _",
    "pins _ attached to the corresponding ball .",
    "we note that our urn model is an extension of the stochastic model proposed by simon in his visionary paper published in 1955 @xcite , which was couched in terms of word frequencies in a text .",
    "previously , in @xcite , we considered an alternative extension of simon s model by adding a preferential mechanism for discarding balls from urns resulting in an exponential cutoff in the power - law distribution .",
    "in the model we present here , at each step of the stochastic process , with probability @xmath3 , two events may happen : either a new active ball is added to the first unstarred urn with probability @xmath4 , or with probability @xmath5 an inactive ball is selected preferentially from a starred urn and is activated by moving it to the corresponding unstarred urn . alternatively , with probability @xmath6 , an active ball is selected preferentially from an unstarred urn and then two further events may happen : it is either moved along to the next unstarred urn with probability @xmath7 , or with probability @xmath8 the selected ball becomes inactive by moving it to the corresponding starred urn .",
    "we assume that a ball in the @xmath9th urn has @xmath9 pins attached to it ( which represents an actor having @xmath9 relations ) .",
    "our main result is that the steady - state distribution of this model is an asymptotic power law , and , moreover , as a proof of concept we demonstrate the validity of our model by analysing data from a real wireless network .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : urn ]",
    "we present an urn transfer model allowing balls to be active or inactive by moving from starred urns to unstarred urns and vice versa .",
    "we then derive in section  [ sec : power - law ] the steady - state distribution of the model , which , as stated earlier , follows an asymptotic power - law distribution . in section  [ sec : param ] we show how we can fit the parameters of the model to data , and in section  [ sec : p2p ] we demonstrate how our model can provide an explanation of the empirical distributions found in wireless networks .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concluding ] we give our concluding remarks .",
    "we now present an _ urn transfer model _ for a stochastic process that emulates the situation where balls ( which might represent actors ) become inactive with a small probability , and can later become active again with some probability .",
    "we assume that a ball in the @xmath9th urn has @xmath9 pins attached to it ( which might represent the actors relations ) .",
    "the model is an extension of our previous model of exponential cutoff @xcite , where balls are discarded with a small probability .",
    "we assume a countable number of ( _ unstarred _ ) urns , @xmath10 and correspondingly a countable number of _ starred _ urns @xmath11 , where the former contains active balls and the latter contain the inactive balls .",
    "initially all of the urns are empty except @xmath12 , which has one ball in it .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be the number of balls in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , at stage @xmath17 of the stochastic process , so @xmath18 , all other @xmath19 and all @xmath20 .",
    "then , at stage @xmath21 of the stochastic process , where @xmath22 , one of two events may occur :    1 .   with probability @xmath3 , @xmath23",
    ", one of two events may happen : 1 .   with probability @xmath4 , @xmath24 , a new ball ( with one pin attached to it )",
    "is inserted into @xmath12 , or 2 .   with probability @xmath5 ,",
    "a starred urn is selected , with @xmath16 being selected with probability proportional to @xmath25 , the number of pins it contains , and a ball is chosen from the selected urn , @xmath16 , and transferred to @xmath15 ( this is equivalent to making the ball active ) .",
    "2 .   with probability @xmath26 an urn",
    "is selected , with @xmath15 being selected with probability proportional to @xmath27 , the number of pins it contains , and a ball is chosen from the selected urn , @xmath15 ; then , 1 .   with probability @xmath7 , @xmath28 , the chosen ball is transferred to @xmath29 , ( this is equivalent to attaching an additional pin to the ball chosen from @xmath15 ) , or 2 .   with probability @xmath30 the ball chosen",
    "is transferred to @xmath16 ( this is equivalent to making the ball inactive ) .",
    "we note that we could modify the initial conditions so that , for example , @xmath12 and @xmath31 initially contained @xmath32 balls , respectively , instead of @xmath12 having just one ball and @xmath31 being empty .",
    "it can be shown , from the development of the model below , that any change in the initial conditions will have no effect on the asymptotic distribution of the balls in the urns as @xmath17 tends to infinity , provided the process does not terminate with either all of the unstarred urns empty or all of the starred urns empty ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the former case",
    "we need to ensure that @xmath33 , i.e. that the number of balls going into unstarred urns is greater than the number of balls going out of unstarred urns . in the latter case",
    "we need to ensure that @xmath34 , i.e. that the number of balls going into starred urns is greater than the number of balls going out of starred urns .",
    "more specifically , the probability of termination must be small , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 for some @xmath37 .",
    "we observe that these are the probabilities that the gambler s fortune will _ not _ increase forever @xcite .",
    "the expected total number of balls in the unstarred urns at stage @xmath17 is given by @xmath38 and in the starred urns by @xmath39    the total number of pins attached to balls in @xmath15 at stage @xmath17 is @xmath27 , so the expected total number of pins in the unstarred urns is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , is the expectation of @xmath43 , the number of pins attached to the ball chosen at step ( ib ) of stage @xmath44 ( i.e. the urn number ) , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , is the expectation of @xmath47 , the number of pins attached to the ball chosen at step ( iib ) of stage @xmath44 ( i.e. the urn number ) .",
    "more specifically , @xmath48 and @xmath49    the quotient of sums in the second expectation in ( [ eq : psi - define ] ) ( respectively in ( [ eq : theta - define ] ) ) , which we denote by @xmath50 ( respectively by @xmath51 ) , is the expected value of @xmath43 ( respectively of @xmath47 ) given the state of the model at stage @xmath52 .",
    "correspondingly , the expected total number of pins in the starred urns is given by @xmath53    since at stage @xmath44 there can not be more than @xmath52 pins in the system , it follows that    @xmath54    now let @xmath55 and @xmath56    since there are at least as many pins ( starred pins ) in the system as there are balls ( starred balls ) , it follows from , ( [ eq : balls ] ) and ( [ eq : pins ] ) , and , ( [ eq : starred - balls ] ) and ( [ eq : starred - pins ] ) , that @xmath57 which implies that @xmath58 is bounded .",
    "this bounded difference will suffice for the purpose of the developments in the next section and we will denote @xmath59 by @xmath60 and @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "following simon @xcite , we now state the mean - field equations for the urn transfer model .",
    "for @xmath63 we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the expected value of @xmath66 given the state of the model at stage @xmath17 , and @xmath67 @xmath68 are the normalising factors .",
    "equation  [ eq : unstarred ] gives the expected number of balls in @xmath15 at stage @xmath21 .",
    "this is equal to the previous number of balls in @xmath15 plus the probability of adding a ball to @xmath15 minus the probability of removing a ball from @xmath15 , and finally plus the probability of transferring a ball to @xmath15 from @xmath16 .",
    "the first probability is just preferentially choosing a ball from @xmath69 and transferring it to @xmath15 in step ( iia ) of the stochastic process defined in section  [ sec : urn ] , the second probability is that of preferentially choosing a ball from @xmath15 in step ( iia ) of the process , and the third probability is that of preferentially transferring a ball from @xmath16 to @xmath15 in step ( ib ) of the process .    in the boundary case , @xmath70 , we have @xmath71    equation  [ eq : initial ] gives the expected number of balls in @xmath12 at stage @xmath21 , which is equal to the previous number of balls in @xmath12 plus the probability of inserting a new ball into this urn in step ( ia ) of the stochastic process defined in section  [ sec : urn ] minus the probability of preferentially choosing a ball from @xmath12 in step ( iia ) , and finally plus the probability of preferentially transferring a ball to @xmath12 from @xmath31 in step ( ib ) of the process .    for starred urns , for @xmath72 , corresponding to ( [ eq : unstarred ] ) and ( [ eq : initial ] ) , we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the expected value of @xmath75 given the state of the model at stage @xmath17 .",
    "equation  [ eq : starred ] gives the expected number of balls in @xmath16 at stage @xmath21 .",
    "this is equal to the previous number of balls in @xmath16 plus the probability of preferentially transferring a ball from @xmath15 to @xmath16 in step ( iib ) of the stochastic process defined in section  [ sec : urn ] minus the probability of preferentially transferring a ball from @xmath16 to @xmath15 in step ( ib ) of the process .    in order to solve the equations of the model , namely ( [ eq : unstarred ] ) , ( [ eq : initial ] ) and ( [ eq : starred ] )",
    ", we make the assumptions that , for large @xmath17 , the random variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be approximated by constants ( i.e. non - random ) values depending only on @xmath17 . to this end",
    "we take the approximations to be    @xmath78    and @xmath79    the motivation for the above approximations is that the denominators in the definitions of @xmath76 and @xmath77 have been replaced by asymptotic approximations of their expectations as given in ( [ eq : pins ] ) and ( [ eq : starred - pins ] ) , respectively .",
    "we note en passant that replacing @xmath76 by @xmath80 and @xmath77 by @xmath81 results in an approximation similar to that of the `` @xmath82 model '' in @xcite , which is essentially a `` mean - field '' approach .",
    "we next take the expectations of ( [ eq : unstarred ] ) , ( [ eq : initial ] ) and ( [ eq : starred ] ) . by the linearity of the expectation operator @xmath83 , we obtain    @xmath84    @xmath85    and @xmath86    in order to obtain an asymptotic solution of ( [ eq : hat1 ] ) , ( [ eq : hat2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hat3 ] ) , we require that @xmath87 and @xmath88 converge to some values @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , as @xmath17 tends to infinity . assume for the moment that this is the case , then , provided the convergence is fast enough , @xmath91 tends to @xmath89 and @xmath92 tends to @xmath90 as @xmath17 tends to infinity . by `` fast enough ''",
    "we mean that @xmath93 and @xmath94 for large @xmath17 , where @xmath95    now , letting @xmath96 we see that @xmath97 tends to @xmath98 as @xmath17 tends to infinity , and letting @xmath99 we see that @xmath100 tends to @xmath101 as @xmath17 tends to infinity .",
    "so , letting @xmath17 tend to infinity , ( [ eq : hat1 ] ) , ( [ eq : hat2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hat3 ] ) yield , for @xmath63 , @xmath102 for @xmath70 , @xmath103 and for @xmath72 , @xmath104 whence @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "hence @xmath109 and thus @xmath110    on using ( [ eq : derive - fi ] ) , repetitively , and ( [ eq : derive - f1 ] ) , the solution to @xmath89 is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 is the gamma function @xcite .",
    "thus for large @xmath9 , on using the asymptotic expansion of the ratio of two gamma functions @xcite , we obtain @xmath115 where @xmath116 means _ is asymptotic to _ and @xmath117    moreover , it can easily be verified from ( [ eq : derive - fi - star ] ) that @xmath118 and , from ( [ eq : fi - approx ] ) and ( [ eq : fi - star ] ) , it follows that @xmath119",
    "in order to validate the model we use the equations we have derived in section  [ sec : power - law ] to fit the parameters of the model . as a first step",
    "we validate the model through stochastic simulation , and then , in section  [ sec : p2p ] , we provide a proof of concept on a real wireless network .    we note that the full set of parameters will , generally , be unknown for real data sets .",

    "we are also able to derive approximations for @xmath120 and @xmath121 , separately , and similarly for pins , based on their definitions in section  [ sec : urn ] .    from the formulation of the model in section  [ sec : urn ] , we have @xmath124 where the right - hand side of ( [ eq : balls - k ] ) is the limiting value of the left - hand side as @xmath17 tends to infinity .",
    "similarly , we have , @xmath125    as a result , we can compute the branching factor , _ bf _ , as @xmath126 which eliminates @xmath17 , and derive @xmath127    the value of the parameter @xmath128 can be computed from @xmath129 which follows from ( [ eq : betak ] ) and the fact that @xmath130 . similarly , @xmath131 can be computed from @xmath132 which follows from ( [ eq : alphak ] ) and the fact that @xmath133 .",

    "we note that we have chosen to do a direct numerical minimisation rather than use a regression tool on the log - log transformation of the urn data and try to fit a power - law distribution , since fitting power - law distributions is problematic @xcite .",

    "as a proof of concept we made use of a public log containing traces of the activity of users within a campus - wide wlan network recorded by the crawdad project ( http://crawdad.cs.dartmouth.edu ) at the center for mobile computing at dartmouth college @xcite . the data set we elected to work with was collected during 2001 - 2003 using the syslog system event logging facility available on the wireless access points .",

    "of particular interest are the following probabilities :    1 .",
    "@xmath176 , which is the rate at which new users join the network and attain their first wireless connection .",
    "2 .   @xmath177 , which is the rate at which inactive users become active again .",
    "3 .   @xmath178 , which is the rate at which active users attain a new wireless connection without first disconnecting from the network .",

    "the output from the simulation is consistent with the parameters mined from the data ; a second simulation with the same input parameters produced similar results .",
    "overall , on the evidence from the computational results , the urn transfer model described in section  [ sec : urn ] , is a viable model for a real social network , specifically for the access patterns of users within the dartmouth wireless network .",
    "we have presented an extension of simon s classical stochastic process where each actor can be either in an active or an inactive state .",
    "actors , chosen by preferential attachment may attain a new relation , become inactive or later become active again .",
    "the system is closed in the sense that once an actor enters the system he remains within the system .",
    "we have shown in ( [ eq : fi - approx ] ) and ( [ eq : fi - star ] ) that , asymptotically , the number of active and inactive actors having prescribed number of relations is a power - law distribution . as a proof of concept we validated the model on a real data set of wireless accesses over a lengthy period of time .",
    "the validation made use of numerical optimisation rather than using standard regression tools , due to the known difficulty of detecting asymptotic power - law distributions in data .",
    "the stochastic model we have presented is relevant to social networks where users may be active or inactive at different times .",
    "two such real - world networks are wireless networks and peer - to - peer networks , although it remains to validate our model on a real peer - to - peer data set .",
