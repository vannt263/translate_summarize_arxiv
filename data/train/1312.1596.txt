    "almost a half century has passed since the original quark model was proposed by gell - mann and zweig in 1964 .",
    "the model suggested that hadrons are classified into two categories , baryons with three quarks and mesons with a quark and an antiquark .",
    "although there were speculations on other hadron configurations , such as tetra - quark hadrons of the @xmath6 configuration and penta - quark hadrons of @xmath7 , which are not forbidden by the fundamental theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , it is rather surprizing that such exotic hadrons have not been found undoubtedly for a long time @xcite .",
    "we are , however , fortunate to start observing some precursory signatures of exotic hadrons , for example z(4430 ) , after so many years of theoretical and experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "there are reports on new findings on heavy hadrons with charm and bottom quarks @xcite .",
    "however , even in the low - mass region of 1 gev , there are controversial hadrons @xmath8 and @xmath5 which could be tetra - quark ( or @xmath9 molecule ) hadrons @xcite , and @xmath10 which could be a penta - quark ( or @xmath11 molecule ) hadron @xcite .",
    "however , internal structure of exotic hadrons is not easily determined by low - energy measurements on global properties such as masses and decay widths . since",
    "similar masses and decay widths could be obtained in ordinary hadron pictures , it is rather difficult to entangle various possibilities on internal configurations .",
    "we propose that internal configurations of exotic - hadron candidates can be determined by high - energy reactions , especially exclusive processes .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy that quark and gluon degrees of freedom appear in the high - energy reactions .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to use high - energy exclusive processes for determining the internal structure of exotic hadrons . there was a proposal to use fragmentation functions for finding the exotic nature by noting the characteristic differences between favored and disfavored fragmentation functions depending on an internal quark configuration @xcite .",
    "for example , the fragmentation functions of an exotic - hadron candidate @xmath12(980 ) could be measured by the kek - b factory @xcite .",
    "we also proposed that the constituent - counting rule in hard exclusive processes should be useful for determining the number of active constituents in exotic hadrons by taking @xmath13 production as an example @xcite .",
    "there are also studies on exotic hadrons by hard electro - production processes @xcite .",
    "such theoretical and experimental studies have not been extensively explored yet at high energies although it could be considered to be a promising future direction of exotic - hadron studies .    on the other hand , internal structure of the nucleon",
    "becomes a new area recently in investigating transverse configuration in addition to the longitudinal partonic structure .",
    "it is the field of  hadron tomography \" to find the three - dimensional ( 3d ) structure of hadrons .",
    "it partly originates from the nucleon - spin puzzle in the sense that transverse structure , namely orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons , needs to be understood because quark and gluon spin contributions are rather small for constituting the spin 1/2 of the nucleon .",
    "these 3d picture of the nucleon has been recently investigated by transverse - momentum - dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) and generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite .",
    "the tmds , especially the unpolarized distributions , are sometimes called unintegrated parton distribution functions ( updfs ) .    these distribution functions contain information on internal configuration of the nucleon .",
    "the longitudinal part contains the information of longitudinal momentum distributions of partons , and the transverse part reflects the transverse size . in this article",
    ", we show that these two ingredients could have information on exotic hadron structure if the gpds are investigated for exotic - hadron candidates .",
    "we also suggest that generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) , which are investigated in the @xmath14-@xmath15 crossed process to the gpd one , should be appropriate quantities for determining the internal structure of exotic hadrons . here",
    ", @xmath14 and @xmath15 are mandelstam variables .",
    "the gdas can be investigated in @xmath16 collisions and there are available @xmath17 colliders in the world including the high - luminosity kek - b factory for such gda studies . the two - photon physics has been studied for investigating hadron properties @xcite , and it can be now used for the gda studies .    this article is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ description ] , definitions of the gpds and gdas are explained by starting from the basic function of the wigner distribution for a hadron .",
    "then , possible longitudinal momentum distributions and form factors are explained for exotic hadrons .",
    "then , the formalism is shown for calculating exclusive cross sections for @xmath18 to investigate internal structure of exotic hadron candidates by the gdas .",
    "numerical results are shown in sec .",
    "[ results ] , and they are summarized in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "we explain the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) and generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) of hadrons for investigating internal structure of exotic hadron candidates . as an example of actual high - energy reaction processes ,",
    "an electron - positron annihilation is explained for investigating the exotic gdas by exclusive production processes from @xmath16 .",
    "although the gpds and gdas are well - known quantities for nucleon - structure physicists especially in the nucleon - spin community , they may not be very familiar in low - energy hadron - physics communities .",
    "therefore , we provide the following introductory explanations on the wigner distributions , gpds , and gdas in secs .",
    "[ wigner ] , [ gpds ] , and [ gdas ] , respectively .",
    "our work is to connect the gpds and gdas with the exotic - hadron studies by the forms of momentum distributions of partons , form factors , _ etc .",

    "[ exotic - parton ] , [ transverse - form ] , and [ results - gda ] .",
    "nucleon structure has been investigated mainly by the form of deep - inelastic structure functions and elastic form factors .",
    "the structure functions indicate longitudinal momentum distributions of partons . in high - energy hadron reactions ,",
    "only longitudinal degrees of freedom are usually focused by integrating the transverse components .",
    "however , transverse degrees of freedom are becoming increasingly important nowadays , for example , in clarifying the origin of the nucleon spin by orbital angular momenta of partons and in describing hadron - production processes at hadron colliders such as rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) , tevatron , and lhc ( large hadron collider ) by including the transverse - momentum dependent parton distributions .",
    "therefore , the gpds , tmds , and updfs are now under extensive and systematic investigations as one of major projects in hadron physics @xcite .",
    "these quantities originate from the wigner distribution for the nucleon . in one - dimensional quantum mechanics ,",
    "the wigner distribution is defined by @xmath19 we consider the simple case of one - dimensional harmonic oscillator given by the hamiltonian @xmath20 solving the schrdinger equation , we obtain the wigner distribution @xmath21 where the functions @xmath22 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "if the classical limit is taken by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the wigner function becomes @xmath25 then , the function @xmath26 corresponds to the classical trajectory in the phase space given by the coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the delocalization of the wigner distribution indicates quantum effects due to the uncertainty principle .",
    "the wigner distribution provides information on quantum states by using the phase - space concept .    in the nucleon case ,",
    "the wigner distribution is defined for quarks by @xcite @xmath29 here , the @xmath27 is the bjorken scaling variable and it should not be confused with the space coordinate in eqs .",

    "a gauge link needs to be introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : w - gamma - nucleon ] ) for satisfying the gauge invariance .",
    "the function @xmath33 provides a complete quantum mechanical description of the internal nucleon structure by supplying the phase space distribution at the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath27 , the transverse momentum @xmath34 , and the space position @xmath35 .",
    "if this distribution is determined , it means a complete understanding on the quantum nature of the nucleon substructure from low to high energies .",
    "however , it is not realistic to determine the wigner distribution experimentally because it contains six variables .",
    "therefore , the distribution is integrated over some variables for practical measurements . depending on the integral variables , we have following physics quantities : @xmath36 as obvious from these expressions , the tmds and gpds provide three - dimensional understanding of the nucleon by effectively including the pdfs and transverse distributions .",
    "now , we introduce basic properties of the gpds and also the gdas which are the quantities obtained by the @xmath14 and @xmath15 channel crossing .          the gpds have been investigated mainly for the nucleon in order to clarify the origin of the nucleon spin and the tomography , namely the determination of a three - dimensional view of the nucleon substructure .",
    "the gpds can be measured in various reactions , virtual - compton and meson - production processes in lepton scattering @xcite and also in lepton - pair @xcite and meson production processes @xcite at hadron beam facilities .    the best process to probe the gpds is the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) shown in fig .",

    "this equation indicates that the nucleonic gpds are important for clarifying the origin of the nucleon spin because quark and gluon spin contributions seem to be rather small for explaining the nucleon spin . from these properties in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : gpd - pdf ] ) and ( [ eqn : gpd - form ] ) , the gpds contain both information on the longitudinal momentum distributions and transverse structure of the nucleon as the form factors .",
    "these facts indicate that the gpds are valuable quantities for understanding basic properties of the nucleon from low to high energies . on the other hand",
    ", it is interesting to use these quantities for exotic - hadron studies because they have information on internal structure of hadrons .",
    "the gdas are defined in the same manner with the gpds in the @xmath14-@xmath15 crossed channel as shown in fig .",

    "<S> we investigated the possibility of determining internal structure of exotic hadrons by using high - energy reaction processes , where quarks and gluons are appropriate degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it should be valuable to investigate the high - energy exclusive processes which include generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) and generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gpds and gdas contain momentum distributions of partons and form factors . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the exotic nature appears in momentum distributions of quarks as suggested by the constituent - counting rule and in the form factors associated with exotic hadron sizes and the number of constituents . </S>",
    "<S> transition gpds to exotic hadrons could probe such exotic signatures . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose that these exotic signatures should be found in exclusive production processes of exotic hadrons from @xmath0 in electron - positron annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the gdas contain information on a time - like form factor of the energy - momentum tensor of a hadron @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the cross section of @xmath2 is sensitive to the exotic signature by looking at the @xmath3 invariant - mass dependence by taking light hadrons , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . from such gda measurements , </S>",
    "<S> the tomography of exotic hadrons becomes possible , for example , by belle and babar experiments and by future linear collider . </S>"
