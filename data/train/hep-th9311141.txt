    "consider the nonrelativistic pauli hamiltonian operator for spin - polarized ( i.e. scalar ) fermions confined to the two - dimensional plane , in the presence of a uniform magnetic field ( of strength b ) perpendicular to the plane : h=12 m ( -ec ) ^2 -eb2mc [ ham ] it is well known that , in the plane , the spectrum of this hamiltonian consists of an infinite discrete set of equally spaced energy levels ( called `` landau levels '' ) , each of which is infinitely degenerate @xcite .",
    "the infinite degeneracy of each level is directly related to the infinite area of the plane , and for a sample of finite area the degeneracy @xmath4 is of the order of the net magnetic flux @xmath5 through the region ( measured in fundamental flux units @xmath6 ) : n=+ [ deg ] where @xmath7 . in the plane , the eigenstates of the energy operator ( [ ham ] ) may be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the landau level index ( corresponding to the energy eigenvalue @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the cyclotron frequency ) and @xmath12 labels the degenerate states within each landau level . in the @xmath13 landau level ,",

    "landau level , the occupation number equals the degeneracy , so the summation in ( [ den ] ) is always over @xmath4 values of @xmath12 . at some fixed point @xmath14 within the bulk of the sample ,",
    "the thermodynamic limit , @xmath0 , simply involves extending this finite sum to an infinite sum .",
    "but at the _ edge _ of the sample , each individual density @xmath15 in the sum is itself evaluated at a distance scale @xmath16 which is correlated with the particle number as @xmath17 because of ( [ deg ] ) and the condition of full filling .",
    "thus the thermodynamic limit is much more subtle at the sample boundaries .",
    "the analysis of these limits is the subject of this paper .",
    "the precise form of the eigenstates @xmath8 depends on the gauge chosen for the vector potential @xmath18 . to describe a finite sample",
    ", one should choose the gauge with the geometry of the sample boundary in mind .",
    "it is convenient to choose the gauge so that , on the boundary , the normal component of the vector potential @xmath18 vanishes . thus , for circular samples one uses the `` symmetric '' gauge , @xmath19 , while for rectangular samples ( actually for rectangular strips with upper and lower sides identified ) one uses the `` landau '' gauge , @xmath20 .",
    "owing to the degeneracy of the landau levels , a change in the gauge involves a change in the nature of the sum over @xmath12 in ( [ den ] ) , and so the functional form of @xmath21 is gauge dependent .",

    "the slope at the boundary is asymptotically constant _ 0 _ boundary = -(1+o(1n ) ) [ rderiv ]    these results for the lowest landau level density are reassuring , but not particularly surprising .",
    "the @xmath0 limit is greatly facilitated by the relation of @xmath33 to the incomplete gamma function .",
    "such a direct relation is not available for the higher landau levels due to the appearance of the laguerre polynomial factors in ( [ lden ] ) .",

    "this is a general feature of @xmath29 - there are exactly @xmath2 such steps in the vicinity of the boundary .",
    "however , if one looks more closely by magnifying the scale of @xmath21 considerably , these `` steps '' are in fact pairs of a local minimum and a local maximum .",
    "the locations of these local minima and maxima may be identified as a result of the following remarkable identity which generalizes the formula ( [ lllslope ] ) : _ n ( , n ) = - n ! e^- ^n - n-1(n-1)!l_n^n - n-1 ( )  l_n^n - n ( ) [ der ] note that , as in ( [ lllslope ] ) , taking the derivative of @xmath21 enables the removal of the summation over the angular momentum index : this is due to intricate cancellations between successive terms in the sum , using the recurrence and differential - difference relations of the laguerre polynomials . from ( [ der ] ) we see that the troughs and peaks of each step are located at the zeros of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . each laguerre factor in ( [ der ] ) is a polynomial of degree @xmath2 with @xmath2 real zeros , and , furthermore , their zeros are interwoven ( and for a given @xmath2 , the @xmath55 zero of @xmath24 increases with @xmath12 @xcite ) , explaining the pairing of local maxima and minima which gives the impression of steps .",
    "perhaps even more remarkable than this step - like behaviour is the fact that when the density functions for successive landau levels are summed , the boundary again becomes `` smooth '' ( i.e. the steps disappear ) .",
    "this is directly relevant for applications to the quantum hall effect @xcite , where one is interested , for example , in the density for full filling of the first @xmath56 landau levels : _",
