    "this is because the neutral atoms in a rotating reference frame experience a coriolis force of the same form as the lorentz force on charged particles in a magnetic field .",
    "recently , two experiments were reported , making use of a rotating ol to study quantized vortices in gaseous bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite . moreover ,  synthesis \" of a gauge field was realized by using a spatially varying raman coupling between internal atomic states to implement the required geometric phases @xcite , opening a door to more wide ranging studies associated with an artificial magnetic field that gives rise to an orbital motion of neutral atoms .",
    "the bose - hubbard model under an effective magnetic field exhibits very interesting physics @xcite , far beyond the physics of the usual bose - hubbard model .",
    "these properties are inherited from the remarkable structure of the energy spectrum for noninteracting problems , i.e. , a single particle moving on a tight - binding lattice in the presence of a uniform magnetic field . here",
    ", the energy spectrum depends sensitively on the frustration parameter @xmath1 , a magnetic flux per plaquette of the lattice , and exhibits a fractal structure known as the  hofstadter butterfly \" @xcite . for a rational value @xmath2 ( with the integers @xmath3 and @xmath4 )",
    ", there are @xmath4 bands , and each state is @xmath4-fold degenerate @xcite .",
    "a series of theoretical proposals indicates that it should be possible to implement strong gauge fields such as @xmath5 on an ol @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been experimentally demonstrated recently @xcite . in the strongly interacting regime , where both the particle number per site and the magnetic flux per plaquette are of order unity , it is theoretically predicted that there exist strongly correlated phases representative of the continuum quantum hall states @xcite . in the weakly - interacting condensed phase under the strong magnetic field , the frustrated josephson junction arrays provide a close analog of that system , and implementations using cold atoms have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these studies focused mainly on the ground - state properties and the quantum phase transitions at _ zero temperature_. however , they are mostly based on the exact diagonalization study and are restricted to small systems . in this paper , we study the _ finite - temperature _ phase diagram of hard - core bosons in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ol with an effective gauge field .",

    "for the fully frustrated xy model ( ffxym ) with @xmath9 , there would be double phase transitions , one is associated with the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition due to the global u(1 ) symmetry and the other associated with ising - model - like transition due to the z@xmath10 chiral symmetry of the ground state . a central issue in the studies of the ffxym has been to clarify how these two distinct types of orderings take place @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that , even at the temperature where the z@xmath10 chirality establishes a long - range order at @xmath11 , the u(1 ) phase ( xy - spin ) may remain disordered due to thermally excited , unbound vortices .",
