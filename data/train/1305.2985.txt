    "in multicarrier systems like ofdm , subcarriers allocated to a user may face interference due to a variety of reasons .",
    "these include the activity of other users and allocation decisions of neighbouring base stations in a cellular network .",
    "predicting the presence or absence of interference in a particular subcarrier may not be feasible at a transmitter in such uncoordinated networks .",
    "nevertheless , it is practical to assume that a subcarrier allocated to a user does not face interference in every channel instantiation .",
    "thus , there is a scope for harnessing such _ bursty _",
    "interference in multicarrier systems and exploring the possibility of opportunistic rate increments .",
    "the following toy example , based on parallel linear deterministic channels , captures the intuition behind our problem formulation .",
    "consider @xmath0 transmitters ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and @xmath0 receivers ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "for @xmath6 , @xmath7 has messages for @xmath8 and at discrete time index @xmath9 , @xmath7 can transmit @xmath0 bits @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath0 bits correspond to @xmath0 subcarriers ( parallel channels ) allocated to each transmitter - receiver pair .",
    "depending on the interference channel realization ( stays constant for @xmath9 ) , @xmath8 receives one of the three possibilities : @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] ( shown in figure  [ fig : toy_example_wireless ] ) , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the first possibility corresponds to the interference free case ( for @xmath8 ) and the remaining two possibilities correspond to interference from @xmath16 ( only one of the subcarriers of @xmath8 gets interfered ) .",
    "hence , there are @xmath17 distinct possibilities for the pair of received values at @xmath4 and @xmath5 over time duration @xmath18 .     in the toy example .",
    "the `` @xmath19 '' operator denotes modulo @xmath0 addition and indicates the presence of interference . as shown above , interference is not present in all channel realizations for @xmath8 ( hence bursty ) ; but whenever it is present , it is limited to just @xmath20 out of the @xmath0 transmitted bits . ]    the crucial constraint in this setup is that the transmitters do not know _ a priori _ the interference channel realization . the channel is used @xmath18 times ( time index @xmath9 ) and we have the following ( symmetric ) rate requirement : ensure base rate @xmath21 at a receiver when _ any _ one of the subcarriers ( of the receiver ) gets interfered and ensure rate @xmath22 at a receiver when both subcarriers ( of the receiver ) are interference free ( _ i.e. , _ opportunistically deliver incremental rate @xmath23 , in addition to @xmath21 , whenever a receiver is interference free ) . in this setup , we are interested in characterizing the rate region @xmath24 as the performance metric .",
    "clearly , @xmath25 ( a maximum of @xmath0 bits per time index can be sent by a transmitter ) and corner point @xmath26 is easily achievable .",
    "also , the corner point @xmath27 can be easily achieved by using a repetition code across the @xmath0 subcarriers ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the repetition code ensures decodability of the message ( of rate @xmath21 ) irrespective of which subcarrier gets interfered . using time sharing between corner points @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", we can achieve @xmath32 .",
    "intuitively this looks like the best we can do , and indeed it can be shown to be tight using entropy inequalities .",
    "the problem pursued in this paper is a generalization of this example through parallel linear deterministic interference channels ( leading to a rate region with more than two non - trivial corner points in most cases ) .    in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the problem of harnessing bursty interference was studied for a single carrier scenario using a degraded message set approach .",
    "this approach guarantees a base rate when the carrier faces interference .",
    "in addition to the base rate , an incremental rate is provided whenever the carrier is interference free . in the multicarrier version considered in this paper , every user ( receiver )",
    "is allocated @xmath1 subcarriers ( parallel channels ) and we extend the degraded message set approach for a rate tuple @xmath33 as follows : ( a ) when all @xmath1 subcarriers of a user get interfered , the user achieves rate @xmath34 ( b ) when any @xmath35 out of @xmath1 subcarriers get interfered , the user achieves rate @xmath36 and ( c ) when all @xmath1 subcarriers are interference free , the user achieves rate @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the user experiences opportunistic rate increments as the number of interfered subcarriers decreases . maintaining low message complexity",
    "is the practical idea behind considering the number of interfered subcarriers rather than the specific set of subcarriers interfered .",
    "the problem formulation has some similarity with symmetric multilevel diversity coding @xcite and our results demonstrate that similar tools ( subset entropy inequalities ) as in @xcite can be used in this context .",
    "our main contributions in this paper are :    * inner bounds for @xmath38 and @xmath39 setups using erasure coding across subcarriers ( employed for specific interfered _ levels _ in a subcarrier ) , signal - scale alignment @xcite and han - kobayashi scheme .",
    "* develop outer bounds using techniques inspired by multilevel diversity codes .",
    "* the inner and outer bounds coincide for several regimes .",
