    "this distance is essentially characterized by the distance between the means of the laws in regards to the deviations .",
    "but we also take into account the direction of the deviation . for example , let be given two uncertainty ellipses with high eccentricity and orthogonal orientations .",
    "if these ellipses intersect at their extremities ( the union forms a corner or a @xmath0 instead of a cross ) , we will consider that the laws tend to be distant .",

    "in this section , we are interested in the fusion of two independent estimators by means of the bayesian inference .",
    "such fusion has to take into account the prior about the state of the system .",
    "subsequently , this prior will be chosen to be uniform .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath60 . as a consequence , @xmath61 and",
    "then : @xmath62 so , in order to compute @xmath51 , it is needed both @xmath54 , @xmath63 and the prior @xmath64 .",
    "if one assumes uniform prior for @xmath64 , and using notations @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the bayes fusion formula   becomes : @xmath68      we investigate here the solution of the problem when @xmath31 and @xmath32 are gaussian distributions .",
    "so let s suppose for simplicity @xmath69 and @xmath70 mono - dimensional gaussian distributions given by : @xmath71 in absence of prior information , one assumes as usual @xmath64 uniform .",
    "the bayesian rule requires to compute  ( [ f2k7:sectcomp : eq:1 ] ) .",
    "then , it is easily shown that @xmath72 is gaussian : @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 when @xmath76 , it is implied then : @xmath77 the theoretical plots and those obtained with monte carlo simulation are given in figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and  [ fig2part ] .",
    "these figures make the comparison with the p - pcr5 fused densities . this comparison will be discussed subsequently .",
    "while the bayesian estimator is optimal ( it minimizes the variance of the error estimation ) , it appears also that it replaces the original modes in @xmath31 and @xmath32 by a unique mode in @xmath72 .",
    "when the original modes are distant@xmath78 like in figure  [ fig2 ] ( for example , owing to a bad initialization of the filters ) , it may be interesting to keep the original modes in the fused density until it is possible to decide .",
    "this is what p - pcr5 does .      the same gaussian distribution , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",
    "are considered , but are now fused by p - pcr5 rule , thus resulting in density @xmath34 .",
    "the fused densities are both computed , figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] , and sampled , figure  [ fig2part ] .",
    "direct computations are expensive , and are obtained in two steps :    * compute , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 , * then compute @xmath81 .",
    "it appears clearly that computed and sampled densities match well , thus confirming the rigthness of our sampling method .",
    "now , contrariwise to the bayesian rule , it is noticed two different behaviors ( which are foreseeable mathematically ) :    * when the densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are close@xmath78 , @xmath34 act as an amplifier of the information by reducing the variance .",
    "however , this phenomena is weaker than for @xmath82 .",
    "p - pcr5 is thus able to amplify the fused information , but is less powerful than the bayesian rule in this task .",
    "* when the densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are distant@xmath78 , @xmath34 keeps both modes present in each density and preserves the richness of information by not merging both densities into only one ( unimodal ) gaussian density .",
    "this is a very interesting and new property from a theoretical point of view , which presents advantages for practical applications as shown in the following simple tracking example .    in regards to these differences",
    ", it is thus foreseeable that the p - pcr5 should be more robust to potential errors .",
    "it has been seen that the p - pcr5 fusion of the same densities @xmath83 will result in an amplified density @xmath34 .",
    "of course , this is not practicable when the densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are related to correlated variables .",
    "consider for example that the state @xmath41 are measured by @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the ( distributed ) posterior probabilities are @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "it happens that the variables estimated by @xmath31 and @xmath32 are correlated , so that p - pcr5 should not be applied directly .",
    "in particular , the fusion of @xmath31 and @xmath32 by means of p - pcr5 results in a density @xmath34 stronger than the prior @xmath88 over @xmath41 , even when there is no informative measure , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath89 ! in order to handle this difficulty , we propose a _ whitened _ p - pcr5 rule , producing a fused density @xmath90 from the updated information only : @xmath91+\\frac{p(y_2|z^2)}{p(y_2)}\\delta[y_2=y]}{\\frac{p(y_1|z^1)}{p(y_1)}+\\frac{p(y_2|z^2)}{p(y_2)}}\\;. \\end{array}\\ ] ] in  , the proportion @xmath92 should be considered as the information intrinsically obtained from sensor @xmath93 .",
    "it happens that the whitened p - pcr5 does not change the prior when there is no informative measure , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath94 when @xmath89 for @xmath87 .",
    "a target is moving according to a known markov prior law .",
    "let @xmath95 be the state of the target at time @xmath96 .",
    "it is assumed : @xmath97 in order to estimate the state of the target , @xmath98 sensors are providing some measurements .",

    "there is a bayesian approach to this problem , and we propose some comparison with a p - pcr5 approach and a whitened p - pcr5 approach .",

    "more precisely , the outputs @xmath108 of the local filters are in fact related to the same prior estimation at time @xmath109 .",

    "+ these filters have been implemented by means of particles .",
    "the sampling of p - pcr5 has been explained yet , but it is not the purpose of this paper to explain all the theory of particle filtering ; a consultation of the literature , _",
    "@xcite , is expected .        in order to test the p - pcr5 fusion rule",
    ", we simulate the following scenario : in a 2-dimensional space , two independent passive sensors are located in ( 0,100 ) and ( 100,0 ) in cartesian coordinates .",
    "these sensors provide a noisy azimuth measurement ( _ 0.01 rad . _",
    "normal noise ) on the position of a moving target .",
    "we associate a tracking particle filter to each sensor .",
    "the motion model is the following : @xmath111 + in our simulations , each local particle filter is implemented by means of 200 particles . at every time step , we proceed to the fusion of the local posterior densities and then re - inject the fused state density into each local filter ( feedback loop ) .",
    "three different paradigms are considered for the fusion : bayesian , p - pcr5 and whitened p - pcr5 rules .",
    "these filters try to estimate both the mobile position and speed of the target which is assumed to follow a quasi - constant velocity model .",
    "it is noticed that we are dealing directly with both the observable and non - observable components of the target state ( each sensor is concerned ) . in particular , notice that this infers an additional perturbation to the basic particle bayesian filter , even if there is a feedback .              in this first example , the filters are well initialized ( we give them good starting speed and position ) .",
    "the mobile follows a non - linear trajectory ( figure  [ traj_courbe ] ) , in order to show the capability of this distributed filter to converge . on this example , the bayesian filter manages to track the target with some difficulties during the last curve in figure  [ traj_courbe ] . on the same example",
    ", p - pcr5 and whitened p - pcr5 rules have been tested with success .",
    "while both filters have to reestimate the speed direction at each turn , it appears that this reestimation is more difficult for p - pcr5 .",
    "this difference is also particularly apparent during the last curve .",
    "figure  [ tournant ] displays the particle cloud of the whitened pcr-5 filter during and after the last curve .",
    "the variance rises during the curve , resulting in the cross - like cloud of sub - figure  [ tourne ] , which is characteristic to the p - pcr5 fusion : _ the branches correspond to the direction the sensors are looking at . _",
    "then , the p - pcr5 , by amplifying the zone where the filters are according to see the object , allows the process to converge again toward the object real position in an expansion - contraction pattern ( figure  [ tourne2 ] ) . in more difficult cases , with poor initialization for instance ( see figure  [ traj_courbe_poor ] ) , both p - pcr5 and whitened p - pcr5 manage to follow the target , while the bayesian filter diverges in about @xmath112 percent of the cases .",
    "next sections investigate more thoroughly the properties of the whitened p - pcr5 filtering .      in order to test the capability of ( whitened ) p - pcr5 to recover from erroneous measurements of the local estimations , we considered two scenarios in which the filters are differently and badly initialized . in these scenarios ,",
    "the real trajectory of the object is the same : it starts at @xmath113 and moves toward @xmath114 at a constant speed @xmath115 .",
    ".initialization data [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the first scenario ( figure  [ bad_init ] ) , the first filter , which sensor is placed at @xmath116 , is initialized at position @xmath117 and at speed @xmath118 .",
    "the second filter , which sensor is at @xmath119 , is initialized at position @xmath120 and at the same speed ( figure  [ bad_init1 ] ) .",
    "as the estimated positions are far from the real one ( in regards to the noise models ) and both sensors are looking at the object from a remote position , the particle cloud quickly spread horizontally ( figure  [ bad_init10 ] ) .",
    "then the ( whitened ) pcr5 begins to find zones where both filters estimate a non - negligible probability of presence and amplifies them until convergence ( figure  [ bad_init20 ] ) .",
    "though the particle cloud still seems to be fairly spread ( because of sensors remote position ) , the global estimate is very close from the real position and speed , and will remain so until the last time step ( figure  [ bad_init60 ] ) .",
    "our second example ( figure  [ worse_init ] ) is a limit case : the initialization is quite worse ( see table  [ init_data ] ) , since our motion model assumes nearly constant speed and therefore makes it hard to recover from such erroneous and contradictory speed initialization .",
    "an interesting point is that , for a tight prediction noise , p - pcr5 sometimes does not converge on this example , while whitened p - pcr5 usually does . artificially raising the prediction noise",
    "solves this problem for ` standard ' p - pcr5 , showing its trend to over - concentrate the particle cloud .      as seen before , the pcr5-fusion of two probabilistic densities amplifies the areas where both densities have a non - negligible value .",
    "otherwise , it usually works like just averaging the two densities . in order to measure the impact of the amplification , we reprocessed the first example of previous subsection while using the mean , @xmath121 , instead of p - pcr5 .",
    "the result ( figure  [ mean ] ) is self explanatory : the same expansion as with pcr5 occurs ( figure  [ bad_init ] ) , but contraction never appears .",
    "the results presented here have clearly shown that p - pcr5 , and especially whitened p - pcr5 , filters are more robust than the basic bayesian filter .",
    "however , it is clear that bayesian filters are the best , when the priors are correctly defined and the variables are locally observable ( notice that there are adaptations of the basic bayesian filter to non - observable variables  @xcite ) .",
    "the real interest of p - pcr5 is that it does not need prior knowledges about the antedating local particle filters : just apply the method and obtain consistent results !",
    "this paper has investigated a new fusion rule , p - pcr5 , for fusing probabilistic densities .",
    "this rule is derived from the pcr5 rule for fusing evidences .",
    "it has a simple interpretation from a sampling point of view .",
    "p - prc5 has been compared to the bayesian rule on a simple fusion example .",
