    "to put it differently , the pure real scalar correction to the renormalization of the higgs sector is consistent .",

    "hence part of the correction in the two - point function is removed by the contribution of the third term in ( [ equ : ghdct ] ) .",
    "these three terms correspond to the following contributions to the four - point , three - point , and two - point functions and should be added to them , respectively : @xmath79 a key point is that after the spontaneous breaking of global u(1 ) symmetry the squared - momentum - dependent terms in the @xmath20 corrections to the three - point and four - point functions are simultaneously removed by the higher - derivative counterterms derived from ( [ equ : originalhdct ] ) for four - point and three - point functions , respectively .    taking into account ( [ equ : hdctcontributions ] ) , from two - point and three - point functions and eq.([equ : gonepoint ] ) , it is straightforward to get @xmath80 while from two - point and four - point functions and eq.([equ : gonepoint ] ) , one can obtain @xmath81    it is easy to find that the results for @xmath82 and @xmath83 obtained from two - point and three - point functions of the higgs field [ see eqs.([equ : gc3point ] ) ] and that from two - point and four - point functions [ see eq.([equ : gc4point ] ) ] contradict each other , which indicates that the lowest order gravitational correction to the renormalizations of the higgs sector in this model is inconsistent .",

    "there is no goldstone field after the spontaneous breaking of the discrete z@xmath71 symmetry .",
    "therefore , compared with the case of the @xmath74 theory with spontaneously broken global u(1 ) symmetry , all of the feynman diagrams with goldstone field @xmath54 in the pure real scalar correction part should be removed here .",
    "it is easy to check that the renormalization of the higgs field @xmath53 self - correction is also consistent , and the result reads @xmath86    for gravitational correction to @xmath37 theory with spontaneously broken z@xmath71 symmetry , the interactions between higgs field @xmath53 and graviton @xmath18 , hence the related feynman diagrams , and the high derivative counterterms , do not change compared with the case of @xmath37 theory with spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry . on the other hand , as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ corrections ] , the goldstone field does not contribute to the gravitational correction to the higgs sector in the case of @xmath37 theory with spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "therefore even though the goldstone field is absent in the case of @xmath37 theory with spontaneously broken z@xmath71 symmetry , there is no difference between these two cases for @xmath20 gravitational correction to the higgs sector .",
    "the contradiction of the gravitational correction to higgs field still holds .",
    "in order to reveal the reason of the inconsistence of the gravitational correction to the higgs sector , we make some comparison with sqed with spontaneously broken global u(1 ) symmetry , whose lagrangian takes the form @xmath87 where the potential @xmath88 is given by eq.([equ : potential ] ) , and the kinetic term is @xmath89 with @xmath90 . the renormalizability of this model with local u(1 ) transformation had been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the behavior of this model under the global u(1 ) transformation eq.([equ : transformation ] ) .",
    "using eqs.([equ : vev ] ) , ( [ equ : decomposion ] ) , ( [ equ : vacuum ] ) and ( [ equ : barefield ] ) , and setting @xmath91 in eq.([equ : barefield ] ) , one arrives at @xmath92    in this case , the covariant derivative in the kinetic term @xmath93 consists the gauge field @xmath94 since the complex scalar field @xmath44 carries charge .",
    "this directly leads to the appearance the mixing between @xmath94 and @xmath54 ( see the last term in eq.([equ : sqedtterm ] ) ) after the spontaneous breaking of global u(1 ) symmetry , which is proved to play a crucial role in the renormalization of this model .",
    "because of such mixing term , the gauge field will be massive after eating the goldstone boson and the mass of the gauge field , which is related to the vev , is just the reflection of the information from the spontaneous breaking of global u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "the reason that the massive gauge field can give a consistent correction to the higgs field @xmath53 is that the massive gauge field contains not only the original massless gauge field but also the goldstone field which is a part of the original complex scalar field @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , considering the coupling constants and interactions of three - point and four - point higgs field self - interactions are not independent after the spontaneous breaking of global u(1 ) symmetry , one can not expect that an ordinary alien gauge field could give a consistent correction to such model .",
    "but only if the parameters in the theory , e.g. , mass of gauge boson @xmath95 , is connected with the vev of the original complex scalar field by the mixing term between @xmath94 and @xmath54 , and the interactions among the gauge field , the higgs field , and the goldstone field are derived from the spontaneous breaking of global u(1 ) symmetry , the expectation for a consistent correction is reasonable .",
    "but something changes in the case of the gravitational correction to the higgs sector in our model .",
    "when the complex scalar field @xmath44 couples to gravity , the connection in the covariant derivative of the kinetic term of the field , e.g. , @xmath96 , vanishes , resulting in @xmath97 .",
    "this will directly lead to the absence of the two - point mixing terms between the graviton and the goldstone field . on the other hand ,",
    "considering the symmetry is spontaneously broken in the internal charged field space , which is different from the external spacetime , one will find this is natural that the goldstone field can mix with gauge field @xmath94 but not graviton @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the information of the spontaneous breaking of symmetry puts no influence on the graviton , and the goldstone field , which appears after the spontaneous breaking of symmetry , no longer contributes to the gravitational correction to the higgs sector .",
    "actually this inconsistent result is not surprising when we take into account what we considered is the correction of an alien field , which carries no information of the original symmetry , to the higgs field after the spontaneous breaking of symmetry .",
    "it is also interesting to compare a graviton in this model with a gluon in the quantum chromodynamics . since the higgs field is a color singlet , the coupling between the gluon field and the goldstone field is forbidden .",
    "therefore the two - point mixing term between the gluon and the goldstone field is also absent .",
    "but unlike the fact that the correction of the gluon to the higgs sector is meaningless , gravity can couple to higgs field and contribute to the correction of the higgs field due to the fact that gravity is a reflection of the feature of spacetime and could couple to any kind of energy .",
    "hence in the sm , every field that contributes to the correction to the higgs sector will be influenced by the spontaneous breaking of symmetry , specifically speaking , the masses of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are related to the vev of the original complex scalar field , while on the other hand , the gluon and photon , whose couplings with the higgs field are absent , will not contribute to such a correction .",
    "for this reason , the consistence of the gravitational correction to the sm is questionable considering that the gravity , even not influenced by the spontaneous breaking of symmetry , will still contribute to the correction to the higgs sector in the sm .",
    "in summary , in this paper we considered a model in which perturbatively quantized einstein gravity couples to the @xmath74 theory with spontaneously broken global u(1 ) symmetry and calculated the lowest order pure real scalar correction and gravitational correction to the renormalizations of the higgs sector .",
    "it is found that there is a contradiction in the gravitational correction to the renormalization of the higgs sector while the pure real scalar correction to it leads to a compatible renormalization of such model .",
    "based on the analysis above , the consistence for the gravitational correction to the renormalization of the higgs sector in the sm , where the electroweak su(2)@xmath7u(1)@xmath8 symmetry is spontaneously broken , is open to doubt .",
    "it is expected that this contradiction will still hold there , which is the subject of future study .",
