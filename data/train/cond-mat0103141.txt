    "soon after the discovery of carbon nanotubes,@xcite it was recognized that these compounds can have electronic properties ranging from semiconducting to metallic , depending on the details of their atomic structure ( see chapter 19 in ref . ) . this has led to much speculation about nanotubular systems becoming the materials of choice for future miniaturizations of electronic devices towards the nanodomain.@xcite some major challenges are the control of the growth mechanism in order to obtain carbon nanotubes with specific electronic properties , and the development of techniques to wire together semiconducting and metallic nanotubes in a controlled manner .",
    "one approach for connecting carbon nanotube devices could be the use of other metallic nanotubes that function as wires on the same length scale .    in an earlier publication,@xcite we discussed the possible existence of metallic boron nanotubes that could serve such a purpose .",
    "boron nanotubes can be constructed from the so - called _ aufbau principle _ for the formation of stable boron compounds formulated in ref . .",
    "aufbau principle _ identifies a small set of simple structural features characteristic of the most stable isomers of pure boron clusters and proposes that highly stable boron clusters , surfaces , and networks can be constructed using only these structural elements .",
    "crystalline @xmath1-boron has long been the paradigm for boron bonding .",
    "it is comprised of b@xmath2 icosahedra with six - fold inverse - umbrella coordination,@xcite a configuration that obeys the _ aufbau principle_. the coordination in the proposed boron nanotubes is very different  hexagonal pyramidal  but also follows the _",
    "aufbau principle_. in a recent study of clusters of 96 boron atoms,@xcite we showed that the formation of large quasi  planar and tubular systems with six - fold pyramidal bonding is favored over the formation of cluster aggregates typical for crystalline @xmath1boron .",
    "we also found that the strain energy of boron nanotubes relative to the corresponding sheets is intermediate between those of the carbon and boron ",
    "nitride systems,@xcite another favorable condition for the formation of boron nanotubes .    in this paper , the large family of layered metal diborides is used as a starting point for investigating metal - boron nanotubes .",
    "diborides of the alb@xmath0 lattice type have graphene - like layers of boron atoms , with metal atoms located halfway between the boron layers .",
    "these structures are similar to the pure boron surfaces discussed in ref . .",
    "in fact , in ref . , the alb@xmath0 system was used to help elucidate the quasi - planar configurations found for pure boron . here",
    "we extend the analogy to the tubular systems .",
    "density functional calculations are used to explore the geometry , stability , and electronic structure of some prototype al - b nanotube materials .",
    "the prototype nanotubular systems presented here are found to be energetically competitive with the corresponding bulk counterparts , suggesting that synthesis of such nanotubes might be possible .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : alb2 ] is devoted to the structural properties of the diboride systems .",
    "we analyze the alb@xmath0 lattice type , describe some of the basic physical properties of diborides , and illustrate the geometric construction of metal  boron nanotubes starting from metal  diboride systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , the technical details of the _ ab initio _ calculations are given . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present some prototypical al - b nanotubular structures that are calculated to be energetically favorable , and we discuss the bonding and electronic structure of these systems . conclusions and remarks about future work are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the present study proposes a new class of nanotubular materials and opens the door to a range of interesting problems for future studies .",
    "the typical diboride structure is the alb@xmath0 lattice , which is composed of two parallel systems of flat layers.@xcite one layer contains boron atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice like a graphene sheet ( see fig.[figure1](a ) ) .",
    "the al atoms form a triangular lattice that is located halfway between the graphene - like sheets , positioned so that the al atoms project down onto the centers of the boron hexagons ( see fig.[figure1](b ) ) .",
    "the space group is @xmath3 , and the primitive cell is hexagonal with one formula unit per cell .",
    "typically , the in - plane lattice constant is around @xmath4 .@xcite this corresponds to an in - plane b - b distance of about 1.8  , which is similar to the b - b bondlength in @xmath1-boron .",
    "the interplanar b - b distance is significantly larger , with typical @xmath5 ratios of about 1.1.@xcite the family of diborides of the alb@xmath0 type comprises materials with a wide variety of metal atoms substituting for the al position .",
    "there are at least 22 members of the family,@xcite ranging from mnb@xmath0 with an effective metallic radius of 1.29  to gdb@xmath0 with an effective metallic radius of 1.81  .",
    "simple @xmath6 elements , as well as @xmath7- and @xmath8-electron atoms can be accommodated .",
    "the ability of the alb@xmath0 lattice to incorporate metals that differ so much in size and electronic structure is remarkable , and it raises the possibility of forming alloys between members of this family .    the construction of nanotubular structures from the alb@xmath0 lattice type is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . ignoring the amplitudes of the al atoms for the moment ( fig.[figure1](b ) ) , we see that alb@xmath0 nanotubes can be generated by the same cut - and - paste procedure used to generate carbon nanotubes from graphene sheets.@xcite nanotubes may be classified by a pair of integers @xmath9 , that specify a cut along a vector @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are primitive lattice vectors for the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this first cut is followed by a second cut perpendicular to this direction that continues until another atom of the honeycomb lattice is hit .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows the resulting sheet for a ( 6,6 ) type of nanotube in both systems . rolling up a general sheet and pasting it along the perpendicular direction from both ends of the @xmath9 cut vector generates the basic unit cell of an @xmath9 nanotube . for the purpose of _ ab initio _",
    "simulations , it is common practice to place these tubes side by side on a hexagonal superlattice,@xcite thereby approximating the bundles in which these compounds form in nature .",
    "it is interesting to note that if b is substituted for al in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) , the structure becomes a puckered layer of six - fold coordinated boron .",
    "if the construction described above is applied , we obtain the pure boron nanotubes described in ref . , where we also introduced a different but equivalent construction procedure labelled by a pair of integers that describes cuts along the unit vectors of a triangular lattice .",
    "we conjectured that the best way to put boron nanotubes on a hexagonal superlattice would be to arrange them such that pairs of boron atoms meet along the directions of the underlying hexagonal lattice.@xcite such an arrangement leads to a type of chemical bonding between the tubes that is analogous to what is found for planar forms of pure boron . in the planar systems ,",
    "pairwise bonds between 7-fold coordinated boron sticking out of puckered 6-fold coordinated layers of boron were found to be the most favorable arrangement for binding single sheets together to form layered systems.@xcite    in earlier studies,@xcite we found that tubular boron systems could stand alone , _",
    "i.e. _ , like carbon nanotubes , they like to bundle in the form of a hexagonal superlattice , but they do not have to .",
    "for the diboride system , the situation may be different .",
    "studies of small boron clusters indicate that neither the honeycomb lattice nor the related carbon  type nanotube structure is stable for boron.@xcite in fact , the local atomic structure of the diboride systems suggests that metal atoms are necessary to stabilize honeycomb boron layers or the tubes derived from such layers .",
    "the metal atoms themselves have to bind to a sufficient number of boron atoms ( 12 in the case of the alb@xmath0 lattice ) .",
    "it is not clear _ a priori _ whether one could simply bind metal atoms inside or outside of a carbon  type boron tube to stabilize a single tube , or whether those tubes are more likely to come in larger bundles of carbon  type boron nanotubes with metal atoms both inside and between the tubes , serving in part to bind the tubes together . for al - b tubes , our _ ab initio _ calculations",
    "show that the latter arrangement is preferred , as discussed in sec.[sec : results ] .",
    "calculations were carried out using the vasp package,@xcite a density functional@xcite based _ ab initio _ total - energy code using plane - wave basis sets and ultrasoft pseudopotentials.@xcite when performing structural optimizations , we let _ all _ degrees of freedom relax , _",
    "i.e. , _ the complete set of atomic positions as well as the parameters of the unit cell . the optimal configurations as well as the electronic structure for each relaxation step were determined using preconditioned conjugate gradient procedures.@xcite    the kinetic - energy cutoffs used for the plane - wave expansion of electronic wavefunctions were 358.2 ev for c ( which we use as a reference system ) , 161.5 ev for al , and 321.4 ev for b and all of the al - b systems .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled on grids of ( 13x13x13 ) k - points in the cases of crystalline alb@xmath0 and fcc al , ( 8x8x8 ) k - points in the case of graphite , and ( 5x5x5 ) k - points in the case of all tubular systems with the exception of the ( 6,6 ) carbon nanotube for which ( 4x4x4 ) k - points were used .",
    "these meshes yield mev accuracy in the binding energies , and their differing sizes reflect differences in unit - cell sizes .",
    "care was taken to include a sufficient number of bands above the fermi level to avoid numerical problems in the iterative diagonalization scheme .",
    "although the calculations were well converged with respect to the number of plane waves and k - points , the results presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] have to be interpreted with care .",
    "in particular , the ultrasoft pseudopotential for boron seems to overbind @xmath1-boron by about 0.7 ev / atom as compared to results for the same system obtained with harder norm - conserving pseudopotentials.@xcite on the other hand , the cohesive energy we calculate for the diboride alb@xmath0 is in excellent agreement with recent all  electron lda calculations on diboride systems.@xcite this suggests that the ultrasoft pseudopotential for boron has difficulty describing the inverse - umbrella bonding in @xmath1-boron , but it nevertheless gives an accurate description for nearly planar configurations of boron like the ones found in the diborides , quasi - planar boron sheets , and their related nanotubes .",
    "another potential problem is the fact that the conjugate gradient optimization does not guarantee the detection of a global minimum .",
    "given the reported pathology of the energy hypersurfaces of boron clusters,@xcite it is likely that for the large systems discussed below , we relax into local minima rather than global minima .",
    "however , as discussed in ref . , it is also likely that the relaxed structures capture the right chemistry , and all we have to worry about is the fact that the cohesive energies corresponding to these local minima will be slightly higher than those of the global minimum .",
    "unlike pure boron and pure carbon nanotubes , the al - b nanotubes we investigated do not appear to be stable as stand - alone tubes .",
    "we were unable to converge structural optimizations of isolated tubes constructed by rolling up puckered sheets of alb@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , in structural optimizations of al - b nanotubes on periodic superlattices , the tubes always ended up packed closely together , even if they started out well separated .",
    "hence , for the remainder of this paper , we focus on results for al - b tubes arranged on a hexagonal superlattice . for comparison , parallel calculations were performed for pure boron and pure carbon nanotubes . in each case , the ( 6,6 ) nanotube was used as a prototype .",
    "the first step was to generate reference data for atomic structure and cohesive energies .",
    "this data is listed in the lower part of table  [ table1 ] .",
    "fcc al and @xmath1-boron serve as basic reference structures for the al - b systems .",
    "phase - separated alb@xmath0 ( into fcc al and @xmath1-boron ) is calculated to have a cohesive energy of 6.38 ev / atom . as can be seen in table  [ table1 ] ,",
    "crystalline alb@xmath0 is calculated to be only slightly stable against phase separation .",
    "however , the validity of this result is questionable in light of the known stability of crystalline alb@xmath0.@xcite as we did a full relaxation on all systems , with high plane - wave cutoffs and many k - points , we attribute the problem to the overbinding of @xmath1-boron discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] . as already mentioned ,",
    "the cohesive energy of alb@xmath0 obtained in a recent all - electron calculation@xcite is in excellent agreement with our value listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the same considerations apply when we examine the stability of the ( 6,6 ) boron nanotube .",
    "the results in table  [ table1 ] indicate that the ( 6,6 ) boron nanotube is unstable by 0.5 ev / atom compared to crystalline @xmath1-boron .",
    "this is in contrast to our recent all  electron _ ab initio _ calculations , which found that for b@xmath13 clusters , the nanotubular isomers challenge or exceed the stability of cluster aggregates found in @xmath1-boron.@xcite again , we attribute this discrepancy to the overbinding of @xmath1-boron by the ultrasoft pseudopotential used .",
    "the situation looks more promising when we analyze the _ chemistry _ of the boron nanotubes . the relaxed structure for the ( 6,6 ) boron nanotube",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) .",
    "note that the representation of the tubes in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] is perhaps unusual in that no tube is shown in its entirety . instead",
    ", this representation is used to emphasize the chemical bonding between nanotubes sitting on the hexagonal superlattice . prominent boron",
    "to boron bonding along the direction of the lattice is evident in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) .",
    "further , there is a slight faceting due to undulations from the basic hexagonal lattice of the quasiplanar reference structure .",
    "both of these features are in perfect agreement with the structure and the chemical bonding found in boron sheets.@xcite therefore , it is reasonable to take the relaxed ( 6,6 ) boron nanotube as a good starting structure when looking for nanotubes of the al - b type .",
    "table  [ table1 ] includes an additional set of benchmarks . by comparing graphite and the ( 6,6 ) carbon nanotube ( fig .",
    "[ figure2](a ) ) , we get a realistic measure for the energetic difference between comparable carbon nanotubes and their layered reference structure .",
    "we calculate the ( 6,6 ) carbon nanotube to be about 0.14 ev / atom higher in energy than graphite .",
    "tubes with larger radii would have even smaller instabilities.@xcite    among the many variants of al - b nanotubes that we explored , we focus on the two shown in figs .",
    "[ figure2](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "our approach was to start with the relaxed b nanotube and substitute al for b. the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2](c ) has composition al@xmath14b@xmath15 and was generated from the ( 6,6 ) nanotube by removing pairs of boron atoms located along the directions of the hexagonal lattice , and substituting them by single al atoms .",
    "this can happen at three different places within the unit cell , and the al atom then sees a local atomic environment similar to alb@xmath0 .",
    "indeed , after full relaxation , the system tends to recreate these local environments , and the tube as a whole becomes less puckered ( compare fig .",
    "[ figure2](c ) to the puckered b tube in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) and the unpuckered c tube in fig .",
    "[ figure2](a ) ) .",
    "however , the energetic gain is not substantial : the cohesive energy of phase - separated al@xmath14b@xmath15 is about 7.2 ev / atom , so there is only a small improvement in stability as compared to the ( 6,6 ) boron tube .",
    "figure  [ figure2](d ) shows an al - b nanotube system with stoichiometry alb@xmath0 .",
    "this configuration is calculated to be unstable by only 0.23 ev / atom compared to crystalline alb@xmath0 .",
    "while this energy difference is not quite as small as that between the ( 6,6 ) carbon tube and graphite , it is close .",
    "the structure was generated from the ( 6,6 ) boron nanotube by substituting al for boron at the six positions located along the directions of the hexagonal superlattice , which are on the outside layer of the puckered tube , and at six positions on the inside layer of the tube . in the optimized structure ,",
    "the tubes are rotated from the orientations they adopt in the superlattice of pure boron nanotubes in such a way that al atoms sticking out from adjacent tubes do not face each other , but rather sit between boron layers .",
    "such an arrangement locks the tubes together in a gear - like fashion , and creates a local environment similar to that in crystalline alb@xmath0 .",
    "the inclusion of al atoms inside the tube is found to be important for stabilizing this structure .",
    "the electronic densities of states ( dos ) calculated for crystalline alb@xmath0 as well as the ( 6,6 ) b , al@xmath14b@xmath15 , and alb@xmath0 tubes are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "all of the tubes are metallic .",
    "this result was predicted in ref .",
    "based on qualitative arguments related to hexagonal tight - binding models,@xcite as well as on static _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the present results show that these predictions even hold after a complete structural relaxation .",
    "the overall shape of the dos for crystalline and tubular alb@xmath0 are similar due to similarities in local atomic environments .",
    "the dos of the alb@xmath0 nanotube , however , has much more fine structure , which can be understood in terms of a backfolding of the bands of crystalline alb@xmath0 into the reduced brillouin zone of the tubular lattice .",
    "the dos of al@xmath14b@xmath15 plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure3](c ) on the other hand shows some similarity to the dos of the ( 6,6 ) boron nanotube depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) , with some distortion due to the modest content of al atoms .",
    "we have explored the plausibility of metal - boron nanotubular systems derived from diboride materials .",
    "our data suggests that it may be possible to synthesize such systems .",
    "we predict that metal  boron nanotubular materials will likely form in bundles built from rolled up graphene - like sheets of boron , with metal atoms sitting inside and outside the tubes , preserving as much as possible the local atomic environments found in the alb@xmath0 lattice .",
    "_ ab initio _ calculations of their basic electronic properties show that such tubular metal - boron systems are metallic .",
    "there are numerous issues of interest for future studies .",
    "first , a comparison of the properties expected for nanotubes derived from different diboride compounds  including an assessment of which , if any , form stand - alone tubes  would be of interest .",
    "continuing along those lines , it may be possible to tune some of the properties of the metal - boron tubes by forming alloys .",
    "alternatively , substitution of boron atoms by carbon is likely to have a serious impact on the electronic structure of the resulting tubular materials , bringing them closer to bn materials.@xcite also , the recent discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 raises the question of whether some of the diboride - derived tubular materials might superconduct.@xcite finally , and most importantly , we look forward to cooperating with experimental groups that may be able to synthesize tubular metal - boron materials .",
