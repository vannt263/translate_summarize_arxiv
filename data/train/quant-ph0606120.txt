    "the possibility of employing quantum systems with ( finite ) dimension higher than two in quantum information has recently triggered much interest .",

    "considerable experimental progress has been recently reported in the generation , manipulation and detection of quantum systems with higher dimension  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the case of phase covariant transformations where the information is encoded into phase properties of states with arbitrary finite dimension @xmath0 .",
    "encoding information into phase shifts has important applications in quantum computation and quantum information .",
    "for example , it was shown that the existing quantum algorithms can be described in a unified way as quantum interference processes among different computational paths where the result of the computation is retrieved from a phase shift  @xcite .",

    "we will then specify this description to two tasks of interest in quantum information , namely cloning and phase conjugation .",
    "the no cloning theorem  @xcite states the impossibility of perfectly cloning unknown quantum states selected from a nonorthogonal set , and is the basis of the security of quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "approximate quantum cloning has been extensively studied in the last years and has led to relevant results in quantum cryptography .",

    "moreover , quantum cloning allows to study the sharing of quantum information among several parties and it may be applied also to study the security of multi - party cryptographic schemes  @xcite .",
    "perfect phase conjugation of the density operator of an unknown input state , or equivalently ideal time reversal , is also forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "such a transformation has also recently attracted much interest in connection to the problem of entanglement , in regards to the so - called ppt ( positive partial transpose ) criterion  @xcite . since phase conjugation can not be achieved unitarily",

    "this is clearly a much stronger statement than that concerning just fidelities  @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient we need for the proof is that the single - site output state coming from the channel @xmath90 can be parametrised by a shrinking parameter @xmath165 as @xmath166=\\eta_{\\mathcal{c}}|\\psi(\\{\\phi_j\\})\\>\\<\\psi(\\{\\phi_j\\}|+(1-\\eta_{\\mathcal{c}})\\frac{\\openone}{d},\\ ] ] with @xmath167 .",

    "the opposite direction can be proved by concatenating the optimal @xmath63 phase covariant cloner with the optimal _ state _ estimation described in references  @xcite .",
