    "the main goal of these discussions was to study the algebraic properties of @xmath1 and graph theoretic properties of @xmath0 , and to establish the equivalence between the corresponding graph and vector space isomorphisms .",
    "apart from this , we also study basic properties e.g. , completeness , connectedness , domination , chromaticity , maximal cliques , perfectness and maximal independent sets of @xmath0 . as a topic of further research",
    ", one can look into the structure of automorphism groups , hamiltonicity and independence number of @xmath0 .",
