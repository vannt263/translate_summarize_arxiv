    "the pulsar b1509@xmath058 and the supernova remnant ( snr ) g320.4@xmath01.2 ( msh 15@xmath05__2 _ _ ) represent one of approximately 20 known associations between a pulsar and a snr .",
    "this pulsar is one of the most energetic known , with a period ( @xmath7 ) of 150  ms , a period derivative ( @xmath8 ) of 1.2@xmath9  s  s@xmath10 , a characteristic age @xmath11  yr , a spin - down luminosity @xmath12  ergs  s@xmath10 ( for a moment of inertia @xmath13  g  @xmath14 ) , and an inferred dipole surface magnetic field @xmath15  g @xcite .",
    "snr g320.4@xmath01.2 has been well studied at radio , optical , and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the radio morphology consists of a partial shell to the southeast and a series of bright clumps @xmath16 to the northwest @xcite that coincide with the optical nebula rcw  89 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray morphology consists of a bright , elongated pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) with a collimated jet extending @xmath17 to the southeast ( * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , identified several compact knots close to the pulsar , plus two semicircular arcs at a distance of 17@xmath1 and 30@xmath1 to the north of the pulsar .",
    "the toroidal morphology and collimated jet are reminiscent of structures found in the pwne powered by the crab and vela pulsars @xcite .",
    "the arcs have been proposed as being due to ion - compression in the particle - dominated equatorial flow from the pulsar and were interpreted by as analogs of the `` wisps '' found in the crab nebula .",
    "snr g320.4@xmath01.2 has recently been observed in very high energy @xmath18-rays by hess .",
    "the emission is elongated along the pwn axis possibly indicating inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "the structures in the crab and vela pwne are known to vary in brightness and position over short timescales ( days to months ) . in the case of the crab nebula ,",
    "the outward moving x - ray and optical wisps ( with velocity @xmath19 ) are thought to mark the pwn termination shock , while the small - scale x - ray and optical knots are thought to identify unstable , quasi - stationary shocks in the pulsar wind @xcite .",
    "radio wisps , which rarely correspond to optical wisps , develop and move outward at slower velocities ( @xmath20 ) and there are even more slowly moving radio features ( @xmath21 km s@xmath10 ) farther away from the pulsar @xcite .",

    ", the x - ray arcs also move outward and vary in brightness by up to 30% @xcite .",
    "the variability of the vela pwn jet observed in x - rays has been attributed to both kink instabilities , to account for the dramatic shape and brightness changes over the course of days , and sausage instabilities , to account for the relativistically moving `` blobs '' ( @xmath19 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the crab nebula jet , on the other hand , shows only weak x - ray morphological variations on year - long time scales @xcite and relativistic outflow identified in the optical with @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the pwn powered by psr b1509@xmath058 represents a unique opportunity to study variability in pwne .",
    "the physical size of the pwn is approximately 10 and 100 times larger than the crab and vela pwne , respectively .",

    "the flux difference between the 1991/1992 _ rosat _ data and the 2000 _ chandra _ data is slightly greater than the 90% confidence limit .",

    "that model , being a toroidal average , did not predict the angular structure of the arcs uncovered by the new data presented here .",
    "this model depends on the existence of ultra high energy heavy ions being present in the equatorial flow , with the ions carrying a large enough fraction of the energy flux to be able to induce substantial compression in the radiating pair plasma .",
    "the inferred ion number flux , both in the crab and in g320.4@xmath01.2 , is approximately what one expects on electrodynamic grounds , if the ion stream is the electric return current required to prevent the charging up of the neutron stars .",
    "it is not currently understood how the particles in the flow achieve their high energies ( @xmath90 ) , although it has been suggested that they are accelerated and heated by the mysterious dissipation processes that lead to the equatorial wind having magnetization as weak as has been inferred .",
    "these kinetic models focus on the time dependent morphology in and around the termination shock in the pairs  in effect , the ions form part of a resolved shock structure whose basic form is an equatorial ring . the large scale structure of the nebular flow has been addressed in a series of mhd models and simulations , whose focus is on understanding the dramatic pole to equator asymmetry , especially the appearance of the jets @xcite .",
    "these models assume all the particles have small larmor radius , and thus are indifferent to composition and exclude the proposed high energy ions by assumption . with the premise that the injected energy flux decreases with increasing rotational latitude @xmath91 ( usually assumed proportional to @xmath92 ) ,",
    "the energy is mostly injected through a toroidal belt shock , with some flow passing obliquely through a higher latitude `` arch shock '' which , because the shock is oblique to the flow , does not decelerate the plasma to subsonic speeds . these non - spherically symmetric shock structures can create the appearance of an inner ring of emission , with the weakly decelerated plasma emerging from the arch shocks contributing to form the appearance of an outer ring .",
    "doppler boosting may yield an appearance of partial arcs rather than complete rings .",
    "these models provide a plausible scenario for the formation of the jets , as the consequence of backflow and magnetic hoop stress at higher latitudes .",
    "the simulations of this model show no signs of short time variability corresponding to the wisps years ) with some possible shorter time variability when the magnetization is finite but not large  the variability vanishes for unmagnetized flow models .",
    "the physical reasons for this variability are not understood ( bogovalov , private communication ) . ] .",
    "the simulations may lack sufficient resolution to find the kelvin - helmholtz instability between the outward flow emerging from the arch shock and the higher latitude backflow , an effect suggested by @xcite with a somewhat different flow geometry in mind as the origin of the wisps . alternatively , magnetization high enough to form the jet may suppress the shear flow instabilities .",
    "while the effects of high energy equatorial ions have not been explicitly included in the mhd simulations , if present they would be injected into the shock decelerated pairs through the equatorial ring shock seen in the mhd simulations .",
    "thus the formation of ion driven compressions is qualitatively consistent with the mhd models , and remains the only quantitatively elaborated model for the time variability seen in the crab wisps and perhaps seen in the data described here .",
    "based on this model , predicted arc motions of a few arcseconds per year .",
    "we see no outward motion of the outer arc and perhaps even an inward motion .",
    "noted that the positions of the ion driven compressions can move inward as well as outwards , with the apparent motion then depending on when one takes a snapshot of the structure  the possible existence of apparent inward motion , perhaps seen in our data , is a prediction of the model .",
    "however , the apparent motion may also be due to the transverse structural variations in the outer arc between 2000 and 2003  non - axisymmetric variability , a 3d effect , has not been included in any of the models published to date .",
    "if such transverse change is the origin of the apparent motion , the arcs would then be quasi - stationary in the radial sense . or",
    ", we could be witnessing alaising as seen by @xcite in his observations of the wisps in the crab , due to the observations having undersampled the variations .",
    "we can test whether the quasi - stationary nature of the outer arc is due to aliasing .",
    "if we assume that the particles comprising the outer arc are relativistic , and thus doppler boosted , then we can determine a speed based on the brightness ratio of @xmath93 between the near and far sides .",
    "for a photon index of 1.6 , the doppler boosting formula reduces to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the inclination angle to the line - of - sight . if the inclination of the outer arc is 60@xmath61 ( oriented 90@xmath61 from the jet ) , then @xmath97 . at this speed",
    ", we expect the outer arc to move nearly 16@xmath1 in 3 years , which is slightly greater than the width of the arc .",

    ", the arc would only move 1@xmath996 in 6 months .",
    "this amount of motion is difficult to rule in or out given the degree of structural change in the outer arc and the signal - to - noise ratio of the data .",
    "the nature of arc a and arc b is unknown .",
    "if indeed the arcs are outward - moving structures , then perhaps arc a and arc b are just more evolved versions of the inner and outer arcs .",
    "they could also represent a quasi - coherent oscillation of the flow in the outer pwn as observed in the simulations of @xcite .",

    "the time scale for such phenomena is set by the alfvn crossing time @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the cylindrical radius of the jet and @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the relativistic pressure , assumed to be isotropic , and @xmath104 is the energy density of the relativistic plasma . shown in table [ alfven ]",

    "position 1 is closest to the pulsar and we are assuming a cylindrical volume . the magnetic fields and energy densities are computed from equipartition arguments using integrated fluxes for the energy range 0.5 - 10 kev and assuming an uncooled spectrum @xcite . for all regions @xmath105 and the alfvn crossing times vary from 1.3@xmath02 years .",
    "thus the mhd instability of a magnetic pinch , the basic structure of the jet described in the mhd models , certainly is a viable candidate for the jet variations observed between 2000 and 2003 , and perhaps may be a candidate to explain the partial brightening of the jet from 1991/1992 to 1994 and 2000 . indeed , episodic jet outflows are observed in mhd simulations for certain magnetic field configurations @xcite .",
    "if we interpret the jet structural changes between 2000 and 2003 as clump motion along the jet , then the resulting velocity is @xmath4 0.5c .",
    "this velocity is consistent with the prediction of based on doppler boosting and also matches the outflow speeds observed in the crab nebula jet ( 0.4c , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the vela pwn jet ( @xmath106 , * ? ? ? * ) , and in the jet of g11.2@xmath00.3 ( @xmath107 , * ? ? ?",
    "relativistic jet outflow velocities of @xmath3 are predicted by the mhd simulations described above @xcite .",
    "the jet brightnening from 1991/1992 to 1994 and 2000 can not simply be a result of material moving at @xmath108 down the jet causing the jet to lengthen and brighten with the inclusion of more material .",
    "this scenario is excluded for two reasons , the first is that it would take nearly 80 years for material moving at @xmath108 to travel the length of the jet , and the second is that the jet seems to brighten in a `` patchy '' manner and does not simply lengthen , as shown in figure [ rcjet ] .",
    "therefore , as discussed above , the brightening of the jet is more likely the result of an mhd instability such as a magnetic pinch . in this model ,",
    "the instability causes compression and brightening of local regions , each of which has length no more than the jet diameter .",
    "there is no necessity for the energy to be injected into the jet at a varying rate , with the observed variations reflecting transport along the jet .",
    "this scenario works because the alfvn transit time _ across _",
    "the jet is much shorter than the flow time along the jet .",
    "the model suggests that the clumps vary incoherently with respect to each other , on a time scale approximately equal to the alfvn crossing time ( @xmath109 years ) , consistent with the very limited time series available to us .      the compact , small - scale knots near the pulsar are quite variable on 6 month timescales . although the knot to the southeast of the pulsar might represent material moving at 0.6c , given the startling knot variability to the northwest , a conclusion of knot motion is perhaps premature .",
    "we can estimate the magnetic fields in the knots in three ways : 1 .",
    "assume that the knot size is approximately the larmor radius of gyrating pairs , 2 .",
    "use equipartition / minimum energy , and 3 .",
    "use synchrotron lifetime if the knots are in motion at 0.6c and cool below detectability at a distance of the inner arc in time frames from 6 months to 1 year .",
    "for the first method , derived a magnetic field of 3@xmath110 g from the larmor radius for their knot  1 .",
    "for the second method , the magnetic field derived from minimum energy using a size of 0.1 pc and the integrated flux of knot  1 from for the energy range of 0.5@xmath010.0  kev is @xmath111 g .",
    "for the third method , the synchrotron lifetime can be calculated using ( from equation 4 of ) @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the magnetic field in @xmath110 g and @xmath114 is the energy in kev . for 5 kev and @xmath115 year , @xmath116 g .",
    "given this high magnetic field , it seems unlikely that synchrotron cooling could be responsible for the transient nature of the knots .",
    "the knots may have a similar explanation as `` knot 2 '' in the crab nebula which has been interpreted as an unstable quasi - stationary shock in the polar jet outflow @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", one would expect the bulk of the knots to be in the approaching jet since the receding jet is doppler boosted down in brightness .",
    "however , in this case we observe most of the knot structure on the receding jet side .",
    "given that the knots are never observed beyond the inner arc radius and most of them occur on the approaching side of the arcs , it is likely that the knots are either associated with the equatorial outflow or the resulting backflow as described in  [ sec : disarcs ] and shown in figure  3 of @xcite .",
    "two processes expected from the relativistic mhd simulations that could produce `` knot - like '' emission are kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities arising in the shear layer between the equatorial outflow and the backflow and unsteady vortices that develop in the converging flow at the base of the jet .    the kh instability creates waves that may grow and break , while traveling in the direction of the mass weighted jump in velocity across the interface between the outflow and backflow .",
    "doppler boosting as the breaking waves head toward us , and plasma and b field compression as the waves break , may lead to the formation of bright features that can appear to us as localized bright spots of emission .",
    "the main difficulty with this idea is that within the flow models , the mass weighted velocity jump is directed toward us only on the near ( visible jet ) side except very close in to the base of the jets .",
    "this is because flow convergence increases the mass density in the layer that converges on the axis at small distance from the axis , while the outflowing layer has low density at small radii . at larger radii ,",
    "the relative densities of the layers reverses .",
    "thus this effect will work only if there is a lot of flow convergence .",
    "the converging flow at the base of the jet could also produce transient features due to the development of unstable vortices ( n. bucciantini , private communication ) .",
    "the backflow would need to focus quite well toward the base of the jet to produce doppler boosting of flows directed towards us and may be rather sensitive to the maintenance of axisymmetry",
    ". however , this hypothesis naturally explains the relative absence of knots on the near ( visible ) jet side since the converging flow at the base of the approaching jet would be directed away from us .",
    "regardless of the actual cause of the knots , they seem to be diagnostic of flow details in the pwn . to determine the true nature of the knots will require much higher resolution simulations and more analysis of the flow models .      determined that the synchrotron cooling time for the jet at 5 kev and a magnetic field of @xmath117 g is 140 years .",
    "this cooling should result in a @xmath84 of 0.5 @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is a marginal indication of cooling in the jet with a total @xmath84 of 0.43 .",
    "we await analysis of the new , longer _",
    "observation to verify the possible synchrotron cooling in the jet .",
    "the relativistic mhd simulations do predict that the jet should undergo synchrotron cooling , although there is mixing with the ambient pwn material ( s. komissarov , private communication ) . at the base of the jet",
    ", the photon index should match that of the equatorial outflow since the jet is constructed from purloined equatorial material .",
    "if we assume that the inner and outer arcs identify the equatorial outflow material , then their photon index of 1.6 does nearly match the photon index of 1.5 at the base of the jet . if the spectral steepening along the jet is real , it would be similar to that observed in the crab nebula jet ( @xmath118 ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectral steepening with increasing radius has been observed in a number of pwne and is generally attributed to both synchrotron cooling and expansion losses @xcite .",
    "the degree of steepening varies from @xmath119 to 1.3 with a typical value of 1 and the radial photon index profiles generally show a monotonic increase with radius . our spectral results for the diffuse component of the pwn of g320.4@xmath01.2 also show a monotonic increase of photon index with radius if we allow the absorption to vary , but the degree of steepening ( @xmath120 ) is less than in other pwne .",
    "in contrast , models for synchrotron cooling in pwne based on the @xcite model predict a rapid increase in photon index at large radius @xcite .",
    "perhaps the discrepancy between the cooling model and the observations is due to large - scale mixing of recently accelerated material with `` older '' material as predicted by the relativistic mhd models @xcite .",
    "variability is observed in the x - ray pwn of psr b1509@xmath058 on time scales possibly as short as one week and up to twelve years .",
    "our primary results are as follows :    1 .   the compact , small - scale knots appearing within 20@xmath1 of the pulsar exhibit transient behavior which may be attributed to turbulence in the flows surrounding the pulsar .",
    "possible knot motion is indicated with a velocity of @xmath121 .",
    "apparent outflow along the jet is observed with velocities of @xmath3 .",
    "this outflow alone can not account for the @xmath430% brightening of the jet between 1991/1992 and 2000 .",
    "the alfvn crossing time for the jet is 1.3@xmath02 years , therefore , mhd kink or sausage instabilities can account for the rapid morphological variations and perhaps the partial jet brightening .",
    "the outer arc has possibly moved inward with a velocity of @xmath80 , however the transverse structural changes seen in the outer arc may account for the apparent motion .",
    "we can not determine at this time if the outer arc is truly quasi - stationary or if we are witnessing aliasing .",
    "the diffuse pwn has not evolved significantly in structure or brightness over the 12-year time span . using the summed _",
    "images , we identify two possible arc structures exterior to the outer arc .",
    "the photon indices of the diffuse pwn and possibly the jet steepen with increasing radius indicating synchrotron cooling at x - ray energies .",
    "although our imaging capabilities have improved substantially since the first optical observations of time variability in the crab nebula @xcite , our understanding of these variations in pwne is still quite limited .",
    "for instance , while we expect magnetic fields to play an important dynamical role in jets , and indeed we do see variations on the appropriate alfvn crossing times , we do not know for certain if mhd instabilities are the root cause of the observed variations .",
    "the arc structures we observe in g320.4@xmath01.2 are equally enigmatic .",
    "we do not yet know if they are in steady motion or are quasi - stationary wave phenomena .",
    "the striking changes in the small - scale knots near the pulsar may simply be `` weather , '' diagnosing unimportant details in the pwn flow , or they may indicate important flow structure which is essential to understanding , for instance , diffusion of particles from the equatorial flow to higher latitudes , a loss essential to a post pair shock second - order fermi acceleration model .",
    "certainly deeper , and appropriately spaced , x - ray observations will help resolve some issues such as the possible spatial aliasing of the outer arc . also , the higher signal - to - noise will provide better constraints on the spatial spectral index variations and allow us to determine if and how much mixing has occurred in the diffuse pwn .",
    "finally , we are excited by the recent development of relativistic mhd models and we hope that some of the variability we observe here can eventually be observed in those simulations .",

    "<S> we use new and archival _ chandra _ and _ rosat _ data to study the time variability of the x - ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) powered by psr b1509@xmath058 on timescales of one week to twelve years </S>",
    "<S> . there is variability in the size , number , and brightness of compact knots appearing within 20@xmath1 of the pulsar , with at least one knot showing a possible outflow velocity of @xmath2 ( assuming a distance to the source of 5.2 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transient nature of these knots may indicate that they are produced by turbulence in the flows surrounding the pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> a previously identified prominent jet extending 12 pc to the southeast of the pulsar increased in brightness by 30% over 9 years ; apparent outflow of material along this jet is observed with a velocity of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , outflow alone can not account for the changes in the jet on such short timescales . </S>",
    "<S> magnetohydrodynamic sausage or kink instabilities are feasible explanations for the jet variability with timescale of @xmath4 1.3@xmath02 years . </S>",
    "<S> an arc structure , located 30@xmath5 north of the pulsar , shows transverse structural variations and appears to have moved inward with a velocity of @xmath6 over three years . </S>",
    "<S> the overall structure and brightness of the diffuse pwn exterior to this arc and excluding the jet has remained the same over the twelve year span . </S>",
    "<S> the photon indices of the diffuse pwn and possibly the jet steepen with increasing radius , likely indicating synchrotron cooling at x - ray energies . </S>"
