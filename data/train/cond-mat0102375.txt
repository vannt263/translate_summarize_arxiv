    "the feature at high temperatures is explained as follows . at high temperatures ,",
    "the bounce solution becomes independent of @xmath71 , since the interval in the @xmath88 direction becomes short .",
    "it means that the temporal dimension become irrelevant .",
    "hence , the relevant dimension of the bounce is reduced from @xmath15 to @xmath95 . except for the absence of the temporal dimension",
    ", we can discuss the dimensional crossover in the same way as sec .",
    "[ sec : dimcross ] : the energy barrier behaves as @xmath188 for the weak impurity , while as @xmath189 for the strong impurity .",
    "the barrier height is calculated in a form @xmath190 the impurity effects appear only through the normalized potential barrier @xmath191 .",
    "we show @xmath191 as a function of the effective impurity strength @xmath133 in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal ] by the square dots .",
    "the critical impurity strength is given by @xmath192 which is the same as the quantum tunneling regime .",
    "the exponent is obtained analytically for the weak impurity @xmath118 as @xmath193 while for the strong impurity @xmath194 as @xmath195 these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal ] by the dashed and solid curves .",
    "the feature of the impurity effect is the same as the zero - temperature case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsplot ] .",
    "first , let us discuss the two - dimensional systems .",
    "the stable solution @xmath197 is determined by @xmath198 where the last term describes the impurity located at @xmath199 . for the stationary solution having a rotational symmetry around the origin @xmath200 ,",
    "this equation is reduced , by using the radius coordinate @xmath201 , to @xmath202 here , @xmath203 is a modified delta function satisfying @xmath204 for @xmath205 , @xmath206 for @xmath207 , and @xmath208 from ( [ eq : bounce3d ] ) and ( [ deltag ] ) , the boundary condition at @xmath207 is obtained as @xmath209 since the function @xmath210 is a continuous function at @xmath205 , if we take an arbitrary constant @xmath2 ( @xmath211 ) , there exists a constant @xmath212 , and for all @xmath213 in the range @xmath214 @xmath215 is satisfied . as a result , @xmath216 is evaluated for @xmath217 as @xmath218 and the value of @xmath160 diverges at @xmath207 . since @xmath160 must be finite in the present model , this divergence means that the local inhomogeneity can not be described by the delta function in the two - dimensional systems . in other words , if we approximate the delta function as @xmath219 for @xmath220 and as @xmath221 for @xmath222 , the value of @xmath223 depends crucially on the impurity size @xmath224 , and diverges in the limit @xmath225 . also in the @xmath226 case , the field @xmath216 diverges at @xmath207 , since the bounce solution behaves @xmath227 near @xmath207 , where @xmath228 ,    these results indicate that in the highly - biased region , the system is sensitive to local inhomogeneities . to clarify the inhomogeneity effects in the @xmath196 case",
    ", it is needed to consider the detailed profiles of the inhomogeneities beyond the local approximation adopted in this paper .      in this paper , the nucleation rate",
    "is calculated by the bounce method .",
    "although this method has been applied to multi - variable tunneling problems for many years , we should be careful of its validity . in principle",
    ", the exact tunneling rate should be determined by the full information about the action @xmath229 $ ] .",
    "the bounce solution can extract important informations from the action ; the exponent @xmath1 is a difference of the action between the bounce and stable solutions , while the prefactor @xmath2 is determined by the second - order fluctuations around both the solutions . while the bounce method is a convenient method to evaluate the tunneling rate , some informations which may affect the tunneling rate",
    "are dropped .",
    "it is expected that the bounce method can be justified in the following conditions @xcite : ( 1 ) we can define the tunneling variable describing slow dynamics among the many degrees of freedom , and ( 2 ) this tunneling variable is well separated from the other variables with fast dynamics . in these conditions , the system can be reduced to the one - variable tunneling problem where the bounce method is justified well . here",
    ", let us consider the model adopted in this paper .",
    "for the strong impurity , it has been shown that the single - mode approximation gives a good estimate of the exponent @xmath1 . in this region ,",
    "the bounce method is expected to give correct results for both the exponent and the prefactor for @xmath230 , though the crossover length @xmath12 itself can not be evaluated . for the moderate impurity",
    ", however , there appears another low - frequency mode related to the goldstone mode .",
    "this low - frequency mode is expected to couple with the tunneling mode .",
    "hence , the bounce method may give an incorrect result especially for the prefactor determined only by the information about second - order fluctuations .",
    "it is a future problem to improve the bounce method in this situation .",
    "the local inhomogeneity effects on nucleation processes have been studied within the bounce method at high biases .",
    "the nucleation rate has been calculated in a form @xmath231 .",
    "it has been found that the effective impurity strength @xmath133 can be controlled not only by the bare impurity strength @xmath44 but also by the external bias @xmath6 .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 has been calculated as a function of the effective impurity strength @xmath133 without reduction to a single - variable tunneling problem .",
    "it has been shown that these results are well reproduced for the weak impurity by a perturbational analysis and for the strong impurity by a one - mode approximation .",
    "it has been clarified that the results can be explained by the reduction of the effective dimensionality of the system due to the impurity . by calculating the prefactor @xmath2 , the condition of the appearance of the impurity effects has been discussed , and the phase diagram has been obtained .",
    "there remain future problems .",
    "one of them is to study the inhomogeneity effect in higher - dimensional systems . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , the local approximation does not hold for the @xmath103 case . from this result , it is conjectured that the sample inhomogeneities may become essentially important for higher - dimensional systems .",
    "i think that the study of the inhomogeneity effects in high - dimensional systems would give an important aspect about the interplay of quantum tunneling and randomness .",
    "i wish to acknowledge m. yumoto for suggestions and helpful discussions .",
    "in this paper , the inhomogeneity effect is described by the potential @xmath232 if the function @xmath233 changes only in a narrow region at the impurity site compared with the typical length scale ( @xmath234 ) , it can be replaced with the delta function @xmath40 in ( [ vimp ] ) . the potential form ( [ eq : vimp3 ] ) can be realized in various experimental situations .",
    "one typical example is a spatial inhomogeneity of the bias .",
    "if the bias is assumed not to be uniform but to have a spatial dependence as @xmath235 , then we have the potential form ( [ eq : vimp3 ] ) .",
    "another example is the inhomogeneity of the amplitude of the potential barrier in @xmath20 .",
    "if we replace , for example , the cosine potential in ( [ eq : pot1 ] ) with @xmath236 , then the form ( [ eq : vimp3 ] ) is also obtained . as for the josephson junction systems , the coupling to the derivative of the field @xmath237",
    "can also be introduced by applying the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "if the coupling is denoted with @xmath238 , the potential form ( [ eq : vimp3 ] ) is derived by taking the function @xmath233 as @xmath239 .",
    "in addition to the above situations , boundaries play a role of local inhomogeneities . the potential barrier @xmath55 is reduced to @xmath240 at open edge .",
    "hence , the nucleation occurs dominantly at the boundary .",
    "the prefactor @xmath2 of the nucleation rate is always independent of the system size , while the exponent @xmath1 is affected by the boundary condition . assuming that the field @xmath241 is defined at @xmath242 , and that the boundary condition is given as @xmath243 it can be shown easily that this boundary effect corresponds to the local inhomogeneity by taking @xmath244 .",
    "thus , the exponent @xmath245 is obtained as @xmath246 by changing the boundary condition at the edge , the impurity effects on the exponent can also be observed .",
    "actually , this tendency has been observed in experiments @xcite .",
