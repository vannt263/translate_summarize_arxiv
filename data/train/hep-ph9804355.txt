    "we will be concerned with new sources of cp violation in the higgs sector of susy models .    despite the large number of new phases in the model as a whole",
    ", it is well known that in the minimal susy extension of the standard model ( mssm ) the tree level higgs potential contains just one complex parameter , the term @xmath1 .",
    "even this phase can be removed by redefinitions of the higgs fields .",
    "then the vacuum expectation values of the higgs scalars will be real , with no mixing between the physical scalar and pseudoscalar higgs fields .    at one loop",
    "the situation is different . in section  2",
    "we will demonstrate that sizable higgs sector cp violation can be induced at one - loop , even within the mssm , and especially so at large @xmath2 .",
    "one place where cp - violating effects can manifest themselves is in the couplings of the lightest neutral higgs boson to standard model fermions .",
    "in fact , we will see that these are in principle accessible at a suggested muon collider operating on the higgs resonance , at least in some regions of the susy parameter space .",
    "alternatively , in variations of the mssm with extended higgs sectors ( such as the so - called nmssm , defined below ) the tree - level higgs potential contains irremovable cp violating phases .",
    "then substantial cp violation is possible even for small @xmath2 .",
    "the possible magnitude of cp violation in the higgs sector is severely constrained by experimental limits on electric dipole moments ( edms ) of fermions .",
    "this is because the same diagrams that contribute to the cp - violating higgs couplings also contribute to the edms of fermions . as we discuss in section  3 , current bounds on the @xmath3edm do little to constrain our scenario , but within the mssm",
    ", bounds on the @xmath4edm are highly constraining given minimal theoretical prejudices . in section  3",
    "we therefore also discuss how observation of cp violation , or lack thereof , in the higgs - lepton coupling fits into the broader picture painted by flavor - changing and cp - violation constraints on susy extensions of the standard model .",
    "we emphasize that cp violation in the higgs - fermion couplings is a way of discriminating the mssm from more elaborate extensions , such as the nmssm .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  4 .",
    "though most of our discussion is phrased in terms of the coupling of the lightest neutral higgs , @xmath0 , to charged leptons , much of our analysis applies more generally with only slight alterations to higgs - quark couplings .",
    "there are also potentially interesting effects of cp violation in the heavy higgs sector , which are under study .",
    "let us first discuss the situation in the minimal supersymemtric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .    in the absence of susy breaking , the charged leptons couple to the higgs field @xmath5 , but not @xmath6 .",
    "after susy breaking , a coupling of the leptons to @xmath6 is generated at one loop , and in general it will not be real , due to phases in the soft - breaking parameters and the @xmath3 term .",
    "the resulting coupling of the lepton to the higgs fields is of the form = a|_l_r h_d^0+b|_l_r h_u^0*+h.c .",
    "[ eq : leff ] by redefining lepton fields while keeping the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields real , we may choose @xmath7 real but must then allow @xmath8 to be complex .",
    "the resulting lepton mass term is then :- breaking , one should write one set of terms for the lepton mass generation and another set for their yukawa couplings to the higgses .",
    "however , if the electroweak symmetry - breaking effects are small ( @xmath9 smaller than @xmath10 ) , both the mass term and the higgs coupling will to a good approximation arise from the terms in eq .",

    "+ & = & ( av_d+bv_u)|+i(av_d+bv_u)|^5  , where @xmath11 . in the standard model with only one higgs doublet , no physical cp violation can arise from the higgs coupling , because the same rotations that make the lepton masses real also make their couplings to the neutral higgs particle real .",
    "but in this two - doublet extension the fermion masses do not correspond directly to the couplings to the physical higgs states . specifically",
    ", we can write ( h_u^0 ) & = & ( h^0 + h^0 ) + ( h_d^0 ) & = & ( - h^0 + h^0 ) where @xmath12 .    here , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we have made the good approximation of omitting additional `` pseudoscalar '' components on the right hand side . in principle one",
    "loop contributions to the higgs effective potential can spontaneously break cp  @xcite , and/or communicate explicit cp - violation in the soft masses and @xmath3-term to the higgs sector . in either case ,",
    "a small phase in the higgs vacuum expectation values is induced which leads to scalar - pseudoscalar mixing , but this effect is @xmath13 , too small to affect our conclusions .",
    "a relative phase between @xmath14 and @xmath15 arises in the mssm when a higgs quartic coupling term @xmath16 is induced , but since supersymmetry is broken softly , such quartic terms arise from finite box graphs , which lead to a very small coefficient .    since the transformations that eliminate phases in the lepton and quark masses",
    "do not eliminate phases from their couplings to @xmath0 and @xmath17 , there is a residual violation of cp . in order to extract the cp violating portion of the @xmath18 coupling",
    ", we must look for some mismatch between its phase and the phase of the @xmath19 mass term .",
    "it is convenient to write the higgs coupling and mass terms in the forms @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , where & = & + & = & .",

    "this is the well - known higgs decoupling limit of the mssm in which the second doublet becomes much heavier than the weak scale ( @xmath27 ) so that the low - energy higgs sector closely approximates that of the sm .",
    "the higgs mixing angle aligns itself with that of the fermion mass terms so that the fermions effectively couple to only one scalar higgs field , allowing all phases to be removed .",
    "we are interested in the cp violation in the higgs sector arising from the one loop induced parameter @xmath8 .",
    "representatives of the two basic classes of diagrams that contribute to the @xmath28 amplitudes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "these are in the same class of diagrams whose real parts have been studied both in certain fermion mass generation scenarios  @xcite and have been found to significantly shift the @xmath8-quark mass at large @xmath2  @xcite ; here we will confine ourselves to the leptonic sector of the theory and study the imaginary parts of the diagrams .",
    "we will only work to leading order in the slepton , neutralino and chargino mixing , which is to say @xmath29 , and in the limit of @xmath30 .",

    "scaled by the appropriate @xmath126 , this limit approaches within a factor of 10 that already obtained for the electron .",
    "if a non - zero @xmath3edm were to be measured , this would strongly bolster the case for observable cp violation in the direct higgs - muon coupling .",
    "conversely , non - observation would produce a strong bound , essentially equivalent to the @xmath127 @xmath4edm bound shown in figure  [ fig : edm](a ) , making it unlikely that cp - violation in the mssm higgs - muon coupling could be observed .",
    "we should take a moment to comment on the heavy mass limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : edm](a ) clearly shows that edm constraints do / will require either very small phases or very heavy sparticles . in the case of small phases , @xmath51 is similarly small .",
    "however , heavy masses do not necessarily imply small @xmath51 , which is to say that this is an example of a susy non - decoupling effect .",
    "it is easy to understand why we do not find decoupling . in particular , if one takes @xmath53 large along with the susy masses , leaving only a one higgs doublet standard model at low energies , then these effects do decouple by virtue of the fact that in a one higgs doublet model all cp violation can be eliminated through field redefinitions .",
    "the same is _ not _ true in a two higgs doublet version of the standard model , which is what one has for light @xmath53 .",
    "now when the susy states are integrated out , they generate cp - violating @xmath18 terms in the lagrangian of the two doublet model . because this higgs coupling is marginal ( renormalizable ) ,",
    "those couplings are only logarithmically sensitive to the susy scale .",
    "this is in contrast to the edm operator , @xmath128 , which is irrelevant ( non - renormalizable ) and therefore flows quickly to zero in the infrared as @xmath129 .",
    "do such large susy masses make sense ?",
    "the main `` esthetic '' or `` naturality '' constraint on supersymmetric partner masses is that they not induce too large a correction to the higgs ( mass)@xmath130 parameter through diagrams which grow quadratically with the mass of the superpartner .",
    "the one - loop contributions of the selectrons and smuons to the higgs ( mass)@xmath130 parameter are proportional to their relatively small yukawa couplings , allowing one to satisfy the naturality constraint with masses as large as @xmath131 .",
    "( by way of contrast , the third generation squarks and sleptons as well as the gauginos , because of their @xmath132 couplings to the higgs , must have masses @xmath133 .",
    ") however , there are two - loop contributions involving the light generation sfermions not proportional to their small yukawa couplings , and naturality  @xcite and vacuum stability@xcite require that these sfermion masses be below about @xmath134 .",
    "thus it is not immediately clear whether one should consider smuon masses such as those demanded by figure  [ fig : edm](a ) to be unnatural or not .",
    "( note that if the gaugino masses are @xmath135 , but 1st and 2nd generation scalars have masses in the @xmath136 range , then @xmath51 in the mssm is suppressed by a factor of @xmath137 ; see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] )  ( [ eq : a3 ] ) . )    however , as we now explain , under some reasonable assumptions concerning the susy spectrum , the constraint on the @xmath4edm can be used to constrain the @xmath3edm already .",
    "this is because the phase that enters the leptonic coupling via @xmath54 is universal  all sleptons receive exactly the same phase .",
    "there can be non - universal phases coming from the trilinear @xmath32-terms , but they are not enhanced at large @xmath2 , and unless one assumes some kind of cancellation , the size of the cp - violating phases of the various sleptons are correlated . furthermore ,",
    "if the smuon and selectron are approximately degenerate , then the constraint on the @xmath4edm translates directly into a constraint on the muon - higgs coupling .",
    "it implies for one thing that @xmath138 cm , which means that the bnl e821 experiment  @xcite looking for a non - zero @xmath3edm should obtain a null result .",
    "it also means that the current limit on the @xmath4edm already constrains the cp violation in the mssm higgs - muon coupling to be unobservable at a higgs factory , even without any improvement in the @xmath3edm measurement .",
    "why should we assume that the smuons and sleptons will be degenerate ?",
    "non - degenerate sleptons generically lead to large flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) , specifically @xmath139 .",
    "very heavy sleptons could also account for the lack of fcnc s in leptonic processes , but if the sleptons are non - degenerate then it is natural to expect the same for the squarks , and there the constraints are much stronger . in particular , in the presence of generic cp - violating phases , @xmath140-squark masses would have to exceed approximately @xmath141  @xcite in order to agree with the measured cp violation in the kaon system , specifically @xmath142 .",
    "this is far above any possible definition of a natural squark mass and we do not consider this possibility further .",
    "there is also the possibility that the new contributions to @xmath143 could be eliminated through alignment of the quark / squark mass matrices  @xcite , but to our knowledge no very attractive model has been built along these lines .",
    "thus we are left with degeneracy in the squark sector as by far the most attractive solution to the dual problems of fcnc s and @xmath143 , and by extension degeneracy becomes the most attractive scenario for the sleptons as well .",
    "the preceding discussion of degeneracy really only applies to the first two generations of sparticles . the third generation ,",
    "thanks to its small quark mixings with the other generations , has suppressed contributions to fcnc s and @xmath143",
    ". it would not be difficult to imagine , for example , that the first two generations of sleptons are degenerate and heavy , while the third is much lighter .",
    "in that case the constraint from the @xmath4edm would not limit cp violation in the @xmath110 sector and so the decay @xmath111 may be a likely place to observe violation of cp .",
    "( if @xmath144 , then the @xmath4edm constraint does apply , leaving little room for cp violation in the higgs-@xmath110 coupling . )",
    "the situation for the nmssm and other extensions is slightly different .",
    "first , we emphasize that the edm _ constraints _ on the ( tree - level ) phase are essentially identical ( for a given susy spectrum ) to the constraint on the size of cp - violating phases in the mssm . indeed , after suitable field redefinitions , this phase of the nmssm can be moved into a phase of the effective @xmath3-term , @xmath145 .",
    "consequently , _ precisely _ the same diagrams contribute to the edms in the nmssm as in the mssm .",
    "the only difference , a minor one , is that the neutralino mass matrix is now a @xmath146 matrix ; in the limit of fixed @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the contributions involving the @xmath76 component of the neutralino to the edm are suppressed , and one recovers exactly the structure arising in the mssm .",
    "nevertheless , as we discussed in sections  [ sec : nmssm]-[sec : collider ] , there are two important differences between the mssm and nmssm .",
    "first , in the nmssm the cp violation in the higgs - lepton couplings is neither enhanced nor diminished by @xmath2 since it is a tree - level effect .",
    "therefore one does not require very large values of @xmath2 in order to obtain observable violations of cp .",
    "from the point of view of the edm constraints , however , it is advantageous to have small @xmath2 .",
    "this is clear when comparing figures  [ fig : edm](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "for the same phase , the mass bounds at @xmath149 are roughly four times weaker than those at @xmath115 .",
    "thus the constraint coming from naturalness ( , demanding light scalar masses ) is less restricting at small @xmath2 , allowing in turn larger underlying phases and thus larger @xmath89 .",
    "a second difference is that in the nmssm cp - violating couplings of the higgs particles to fermions occur at tree - level .",
    "thus there are no loop suppressions which suppress @xmath89 with respect to the edm .",
    "the final effect of these differences is that for scalar masses in the range 1 to @xmath150 , the underlying cp - violating phases in the nmssm can be @xmath55 and thus @xmath151 as well . even for sleptons in the @xmath152 mass range",
    ", it is quite natural to expect @xmath153 , which can easily be probed in a single year at a muon collider of current conservative design parameters ( see figure  [ fig : alr ] ) .",
    "this is contrasted with the much smaller value ( @xmath154 ) expected in the mssm .",
    "indeed , one can take advantage of this difference and use a combination of edm and cp - violating muon - higgs coupling measurements to discriminate between the mssm and its extensions .",
    "in this paper we have shown that at 1-loop a potentially large cp - violating coupling of the higgs to sm fermions is induced in the mssm .",
    "the cp - violating coupling to muons , @xmath59 , could be accessed cleanly through the polarization - dependent production asymmetry at a muon collider operating on the higgs resonance . however , by imposing reasonable theoretical expectations , the motivations for which were discussed in section  [ sec : edm ] , together with the current bounds on the @xmath4edm , we found stringent constraints on the size of @xmath59 in the mssm .",
    "we argued that the cp - violating coupling of third generation fermions to the higgs could be substantial nevertheless . in simple , natural extensions of the mssm , such as the nmssm",
    ", cp - violating couplings of @xmath0 to sm fermions occur at tree level , and large cp violation is plausible for the higgs couplings of all three generations of sm fermions , even after imposing the @xmath4edm constraints .",
    "in particular , cp - violating signals at a muon collider of @xmath155 are not ruled out .",
