    "the understanding of transport properties of low - dimensional systems with strong correlations still poses viable challenges to theorists .",
    "these include , on the one hand , the fundamental problem of calculating transport coefficients for generic models such as the heisenberg chain,@xcite and on the other hand , the theoretical modeling of experiments that typically require the treatment of spin or electronic degrees of freedom coupled to phonons , in particular , in the case of the thermal conductivity.@xcite most theoretical work has focussed on the linear - response regime , in which the properties of current - current autocorrelation functions determine transport properties ( see refs .   for a review ) .",
    "more recently , the out - of - equilibrium properties of one - dimensional systems have evolved into an active field of research , one reason being recent advances in experiments with ultracold atoms.@xcite these have paved the way for studying the dynamics of quantum many - body systems that are driven far away from equilibrium in a controlled manner , with little or no coupling to external degrees of freedom .",
    "much attention has been paid to the question of thermalization , typically studied in so - called quantum quenches ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "while global quantum quenches in homogeneous systems usually do not induce any finite net currents ( of either spin , energy , or particles ) , we will be particularly interested in set - ups that feature finite net - currents .",
    "such situations are realized in , for instance , the sudden expansion of particles in optical lattices after the removal of trapping potentials.@xcite further examples are spin and/or particle currents induced by connecting two regions with opposite magnetizations or by letting two particle clouds collide ( see , for instance , refs .  ) .",
    "theoretical work in this context ranges from the expansion dynamics of bosons and fermions in optical lattices@xcite over the dynamics of wave - packets in spin chains,@xcite to the demonstration of signatures of spin - charge separation in such set - ups.@xcite in the aforementioned examples , non - equilibrium situations were studied with either finite _ spin _ or _ particle _ currents . in our work , we address the _ energy _",
    "dynamics for a model that is prototypical for systems with strong correlations , namely the spin-1/2 xxz chain : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the components of a spin-@xmath0 operator acting on site @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding lowering / raising operators .",
    "the global energy scale is set by the exchange coupling @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the exchange anisotropy in the @xmath8-direction , and @xmath9 denotes the number of sites .",
    "equation   describes either interacting quantum spins or , via the jordan - wigner transformation,@xcite spinless fermions .    specifically , we follow the time - evolution of the local energy density @xmath10 starting from initial states that are far from the ground state of eq .   and that feature an inhomogeneous profile in the local energy density ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] for a sketch ) .",
    "we emphasize that , in the main part of our work , we choose the initial conditions such that _ only _ finite energy currents exist , whereas the spin ( particle ) density is constant during the time evolution , hence all spin ( particle ) currents vanish .",
    "obviously , an initial state with an inhomogeneous spin density profile leads to both finite spin _ and _ energy currents , and we revisit this case , previously studied in refs .   and , as well .",
    "our work is motivated by and closely related to a specific experiment on a spin - ladder material .",
    "many low - dimensional quantum magnets are known to be very good thermal conductors with heat predominantly carried by magnetic excitations at elevated temperatures.@xcite examples for materials that exhibit particularly large thermal conductivities are ( sr , la , ca)@xmath11cu@xmath12o@xmath13 ( refs .   and ) and srcuo@xmath14 ( ref .  ) .",
    "while these experiments are carried out under steady - state conditions and in the regime of small external perturbations , more recently , time - resolved measurements have been performed on la@xmath15ca@xmath16cu@xmath12o@xmath13 ( ref .  ) . for this spin ladder material ,",
    "two approaches have been implemented : a time - of - flight measurement , in which one side of the sample is heated up with a laser pulse and the time - dependent response is recorded on the other side .",
    "second , a non - equilibrium local heat distribution was generated in the surface of the material by shining laser light on it .",
    "it is possible to record the heat dynamics via thermal imaging that uses the response of an excited thin fluorescent layer placed on top of the spin ladder material .",
    "it is the latter case that we mimic in our work : the time evolution of local energy densities induced by inhomogeneous initial distributions .",
    "we utilize the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg)@xcite technique .",
    "it allows us to simulate the dynamics of pure states whereas in the experiment , temperature likely plays a role .",
    "our work thus addresses qualitative aspects in the first place , while a direct comparison with experimental results is beyond the scope of this study : the goal is to demonstrate that in a spin-1/2 chain described by eq .",
    ", the energy dynamics is ballistic , irrespective of how far from equilibrium the system is and also irrespective of the presence or absence of excitation gaps . to this end",
    ", we use the same approach as in ref .  :",
    "we classify the dynamics based on the behavior of the spatial variance @xmath17 of the local energy density : the ballistic case is @xmath18 , whereas diffusion implies @xmath19 .",
    "our main result for the xxz chain , based on numerical tdmrg simulations , is that energy propagates ballistically at sufficiently long times , independently of model parameters ( such as @xmath7 ) .",
    "one can then interpret the prefactor @xmath20 in @xmath21 as a measure of the average velocity of excitations contributing to the expansion .",
    "the velocity @xmath20 can be calculated analytically and exactly in non - interacting models , which ( in the absence of impurities or disorder ) typically have ballistic dynamics , and we consider two examples : ( i ) the noninteracting limit of the xxz - hamiltonian ( @xmath22 ) , i.e. , spinless fermions and ( ii ) the luttinger liquid , which is the universal low - energy theory in the continuum limit of eq .   for @xmath23 . we show that our tdmrg results agree with the exactly known expansion velocity @xmath20 in these two examples .",
    "our main result , namely the numerical observation of @xmath24 independently of initial conditions or model parameters such as the exchange anisotropy @xmath7 , is consistent with the qualitative picture derived from linear - response theory . within that theory transport properties of the xxz chain",
    "have intensely been studied in recent years , both the energy@xcite and the spin transport .",
    "@xcite ballistic dynamics is associated with the existence of non - zero drude weights .",
    "since the total energy current of the anisotropic spin-1/2 chain is a conserved quantity for all @xmath7 , the thermal conductivity @xmath25 diverges in the zero - frequency limit and is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the thermal drude weight.@xcite this behavior is different from the spin conductivity @xmath28 .",
    "this quantity takes the form @xmath29 only at the noninteracting point @xmath22 , whereas for @xmath30 , many numerical studies@xcite indicate @xmath31 , with a _ finite weight at finite frequencies _ , though . therefore , for @xmath30 , @xmath32 .",
    "recent field - theoretical and numerical work suggests that the regular part @xmath33 of @xmath34 in massless phases is consistent with diffusive behavior.@xcite a finite value of the current - current correlation function in the long time limit is associated with a finite drude weight .",
    "finite drude weights can be traced back to the existence of conservation laws,@xcite and in consequence , a potential relation between integrability@xcite and ballistic behavior - in the sense of non - zero drude weights - has been intensely discussed ( see , e.g. , refs .   and further references cited therein ) .",
    "very recently , prosen has presented results that provide a lower bound to the spin drude weight that is non - zero for @xmath35.@xcite this is in qualitative agreement with earlier exact diagonalization studies.@xcite the particular point @xmath36 is still discussed controversially:@xcite first , no finite lower bound to the drude weight is known,@xcite and second , the qualitative results of exact diagonalization studies seem to depend on details of the extrapolation of finite - size data to the thermodynamic limit and the statistical ensemble that is considered.@xcite    our approach that analyzes the time - dependence of spatial variances , albeit restricted to the analysis of densities , is numerically easily tractable and is an alternative to the numerically cumbersome evaluation of current correlation functions .",
    "tdmrg has , for instance , been applied to evaluate current - current autocorrelation functions in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite however , the accessible time scales are quite limited @xmath37 ) , making an unambiguous interpretation of the results difficult and the approach is not applicable to non equilibrium .",
    "our approach allows us , at least in principle , to study the entire regime of weakly perturbed states to maximally excited ones .",
    "an earlier analysis of spin - density wave packets in various spin models has yielded the following picture ( all based on the time - dependence of the spatial variance):@xcite in massless phases , ballistic dynamics is seen , whereas in massive ones , examples of diffusive dynamics have been identified .",
    "it is important to stress that the observation of a variance that increases linear in time is a _ necessary _ condition for the validity of the diffusion equation .    finally , to complete the survey of related literature ,",
    "recent studies have addressed steady - state spin and energy transport in open systems coupled to baths , with no restriction to the linear - response regime.@xcite these studies suggest spin transport to be ballistic in the gapless phase of the xxz spin chain and to be diffusive in the gapped phase with a negative differential conductance at large driving strengths .",
    "the heat current has been addressed in ref .   where fourier s law has been validated for the ising model in a tilted field .",
    "a by - product of any tdmrg simulation is information on the time - evolution of the entanglement entropy .",
    "while this is not directly related to this article s chief case , it nevertheless provides valuable information on the numerical costs of tdmrg simulations .",
    "qualitatively , speaking ( see the discussion in ref . and references therein ) ,",
    "the faster the entanglement growth is , the shorter are the time scales that can be reached with tdmrg .",
    "we here show that the quenches studied in this work generate a mild logarithmic increase of entanglement , which is why this problem is very well suited for tdmrg .",
    "such a behavior is typical for so - called local quenches.@xcite this result might be useful for tdmrg practitioners .",

    "in this work , we focus on spin-@xmath0 xxz chains of a finite length @xmath9 given by eq .   where our goal is to study the dynamics of an inhomogeneous distribution of the local energy density originating from a local quench of system parameters .",
    "the inhomogeneous distributions are generated by preparing the system in the respective ground states of the following hamiltonians that are perturbations of @xmath38 from eq .  .",
    "first , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined in eq .  , and second , @xmath41 where @xmath42 in the first case , we quench site - dependent exchange couplings . in this scenario",

    "this allows us to generate smooth spatial perturbations of @xmath47 with small differences in energy compared to the ground state of eq .  .",
    "we refer to this setup as the @xmath48 quench .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the initial states generated by a @xmath46 quench will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec:4a ] .",
    "the @xmath48 quench was introduced in detail in ref .  .    the definition of the local energy density from the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : xxz ] ) is not unambiguous .",
    "for instance , it is always possible to add local terms to the hamiltonian whose total contribution by summation over all lattice sites vanishes .",
    "however , this seeming ambiguity can be resolved up to constants by requiring that any block of adjacent lattice sites @xmath49 is hermitian and yet to have the same structure as the total hamiltonian @xmath50 .",
    "these details seem to be rather specific , yet for the definition of the appropriate local energy density within the luttinger liquid description , see below , these formal considerations are important . for the xxz chain the local energy density",
    "is therefore determined by the bond energies @xmath47 .    to classify the dynamics of a density @xmath51 we study its spatial variance .",

    ": @xmath62    on physical grounds , the energy density should be normalized by the amount of energy transported by the propagating perturbation .",
    "this is well approximated by the energy difference @xmath63 between the initial state and the ground state of eq .",
    ", as we have verified in many examples . in some cases ,",
    "though , the propagating energy is , on a quantitatively level , better described by estimating the area under the perturbations , as @xmath63 may also contain contributions from static deviations from the ground state bond - energies in the background . nevertheless , @xmath63 does not depend on the overall zero of energy and is an obvious measure of how far the system is driven away from the ground state .",

    ", we subtract @xmath65 and study @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is expected to grow quadratically in time in the case of ballistic behavior , where @xmath20 has the dimensions of a velocity . for diffusive behavior , we expect , from the fundamental solution of the diffusion equation,@xcite that @xmath68 grows linearly in time , where @xmath69 is the diffusion constant ( see , e.g , the discussion in ref .  ) . within linear response theory",
    "the diffusion constant can be related to transport coefficients via einstein relations , see e.g. ref . .",
    "to be clear the observation of @xmath70 or @xmath71 is a _ necessary _ conditions for the respective type of dynamics and time - dependent crossovers are possible .      for pedagogical reasons and to guide the ensuing discussion we next calculate the spatial variance in the non - interacting limit of eq .",

    "characteristic for ballistic dynamics , @xmath84 is fully determined by the initial conditions through @xmath90 .    for completeness , we mention that an analogous calculation can be done for the spatial variance @xmath92 of the spin density .",

    "another aspect worth noting is that the time - evolving state carries a nonzero energy current , a situation that usually does not appear in the case of a global quench . from the equation of continuity for",

    "to connect the local energy currents to the spatial variance of the time - dependent density one can rewrite the time derivative of @xmath17 using the equation of continuity , assuming no current flow to sites at the boundary ( this assumption is justified in our examples as long as we restrict ourselves to times before reflections occur at the boundary in our simulations ) : @xmath106 if @xmath107 and @xmath108 , then using @xmath109 leads to : @xmath110 if we interpret this equation as an operator equation , then we see that we can define a quantity @xmath111 via : @xmath112 if for a given initial state and over a certain time window , @xmath113  const , then we have identified a regime with ballistic dynamics , @xmath114 . if @xmath113const holds for all times and initial states , then @xmath115 is a conserved quantity , @xmath116 .",
    "this is the case at @xmath22 , the non - interacting limit of eq .  , where @xmath117 from eq .  .",
    "we emphasize that we have here identified a operator that connects the phenomenological observation of a quadratic increase of @xmath118 to the local energy currents . in ballistic regimes ,",
    "its expectation value becomes stationary .    for completeness , we mention an analogous result in the diffusive regime where @xmath119",
    ". then , expectation values of the operator @xmath120 are time independent .",
    "obviously , similar expressions can be written down for the spatial variance associated with the spin density .",
    "in the gapless phase , i.e. , for @xmath121 , the low - energy and low - momentum properties of the xxz chain can be described by an effective luttinger liquid theory .",
    "@xcite in the following we want to analyze the energy density and the spin dynamics of the xxz chain in this exactly solvable hydrodynamic limit .",
    "specifically , we show that at least asymptotically for large times , the spatial variance always grows quadratically both in the case of spin and energy dynamics .",
    "in addition , we work out the precise dependence of the prefactor in front of the @xmath122 increase of the spatial variance on system parameters . since our dmrg results to be presented in secs .  [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ]",
    "show that @xmath24 at any @xmath7 , we did not investigate the influence of marginally relevant perturbations at @xmath36 on the wave - packet dynamics . in passing ,",
    "we mention that in the massive phase , where the appropriate low - energy theory is the sine - gordon model , the expansion velocity could also be derived at the luther - emery point ( this case was studied , in , e.g. refs .  ) .",

    "thus , within the validity of a luttinger liquid description the energy transport is always ballistic for all initial conditions .",
