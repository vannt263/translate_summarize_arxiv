    "the idea of cohesiveness as a measure of news importance is simple : if many sources report about same events then this should reflect their importance and correlate with the main trends in financial markets .",
    "however , in order to capture the trends of systemic importance one must be able to track different topics over majority of relevant online news sources .",
    "in other words , one needs : ( i ) an access to the relevant news sources and ( ii ) a comprehensive vocabulary of terms relevant for the domain of interest .",
    "we satisfy the second prerequisite for systemic approach through the use of large vocabulary of financial terms corresponding to companies , financial institutions , financial instruments and financial glossary terms . to satisfy the first prerequisite , in our analysis we rely on financial news documents extracted by a novel text - stream processing pipeline newstream  @xcite ( ` http://newstream.ijs.si/ ` ) , from a large number of web sources .",
    "these texts are then filtered and transformed into a form convenient for computing nci for the particular period of time .",
    "we show that importance of financial news can be measured in a more systemic way than via sentiment towards individual entities or number of occurrences of individual terms , and that strong cohesiveness in news reflects the trends in financial markets .",
    "there is already a strong evidence linking co - movement of financial instruments to systemic risk in financial markets  @xcite .",
    "we hypothesize that cohesiveness of financial news reflects in some part this systemic risk .",
    "our news cohesiveness index ( nci ) captures average mutual similarity between the documents and entities in the financial corpus .",
    "if we represent documents as sets of entitites then there are two alternative views on similarity : ( i ) two documents are more similar than some other two documents if they share more entities and ( ii ) two entities are more similar than some other two entities if they co - occur in more documents .",
    "we construct nci so that the overall similarity in a corpus of documents is equal regardless on the view we choose to adopt .",
    "we analyse the nci in the context of different financial indices , their volatility , trading volumes , as well as google search query volumes .",
    "we show that nci is highly correlated with volatility of main us and eu stock market indices , in particular their historical volatility and vix ( implied volatility of s&p500 ) .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that there is a substantial difference between aggregate term occurrence and cohesiveness in their relations toward financial indices .",
    "in order to measure the herding effects in financial news we introduce a news cohesiveness index ( nci ) - a systemic indicator that quantifies cohesion in a collection of financial documents . a starting point for the calculation of nci is a _ document - entity matrix _ that quantifies occurrences of entities in each individual document collected over certain period of time .",
    "we use concept of entity ( instead of e.g. term ) to represent different lexical appearances of some concept in texts . in our case",
    "we use a vocabulary of entities that includes financial glossary terms , financial institutions , companies and financial instruments .",
    "the full taxonomy of entities is available in supplementary information section 3 .",
    "we start with the definition of occurrence , which says whether some entity is present or not in some document , regardless of how many times it occurs in the document .",
    "this makes document - entity matrix @xmath0 a binary matrix :    @xmath1    @xmath0 is an @xmath2 matrix , where @xmath3 is the number of documents published in selected time period and @xmath4 is the total number of entities we monitor .",
    "document - entity matrix @xmath0 also corresponds to a biadjacency matrix of a bipartite graph between documents and entities .",
    "an edge between document @xmath5 and entity @xmath6 exists if the entity @xmath6 appears in the document @xmath5 .",
    "the overall similarity in the collection of documents should be equal regardless whether we choose to view it as the similarity between the _ documents _ or between the _",
    "entities_. to achieve this we define the similarity as the _ scalar product _ of either document pairs @xmath7 or entity pairs @xmath8 .",
    "now we define nci as a frobenius norm of scalar similarity matrix between all pairs of documents @xmath9 or entities @xmath10 :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "frobenius norms of both document - document similarity matrix @xmath15 and entity - entity similarity matrix @xmath16 are equal , therefore the cohesion is conserved whether we measure it as the _ document _ or the _ entity _ similarity :    @xmath17    in the network representation these two similarity matrices correspond to two projections of a bipartite graph of the original document - entity matrix , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : projection - matrix - network - representation ] .",
    "moreover , one can exploit properties of the frobenius norm of scalar similarity matrix and express cohesiveness as a function of singular values of document - entity matrix @xmath0 ( proof in the supplementary information section 2 ) :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are the @xmath20 largest singular values of matrix @xmath0 in a singular value decomposition : @xmath21 because singular values are calculated on the original document - entity matrix and not its document or entity projections , we claim that we capture an _ intrinsic _ property of the corresponding document - entity matrix that is invariant to projection .",
    "this can also be inferred from the fact that the eigenvalues of similarity matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 are equal and they correspond to the singular values of document - entity matrix @xmath0 .",
    "this approach can be beneficial for large document - entity matrices as it is much more efficient in terms of time and memory compared to explicit calculation of similarity matrix .",
    "we can calculate just first @xmath20 values incrementally , until we reach the desired accuracy of nci ( see supplementary information section 1 ) . in practice ,",
    "only a small number of singular values is enough to calculate nci up to the desired precision .",
    "as the number of documents is changing each day while the number of entities stays constant , all nci indices in our analyses are normalized with the number documents @xmath24 in the corpus .",
    "we have statistically confirmed that the nci is largely above the level of fluctuations of cohesiveness random null model ( see supplementary information section 2 ) .",
    "sometimes it is interesting to perform detailed analysis of which groups of entities or documents contribute the most to the overall cohesiveness . for this purpose we can divide entities or documents into groups using any appropriate semantic criteria and calculate cohesiveness for each group separately or between pairs of groups .",
    "semantic partitions in the entity projection are created via grouping of entities in mutually disjoint groups , defined by their taxonomy labels ( hence semantic interpretation ) . on the other hand ,",
    "semantic partitions in the document projection can be created via grouping of entities either by their temporal or source membership .",
    "figure  [ fig : semantic - partitioning ] illustrates the concept of partitioning in the context of different projections .",
    "we can calculate cohesiveness separately for each semantic group or a combination of semantic groups .",
    "note that even in this case we do not need to explicitly calculate similarity matrices ( see supplementary information section 1 ) .",
    "following the taxonomy of entities described in supplementary information section 3 we defined four semantic groups : companies , regions , financial instrument and euro crisis terms .",
    "figure  [ fig : semantic_components_occurrences ] shows the most frequent entities in each of the semantic partitions , based on the news corpus collected over the period of analysis .          in order to asses",
    "nci s utility as a systemic risk indicator , we use correlations analysis and granger causality tests against the pool of financial market and information indicators .",
    "the analysis should also provide deeper insight into the interplay between news , trends in financial markets and behaviour of investors .",
    "we adopt terminology from  @xcite , and treat our news based indicators ( nci variants and entity occurence ) as indicators of the information supply in online media , while volumes of google search queries will be treated as indicators of information demand or as a proxy of investor interest .",
    "we group indicators as follows :    * * inormation supply indicators : * - cohesiveness index based on all the news ( nci ) from newstream , cohesiveness index based only on filtered financial news ( nci - financial ) from newstream , total entity occurrences based on the aggregate from all news documents , and total entity occurrences based on strictly financial documents of newstream . * * information demand indicators : * - these are volumes of google search queries ( gsq ) for 4 finance / economy related categories from google finance ( from google domestic trends - finance&investment , bankruptcy , financial planning , business ) . * * financial market indicators : * - these include daily realized volatilities , historical volatilities and trading volumes of major stock market indices ( s&p 500 , dax , ftse , nikkei 225 , hang seng ) as well as implied volatilities of s&p500 ( vix ) .",
    "details on preparation of individual indicators are given in methods section .",
    "we start the analysis with a simple comparison of nci calculated on all news and nci calculated on filtered financial news .",
    "figure  [ fig : nci_vs_indices ] shows dynamics of nci , and nci - financial in comparison to vix ( implied volatility of s&p 500 , the so called `` fear factor ''  @xcite ) .",
    "scatter plots on the right show that correlation of vix and nci - financial is significantly higher than vix and nci .",
    "this is a first illustration of the importance of the filtering the right content for the construction of indicators from texts . for more details on how filtering affects correlations with other indices",
    "see supplementary information section 3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : corr_matrix ] shows pearson correlation coefficients between different information indicators and financial market indicators .",
    "corresponding p - values are calculated using a permutation test and are available in supplementary information section 5 .",
    "all correlations reported in this article have p - value @xmath25 unless explicitly stated .",
    "interesingly , the correlations between total entity occurrences , nci and nci - financial are relatively low , confirming that cohesiveness captures very different signal from the entity occurrences .",
    "furthermore , correlations between total entity occurrences , nci and financial indices are , on average , much lower than correlations between nci - financial and financial indices .",
    "relatively low correlation between nci - financial and nci confirms importance of filtering out strictly financial market - related articles from the newstream , rather than having all the articles that contain some of the entities from the vocabulary .",
    "we have performed a more detailed analysis of these effects by studying in parallel behavior of different variants of entity occurrences and nci - financial using different subsets of the vocabulary and the document space , independently .",
    "the main insight gained was that entity occurences become more informative when a smaller vocabulary of the most frequent entities is used , but this requires use of the whole document space .",
    "nci has proven to be much more robust to the choice of both vocabulary and document space ( details in supplementary information section 6 ) .",
    "interestingly , the nci - financial index is highly correlated with implied volatility ( @xmath26 , figure  [ fig : corr_matrix ] ) , as well as with historical and daily realized volatilities ( @xmath27 , figure  [ fig : corr_matrix ] ) .",
    "these correlations are much higher than the correlations of the gsq categories ( @xmath28 , figure  [ fig : corr_matrix ] ) .",
    "in contrast to nci - financial , gsq categories exhibit relatively stronger correlations with stock trading volumes ( @xmath29 , figure  [ fig : corr_matrix ] ) .",
    "google bankruptcy and google unemployment are significantly correlated with nci - financial ( correlation above 0.2 , figure  [ fig : corr_matrix ] ) , which is most probably due to similarities in vocabulary used in constructing nci - financial and respective gsq indicators .",
    "a more in depth picture of the news cohesiveness index is obtained when observing individual semantic components of nci - financial and their correlation patterns with financial and google search query indicators .",
    "semantic components based on ` [ region ] ` and ` [ eurocrisis ] ` taxonomy categories all have similar correlation patterns to nci - financial ( with correlation above 0.7 for ` [ eurocrisis ] ` and above 0.5 for ` [ region ] ` , figure  [ fig : corr_matrix ] ) ; this also shows that these categories are most important for the behavior of nci - financial . on the other hand , semantic components based on ` [ company ] ` and ` [ instrument ] ` exhibit quite different , in many parts , opposite correlation patterns ( with correlations close to 0 or even negative ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that both the nci - financial and gsq indicators have strong negative correlation with nikkei 225 volatility and trading volume ( up to -0.4 for nci - financial and up to -0.5 for gsq - unemployment ) .",
    "the granger - causality test ( gc test ) is frequently used to determine whether a time series @xmath30 is useful in forecasting another time series @xmath31 .",
    "the idea of the gc test is to evaluate if @xmath31 can be better predicted using both the histories of @xmath31 and @xmath30 rather than using only the history of @xmath31 ( i.e. @xmath30 granger - causes @xmath31 ) .",
    "the test is performed by regressing @xmath31 on its own time - lagged values and on those of @xmath30 included .",
    "an f - test is used in examining if the null hypothesis that @xmath31 is not granger - caused by @xmath30 can be rejected .    in table",
    "[ fig : table_gc_bidirect ] we show results of pairwise g - causality tests between information supply and demand indicators and financial indicators .",
    "cells of the table give both directionality ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 or bidirectional @xmath34 ) and significance at two levels of f - test ( p - values @xmath35 ;",
    "@xmath36 ) . besides gc testing nci - financial and its semantic components at higher taxonomy levels ,",
    "we show also results obtained for nci ( non - filtered news nci ) and total entity occurences as a baseline .    the results in table  [ fig : table_gc_bidirect ] paint a much different picture than the correlation study .",
    "firstly , granger causality seems to be almost exclusively directed from financial to information world , with single bidirectional exception between ` [ region]x[eurocrisis ] ` semantic component of nci - financial and hang seng daily realized volatility .",
    "our financial news indicator nci - financial seems to be g - caused solely by ftse daily volatility .",
    "this finding is in contrast with the fact that the nci - financial is strongly correlated with several other indicators like implied volatility ( vix ) ( @xmath26 , table  [ fig : corr_matrix ] ) .",
    "however , two of the semantic components ` [ eurocrisis]x[eurocrisis ] ` and ` [ region]x[eurocrisis ] ` are strongly g - caused by implied volatility , historical and daily volatilities of most of the major stock market indices .",
    "on the other hand , the gsq categories seem to be mostly gc driven by trading volumes , almost exclusively of us and uk financial market ( s&p 500 and ftse ) .",
    "gsq indicators seem to be divided in two groups by their g - causality : ( i ) those that are g - caused mainly by trading volumes ( business and industrial , bankruptcy , financial planning and finance and investment ) and total entity occurrences in the news , and ( ii ) those that are strongly g - caused by all other gsq categories ( unemployment ) .",
    "interestingly , total entity occurrence in the news , seem to be the strongest g - causality driver of the gsq volumes , while two of the semantic components of nci - financial are g - caused by gsq finance and investment and financial planning .",
    "this work introduces a new indicator of financial news importance based on a concept of cohesiveness of texts , from large corpora of news and blogs sources .",
    "in contrast to indicators introduced by other authors which are based on sentiment modelling , nci measures cohesiveness in the news by approximating the average similarity between texts .",
    "our correlation results confirm the main hypothesis that cohesiveness of the financial news is a signal that is strongly correlated with systemic financial market indicators in particular volatilities of major stock exchanges .",
    "the analysis of granger causality tests over a pool of financial and information related indicators suggests that nci - financial is mainly related with the volatility of the market . in our analysis",
    "most important semantic components of nci - financial are mainly g - caused by implied ( vix ) , historical and daily volatilities .",
    "this implies effects from both short term and long term risks in the financial market .",
    "the only exception ( bidirectional causality between _ [ region]x[eurocrisis ] _ and hang seng daily volatility ) might be plausibly explained as a time zone effect .",
    "this does not seem to be the case for gsq indicators which are mainly driven by trading volumes , with the exception of gsq unemployment , which seems to be driven mostly by search volumes of other gsq categories .",
    "similar to findings of some previous studies  @xcite , in which aggregate sentiment or financial headline occurrence were used as measures of state of the financial market , information supply co - movement as measured by nci - financial , seem to be primarily caused by trends on the financial market rather than the opposite .",
    "we find that similar results holds also for the gsq categories which approximate information demand side in our case .",
    "g - causality patterns show , similarly to correlation , that cohesiveness captures quite different signal with respect to total entity occurrence ; the results also suggest the presence of somewhat circular interplay between information supply and information demand indicators .",
    "for example , total entity occurrence is g - causing three of the gsq categories ( business and industry , bankruptcy and financial planning ) , while financial planning and unemployment are g - causal for semantic components ` [ instrument]x[eurocrisis ] ` and ` [ eurocrisis]x[eurocrisis ] ` , which suggests feedback mechanisms between news and search behaviour .    in comparison with the findings of studies which used simpler measures of news importance or sentiment",
    ", we find that financial news cohesiveness reflects the level of the volatility in the market and is gc driven both by current level of volatility and implied volatility , while gsq volumes are driven mainly by trading volumes .",
    "impact of news cohesiveness and gsq volumes in the reverse direction , as determined by gc tests , is only weakly implied in case of semantic components of nci - financial and hang seng index .",
    "this is not in line with previous works that report predictive utility ( mostly for gsq volumes ) with respect to certain financial instruments .",
    "however , one has to bear in mind that the results of gc tests reflect average of lagged correlations between indicators over the specific period in time ( in our case oct 2011 - jul 2013 ) .",
    "it is possible that direction of causality between information and financial indicators changes in time , but this was hard to detect in our data due to the limited length of time series .",
    "another possible reason for different results is that most of previous works were based on a limited number of google search query terms , typicaly more closely related to the particular stock market index of interest . in principle , this is different from volumes of gsq term categories in our case , which reflect aggregates over larger number of different query terms .",
    "gsq categories closely resemble the concept of semantic components and it is possible that the application of the concept of cohesiveness , if adapted to gsq category volumes , may produce signals more predictive with respect to financial market trends .",
    "access to structured information about the financial markets with its various instruments and indicators is available for several decades , but systematic quantification of unstructured information hidden in news from diverse web sources is of relatively recent origin .",
    "we base our analyses on a newly created text processing pipeline - newstream  @xcite , designed and implemented within the scope of eu fp7 projects first ( ` http://project-first.eu/ ` ) and foc ( ` http://www.focproject.eu/ ` ) .",
    "newstream continuously downloads articles from more than 200 worldwide news sources , extracts the content and stores complete texts of articles .",
    "it is a domain independent data acquisition pipeline , but biased towards finance by the selection of news sources and the taxonomy of entities relevant for finance .    for the purpose of filtering , efficient",
    "storing and analytics , expert based financial taxonomy and vocabulary of entities and terms have been created , containing names of relevant financial institutions , companies , finance and economics specific terms , etc .",
    "the newstream pipeline has been collecting data since october 2011 . in our analyses",
    "we use text corpora from october 2011 to june 2013 and we have filtered over 1,400,000 financially related texts stored in the form of document - entity matrices .",
    "full structure of the taxonomy is in the supplementary information section 3 , and the list of the domains from which most documents were downloaded in the supplementary information section 4 .    [",

    "moreover , despite the selection of financial news sites , there are many articles which are only indirectly related to finance , such as politics or even sport . to obtain a clean collection of strictly financial texts , we have developed a rule - based model utilizing taxonomy categories as features to describe documents , and a gold standard of human labelled documents ( @xmath37 3500 documents ) . a machine learned rule - based model is used as a filter for extracting strictly finance related texts from a corpus .",
    "this model has a recall of over 50% , with precision of well over 80% .",
