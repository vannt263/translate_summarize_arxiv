    "one of the outstanding open problems of theoretical physics is to reconcile the very small observational bound on the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , with the very large values that standard high energy physics theory predicts for it @xcite .",
    "this challenge has led to consider the cosmological constant as a dynamical variable , whose evolution is governed by equations of motion . in that context",
    "one has looked for mechanisms that would enable @xmath0 to relax from a large initial value to a small one during the course of the evolution of the universe .",
    "the simplest context in which this idea may be analyzed , is through the introduction of an antisymmetric gauge potential , a three ",
    "form @xcite in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "the three  form couples to the gravitational field with a term proportional to the square of the field strength . in the absence of sources ,",
    "the field strength is constant in space and time and provides a contribution to the cosmological term , which then becomes a constant of the motion rather than a universal constant .",
    "changes in the cosmological constant occur when one brings in sources for the three  form potential .",
    "these sources are two  dimensional membranes which sweep a three dimensional history during their evolution (  domain walls \" ) .",
    "the membranes carry charge associated with the gauge invariance of the three  form field , and they divide spacetime into two regions with different values of the cosmological term .    the membranes may be produced spontaneously in two physically different ways .",
    "one way is by tunneling trough a potential barrier as it happens in pair production in two  dimensional spacetime .",
    "the other , is by a thermal excitation of the vacuum analogous to going  over the top \" of the potential barrier rather than tunneling through it .",
    "the tunneling process was originally studied in @xcite , and was further explored in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study the spontaneous decay of the cosmological constant through the other process , namely , the production of membranes due to the thermal effects of the cosmological horizon .",
    "it is useful to visualize the decay process in terms of its simplest context , which is a particle in a one dimensional potential barrier , as recalled in fig .",
    "[ potential ] .",
    "when the barrier is in a thermal environment , the particle can go from one side of the barrier to the other by  climbing over the top \" rather than tunneling .",
    "there is a probability given by the boltzmann factor @xmath1 for the particle to be in a state of energy @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath2 is greater than the height of the barrier the particle will move from one side to the other even classically .",
    "the effect is optimized when the energy is just enough for the particle to be at the top of the barrier and roll down to the other side . in this case",
    ", the boltzmann factor is as large as possible while still allowing for the process without quantum mechanical tunneling .",
    "it turns out that , in the leading approximation , the probability is given by the exponential of the euclidean action evaluated on an appropriate classical solution , just as for tunneling @xcite . in the case of tunneling",
    ", the classical solution is called an instanton and it is time dependent @xcite . in the present case , the classical solution corresponds to the configuration in which the particle sits at the top of the barrier , and thus it is time independent .",
    "since the solution is unstable , when slightly perturbed the particle will fall half of the time to the left side and half of the time to the right side .",
    "it may end up in the other side of the barrier , reaching the lower minimum @xmath3 by two different mechanisms .",
    "it can either ( i ) tunnel through the potential quantum mechanically or ( ii ) it can jump over it by a thermal fluctuation when the barrier is in a thermal environment.,width=377 ]    in more complex situations ,  sitting at the top of the barrier \" is replaced by a  time independent classical solution with one instability mode\"@xcite . in the context of gauge theories",
    "such solutions appear in the analysis of violation of baryon  number conservation and have been called  sphalerons\"@xcite . in the present case",
    "we will use the name  thermalon \" , to emphasize that the static solutions will be intimately connected with the intrinsic thermal properties of event horizons in gravitational theory .",
    "we show below that there exists a thermalon which reduces the cosmological constant through production of membranes in de sitter space due to the thermal properties of the cosmological horizon . in this thermalon",
    ", a membrane is emitted by the cosmological horizon and collapses forming a black hole .",
    "once produced , the membrane divides space into two regions with the interior having a lower value of @xmath0 .",
    "subsequently , the membrane evolves with the region of lower @xmath0 filling more and more of the space , thus lowering the value of the cosmological constant .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we gave the equations of motions of a charged membrane of tension @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 coupled to the gravitational field , and employed them to analyze instantons associated with tunneling .",
    "the same equations will be used here for the study of thermalons .",
    "we reproduce them verbatim here , together with the corresponding explanations , to make the discussion self  contained .",
    "we consider an euclidean spacetime element of the form @xmath6 the antisymmetric field strength tensor takes the form @xmath7 the history of the membrane will divide the spacetime in two regions , one which will be called the interior , labeled by the suffix `` - '' and the other the exterior , labeled by the suffix `` + '' .",
    "the exterior is the initial region and defines the  background \" , while the interior is the final region .",
    "the boundary may be described by the parametric equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the proper length in the @xmath10 sector , so that its line element reads @xmath11 with @xmath12    in the `` + '' and `` - '' regions the solution of the field equations read @xmath13 the actual cosmological constant @xmath14 is thus obtained by adding @xmath15 , normally taken to be negative , coming from  the rest of physics \" and not subject to change , and the contribution @xmath16 , which is subject to dynamical equations .",
    "the discontinuities in the functions @xmath17 and @xmath2 across the membrane are given by @xmath18    here @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the tension and charge on the membrane respectively .",
    "( [ deltae ] ) follows from integrating the gauss law for the antisymmetric tensor across the membrane , whereas eq .",
    "( [ deltaf ] ) represents the discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature of the membrane when it is regarded as embedded in either the  - \" or the  + \" spaces @xcite . in writing these equations ,",
    "the following orientation conventions have been adopted , and will be maintained from here on : @xmath19 the coordinate @xmath20 increases anticlockwise around the cosmological horizon , @xmath21 the variable @xmath9 increases when the curve is traveled along leaving the interior on its right side",
    ".    equation ( [ deltaf ] ) may be thought of as the first integral of the equation of motion for the membrane , which is thus obtained by differentiating it with respect to @xmath9 ( `` equations of motion from field equations '' ) .",
    "hence , satisfying ( [ ds]-[deltae ] ) amounts to solving all the equations of motion and , therefore , finding an extremum of the action .",
    "more explicitly , the first integral of the equation of motion for the membrane may be written as , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass difference between the initial and final geometries and , @xmath24    the euclidean evolution of the membrane lies between two turning points .",
    "once the initial mass @xmath25 and the initial cosmological constant @xmath26 are given , the turning points , @xmath27 , are determined through , @xmath28 by setting @xmath29 in ( [ masst ] ) . here",
    "we have defined @xmath30 .",
    "the graph of the function ( [ mass ] ) for fixed @xmath25 , shown in fig .",
    "[ masspic ] , will be referred to as the  mass diagram \" for the decay of schwarzschild  de sitter space .",
    "there are two branches which merge smoothly , corresponding to taking both signs in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) , much as @xmath31 gives the smooth circle @xmath32 .",
    "the lower and upper branches merge at the intersections with the curve @xmath33 which determines the sign of @xmath34 , which is positive below the curve and negative above it .",
    "this curve , the  @xmath35 curve \" , plays an important role because it determines which side of the @xmath36 geometry must be retained : according to the conventions established above , if @xmath34 is positive , one must retain the side of the membrane history with ( locally ) greater values of the radial coordinate ; if @xmath34 is negative , one must keep the other side .",
    "the curve @xmath37 is also shown on the mass diagram , as is the curve @xmath38 , which , as can be seen from ( [ masst ] ) , has for equation @xmath39 .",
    "a similar rule applies for determining which side of the minus geometry is retained : it is the side of increasing @xmath40 if @xmath41 is negative and the other side if it is positive .     where @xmath29 for a given mass gap @xmath42 .",
    "the thermalons are located at the maximum ( cosmological thermalon ) and minimum ( black hole thermalon ) of the curve .",
    "the curves where @xmath27 is such that for a given @xmath42 , @xmath43 are also shown .",
    "all the  + \" parameters are held fixed.,width=302 ]      there are four distinguished points in the mass diagram , two for which the tangent is vertical and two for which it is horizontal .",
    "the former , located at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , correspond to membrane creation through tunneling and they give rise to the instantons discussed in @xcite .",
    "the latter are thermalons .",
    "the thermalon at the top of the diagram will be called  cosmological thermalon \" because it is associated with the cosmological event horizon .",
    "the thermalon at the bottom of the mass diagram will be called  black hole thermalon \" .",
    "it needs an initial black hole to provide the thermal environment .",
    "for the particular values of @xmath42 corresponding to the thermalons , the two turning points coalesce and the membrane trajectory is a circle .",
    "the geometry of the thermalons is depicted in fig .",
    "[ euclid ] .    for the cosmological thermalon , the sign of @xmath46 may be either positive or negative , depending on the values of the parameters .",
    "if @xmath46 is negative , one must glue the region of the minus geometry that contains the cosmological horizon @xmath47 to the original background geometry .",
    "the thermalon has then one black hole horizon ( @xmath44 ) and one cosmological horizon ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath46 is positive , one must glue the other side of the membrane history to the original background geometry .",
    "this produces a solution with two black hole horizons , one at @xmath44 and one at @xmath48 .",
    "the inversion of the sign of @xmath46 happens when @xmath49 , that is , when the  - \" geometry becomes the nariai geometry . therefore we will call this particular case the  nariai threshold \" and will discuss it in section iv below . note that @xmath34 is always negative ,",
    "hence it is always the @xmath44-side of the plus geometry that must be kept .    for the black hole thermalon @xmath46",
    "is always positive .",
    "this is because @xmath46 is greater than @xmath34 , which is positive in this case .",
    "section is shown . in each figure , the radial coordinate increases if one moves upwards.,width=340 ]    for both thermalons , the minkowskian solution is unstable and the euclidean solution is stable . when slightly perturbed , the euclidean solution oscillates around the thermalon . for the minkowskian case , the membrane can evolve in two ways",
    ": it can start accelerating ( rolling down ) either towards the exterior or the interior .",
    "if the acceleration is directed toward the exterior , spacetime will become filled with the interior (  - \" ) geometry , and the cosmological term will decrease .",
    "if , on the other hand , it accelerates toward the interior , then , and as time increases , the exterior will become the whole geometry and the cosmological constant will return to its original value . in this case",
    "the process will not have changed anything .",
    "the minimum and the maximum of the mass curve are euclidean stable points , because both correspond to maxima of the potential on the sense of fig .",
    "1 . the cosmological  thermalon corresponds to a maximum of the potential ultimately because , as established in @xcite , the internal energy of the cosmological horizon is @xmath50 rather than @xmath51 .",
    "thus , in the analogy with the potential problem one should plot @xmath52 in the vertical axis , so that the potential in fig .",
    "2 is upside down and the analogy holds .",
    "the instability of both thermalons is proven explicitly in appendix [ apb ] .",
    "lastly , there is another important distinction between black hole and cosmological thermalons which resides in how they behave when gravity is decoupled , that is , when newton s constant @xmath53 is taken to vanish . in that case",
    "the black hole thermalon becomes the standard nucleation of a bubble of a stable phase within a metastable medium , whereas the cosmological thermalon no longer exists .",
    "the decoupling of gravity is discussed in appendix [ apc ] .",
    "the prescription for obtaining the lorentzian signature solution , which describes the decay process in actual spacetime , is to find a surface of time symmetry in the euclidean signature solution and evolve the cauchy data on that surface in lorentzian time .",
    "the fact that the surface chosen is one of time symmetry , ensures that the lorentzian signature solution will be real .",
    "another way of describing the same statement is to say that one matches the euclidean and lorentzian signature solutions on a surface of time symmetry .    for the cosmological thermalon that induces decay of de sitter space we will take the surface of time symmetry as",
    "the line in @xmath10 space which , described from the euclidean side , starts from @xmath54 , @xmath55 , proceeds increasing @xmath40 , keeping @xmath54 until it reaches the cosmological horizon , and then descends back to @xmath55 along the line @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the surface of time symmetry crosses the membrane formation radius , @xmath27 , twice , which implies that actually _ two _ membranes , of opposite polarities , are formed .",
    "the cosmological constant is decreased in the finite  volume region between them .",
    "the penrose diagram for the lorentzian section , below the nariai threshold , is given in fig .",

    "[ ctdiagram ] , @xmath47 by @xmath48 and @xmath59 by the black hole singularity @xmath55 of the  - \" geometry .",
    "we will be interested in the probability @xmath60 per unit of time and unit of spatial volume for the production of a thermalon . in the leading semiclassical approximation ,",
    "that probability is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the value of the euclidean action on the thermalon solution ( in our conventions , the sign of the euclidean action is such that , in the semiclassical limit , it corresponds to @xmath63 , the inverse temperature times the free energy ) .",
    "the prefactor @xmath64 is a slowly varying function with dimensions of a length to the negative fourth power build out of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath4 .",
    "the choice of the action depends on the boundary conditions used , and also involves  background subtractions \" , which ensure that when the coupling with the membrane is turned off ( @xmath67 ) , the probability ( [ pbb ] ) is equal to unity , since , in that case , @xmath68 becomes the probability for things to remain as they are when nothing is available to provoke a change .    to address the issue of boundary conditions we refer the readers to figures [ euclid ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "there we have drawn small circles around the exterior black hole and cosmological horizons respectively , to indicate that the corresponding point is treated as a boundary , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the point in question takes in each case the place of spatial infinity for a black hole in asymptotically flat space .",
    "it represents the  platform \" on which the  external observer \" sits . on the boundary",
    "there is no demand that the equations of motion should hold , and thus it is permissible for a conical singularity to appear there , as it indeed happens .",
    "once a boundary is chosen one sums in the path integral over all possible configurations elsewhere . as a consequence , no conical singularity is allowed anywhere else but at the boundary .",
    "therefore , the gravitational action should include a contribution equal to one fourth of the area of that horizon which is not at the boundary .    to be definite ,",
    "consider the cosmological thermalon . in that case",
    "the boundary is placed at @xmath44 , and therefore , one is including the thermodynamical effects of the cosmological horizon ( which is the reason for the term  cosmological thermalon \" ) .",
    "we then fix at the boundary the value of @xmath44 itself or , equivalently , the mass @xmath25 , in addition to fixing the cosmological constant @xmath69 .    with these boundary conditions the total action for the problem is just the standard",
    " bulk \" hamiltonian action of the coupled system formed by the gravitational field , the antisymmetric tensor field and the membrane , with one fourth of the corresponding horizon area added@xcite .",
    "this action includes the minimal coupling term of the three  form field to the membrane , by which the canonical momentum of the membrane differs from the purely kinetic (  mass times the velocity \" ) term , and whose evaluation needs a definition of the potential on the membrane .",
    "such a definition requires a mild form of regularization which is dictated by the problem itself , and which we pass to analyze now .",
    "the minimal coupling term is @xmath70 where the integral extends over the membrane history @xmath71 and @xmath64 is evaluated on @xmath71 .",
    "the potential @xmath64 is such that the magnitude @xmath2 of its exterior derivative jumps by @xmath5 when passing from the interior (  - \" region ) of @xmath71 to the exterior (  + \" region ) as stated in eq .",
    "( [ deltae ] ) .",
    "we will impose the following conditions on @xmath64 : ( @xmath72 ) @xmath64 must be regular at that origin ( horizon ) which is in the interior of @xmath71 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath73 should be equal to zero up to a regular gauge transformation , in order for the integral over a very small loop enclosing the horizon to vanish as the loop shrinks to a point .",
    "this is quite straightforward .",
    "the subtlety comes in with @xmath74 , the value of @xmath64 in the exterior of @xmath71 .",
    "the fields in the exterior should be those corresponding to the solution of the equations of motion that would hold everywhere if the transition where never to occur .",
    "therefore , we will demand that : ( @xmath75 ) the function @xmath74 will be the same , for the given value of @xmath76 , as when the membrane is absent .",
    "this means that @xmath74 should be regular at the horizon in the absence of the membrane , which implies  as one may show  that @xmath64 is discontinuous across the membrane . with the above definition of @xmath64 one may now rewrite the minimal coupling term ( [ minimal ] ) as an integral over the interior @xmath77 of the membrane , by means of stoke s formula .",
    "this gives , @xmath78 with @xmath66 given by ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "the appearance of the average field , @xmath79 , may be thought of as coming from defining the integral over @xmath77 as the average of the integrals obtained when the boundary of the @xmath77 is displaced infinitesimally towards the interior and exterior of the membrane worldsheet .",
    "this is equivalent to  thickening \" the membrane and taking the boundary half way inside .",
    "it is interesting to point out that , in the case of membrane production in flat space , the definition of the potential @xmath64 on the membrane through the  thickening \" employed in ( [ adef ] ) is equivalent to subtracting the background field action @xmath80 .",
    "thus , we will assume that when ( [ adef ] ) is used there remains only to subtract the gravitational background action , which is equal to one fourth of the horizon area in the absence of the membrane ( the background hamiltonian is zero ! ) .",
    "the difference in the horizon areas with and without membrane may be thought of the change in the available phase space of horizon states induced by the creation of the membrane .    to be able to write explicitly the form of @xmath81 , one further notices that , since on - shell the hamiltonian constraints hold , the bulk hamiltonian action reduces to the  @xmath82 \" term .",
    "furthermore , for both the gravitational and antisymmetric fields , which are time independent in the exterior and interior of the membrane , @xmath83 vanishes , and , therefore , only the membrane contribution which contains both the membrane kinetic term and the minimal coupling terms , remains .",
    "with all these observations taken into account , the action which appears in the probability of the cosmological thermalon becomes , @xmath84 - \\frac{\\mu}{4\\pi } v_3 + \\alpha^2\\frac{3}{8\\pi } v_4   \\ , \\label{probability}\\ ] ] below the nariai threshold , and @xmath85 -\\frac{\\mu}{4\\pi } v_3 + \\alpha^2\\frac{3}{8\\pi } v_4   \\ .",
    "\\label{probability2}\\ ] ] above it .    for the central case of interest in this paper , namely , the decay of de sitter space through the cosmological thermalon , we set the initial mass @xmath25 equal to zero",
    "note that the cosmological thermalon lies in the upper branch of the mass curve , while the tunneling decay investigated in @xcite lies on the lower branch .",
    "therefore , the thermalon process discussed here and the tunneling of @xcite are not to be thought of as happening in the same potential barrier in the sense of the analogy illustrated by fig .",
    "[ potential ] . yet , the two probabilities may be compared , and the comparison is of interest . since there is no black hole in the initial state , the initial geometry has the full @xmath86-symmetry and the nucleation process can occur anywhere in spacetime .",
    "hence , the computed probability is a probability per unit of spacetime volume .",
    "note that the thermalon solution breaks the symmetry down to @xmath87 , while the tunneling solution of @xcite breaks it to the larger symmetry group @xmath88 .",
    "hence it is expected to have higher probability @xcite , which is indeed confirmed by the analysis given below .",
    "after de sitter decays through the thermalon once , the process may happen again , and again .",
    "if the black hole formed after the decay is small , on may , to a first approximation , ignore its presence and use the same formula for the probability , taking the final cosmological radius @xmath89 of the previous step as the @xmath65 of the new step .",
    "it is quite alright to ignore the presence of the black hole when @xmath48 is small because the probability of the second black hole to be near the first one will be very small , since it is a probability per unit of volume .",
    "the approximation will break down when the nariai bound is in sight .",
    "for given membrane parameters @xmath90 , bare cosmological constant @xmath15 and initial mass @xmath25 , there is a value @xmath91 of @xmath65 for which the final geometry becomes the nariai solution . in that case ,",
    "@xmath92 , since there is nowhere else for @xmath27 to be , and thus the curve @xmath93 , which always crosses the mass curve at a root of @xmath94 , does it now precisely at the cosmological thermalon nucleation radius @xmath27 .",
    "if one starts from a small @xmath65 one finds the situation illustrated in fig . 3a .",
    "as @xmath65 increases , the size of the black hole present in the  - \" region also increases , and at @xmath95 , the  - \" geometry becomes the nariai solution .",
    "if @xmath65 increases further , and we will refer to this further increase as  crossing the nariai threshold \" , @xmath46 becomes positive , which means that , as seen from the  - \" side , the orientation of the membrane is reversed .",
    "this implies that one must glue the part of the  - \" region which one was discarding below the nariai threshold to the  + \" region , thus giving rise to the situation described in fig . 3b .",
    "it should be emphasized that crossing the nariai threshold is not a violent operation .",
    "the bound @xmath96 for the existence of a de sitter black hole is maintained throughout ( @xmath97 is real since @xmath98 , which implies , using ( [ mass ] ) , that @xmath99 is also real and hence the function @xmath100 has two positive real roots ) .",
    "the action , and hence the probability , remains continuous .",
    "however , the nature of the thermalon geometry is now somewhat different , since the  - \" geometry has a black hole horizon instead of a cosmological horizon . as one moves from the boundary @xmath44 towards the membrane , ther radius @xmath40 of the attached @xmath101 increases .",
    "but , after crossing the membrane , it starts decreasing  in contradistinction to what happens below the threshold ,  until it reaches its minimun value at the black hole radius of the  - \" geometry .",

    "there are two interesting subcases which are amenable to analytical treatment :    @xmath142 first , we may assume that @xmath143 this limit may be achieved , for instance , by taking @xmath4 to be of the order of @xmath144 , that is , @xmath145 , again , up late stages of the evolution of @xmath65 .",
    "in this limit , @xmath146 direct computations yield @xmath147 the nucleation radius is roughly @xmath148 and the initial and final universe radii @xmath65 and @xmath89 are equal to leading order .",
    "since both @xmath149 and @xmath150 are small , eq . ( [ alpha1 ] ) implies @xmath151 so that the final geometry contains the cosmological horizon @xmath47 .",
    "we then get for the action @xmath152 , @xmath153 which can be compared to the tunneling ",
    "process action with the same parameters @xmath154 we conclude that in this regime the tunneling ",
    "process is more probable than the cosmological thermalon .",
    "@xmath155 conversely , we may assume , namely , @xmath156 which is equivalent to , @xmath157 this limit may be achieved , for instance , by setting @xmath158 (  bps condition \" ) for late stages of the evolution of the cosmological constant ( @xmath159 ( planck ) , @xmath160 ( susy ) ) .",
    "here we get for the nucleation radius and final mass , @xmath161 which shows that , in this limit , the nucleation radius gets close to the cosmological horizon .",
    "the value of the action for this process is , to leading order , @xmath162 which may be compared with the action for the tunneling process in the same limit , @xmath163 we again see in this regime that the tunneling  process is more probable than the cosmological thermalon .",
    "the cosmological thermalon has a distinct advantage over the instanton proposed in @xcite as a mechanism for relaxing the cosmological constant in that it does not have the so called  horizon problem \" .",
    "indeed , since for the thermalon the cosmological constant is reduced in the region with bigger values of the radial coordinate , and then the membrane proceeds to collapse , one is sure that , even though the universe is expanding ( and even more because it is so ! ) , the whole of the universe will relax its cosmological constant .",
    "the other problem that the instanton has is that the rate of membrane nucleation was too small to account for the present small value of the cosmological term .",
    "it is not clear at the moment of this writing whether the thermalon will also be an improvement in this regard . indeed , to make a mild assessment of whether the rate is sufficiently strong",
    ", we first recall that , in planck units , the observed value of the cosmological constant now is @xmath164 and the age of the universe @xmath165 . even though the process of relaxation of the cosmological constant may have not occurred through the entire life span of the post big - bang universe , we may use for very rough estimates @xmath165 as the time available for the process to keep occurring .",
    "if we assume that the cosmological radius started at the planck scale , @xmath166 and at present has the value @xmath165 , and recall that each bubble nucleation reduces @xmath167 by @xmath66 , one needs @xmath168 events to occur during @xmath165 planck time units .",
    "furthermore , since at any given time the volume of space available for the location of the center of the bubble is of the order of @xmath169 ( spatial volume in the comoving frame of de sitter space ) , we conclude that the rate @xmath60 is given by @xmath170 in order for eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) to be realizable for @xmath65 in the range @xmath171 we get , using ( [ pbb ] ) , @xmath172 one must keep in mind that as stated above , the parameter @xmath66 is fixed to be @xmath164 and that the parameter @xmath173 should not be too small in order for the semiclassical approximation to be valid , which imposes a constraint relating the other two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath65 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to perform a careful analysis of the prefactor @xmath64 to see whether the inequality ( [ k ] ) can be satisfied with an @xmath65 within the range available in the history of the universe .",
    "if this is not so , one could not argue that the thermalon can account for all of the relaxation of the cosmological constant and , a fortiori , one could not argue that all of the vacuum energy was condensed into black holes .",
    "in this paper , we have exhibited a new process through which the cosmological constant can decay . at the same time",
    ", a black hole is created .",
    "the classical solution describing the process is an unstable (  ready - to - fall \" ) static solution which we have called  cosmological thermalon \" ; it is an analog of the sphaleron of gauge theories . gravity and , in particular",
    ", the thermal effects of the cosmological horizon is essential for the existence of the solution , which disappears in the flat space limit .",
    "the net effect of the process is thus to transform non localized dark energy into localized dark matter , thus providing a possible link between the small present value of the cosmological constant and the observed lack of matter in the universe .",
    "of course , the emergence in this way of ( nearly ) flat space as a natural endpoint of dynamical evolution is most intriguing in view of cosmological observations .",
    "the main results presented in this paper where reported at the school on quantum gravity , valdivia , chile , 4 - 14 january 2002 , and also at the tenth marcel grossmann meeting on general relativity , rio de janeiro , brazil , july 20 - 26 , 2003 .    after this paper",
    "was finished we became aware of the interesting work of j. garriga and a. megevand @xcite , where   a ",
    "staticinstanton , representing pair creation of critical bubbles - a process somewhat analogous to thermal activation in flat space  \" is discussed .",

    "it is illuminating to see explicitly that both the minimum and the maximum of the mass curve are euclidean stable points , since  unthoughtful \" analogy with a standard potential problem might have suggested that only the minimum of the mass curve should be a stable euclidean equilibrium .",
    "consider first the black hole thermalon and perturb it , @xmath174 .",
    "the mass equation yields , @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the mass perturbation . using that @xmath42 is extremum at the thermalon ,",
    "one finds , @xmath177 because the second derivative of @xmath42 is positive at the minimum @xmath178 , the right - hand side of ( [ mequ ] ) is non - negative , so that the perturbation @xmath179 is forced to remain in the bounded range @xmath180 , which implies stability .    for the cosmological thermalon , it is now the upper branch of the mass curve which is relevant , and ( [ aab ] ) is replaced by @xmath181 so that , instead of ( [ mequ ] ) one has @xmath182 at the cosmological thermalon , @xmath42 is maximum and so its second derivative is negative . again the perturbation @xmath183 is bounded and the euclidean solution is stable .",
    "the signs in ( [ aa ] ) are in agreement with the proof given in @xcite , that the internal energy of the cosmological horizon is @xmath50 , thus the  thoughtful \" analogy with the potential problem simply amounts to realize that for the cosmological thermalon one should plot @xmath52 in the vertical axis , so that the  potential \" in fig .",
    "2 is upside down and the analogy holds .",
    "we end this appendix computing the frequency of oscillations around the cosmological thermalon . from ( [ aa ] )",
    "we find that those are given by @xmath184 which may be evaluated in terms of the nucleations radius @xmath27 of the cosmological thermalon , @xmath185 note that there is a resonance in the limit when @xmath27 approaches the cosmological radius @xmath65 .",
    "this may be achieved when the bps condition of eq .",
    "( [ second ] ) is satisfied ( @xmath186 , which holds , for instance , setting @xmath158 ) . in that case",
    "we get , @xmath187 and , from ( [ second ] ) we see that , in fact , @xmath188 .",
    "an interesting feature of the cosmological thermalon is that it does not exist in the limit of no gravity , where newton s constant @xmath53 is taken to vanish . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath53 is explicitly written , the mass equation becomes @xmath189 with @xmath190 and @xmath191 note that the bare cosmological constant @xmath15 depends on @xmath53 through @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the vacuum energy density coming from  the rest of physics \" .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath194 , the lower branch of the mass curve becomes , @xmath195 the ( minkowskian ) potential @xmath196 appearing in ( [ v ] ) exhibits the competition between surface and volume effects which gives rise to the nucleation of a bubble of a stable phase within a metastable medium .",
    "thus , in the no - gravity limit , the distinguished points in the lower branch of the mass curve have a clear interpretation : the black hole thermalon is the unstable static solution sitting at the maximum of the potential , while the instanton becomes the standard bounce solution for metastable vacuum decay .",
    "on the other hand , the upper branch of the mass curve yields @xmath197 and has no maximum .",
    "more precisely , the maximum , @xmath27 , has gone to infinity ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "there is therefore no zero - gravity limit of the cosmological thermalon .",
    "one may understand the behavior of the potential by enclosing the bubble in a sphere of radius @xmath199 and recalling that in this case , the change from the metastable to the stable phase occurs in the _ exterior _ of the bubble ( i.e. , on the side with bigger values of the radial coordinates ) .",
    "this yields the potential @xmath200 which has the correct volume dependence for bubble nucleation .",
    "the extra term @xmath201 is constant , and infinite in the limit @xmath202 .",
    "gravity changes the shape of the potential and makes it finite , so that there is an unstable static solution , the cosmological thermalon .",
