    "measurements of heavy quark bound states provide a unique opportunity to explore basic quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",

    "all relativistic diagrams to a fixed order in @xmath19 producing a charm and anti - charm quark in the final state are included . the original color - singlet model ( csm )  @xcite explicitly requires the @xmath20 pair produced in the hard scattering to be on - shell and in the same quantum state as the hadronized ( @xmath21@xmath22 ) .",
