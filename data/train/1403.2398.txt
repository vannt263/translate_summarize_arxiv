    "the shell model has long proved to be a main key to the understanding of nuclear structure .",
    "it provides the theoretical framework for a microscopic description of nuclear properties which is essentially based on the use of effective interactions .",
    "in fact , as is well known , within the shell - model approach only the particles outside a core made up of filled shells ( valence particles ) are considered to be active , and calculations are performed in a truncated hilbert space , the so - called model space .",
    "the shell - model hamiltonian acting only between the valence particles should , therefore , account for the neglected degrees of freedom , namely those of the core particles as well as of the excitations of valence particles above the chosen model space .    to this end",
    ", one can resort to empirical interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ interactions containing adjustable parameters or obtained by treating the matrix elements themselves as free parameters . in both cases",
    "fitting procedures to reproduce the experimental data are required .",
    "empirical interactions have been used in a number of shell - model calculations , providing in most cases a successful description of a variety of nuclear phenomena .    clearly , a more fundamental approach to the shell model consists in starting from the interaction between free nucleons and constructing the hamiltonian by means of many - body techniques , which leads to what is called `` realistic effective interaction '' .",
    "this alternative way , based on a microscopic derivation of the shell - model effective interaction , has the great advantage that no adjustable parameter is needed and establishes a bridge between effective shell - model interactions and underlying nuclear forces .",
    "significant progresses have been made along this line in the last two decades , and realistic shell - model calculations have been shown to provide an accurate description of nuclear structure properties for nuclei in various mass region both close to and far from the stability valley .    in this context",
    ", it should be mentioned that in many shell - model calculations , in particular those aiming at interpreting the new experimental data obtained at radioactive ion beam ( rib ) facilities , use has also been made of semi - empirical interactions , consisting in modified versions of realistic effective interactions . here , however , we focus only on shell - model calculations employing genuine realistic effective interactions and give a brief description of the current status of this approach .",
    "we firstly review the main steps and the relevant recent developments involved in the perturbative technique used to derive the shell - model interaction from the bare nuclear potential .",
    "then , we report some results we have obtained for various neutron - rich nuclei , as oxygen isotopes @xcite , @xmath0 isotones @xcite , and nuclei around @xmath1sn @xcite , to show the practical value of this approach as well as its limits .",
    "the basic ingredient of realistic shell - model calculations is the bare nuclear potential , for which , as is well known , there are various reliable models .",
    "however , we shall not discuss this point here .",
    "in the calculations concerned with the present contribution we have used two modern nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) potentials , the cd - bonn @xcite and n@xmath3low potential @xcite , which fit equally well the @xmath2 scattering data .",
    "in particular , the calculations for @xmath0 isotones and nuclei around @xmath1sn have been performed with the former while results for oxygen isotopes have been obtained with the latter .",
    "it is worth recalling that , owing to its strong short - range repulsive behavior , the cd - bonn potential can not be used directly in deriving the effective interaction within the framework of a perturbative approach . in other words , it must be first renormalized , which is done by constructing a low - momentum potential @xmath4 defined within a cutoff momentum @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this is a smooth potential which preserves exactly the onshell properties of the original one . as concerns the n@xmath3low potential ,",
    "this is derived from the chiral perturbation theory with a sharp momentum cutoff at 2.1 @xmath6 .",
    "it is conceived therefore as a low - momentum potential and no renormalization procedure is needed .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that our effective interactions are all based only on bare @xmath2 potentials , namely three - body forces are not explicitly considered .",
    "the study of the role of three body forces in nuclear structure has recently attracted great theoretical interest .",
    "their effects have been evidenced within the framework of _ ab initio _",
    "approaches for few nucleon systems .",
    "until now , however , no shell - model calculation has been performed with an effective hamiltonian derived by treating on equal footing both @xmath2 and 3@xmath7 forces .",
    "this , which would imply the appearance of further core - polarization effects on the one- and two - body components as well as of an effective three - body term , is quite a complex project .",
    "actually , only first - order contributions of the normal - ordered one- and two - body parts of 3@xmath7 forces have been taken explicitly into account . in connection with the role of 3n forces ,",
    "however , it should be mentioned that in a recent paper @xcite an optimized @xmath2 interaction derived from the chiral effective field theory has been constructed , which seems to account for many aspects of nuclear structure without explicitly including 3@xmath7 forces .",
    "let us start with the schrdinger equation for a system of a nucleons interacting via two - body forces    @xmath8    where    @xmath9    @xmath10 being the kinetic energy and @xmath11 a low - momentum two - body potential , obtained through the @xmath12 procedure @xcite or purposely constructed to have a smooth perturbative behavior , with the addition of the coulomb force for protons .",
    "now , by introducing an auxiliary one - body potential @xmath13 the hamiltonian  ( [ defh ] ) can be written as    @xmath14    namely as a one - body component @xmath15 , which describes the independent motion of the nucleons , and a residual interaction @xmath16 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian , @xmath17 , is defined through the model - space eigenvalue problem    @xmath18    where the @xmath19 and the corresponding @xmath20 are a subset of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the original hamiltonian .",
    "clearly , @xmath17 acts only on the model space defined in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath21 through the projection operator @xmath22 .",
    "a well - established approach to the determination of the effective hamiltonian is given by the @xmath23-box folded - diagram expansion .",
    "a detailed description of this approach can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , so we will not touch upon it here .",
    "we would like , however , to highlight the main points involved in the derivation of @xmath17 , so as to make clear the present stage of development .    within a degenerate model space , @xmath24",
    ", iterative techniques  @xcite can be used to construct the effective hamiltonian .",
    "these , as the krenciglowa - kuo ( kk ) and the lee - suzuki ( ls ) ones , are based on an expansion of @xmath25 in terms of the @xmath23-box and its derivatives , the @xmath23-box being defined as @xmath26    where the operator @xmath27 is the complement of @xmath22 .",
    "once the @xmath23-box is calculated , we derive @xmath25 by means of the ls technique , which yields converged results after a small number of iterations . the calculation of the @xmath23-box , however , is the most critical step of our procedure .",
    "this is performed by writing the term @xmath28 ) in equation  ( [ defq ] ) as a power series , which leads to a perturbative calculation to be performed under some approximations .",
    "a diagrammatic representation of the @xmath23-box , including one- and two - body diagrams up to third order in the interaction , is given in ref .",
    "clearly , only diagrams up to a finite order can be included and the state - of - the - art calculations do not go beyond the third order .",
    "one should also consider that the evaluation of the diagrams composing the @xmath23-box requires , in principle , a summation over all the states of the @xmath27 space .",
    "the truncation of this infinite space is , therefore , another source of approximation .",
    "both the order - by - order and the intermediate - state convergence of the effective interaction expansion are briefly reviewed in @xcite where references to previous works are given , while in @xcite they are discussed in detail focusing on @xmath29-shell nuclei . in section 3 ,",
    "results of shell - model calculations with effective interactions derived by including diagrams up to second as well as third order are reported and compared with experimental data .    in concluding this outline of the theoretical framework",
    ", it is worth mentioning two other points entering our procedure .",
    "our effective hamiltonian is derived for a two - valence - particle nucleus but is then used for systems with a larger number of valence particles .",
    "this means that we only include one- and two - body forces neglecting higher - body terms , which arise as an effect of the nuclear medium even if an @xmath2 potential is used .",
    "the one - body force gives the theoretical single - particle energies as resulting from the sum of the eigenvalues of @xmath15 and the one - body contributions of @xmath25 . in most realistic shell - model calculations , however , these energies are replaced by values taken from experiment .",
    "furthermore , we note that the perturbation expansion is performed for @xmath30 , which gives rise to @xmath31-insertion diagrams ( see @xcite ) , which are in general neglected with the exception of the first - order ones . as a matter of fact , these are exactly zero only when taking for @xmath13 a self - consistent hartree - fock potential , whereas an harmonic oscillator potential is generally used . in the next section",
    "we shall present results obtained by using both theoretical and experimental single - particle energies as well as by including or not @xmath31-insertion diagrams beyond the first order .",
    "we discuss and compare with experiment results for o isotopes , @xmath0 isotones , and @xmath1sn neighboring nuclei , which have been obtained within the shell - model framework using realistic effective interactions .",
    "most of the results presented in this section have already been given in previous works @xcite , but our aim here is to give a panoramic view of them in order to show the ability of these effective interactions to describe neutron - rich nuclei in different mass regions .",
    "one of the challenging problems in modern nuclear structure studies concerns the location of the neutron drip line , namely the limit of existence of neutron - rich systems . in this context",
    ", the oxygen isotopes play an important role .",
    "the drip line for @xmath32 is quite close to the stability valley , in contrast with the situation that occurs for other isotopes in the same mass region . as a matter of fact",
    ", the limit for oxygen isotopes is established at @xmath33 , the last stable one being @xmath34o .",
    "several calculations @xcite have been recently performed suggesting that the explanation for this limit resides in @xmath35 forces .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for oxygen isotopes is derived for the @xmath36 space with @xmath37o as inert core starting from the @xmath38low potential with a sharp cutoff at 2.1 @xmath6 , which is a low - momentum realistic @xmath2 interaction derived from the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "all diagrams up to third order are taken into account in the calculation of the @xmath23-box including the @xmath31-insertion diagrams .",
    "as regards the energies of the three single - particle orbitals of the @xmath36 space , we employ the theoretical values , as arising from the one - body contributions of @xmath17 .    in figure",
    "[ fig1_ag ] , the calculated excitation energies of the yrast @xmath39 states are compared with the experimental values  @xcite . we see that our predictions are in very good agreement with the observed energies . in particular , we reproduce the rise from @xmath40 to 22 as well as that from @xmath41 to 24 which are related to the @xmath42 and 16 subshell closure , respectively .",
    "( color online ) ground - state energies for o isotopes from @xmath43 to 20 ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "( color online ) ground - state energies for o isotopes from @xmath43 to 20 ( see text for details ) . ]    to test the ability of our interaction to reproduce the location of the drip line for oxygen isotopes , we have calculated the ground - state ( g.s . )",
    "energies , which are compared in figure  [ fig2_ag ] with the experimental values  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical curve lies below the experimental one , with a discrepancy increasing with the number of neutrons .",
    "actually , our calculations overestimate the experimental g.s .",
    "energies and fail to predict @xmath44o and @xmath45o as unbound nuclei . in the same figure , however , we show the results that are obtained by an upshift ( 427 kev ) of the calculated single - particle spectrum so as to reproduce the experimental g.s . energy of @xmath46o relative to @xmath37o .",
    "the new curve moves up coming closer to the experimental one and shows the right slope from @xmath33 on .",
    "this highlight some inaccuracy in our one - body effective hamiltonian which may be traced to the lack of three - body forces .",
    "we now present and discuss our results for the @xmath0 isotones ca , ti , cr , fe , and ni . before doing so , however , a few comments are in order .",
    "the experimental behavior of the excitation energy of the @xmath47 yrast state in ni isotopes , and in particular the sizable increase in @xmath48ni with respect to the two neighboring even isotopes , evidences a subshell closure at n=40 . for a decreasing number of protons this closure disappears and the onset of a collective behavior",
    "is observed .",
    "this issue is currently the subject of great experimental and theoretical interest ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , and the appearance of the collective behavior has been traced to the correlations between the quadrupole - partner neutron orbitals @xmath49 and @xmath50  @xcite .",

    "the first one , model space ( i ) , is spanned by the proton @xmath53 and @xmath54 orbitals and by the neutron @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath49 orbitals while the second one , model space ( ii ) , includes the same orbitals with the addition of the neutron @xmath50 one .",
    "we calculate the effective interaction starting from the cd - bonn @xmath2 potential renormalized by way of the @xmath12 approach with a cutoff momentum @xmath57  @xmath6 . as for the o isotopes ,",
    "all diagrams up to third order are taken into account in the calculation of the @xmath23-box , but at variance with the previous case the single - particle energies are determined using experimental data .",
    "more details on our effective hamiltonian , including the values of the single - particle energies and a list of the two - body matrix elements in the model spaces ( i ) and ( ii ) are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in figure  [ fig3_ag ] ,",
    "we report the excitation energies of the yrast @xmath47 states and the @xmath51 transition rates for the @xmath0 isotones as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "as regards the energies , we see that both calculated curves reproduce well the observed behavior , but the inclusion of the neutron @xmath50 orbital is essential for a quantitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the role of this orbital appears even more relevant when looking at the @xmath59 transition rates . only the @xmath59 s for @xmath60cr , @xmath61fe , and @xmath48ni",
    "are experimentally known , and these values for the former two nuclei are significantly underestimated by our calculations with model space ( i ) , while this is not the case when model space ( ii ) is used . our results ,",
    "therefore , confirm the connection between the @xmath50 orbital and the appearance of collectivity in ti , cr , and fe , as evidenced by the lowering of the @xmath62 state and the increase in the corresponding @xmath59 .",
    "to better understand this point , we show in table  [ tab1 ] the occupation numbers of the proton @xmath63 and neutron @xmath64 and @xmath65 orbitals for the ground state of ti , cr , fe , and ni .",

    "they are compared with the experimental values in figure  [ fig7_ag ] .",
    "we see that the agreement between theory and experiment is very good .",
    "in particular , our calculations give a quantitative description of the gap between the @xmath76 and 83 lines at @xmath77 as well as of its decrease when adding two and four protons .",
    "the drop of about 0.5 mev in the observed oes for sn when crossing n= 82 is a consequence of the different pairing properties for neutron particles and holes with respect to the n= 82 closed shell . when going to te and xe , the @xmath76 and 83 lines come closer to each other as a result of the proton - neutron effective interaction .",

    "in this paper , we have given a short overview of the shell - model approach with realistic effective interactions to the study of exotic nuclei .",

    "we have seen , however , that , when using theoretical single - particle energies , these calculations fail to reproduce the binding energies of the o isotopes .",
    "this may be traced to the lack of a three - body force , or more precisely to the contributions of this force to the one - body term of the effective hamiltonian , while our results do not seem to evidence the need of an explicit three - body term or of renormalization of the two - body interaction .",
    "based on our calculations , we can conclude that nuclear structure results do not depend substantially on the choice of the free @xmath2 potential one starts with , when employing phase - shift equivalent low - momentum potentials . in this connection",

    "we have also verified  @xcite that moderate variations of the cutoff do not change significantly the shell - model results .",
    "however , further study is certainly needed on this point which has been examined essentialy for interactions derived at second order in the @xmath23-box .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath23-box , as mentioned above , is one of the most critical point in our approach .",
    "its convergenge properties are investigated in  @xcite .",
    "here we point out that the quality of our results for nuclei around @xmath1sn is very good when using a second - order @xmath23 box .",
    "one should consider , however , that calculations in this region are limited to nuclei near shell closures and can not exclude that effects related to third order may appear for more valence neutrons ( see comments in  @xcite ) .",
    "to conclude , we may say that realistic - shell model calculations represent by now a very effective tool to study nuclear structure .",
    "this makes it challenging to try to clarify some remaining open questions .",
