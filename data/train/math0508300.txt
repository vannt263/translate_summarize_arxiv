    "traditionally , billiards have been investigated from the point of view of ergodic theory .",
    "that is , the properties that have been studied , were the statistical properties with respect to the natural invariant measure equivalent to the lebesgue measure .",
    "however , it is equally important to investigate the limit behavior of _ all _ trajectories and not only of _ almost all _ of them .",
    "in particular , periodic trajectories ( which are of zero measure ) are of great interest .",
    "a widely used method in this context is to observe that billiards in convex domains are twist maps ( see , e.g.@xcite , section  9.2 ) , so well developed rotation theory for twist maps ( see , e.g.  @xcite , section  9.3 ) applies to them .",
    "rotation theory has been recently developed further and its scope has been significantly widened ( see , e.g. , chapter  6 of @xcite for a brief overview ) .",
    "this opens possibilities of its application to new classes of billiards . in the general rotation theory one",
    "considers a dynamical system together with an _",
    "observable _ , that is a function on the phase space , with values in a vector space . then one takes limits of ergodic averages of the observable along longer and longer pieces of trajectories .",
    "the _ rotation set _ obtained in such a way contains all averages of the observable along periodic orbits , and , by the birkhoff ergodic theorem , integrals of the observable with respect to all ergodic invariant probability measures . with the natural choice of an observable , information about",
    "the appropriate rotation set allows one to describe the behavior of the trajectories of the system ( see examples in chapter  6 of @xcite ) .",
    "exact definitions are given later in the paper .",
    "we have to stress again that we consider _ all _ trajectories .",
    "indeed , restricting attention to one ergodic measure would result in seeing only one rotation vector . however , rotation vectors of other points , non - typical for the measure , will be missing .",
    "thus , the approach to the billiards should be from the point of view of topological dynamics , instead of ergodic theory , even though we do consider various invariant measures for which rotation vector can be computed .",
    "observe that the rotation set for a suitably chosen observable is a useful characteristic of the dynamical system .    in the simplest case ,",
    "the observable is the increment in one step ( for discrete systems ) or the derivative ( for systems with continuous time ) of another function , called _",
    "displacement_. when the displacement is chosen in a natural way , the results on the rotation set are especially interesting . in this paper",
    "we consider two similar classes of billiards , and the observables which we use for them are exactly of that type .",
    "one system consists of billiards on an @xmath0-dimensional torus with one small convex obstacle which we lift to the universal covering of the torus ( that is , to the euclidean space ) and consider the natural displacement there .",
    "those models constitute the rigorous mathematical formulation of the so called lorentz gas dynamics with periodic configuration of obstacles .",
    "they are especially important for physicists doing research in the foundations of nonequilibrium dynamics , since the lorentz gas serves as a good paradigm for nonequilibrium stationary states , see the nice survey @xcite .",
    "the other system consists of billiards in a square with one small convex obstacle close to the center of the square ; here we measure average rotation around a chosen obstacle using the argument as the displacement .",
    "we treat both billiards as flows .",
    "this is caused by the fact that in the lifting ( or unfolding for a billiard in a square ) we may have infinite horizon , especially if the obstacle is small .",
    "in other words , there are infinite trajectories without reflections , so when considering billiards as maps , we would have to divide by zero . although this is not so bad by itself ( infinity exists ) , we lose compactness and can not apply nice general machinery of the rotation theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    note that in the case of a billiard in a square we have to deal with trajectories that reflect from the vertices of the square .",
    "we can think about such reflection as two infinitesimally close reflections from two adjacent sides .",
    "then it is clear that our trajectory simply comes back along the same line on which it arrived to the vertex , and that this does not destroy the continuity of the flow .    the ideas , methods , and results in both cases , the torus and the square , are very similar .",
    "however , there are some important differences , and , in spite of its two - dimensionality , in general the square case is more complicated",
    ". therefore we decided to treat the torus case first ( in sections  [ sec_prelim ] , [ sec_rotset ] and  [ sec_arlarge ] ) and then , when we describe the square case ( in section  [ sec_square ] ) , we describe the differences from the torus case , without repeating the whole proofs .",
    "we believe that this type of exposition is simpler for a reader than the one that treats both cases simultaneously or the one that produces complicated abstract theorems that are then applied in both cases . in section  [ sec_conn ]",
    "we get additionally some general results , applicable also to other situations .",
    "let us describe shortly the main results of the paper .",
    "the exact definitions will be given later .",
    "let us only note that the _ admissible rotation set _ is a subset of the full rotation set , about which we can prove much stronger results than about the full rotation set .",
    "small _ obstacle does not mean `` arbitrarily small '' one .",
    "we derive various estimates of the size of the admissible rotation set . in the torus case",
    "the estimates that are independent of the dimension are non - trivial because of the behavior of the geometry of @xmath1 as @xmath2 . in both cases we show that the admissible rotation set approximates better and better the full rotation set when the size of the obstacle diminishes .",
    "we prove that in both cases , the torus and the square , if the obstacle is small , then the admissible rotation set is convex , rotation vectors of periodic orbits are dense in it , and if @xmath3 is a vector from its interior , then there exists a trajectory with rotation vector @xmath3 ( and even an ergodic invariant measure , for which the integral of the velocity is equal to @xmath3 , so that @xmath3 is the rotation vector of almost every trajectory ) .",
    "the full rotation set is connected , and in the case of the square , is equal to the interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "we conjecture that the full rotation set shares the strong properties of the admissible rotation set .",
    "let us consider a billiard on the @xmath0-dimensional torus @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) with one strictly convex ( that is , it is convex and its boundary does not contain any straight line segment ) obstacle @xmath7 with a smooth boundary .",
    "we do not specify explicitly how large the obstacle is , but let us think about it as a rather small one .",
    "when we lift the whole picture to @xmath1 then we get a family of obstacles @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath8 is @xmath10 translated by the vector @xmath11 .    when we speak about a _ trajectory _ , we mean a positive ( one - sided ) billiard trajectory , unless we explicitly say that it is a full ( two - sided ) one . however , we may mean a trajectory in the phase space , in the configuration space ( on the torus ) , or in the lifting or unfolding ( the euclidean space )",
    ". it will be usually clear from the context , which case we consider .",
    "we will say that the obstacle @xmath8 is _ between _ @xmath12 and @xmath13 if it intersects the convex hull of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for a trajectory @xmath16 , beginning on a boundary of @xmath7 , its _",
    "type _ is a sequence @xmath17 of elements of @xmath18 if the continuous lifting of @xmath16 to @xmath1 that starts at the boundary of @xmath19 reflects consecutively from @xmath20 , @xmath21 . in order to make the type unique for a given @xmath16",
    ", we will additionally assume that @xmath22 .",
    "note that except for the case when @xmath16 at its initial point is tangent to @xmath7 , there are infinitely many reflections , so the type of @xmath16 is well defined .",
    "this follows from the following lemma . in it",
    ", we do not count tangency as a reflection .",
    "[ infref ] if a trajectory has one reflection then it has infinitely many reflections .",
    "suppose that a trajectory has a reflection , but there are only finitely many of them",
    ". then we can start the trajectory from the last reflection .",
    "its @xmath23-limit set is an affine subtorus of @xmath24 and the whole ( positive ) trajectory is contained in this subtorus ( and it is dense there ) . since we started with a reflection , this subtorus intersects the interior of the obstacle . since the trajectory is dense in this subtorus , we get a contradiction",
    ".    of course , there may be trajectories without any reflections .",
    "in particular , if the obstacle is contained in a ball of radius less than @xmath25 , there are such trajectories in the direction of the basic unit vectors",
    ".    sometimes we will speak about the _ type _ of a piece of a trajectory ; then it is a finite sequence .",
    "we will also use the term _",

    "therefore , if consecutive reflections for a trajectory piece of admissible type are at times @xmath434 , then the displacement between the first and the third reflections divided by @xmath435 is at most @xmath430 .",
    "thus , every vector from @xmath136 has length at most @xmath430 .",
    "clearly , the vector @xmath302 belongs to @xmath131 , and thus @xmath423 .",
    "now we consider a billiard in the square @xmath436 ^ 2 $ ] with one convex obstacle @xmath7 with a smooth boundary . the lifting to @xmath437 , considered in section  [ sec_prelim ]",
    "is replaced in this case by the unfolding to @xmath437 .",
    "that is , we cover @xmath437 by the copies of @xmath247 obtained by consecutive symmetries with respect to the lines @xmath438 and @xmath439 , @xmath440 .",
    "thus , the square @xmath441 ( @xmath442 ) with the obstacle @xmath8 in it is the square @xmath247 with @xmath7 , translated by @xmath11 , with perhaps an additional symmetry applied . if @xmath443 , then , if both @xmath172 are even , there is no additional symmetry ; if @xmath137 is even and @xmath31 odd , we apply symmetry with respect to the line @xmath444 ; if @xmath137 is odd and @xmath31 is even , we apply symmetry with respect to the line @xmath445 ; and if both @xmath172 are odd , we apply central symmetry with respect to the point @xmath446 . in this model , trajectories in @xmath247 with obstacle @xmath7 unfold to trajectories in @xmath437 with obstacles @xmath8 , @xmath442 .",
    "the situation in @xmath437 is now the same as in the case of the torus billiard , except that , as we mentioned above , the obstacles are not necessarily the translations of @xmath10 , and , of course , the observable whose averages we take to get the rotation set is completely different .",
    "let us trace which definitions , results and proofs of sections  [ sec_prelim ] , [ sec_rotset ] and [ sec_arlarge ] remain the same , and which need modifications .",
    "the definitions of _ between _ and _ type _ remain the same .",
    "lemma  [ infref ] is still valid , but in its proof we have to look at the trajectory on the torus @xmath447 rather than @xmath448 .",
    "then the definition of an _ admissible sequence _ remains the same .",
    "the first part of theorem  [ thmadm ] and its proof remains the same , but in the proof of the part about periodic trajectories we have to be careful .",
    "the point @xmath50 from the last paragraph of the proof has to be replaced by a point that after folding ( the operation reverse to the unfolding ) becomes @xmath55 .",
    "this gives us a periodic orbit in the unfolding that projects ( folds ) to a periodic orbit in the square .",
    "moreover , there may be a slight difference between the square case and the torus case if we want to determine the least discrete period of this orbit ( where in the square case , in analogy to the torus case , we count only reflections from the obstacle ) . in the torus case",
    "it is clearly the same as the least period of the type . in the square case",
    "this is not necessarily so .",
    "for instance , if the obstacle is a disk centered at the origin , the orbit that goes vertically from the highest point of the disk , reflects from the upper side of the square and returns to the highest point of the disk , has discrete period 1 in the above sense",
    ". however , its type is periodic of period 2 and in the unfolding it has period 2 .",
    "fortunately , such things are irrelevant for the rest of our results .",
    "lemma  [ unique ] , corollary  [ shortest ] and their proofs remain the same as in the torus case .",
    "the same can be said about the part of lemma  [ const ] that refers to the lengths of trajectory pieces .",
    "the definition of the graph @xmath69 has to be modified .",
    "this is due to the fact that the conditions  ( [ adm3 ] ) and  ( [ adm4 ] ) can not be restated in the same way as in the torus case , because now not only translations , but also symmetries are involved ( the obstacle needs not be symmetric , and the unfolding process involves symmetries about vertical and horizontal lines ) . in order to eliminate symmetries , we enlarge the number of vertices of @xmath69 four times . instead of @xmath10 , we look at @xmath449 . for every @xmath450 there is @xmath451 , where @xmath452 , such that @xmath453 has both components even",
    ". then condition ( [ adm3 ] ) can be restated as no obstacle between @xmath454 and @xmath455 , and condition ( [ adm4 ] ) as the obstacle @xmath455 not between @xmath454 and @xmath456 .",
    "therefore we can take as the vertices of @xmath69 the pairs @xmath457 , where @xmath458 , @xmath459 , @xmath460 , and there is no obstacle between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "there is an edge in @xmath69 from @xmath461 to @xmath462 if and only if @xmath13 is not between @xmath12 and @xmath463 and @xmath464 .",
    "then , similarly as in the torus case , there is a one - to - one correspondence between admissible sequences and one - sided infinite paths in @xmath69 , starting at vertices @xmath465 .",
    "this restriction on the starting point of a path in @xmath69 creates some complication , but for every @xmath458 there is a similar correspondence between admissible sequences and one - sided infinite paths in @xmath69 , starting at vertices @xmath461 .",
    "therefore , if we want to glue finite paths , we may choose an appropriate @xmath72 .",
    "lemma  [ fingr ] and its proof remain unchanged .",
    "the definition of a _ small obstacle _ has to be modified slightly .",
    "this is due to the fact , that while a torus is homogeneous , so all positions of an obstacle are equivalent , this is not the case for a square .",
    "an obstacle placed close to a side of the square will produce a pattern of obstacles in the unfolding which is difficult to control . therefore we will say that the obstacle @xmath7 is _ small _ if it is contained in a closed ball of radius smaller than @xmath87 , centered at @xmath118 . with this definition , lemmas  [ scalar ] and  [ small ] and their proofs remain unchanged .",
    "we arrived at a point where the situation is completely different than for the torus case , namely , we have to define the displacement function .",
    "once we do it , the definitions of the rotation set , admissible rotation set and rotation vector remain the same , except that we will call a rotation vector ( since it belongs to @xmath466 ) a _ rotation number_.    since we have to count how many times the trajectory rotates around the obstacle , the simplest way is to choose a point @xmath467 in the interior of @xmath7 and set @xmath468 , where arg is the complex argument ( here we identify @xmath437 with @xmath469 ) .",
    "it is not important that the argument is multivalued , since we are interested only in its increment along curves . for any closed curve @xmath59 avoiding the interior of @xmath7 ,",
    "the increment of @xmath470 is equal to the winding number of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath467 .",
    "since the whole interior of @xmath7 lies in the same component of @xmath471 , this number does not depend on the choice of @xmath467 .",
    "if @xmath59 is not closed , we can extend it to a closed one , while changing the increment of @xmath470 by less than 1 . therefore changing @xmath467",
    "will amount to the change of the increment of @xmath470 by less than 2 .",
    "when computing the rotation numbers , we divide the increment of @xmath470 by the length of the trajectory piece , and this length goes to infinity .",
    "therefore in the limit a different choice of @xmath472 will give the same result .",
    "this proves that the rotation set we get is independent of the choice of @xmath467 .",
    "the proofs of the results of section  [ sec_rotset ] rely on the second part of lemma  [ const ] , which we have not discussed yet .",
    "the possibility of the trajectory pieces crossing the obstacles , mentioned in that lemma , was necessary only for the proof of its first part , so we do not have to worry about it now .",
    "however , we have to make an additional assumption that @xmath54 is admissible .",
    "this creates no problem either , because this is how we use it later .",
    "since we changed here many details , it makes sense to state exactly what we will be proving .",
    "[ new_const ] for every finite admissible sequence @xmath51 of elements of @xmath473 the displacements @xmath470 along trajectory pieces of type @xmath54 differ by less than @xmath474 .",
    "note that the `` folding '' map @xmath475 is continuous . therefore if curves @xmath59 and @xmath476 in @xmath477 with the common beginning and common end are homotopic then @xmath478 and @xmath479 are homotopic , so the increments of @xmath470 along them are the same .",
    "if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are two trajectory pieces as in the statement of the lemma , then @xmath60 can be extended to @xmath476 with the same beginning and end as @xmath59 , with the change of the increment of @xmath470 along its projection by @xmath480 less than 2 ( 1 at the beginning , 1 at the end ) .",
    "thus , it suffices to show that this can be done in such a way that @xmath59 and @xmath476 are homotopic",
    ".    therefore we have to analyze what may be the reasons for @xmath59 and @xmath476 not to be homotopic . extending @xmath60 to @xmath476",
    "can be done in the right way , so this leaves two possibly bad things that we have to exclude .",
    "the first is that when going from @xmath36 to @xmath481 via @xmath42 , we pass with @xmath59 on one side of @xmath42 and with @xmath60 on the other side of @xmath42 .",
    "the second one is that when going from @xmath36 to @xmath42 , we pass with @xmath59 on one side of some @xmath13 , and with @xmath60 on the other side of @xmath13 .",

    "this completes the proof .",

    "this constant does not depend on the trajectory piece we consider , so it disappears when we pass to the limit to determine the rotation set .    since we assumed that the displacement along @xmath143 is positive , then in general",
    ", the trajectory moves in the order as in ( [ order ] ) , although of course it can go back and forth .",
    "look at some region , say , @xmath568 , which is ( in the universal covering ) between the region where @xmath143 begins and the region where @xmath143 ends .",
    "after @xmath143 leaves @xmath568 , for good , it can bounce between the left and right sides several times .",
    "as this happens , the @xmath44-coordinate on the trajectory must grow , so at some point the trajectory will hit the upper side of the square for the first time after it leaves @xmath568 for good ( unless it ends before it does this ) .",
    "we denote the time of this collision by @xmath569",
    ". then we use analogous notation for the time of the first hit of the left side after leaving @xmath570 for good , etc .",
    "after the trajectory hits the top side at @xmath569 , it moves to the left or right ( we mean the horizontal component of the velocity ) .",
    "it can not move vertically , because then it would return to the region @xmath568 . if it is moving to the left , it is still in the region @xmath570 , or it just left it , but did not hit the left side of the square yet . therefore",
    ". if it is moving to the right , it is in , or it will return to , the region @xmath570 . therefore also in this case @xmath571 .    in such a way we get an increasing sequence of times when the trajectory @xmath143 hits the consecutive sides of the square ( in the lifting ) . by joining those consecutive reflection points by segments , we get a piecewise linear curve @xmath476 , which is not longer than @xmath143 , but the displacement along @xmath476 differs from the displacement along @xmath143 at most by a constant independent of the choice of @xmath143 .",
    "this curve @xmath476 goes from the right side of the square to the upper one , to the left one , to the lower one , to the right one , etc .",
    "this is exactly the same behavior that is displayed by the trajectory @xmath59 in the square without an obstacle , that starts at the midpoint of the right side and goes in the direction of @xmath572 .",
    "therefore @xmath476 and @xmath59 pass through the same squares in the unfolding .",
    "we terminate @xmath59 in that square in the unfolding in which @xmath476 ends . since in the unfolding @xmath59 is a segment of a straight line , it is shorter than @xmath476 , again up to a constant independent of @xmath476 , and those two curves have the same displacement ( as always , up to a constant ) .",
    "this shows that the rotation number of the trajectory piece @xmath143 is not larger than for the curve @xmath59 , plus a constant that goes to 0 as the length of @xmath143 goes to infinity .",
    "since the rotation number of @xmath59 ( let us think now about the infinite trajectory ) is @xmath87 , the limit in the definition of the rotation set can not exceed this number .",
    "the two trajectories in the square without an obstacle , described in the last paragraph of the above proof , are also trajectories of any square billiard with one small obstacle . therefore in this case",
    "the rotation set @xmath131 contains the interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "in such a way we get the following result .",
    "let us use the construction from the proof of theorem  [ thm47 ] and look at a long trajectory piece @xmath143 of admissible type .",
    "we get an increasing sequence of times when the trajectory @xmath143 hits the consecutive sides of the square ( in the lifting ) .",
    "construct a partial unfolding of @xmath143 , passing to a neighboring square only at those times .",
    "in such a way we get a piecewise linear curve @xmath573 which sometimes reflects from the sides of the unfolded square , and sometimes goes through them .",
    "its length is the same as the length of @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , the curve @xmath476 , constructed in the proof of theorem  [ thm47 ] starts and terminates in the same squares as @xmath573 and as we know from that proof , the displacements along @xmath476 and @xmath143 differ at most by a constant independent of @xmath143 .",
    "it is also clear that the same holds if we replace @xmath476 by the segment @xmath59 ( also from the proof of theorem  [ thm47 ] ) .",
    "thus , up to a constant that goes to 0 as the length of @xmath143 goes to infinity , the rotation number of @xmath143 is @xmath87 multiplied by the length of @xmath59 and divided by the length of @xmath573 .    by the same reasons as in the proof of theorem  [ st15 ] ,",
    "there exist positive constants @xmath424 and @xmath426 , such that for every trajectory piece of admissible type the distance between two consecutive reflections from obstacles is contained in @xmath425 $ ] , and the direction of a trajectory piece of admissible type changes by at least @xmath305 at each reflection .",
    "however , we have to take into account that the direction of @xmath573 can change also at the reflections from the boundaries of the squares , and then we do not know how the angle changes .",
    "thus , either immediately before or immediately after each reflection from an obstacle there must be a piece of @xmath573 where the direction differs from the direction of @xmath59 by at least @xmath574 .",
    "such a piece has length larger than or equal to the distance from the obstacle to the boundary of the square , which is at least @xmath575 .",
    "those pieces are alternating with the pieces of @xmath573 of length at most @xmath428 each , where we do not know what happens with the direction .",
    "this means that as we follow @xmath573 ( except the initial piece of the length bounded by @xmath428 ) , we move in the direction that differs from the direction of @xmath59 by at least @xmath574 for at least @xmath576 of time .",
    "therefore , in the limit as the length of @xmath143 goes to infinity , the length of @xmath59 divided by the length of @xmath573 is not larger than @xmath577 this proves that @xmath578 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath579 , this completes the proof .              c. p. dettmann , the lorentz gas : a paradigm for nonequilibrium stationary states , in _ hard ball systems and the lorentz gas _",
