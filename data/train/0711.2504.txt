    "the first secure identification of @xmath5he in a stellar spectrum was made by sargent and jugaku ( 1961 ) .",
    "these authors found @xmath5he in the spectrum of 3 centauri a. hartoog and cowley ( 1979 ) studied a number of stars for which @xmath5he had been reported .",
    "they listed 8 stars where the presence of @xmath5he was definite , and another three probable cases . among the field stars , @xmath5he is rare , and cases with virtually pure @xmath5he are rarer still .",

    "one can not , of course , make a credible case for the presence of an exotic species on the basis of a single wavelength measurement .",

    "[ fig : he3sh ] is a similar plot based on the uvespop spectrum , using the same he i lines as sargent and jugaku ; we took laboratory wavelengths rather than stellar as standards .",
    "hartoog ( 1979 ) noted that many of the abundance anomalies 3 cen a were shared by the field horizontal branch star feige 86 .",
    "he obtained spectra of the latter star , and found that it did indeed have an excess of @xmath5he . a modern spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : feige2 ] .",

    "w. p. bidelman ( 2000 ) gives a historical account of his identification of a strong line at @xmath63984 as hg ii in the stars now known as hgmn , or mercury - manganese stars .",
    "interestingly , it was the spectrum of a related star , 53 tau , that greatly strengthened the identification .",
    "in fact , the laboratory mn ii spectrum was poorly known , prior to the work of iglesias and velasco ( 1964 ) .",
    "thus , in 1962 , the year of bidelman s discovery , it seemed possible the @xmath63984 line was due to an unclassified line of mn ii .",
    "but 53 tau showed this could not be , since the 53 tau spectrum was replete with strong mn ii lines , but _ lacked _ @xmath63984 .",
    "there was no plausible candidate for the identification in the astronomical spectroscopist s bible , the multiplet tables ( moore 1945 ) .",
    "bidelman ( 1962 ) made the identification with the help of the mit wavelength tables ( harrison 1939 ) .",
    "but it turns out there were a number of hg lines ( not all designated as hg ii ) near 3984   , and bidelman learned , in a conversation at a meeting with the physicist richard w. shorthill , that these lines were due to isotopes of mercury .",
    "this exciting new piece of information was first published in the popular magazine , _ sky and telescope _ ( federer 1962 ) .",
    "the large shifts of hg ii @xmath63984 are caused by nuclear volume effects .",
    "there are small changes in the volume of nuclei with differing neutron numbers .",
    "these are sufficient to modify the electrostatic potential , causing the energy differences that give rise to the measurable wavelength shifts .",
    "a few examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3984 ] .",
    "many additional cases , including the notorious manganese star without @xmath63984 , 53 tau , are illustrated in the extensive study by woolf and lambert ( 1999 ) .",
    "bidelman ( 2000 ) wrote that his confidence in the @xmath63984 identification was bolstered by the presence of some hg i lines in cooler manganese stars .",

    "the lines decrease in relative intensity from the strongest , @xmath65461 , to the intermediate @xmath64358 , to @xmath64046 , the weakest of the three .",
    "the situation was not happy , however , because the stellar features did not follow the laboratory intensities .",
    "the @xmath64046 line was too strong . in a review of manganese and related stars , aller and ross ( 1967 ) referred to @xmath64046 as a line `` attributed to hg i. '' various speculations blamed the anomalous intensity on non - lte or bad oscillator strengths .",
    "the puzzle over @xmath64046 was resolved by dworetsky ( 1969 ) , who identified pt ii in hr 4072 , noting the spectrum was also present in @xmath10 crb , and @xmath11 lup .",
    "the strongest of the pt ii lines has a laboratory wavelength of 4046.45   , so that it is often closely blended with the hg i line at 4046.56   .",
    "both lines are subject to isotope shifts , already suggested by dworetsky",
    ". soon thereafter , dworetsky and vaughan , jr . (",
    "1973 ) strengthened the case for isotopic variations in pt .",
    "definitive measurements of isotopic shifts in the laboratory were made by engleman ( 1989 ) .",
    "hubrig , castelli , and mathys ( 1999 ) were able to determine specific isotopic abundances of pt ii in three stars .",

    "polosukhina and her colleagues ( polosukhina et al . 2004 ) described an international project to study lithium in cool ap stars .",
    "these workers have published @xmath14li/@xmath15li ratios in several stars ( cf .",
    "shavrina , et al 2004 ) .",
    "castelli and hubrig ( 2004 ) announced the identification of unusual isotopic mixtures of ca in hgmn stars .",

    "( 1998 ) discussed the laboratory shifts of all 5 stable isotopes .",
    "the largest shifts occur for @xmath0ca . to within 5%",
    ", all three irt lines of @xmath0ca ii are shifted by 0.2   with respect to lines from @xmath1ca ii .",
    "the largest shifts are easily measurable .",
    "cowley and hubrig ( 2005 ) found similar shifts of irt lines in ap stars of the magnetic sequence .",
    "cowley , et al .",
    "( 2007 , henceforth , chcgw ) discussed ca isotopic shifts in nearly 70 stars including an am , and fm@xmath16del , an n star and a weak barium ii star .",
    "most ( non - ap ) stars , including the sun , show small shifts with respect to the laboratory positions for a terrestrial mixture .",
    "the meaning of the small shifts is unclear , but may be related to the saturation of stellar lines relative to laboratory measurements .",
    "small displacements of stellar wavelengths are typically caused by blends .",
    "blending is highly likely in the complex spectra of cp stars .",
    "even with the relatively simple hgmn spectra , we have noted the unusual coincidence of lines of hg i with pt ii . an indisputable case for isotopic anomalies requires a demonstration based on a number of wavelength shifts in agreement with predictions ( cf .",
    "[ fig : he3sh ] ) . at the time of the initial discovery , many of the eso observations missed the strongest line @xmath68542 of the irt because of an order gap in the echelle spectra .",
    "after reconfiguration of the uves spectrograph in november 2004 , it was possible to show that all three lines had shifts commensurate with heavy calcium isotopes .",
    "[ fig:4262 ] shows that the displacements of the @xmath68542 and @xmath68662 lines are closely correlated .    in our work ,",
    "we have assumed it impossible to distinguish between weighted mixtures of @xmath1ca and @xmath0ca , and lines from pure isotopes with intermediate weights .",
    "ryabchikova and her colleagues ( cf .",
    "ryabchikova 2005 , and also her review , these proceedings ) have made careful syntheses of the weakest irt line , @xmath68498 , and find evidence not only of vertical stratification , but isotopic separations . in those stars with minimal zeeman broadening , the core of the @xmath68498 line is displaced to the red with respect to the wings .",
    "this may be explained if the heavy isotope is pushed to the highest atmospheric levels , while the deepest layers may have a nearly solar mixture ",
    "primarily @xmath1ca .",
    "these workers also noted that several stars with surface fields larger than 5 kg had little or no displacement of the @xmath68498 core .",
    "they suggested this was a general trend that might be explained if the calcium isotopes were influenced by light induced drift .",
    "the effect was found independently by chcgw who pointed out two complications with the overall trend .",
    "one star in particular , hd 154708 , has the highest magnetic field of any stars investigated so far ( hubrig , et al .",
    "nevertheless , its irt lines show significant shifts indicating heavy calcium .",
    "additionally , a plot of shift of the strongest line , @xmath68542 vs. surface field shows no trend ( even if the wildly discordant point for hd 154708 is omitted ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mag42 ]",
    "the intrinsic strength of the irt makes it possible to observe isotopic shifts over a wide range of effective temperatures .",
    "other anomalies are recognized in much narrower domains .",
    "it is unclear to what extent this is due to the physical mechanisms that produce the anomalies or to selection effects .",
    "obviously , for example , @xmath5he - stars could not be found among the cp stars whose atmospheres are too cool to have detectable he i lines .",
    "chcgw looked for correlations of the calcium and mercury anomalies .",
    "no trend is seen for the hgmn stars ( chcgw fig .",
    "the hg ii @xmath63984 line is surely present in some magnetic cp stars , but the line spectrum is too badly blended for credible inferences about the isotopic composition of mercury .",
    "preston and colleagues ( cf .",
    "preston , et al .",
    "1971 ) noted a general tendency for the heavier hg isotopes to be found in the coolest hgmn stars .",
    "chcgw found that when a wider class of objects was examined , the overall correlation degenerated .",
    "for example , the hottest star for which they measured @xmath63984 , feige 86 , showed a very large wavelength shift , indicating @xmath17hg ( cf .",
    "their fig .  5 ) .",
    "chcgw measured irt shifts in stars with temperatures ranging from 6600 to 13600k .",
    "there is no overall systematic trend of ca isotopic shifts with temperature .",
    "weak correlations may exist separately , and in the opposite sense for magnetic and non - magnetic cp stars ( cf .",
