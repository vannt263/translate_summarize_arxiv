    "continued advances in computing power and availability have led to an increasingly important role for numerical simulations in understanding hydrodynamical phenomena , and astrophysics provides a particular range of interesting applications .",
    "high - resolution , multidimensional studies frequently include an ambitious amount of physics in order to reproduce the dynamics of a system with sufficient accuracy .",
    "however , numerical artefacts and limitations are necessarily present and must be understood as fully as possible to appreciate the actual physics in the systems being represented .",
    "non - physical features enter _ ab initio _ into all hydrodynamic simulations simply because of the discretisation of a ` continuous ' fluid ( which is itself discrete , of course , but on very small scales ) .",
    "the two types of method developed for this task have very different structures : lagrangian methods follow moving fluid elements , while eulerian methods compute flow properties on a grid of points ; additionally , there are ` hybrid ' approaches , the so - called ale ( arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian ) schemes , e.g. the bethe - hydro code @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method , which has been widely used for modelling astrophysical phenomena @xcite .",
    "sph has both advantages and disadvantages with respect to other numerical techniques .",
    "one main advantage is that it automatically adapts to following dynamic flows and arbitrary geometries , without the need for mesh refinement or other readjustment techniques required with eulerian - based codes .",
    "furthermore , the energy equation is solved in the local comoving frame of each fluid element , giving a direct implementation of the first law of thermodynamics .    in modelling fluids by means of sph particles , most sph codes have included an artificial viscosity term , both for making the ensemble of discrete particles behave more like a continuum ( in continuous regions of the flow ) and for handling shock discontinuities which may arise during the course of a simulation .",
    "methods for shock - handling with riemann solvers have also been implemented in sph @xcite ; these approaches have both advantages and disadvantages . here",
    ", we focus on the artificial viscosity methods as used in standard sph formulations . as well as having beneficial effects , artificial viscosity can also introduce unwanted numerical artefacts , among which spurious shearing torques in rotating flows are particularly troublesome ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "techniques such as the balsara correction ( described in the next section ) have been developed for counteracting this .",
    "typically , sph prescriptions for artificial viscosity are a composite of both bulk and shear viscosity components , but act as a source of dissipation primarily related to shear when modelling rotating fluid flows .",
    "it is important to have some quantitative measure of how large the effects of this are , whether one is dealing with problems having no intrinsic shear viscosity or whether there is also a real , physical shear viscosity ; in either case , any numerical viscosity should be suitably negligible ( unless one is trying to use an artificial viscosity to actually model a physical viscosity , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we focus here on two standard artificial viscosity prescriptions , with and without the balsara correction .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to advocate monitoring local entropy generation as a means for quantifying the residual effects of artificial viscosity in regular flows not involving shocks .",
    "our method is completely general , but we test it out by applying it to frequently - used idealized test problems involving isothermal discs and compare its performance on these with that of other alternative methods .",
    "two main types of approach have been used previously , both of which measure the kinematic effect of the artificial viscosity and relate it to an effective viscosity coefficient , @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , there are the empirical ` ring - spreading ' tests @xcite .",
    "these are based on the analytic relations for the kinematic contribution of the artificial viscosity to disc - averaged behaviour , with assumptions of an isothermal equation of state and a small viscosity ( so as not to generate large radial flow ) that is constant across the disc . in practice",
    ", these tests can only be performed in two dimensions , as the thermal pressure of the fluid is zeroed to isolate the viscosity term in the equations of motion .",
    "these methods also require post - simulation fitting of averaged results .",
    "secondly , analytic approximations have been developed relating @xmath0 to sph and disc parameters @xcite .",
    "these relations are generally derived for specific formulations of sph artificial viscosity with the quadratic term set to zero .",
    "various additional assumptions include having constant smoothing lengths ( in the continuum limit ) and particular sph particle kernel shapes , as well as considerations that the viscosity is active for both receding and approaching particles . both of these kinds of existing approach involve restrictive assumptions and neither may be applied to artificial viscosity prescriptions that include often - used ` corrective ' terms , such as the balsara method or time - dependent approaches ( discussed below ) , which aim to reduce ` excess ' shearing .",
    "the technique presented here involves evaluating the effect of artificial viscosity in rotating flows directly from local entropy production ( i.e. using the energy equation rather than the equation of motion ) .",
    "it does not assume any particular equation of state or rotation profile and also does not assume constancy of @xmath0 or of smoothing lengths , or any particular artificial viscosity prescription .",
    "moreover , it requires no special simulation setup and is directly calculable from standard sph particle quantities .",
    "impetus for this approach arises from the nature of the sph method itself and its direct application of the first law of thermodynamics , noting that a clear understanding of entropy production is of great importance in numerical simulations .",
    "the technique is simple and quick to implement , and it allows a detailed characterization of the effects of the artificial viscosity as a function of position .",
    "several advantages of this method over existing ones are discussed , including its ease in evaluation , its direct interpretation , its greater accuracy and its broad applicability , e.g. , to arbitary rotation profiles and equations of state .",
    "for all of the simulations described here , we have utilised the public - release version of the gadget-2 code @xcite .",
    "while several artificial viscosity formulations of varying sophistication have been developed over the years , in this paper we focus mainly on the _ method _ of estimating the effects of this viscosity and therefore utilize only the relatively simple form that is standard in gadget-2 ( with and without the balsara treatment , described below ) .",
    "however , the method itself is independent of viscosity prescription , and our aim is to apply it to a comparison of several other formulations in a forthcoming paper . here , we begin by briefly reviewing in  [ sec : newtonhydro ] the form of sph equations used and considerations concerning the artificial viscosity ; in  [ sec : rotflowartvisc ] , the ring - spreading test is described ; in  [ sec : motiv ] , both the motivation for and the general formulation of our local criterion for measuring the effective viscosity in rotating flows are described ; in  [ sec : general_spec ] , example applications of our method in thin discs are given , and various simulations performed , for which the results of the local measures of viscosity are compared with those of the ring - spreading tests and existing analytic formulations ; these results are then discussed in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "additionally , in appendix [ appendixa ] , we discuss the sph particle setup used for our initial conditions , which is presented as a simple improvement to aid in reducing numerical effects and increasing the efficiency of convergence .",
    "in sph a continuous fluid is sampled at a finite number of points , and discretised versions of the standard hydrodynamic equations of continuity , momentum ( euler ) and the first law of thermodynamics ( energy equation ) are evolved , given respectively in their simplest form as : @xmath1 written with lagrangian derivatives , @xmath2 , and with mass density , @xmath3 ; velocity , @xmath4 ; thermal pressure , @xmath5 ; and specific internal energy , @xmath6 .",
    "the exact form of sph implementations has continued to be refined over the decades ; in this work , we have used the publicly - available sph code , gadget-2 , the formulation of which is derived from a fluid lagrangian and , importantly , directly conserves linear and angular momentum , entropy and energy @xcite .",
    "the gadget-2 sph equations are presented here , with emphasis on the necessity for including extra , purely numerical terms in the implementation of the continuum equations above . for further details ,",
    "we refer the reader to much more comprehensive discussions elsewhere , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the fluid is taken to have a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the specific entropy . following standard usage ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "a polytropic gas is defined as having constant specific heats , and therefore the related adiabatic index , @xmath9 , is constant .",
    "while some authors restrict @xmath10 to being constant as well ( and refer to it as the polytropic constant ) , here it is allowed to vary , and in the following @xmath10 is referred to as the entropic function . in gadget-2 , this @xmath10 is evolved rather than @xmath6 , giving the strict conservation properties of both energy and entropy mentioned above @xcite . in the following",
    ", the subscripts @xmath11 will be used only to distinguish individual fluid elements , represented in sph as finite volume pseudo - particles , and not to signify vector components .",
    "first , the mass density at the location of a given particle labelled as ` @xmath12 ' and with spatial coordinate vector , @xmath13 , is calculated at each timestep by direct summation using @xmath14 the summation is performed over @xmath15 ` nearest neighbour ' particles labelled as ` @xmath16 ' ( typically @xmath17 @xcite ) , each with mass , @xmath18 , and contained within a radius given by the smoothing length , @xmath19 .",
    "the kernel , @xmath20 , is strongly peaked and differentiable ( a cubic spline , in gadget-2 ) and with @xmath21 .",
    "the smoothing length is calculated at each timestep such that the kernel volume of a particle contains a constant mass ( for numerical stability ) , according to the following relation : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the average particle mass . within the fluid ,",
    "the resolution is essentially determined by the magnitude of @xmath19 , over which discontinuities are smoothed .    to evolve the particle velocity , the non - viscous euler equation , including a gravitational potential , @xmath24 ,",
    "is represented as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 the factors , @xmath27 , arise from the lagrangian derivation and the set of constraints on coordinates provided by eq .",
    "[ sph_hsml ] ; they account directly for the variation in smoothing lengths in the system @xcite .",
    "self - gravity among particles is calculated efficiently using a tree algorithm ( a hierarchical multipole expansion ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , in some cases we include the acceleration due to a ( newtonian ) central object located at the origin of the simulation s coordinates , @xmath28 .",
    "gadget-2 uses an artificial viscosity of the form @xmath29   $ 0 $ & \\mbox{for $ { \\bf v}_{ab}\\cdot{\\bf r}_{ab}\\geq 0 $ } , \\end{tabular}\\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the relative velocity between particles in vector and scalar form , respectively ; @xmath32 , the average density ; @xmath33 , the local soundspeed , with average @xmath34 ; and @xmath35 , a free parameter for the strength of the viscosity .",
    "in practice , @xmath36 acts similarly to a pressure term in the euler equation , and the related acceleration is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath36 formulation possesses two terms to mimic naturally - occuring , dissipative processes .",
    "the first ( linear in @xmath39 ) provides both the bulk and shear viscosity of the converging particles , and the second ( quadratic in @xmath39 ) functions as a von neumann - richtmyer artificial viscosity for shock handling and for spreading shock discontinuities over the smoothing length of supersonic particles .",
    "the quadratric term also prevents interparticle penetration .",
    "it should be noted that this single artificial viscosity provides both shear and bulk viscosities , which would be given by separate terms in the physical , navier - stokes description ( direct implementations of the latter are discussed briefly below ) . in many sph prescriptions",
    "the linear and quadratic terms are scaled by separate free parameters , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , each with a range of ` typical ' values , but we here follow the practice of setting @xmath42 ( unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "an in - depth discussion of the relative scaling of the linear and quadratic terms is provided by @xcite .    the entropic function , @xmath10 ( defined in eq .",
    "[ polytr_eos ] ) , changes , in general , in the presence of viscosity : @xmath43 cooling in optically thin material may be included in a straightforward manner by subtracting the appropriate entropy loss at the end of a timestep . the inclusion of accurate radiative transport in optically thick material is a separate ( and highly non - trivial ) task , which we do not consider here .",
    "finally , to limit spurious angular momentum transfer which arises in shear flow due to the form of the artificial viscosity , the simple balsara correction is commonly utilised @xcite .",
    "the aim of this factor is to remove the effect of the artificial viscosity when there is a pure shearing motion and to have it acting only when there is a compression .",
    "an estimate of the relative amount of local shear is made from the curl and divergence of the particle velocities : @xmath44 where the third term in the denominator prevents the quantity from diverging .",
    "the average value of this quantity for two interacting particles is used as a multiplicative factor in front of @xmath36 , producing the modified form @xmath45 , which is then used instead of @xmath36 in eqs .",
    "[ sph_eul_visc ] and [ sph_energ ] . in the following ,",
    "we examine the effect of the artificial viscosity both with and without the balsara correction ( the former case being the default ) .",

    "[ sph_hsml ] , form a complete set of equations for evolving the physical , hydrodynamic quantities in numerical simulations",
    ". however , as part of the process of discretisation , a number of additional variables and parameters have been included ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc . ) .",
    "while these are used to model realistic properties of the discretised system , such as continuity and shocks , they also introduce purely numerical features by controlling resolution , the ` spread ' of shocks and the stability of interpolations and summations . in the past decades",
    ", much work has been done to determine reliable values and forms for these parameters and to reduce associated numerical artefacts .",
    "generally , a number of standard problems , in various dimensions and geometries , are used to test the behaviour of a given code and the associated parameters .",
    "another purely numerical consideration in using sph is the initial placement of the particles representing points in the flow @xcite .",
    "for instance , regularities in particle configurations may lead to the propagation of artificial structures in the simulation along preferred directions , and even randomised placements may produce numerical features , e.g. , due to local overdensities . for each simulation presented here , the initial particle setup was created using an algorithm which maps a non - regular but constant number density profile of ( equal - mass ) particles into the arbitrary number - density ( and trivially , mass - density ) profile of the desired model .",
    "this method has also been applied in other simulations @xcite and is described in appendix  [ appendixa ] .",
    "the standard ring - spreading test starts from an initial @xmath48-function ring of matter in circular keplerian motion around a gravitating point mass @xcite .",
    "if shear viscosity is present , this ring will proceed to spread out into a disc , with the rate of spreading dependent on the magnitude of the viscosity .",
    "the matter is taken here to behave isothermally , with the temperature and viscosity being sufficiently small so that the spreading is slow and the thin disc is essentially keplerian ( with its height , @xmath49 , being small compared with the radial coordinate , @xmath50 , at any point ) . with certain additional simplifying assumptions ( negligible self - gravity for the disc material and constant viscosity coefficient , @xmath0 ) , an analytic solution can be obtained for the ring - spreading @xcite .",
    "the exact analytic results provide a means for comparison for an sph simulation of an equivalent configuration with no viscosity apart from that of the numerical scheme , @xmath51 . from the analytic results , an effective value for the shear component of the artificial viscosity",
    "can then be estimated , if one assumes that @xmath51 is roughly constant throughout the disc ( a somewhat doubtful assumption ) and that the corresponding bulk component has negligible effect ( a very good assumption under the circumstances envisaged ) .",
    "the value obtained can then be translated into an effective shakura - sunyaev @xmath52 coefficient [ 25 ] , which represents the viscosity according to @xmath53 where @xmath49 is the disc height , and @xmath54 is the sound speed .",
    "the analytic solution gives an expression for the surface density of the ring , @xmath55 , as a function of position and time .",
    "for the conditions mentioned above , the radial velocity @xmath56 ( positive for ` outer ' material and negative for ` inner ' material ) is always small , with @xmath57 by scaling arguments @xcite .",
    "the surface density is then given by @xmath58 where @xmath50 is the radius in the equatorial plane ( with @xmath59 initially ) ; @xmath60 is a time parameter ( @xmath61 ) ; @xmath0 is the kinematic shear viscosity coefficient ; @xmath62 is the disc mass ( taken as the mass unit , i.e. @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 is a modified bessel function . a detailed derivation of this formula is given by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in our work reported below , the corresponding numerical simulations begin a short time after the axisymmetric ring has spread to a finite thickness ( at @xmath65 ) using the analytic formula eq .",
    "[ sigmathin ] to provide the initial surface density profile .",
    "this same formula is also used for matching against the simulation properties at subsequent times ( doing so has been justified in previous numerical studies by the general proximity of the surface density evolution to this expression ) .",
    "self - gravity of the sph particles is included in simulations , although it is assumed that the acceleration due to the central point mass dominates ( we take @xmath66 ) .",
    "sph particles are removed from the system at an inner boundary with small radius , @xmath67 .    as mentioned above , in addition to the ring - spreading test",
    "there are also some approximate analytic formulations for estimating the effective shear viscosity of the disc from kinematic considerations : that of @xcite is @xmath68 while that of @xcite is @xmath69 these relations are generated essentially by reversing the summation form of sph equations which involve artificial viscosity back to continuum limits .",
    "further details are given in the respective papers .",
    "note that the gadget-2 definition of smoothing length has been used in each case .",
    "an artificial viscosity term ( @xmath70 ) appears in both the momentum and energy hydrodynamic equations .",
    "each of these roles affects the evolution and structure of the system , as the trajectories of fluid elements are modified and as kinetic energy is transformed into heat .",
    "the standard form of the ( isothermal ) ring - spreading test has been used essentially to analyse the effective viscosity via the euler equation , with the spreading being caused by the combined action of the viscous and several other additive terms , but it seems better to use , instead , the energy equation , where the effect of viscosity in generating entropy can be clearly singled out .    internal energy in fluid systems can be produced both by viscosity and by non - viscous compression .",
    "this is expressed in the first law of thermodynamics , as applied to a co - moving fluid element with unit mass : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the temperature and @xmath8 is the specific entropy . the specific internal energy produced by viscosity , @xmath73 , corresponds to the first term on the right hand side , and its time derivative is simply @xmath74 this quantity can be calculated directly from the sph expressions in all cases , whatever the flow geometry or equation of state , giving a direct local measure of the effects of viscosity .",
    "the only caveat is that there should be no other sources of entropy production to contaminate the interpretation .    for the particular case of the ( widely used ) class of polytropic equations of state implemented by gadget-2 , the derivative of eq .",
    "[ polytr_eos ] gives the following expression for @xmath75 : @xmath76 where the relations @xmath77 and @xmath78 have been used in arriving at the form of the second line .",

    "[ firsttherm ] and referring to eq .",
    "[ visc_en_entr ] leads to the following set of formulae linking @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 : @xmath82 within gadget-2 , computation of the evolution of @xmath83 is very similar to that for the entropic function , @xmath10 ( cf .",
    "[ sph_energ ] , [ visc_en_entr ] and [ visc_entr_entr ] ) : @xmath84 and this can be evaluated straightforwardly for each fluid element .",
    "note that in the further specialisation to an isothermal equation of state with @xmath85 ( which we will be using below for making comparison with the ring - spreading test ) , then the entropic function , @xmath10 , becomes a constant , but the true entropy , @xmath8 , continues to change under the action of viscosity , as does @xmath83 .",
    "importantly , @xmath86 is determined from the contribution of only a single term which contains @xmath36 . in quantifying the effect of any sph artificial viscosity prescription on a disc system",
    ", this isolation greatly simplifies analysis ( and interpretation ) . in general ,",
    "entropy can be produced by shearing , normal compression and shock compression , the totality of which are accounted for when measuring @xmath86 , due to its general relation to specific entropy .",
    "in contrast , only the shearing is important under the assumptions of the ring - spreading test ( or the analytic approximations ) .",
    "monitoring @xmath86 already provides a suitable way of demonstrating the local effects of artificial viscosity , and one could stop at that point . however , if one wants to calculate an effective shear viscosity coefficient ( for circumstances involving shear and no significant compression ) , one needs to write an expression for @xmath86 in terms of @xmath0 and the shearing velocity field ( see , e.g. , appendix b of @xcite ) and then to invert it to give an expression for @xmath0 . for general planar rotational motion ,",

    "this facilitates comparisons with existing approximations and , as shown below , leads to particularly simple expressions of @xmath91 ( though , it must be emphasised , that the preceding expression is by no means prohibitively complicated ) .    the surface area of a narrow , axisymmetric ring of width , @xmath92 ( centred around @xmath50 ) , is @xmath93 , and the mass of the ring is therefore @xmath94 .",
    "taking the matter to be moving on basically circular orbits , the viscous torque exerted on the ring can be written as @xcite : @xmath95 the work done by this torque leads to local heating in the rotating flow",
