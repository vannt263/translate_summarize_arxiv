    "the volume of air and quantity of radioactive atoms in a layer increase in an approximately proportional way to the surface of the layer ( or to the square of the layer s radius ) . the solid angle through which the detector could be viewed from each point of the layer is in inverse proportion to the square of the layer s radius .",
