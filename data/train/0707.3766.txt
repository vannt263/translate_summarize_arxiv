    "after early appearances @xcite and since its first formal study in @xcite , much attention has been directed to logarithmic conformal field theories ( lcft ) .",
    "this has led to significant progress , both for abstract models ( see the reviews @xcite ) and for lattice realizations @xcite .",
    "the known examples support the view that the critical lattice models described by logarithmic conformal theories have some intrinsic non - local features , in contrast to usual equilibrium models defined in terms of local boltzmann weights with no global constraints .",
    "these non - local features on the lattice have an echo in the continuum in the form of peculiar properties of lcfts , like the non - algebraic , logarithmic nature of their correlation functions , their non - unitarity , and non - diagonalizable hamiltonians .    until very recently",
    ", only a few isolated lattice models were known to be describable by a lcft .",
    "these include the dense polymer model @xcite , dilute polymers @xcite , percolation @xcite , the abelian sandpile model ( asm ) @xcite and the close - packed dimer model @xcite .",
    "the situation has considerably improved since an infinite family of integrable lattice models has been found @xcite , which correspond to logarithmic extensions of the usual minimal models .",
    "the simplest , and most studied lcft has central charge @xmath0 .",
    "a local conformal field theory with this value of the central charge has been defined in @xcite , and is known as the triplet theory due to the existence of three conserved currents .",
    "this theory therefore possesses an extended algebra with respect to which it is rational . despite the fact that the virasoro representation theory for logarithmic theories has been worked out in some detail @xcite , no consistent , complete field theory with @xmath0",
    "other than the triplet theory has been constructed so far .    on the lattice side ,",
    "two models are known to have @xmath0 : the dense polymer model and the abelian sandpile model ( certain aspects of the dimer model can also be described by @xmath0 , see @xcite ) .",
    "although none of them is described by the triplet theory , the question remains open however as to whether they fall in the same universality class , and are described by the same conformal theory .",
    "an important question is therefore to investigate the precise structure of the logarithmic theories underlying these two lattice models .",
    "they are presumably more generic than the triplet theory which , because of its extended symmetry , is special .",
    "they are also likely to be quasi - rational but not rational .",
    "it is our purpose in this article to further investigate the nature of the theory describing the sandpile model .",
    "we do this by defining new boundary conditions , and by exploring their various properties with respect to each other ( fusion rules ) and with respect to other known observables .",
    "we start with a brief description of the model @xcite ; for further details and more results , the reader is refered to @xcite .    every site @xmath3 of a rectangular grid @xmath4",
    "is assigned a height variable @xmath5 , taking the four values @xmath6 and 4 .",
    "a configuration @xmath7 is the set of values @xmath8 for all sites . given a configuration @xmath9 at time @xmath10 , the discrete dynamics makes it evolve to @xmath11 , in the following way .",
    "first the height variable of a random site @xmath3 is incremented by 1 , @xmath12 , making a new configuration @xmath13",
    ". then if the ( new ) height @xmath5 in @xmath13 is smaller or equal to 4 , one simply sets @xmath14 . if not , all sites @xmath15 such that their height variables @xmath16 are greater than 4 repeatedly topple , which means that @xmath16 is decreased by 4 , whereas the height of all the nearest neighbours of @xmath15 are increased by 1 .",
    "this toppling process stops when all height variables are between 1 and 4 ; the so obtained configuration defines @xmath11 .",
    "the addition of a single sand grain may trigger a potentially very large avalanche : the toppling of one site transfers sand to its neighbours , which in turn can topple and so on .",
    "when the dynamics is run for long periods , the sandpile builds up , and is eventually subjected to an avalanche spanning the entire system .",
    "this correlates the height variables over very large distances , and makes the system critical in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the stochastic dynamics described above is markovian and defines a time evolution in the space of probability distributions on the set of configurations .",
    "the asymptotic state of the sandpile is controlled by the unique invariant distribution @xmath17 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath18 is uniform on the set @xmath19 of so - called recurrent configurations , and vanishes on the others . to be recurrent",
    ", a configuration must satisfy certain global conditions , and this is where non - locality enters . for what follows",
    ", it will be enough to know that the recurrent configurations are in one - to - one correspondence with the spanning trees on @xmath4 .",
    "more important is what happens on the boundaries . in the above description of the model ,",
    "all boundary sites are dissipative : under toppling , since they have three or two nearest neighbours , one or two grains of sand fall off the pile .",
    "such dissipative boundary sites are called open , and define the open boundary condition .",
    "the presence of dissipative sites is essential for the dynamics to be well - defined , since otherwise the toppling process might never stop .",
    "it is convenient to think of the sand grains falling off the pile as being transferred to a sink site , connected to all dissipative sites .",
    "boundary sites can also be closed , i.e. non - dissipative . in this case",
    ", a toppling site loses as many sand grains as it has neighbours , generally three ( two for corner sites ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the height of a closed site takes only three ( or two ) values , usually chosen to be 1 , 2 and 3 ( 1 and 2 ) .",
    "all boundary sites can be independently chosen to be open or closed , insofar as there is somewhere at least one dissipative site .",
    "if this is so , the dynamics is well - defined , and so is the set @xmath19 , which will depend on the boundary conditions chosen .",
    "the transfer of sand in a toppling can be encoded in the toppling matrix @xmath20 , _",
    "ij = [ top ] where @xmath21 is the number of neighbours of @xmath3 .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 is simply the discrete laplacian on @xmath4 , subjected to specific boundary conditions .    in the infinite volume limit",
    ", the invariant measure @xmath23 becomes a conformal field theoretic measure , and homogeneous open or closed boundaries are conformally invariant boundary conditions . in what follows , we will work on the upper - half plane ( uhp ) , with an infinite - dimensional matrix @xmath20 , denoted by @xmath24 resp . @xmath25",
    "if the boundary is fully open resp . closed .",
    "the difference @xmath26 is diagonal , with entries equal to 1 on boundary sites , and 0 elsewhere .",
    "these two boundary conditions , open and closed , have been well studied and are well understood ( see @xcite and below ) .",
    "as recurrent configurations on @xmath4 are in correspondence with spanning trees on @xmath27 , the grid @xmath4 plus the sink site , kirchhoff s theorem ( see for instance @xcite ) implies that their number is given by     spanning trees are acyclic configurations of arrows : at each site @xmath3 of @xmath4 , there is an outgoing arrow , pointing to any one of its @xmath28 neighbours ( if @xmath3 is dissipative , the arrow can point to the sink site ) .",
    "a configuration of arrows defines a spanning tree if it contains no loop . by construction ,",
    "the paths formed by the arrows all lead to the sink site , which is the root of the tree .",
    "if walked in the opposite direction , the paths start from the sink site ( the root ) , enter the lattice through the open boundary sites , which are the only ones connected to the sink , ramify and eventually invade the lattice .",
    "even though the explicit mapping is very complicated and non - local , the spanning trees provide a description of recurrent configurations which is completely equivalent to that in terms of heights .",
    "the non - local conditions satisfied by the height values of recurrent configurations are encased in the property of arrow configurations to contain no loop , which is indeed a global constraint .",
    "however the spanning trees are often more convenient for actual calculations . in particular , they allow us to think of boundary conditions directly in terms of the arrows forming the spanning trees .    the simplest possibility is to force boundary sites to have their arrows pointing in the same direction , either left or right .",
    "this defines two new boundary conditions , which we denote by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the more arrows we prescribe , and the stronger the wind blows in the trees ! the results below show that a wind blowing on the edge has long range effects deep in the forest and alters the general pattern of arrows far from the boundary . in what follows",
    "we examine the properties of the boundary fields which effect a change from an open or closed boundary condition to one of these two arrow boundary conditions , and in the limit where the finite grid goes to the upper - half plane ( uhp ) . in order to review the way this is done , we start with the known case where an open boundary condition is changed to closed , and vice - versa @xcite .    consider the sandpile model on the discrete uhp , with open boundary condition all along the boundary .",
    "it has toppling matrix @xmath24 .",
    "we modify the model slightly by closing one boundary site @xmath3 .",
    "the new model has a slightly different toppling matrix which , from ( [ top ] ) , is simply given by @xmath31 , where the matrix @xmath32 is infinite - dimensional , but has a single non - zero entry , namely @xmath33 . the determinants of @xmath24 and @xmath34 give the number of recurrent configurations in both models , and are clearly infinite .",
    "however their ratio is finite , and is actually given by a 1-by-1 determinant ( because @xmath32 has rank 1 ) , where @xmath35 , = ( + b ) = 1 - _ ii = 2 0.637 .",
    "[ 1cl ] the number of recurrent configurations has decreased by a numerical ( unimportant ) factor , but otherwise , the closing of site @xmath3 has no noticeable effect at large distances . in the scaling limit ,",
    "the two models are identical .",
    "things change if we close a large portion @xmath36 of an open boundary , say @xmath37 consecutive sites .",
    "then the new model has toppling matrix @xmath31 , with @xmath32 equal to minus the identity matrix on @xmath36 and zero elsewhere .",
    "the ratio of determinants is now an @xmath37-by-@xmath37 determinant .",
    "it decays exponentially with @xmath37 , like @xmath38 where g is the catalan constant , because the effective free energy of a closed site is smaller than that of an open site by an amount equal to @xmath39 .",
    "subtracting this non - universal contribution from the free energy , a universal power law remains @xcite e^2 g n ^new = e^2 g n",
    "( + b ) _ i , j i a n^1/4 , n 1 . [ opcl ] for @xmath37 large , the closing of @xmath36 has long range effects . in the scaling limit",
    ", the ratio of determinants can be viewed as the correlator of two boundary changing fields @xmath40 , from which one concludes that the boundary condition changing field @xmath41 has dimension @xmath42 .",
    "the same procedure may be used for arrows .",
    "if we want to force the spanning trees to contain an arrow pointing from @xmath3 to @xmath43 , two neighbour boundary sites , we modify two entries of the toppling matrix by setting @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the limit @xmath46 , @xmath47 contains a term linear in @xmath48 , whose coefficient yields exactly the number of spanning trees having the prescribed arrow .",
    "consequently , we may define @xmath31 , where the two non - zero entries of @xmath32 are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "similar to ( [ 1cl ] ) , the ratio _ = _ ( + b ) = 3 2 - 4 0.227 gives the fraction of spanning trees which have an arrow between the sites @xmath3 and @xmath43 .",
    "exactly the same formula holds if an arrow is prescribed on a closed boundary , the only difference being in the use of the inverse laplacian subjected to a closed boundary condition on the real axis .",
    "one finds _ = _ ( + b ) = 1 0.318 .",
    "the same remarks as above can be made : it is only when a large number @xmath37 of arrows are forced on the boundary that long range effects develop . prescribing @xmath37 consecutive arrows amounts to changing the entries of the toppling matrix through a perturbing matrix @xmath32 , of dimension @xmath51 .",
    "the determinant ratio has a term proportional to @xmath52 , whose coefficient gives the fraction of trees having the @xmath37 prescribed arrows .",
    "as in the case of a change from open to closed , the asymptotic value of these determinant ratios can be evaluated exactly .",
    "suppose that we prescribe @xmath37 consecutive right arrows in an otherwise fully open or fully closed boundary ( when there is only one string of arrows , their direction , left or right , makes no difference ) .",
    "the boundary itself is the set of points @xmath53 ; the first arrow points from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , and the last @xmath37-th arrow from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "we label these @xmath51 sites by an integer @xmath58 .",
    "the defect matrix @xmath32 corresponding to this situation is zero except on this set of sites , where it equals b ( ) = .    the limit of @xmath59 $ ] for @xmath46 reduces to the principal @xmath60 minor of @xmath61 , and is explicitly given by _ = _ 1 ^n = _",
    "1 i , j n , where @xmath62 is @xmath63 or @xmath64 depending on the boundary condition surrounding the arrows .",
    "they are both invariant under horizontal translations , so that the previous determinant has the toeplitz form @xmath65 . using the integral representation of the green matrix on the plane and the method of images ,",
    "one finds that the coefficients @xmath66 are the fourier coefficients of a function @xmath67 , which explicitly reads ^op(k ) = ( 1 - e^ik ) \\{2 - - } , for the open boundary condition , and ^cl(k ) = 1 2 ( 1 - e^ik ) \\ { - 1 } , for the closed boundary condition .",
    "the asymptotic evaluation of toeplitz determinants has been initiated in the celebrated szeg s theorem , and has since then been generalized in many directions . in the present case ,",
    "the functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 both contain a so - called fisher - hartwig singularity @xcite , for which the asymptotic analysis requires a fairly recent result by ehrhardt and silbermann @xcite .",
    "let @xmath70 be a function on the unit circle with the following form , for @xmath71 , ( k ) = e^i(k- ) ( 2 - 2)^ ( k ) , [ fh ] where @xmath72 is a smooth univalent function , nowhere vanishing nor divergent .",
    "then the asymptotic value of the toeplitz determinant formed with the fourier coefficients of @xmath67 is given by @xcite ( _ i - j)_1 i , j n e [ ] n^^2-^2 e^n()_0 , n 1 .",
    "in this expression , @xmath73 is the zeroth fourier coefficient of @xmath74 , and @xmath75 $ ] is a constant whose explicit value can be found in @xcite .",
    "this remarkable theorem exactly fits the above situation since @xmath68 and @xmath76 have the form ( [ fh ] ) with @xmath77 , on account of 1-e^ik = e^i(k-)/2 .",
    "the other result , discussed in the previous section , about the closing of @xmath37 sites within an open boundary , follows from the same theorem , with @xmath78 , a simpler case proved earlier by widom @xcite .    in case",
    "the boundary is open , from the function @xmath68 , one has @xmath79 , and ^op(k ) = 2 - - , whose average value is equal to @xmath80 .",
    "we therefore obtain that , among all the recurrent configurations of the sandpile model on the open upper - half plane , the fraction of those which correspond to spanning trees having the @xmath37 prescribed arrows on the boundary , is equal , in the large @xmath37 limit , to = e[^op ] e^-4gn .",
    "the exponential decay has the same origin as the one discussed in the previous section , namely the fact that a site with a prescribed arrow has a smaller free energy than when the direction of the arrow is not constrained . dividing out by this non - universal term",
    ", the ratio tends to a constant in the large @xmath37 regime , e^4gn = e[^op ] , n 1 . [ open ]    in the other case , when the boundary is closed , the function @xmath81 has the form ( [ fh ] ) with @xmath82 , and ^cl(k ) = - . the exponential decay , controlled by @xmath83 , is weaker than in the open case , as expected .",
    "however the main difference is that a universal power law remains since the ratio behaves , for large @xmath37 , like e^2gn = e[^cl]n^-1/4 , n 1 . [ closed ]    let us now interpret these two results in the context of a conformal theory .",
    "the two cases involve the change of boundary conditions at two points , separated by a distance @xmath37 . in conformal theory ,",
    "these changes are effected by the insertion of specific boundary fields .",
    "therefore the exponents which control the algebraic decay of the ratios of determinants , 0 and @xmath84 respectively for the open and closed boundary condition , should equal the sum of the dimensions of the related boundary condition changing fields .",
    "we will make the assumption that the potential field dimensions are contained in the ( infinite ) kac table of the @xmath85 minimal model , which has @xmath0 , and given by h_r , s = ( 2r - s)^2 - 1 8 .",
    "the values allowed by this formula are , in increasing order , @xmath86 ( part of the kac table is displayed in section 6 ) . as the relevant conformal field theory is logarithmic @xcite",
    ", these scaling dimensions can specify either primary fields or logarithmic partners of primary fields .",
    "for the open boundary condition , the sum of the dimensions of the two boundary fields is equal to 0 , so that the dimension of both fields , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , must be 0 .",
    "it is consistent to set , in the large @xmath37 limit , e^4gn = ^op,(0 ) ^,op(n ) = e[^op ] .",
    "one should note that , since the arrow boundary condition is oriented , the two fields @xmath89 ( outgoing arrow ) and @xmath90 ( incoming arrow ) are different .",
    "in the closed boundary case , the same argument leads to fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 with dimensions adding up to @xmath93 . from the values of @xmath94 allowed by the kac table",
    ", the only possibility is that one field has dimension @xmath42 and the other has dimension @xmath95 .",
    "this may look at first sight problematic because it prevents the identification of the ratio ( [ closed ] ) with a 2-point correlator @xmath96 , as was done in the open case , since it vanishes identically .",
    "however one remembers that for the dynamics of the model to be well - defined , dissipation is essential . in the present case , because the whole boundary is non - dissipative ( and there is no dissipation in the bulk either ) , one has to introduce dissipation at infinity by hand @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the field corresponding to the insertion of an isolated dissipation , called @xmath97 , is a dimension 0 field , logarithmic partner of the identity .",
    "therefore the correct conformal interpretation of the result ( [ closed ] ) is that it corresponds to a 3-point function , e^2gn = ^cl,(0 ) ^,cl(n ) _ n ( ) = e[^cl]n^-1/4 .    at this stage , by analyzing the change from open or closed to outgoing or incoming arrows , we have identified four new boundary condition changing fields : two fields @xmath87 and @xmath88 with dimension 0 , and two fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 , one with dimension @xmath42 , the other with dimension @xmath95 , although we do not know yet which one is which .",
    "in addition to these four fields , there must be other fields which make the change from one arrow boundary condition to the other one , by reversing the direction of the arrows .",
    "we first determine their conformal weights .",
    "in this section , we consider all changes of boundary conditions among open , closed , left arrows and right arrows , and determine the conformal weights of the corresponding fields . under the assumption that these fields are primary , the conformal weights can be obtained rather easily by analyzing appropriate 3-point functions .",
    "it will be enough to consider an open boundary , in which we change the boundary condition on two consecutive intervals , say on @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "the effect of inserting two segments of different boundary conditions can be computed as before .",
    "the change of boundary condition on the two intervals is implemented by an appropriate defect matrix @xmath32 , from which one computes the number of recurrent configurations ( or spanning trees ) for such a boundary as @xmath100 $ ] . dividing that number by @xmath101 yields the corresponding fraction of recurrent configurations as @xmath102 $ ] , of dimension @xmath103 .",
    "since three changes of boundary condition are involved , the way this determinant behaves in the scaling limit should be given by 3-point functions , up to the usual exponential factors related to the boundary free energies .",
    "as we are assuming that the fields are ( quasi-)primary , the general form of a 3-point correlator is _",

    "[ 3pt ]    because the determinants to be computed are no longer toeplitz , the sort of theorem we used in the previous section for the insertion of a single segment can not be applied , and we therefore resorted to numerical computations .",
    "the values of the determinants depend on @xmath104 and @xmath37 . in all cases discussed below",
    ", the numerical calculations have been carried out for four fixed values of @xmath104 , namely @xmath105 and 70 , and for each value of @xmath104 , @xmath37 was varied between @xmath106 and 150 ( although the smallest values of @xmath37 were usually discarded in the analysis ) . by fitting the numerical data to the general form ( [ 3pt ] )",

    "to summarize , we have defined , in terms of the spanning tree variables , two new boundary conditions in the two - dimensional abelian sandpile model , and we have explored their nature in terms of a logarithmic cft with central charge @xmath0 . together with the well - known open and closed boundary conditions , they lead to seven new boundary condition changing fields @xmath232 , with scaling dimensions in the set @xmath233 .",
    "we have examined many 3- and 4-point amplitudes within the conformal setting , and have found a full agreement with the corresponding lattice data .",
    "this brings further support to the consistency and relevance of the conformal description , and adds new entries in this description .",
    "it is worth stressing again the peculiarities and unusual features that these new boundary conditions have .    1 .   the arrow boundary conditions carry an intrinsic orientation . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first instance of oriented boundary conditions .",
    "a direct consequence of this is that the boundary condition changing fields which involve arrows have a vanishing two - point function , or , formulated in another way , the metric on the space of states is off - diagonal in the representation basis .",
    "they can not be uniformly imposed on a whole boundary .",
    "the reason for this is very clear in the sandpile model .",
    "the recurrent configurations are in one - to - one correspondence with spanning trees .",
    "since a uniform arrow boundary condition on a boundary introduces a loop , it can not be part of a spanning tree and therefore does not correspond to an allowed height configuration in the sandpile . in the conformal description however , this is a rather strange and new situation .",
    "the full implications of this from the general point of view of boundary cft need to be clarified .",
    "all boundary condition changing fields are primary , but two of them , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , belong to an indecomposable representation @xmath141 with rank 2 jordan cells .",
    "the physical meaning of this and the physical interpretation of the lowest logarithmic partners ( the @xmath236 and @xmath237 fields ) remain to be understood .",
    "a third boundary condition changing field , namely @xmath149 , is the lowest lying state of an indecomposable representation @xmath142 . in @xmath142",
    "this field is degenerate at level 5 but possesses a singular descendant at level 2 .",
    "even though this singular descendant has been seen to decouple in a number of amplitudes , we have no conclusive argument that it is actually null , and so we leave this question open .",
    "the same question as in point 3 regarding the physical interpretation of the field @xmath154 remains .",
    "besides the questions raised above , there is clearly a number of other problems that need be answered before we can pretend to understand the sandpile model with boundaries . among the most pressing and important ones , one can first mention the classification of all the observables which either preserve or interpolate between the four boundary conditions discussed here .",
    "then one should also classify all conformally invariant boundary conditions present in the sandpile model , find their conformal description and determine the corresponding spectra of boundary fields .",
    "this is obviously much more challenging since an infinite number of boundary conditions are expected .",
    "it is a great pleasure to thank vyatcheslav priezzhev for precious discussions and suggestions during the early stages of this work .",
