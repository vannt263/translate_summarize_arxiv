    "the study of the dynamics of the nanoparticle magnetic moments and their stability with respect to reorientations is a problem of prominent theoretical and practical importance .",
    "in fact , it is related to the stochastic and nonlinear dynamics and to the thermal stability of the magnetic moments in nanoparticle devices including magnetic storage ones .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures , when thermal fluctuations are negligible , the main interest is in the dynamics and stability in time - dependent external magnetic fields . in this case , the problem is usually reduced to the search for solutions of the deterministic landau - lifshitz equation@xcite and to the analysis of their stability .",
    "these investigations are also strongly motivated by the possibility of fast switching of the nanoparticle magnetic moments.@xcite    due to thermal fluctuations , the dynamics of the nanoparticle magnetic moments becomes stochastic and nonzero probabilities of their transition from one stable state to another appear . in this case , the dynamics can be described by the fokker - planck equation that corresponds to the stochastic landau - lifshitz equation.@xcite at present this approach is widely used for studying magnetic properties of nanoparticle systems at finite temperatures , including magnetic relaxation.@xcite    in this paper , we use the deterministic and the stochastic landau - lifshitz equations to study some effects induced by the rotating magnetic field in systems of purely deterministic and weakly superparamagnetic nanoparticles .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in the effects that arise from the different dynamical states of the up and down magnetic moments .",
    "these states are generated by the magnetic field rotating in the plane perpendicular to the up - down axis and they are different even if the static magnetic field along this axis is absent .",
    "the reason is that the magnetic moments have a well - defined direction ( counterclockwise ) of the natural precession , and so the rotating field effectively interacts only with the up _ or _ down magnetic moments .",
    "we note in this context that some properties of the solutions of the deterministic landau - lifshitz equation were previously considered in the context of ferromagnetic resonance,@xcite nonlinear magnetization dynamics,@xcite and switching of magnetization in cylinders @xcite and spherical nanoparticles.@xcite but , to the best of our knowledge , the above mentioned effects have not been investigated before .",

    "the effects in nanoparticle systems that arise from the simultaneous action of the thermal fluctuations and rotating field are considered in sec .",
