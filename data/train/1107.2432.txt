    "efficiently allocating resources among multiple potential recipients is a central problem in both computer science and economics . in the mechanism design literature",
    "it is customary to use the power of currency exchange to provide incentives for the agents to be truthful .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that assuming the existence of currency in the model is not always justified ( @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we initiate the study of mechanisms with verification , first introduced by nisan and ronen in @xcite for the job scheduling problem , for resource allocation problems in a setting without currency .",
    "this reveals an unexplored middle ground area between the settings of the multiple choice knapsack problem and that of multi - item auctions , which has some obvious practical applications .",
    "the knapsack problem and its variations model the setting where the supplier knows precisely what value the agents are getting from any number of items .",
    "this can be thought of as a perfect verification mechanism , and selfishness does not play a role . at the other extreme , work in algorithmic game theory",
    "has generally considered the case where the supplier knows nothing about the agents valuation and must provide incentives , typically by imposing payments , for the agents to be truthful . in this paper we introduce the funding game , in which a supplier distributes @xmath0 identical resources among @xmath1 agents , each of whom has a private valuation function depending only on the number of items received . each agent requests a number of items @xmath2 , and specifies its value @xmath3 for these items , which might be less that its real value @xmath9 .",
    "the supplier can verify that the valuations are not exaggerated , and uses a publicly known algorithm to allocate the items to the agents .",
    "the supplier s allocation algorithm has an impact on the requests made by agents , and in effect , on the instance of the allocation problem that must be solved .",
    "therefore we desire a mechanism that encourages agents to be relatively abstemious , or _ not too greedy _ in choosing their requests , and thereby produces an allocation yielding near - optimal social welfare .",
    "our model closely resembles a financing competition , where multiple contestants apply for funding provided by one supplier .",
    "contestants must write an application , or proposal , showing how the resources requested are going to be used to acquire the said value .",
    "the supplier is able to verify the veracity of the proposals and disqualify any contestant that reports a higher valuation than justified .",
    "this is the verification mechanism , and motivates our assumption that agents can not inflate the reported value .",
    "however , the supplier may not be able to verify that the reported value is the _ maximum _ a contestant could obtain , since it may not know the full capabilities of the contestant .",
    "the verification mechanism can also be thought of as a set of laws or a reputation system .",
    "if an agent obtains the requested items and does not bring the reported value , the repercussions may outweigh any immediate gains .",
    "this understanding of the verification mechanism also justifies the assumption that agents can not inflate their reported valuation .",
