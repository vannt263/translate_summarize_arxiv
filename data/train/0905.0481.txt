    "most experts do not believe that effective optical depths of @xmath11 measured in the @xmath12 hi ly@xmath1 forest imply that hi reionization was occurring ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the @xmath13 heii ly@xmath1 forest also find @xmath11 in select regions , and again the view of experts is that these observations do not necessarily indicate that heii reionization is happening ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are several key differences that make heii ly@xmath1 absorption at @xmath14 a more sensitive probe of diffuse heii than hi ly@xmath1 absorption at @xmath10 is of diffuse hi : 1 ) the abundance of helium is @xmath15 times smaller than that of hydrogen , 2 ) a photon redshifts through the heii resonance @xmath16 times faster than the hi resonance , 3 ) the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is less dense and has more voids at @xmath14 than @xmath12 , and 4 ) the hi ly@xmath1 forest absorption is available for each heii sightline and reveals the sightline s density structure .",
    "previous theoretical studies of the heii ly@xmath1 forest modeled this absorption as a set of discrete absorbing clouds and/or focused on the @xmath17 statistic @xcite .",
    "this letter employs better - suited techniques to study heii ly@xmath1 absorption near saturation .",
    "the discrete - cloud approximation works best in overdense regions .",
    "the low - density igm is better approximated as a less clumpy continuum of gas that has not decoupled from the hubble flow , and it is the absorption in the least dense regions that are the most constraining with regard to heii reionization . furthermore , the local measure for the heii fraction studied here is more powerful than global measures like @xmath18 , for which the effect of heii reionization is highly model - dependent .",
    "our measure uses hi absorption to target the heii absorption in the most evacuated voids .",
    "the advantages of using the hi absorption were realized in many observational studies of the heii forest @xcite , and we argue here that this information can be used to obtain tighter constraints on the amount of intergalactic heii than previous analyses have found .",
    "this study is timely because the hubble space telescope ( hst ) reservicing mission installed the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) in may 2009 .",
    "cos will enable absorption measurements at @xmath19 for heii ly@xmath1 and at @xmath20 for heii ly@xmath3 , where @xmath21 is the redshift of the quasar .",
    "it is able to achieve higher signal - to - noise ratios and higher spectral resolutions than previous instruments on @xmath22 existing heii ly@xmath1 sightlines , in addition to providing @xmath23 new sightlines .",
    "many candidate sightlines have been identified as promising for cos spectroscopy @xcite .    in this letter ,",
    "we assume a flat @xmath24cdm cosmology with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , consistent with recent measurements @xcite .",
    "in contrast to hi ly@xmath1 gunn - peterson absorption at @xmath30 , which saturates for neutral fractions of @xmath31 , the gunn - peterson optical depths for a photon to redshift through the heii ly@xmath1 , ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath32 resonances are @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gas density in units of the cosmic mean and @xmath35 is the local fraction of helium in heii .",
    "lower redshift heii ly@xmath1 absorption obscures the heii ly@xmath3 absorption ( and both ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath3 obscure the ly@xmath32 ) .",
    "if the foreground ly@xmath1 absorption is from @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 ) , this obscuration should not significantly weaken bounds that ignore it .",
    "the focus of this letter is on absorption in underdense regions and what this absorption implies about the ionization state of denser , neighboring regions .",
    "approximately 13% of the volume has @xmath38 at @xmath39 , 5% has @xmath40 @xcite , and a larger fraction in redshift space .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : gp_heii ] ) , combined with the knowledge that the least dense regions in the @xmath41 igm have @xmath42 , suggest that the heii ly@xmath1 forest is sensitive to heii fractions in such underdensities of the order @xmath43 ( and higher series lines to @xmath44 )",
    ". will be an overestimate ( by we estimate from cosmological simulations @xmath45 for @xmath46 ) .",
    "accounting for peculiar velocities does not change our constraints on @xmath35 because peculiar velocities have the same effect on both @xmath47 and @xmath48 . ]    in order to achieve such constraints , the locations of underdense regions must be known .",
    "the hi ly@xmath1 forest reveals this information .",
    "the hi ly@xmath1 gunn - peterson optical depth is @xmath49 where we have assumed photoionization equilibrium with @xmath50  the hi photoionization rate in units of @xmath51  s@xmath52  , and a power - law temperature - density relation given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xcite . the term @xmath55 in equation  [ eqn : tauhi ] arises from the temperature dependence of the recombination rate .",
    "we use the values @xmath56 , @xmath57k , and @xmath58 , consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "@xmath50 is expected to be nearly spatially invariant owing to the long mean free path ( mfp ) of hydrogen - ionizing photons and the large number of sources within a mfp .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath34 that can be reliably located in the hi ly@xmath1 forest , the better one can constrain the heii fraction from the heii lyman forest . however , continuum fitting tends to artificially remove flux such that the flux in the lowest density pixels is set to zero , thereby preventing one from distinguishing between small values of @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite estimated that continuum fitting on average removes @xmath59% of the transmission at @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , a value of @xmath61 , which yields @xmath62 or @xmath63 absorption , is approximately the minimum density contrast over @xmath64 that can be discriminated at @xmath41 .",
    "while a more rigorous derivation of the minimum @xmath34 would be worthwhile , we employ @xmath61 for this study .",

    "equation ( [ eqn : gp_heii ] ) and the limit @xmath70 implies that the underdense elements with @xmath40 have @xmath74 .",

    "another well - studied heii forest sightline , the @xmath75 quasar he2347 - 4342 ( not shown ) , has a gunn - peterson trough at @xmath76 with no detected heii ly@xmath1 transmission and provides a similar bound .",
    "sometime before @xmath77 , the second electron of intergalactic helium was reionized by a source of ultraviolet photons ( most probably quasars ) , and afterward the helium was kept doubly ionized by the metagalactic radiation background . if a gas parcel is exposed to a radiation background with heii photoionization rate @xmath78 , the heii fraction as a function of elapsed time @xmath79 is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the heii fraction at @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 @xmath85 is the electron density , and @xmath86 is the recombination coefficient",

    "we have shown that a measurement with percent - level precision of the heii ly@xmath1 forest can be used to set a percent - level constraint on the heii fraction in underdense regions that are opaque to heii ly@xmath1 photons . in this section",
    ", we argue that such a measurement can place an even stronger limit on the local heii fraction in a @xmath6cmpc region surrounding such underdensities .",
    "our argument requires two propositions to hold :    1 .   the ionization state of gas elements in a volume that is exposed to the same @xmath93 scales as @xmath94 , the scaling expected for photoionization equilibrium .",
    "factors that appear in the denominator of equation  [ eqn : equil ] for notational convenience ( see footnote 5 ) .",
    "our calculations include this additional scaling , which increases in importance with density . ] 2 .   a @xmath6cmpc region surrounding an underdensity in the forest",
    "is exposed to approximately the same @xmath93 as the underdensity .",
    "from these two propositions , one can place an interesting lower bound on @xmath35 in @xmath6cmpc regions . to see this ,",
    "let us take our constraint of @xmath95 at @xmath96 ( section [ sec1 ] ) .",
    "using the two propositions and equation ( 4 ) to infer the ionization state of neighboring gas elements ( which provides the scaling @xmath94 ) , we find that nearby elements with @xmath97 should have @xmath98 .",
    "see the intersection of the solid vertical line in figure [ fig : heiifrac ] with the thick solid curve .",
    "in addition , the intersection of this vertical line with the two dashed curves in figure [ fig : heiifrac ] represents the lower limit on the volume- and mass - weighted heii fractions in the region surrounding the opaque voids with @xmath95 at @xmath91 , or @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( excluding @xmath101 in these averages ) .",
    "this calculation of the volume- and mass - weighted heii fractions uses the gas density probability distribution function ( pdf ) measured from simulations in @xcite , with more recent simulations with an updated cosmology in the range @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "] and it uses the fact that a @xmath103cmpc region is fairly representative of the igm at @xmath39 . averaged over a sphere of radius @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) cmpc is @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) at @xmath60 . ]",
    "it is clear that these constraints can be improved with a more careful analysis and better data .",
    "we expect that the constraint @xmath108 in a @xmath23  cmpc region is possible by utilizing smaller @xmath34 ( probably in a statistical manner ) or by using higher lyman - series resonances .",
    "for example , the measurement of @xmath109 at @xmath91 in ly@xmath3 absorption would constrain @xmath108 ( dashed vertical line in figure  2 ) . +",
    "we have shown that if two propositions hold , the heii lyman forest can place strong constraints on @xmath35 in a region .",
    "next , we argue that the two propositions are generally satisfied .",
    "we define heii reionization as being over in a region when @xmath110 and @xmath111 is much greater than @xmath112 , such that the region never significantly recombines .",
    "the scaling @xmath94 will apply a few equilibrium times after heii reionization ends in such a region even if photoionization equilibrium does not to a precision of @xmath113 ( equation  [ eqn : xheii ] ) , where @xmath114 represents a time average from the time heii reionization ended , @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , once this scaling is achieved _",
    "after _ heii reionization , this scaling is maintained even if photoionization equilibrium is not .    during or a few @xmath115 after heii reionization this scaling",
    "may not be achieved , but it is still difficult to significantly evade the constraint on @xmath35 that assumes this scaling . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a region with uniform @xmath93 that has an initial heii fraction of @xmath116 and is being reionized ( @xmath35 is decreasing ) . in this case , assuming photoionization equilibrium and using underdense regions to infer the largest allowed photoionization rate @xmath117 could result in an overestimate of the heii fraction if the incident @xmath118 .",
    "this effect is illustrated by the long- and short - dashed curves in figure [ fig : xd ] , which are not equilibrium curves but which represent @xmath59 and @xmath105 times larger @xmath78 than the corresponding solid curve ( which assumes equilibrium ) .",
    "however , it is unlikely that a region will have @xmath119 because the timescale to reach the new equilibrium state is @xmath120 , which is typically much less than @xmath89 .",
    "for example , the constraint @xmath121 at @xmath97 and @xmath39 would imply @xmath122 .",
    "figure [ fig : allowed ] illustrates this argument for a toy example where @xmath78 is taken as constant after heii reionization begins .",
    "plotted are contours of fixed heii fraction in the @xmath78 versus @xmath123 plane , where @xmath123 is the time since the beginning of heii reionization in the region .",
    "the top thick solid curve represents our constraint @xmath124 at @xmath125 . only the colored area left of this curve",
    "is allowed .",
    "the dashed curves represent @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "this illustrates that in order for @xmath128 to be significantly less than the limit we set assuming photoionization equilibrium ( or @xmath129 ; section 4 ) , the heii needs to have been recently reionized .",
    "for example , to evade this limit such that @xmath130 , the heii in the region must have been reionized over the last @xmath9 myr ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "this proposition holds because the mfp of a heii - ionizing photon , which sets the correlation length for @xmath78 , should be @xmath132cmpc .",
    "the mfp for a heii lyman - limit photon to be absorbed in diffuse gas at @xmath39 is @xmath133cmpc ( assuming a homogeneous igm ) , which is @xmath6cmpc for the value of @xmath128 that saturates the previous bounds we have quoted , @xmath134 .",
    "the spectrally - averaged mfp , weighting by contribution to @xmath78 , is @xmath59 and @xmath135 times larger than the lyman - limit mfp for photon spectral indexes of @xmath136 ( expected in the case of no absorption ) and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "in addition , estimates for the mfp of heii - ionizing photons to be absorbed in dense systems  la @xcite are similar at the @xmath78 that yield @xmath138 ( appendix a in @xcite plus followup work ) . in agreement with this proposition ,",
    "the heii reionization simulations of @xcite find @xmath78-fluctuations on @xmath139cmpc scales ( even in heii regions ; see their figure  5 ) .",
    "the previous paragraph argued that @xmath78 fluctuates as @xmath6cmpc when our bound on @xmath140 is saturated .",
    "however , @xmath140 could be larger than our lower bound immediately around the underdensity such that the fluctuation scale is @xmath141cmpc .",
    "one could then design a situation in which the average @xmath142 in a @xmath143cmpc region around an underdensity is less than our bound .",
    "however , the situation would have to be very contrived in order to significantly evade our bound , especially since current spectra show saturated voids throughout their gunn - peterson troughs .    in apparent contradiction to this proposition",
    ", @xcite detected large fluctuations in @xmath78 on @xmath144cmpc scales in the spectra of he2347 - 4342 , with the least dense pixels yielding smaller @xmath78 .",
    "however , @xcite replicated the @xcite analysis on mock data with the same noise properties , and they showed that the observed fluctuations could be explained by poisson fluctuations in the distribution of quasars and by a @xmath145cmpc mfp .",
    "it appears the reason that a @xmath146cmpc correlation length is inferred in @xcite owes to noise in the heii forest spectrum , which often results in a large overestimate for @xmath78 in pixels with @xmath147 .",
    "in fact , @xcite demonstrated the presence of this bias and , when it was corrected for , estimated a fluctuation scale for @xmath78 of @xmath148cmpc from he2347 - 4342 .",
    "related to proposition 2 is the misconception that @xmath78 should correlate strongly with the density of an absorber .",
    "the rays from a quasar will traverse many ( essentially uncorrelated ) absorption systems prior to traveling @xmath149cmpc to a typical absorber , making it implausible that the typical overdense element will be exposed to a larger @xmath78 from these sources than an underdense one .",
    "this argument ignores that overdense absorbers are more likely to exist closer to a quasar where there is more radiation .",
    "however , the correlation between the locations of @xmath150 quasars ( @xmath151 per @xmath152 cmpc@xmath153 ) and the density of a typical absorber is negligible @xcite .",
    "even if @xmath150 quasars were not the primary source for @xmath78 [ contrary to what the quasar luminosity function and the amplitude of @xmath78-fluctuations in the heii forest suggest @xcite ] , it would be difficult to make @xmath78 correlate strongly with the density of absorbers : as the number density of the sources increases , the fluctuations in @xmath78 should decrease .",
    "[ conclusions ]    this letter showed that current heii ly@xmath1 forest data imply that @xmath154 in regions surrounding opaque voids , while @xmath155 should be possible with future heii lyman forest data .",
    "these limits derive from assuming photoionization equilibrium and that the maximum allowed @xmath78 in an underdense gas element is also the maximum in a surrounding @xmath6cmpc region  the expected fluctuation scale for @xmath78 .",
    "they may be weakened somewhat , but only if the region in question is being reionized . however , since heii reionization is the epoch when a non - negligible heii fraction exists in the low - density igm , by definition it would be occurring if @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , the heii forest may be able to address whether heii reionization is occurring at @xmath13 .",
    "our constraint of @xmath156 is a significant improvement over previous efforts , which set the bound @xmath157 in the regions of highest opacity @xcite .",
