    "interferometric observations ( claussen & lo 1986 ; greenhill et al .",
    "1995a ; greenhill et al .",
    "1996 ) have shown that megamaser emission comes from within a region around the galactic nucleus whose radius is in general smaller than 1 pc .",
    "another important point is that all the galaxies harboring a water megamaser present some level of activity .",
    "this fact has led to suppose that the maser emission mechanism is identical to galactic masers .",
    "the huge difference in the energy involved is explained in terms of the pumping source : the energy source of the megamasers is the central object of the active nucleus , a much more powerful source than the central star powering the galactic masers .",
    "braatz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have recently examined the conditions for detectability of water megamasers in terms of a variety of properties of the active galaxies , but not including the molecular gas content .",
    "it is known ( heckman et al . 1989 ) that seyfert 2 have abnormally large quantities of dust and gas if compared with seyfert 1 galaxies . on the other hand liner galaxies",
    "are thought to be simply extensions of seyfert 2 galaxies to lower luminosities , photoionized by a weaker agn spectrum ( osterbrock et al .",
    "thus , the fact that no water megamasers have been found in seyfert 1 nuclei , while all of them are in either seyfert 2 or liner galaxies seems to indicate that a high concentration of molecular gas in the inner regions of the galaxies is a key parameter for the megamaser emission to be produced .    to check this hypothesis and to find if the properties of the masers are related to those of the molecular gas , we have carried out a study of the molecular gas content and its properties in several of the water vapor megamasers for which no previous data existed or were incomplete .",
    "the megamasers we observed are four of those discovered by braatz el al . in 1994 : ngc 2639 , ngc 5506 , mrk 1 and mrk 1210 . in our analysis",
    "we have used the available co data for other water megamaser galaxies found in the literature ( heckman et al .",

    "the tentative co(10 ) detection of mrk 1210 obtained in this observing run prompted us to observe it again , observation that was carried out with the same instrument in may 1997 , the antenna parameters being the same than in 1995 .",
    "a 512-channel filter - bank with a resolution of 1 mhz was used , providing a velocity coverage of @xmath18 in the co(10 ) line and @xmath19 in the co(21 ) line , wide enough to contain the whole range of the co emission .",

    "the co luminosities in table 3 have been obtained assuming a gaussian antenna beam , using the expression : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( k(@xmath40 ) ) is the integrated intensity derived from the co(10 ) spectra and @xmath41 ( pc ) is the antenna beam width at the source distance .",
    "the h@xmath42 mass has been derived from the co luminosity using the standard conversion factor found in galactic giant molecular clouds , @xmath43 .",
    "high gas temperature and high metalicity could lead to an overestimate while high density and photodissociation of co could lead to an underestimate of the amount of molecular gas , so , we have used the standard conversion as the most adequate choice .    the molecular gas surface density , @xmath44 has been determined for the region of the galaxy included in the antenna beam , except in the galaxies where this size is larger ( see table 2 ) than the co effective diameter ( @xmath45 , defined as the diameter that contains the 70 % of the total co emission ) . in the last case we used the co effective diameter to calculate the surface density of molecular gas . to determine this size we used the optical diameter @xmath10 . from the data of kenney & young ( 1988 ) where",

    "our data show that mrk 1210 is a peculiar object among water megamaser galaxies .",
    "it has a relatively low surface density of molecular gas , not much higher than that of normal galaxies like the milky way or m33 .",
    "however , its star formation efficiency , estimated from the @xmath53 ratio , is the highest in our sample .",
    "the reason may be that in this kind of objects , a significant fraction ( up to 50 % ) of the ir luminosity could come from the active nucleus itself , as is the case for ngc 1068 , resulting in an overestimate of the star formation efficiency up to a factor of two .",
    "nevertheless , there are other indications of a high level of recent star formation activity in this galaxy .",
    "the @xmath54 ratio ( where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the iras fluxes ) has been suggested as the best tracer of the ionizing photon s source ( dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "the high measured ratio , @xmath54=1.59 , in this galaxy would thus indicate a large star formation activity , in spite of the shortage of molecular gas .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of water megamasers is their variability .",
    "the observations carried out up to now have shown that the megamaser features vary in strength as well as in velocity ( e. g. claussen & lo , 1986 ; greenhill et al .",
    "1995b ; baan & haschick 1996 ; braatz et al .",
    "1996 ; hagiwara et al .",
    "these intensity variations can reach a factor of ten .",
    "the time scale of the variations range between some weeks and a few years , though greenhill et al .",
    "( 1997a ) have recently found intensity variations in the circinus galaxy on a time scale of a few minutes .",
    "we have tried to determine whether long - term time variations could be related somehow to the abundance of molecular gas .",
    "the standard agn model assumes that seyfert 2 galaxies have a parsec - scale thick torus of gas and dust that blocks the direct view of the nucleus ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "in addition to that , a large amount of dense molecular gas has been found in the inner regions of these galaxies ( cf .",
    "planesas et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the distribution of this gas could be relevant to the diverse phenomena produced by the interaction of the radiation or matter ejected from the nuclear source .",
    "the megamaser phenomenon could arise in the external layers of the nuclear torus , its long - term variability linked to the inhomogeneities of the gas distribution in the external layers of the torus , but could also be affected by other structures that are known to exist in the inner galaxy .",
    "in fact , a study of the circumnuclear structure of the galaxy ngc 3079 ( baan & irwin 1995 ) showed that there are several structures of molecular gas at different radii from the nucleus .    on the one hand the observed megamaser variations could be related to the intrinsic nuclear variations .",
    "intrinsic variations at different time scales in radio - continuum flux density have been found in one seyfert 2 galaxy ( ngc 1275 , nesterov et al 1995 ) : slow variations have typical time scales of 2030 years , faster variations having time scales ranging from some months at millimeter wavelengths to a few years at lower frequencies .",
    "all the radio - continuum variations are thought to be produced by changes in the accretion rate of material towards the central black hole . in this case",
    "the molecular gas available near the nuclear region ( scale of kpc ) fuels the accretion disk of the agn and any variation in the falling rate of gas towards the disk could eventually produce the observed variation in the nuclear radio - continuum emission .",
    "the gas present at kpc scales can be transferred to the nuclear region by a kpc - size bar that seems to be very common in spirals ( including seyferts ) , as shown by nir observations ( mulchaey et al .",
    "hence , the presence of molecular gas at a scale of hundreds of parsecs from the nucleus could be significant in the generation of the observed variability of the radio - continuum and therefore of the maser intensity .",
    "another contribution to the observed megamaser variability could arise from the small structure in the parsec - sized torus or in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) located not far from the nuclear source",
    ". in particular , when one of such clouds crosses our line of sight towards the central maser emitting region it could act as an extra amplifier of the emission .",
    "the maser variability might be due in part to the inhomogeneity of the molecular clouds , those regions with higher density would produce an increment in the observed maser intensity . taking a maximum size of 800 au ( falgarone et al .",
    "1992 ) for the gas accumulations inside a cloud , and assuming a rotation curve similar to that of ngc 891 ( e.g. garca - burillo et al .",
    "1992 ) , the time scale expected for variability produced in this way would be less than a few tens of years , compatible with the long period variability observed in megamasers .",
    "accepting this reasoning , the 3 year average time - scale of the variability found in water megamasers ( cf . table 2 ) would be produced by structures ten times smaller .",
    "it could be expected that in both cases , a high abundance of molecular gas in the inner region could lead to a higher variability of the maser , via variable infall rate to the nucleus or via the interaction of the pumping source with inhomogeneous ambient clouds .",
    "one of our results agrees with this hypothesis : we have found an anticorrelation ( fig .",
    "4 , center panel ) between @xmath44 in the central region of water megamaser galaxies and the rate of the relative variations of the megamaser intensity : ( @xmath57 , where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the maximum ( minimum ) peak flux density observed in the megamaser at 22 ghz and @xmath60 t is the time elapsed between them .",
    "the main objection that can be raised to this tentative result is the low spatial resolution of our determination of @xmath44 , as our measurements include a more extended region than the expected one relevant for the variability of the nuclear source .      from our estimates of @xmath44",
    "we have calculated the number of clouds present in the region we observed , using as the typical gmc parameters a diameter of 40 pc and a mass of 3@xmath0@xmath61 ( cf .",
    "wilson et al .",
    "the total volume of the clouds gives us the filling factor in the observed region .",
    "our results show that there is no correlation between the isotropic @xmath62 and the filling factor , see fig .",
    "4 ( left panel ) .",
    "this implies that the total luminosity of the megamaser is not affected by the abundance of molecular clouds in the inner kpc , what is reasonable taking into account that the typical filling factor is @xmath63 .",
    "another naively expected correlation that is not found from our data is that of @xmath64 vs. @xmath44 . if we suppose that the optical depth of a molecular region is proportional to @xmath44 and that the amplification is exponential : @xmath65 ( baan & haschick 1996 ) , a dependence between @xmath44 and @xmath64 is expected .",
    "however , as can be seen in the fig .",
    "4 ( right panel ) there is no correlation . due to the complex medium",
    "the radiation has to go through it would not be strange that global amplification is far from exponential . moreover ,",
    "most of the amplification is likely to take place in a much smaller scale than the one considered when estimating @xmath44 .",
    "we have not found any correlation ( see fig .",
    "5 ) between @xmath62 and any other relevant luminosity ( i.e. , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) .",
    "this is surprising , as a closer relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath69 with @xmath62 could be expected . on the one hand ,",
    "the fir radiation is thought to be re - emission by molecular and dust clouds of the high energy radiation coming from the central source . on the other hand ,",
    "the adequate pumping conditions are thought to be produced by the heating of the clouds by x - ray shocks .",
    "therefore , although one would expect the maser luminosity to be related to the energy release by the central source , this is not the case",
    ".    a better measure of the intensity of the central source could be the radio continuum emission .",
    "we searched for a correlation between the maser luminosity and the absolute low frequency radio continuum flux density of the galaxies .",
    "the radio continuum emission is the sum of nuclear source emission plus the extended emission associated with star formation ; however , most of the radio continuum emission in active galaxies comes from the nucleus .",
    "braatz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have found a dependence of the detectability of water megamasers on intrinsic nuclear radio intensity at cm wavelengths . in the lower panels of fig .",
    "5 @xmath62 is plotted vs. the radio continuum flux data available for the known water megamaser galaxies .",
    "weak correlations are found between @xmath62 and the flux density at 1.4 and 8.4 ghz , although the number of data points at 8.4 ghz is quite small .    from the correlations between @xmath62 and the radio continuum emission at 1.4 and 8.4 ghz",
    "may be inferred that the maser luminosity is an intrinsic , energy - related property of the galactic nucleus ( which could be characterized by the radio luminosity ) rather than by the inner galactic regions ( probably best characterized , e.g. , by the infrared luminosities and molecular gas abundances ) .",
    "we have found no correlation between the maser luminosity and other luminosities , from far - infrared to x - ray luminosity , for a sample of a dozen galaxies , in spite of the presumption that those luminosities could be related in one way or another to the generation or pumping of the maser ( cf .",
    "4.4 and fig . 5 ) .",
    "this result suggests that the maser phenomenon is very localized and is not related to global properties ( mass or luminosity ) of the galaxies .",
    "this is further supported by the correlation found between the low frequency radio continuum and the maser luminosity , both arising mostly very close to the galactic nucleus .",
    "the accumulation of clouds of dense molecular gas around the nucleus of these galaxies seems necessary for the water megamaser to be produced .",
    "however , we have found no apparent relation between the maser luminosity and the surface density or the total content of molecular gas in the inner galactic regions ( say , the innermost kpc ) . in spite of that",
    ", molecular gas is known to strongly shape the appearance of the central regions of galaxies at different wavelengths .",
    "high angular resolution ( martin et al . 1989 ) and high sensitivity co maps ( krause et al . 1990 ) of the water megamaser galaxy ngc  4258 have shown the importance of the molecular gas distribution in confining the radio jets arising from the nucleus .",
    "cecil et al . (",
    "1995 ) have shown the coincidence of the radio jets and soft x - ray jets in this galaxy ; the hot gas producing the thermal x - ray jets was interpreted by these authors as shocked gas pulled away from the ambient molecular clouds .",
    "the only possible correlation we have found ( fig .",
    "4 , center panel ) involves the molecular gas surface density in the inner regions of the galaxies , in the sense that it is anticorrelated with the variation rate of the maser intensity .",
    "this result can be interpreted in terms of the maser emission being produced or further enhanced by the interaction of the nuclear jets with clouds of matter surrounding the active nucleus at different scales .",
    "the combined effect of cloud movement , the small scale structure of the clouds and the intrinsic variability of the central source ( itself related to the gas infall towards the nucleus ) could account for the observed variability of the megamaser intensity .",
    "this scenario is neither meant to explain maser variability at all time scales , nor all the subtleties observed in water maser variability , but to qualitatively show that one aspect of the variability ( its rate of amplitude variations ) could be somehow related to the abundance of molecular gas around the nucleus .",
    "we have searched for molecular gas towards the nucleus of four galaxies known to harbor a water vapor megamaser , and detected the co(10 ) emission in three of them and the co(21 ) emission in one . with this work 12 of the 18 known water megamaser galaxies",
    "have been observed in co , and only the most distant of the observed ones , mrk 1 , has not been detected yet .    1 .   the 12 water megamaser galaxies with molecular gas data available are not an homogeneous set regarding their molecular gas properties .",
    "the amount of h@xmath42 in their circumnuclear regions ranges from 5@xmath0@xmath70 to 6@xmath0@xmath71 .",
    "the extreme values of the h@xmath42 surface density , @xmath44 , for the central kpc are 6 and 280  pc@xmath72 .",
    "this parameter extends over a range of 2 orders of magnitude , a range similar to that of seyfert galaxies , starburst galaxies or luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "the maser luminosity , @xmath62 , is not correlated to the total molecular gas mass .",
    "therefore it seems that the total amount of molecular gas in the inner few kpc is not a fundamental parameter on which depends the existence and the average intensity of the water megamaser .",
    "@xmath62 is not correlated with @xmath44 or to the filling factor of giant molecular clouds .",
    "apparently the maser luminosity does not depend on the content of molecular gas in the inner kpc .",
    "however , the accumulation of clouds of dense molecular gas is believed to be necessary for the generation of a water megamaser .",
    "observations with higher angular resolution of the molecular gas in the inner regions would help to solve the issue .",
    "the only correlation we have found involving the maser emission and molecular gas parameters is between the rate of relative variation of the maser intensity and @xmath44 .",
    "this fact may indicate that a high abundance of molecular gas in the inner regions could lead to higher variability in the maser emission , on the one hand , due to the higher variability of the central pumping source produced by wider variations in the gas infall ; on the other hand , due to the more frequent interactions of the pumping agent with molecular gas condensations .",
    "@xmath62 is not correlated to any other luminosity ( infrared , optical , x - ray , blue ) .",
    "however , we have found some correlation between @xmath62 and the global radio continuum flux density at 1.4 and 8.4 ghz .",
    "this fact supports the idea that @xmath62 is a property related to the galactic nucleus ( characterized by the radio luminosities ) rather than to the inner galactic regions ( characterized by the infrared luminosity and the molecular gas content ) .",
    "mrk 1210 stands as a peculiar object , having the highest star formation efficiency among water megamaser galaxies is spite of its relatively low molecular gas content .",

    "<S> have been observed in co.    the molecular gas content in the inner regions of water megamaser galaxies ranges from 5@xmath0@xmath1 to 6@xmath0@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the circumnuclear molecular gas surface density also extends over nearly two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the maser luminosity is correlated neither with the total amount of molecular gas found in the inner few kpc of these galaxies nor with global properties of the molecular gas such as surface density or filling factor ; it is also independent of the infrared and optical luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the only significant correlation we have found involves the maser luminosity and the low frequency radio continuum flux density . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the maser activity is intrinsically related to the energy of the active galactic nucleus whereas the intensity and even the presence of a water megamaser is independent of the molecular gas global properties such as the molecular gas content and surface density in the inner galactic regions .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also found a possible anticorrelation between the molecular gas surface density and the rate of the megamaser variations . </S>",
    "<S> a higher molecular gas abundance in the inner region could lead to higher maser variability because of larger nuclear flux variations due to the more variable gas infall , and/or because of more frequent interactions of the pumping agent with molecular gas condensations .    </S>",
