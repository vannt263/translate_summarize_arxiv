    "observations by the infrared astronomy satellite ( @xmath0 ) led to the discovery of a class of galaxies with enormous far - ir luminosities .",
    "subsequent observations over a large range of wavelengths have shown that these objects , called ulig for ultraluminous infrared galaxies , have 1 ) bolometric luminosities and space densities comparable to those of optical quasars ( sanders et al .  1988 ) ; 2 ) a broad range in host galaxy spectral type , including starburst galaxies , seyfert i and ii , radio galaxies , and quasars ; 3 ) morphologies often suggestive of recent interactions or merging ( carico et al .  1990 ; leech et al.1994 ; rigopoulou et al .",
    "1999 ) ; and 4 ) large amounts of molecular gas concentrated in small ( @xmath91 kpc ) central regions ( e.g.  scoville et al .  1989 ; solomon et al .  1997 ) . understanding the nature of the prime energy source in ulig",
    "has proven difficult ( e.g.  smith , lonsdale , & lonsdale 1998 ) .",
    "many of the observed characteristics indicate that very strong starbursts could be the culprit .",
    "alternatively , an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) may power the ulig ( e.g.  lonsdale , smith , & lonsdale 1993 ) .",
    "the very high luminosities suggest an evolutionary connection between ulig and quasars , wherein a dust - enshrouded central massive black hole is gradually revealed as the appearance of the object changes from ulig to quasar ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "much effort has been expended in trying to determine the primary source of energy ",
    "starbursts or agn  driving the large fir luminosities .",
    "the recent studies using iso indicate that the vast majority of the power comes from starbursts in @xmath10 of the observed systems ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; lutz et al .  1998 ) .",
    "rigopoulou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) present the results of an expanded version of the mid - ir spectroscopic survey first reported by genzel et al .",
    "using iso to observe 62 ulig at @xmath11 , they measured the line to continuum ratio of the 7.7 @xmath1 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) feature to differentiate between starburst and agn as the dominant source of the large fir luminosity .",
    "pah features have been shown to be strong in starburst galaxies and weak in agn ( moorwood 1986 ; roche et al .",
    "rigopoulou et al .",
    "confirmed the results of genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and also found , based on near - ir imaging , that approximately 2/3 of their sample have double nuclei and nearly all the objects show signs of interactions .",
    "for a recent review of ulig see sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) .",
    "ulig are also of great interest for studies of early star formation in the building of galaxies .",
    "recent sub - mm observations suggest that objects similar to ulig may contain a significant fraction of the star formation at high redshifts ( e.g.  lilly et al .",
    "but so far most studies have found ulig only in the nearby universe .",
    "sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) initially studied a group of 10 objects at @xmath12 .",
    "previously published systematic surveys have found objects mostly at @xmath13 ( leech et al .",
    "1994 ; clements et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "a few high redshifts objects have been found , all of which turn out to contain hidden agn .",
    "these include fsc  15307 + 3252 at @xmath14 ( cutri et al .",
    "1994 ) and fsc  10214 + 4724 at @xmath15 ( rowan - robinson et al.1991 ) .",
    "the former object was found to exhibit a highly polarized continuum , indicating the presence of a buried quasar ( hines et al.1995 ) while the latter was found to be lensed ( eisenhardt et al.1996 ) and also shows signs of containing a hidden agn ( lawrence et al .",
    "1993 ; elston et al .  1994",
    "; goodrich et al .  1996 ) .",
    "further progress in this field has been hampered by the lack of identified ulig at moderately high redshifts .",
    "no new deep far - ir survey will become available prior to the launch of _ sirtf _ , which will be capable of studying ulig in detail at high redshifts .",
    "so , the @xmath0 database remains the primary source of targets for finding high redshift ulig .",
    "radio observations provide a relatively unbiased method for extracting fir galaxies from the @xmath0 faint source catalog ( fsc ; moshir et al .",
    "1992 ) because radio continuum emission is relatively unaffected by extinction in dense gas and dust .",
    "such fir / radio samples are ideal for detailed investigations of the complex relationships between the interstellar media , starbursts , and possible agn in ulig . for example , a sample of radio - loud objects was constructed by cross - correlating the @xmath0 fsc with the texas 365 mhz radio catalog ( txfs ; dey & van breugel 1990 ) .",
    "subsequent optical identifications and spectroscopy showed that the txfs objects tend to be distant agn .",
    "so a radio - quiet sample , extracted from the fsc , should be an excellent means of finding ulig without agn  i.e .",
    "powered by starbursts  at interesting cosmological distances . in this paper",
    ", we report on such a sample : we describe the sample selection process and discuss the near - ir imaging .",
    "we defer a detailed analysis of the radio properties and optical spectroscopy to future papers .",
    "we have used two large area surveys in the radio and far - ir , which we briefly describe here , to select ulig candidates . in the radio , we have used the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm ; becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) . using the vla , this project is surveying @xmath16 steradians down to a 5@xmath17 limit of 1 mjy with 5 arcsec resolution and subarcsec positional accuracy .",
    "one of the problems with finding distant ulig using @xmath0 is that there are many faint galaxies visible in a deep optical image within the relatively large error ellipse of an fir source .",
    "the high resolution and good positional information of first offer an excellent means of choosing the best of the many optical candidates on which to spend valuable large telescope time getting redshifts .",
    "we used the second version of the catalog ( released 1995 october 16 ) , which samples 2925 degrees@xmath18 in two regions of sky in the north ( @xmath19 ra(j2000 ) @xmath20 , @xmath21 dec(j2000 ) @xmath22 ) and south ( @xmath23 ra(j2000 ) @xmath24 , @xmath25 dec(j2000 ) @xmath26 ) galactic caps . in the far - ir",
    "we have used the @xmath0 fsc ( moshir et al .",
    "1992 ) which resulted from the faint source survey ( fss ) .",
    "relative to the @xmath0 point source catalog , the fss achieved better sensitivity by point - source filtering the detector data streams and then coadding those data before finding sources . at 60",
    "( the band used for defining our candidates ) , the fsc covers the sky at @xmath27 and has a reliability ( integrated over all signal - to - noise ratios ) of @xmath28 .",
    "the limiting 60  @xmath1 m flux density of the fsc is approximately 0.2 jy , where the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is @xmath75 .",
    "the fss also resulted in the faint source reject file which contains extracted sources not in the fsc with an snr above 3.0 .",
    "we used the fsr , in addition to the fsc , with part of first to increase the number of targets in the fall sky .",
    "the @xmath0 fsc was positionally cross - correlated with the second version of the first catalog , with the requirements that an fsc source must have a real 60 @xmath1 m detection ( @xmath29 ) and that it be within 60 arcsec of the first source .",
    "the 60 @xmath1 m band was chosen because it is more reliable than the 100 @xmath1 m band and samples close to the wavelength peak of the ulig power . the resulting first - fsc ( ff ) catalog contains 2328 matches .",
    "to increase the available objects in the fall sky , we also performed a positional match of the fsr with the south galactic cap portion of first , which yielded an additional 176 matches .",
    "the 20 cm and 60 @xmath1 m flux densities for this sample of 2504 sources are plotted in figure  [ f20v60 ] .",
    "the majority of the ff sources fall along the well - known radio - fir correlation ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) , extending from nearby starburst galaxies to much fainter fir / radio flux levels .",
    "the surface density of such objects is approximately 1 degree@xmath30 down to the @xmath31 limits of 1 mjy at 20  cm and @xmath70.2 jy at 60 @xmath1 m .",
    "we generated optical finding charts using the digitized sky surveys , available from the space telescope science institute , for all 2504 matches .",
    "the radio source position and the fsc error ellipse were overlaid on these charts .",
    "visual inspection of these finding charts was carried out to select optically faint targets for further study , with the expectation that such targets would be distant ulig .",
    "approximately 150 targets , which will carry the designation ff along with the usual coordinate naming scheme , were selected in this manner . a strict cutoff in optical magnitude",
    "was not employed , and we make no attempt to construct a sample which has a well - defined limiting magnitude in the optical . in practice ,",
    "the magnitude of the targets selected for optical imaging and spectroscopy depended on the observing conditions , i.e.  some targets which are not visually faint on the dss image were observed during cloudy conditions . while the first and fsc catalogs do have well - defined flux limits , our sample was not constructed in order to be complete to a chosen flux level in either the radio nor the far - ir bands . the main goal of the survey is simply to find high - redshift ulig .",
    "it is worth noting that our target list would include objects with observed characteristics in the radio , optical , and far - ir similar to those of fsc10214 + 4724 ( which itself lies outside of the first area that we used and so can not fall into our catalog ) .",
    "we have not found any ulig at redshifts as great as that of fsc10214 + 4724 in the @xmath73000 degree@xmath18 surveyed .",
    "during several runs from march 1996 to april 1999 , the kast spectrograph ( miller & stone 1994 ) at the shane 3  m telescope of lick observatory was used to obtain optical images and spectroscopy of the candidate ulig from our ff catalog .",
    "the observing procedure typically consisted of taking two 300  s images in the @xmath32 band , identifying the optical counterpart of the ff source in these data , and immediately following up with slit spectroscopy of the optical object .",
    "because the resolution and positional accuracy of first are high , it was usually clear which optical object coincided with the radio source .",
    "the fwhm of the seeing in the images was usually in the range 1.52.0 arcsec .",
    "standard stars were observed in imaging mode when conditions were photometric . however , because much of the data were obtained during non - photometric conditions , @xmath32 magnitudes will not be presented here for the sample . unless the source morphology demanded a particular value , the position angle of the slit was set to the parallactic angle .",
    "the object was dithered along the slit by @xmath33 arcsec between two exposures to aid in fringe subtraction .",
    "optical spectra of 1200 - 6000s duration were obtained of the optical source using the 300 line mm@xmath34 grating in the red - side spectrograph , which provides @xmath74.6   pixel@xmath34 resolution from 507010590  , and a 452/3306 grism in the blue - side spectrograph which provides @xmath72.5    pixel@xmath34 resolution from 30005900  .",
    "the slit width was set at 2 arcsec .",
    "the images and spectra were reduced using standard techniques .    near - infrared images",
    "were obtained of the targets for which redshifts had been determined in order to better ascertain the morphologies of the galaxies .",
    "@xmath35 images were obtained for nearly all identified targets with nsfcam at the irtf 3  m telescope in 1998 august and 1999 february .",
    "additional observations of 3 targets were obtained in service mode in september 1999 .",
    "nsfcam was used in its 0.3 arcsec pixel@xmath34 mode which provides a 77@xmath3677 arcsec field .",
    "typical total exposure times per object were 960s ; more distant objects were observed for twice this period .",
    "conditions were photometric with seeing averaging 0.9 arcsec .",
    "observations of standard stars from the persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) list were obtained and used to calibrate the images onto the california institute of technology ( cit ) system , which is defined in elias et al .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques .",
    "five targets were observed in the @xmath5 band using gemini ( mclean et al .",
    "1993 ) at the shane 3  m telescope on 1998 october 7 .",
    "gemini has 0.68 arcsec pixels which give it a 174 arcsec field .",
    "objects were observed for 1080  s each in photometric conditions with seeing of @xmath71.2 arcsec .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques and calibrated onto the cit system using observations of ukirt faint source standards ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) .",
    "two distant targets were imaged at the keck i telescope with nirc ( matthews & soifer 1994 ) in 1998 april .",
    "ff1106 + 3201 was observed in the @xmath5 band for 16 minutes and ff1614 + 3234 was observed for 32 minutes in the @xmath37 band .",
    "both objects were observed in clear conditions with @xmath70.5 arcsec seeing .",
    "these data were reduced using standard techniques and calibrated onto the cit system using observations of ukirt faint source standards ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) .",
    "we attempted spectroscopic observations of approximately 150 iras / first candidates , of which 116 yielded redshift information .",
    "the 108 with infrared imaging are listed in table 1 ; the 8 sources with redshifts but lacking infrared images are not considered further .",
    "the sources which did not provide useful spectra were usually observed in poor conditions ; the reasons for their lack of redshifts were not because of having intrinsically challenging spectra .",
    "the object names in table 1 are based on the first radio position .",
    "the source in the first catalog would have the name given by the object s coordinates shown in our table 1 , in the format first j_hhmmss.s+ddmmss _ where the coordinates are truncated , not rounded . in the @xmath0 fsc , the fir source name is different from that implied by our ff name , so we have included the fsc source name as a column in table 1 .",
    "the z designation in the fsc name means that the fir source is from the fsr catalog .    the typical resolution of the spectroscopy was @xmath38   ( fwhm ) at @xmath39  , implying typical uncertainties of @xmath40 in redshift .",
    "redshifts were determined from the spectra after identifying probable emission lines and continuum features . in practice the features most often used were the [ o ii]@xmath413727 , [ o iii]@xmath414959,5007 , and h@xmath42 lines , and the d4000 break .",
    "the vast majority of the spectra have the emission lines characteristic of star formation ; very few show any signs , such as high ionization lines , of an agn .",
    "four sample spectra , covering a range in redshift , signal to noise , and spectral type , are shown in figure  [ spex ] . a more detailed analysis of the optical spectra",
    "is deferred to a later paper .",
    "the @xmath35 images are displayed for each object , along with the optical finding chart from the dss , in figure  [ optir ] .",
    "photometry of the ff objects was obtained from the @xmath35 images . in table 1 ,",
    "the @xmath5 magnitudes within 3 arcsec diameter apertures , centered on the peak of the near - ir emission , are given for each object .",
    "the 5 @xmath17 detection limit in most of the images is @xmath43 so the limiting factor in the uncertainty of the photometry is not the signal to noise , since most objects have magnitudes some 34 magnitudes brighter than the detection limit , but rather systematics in the zeropoint .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainty in the zeropoint is @xmath44 mag . for most objects the 3 arcsec diameter aperture contains @xmath45 of the total light .",
    "the morphologies of the objects tend to show signs of galaxy interactions , including tidal tails , multiple nuclei , and disturbed outer envelopes .",
    "approximately 2/3 of the sample show such features , while 1/3 of the sample appear to be normal galaxies . a brief description of the near - ir morphology for each ff is included in table 1 .",
    "one of the major advantages of using first in our survey is the high accuracy of its positional information .",
    "the coordinates listed in table 1 are those of the radio source as given by the first catalog , which has an absolute astrometric uncertainty of @xmath71 arcsec .",
    "the 20  cm vla images of all objects listed in table 1 were extracted from the first database .",
    "the radio morphologies were classified by visual inspection of these cutout images , and by consulting the deconvolved sizes listed in the first catalog .",
    "the 20  cm morphological information is given for each ff source in table 1 .",
    "the 20  cm flux densities listed in table 1 have typical uncertainties of 10% at the 2 mjy level .      improved @xmath0 flux densities were obtained for all objects in table 1 with the addscan utility at ipac .",
    "in addition to the 60  @xmath1 m band used to construct our ff catalog , data at 12  @xmath1 m , 25  @xmath1 m , and 100  @xmath1 m was searched for detections .",
    "almost none of the objects in table 1 were detected at either of the shorter two wavelengths , so no information is included from these wavebands in table 1 .",
    "many detections were obtained in the 100  @xmath1 m data ; these are included where available in table 1 , and one @xmath17 upper limits are indicated in parentheses .",
    "the uncertainty in the typical 60  @xmath1 m measurement in the sample is @xmath46 , and @xmath47 in the 100  @xmath1 m band where detected .",
    "the 60  @xmath1 m and 100  @xmath1 m flux densities were used to calculate the far - infrared luminosity , as defined by sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) : l(40500 @xmath1 m ) @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath49 is the luminosity distance in mpc , @xmath50 $ ] , and @xmath51 . throughout this paper",
    "we use h@xmath52 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "when 100  @xmath1 m detections could not be obtained with addscan , the 1@xmath17 limiting flux densities were used in the calculation of the l@xmath55 .",
    "the l@xmath55 are given in table 1 , and are plotted in figure  [ p20vlfir ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the l@xmath55 is dominated by a combination of the typical @xmath56 flux measurement errors and the @xmath47 uncertainty in the scaling factor c which accounts for the extrapolated flux longward of the 100 @xmath1 m band .",
    "the reliability of the optical identification with the radio source for the objects in table 1 is very high .",
    "the optical / radio source association with the fsc far - infrared source is less certain , because of the relatively large positional uncertainty of the @xmath0 detections .",
    "but there are at least four reasons to believe that the identified optical / radio sources are indeed the fsc sources as well . first , in all cases , the first position is within twice the 1 @xmath17 error ellipse of the fsc source .",
    "second , the optical spectra show emission lines typical of star - forming galaxies , as expected for most far - ir luminous objects .",
    "third , in the cases where both 60 and 100 @xmath1 m detections were obtained , the @xmath0 flux ratios are typical of fir luminous galaxies ( soifer et al .  1987 ) .",
    "finally , in nearly all cases the fir / radio flux ratio lies on the well - established correlation as seen in figure  [ f20v60 ] .",
    "there are at least two possible ways that the wrong association is being made .",
    "first , a galaxy optically brighter than the identified ff source could lie just outside the @xmath0 error ellipse and still be the source of the iras detection .",
    "but in our sample there are no such galaxies which are also detected by first , as would be expected if such objects were the true source of the fir emission .",
    "second , a faint radio source could be missed by the first survey that would coincide with the @xmath57 source . using the rms given in the first catalog for each object ,",
    "lower limits to the resulting @xmath58 ratios for objects beneath the @xmath59 detection limits are found to be @xmath7500 - 700 , far greater than the standard ratio for star - forming galaxies .",
    "finally its worth noting that on average one expects to find only 0.035 first sources within the typical iras error ellipse area , so the probability of a random radio source being associated with an fsc source is low . in our sample of 108",
    "identified ff objects , approximately 4 could be due to radio sources unassociated with the far - ir source .",
    "although we defer the scientific analysis of the new sample to future contributions , we will briefly compare some basic global properties of our ff sample to those of other similarly large samples of high redshift ulig which have been previously published , e.g.  leech et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and clements et al .",
    "our new sample has ulig at higher average redshift ( @xmath60 ) than that of leech et al .",
    "( @xmath61 ) and that of clements et al .",
    "( @xmath62 ) . as for the interaction rate ,",
    "on which there has been some disagreement in the literature ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , our result that 2/3 of the sample shows signs of galaxy interactions is in agreement with leech et al .",
    "but not clements et al . , who found that @xmath63 of their sample were interacting systems . finally , the rate of agn - type optical spectra in our sample , which is only @xmath64 , is somewhat less than the @xmath65 found by clements et al .",
    "we do see a higher incidence of agn - type spectra at the highest l@xmath55 as has been noted previously by several studies ; for a review of this topic see sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have constructed a new survey of ulig using a match of the @xmath0 fsc with the second version of the first catalog , which covered nearly 3000 degrees@xmath18 . by choosing for further study only optically faint matches from the dss which also fall on the radio - fir flux correlation",
    ", we have attempted to find high redshift ulig which are powered primarily by starbursts .",
    "optical images and spectra were obtained of 108 such targets , which were found to lie in the redshift range @xmath66 ; a redshift histogram is shown in figure  [ zhist ] .",
    "nearly all of these targets have @xmath67 greater than @xmath68 , and have a higher average redshift of @xmath69 than in other recent ulig surveys .",
    "near - ir imaging shows that while more than the majority of objects show clear signs of galaxy interactions , nearly 1/3 appear to be normal at arcsec resolution in the @xmath5 band . with this sample ,",
    "we intend to examine the nature of ulig evolution in future contributions .",
    "the authors thank the staff of lick observatory for their help in obtaining the optical data , and bill vacca and dave griep at the irtf for their assistance in obtaining the near - ir data , and for conducting servicing observing for three of the sample objects .",
