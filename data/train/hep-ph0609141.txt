    "the standard model ( sm ) contains and unifies interactions of three different types of elementary particles , with respect to spin : scalars , spin one - half fermions and vector gauge bosons .",
    "the quantum field theory for such types of particles has been successfully constructed and has passed through severe experimental examinations .",
    "almost all phenomenological attempts to extend the sm consist in introducing of a number of new particles of the same type , like extra higgs multiplets , fourth fermion generation and various @xmath0 gauge bosons .",
    "even susy phenomenology does not go further simple doubling of known types of particles .    in this letter",
    "we would like to discuss again the possibility of the presence in nature of new types of spin-1 chiral bosons , which are complementary to the gauge ones .",
    "while the latter transform according to the _ real _ representation ( 1/2,1/2 ) of the lorentz group , transformation properties of the former ones are associated with the _ inequivalent chiral _ representations ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) .",
    "the chiral spin-1 bosons are described by rank - two antisymmetric tensor fields @xmath1 , instead of vector potential @xmath2 , which describes the gauge spin-1 bosons .    on the mass shell",
    "both fields describe spin-1 particles and an equivalence relation between them can be set in the massive case @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of spin-1 particles .",
    "the tensor field describes simultaneously two three - component vector @xmath2 and axial - vector @xmath5 fields .",
    "they can be expressed through six - component tensor field @xmath1 , using the on - shell operator equation @xmath6 , @xmath7 however , many years ago it was noted  @xcite already that different yukawa interactions for different types of spin-1 bosons lead to inequivalent models .",
    "the first successful phenomenological application of this idea has been realized for hadron meson states with spin one  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that _ three different _ quantum numbers @xmath8 of existing spin-1 mesons , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , can not be assigned just to _ two _ vector @xmath12 and axial - vector @xmath13 quark states .",
    "so , the rank - two antisymmetric tensor current @xmath14 was introduced , which also describes vector and axial - vector boson states , but with different transformation properties with respect to lorentz group and with different quantum numbers @xmath9 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "this example demonstrates that both the pure tensor states , @xmath15 bosons , and mixed combinations of vector and tensor states , due to the same quantum numbers , @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons , may exist .",
    "these considerations , in general , support the idea of extension of the sm with a new type of spin-1 chiral particles  @xcite , which has been proposed on pure theoretical grounds , in order to describe the anomalies in the weak charged meson decays .",
    "assuming @xmath18 symmetry of electroweak interactions and that very heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath19 are decoupled at the weak scale , most general yukawa interactions were proposed @xmath20\\left (    \\begin{array}{c } t^+_{mn } \\\\",

    "the fermion sector is the same as in the sm and consists of three generations ( noted by the index @xmath24 ) of the two component weyl spinors @xmath25 : the left - handed lepton @xmath26 and the color quark @xmath27 doublets and the right - handed lepton @xmath28 and the color quark @xmath29 , @xmath30 singlets . here and further on we omit quark color indexes as far as the tensor fields are color blind . the local gauge electroweak symmetry , maintained by the triplet @xmath31@xmath32 and singlet @xmath33 bosons , and @xmath34 color symmetry rest untouched .",
    "it was also argued  @xcite that in order to avoid new chiral anomalies connected with the antisymmetric chiral tensor fields , two higgs doublets with opposite hypercharges should be introduced instead of the one in the sm .",
    "topologically the interactions ( [ y ] ) are the same as the electroweak gauge interactions @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the gauge coupling constants , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the generators of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , correspondingly .",
    "the only principal difference between them concerns fermion chiralities .",
    "while the gauge field interactions preserve the helicities of incoming and outcoming fermions , the tensor field couplings lead to a helicity flip .",
    "this feature should be the main signature in their experimental search .",
    "in this section we will obtain relations among the gauge coupling constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the tensor yukawa couplings @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in order to do this",
    "we will apply hypothesis about dynamical generation of kinetic terms for the bosons .",
    "this idea comes from nambu and jona - lasinio model  @xcite with nonlinear four - fermion interactions .",
    "it has been developed in @xcite for the more appropriate for quantization linear form of interactions , introducing auxiliary boson fields ( without kinetic terms ) with dimensionless yukawa coupling constants  .",
    "let us first apply this method for the gauge fields @xmath31@xmath32 and @xmath33 , assuming that they do not posses initial kinetic terms .",
    "the kinetic terms are generated by self - energy quantum corrections from fermionic loops .",
    "subsequent renormalization procedure leads to proper normalization of the kinetic terms and sets relations among various yukawa coupling constants .",
    "so , in the lowest one - loop approximation the self - energy quantum corrections to the gauge fields @xmath31@xmath32 read @xmath45    \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\hspace{1.2cm}=-4g^2 i_0\\left(g_{mn}q^2-q_m q_n\\right)\\delta^{ij }    + { \\cal o}(q^4),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the regularized value of the logarithmically divergent integral .",
    "analogous calculations for the abelian gauge field @xmath33 give @xmath47    the comparison of the two previous equations leads to a relation between the gauge coupling constants @xmath48 and , hence , to a prediction of the electroweak mixing angle @xmath49 . for a first time",
    "this result was obtained in @xcite .",
    "this value coincides with the prediction of the gut theories ( which include the simple gauge group @xmath50 ) at the unification scale  @xcite . due to the different behavior of the evolution of gauge coupling constants",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 with energy , the renormalization effects lead to a decreasing of @xmath51 at low energies  @xcite , bringing it closer to the experimental value  @xcite @xmath52    a lack of a gauge symmetry for the chiral tensor interactions ( [ y ] ) does not allow to fix the yukawa coupling constants @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . therefore , to go further we must make model dependent assumptions",
    "let us assume lepton - quark universality for the tensor interactions , which are also blind to the generations @xmath53 , @xmath54 .    before proceeding with calculations of self - energy quantum corrections to the tensor fields , it is convenient to rewrite them through the more common notations of the vector potential",
    ". this is possible using extension of the relation ( [ equivalence ] ) off - shell  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "( [ y ] ) takes the form @xmath57    now it is easy to calculate the self - energy quantum corrections to doublets @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 the comparison of ( [ w ] ) , ( [ t ] ) and ( [ u ] ) leads to the relation @xmath62 an asymmetry in the coupling constants for the doublets of the tensor fields arises due to their obviously non - symmetric interactions to the leptons . at high energy scale ,",
    "when the right - handed neutrinos become active , the symmetry between both interactions should be restored .",
    "it may be expected that the evolution of the coupling constants towards low - energy scale should not drastically change the relation ( [ relation ] ) , since both the gauge coupling constant @xmath36 and the yukawa coupling constants @xmath63 and @xmath64 have asymptotically free behavior  @xcite",
    ". we will use this relation below for a quantitative determination of the masses of the chiral particles .",
    "the fermi theory of the weak interaction  @xcite gives excellent example of effective field theory which perfectly describes low - energy physics with only one dimensional coupling constant @xmath65  gev@xmath66 .",
    "it arises from the exchange of the charged massive intermediate bosons @xmath67 at small momentum transfer , which at the tree level is expressed as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the boson mass . in the sm",
    "the gauge coupling constant @xmath70 is related to the electromagnetic fine - structure constant @xmath71 and @xmath51 .",
    "it allows to estimate @xmath72  gev at the tree level with relatively good precision .",
    "therefore , in order to get a constraint on the mass of the new intermediate boson one can analyze the precision low - energy experiments , looking for an eventual admixture of new forces in the ordinary weak processes .",
    "particularly , the chiral bosons can enhance the rates of the chirally suppressed decay modes",
    ".    one may think that @xmath73 decay is the ideal process to put constraints on the presence of new currents chirally different from the sm ones .",
    "however , for the tensor current the hadron matrix element @xmath74 is zero by kinematic reasons , and this decay can restrict only the presence of pseudoscalar currents  @xcite , but not tensor ones .",
    "nevertheless , the quark tensor currents can contribute to the rare three - body pion decay @xmath75 , where huge experimental anomalies have been detected  @xcite .    in order to explain these anomalies ,",
    "the following effective tensor interactions have been derived  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the momentum transfer between quark and lepton pairs and @xmath78 , @xmath79 are dimensionless coupling constants , which determine the strength of the new tensor interactions relative to the ordinary weak interactions .",
    "these interactions arise from the exchange of the charged chiral @xmath80 and @xmath81 bosons at low energies . the first term in ( [ eff ] ) is generated due to the non - diagonal elements of mass mixing matrix  @xcite @xmath82 it can be rewritten identically in a more common form without momentum dependence @xmath83    this local tensor interaction has been considered early in @xmath84 decay phenomenology on the same footing as other local four - fermion interactions . however , to my knowledge , the second non - local term in ( [ eff ] ) has never been used before 1993 . owing to the identity",
    "@xmath85 it is impossible to construct _ local _ tensor interaction with an opposite to ( [ identity ] ) chirality of quark current .",
    "it is worth noting , that the two terms of the tensor interactions ( [ eff ] ) arise as a result of the chiral boson exchanges and should be considered simultaneously .",
    "the requirement of positivity of the determinant @xmath86 of the square mass matrix ( [ mtu ] ) leads to the positive effective coupling constants @xmath87 and the pseudotensor quark currents @xmath88 can completely cancel out in ( [ eff ] ) in the case @xmath89 .",
    "this cancellation helps to avoid another constraint on the tensor interaction ( [ identity ] ) following from the pion decay due to generation of the pseudoscalar quark current @xmath90 through the electromagnetic radiative corrections  @xcite .    in the case of equality of the effective tensor",
    "coupling constants , the diagonalization of the mass matrix ( [ mtu ] ) gives two mass states @xmath91 the maximum value of the lightest mass state is reached at @xmath92 and defines the physical mass @xmath93 , which corresponds to an energetically favored exchange by this particle .",
    "then , the heavy state has a mass @xmath94 .",
    "the centi - weak tensor interaction @xmath95 can explain the deficit of events in the radiative pion decay and , assuming @xmath96 universality , the excess in @xmath97 decay in comparison with cvc prediction  @xcite .",
    "this value of the effective tensor coupling constant allows to predict the masses of the charged chiral bosons @xmath98 which will be used in the next section for quantitative estimations of their production cross - sections .",
    "these physical massive states are represented by two orthogonal combinations @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which correspond to light and heavy massive particles , correspondingly .",
    "their yukawa interactions take the form @xmath101    besides the mixing ( [ mtu ] ) between the charged chiral particles themselves , they can mix with the @xmath102 boson leading to anomalous moment for the charged weak transitions  @xcite .",
    "the first experimental constraints on this parameter have been obtained in @xcite from @xmath103-lepton decays .",
    "the mixings between the gauge and the chiral bosons are in a complete analogy with @xmath104 mixing in hadron physics  @xcite . however , in contrast to the latter , where the mixing is maximal , experimental data point out that the weak mixing is rather small .",
    "let us consider the neutral spin-1 sector of the model . here",
    "besides electroweak bosons @xmath105 and @xmath106 we have introduced _ four _ degrees of freedom @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 for the neutral chiral bosons . due to their quantum numbers @xmath111 and @xmath112 states",
    "do not mix and decouple from the others in the case of @xmath113 invariant interactions .",
    "although @xmath114 and @xmath115 states do not mix between each other , because they couple to the different types @xmath116 and @xmath117 fermions , they can mix with the photon and @xmath106 boson leading to additional contributions to anomalous magnetic and neutral weak moments for the fermions . we will assume , in agreement with the experimental data , that these mixings are very small .",
    "therefore , one can consider these states as physical with the following yukawa interactions @xmath118    in order to estimate the masses of the neutral chiral bosons we can use the mass matrix ( [ mtu ] ) . since the neutral chiral bosons belong to the same multiplets as their charged partners and they do not mix , their masses can be estimated as @xmath119 degeneracies in the masses of @xmath112 , @xmath115 and @xmath111 , @xmath114 states are removed as a result of mixings of @xmath115 and @xmath114 states with the photon and @xmath106 boson , leading to the inequalities @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is a hard task to detect neutral tensor interactions on the background electromagnetic and neutral weak processes in low energy experiments . up to",
    "now there are no positive indications , besides , may be , the deviation in the muon anomalous magnetic moment , which can be assigned to mixings between the photon and the neutral chiral bosons .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show in the next section the chiral bosons have a unique signature for their detection at hadron colliders due to their anomalous couplings with fermions .",
    "the main interest represents the production cross - sections of the lightest chiral bosons . in order to estimate them",
    ", we will calculate basic partial decay widths of the chiral bosons into leptons and quarks .    using the yukawa interactions ( [ yc ] )",
    "we can evaluate the lepton @xmath122 and the quark @xmath123 widths of the charged chiral bosons @xmath124 . assuming the presence of only three fermion generations with masses lighter than @xmath125 we can estimate the total width as @xmath126  gev .",
    "then it is possible to evaluate the production cross - sections at the tevatron   cross section is mainly determined by a valence quark from the proton and an anti - quark from the anti - proton , we neglect here the contribution of the sea quarks . ] @xmath127 and the lhc @xmath128 using , for example , cteq6 m parton distribution functions  @xcite and the appropriated parameter @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the square of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "such a big production cross - sections would immediately contradict to the present tevatron data , unless the chiral bosons have unusual properties .",
    "it is noteworthy , that the lepton width ( [ gl ] ) is suppressed in favor of the quark one ( [ gq ] ) .",
    "hence , the lightest charged chiral particle shows leptophobic property that leads to a reduced lepton production @xmath131 which is the main channel of charged boson detection at hadron colliders .    however , the cross sections ( [ stev_l ] ) are still big to remain undetected at the tevatron .",
    "this fact can be explain by another unusual and unexpected feature of the chiral bosons connected to their anomalous interactions ( [ yva ] ) with fermions .",
    "let us compare the normalized angular distributions of the lepton from the decays of @xmath132 @xmath133 and the @xmath124 @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the boson helicity .",
    "for example , the left - handed quark @xmath136 ( from the proton ) interacting with the right - handed anti - quark @xmath137 ( from the anti - proton ) can produce the @xmath132 with spin projection on the proton beam direction @xmath138 .",
    "hence , the decay leptons are distributed as @xmath139 . while chiral particle production arises from the interaction of a quark and an anti - quark with the same helicities , that leads to zero helicity of the produced chiral boson and @xmath140 lepton distribution  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the cross section for @xmath141 process @xmath142 is expressed through the relevant differential cross section of the parton subprocess @xmath143 @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the mandelstam variables . in the center - of - mass parton system",
    "the differential cross section shows the following distribution @xmath148 here @xmath149 is the angle between the lepton and the parton direction and @xmath150 is the square of the transverse lepton momentum .    since the latter is invariant under longitudinal boosts along the beam direction , the distribution ( [ cos2 ] ) versus @xmath151 holds also in the lab frame @xmath152 .",
    "changing variables in the differential cross section from @xmath153 to @xmath154 @xmath155 leads to a kinematical singularity at the endpoint @xmath156 , which gives the prominent jacobian peak in the @xmath31 decay distribution .",
    "in contrast to this , the pole in the decay distribution of the chiral bosons is cancelled out and , moreover , the distribution reaches zero at the endpoint @xmath156 .",
    "the chiral boson decay distribution has a broad smooth bump with the maximum below the kinematical endpoint , instead of sharp jacobian peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . in the case",
    "when the chiral boson is produced with no transverse momentum , the transverse mass of the lepton pair is related to @xmath157 as @xmath158 and the jacobian peak is absent in @xmath159 distribution as well .",
    "therefore , the decay distribution of the chiral bosons differs drastically from the distribution of the gauge bosons .",
    "even relatively small decay width of the chiral bosons leads to a wide distribution , that obscures their identification as resonances at hadron colliders . at the present time",
    "one can speak only about eventual excess of events in the region @xmath160 gev @xmath161 gev , where the background from the tail of the @xmath31 decays is considerably small . indeed , such excess , although not statistically significant , has been pointed out recently by the cdf collaboraion  @xcite in the same region .",
    "the form of the decay distribution for the chiral bosons resembles the bump anomalies in the inclusive jet @xmath162 distribution , reported by the cdf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that these anomalies could be described by a new neutral leptophobic gauge boson with huge decay width  @xcite .",
    "although this problem has been solved in the framework of the sm by changing the gluon distribution functions  @xcite , it could be reconsidered in the light of the new form of the decay distribution as a real physical signal from decays of different chiral bosons , both charged and neutral .",
    "analysing the bumps in the jet transverse energy distribution in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can find the endpoint of the first bump at 250 gev and guess about the second bump endpoint from the minimum around 350 gev .",
    "if we assign the first bump to the hadron decay products of the lightest charged bosons , which exactly corresponds to the estimated mass from eq .",
    "( [ mhl ] ) , the second endpoint hints to a mass for the lightest neutral boson around 700  gev , which is also in a qualitative agreement with our estimations ( [ m0 ] ) .",
    "however , taking into account the large systematic uncertainties in jet production , these conclusions may be premature .",
    "nevertheless , the lightest neutral chiral bosons @xmath115 and @xmath112 can fairly play the role of the hadrophilic boson , suggested in @xcite in order to explain tevatron and lep anomalies , with nearly the same mass .",
    "indeed , these bosons do not decay into charged leptons and can not be seen in lepton channel . in the best case they have invisible decay widths in neutrinos , if right - handed neutrinos are not too heavy .",
    "however , in contrast to @xcite these bosons are non - gauge bosons , but chiral ones .",
    "there exist also additional neutral chiral bosons @xmath114 and @xmath111 , which couple only to the _ down _ fermions with approximately the same yukawa coupling constants as @xmath115 and @xmath112 bosons .",
    "they influence the low - energy hadron physics two times weaker than the @xmath115 and @xmath112 bosons due to their higher masses .",
    "the production of the heaviest neutral chiral bosons @xmath114 , @xmath111 and the detection of their leptonic decays at the hadron colliders will be crucial test of the discussed model .",
    "unfortunately , due to their big masses they can not be produced at the tevatron at present .",
    "let us calculate their lepton and quark widths in order to estimate their production cross - section at the lhc .    using the yukawa interactions ( [ yn ] ) we obtain the following decay widths @xmath163 for the lepton and @xmath164 for the quark channels .",
    "this gives @xmath165  gev for the total fermion decay width .",
    "since the lepton branching ratio @xmath166 is not negligible one expects essential signal in the dilepton channels with a cross section @xmath167    the most conclusive experimental evidence for the presence of anomalous interactions and new type of spin-1 non - gauge bosons will be the detection of wide bumps in leptonic distribution at high @xmath157 at tevatron and lhc and the dilepton production with high invariant mass around 1 tev . considering @xmath168 and @xmath169 channels for the decays of the lightest charged chiral bosons , one may expect around 1 event per day at tevatron ( average luminosity @xmath170 cm@xmath66s@xmath172 ) and around 1 event every 5 seconds at lhc ( designed peak @xmath173 cm@xmath66s@xmath172 ) .",
    "taking into account also that in @xmath174-annihilation two different species of the neutral chiral bosons @xmath114 and @xmath111 are produced with approximately the same masses , one may expect one electron or muon pair with invariant mass around 1  tev every 25 second at lhc peak luminosity .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to note that our numerical results essentially depend on the magnitude of the low - energy effective tensor coupling constant @xmath78 . according to our estimations",
    "@xcite its value can be up to 30% larger , which effectively decreases all the calculated masses of the chiral bosons by 15% . however , the mass ratios of the chiral bosons @xmath175 are fixed by the model .",
    "really , the masses of the charged @xmath176 , @xmath177 and neutral @xmath115 , @xmath114 chiral bosons can get an additional positive contributions due to the small mixings between the gauge and the chiral bosons , which have been neglected here",
    ".    taking into account the unusual lepton distribution ( [ cos2 ] ) , the main attention should be paid to events with large pseudorapidities , where the dominant lepton production occurs as a result of decays of the new chiral particles . to support these qualitative statements and to be ready to meet eventual new physics ,",
    "detailed quantative calculations should be fulfilled on the basis of the interactions ( [ yc ] ) and ( [ yn ] ) , taking into account also all possible known effects and specifics of concrete detector .",
