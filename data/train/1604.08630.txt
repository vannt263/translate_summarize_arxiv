    "nodal semimetals are systems of arbitrary dimensionality for which the valence and conduction bands meet and form nodes in a limited set of places in the brillouin zone .",
    "the existence of nodal points at the fermi energy has implications for bulk transport , surface physics , and is even related to topology  @xcite . since the discovery of nodal points with linear dispersion in single - sheet graphene  @xcite , there has been great effort to locate and characterize similar band - touching nodes in other systems .",
    "rich nodal physics can also be found in graphene bilayers , however these systems have quadratically - dispersing nodes , and thus differing transport properties and gapped phases  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this search for graphene - like physics can be considered more specifically a search for systems with _ linearly - dispersing _ nodal points at the fermi energy .    extending this search to three dimensions ,",
    "there are generically two realizations of this nodal physics : point nodes and nodal lines .",
    "bands can meet at nodes with linear dispersion in three directions and form dirac or weyl points , with four- and two - fold nodal degeneracies respectively  @xcite , or in unusual three- , six- , and eight - fold degeneracies  @xcite .",
    "bands can also meet and form line nodes , or lines along which there is no dispersion in one direction and linear dispersion in the remaining two directions  @xcite .",
    "each of these examples of nodal phenomena owes its protection to some combination of topology and exact crystalline symmetries .",
    "however , many of them have been described in terms of individual properties , such as topological invariants and symmetry eigenvalues . in this manuscript",
    ", we seek to provide a more generalized consideration of those nodal systems protected by crystalline symmetries , as well as a means to sort and classify them .      as a starting point for sorting these various nodal materials",
    ", one could ask whether or not any of their nodal features can be eliminated to open a gap .",
    "consider the ability to remove point nodes pairwise , or to shrink and gap line nodes at a point , while still preserving a system s crystalline symmetries .",
    "the dirac points in cd@xmath0as@xmath1 and na@xmath0bi , as well as the line nodes proposed in cu@xmath0n and observed in ca@xmath0p@xmath1  @xcite , obey this property , whereas the proposed dirac points in bio@xmath1 and the dirac line nodes in sriro@xmath0 do not  @xcite .",
    "we can designate this first category of nodal systems as _ band - inversion _ semimetals .",
    "the nodes in these systems are optional features of the space group ; they are certainly locally permitted by crystalline symmetries , or topology in the case of dirac line nodes under weak spin - orbit interaction , but they are otherwise globally extraneous .",
    "conversely , the nodes in bio@xmath1 and sriro@xmath0 are part of groupings of 4 and 8 bands , respectively .",
    "all of the bands in these systems appear at a minimum in groupings of these numbers , and the existence of nodal features at the fermi energy appears to be guaranteed by the electron filling . we therefore designate these as _ essential _ semimetals , or systems with nodes which are pinned into existence by additional space - group - specific symmetries .",
    "this relationship between essential nodal features and filling is , as discussed in this manuscript , the single - particle manifestation of the concept of `` minimal insulating filling . ''",
    "watanabe , po , vishwanath , and zaletel ( wpvz ) realized that for 220 of the 230 space groups , a discussion of related flat compact manifolds allows one to exclude the existence of an insulating state at fillings specific to each space group  @xcite .",
    "note that this criterion only addresses the allowed existence of a consistent band gap for systems in which all bands are either fully occupied or unoccupied .",
    "it does not exclude cases where the dispersion is large and the fermi energy cuts through electron and hole pockets .",
    "nevertheless , for the purposes of this manuscript , we will still refer to such indirect gap materials as insulators , as many of the analysis methods for such systems , such as polarization and topological invariant calculations , only require the ability to find well - separated band groupings .    in this manuscript",
    ", we designate the integer fillings at which wpvz deduced an allowed insulating state as the `` wpvz bound . '' in the limit that interactions are weak and bands are well - defined , we observe that _ the same combinations of crystalline symmetries which define the wpvz bound also conspire to guarantee essential groupings of bands .",
    "_ furthermore , in cases where local topological features might be removed to open a gap , such as the combination of two weyl points with opposite chern numbers  @xcite , this bound provides an obstruction to that process .",
    "for example , if two weyl points are required to exist by minimal insulating filling , they can not be gapped out while preserving all crystalline symmetries , even if they have opposite chern numbers , as the bands which comprise them can not be separated without lowering the system symmetry and changing the space - group - specific filling constraints .    in practice , the determination of this bound , as well as the accompanying analysis of crystalline symmetry algebra , can become difficult in three dimensions . noting that young and kane also predicted essential semimetallic features in two - dimensions  @xcite",
    ", we therefore propose a consideration of the wpvz bound and the allowed nodal features in two dimensions .",
    "furthermore , to restrict our discussion to the role of crystalline symmetries , we require strong spin - orbit interaction , such that locally - protected topological features , such as the dirac points in graphene , are disallowed . in this paper , we observe that , considering the full set of 80 two - dimensional systems known as the `` layer groups ''  @xcite , nontrivial wpvz bounds can be achieved and rich nodal semimetallic phenomena can be both created in _ band - inversion _ semimetals and required in _ essential _ semimetals .",
    "some of these phenomena are protected by the same mechanisms as are their three - dimensional cousins that occur in such materials as bio@xmath1 and sriro@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we show how this analysis predicts previously uncharacterized nodal phenomena in two- and three - dimensions , such as band - inversion dirac points protected by an inversion - center offset and an essential 8-band `` cat s cradle '' weyl fermion feature .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , in  [ sec : platycosms ] we use a discussion of compact flat manifolds to rederive the wpvz bound in first purely two - dimensional systems ( wallpaper groups ) and then in two - dimensional systems embedded in three dimensions ( layer groups ) . following that",
    ", we provide in  [ sec : eigenvals ] a breakdown of the eigenvalue structure of band groupings as it relates to spatial symmetries and inversion centers . finally , in  [ sec : lgs ] we combine both descriptions to produce criteria for predicting semimetallic features and apply them to a set of related simple models characteristic of both band - inversion and essential nodal semimetallic features in two - dimensional crystals with strong spin - orbit interaction .",

    "this discussion is intended as an introduction to topics in topology and group theory such as compact manifolds and group modding procedures . at the level of this manuscript",
    ", we loosely equate such concepts as flatness , uniformity , and the absence of fixed points . for a more formal treatment of this material , we recommend that one consult conway and rossetti  @xcite .      for",
    "a 2d system periodic in one of the in - plane directions , say a piece of paper wrapped onto itself , there are two ways to assign boundary conditions . linking the two opposite sides without any twists",
    "produces a cylinder , and twisting the paper once produces the familiar mbius strip . we can also consider a 2d object with periodicity in both of the in - plane directions .",
    "visually , one can assign boundary conditions for such an object by considering the orientation of arrows on the fundamental polygon ( fig .",
    "[ figwallpoly ] ) .",
    "the three distinct combinations of arrow assignments for a two - dimensional system with two periodic directions give a 2-torus , a klein bottle , and the real projective plane ( @xmath4 ) . keeping the arrow assignments consistent relative to the left - hand side of the polygon",
    ", one could produce a pattern like the one on a 2-torus ( fig .",
    "[ figwallpoly](a ) ) by linking together _ twice _ a klein bottle ( fig .",
    "[ figwallpoly](b ) ) or _ four times _ @xmath4 ( fig .  [ figwallpoly](c ) ) .",
    "the creation of such a supercell from the various manifolds is visually depicted in appendix  [ appendix : manifolds ] .",
    "these manifolds can accommodate the set of truly two - dimensional systems , that is , systems comprised of two - dimensional objects embedded in a two - dimensional space .",
    "some of these manifolds permit the embedding of a subset of systems known as the _ wallpaper groups _  @xcite .",
    "when considered in three dimensions , the wallpaper groups consist of the 17 unique combinations of symmetries which could describe the two - dimensional boundary of a three - dimensional object .",
    "they are therefore characterized only by symmetry operations which preserve the interior and exterior of such a boundary , namely mirror and glide lines in the plane and rotations of the surface about its normal vector .",
    "for this reason , the operation of an arrow flip could also be considered the modding out of a glide mirror , as a site on the left side of a _ flipped _",
    "boundary is related to a site on the right side by a glide mirror operation .",
    "modding out a single glide produces the klein bottle ( fig .",
    "[ figwallpoly](b ) ) : a two - dimensional manifold that has just one surface ( also sometimes called nonorientable as its surface does not preserve the handedness of a coordinate axis which traverses it )  @xcite .",
    "this object is compact , as it was constructed periodically , and but it is also flat . modding out an additional glide produces the one - sided real projective plane ( @xmath4 ) ( fig .",
    "[ figwallpoly](c ) ) , which unlike the 2-torus and the klein bottle has fixed points , and is therefore not flat and uniform .",
    "one can test for these fixed or special points in two dimensions by considering the circumference of a circle of radius @xmath2 centered throughout the manifold . in the center of all three two - dimensional manifolds ,",
    "this circle has circumference @xmath3 .",
    "the only possible deviations from this value can occur at the boundaries of the manifolds , as depicted by the dashed lines in figure  [ figwallpoly ] .",
    "for the 2-torus and the klein bottle , the boundary of a circle of radius @xmath2 centered at the bottom left corner still explores all three other corners before returning , resulting in a circumference of @xmath3 , a value that matches circles on the interior .",
    "however , for @xmath4 , the boundary returns to itself after only reaching the top right corner , giving a circumference of just @xmath5 , and indicating that the two bottom corners are special points , different from each other and from the interior .",
    "a key restriction of wpvz s argument is that any manifold for consideration must allow the uniform embedding of a crystal lattice such that the bloch wave functions are periodic plane waves  @xcite .",
    "the special corners in @xmath4 violate this uniformity , and therefore modding out onto it is disallowed .",
    "we therefore conclude that _ the wallpaper groups can only be uniformly embedded on the 2-torus and on the klein bottle . _    more formally , we can consider this restriction to fixed - point - free manifolds in terms of group theory .",
    "wpvz take advantage of work by bieberbach that established that a collection of 10 space groups are fixed - point free .",
    "these space groups each have only one nonsymmorphic symmetry , or have a very special combination of two perpendicular nonsymmorphic symmetries such that no fixed points are introduced .",
    "we note that for just one of these 10 space groups , there is a corresponding wallpaper group .",
    "this wallpaper group , @xmath6 ( space group 7 @xmath7 ) , is characterized just by a single glide symmetry .",
    "the process of modding out a glide and flipping an arrow on the fundamental polygon is more formally asking whether or not @xmath6 is a subgroup of that wallpaper group , such that it can be modded out .",
    "as @xmath6 only contains one glide , modding by it results in a placement onto the klein bottle , and as none of the remaining nonsymmorphic wallpaper groups correspond to fixed - point - free space groups when stacked in three dimensions , the klein bottle is the _ only _ manifold besides the 2-torus which is compatible with the embedding of a purely two - dimensional crystal lattice .",
    "finally , as only nonsymmorphic operations can provide a coordinate - arrow twist of the fundamental polygon , and as all of the nonsymmorphic wallpaper groups describe rectangular lattices , we therefore find that _ all _ possible restrictions on the uniform embeddings of 2d lattices can be obtained by considering whether or not axis boundary condition flips on the fundamental polygon introduce fixed points .     by the additional local assignment of the stacking direction",
    "as indicated by the @xmath8 and @xmath9 signs . unlike in the strictly two - dimensional wallpaper systems , the modding out of a two - fold screw is also allowed and leads to a new manifold which does nt decompose into @xmath10 multiplied by a wallpaper manifold .",
    "modding out a screw preserves the interior and exterior surfaces leading to the dicosm ( b ) . modding out a glide",
    "reduces the system to being one - sided and leads to the 1st amphicosm ( c ) . in these layered systems , unlike in the 2d wallpaper cases , a particular combination of two perpendicular nonsymmorphic operations can be modded out without introducing fixed points , leading to a new flat manifold : the 1st amphidicosm ( d ) .",
    "the bold numbers indicate the number of times that each pattern would have to be repeated to create a supercell with the same boundary conditions as the initial 3-torus ( a ) . the procedure for forming such supercells",
    "is explained with visuals in appendix  [ appendix : manifolds].,width=336 ]    in three - dimensions , this argument can be extended , though unfortunately in general there is no neat analogue to the fundamental polygon to describe the equivalent operations of modding out glide mirrors or screws .",
    "the 10 resultant three - dimensional flat manifolds are known as the platycosms .",
    "descriptions of them , as well as , where possible , connections to more familiar manifolds , are detailed in plain language in ref .  .",
    "however , for 80 realizations of 70 three - dimensional space groups , crystals can be decomposed into two - dimensional sheets , only related to the next layer by lattice periodicity in the stacking direction . for these layered systems ,",
    "symmetry - enforced physics is entirely determined by the symmetries of a two - dimensional single layer , and therefore even though they are three - dimensional systems , many of their properties can be determined by confining analysis to the two - dimensional subsystem of a single layer .",
    "these single - layer systems , comprised of two - dimensional objects embedded in three dimensions , are a subset of `` subperiodic groups '' known as the _ layer groups _",
    "@xcite .    for these layer group systems , placement onto a platycosm can be visually represented by modifying the fundamental polygon to include a local specification of the @xmath11 direction ( stacking direction ) ( fig .",
    "[ figlayerpoly ] ) . for these systems",
    "the modding out of a two - fold screw is now also permitted in addition to the glide mirror mod , with the screw mod taking one to the two - sided dicosm ( fig .",
    "[ figlayerpoly](b ) ) and the glide mod taking one to the one - sided 1st amphicosm ( fig .  [ figlayerpoly](c ) ) ( which can also be expressed as @xmath12 )  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the modding out of a glide which flips the @xmath11 direction as well as a perpendicular screw results in a manifold which , unlike @xmath4 in the fully - two - dimensional wallpaper systems , is flat .",
    "this manifold , the 1st amphidicosm ( fig .  [ figlayerpoly](d ) ) , actually needs to be placed _",
    "four _ times to reorient the system boundary to match the torus configuration of the modified fundamental polygon , a property which will have significant band - structure implications .",
    "visual representations of this comparison of the twisted manifolds with the initial torus can be found in appendix  [ appendix : manifolds ] .      in ref .  , the authors combined an understanding of the platycosms with kramers theorem to make a strong statement about space - group - symmetry - enforced obstructions to insulators occurring at specific fillings . in the following text , we reproduce their arguments and then apply them to the restricted set of layer group systems .",
    "for any real system with spinful electrons , there exists a time - reversal operator @xmath13 which squares to @xmath14 and mandates , according to kramers theorem , that each state is two - fold - degenerate . under this restriction , a periodic crystal with an odd number of electrons @xmath15 must , independent of how its boundary conditions are applied ,",
    "have a partially filled state and therefore be a metal or a semimetal  @xcite .",
    "that number of electrons can be expressed as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the number of unit cells and @xmath18 is the filling per unit cell .",
    "therefore , kramers theorem can be restated as a requirement that @xmath19 to avoid a metallic state .",

    "all of the information about this system can be encoded by mandating that both sublattices live at the same potential and by replacing each site with a vector object pointing in the @xmath21 direction ( a ) .",
    "when the system has an even number of sites and the boundary condition is not twisted , it lives on a cylinder ( b ) .",
    "however , one can produce an electronically equivalent system , if the number of unit cells is large , by removing one site and twisting the axis boundary condition on the @xmath22 direction , which places the lattice instead on a mbius strip.,width=336 ]    now , when the unit cell is constructed of energetically identical sites related by some spatial operation , one can consider the operation which takes you between sites as a nonsymmorphic symmetry : a combination of a fractional lattice translation and a spatial operation .",
    "the quintessential example of a system with such a symmetry is the undimerized su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model , which is a one - dimensional bipartite chain where the sites can be equivalently represented by a local up or down vector object ( fig .  [ figssh](a ) ) .",
    "while the gapped phases of this model already have a symmorphic mirror symmetry in the @xmath20 direction , its quantum critical point , reached by enforcing the same chemical potential on each sublattice , possess a second , _ nonsymmorphic _ symmetry , one which relates the two sublattices by a mirror of the @xmath22 direction and a half - lattice translation in the @xmath20 direction .    in this limit of the ssh model",
    ", one could consider taking the final unit cell before the boundary and eliminating one of the sites .",
    "this new system with a decimated unit cell , if sufficiently large , will still be electronically equivalent to the original system as long as the boundary condition reproduces the nonsymmorphic symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ figssh](b ) )  @xcite",
    ". however , the resultant crystal now has a fractional @xmath17 ( here a half integer ) , and therefore in this crystal , assembled with this boundary condition , kramers theorem actually requires that @xmath23 to avoid a metallic state .",
    "stated differently , _ four - band models of this ssh model tuned to have a nonsymmorphic symmetry are obstructed from being bulk insulators at half filling_. one can consider the ssh quantum critical point as a manifestation of that obstruction .    in systems with more than one periodic direction , there can be multiple nonsymmorphic symmetries to consider .",
    "the process of decimating the final unit cell and twisting the axis boundary condition to reproduce the nonsymmorphic symmetries is in fact just a reproduction of the modding process used to generate the manifolds in section  [ sec : polygons ] . in 1d",
    "( with two - dimensional sites ) with this ssh model , the decimation process reduces the underlying manifold from a cylinder to a mbius strip  @xcite . in two and",
    "layered three dimensions , this decimation process exactly corresponds to placing the lattice onto one of the manifolds in figures  [ figwallpoly ] and  [ figlayerpoly ] respectively . with multiple nonsymmorphic symmetries , _",
    "the condition for flatness is a simple check in these systems whether the product of the two symmetry operations modded out , as defined from a common origin , is itself also an inherently nonsymmorphic operation . _",
    "the prefactor on the integer filling to avoid a metallic state exactly corresponds to the degree of decimation of the final unit cell , expressed as the large bold numbers in figures  [ figwallpoly ] and  [ figlayerpoly ] . for reference ,",
    "visual representations of this decimation process for two - dimensional lattices can be found in appendix  [ appendix : manifolds ] .    in the limit that interactions are weak and bands",
    "are well defined , _ this minimum filling corresponds to the minimum number of bands which must be tangled together , independent of any band - tuning conditions_. these essential tangles of bands are bounded by two- and four - fold degeneracies that can only be moved , but not gapped , by tuning space - group - allowed hopping terms .",
    "any band crossings on lines between these degeneracies are therefore also stuck in existence , and are also only capable of movement but not gapping . throughout this manuscript",
    ", we will relate these groupings of bands to the particular wpvz bounds for minimal insulating filling established by combining the platycosm modding procedure with kramers theorem .",
    "finally , wpvz noted that in three dimensions , there are a handful of exceptions to the platycosm formulation of minimal insulating filling established by these arguments , with breakdowns occurring in some cases of multiple nonsymmorphic symmetries or because of unusual , highly degenerate points  @xcite .",
    "however , none of these exceptions occur in the 80 layer groups , and therefore the platycosm formulation of the wpvz bound in these systems exactly captures the filling restrictions imposed by nonsymmorphic symmetries .    in appendix  [",
    "appendix : fillingcond ] , we list all of the layer groups as well as their corresponding space groups , allowed manifold placements , and insulating filling restrictions .",
    "in the band theory limit , the arguments made by wpvz must still be consistent with any symmetry- or topology - related mechanism for the protection of nodal features . in three - dimensional systems with strong spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "nodes such as weyl points can be locally protected by a topological invariant  @xcite . however , in two dimensions with strong spin - orbit interaction , or in three - dimensional systems with a higher symmetry , the protection of nodal features is determined instead by the local symmetry eigenvalue structure of the bands . in particular , to protect a node in strong spin - orbit systems in two dimensions , the bands which cross must not share the same symmetry eigenvalues of all simultaneously compatible ( _ i.e. _ commuting ) symmetry operations , or in general they will anticross and form a gap .",
    "the set of protected degeneracies in the layer groups with strong spin - orbit interaction , including both essential- and band - inversion - type nodes , is therefore entirely determined by the kinds of allowed band multiplicities and eigenvalue structures . in this section ,",
    "we review basics regarding the treatment of symmetry operators in @xmath24-space , working up to how two - fold symmetries can provide more exotic degeneracies and eigenvalue pairings .    in @xmath24-space",

    ", only the combination of @xmath26 and @xmath13 can be a symmetry . if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 enforces kramers theorem for each value of @xmath24 such that bands everywhere are two - fold - degenerate .",
    "other symmetries are valid along points , lines , and planes and can also lead to two- or even four - fold band multiplets . in this section",
    ", we examine the examples of band multiplicity and symmetry eigenvalue character which can locally protect a band crossing in layer group systems .",
    "we start at the time - reversal - invariant momenta and reduce symmetry from there to lines and planes .",
    "we close with a discussion of symmetry eigenvalues , working up from singly - degenerate bands to eigenvalue structures in band multiplets .      at a time - reversal - invariant crystal momentum ( trim ) , the layer groups will host symmetry - required degeneracies of 2 or 4 bands for systems with time - reversal - symmetry @xmath13 .",
    "kramers theorem requires that under @xmath27 , states at the trims are two - fold - degenerate .",
    "additionally , should @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an arbitrary symmetry operation valid at that particular trim , the hamiltonian must have a degeneracy of at least 4 .",
    "a common example of this relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath30 occurs with two - fold symmetries , for which _ if two spatial operations have representations which commute with time - reversal and anticommute with each other , and at least one of them squares to @xmath31 , then states at that trim will be 4-fold - degenerate_. four - fold degeneracies can also occur at points owing to the relationship between a spatial symmetry and a rotation of order @xmath32  @xcite , but in the layer groups , these systems are unable to host many of the _ essential nonsymmorphic",

    "for a half translation , the eigenvalues wind with a @xmath52 periodicity , which dictates that the @xmath53 and @xmath54 eigenstates of a glide or a two - fold screw have to connect somewhere along the translation direction and resolve this discrepancy .",
    "in fact , this implies that the choice of designating a band as a @xmath53 or @xmath54 eigenstate away from @xmath51 is a gauge choice , as the eigenvalues can not be defined continuously and with period @xmath25 .",

    "the story regarding this band structure is a bit more involved .",
    "we find that there are three criteria which must all be met to guarantee the existence of an essential eight - band tangle in an orthorhombic system with inversion symmetry .",

    "determining this degeneracy can either be accomplished by considering at those trims the algebra between _ all _ of the independent space group generators , or by consulting a crystalline symmetry textbook such as bradley and cracknell  @xcite . finally , and most importantly , to prove that an odd number of dirac crossings _ must _ exist along the high - symmetry line",
    ", one must additionally show that the four - fold - degenerate bands at the bounding trims support a particular algebra . specifically , at the trim where the nonsymmorphic operation which is offset from the inversion center squares to @xmath31 , _ that symmetry must commute with all other independent operations which generate the space group and are valid at that trim .",
    "_ if this final criterion is met , then the nonsymmorphic operation must have at that point , here @xmath61 , a @xmath81 representation proportional to the identity and therefore eigenvalues @xmath151 or @xmath152 .",
    "as at the other bounding trim where the nonsymmorphic operation squares to @xmath14 , here @xmath60 , time - reversal requires that the imaginary nonsymmorphic eigenvalues be paired @xmath107 , doubly - degenerate bands must cross an odd number of times between the two bounding trims and form at least one _ essential _",

    "while more involved than the wpvz bound method for determining if groups of eight bands have to be tangled together in a system with inversion symmetry , this consideration of symmetry eigenvalues and commutation relations is beneficial when dealing with three - dimensional space groups for which the platycosm formulation of the wpvz bound breaks down .",
    "for example , in systems where high - fold rotation leads to an eight - fold double dirac point , the wpvz bound calculated through a consideration of flat manifold placement only seems to capture the particular 8-band dirac feature seen in layer group 45 . while the platycosm formulation of the wpvz bound states that space group 130 has a minimal insulating filling of @xmath156 and space group 135 a minimal insulating filling of @xmath55 , both crystal systems are very similar in practice and both in practice host essential double dirac points  @xcite .",
