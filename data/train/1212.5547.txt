    "word - of - mouth phenomena often catapult books , movies , and music out of obscurity and into popularity .",
    "similar propagative effects are observed in voting behavior , the spread of rumors , and diffusion of innovations .",
    "several models for describing such information cascades have been proposed in social science @xcite . in the context of network science , watts proposed a network model ( the linear threshold model @xcite on a network ) , in which the decision made by each node ( person ) to adopt an innovation is determined by the relative number of its adjacent nodes ( friends ) who have already adopted it @xcite . as the decision threshold is lowered , the model transits from the local cascade phase , where cascades are constrained , to the global cascade phase , where some small initial shocks are propagated through the whole system .",
    "this transition is discontinuous ; the final fraction of adopters rises discontinuously , and its distribution over many trials is bimodal even at the transition threshold . following the seminal paper by watts ,",
    "several authors have investigated the effects of network topology on the transition threshold  @xcite .",
    "the linear threshold model assumes _ permanently active _ nodes ; that is , a node that has adopted an innovation will retain that innovation . on the other hand , the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model @xcite and the independent cascade ( ic ) model @xcite ( including the sir model with transmissibility @xcite ) have been investigated as models of _ transient fads_. in the ic model , a fad adopter abandons the fad after a single attempt , with a certain probability , to transmit the fad to each susceptible neighbor .",
    "the sir and ic models on complex networks have been extensively studied both analytically and numerically @xcite . on networks ,",
    "the transition of these models is not discontinuous but continuous .",
    "several complex contagion models have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "even transient fads may undergo discontinuous transition if more than one state is available to each node before adoption . incorporating _ social reinforcement _ into the sir model , krapivsky et al . developed an agent - based model of transient fads , which we call the fad model @xcite . here",
    ", social reinforcement means that each node adopts a fad only after multiple prompts from adjacent adopters . in this model ,",
    "a node takes one of the @xmath4 awareness levels @xmath5 , @xmath6 : nodes with the awareness level less than @xmath7 remain susceptible , and nodes with the highest awareness level @xmath7 adopt the fad .",
    "each adopter increases the awareness level of its adjacent neighbors by one at a unit rate .",
    "adopters also abandon the fad at a certain rate . in the absence of reinforcement ( @xmath8 )",
    ", the model reduces to an ordinary sir model .",
    "krapivsky et al .",
    "studied this model without a spatial structure by the macroscopic rate equations @xcite .",
    "they showed that the transition is continuous for @xmath9 and discontinuous for @xmath10 .",
    "however , the behavior of this agent - based model on a network remains unknown .    in this study",
    ", we analytically investigate the effect of social reinforcement on transient fads in networked systems . to this end",
    ", we propose a simple multistage independent cascade ( mic ) model , a multistage version of the ic model .",
    "the present mic model is a discrete time fad model of @xmath11 .",
    "provided that the underlying network is locally treelike , the tree approximation is applicable to this model . here",
    ", we formulate the tree approximation for uncorrelated networks of arbitrary degree distribution @xmath2 . as an application ,",
    "we study this model on a random regular network of degree @xmath12 , random graphs , and scale - free networks , to show that the present model actually exhibits a discontinuous jump of the number of abandoners .",
    "we also investigate the percolation transitions in networks of susceptible nodes and abandoners .",
    "interestingly , when the fraction of initial adopters is finite , the number of abandoners can discontinuously jump after the abandoner s network has percolated .",
    "overall , the phase diagram of the mic model crucially depends on the fraction of initial fad adopters .    , and @xmath13 ) occur at nodes adjacent to an adopter the event indicated by the solid line ( @xmath14 ) occurs irrespective of the neighbor s state . , width=151 ]",
    "consider a network of @xmath15 nodes . in our mic model ,",
    "each node takes one of the four states : ( 0 ) susceptible and unaware , ( 1 ) informed ( susceptible and aware ) , ( 2 ) fad adopter , and ( 3 ) fad abandoner .",
    "the model dynamics is given as follows ( figure  [ rule ] ) :    * randomly select a fraction @xmath16 of nodes as the initial fad adopters ( _ seeds _ ) . set the state of other nodes to susceptible .",
    "* compile a ( randomly ordered ) list @xmath17 of adopters .",
    "for each adopter ( 2 ) in @xmath17 , compile a list @xmath18 of the neighboring susceptible nodes ( 0 or 1 ) .",
    "for each node in @xmath18 , execute the following process : ( ii - a ) if the node is susceptible and unaware ( 0 ) , change it to either informed ( @xmath19 ) with probability @xmath0 , fad adopter ( @xmath20 ) with probability @xmath1 , or leave unchanged otherwise .",
    "( ii - b ) if the node is informed ( 1 ) , change it to fad adopter ( @xmath13 ) with probability @xmath21 , or leave unchanged . at this stage , the new adopters are not yet included in @xmath17 .",
    "* change all adopters in @xmath17 to abandoners ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "* repeat ( ii ) and ( iii ) until no adopter exists in the network .",
    "note that when @xmath22 , the model reduces to the ic model ( the sir model with transmissibility @xmath1 ) .    in the following sections , we denote the final state fraction of nodes in states 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we also designate the networks of susceptible nodes and abandoners as the @xmath23-network and @xmath26-network , respectively .",
    "the fractions of the largest components of the @xmath23- and @xmath26-networks are , respectively , denoted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in this section , we consider the dynamics starting from an infinitesimal fraction of seeds ( @xmath30 ) on uncorrelated networks with a given degree distribution @xmath2 ( for example , a random regular network , erds  rnyi random graph  @xcite , or a scale - free network ( sfn ) generated by using the configuration model  @xcite ) .",
    "newman analyzed the sir model with transmissibility @xmath31 ( the present model with @xmath22 and @xmath32 ) using generating functions @xcite .",
    "he reported two phase transitions as @xmath31 is increased : a giant component of abandoners appears at the percolation threshold of the @xmath26-network @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 denotes the average of a quantity weighted by @xmath2 ) , and a giant component of susceptible nodes disappears at the percolation threshold of the @xmath23-network @xmath35 .",
    "correspondingly , there exist three distinct phases : @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and @xmath40 for @xmath43 . in the following ,",
    "we generalize his method in order to apply it to the present model .",
    "we investigate the phase diagram of percolation ( of the @xmath23- and @xmath26-networks ) , and therefore focus on the final state of the dynamics , where no adopters exist . consider a randomly chosen ( rc ) node and its rc neighbor . here",
    "we assume that the focal rc node was still susceptible or informed when the rc neighbor became an adopter ( if such a neighbor exists ) .",
    "we denote the probability that the prompt of this rc neighbor did not change the state of the focal node by @xmath44 , and the probability that the rc neighbor is susceptible or informed by @xmath45 in the final state .",
    "then @xmath44 and @xmath45 are related as @xmath46 the first term @xmath45 on the right - hand side of the first equality signifies that the rc neighbor did not adopt the fad and that no transmission occurred from this rc neighbor to the focal node .",
    "the second term @xmath47 is the probability that the rc neighbor abandons the fad , but has never altered the state of the focal node while adopting the fad .",
    "we can evaluate the fractions of each state , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 , by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "to this end , it is convenient to introduce the generating function of the degree distribution @xmath2 and the excess degree distribution @xmath48 : @xmath49 here , @xmath48 is the probability that an endpoint of an edge ( an rc neighbor of an rc node ) has excess degree @xmath50 , i.e. , the number of neighbors minus one is @xmath50 . in uncorrelated networks , @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 . because the probability that an rc node with degree @xmath50 is susceptible is @xmath53 , the fraction of susceptible nodes @xmath23 , which is equal to the probability that an rc node is susceptible , is @xmath54 a node with degree @xmath50 remained informed if it received information from just one of the adopters among its @xmath50 neighbors and it did not receive any information from other neighbors .",
