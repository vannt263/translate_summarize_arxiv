    "observations show that the two point correlation function of the galaxies is an approximate power law over a range of scales .",
    "this result , known for decades now , defies a simple  first - principle \" explanation because of the complexity of the physical processes involved . in the conventional big - bang cosmology",
    "the dominant contribution to the energy density of the universe is in the form of nonbaryonic dark matter and the visible galaxies ( made of baryons ) form due to complex processes of cooling and fragmentation within the dark matter halos .",
    "it is possible to model non linear gravitational clustering of _ dark matter halos _ by a scaling ansatz ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) and show that a power law correlation is expected ( in a spatial and temporal interval ) for scale invariant initial conditions .",
    "this result arises from the fact that newtonian gravitational dynamics in a @xmath1 universe does not have any preferred scale which is of interest to cosmology . but to translate this result to baryonic structures is not easy and at present the only explanation for the power law correlation of galaxies arises from numerical simulations .",
    "there are , however , alternate ( and less popular ) models for galaxy formation in quasi - steady state cosmology ( qssc ) in which the process is addressed without invoking gravitational instability explicitly @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed , based on numerical simulations , that these models also lead to power law correlation function for galaxy distribution .",
    "this result is of intrinsic interest even to conventional cosmologists  who may not accept the alternate model  because it provides a scenario to probe the relationship between ( i ) the conventional scenario of galaxy formation via gravitational instability ( accepted by most of the working cosmologists ) and ( ii ) the power law correlation function for the galaxies .",
    "if a completely different model can lead to power law correlation function , then it is clear that observations of galaxy correlation function , by itself , can not be used as a discriminator between the theories .",
    "since the `` rule '' used for creating galaxies in qssc is simple and explicit , it is indeed possible to study this process completely analytically .",
    "we provide such an analysis in this paper and show that the model is intrinsically unstable .",
    "however , the galaxies produced by this rule _ will _ exhibit a power law correlation function for a range of intermediate time scales .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section",
    ", we provide an analytic description of the model for galaxy formation in the qssc , which was used in @xcite .",
    "this is done in terms of discrete time steps to parallel the previous work . in section 3",
    "we discuss the continuum limit of this model that lends itself to a completely tractable analysis . in section 4",
    "we describe a very general class of processes which obey the same equations as described here and a broader class of applications .",
    "the last section gives the conclusions .",
    "a non standard model for galaxy formation in qssc is built along the following lines : consider a set of points in the 3-dimensional space which represents the location of galaxies at a given instant of time .",
    "we now generate a set of new galaxies near each one of the galaxies ( `` non - local self - replication '' ) by a physical process which should quite minimally involve some extra negative energy field .",
    "the key ingredient of the nonstandard cosmological models is the existence of some `` creation field '' so that galaxies could generate new galaxies nearby ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let the probability for any given new galaxy to be located at a distance @xmath2 from an old galaxy be @xmath3 .",
    "this process will increase the number of galaxies as the universe evolves . in qssc ,",
    "a balance between creation and quasi - steady state structure is maintained by rescaling the size of the universe in each cycle .",
    "mathematically , this is taken into account by rescaling each of the 3 dimensions by a factor @xmath4 thereby increasing the volume of available space .",
    "( if we create _",
    "one _ new galaxy near an old one with a probability @xmath5 , then we will be doubling the number of galaxies during the self replication .",
    "the rescaling should be such that the volume doubles giving @xmath6 . for future convenience",
    ", we shall keep @xmath7 as an arbitrary constant . )",
    "we now select a subset of galaxies in the central region such that the total number of galaxies remain the same .",
    "this step renormalizes the process back to the original situation so that the process can now be repeated with the new subset of galaxies . in the specific case of number of galaxies doubling per cycle",
    ", we should take the central region containing half the volume .",
    "it is obvious that such a process of galaxy formation will lead to correlations between the galaxies since new galaxies are created close to the old ones with a probability @xmath5 .",
    "the key question is how the correlation function scales with the distance scale .",
    "we will now provide a mathematical analysis of this problem .    the evolutionary rule described above",
    "can be stated mathematically in the form : @xmath8 \\label{threeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are constants with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; @xmath5 is a probability function normalized to unity for integration over all @xmath2 .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath12 is normalized in such a way that its integral over all @xmath13 is unity .",
    "this gives us the conditions @xmath14 it is obvious that equation ( [ threeq ] ) preserves these conditions under evolution because of the explicit normalization chosen on the right hand side . in the context of the quasi steady state cosmological model",
    ", @xmath12 will be the ratio between the number density of galaxies and the mean density .",
    "the normalization in ( [ twoint ] ) preserves the quasi steady state condition between different cycles under the simultaneous action of matter creation and expansion .",
    "while equation ( [ threeq ] ) was motivated from a particular model for galaxy formation , the rest of the analysis only uses this equation and is independent of the assumptions which go into it . in section 4",
    "we will comment on a wider class of phenomena which could be modeled by such an equation .",
    "let us now consider the solutions to equation ( [ threeq ] ) .",
    "linearity in @xmath12 suggests switching to the fourier space variables @xmath15 with @xmath16 equation ( [ threeq ] ) now reduces to a simple form @xmath17 \\label{threek}\\ ] ] where we have denoted by the same symbol @xmath18 the fourier transform of the probability function .",
    "given the form of this probability function , this equation iteratively determines the evolution of @xmath19 .    while the equation is fairly simple in structure , it is not easy to find its general solution .",
    "note that the conservation condition ( [ twoint ] )  which demands @xmath20 for all @xmath21  is satisfied in this case because @xmath22 for a normalized probability distribution .",
    "this also shows that solutions of the form @xmath23 , with some constant @xmath24 , are unacceptable for @xmath25 because they will violate the normalization condition .",
    "further , since we have the freedom to choose the initial condition @xmath26 , any general solution to equation ( [ threek ] ) must contain one arbitrary function ; it is difficult to obtain such a _ general _ solution .",

    "this is true for a wide class of probability distributions with some characteristic scale @xmath36 , and @xmath37 usually decreases for @xmath38 .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath37 depends only on the magnitude of @xmath39 because of the statistical isotropy of the process ( though our results are easily generalizable to other cases ) .",
    "it follows that each of the denominators in ( [ lnsum ] ) is close to unity for all @xmath40 making all the terms negligibly small for @xmath40 .",
    "so we need to sum the series in ( [ lnsum ] ) only up to @xmath41 $ ] with the integer value , lower than the bound , taken for @xmath42 .",
    "the result of the sum depends on the form of @xmath43 at large @xmath44 .",
    "the simplest case corresponds to assuming the @xmath43 vanishes for @xmath38 which is exact if we take @xmath45 where @xmath46 for @xmath47 and zero otherwise .",

    "this is a power law solution with the index determined essentially by the two parameters of the problem .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us consider the effect of the normalization condition ( [ twoint ] ) more closely .",
    "this is of some interest because one might feel that such a normalization is unnecessarily restrictive and a wider class of phenomena can be modeled by relaxing this condition .",
    "it turns out , however , that our qualitative considerations are not affected by this constraint . relaxing this normalisation",
    "can be done most conveniently by replacing the factor @xmath49 in the denominator of the right hand side of ( [ threeq ] ) by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant different from @xmath52 .",

    "will either diverge or vanish .",
    "thus we get the condition @xmath68 for convergence thereby making equation ( [ fora ] ) identical to ( [ twof ] ) .",

    "thus , even in the continuum limit , our qualitative conclusions do not change when the condition ( [ twoint ] ) is relaxed .",
    "while the discussion above was modeled and motivated by galaxy formation in qssc , the process described here has a much broader range of applicability . the fact that our results were obtained for a model that does not involve gravity explicitly ( for example",
    ", neither newtonian gravitational constant nor the fact that gravitational force varies as a power law is used in the  rule \" mentioned above ) , suggests that results of the above kind could be quite general .",
    "in fact , there exists several natural phenomena that are described by power law correlations ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) . more often than not",
    ", such a correlation function seem to arise in a manner that does not depend critically on the details of the underlying dynamical model",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether one can provide a mathematical model with a minimal set of assumptions which can reproduce the power law correlation .",
    "one such minimal set of assumptions can be extracted from the above analysis and we can show that models based on these assumptions will have a generic behaviour .    consider a dynamical process in which some physical quantity @xmath117 evolves in time in a manner which depends on its value non locally .",

    "for example , the amount of bacteria in a culture , trees in an orchard , buildings in a city or the number of galaxies in some region of the universe could be studied by such prescription . to be more specific",
    ", we shall consider processes of the following kind : we start with a set of points in the d - dimensional space which represents the location of bacteria or galaxies or trees , say .",
    "we now generate a set of new points near each one of the points ( `` non - local self - replication '' ) .",
    "( the bacteria creating new bacteria nearby or trees generating new trees nearby or even cities leading to the formation of new cities nearby seem reasonable . )",
    "let the probability for any given new point to be located at a distance @xmath2 from an old point is @xmath121 .",
    "next , we rescale each of the @xmath122 dimensions by a factor @xmath4 thereby increasing the volume of available space .",
    "( this is useful in the case of growing bacterial culture or a jungle of trees or cities in order to avoid boundary effects which will limit the process . in the cosmological model",
    "mentioned above , this is a natural consequence of the expansion of the universe . )",
    "finally we select a subset of particles in the central region such that the total number of particles remains the same .",
    "this step renormalizes the process back to the original situation so that the process can now be repeated with the new subset of points .",
    "this evolutionary rule can be stated mathematically in the form : @xmath123 \\label{geneq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are constants with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; @xmath122 is the dimension of the space in which the vector @xmath13 lives , and @xmath5 is a probability function normalized to unity for integration over all @xmath2 .",
    "this is same as equation ( [ threeq ] ) with @xmath124 replaced by @xmath125 .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath12 is normalized in such a way that its integral over all @xmath13 is unity .",
    "as discussed above , this can be easily relaxed if required .",
    "it must be stressed that we can consider equation ( [ geneq ] ) as the basic postulate of this analysis rather than any physical model described in the last paragraph ( involving bacteria , trees , cities , galaxies .... ) . in particular : ( i ) we need not restrict to any specific form of @xmath5 or a choice for dimension @xmath122 ; ( ii ) it is also not necessary to identify the vector @xmath13 with the position vector in real space .",
    "the equation ( [ threeq ] ) can also describe quite effectively the power transfer in fourier space when the vector @xmath13 is actually identified with a fourier space vector .",
    "there are phenomena , like fluid turbulence , in which our analysis can be applied by using the power spectrum as the basic variable in @xmath39 space .",
    "the essential postulate will then be that power at nearby wave numbers is generated with a given probability .",
    "this could provide a tool for attacking a wide class of nonlinear phenomena .",
    "two point correlations functions which exhibit power law behaviour are very prevalent in nature .",
    "the analysis here suggests that two ingredients  which we have called ( i ) non local self replication and ( ii ) rescaling  can lead to such correlation functions fairly generically .",
    "the first of these two ingredients ( non local self replication ) allows similar entities to be created at nearby locations in some space",
    ". this could be as varied as bacterium creating new bacterium nearby by cell division , trees creating trees nearby by seeding or galaxies creating fresh galaxies because of the existence of a creation field .",
    "if we take the space to be the fourier domain , then transfer of power from a given wave number @xmath44 to nearby wave numbers will also constitute such a process .",
    "this variety shows that the ingredient ( i ) is fairly generic and natural .",
    "an immediate consequence of self replication as defined here is the development of correlations .",
    "this is because we have tacitly assumed that the members of the second generation are preferentially ( in the probabilistic sense ) produced near the original parents .",
    "this will naturally lead to the second generation to be correlated with the first , spatially .",
    "if the process takes place in the fourier domain , then the correlation will arise in the space of wave numbers and the consequent relationship in real space will be more complicated ; but even in this case correlation will definitely be established .",
    "( of course , in principle one can also introduce negative correlation in the model by choosing the probability distribution to be an increasing function of distance near the origin . )    in the context of conventional galaxy formation due to gravitational instability , the development of correlation is more indirect and dynamical while the process described here is direct and kinematical . ultimately , the kinematics of the model , encoded in the probability distribution function @xmath126 , need to be connected to an underlying model ( say , the creation field in the case of qssc ) in order to provide the dynamical basis . while this is the basic paradigm in physics ,",
    "it must be stressed that it suffers from two well known difficulties : ( a ) if the physical process is sufficiently complicated ( fluid turbulence , galaxy formation ... ) , it just may not be possible to provide such a dynamical underpinning .",
    "( b ) modeling different processes separately could lead one to miss the existence of a very general description for widely different classes of phenomena .",
    "much of the initial attraction for fractals in the description of natural phenomena originated from its promise to provide such a unifying perspective .",
    "the mathematical formalism developed here should be viewed against such a backdrop .",
    "the second ingredient that we have used ( rescaling ) essentially serves to renormalise the scales and is , in fact , very similar to ideas used in the theory of renormalization group .",
    "once self replication takes place , the system has become denser on the whole and in order to concentrate on the intrinsic correlation , it is necessary to renormalise the system back to the original state . in all the examples which we have it is always possible to link this rescaling with a tangible physical process .",
    "the combination of these two ingredients very nicely and naturally leads to a system with higher level of correlation at each time step .",
    "in fact , at least in the case of galaxy formation , the combined effect of these two phenomena is very similar to actual gravitational attraction between the particles .",
    "the key result of the analysis is that processes with these two ingredients are inherently unstable in the sense that the correlation function either grows without bound or decays to zero ( with the system becoming more and more dilute ) as @xmath127 .",
    "once again such an instability is reminiscent of similar phenomena seen in self gravitating systems though we have not used any gravitational dynamics .",
    "there is one special initial condition which leads to a static solution but as we discussed in the text , this is rather too special .",
    "the interest in these two systems lies in the intermediate time scale during which it could exhibit a power law correlation function very generically .",
    "once again the situation is similar to galaxy formation due to gravitational instability in which the observed power law correlation function will exist _ only _ during a limited temporal and spatial window in the numerical simulations . even in the case of fractals , it is generally known that one has to introduce cut - off in spatial and temporal scales in order to maintain power law correlation functions .    in conclusion , it is interesting how a fairly simple mathematical model could lead to an approximate description of a wide class of phenomena",
    ". only further investigations for specific contexts will determine whether such a unified treatment is of some value or whether these ideas are destined to remain as mathematical curiosities .",
