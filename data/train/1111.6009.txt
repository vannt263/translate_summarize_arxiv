    "the following general theorem is due to ramm @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 scattering amplitude @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( arbitrary small open subsets of @xmath9 ) determine @xmath10 uniquely in the function class @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the present treatment is restricted to spherically symmetric potentials , that is @xmath13 . in this case",
    "we have the partial wave expansion of the wave function : @xmath14 where @xmath15 satisfies the radial schrdinger equation ( see below ) with the appropriate boundary conditions . for",
    "spherically symmetric potentials the scattering amplitude takes a similar expansion form , namely @xmath16 the phase shifts , @xmath17 can be restricted to @xmath18 , since from the experimental point of view they are undetermined to an additive factor of @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "then it is apparent that the knowledge of the phase shifts is equivalent to that of the scattering amplitude .",
    "however not all the phase shifts ( as considered in the theorem of loeffel @xcite ) are needed for unique reconstruction of the potential .",
    "the following result is due to horvth and ramm @xcite .    the phase shifts @xmath21 determine the potential uniquely in the class @xmath22 if the mntz condition holds for @xmath23 : @xmath24 this condition is almost necessary in the sense that in the class @xmath25 with @xmath26 the set @xmath27 with @xmath28 is not enough to recover the potential uniquely .",
    "@xmath29 .",
    "it is because of this result that one may look for a potential when a part of the scattering phase shifts are known .",
    "the phase shift @xmath30 appears in the asymptotic form of the regular solution of the schrdinger equation , which is defined in the following manner : @xmath31,\\\\ \\varphi_\\ell(r)=\\frac{r^{\\ell+1}}{(2\\ell+1)!!}+o(r^{\\ell+1}),\\qquad r\\to0,\\\\ \\varphi_\\ell(r)=b_\\ell\\sin(r-\\frac{\\ell\\pi}{2}+\\delta_\\ell)+o(1),\\qquad r\\to\\infty\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 being a constant . note that for the @xmath33 zero potential we have @xmath34 , where @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the @xmath38th order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the povzner - levitan representation in the fixed energy problem @xcite has long been used , however the existence and uniqueness of a @xmath39 transformation kernel have been proven rigorously only recently @xcite for potential @xmath40 independent of @xmath41 and satisfying @xmath42 for @xmath43 we have a goursat - type problem ( equivalent to the schrdinger equation ) : @xmath44    now , in analogy with the fixed@xmath41 problem a gelfand - levitan - marchenko - type integral equation is written up for @xmath43 : @xmath45 since @xmath43 is unique this integral equation must have a unique solution for @xmath43 to make sense .",
    "furthermore , for consistency with the original schrdinger equation , @xmath46 must satisfy @xmath47 and through the integral equation @xmath48 is maintained .",
    "@xmath46 is a good candidate for approximation since its differential equation can be satisfied trivially .",
    "for instance if the angular momentum expansion @xcite @xmath49 is imposed then for the @xmath50 functions we have only the potential - independent restrictions of @xmath51 and the information is only stored in the @xmath52 expansion coefficients .",
    "in the framework of the method proposed by cox and thompson @xcite one takes the following separable form for the @xmath50 functions @xmath53 which is also the green s function of the @xmath33 radial schrdinger equation for the @xmath41th partial wave : @xmath54\\gamma_\\ell(r , r')=\\delta(r - r');\\ ] ] and the summation in @xmath46 runs only over a finite set @xmath55 of @xmath41 s : @xmath56 containing the riccati - bessel functions , connected to the bessel and neumann functions by @xmath57    for solving the glm - type equation ( [ glm ] ) we use the separable ansatz @xmath58 with a finite set @xmath59 of `` shifted angular momenta '' satisfying @xmath60 and @xmath61 . the use of such an ansatz can be motivated by the following result ascertained from @xcite .",
    "if @xmath62 , @xmath63 is imposed on @xmath43 and the @xmath64 numbers are restricted to @xmath65 then @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a one - to - one mapping .",
    "also , this form provides a reasonably easy way to solve the glm - type integral equation .",
    "in fact it makes a system of algebraic equations instead of the integral equation , namely @xmath68    the parameters of the set @xmath59 can be obtained from the phase shifts @xmath69 through the transformation equation ( [ pl ] ) which in terms of the @xmath64 s takes the form @xmath70 taking both equation ( [ pl1 ] ) and ( [ glmalg ] ) for large @xmath71 s , i.e. at @xmath72 we get the system of nonlinear equations @xcite connecting @xmath69 to @xmath59 : @xmath73 with @xmath74_{\\ell l}[m_{\\cos}^{-1}]_{l\\ell'}e^{\\pm i(\\ell-\\ell')\\pi/2}\\qquad \\ell\\in s,\\ ] ] @xmath75 after some investigation of this nonlinear system of equations one can conclude that for a given set of phase shifts it yields an infinity of solutions , each giving rise to a potential .",
    "it was our result in @xcite that one can select a physical potential ( perhaps uniquely ) with the aid of a consistency check .",
    "this check is first revisited in sec . 4 and then it is applied for the special cases of one and two dimensions , @xmath76 .",
    "before continuing with the consistency check it is worthwhile to further study the ct method particularly concerning the potential one can obtain by applying it .",
    "we address the case when only a finite number of input phase shifts are used to construct the potential .",
    "first , we show that the potential is generally not compactly supported nor is of long - range . to see this define the functions @xmath77 by the limit @xmath78 we infer from @xcite that the asymptotic coefficients @xmath79 assume the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 s and @xmath82 s are constant depending on all the elements of both @xmath55 and @xmath59 : @xmath83 @xmath84 this form in turn implies that @xmath85 and thus @xmath86 which means that the potential generally falls of like an inverse power of two",
    ".    one can give a necessary condition for the potential to decrease more rapidly then @xmath87 .",
    "one only needs @xmath88 the quantites @xmath4 and @xmath89 are given by @xmath90 alternatively , @xmath91 can be written as a series in @xmath41 ( this formula does not hold for @xmath43 with @xmath92 ) , @xmath93 which can readily be seen from the glm equation ( [ glm ] ) taken at @xmath94 and the ct formula ( [ ctg1 ] ) substituted for @xmath46 : @xmath95,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the formula ( [ pl ] ) for @xmath96 has appeared .",
    "this allows for the alternative conditions @xmath97 involving the expansion coefficients , the input phase shifts and the normalization constants of the partial wave functions .",
    "these new results may serve as useful tools to check numerical results or incorporated into a solution method they might provide a way to control the undesirable oscillations of the inverse potential .    at this point",
    "we shortly discuss the applicability of the ct method .",
    "the inverse potential is finite at the origin starting with a zero derivative ( see e.g. @xcite ) and possesses also a finite first moment @xmath98 . at fixed scattering energy",
    "the ct procedure is thus a particularly successful method for ( re)constructing inverse potentials .",
    "it was used to recover interaction potentials ( see e.g. @xcite ) for various physical system .",
    "furthermore it is also possible to generalize the method to recover potentials having coulomb tail e.g. by replacing the riccati - bessel function by coulomb wave functions @xcite .      in real - life scattering experiments one encounters cases when the colliding particles are zero spin bosons .",
    "then it is well - known that only the even numbered partial waves contribute to the scattering amplitude because of the symmetry of the wave function . in such cases with the ct method it is possible to use only the experimentally available phase shift data corresponding to even partial waves .",
    "it is then reasonable to ask for the value of phase shifts provided by the ct potential for the odd partial waves .",
    "it turns out that these odd phase shifts are zero .    to see this",
    "let us derive the phase shifts of the ct potential which can be obtatined from eq .",
    "( [ pl1 ] ) taken at @xmath72 : @xmath99 now the trigonometric form ( [ trigo ] ) is substituted for @xmath100 .",
    "there are two special cases that we consider : + i ) the set @xmath55 of input angular momenta consists of only even numbers , + ii ) @xmath55 consists of odd numbers .",
    "+ in the first case we have @xmath101 @xmath102 while in the second @xmath103 @xmath102 .",
    "this is deductible from eqs .",
    "( [ al ] ) and ( [ bl ] ) which assume the forms @xmath104 for the cases i ) and ii ) respectively .",
    "one can assume @xmath105 and @xmath106 , since the matrix @xmath107 with elements @xmath108 is invertible ( it is a cauchy matrix ) and can not be singular unless @xmath109 which is excluded by assumption .",
    "we thus have @xmath101 @xmath102 for i ) and @xmath103 @xmath102 for ii ) .",
    "now @xmath110 which implies @xmath111 in other words the ct phase shifts of the opposite parities are exactly zero .",
    "notice that the ct method allows the construction of potentials which are transparent for half the partial waves ( being even or odd in parity ) .",
    "applications suggest that if dealing with input partial wave data of one parity the performance of the ct method with the same number of input diminishes compared to the case when data with both parity is employed .",
    "therefore our sum rules derived in the previous subsection can be extremely useful to improve performance by supressing oscillations of the potential .",
    "also note that one of our sum rules simplify ( due to @xmath112 in the even case and @xmath113 in the odd case @xcite ) to @xmath114 while the other becomes @xmath115 and @xmath116 for the even and the odd case , respectively .",
    "the kernel @xmath46 only makes sense if the integral equation is uniquely solvable with it . as eq .",
    "( [ glm ] ) can be viewed as a fredholm type integral equation of the second kind for fixed @xmath71 , viz . if @xmath117 and @xmath118 we have @xmath119 according to fredholm s alternative the fredholm determinant thereof must be nonzero for all fixed @xmath120 .",
    "when using the ct ansatz the fredholm determinant of the integral equation becomes the determinant of the system of the algebraic equations ( [ glmalg ] ) , @xmath121_{\\ell l}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] it is easy to see that for @xmath122 one gets @xmath123 thus the potential is not in @xmath124 .",
    "while for @xmath125 we have @xcite @xmath126    one can conclude the following @xcite .    if and only if @xmath127 on @xmath120 we get a unique solution of the glm - type integral equation in @xmath128 and from that an inverse potential in @xmath124 .    from @xcite",
    "we know that @xmath127 on @xmath120 is not the case for arbitrary choice of @xmath55 and @xmath59 : e.g. there it was shown , that if @xmath129 and @xmath130 then @xmath131 at some @xmath120 .    with the help of theorem 4.1 we can convince ourselves that a particular ct inverse potential obtained numerically from arbitrary data is integrable or not .",
    "if it is so then that potential will generate the input phase shifts .    also , using the theorem it is possible to determine the admissible set of @xmath64 numbers for given @xmath41 s . in the one-@xmath41 case",
    "we get a straightforward admissible set of @xmath64 s , however in higher dimensions the formulation becomes extremely involved .      in this case ",
    "@xmath132 , @xmath133  the function @xmath134 must be examined carefully .",
    "this was performed in @xcite and thus it shall not be discussed here in detail .",
    "we only give the key idea of the proof : the wronskian @xmath135 is nonzero on @xmath136 if and only if the constituent bessel functions ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) are interlaced .",
    "this is deductible from the observation @xmath139    we could prove the next theorem of broader interest @xcite    the positive zeros of the bessel functions @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 for nonnegative orders , @xmath146 are interlaced according to the inequalities @xmath147 if and only if @xmath148 ( otherwise @xmath149 for some @xmath150 and @xmath151 for some @xmath152 ) .",
    "the following gives the admissible set @xmath153 .",
    "@xmath154 has no roots on @xmath155 , that is at @xmath156 the glm - type equation is uniquely solvable for the ct method with @xmath132 and @xmath157 if and only if @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath159 , @xmath160 is supposed .",
    "this result allows us to choose _ uniquely _ from the solutions of the system of equations ( [ nl ] ) as the solution for one input phase shift is @xmath161 which for @xmath162 $ ] in conjunction with the previous theorem yields @xmath163    at low energies it may happen that only one partial wave contributes mostly to the scattering amplitude ( e.g. for some partial wave resonances ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to look at the phase shifts yielded by the ct inverse potential at the one - phase - shift level to get a sense of the quality of the inversion procedure .",
    "deductible from eq .",
    "( [ pl1 ] ) is the following formula @xmath164 which specifies the phases of the ct potential for @xmath129 .",
