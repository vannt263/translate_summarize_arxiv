    "the ground state(s ) of a spin system are important since they determine its behavior and properties at low temperatures .",
    "although at low temperatures quantum fluctuations are prominent yet the classical ground state(s ) may contain valuable information .",
    "these classical ground states can be calculated by numerical or analytical methods for a number of special cases but a general theory does not exist despite a few attempts towards general results as , e.  g.  , @xcite or @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a special class of anisotropic systems , namely classical magnetic dipoles located at the vertices of a regular @xmath5polygon interacting via their magnetic fields , in short : dipole rings .",
    "there exists an overwhelming numerical evidence that the ground states of dipole rings are given by the two clockwise or anti - clockwise spin orientations tangent to the circle encompassing the dipole ring , see figure [ figgs ] .",
    "these states , denoted by @xmath6 , are consequently assumed to be the ground states in a couple of publications , e.  g.  , @xcite  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a rigorous proof of this fact seems not to exist . the motivation to publish such a proof is not to dispel remaining doubts about the ground state property of @xmath6 but rather to illustrate the problems that may occur even in analytically solvable cases and to provide methods to cope with these problems .    in section [ sec : r ] we shortly provide the basic definitions for magnetic dipole rings . for more details the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the proof of the ground state property of the two tangential states @xmath6 requires a large number of mostly elementary steps that are , however , intricately intertwined . in order to help the reader to keep track of the structure of the proof it will be in order to sketch the main ideas without going into details .",
    "the hamiltonian of the dipole ring is a bilinear function of the @xmath7 spin components @xmath8 and hence can be represented by a real , symmetric @xmath1 matrix @xmath2 such that the energy @xmath9 has the form of an  expectation value \" @xmath10 .",
    "it turns out that in our case @xmath2 can be completely diagonalized due to the @xmath11 symmetry of the dipole ring .",
    "in particular , there exists an eigenvector @xmath12 of @xmath2 that can be identified with the conjectured tangential ground state of the dipole ring .",
    "it  only \" remains to show that the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath13 is the lowest eigenvalue @xmath14 of @xmath2 for all @xmath15 . in this way we have reduced the ground state problem to a matrix problem in close analogy to the luttinger - tisza approach @xcite .",
    "the matrix in question is even diagonalized in closed form and hence the problem should be tractable .",
    "actually , the ground state problem could be solved along these lines of thought for any given @xmath0 provided that it could be treated by hand or by computer - algebraic software .",
    "we have done this in section [ sec : a ] for @xmath3 .",
    "the challenging problem is rather to prove @xmath16 for _ all _ @xmath0 .",
    "it can be further reduced to the problem whether the determinant of a @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 is strictly positive , where @xmath19 is a certain discrete parameter ( number of the finite fourier coefficient or wave number ) . however , the matrix entries are not explicitly given numbers but sums of approximately @xmath0 trigonometric functions and hence the positivity of the determinant is not obvious .",
    "as for many other problems it seems to be a good strategy to look at special cases . as noted above , the special case of small @xmath0 is well understood . what about the special case of @xmath20 ?",
    "this leads to the strategy of evaluating the mentioned sums asymptotically , i.  e.  , in the leading order w.  r.  t.  @xmath0 .",
    "the next step , see section [ sec : p ] , would then be to replace the asymptotic reasoning by strict inequalities and thus to obtain a proof of the ground state property of @xmath6 that is valid for , say , @xmath21 .",
    "here we encounter the next complication : already the asymptotic reasoning , and the more the formulation of rigorous estimates heavily depends on case distinctions .",
    "to explain this we remark that the above - mentioned determinant can be written as a double sum of the form @xmath22 .",
    "an obvious attempt to control the sign of the determinant is to split the terms @xmath23 into two parts , say , @xmath24 : the first part @xmath25 will be strictly positive whereas the second part @xmath26 may be positive or negative , depending on the parameters .",
    "one is then looking for a lower bound @xmath27 of the sum of the positive parts and an upper bound @xmath28 of the absolute value of the sum of the possibly negative parts and tries to show @xmath29 which is sufficient to complete the proof .",
    "unfortunately , the form of the splitting depends on @xmath30 , more precisely , whether @xmath31 or @xmath32 ( the other domains of @xmath30 being reduced to the former ones by means of symmetry arguments ) .",
    "moreover , the form of the bounds @xmath27 and @xmath28 , restricted to partial sums , depends on @xmath33 and @xmath34 and we are led to a variety of case distinctions , see table [ tab2 ] . especially , the domain of the parameter @xmath34 has to be divided into three parts .",
    "one reason is that , in the case of @xmath35 , the lower bound of the positive terms @xmath27 is of order @xmath36 . without any restriction of",
    "@xmath34 we could only show that @xmath37 which would not be sufficient even for an asymptotic proof . only with the restriction @xmath38",
    "we could achieve the result @xmath39 which entails @xmath29 for @xmath21 . in a similar way we found it necessary to introduce the further sub - division @xmath40 and @xmath41 in order to obtain reasonable bounds . here",
    "the three real parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 are first considered as variables and only after all bounds have been established , have to be chosen in an optimal way to obtain an @xmath43 as small as possible .",
    "some estimates crucially depend on the assumption @xmath4 ; hence we introduce the variable @xmath44 that is used in order to make some equations more transparent but has nevertheless the constant value @xmath45 .",
    "our final aim is to show @xmath46 but we must not assume this from the outset .",
    "one intermediate attempt gave an @xmath47 which is slightly above the desirable value of @xmath48 .",
    "hence we had to improve the bounds @xmath28 by using the explicit result @xmath49 that can be found , e.  g.  , in @xcite , thereby partly abolishing the former case distinction . after this move",
    "the choice @xmath50 was happily consistent with @xmath48 and i stopped improving estimates .",
    "however , the latter result was at first only obtained by numerical means .    here",
    "we face a subtle problem connected with the question to what extent a mathematical proof is allowed to be based on computer - algebraic means .",
    "it is clear that the present proof practically would not be possible without such means .",
    "but the crucial question is which means can be tolerated without vitiating the standard of a mathematical proof .",
    "i will adopt the position that computer - algebraic means are admissible as long as they could be replaced by paper - and - pencil operations albeit long and arduous ones .",
    "this needs some clarification .",
    "any computer program can , in principle , be simulated by a suitable turing machine and hence by paper - and - pencil operations .",
    "thus the above definition of  admissible computer - algebraic means \" only makes sense if it is _ not _ understood to be applicable  in principle \" but rather  in practice \" , even though this introduces some vagueness into the definition .",
    "for example , the simplifications leading from ( [ a5a ] ) to the results of table [ tabev ] have been performed using the computer - algebra software mathematica and not been checked by hand . but",
    "this appears to be a harmless use of computer software since it is completely clear what the equivalent paper - and - pencil operations would be and that they could be performed in a reasonable time . on the other hand , the claim that @xmath29 for @xmath4 is a statement about infinitely many real numbers and can not be justified by an inspection of a numerically produced graph .",
    "the latter can not be considered as a proof but at most as a strong numerical evidence .",
    "otherwise already the statement @xmath51 for all @xmath15 and all @xmath52 could be  proven \" by inspection of a graph and the whole proof presented in this paper would be pointless .    given this restriction of the use of computer - algebraic means in a mathematical proof , how should we then complete the present proof ?",
    "i will explain the chosen strategy for the situation given in figure [ figib ] .",
    "we replaced the condition @xmath29 by the equivalent one @xmath53 and plotted the two functions of @xmath0 for @xmath54 .",
    "it is evident that there is an intersection at @xmath55 and that @xmath53 for @xmath56 , but this will not suffice for the proof .",
    "what we can prove is that @xmath57 is an increasing ( linear ) function of @xmath0 and that @xmath58 is decreasing with the limits @xmath59 for @xmath20 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "( by an _ increasing _ function i always mean a _",
    "strictly monotonically increasing _",
    "one throughout this paper , analogously for _ decreasing _ functions . )",
    "the graphs of both functions hence intersect at a unique point with @xmath62 and @xmath53 for @xmath56 .",
    "for our purposes we need the stronger result that @xmath63 and this will be obtained by means of mathematica .",
    "this use of computer - algebraic software is now legitimate since it only involves the approximate evaluation of two elementary functions for two arguments , say , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the rationale for allowing computer - algebraic means here is that the approximate evaluation of elementary functions could be done by hand and would yield the same results and only require more time .",
    "one might object that the possibility of errors in applying the computer - algebraic software or even in the software itself can not be excluded but this is beside the point since even an alleged traditional mathematical proof may contain errors .",
    "the remaining part of the proof follows these guidelines .",
    "we consider systems of @xmath0 classical point - like dipoles .",
    "the normalized dipole moments are described by unit vectors @xmath66 .",
    "each dipole moment performs a precession about the momentary magnetic field vector that results as a sum over all magnetic fields produced by the other dipoles .",
    "the @xmath0 dipoles are fixed at the positions of the vertices of a regular @xmath5 polygon @xmath67 for the sake of simplicity , the length of the vectors @xmath68 is chosen as @xmath69 , but it can be scaled arbitrarily .",
    "the dimensionless energy of the dipole system is @xmath70 see @xcite ( 6.35 ) and @xcite . here",
    "@xmath71 denotes the unit vector pointing from the @xmath34-th dipole to the @xmath72-th one : @xmath73    by definition , the _ ground states _ of the system are spin configurations that minimize the energy ( [ r4 ] ) .",
    "numerical studies suggest that there are exactly two ground states , namely @xmath74 and @xmath75 , see figure [ figgs ] for an illustration . the present paper is devoted to the proof of this fact .     of the @xmath76 dipole ring .",
    "[ figgs ] , width=453 ]",
    "obviously , the hamiltonian ( [ r4 ] ) is bilinear in the components @xmath77 of the moment vectors @xmath78 and hence can be written in the form @xmath79 where we have introduced multi - indices @xmath80 that run through a finite set of size @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath81 be the lowest eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix @xmath2 .",
    "then , by the rayleigh - ritz variation principle , @xmath82 , but the minimal energy @xmath83 need not be equal to @xmath84 in general .",
    "we will prove that there exists a certain eigenvalue @xmath85 of @xmath2 such that the corresponding eigenvector can be identified with the state @xmath12 , see ( [ r5 ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath12 is a ground state if @xmath86 since in this case the lower bound @xmath87 of the energy is assumed by the spin configuration @xmath12 . + to detail the above remarks it is convenient to introduce new cartesian coordinates @xmath88 for the moment vectors @xmath78 that are better adapted to the @xmath89-symmetry of the problem : @xmath90 where @xmath91 . in the following",
    "we will express the energy @xmath92 in terms of the new coordinates ( [ a2 ] ) , where the transformed matrix will again be denoted by @xmath2 without danger of confusion .",
    "to this end we consider the part of the energy that is linear in @xmath93 : @xmath94 for the intermediate steps of the calculation we set @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "the eigenvectors @xmath107 of a circulant form the fourier basis , i.  e.  , are of the form @xmath108 and the eigenvalues are the fourier transform ( times @xmath109 ) of the circulant s first row , see @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath110 and @xmath111 are symmetric , whereas @xmath112 is anti - symmetric .",

    "the row sum of @xmath112 vanishes since @xmath112 is an anti - symmetric circulant .",
