    "with the arrival of detailed data on the interactions within social groups  generally coming from the on - line domain  an active line of research has developed around the phenomena taking place in these groups . to date , these analyses have mainly used structural features of the interactions , including who talks to whom , how frequently , and how these patterns of interaction form larger network structures .",
    "but the interactions themselves are generally taking place in natural language  both spoken and written  and the language content of these interactions has been a long - acknowledged missing ingredient in this style of investigation .",
    "the reason for this is clear : while it is reasonable to suppose that signals within the language could provide insight into the social structure of the group , it has been challenging to extract useful language - level signals . a small but growing line of work",
    "has begun to use textual content for uncovering structural properties of on - line networks @xcite ; it is exciting to contemplate extending the range of social properties that can be analyzed via text .",
    "[ [ power - and - linguistic - style ] ] * power and linguistic style * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper , we show how variations in linguistic style can provide information about power differences within social groups .",
    "our focus is on domains in which groups engage in goal - oriented discussions  situations where people interact , not necessarily collaboratively , in order to accomplish tasks or settle on choices .",
    "an important characteristic of such discussions is that the participants are invested in the issues at hand , so that their dialogs are not simply `` idle chat '' , but consequential : the outcome matters .",
    "examples include conversations among wiki editors or open - source teams regarding modifications ; debates within conference program committees on which papers to accept ; and discussions in legal hearings , where opposing sides compete to persuade a judge or jury .    power differences among the participants constitute a crucial force in all these settings .",
    "sometimes these power differences are embodied in formal roles , such as that of a judge or a program chair .",
    "sometimes they are based on more informal differences in the respect or authority commanded by individuals within the group . and sometimes they are more situational : @xmath0may have power over @xmath1 in a given situation because @xmath1needs something that @xmath0can choose to provide or not .",
    "it is natural to ask how we might try to create widely - applicable methods for inferring these power differences simply by observation of the language used within a group .",
    "this is particularly challenging if we are seeking methods that generalize across domains , and are not tied to specific choices of content . by way of analogy",
    ", imagine that you walk into a meeting among people you ve never met , and on a topic that you know nothing about ; what could you do to identify who are the most powerful members of the group ?",
    "if you were actually able to observe the people and hear them speaking to each other , then cues such as posture and vocal pitch can provide such information @xcite .",
    "but if we only have the text or transcripts of their interactions  the formats that online data often takes  how do we identify evidence of power differences ?",
    "[ [ language - coordination ] ] * language coordination * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we propose that _ language coordination _ in text content alone can serve as a rich source of information about power differences within a group .",
    "language coordination is a phenomenon in which people tend to unconsciously mimic the choices of function - word classes made by the people they are communicating with @xcite ; roughly speaking , if you are communicating with someone who uses a lot of articles  or prepositions , or personal pronouns  then you will tend to increase your usage of these types of words as well , even if you do nt consciously realize it .",
    "we measure language coordination in two datasets of goal - oriented text that arise in very different settings : discussions among wikipedia editors , containing over 240,000 conversational exchanges ; and oral arguments before the u.s .",
    "supreme court , as processed by hawes et al .",
    "@xcite and containing 50,389 conversational exchanges among justices and lawyers . by focusing on function word classes , rather than domain - specific substantive content , we are able to evaluate the domain - independence of our techniques and their ability to generalize across different contexts ; methods that rely on subject - specific cues to determine levels of power ( such as the use of `` your honor '' in a legal setting ) are not positioned to generalize as readily .    to be able to speak in a principled way about power differences ,",
    "we draw on the framework of _ exchange theory _ from sociology @xcite .",
    "exchange theory and its generalizations @xcite have distinguished between two forms of power , which naturally parallel the types of power in our discussion above .",
    "first , a power difference between @xmath0and @xmath1can be based on the fact that @xmath0has higher _ status _ than @xmath1 , either through a formal designation of status , or through more informal notions of status based on reputation within the group .",
    "second , a power difference can also arise through _ dependence _ : if @xmath1needs something from @xmath0 , and hence is dependent on @xmath0 , this can give @xmath0a form of at least temporary power over @xmath1 .",
    "[ [ power - differences - from - language - coordination ] ] * power differences from language coordination * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we find that differences in the level of language coordination consistently reveal both of these types of power differences , in both of our datasets .",
    "specifically , we will present the following results .    1 .   in general , people with low power exhibit greater language coordination than people with high power .",
    "conversely , people coordinate more with interlocutors who have higher power than with those who have lower power .",
    "3 .   when a person undergoes a change in status , their coordination behavior changes , and so does the coordination behavior of people talking to them .",
    "when an individual is trying to convince someone who holds an opposing view , this creates a form of dependence and hence a power deficit in the sense of exchange theory ; we find increased levels of language coordination in such cases .",
    "the relation between status level and the extent of language coordination transfers across domains , and is a reliable cross - domain feature for status prediction .",
    "these results suggest clear potential applications to the analysis of on - line social groups .",
    "in particular , they could provide methods for identifying power differences and levels of status in on - line settings where one has only the text content of social interactions , rather than explicit markers of status or explicitly annotated links .",
    "similarly , they could also provide a means of analyzing conversations between users of a social media platform so as to determine the power balance or levels of relative status in their relationship . in all such uses",
    ", the methods do not require domain - specific knowledge of the on - line application being analyzed .",
    "we also note that the role of features internal to the content can be crucial in some of these settings , since it has been observed that message frequency and message volume do not necessarily suffice to determine relative status . as rowe et al .",
    "state @xcite , `` as we move down the corporate ladder , the conversational flows of dissimilar employees can in fact be quite similar . ''",
    "indeed , it is easy to think of contexts where dominant individuals consume a lot of the conversational bandwidth , and others where , contrariwise , low - status individual take up most of the airtime with their advocacy toward higher - status participants .",
    "there is something striking about the fact that the content features being employed are properties of language that tend to escape conscious attention .",
    "the phenomena we find in the text content are consistent and significant , but they are not effects one notices in reading or listening to the interactions ; in essence , they operate on levels that only show up when you use computational methods to explicitly tune in to them",
    ". moreover , since our methods are based on function words , it means one can apply them to language samples from which the content words have been redacted , raising intriguing implications for compact representations and user privacy .

    "[ sec : hyp ] .",
    "these psychological studies of coordination focused on small - scale settings where participant behaviors could be individually observed ; the identification of language coordination phenomena in large - scale on - line text was done recently by @xcite using data from twitter . to our knowledge , our work is the first to identify connections between language coordination and social power relations at large scales , and across a diverse set of individuals and domains .",
    "in addition , our work here provides the following further novel contributions .    _ multiple domains with large amounts of data .",
    "_ by using large amounts of data , we can pick up subtle effects and explicitly vary some of the underlying conditions for coordination across different subsets of the data .",
    "moreover , working with two different corpora allows us to test the domain independence of our linguistic - coordination approach .",
    "_ status change .",
    "_ wikipedians can be promoted to administrator status through a public election , and almost always after extensive prior involvement in the community .",
    "since we track the communications of editors over time , we can examine how linguistic coordination behavior changes when a wikipedian becomes an `` admin '' .",
    "to our knowledge , our study is the first to analyze the effects of status change on specific forms of language use .",
    "_ situation - dependent forms of power .",
    "_ by generalizing from status to broader notions of power , our study is , to our knowledge , also the first to show how multiple types of power relationships  and in particular situation - dependent power  can be exposed through domain - independent textual features .",
    "we can apply communication accommodation theory @xcite , an influential line of research in sociolinguistics , to our investigations because the theory implies the following principle :    principle @xmath2 .",
    "linguistic coordination is a function of the power differential between the speaker and the target : the lower the power of the speaker relative to that of the target , the more she coordinates ( and vice versa , the higher the relative power of the speaker , the less she coordinates ) .    here and throughout , _ speaker",
    "_ refers to the person producing the reply in an exchange , and _ target",
    "_ refers to the person initiating the exchange ( and thus the target of the speaker s reply ) .",
    ": `` hi . ''",
    "@xmath3 : `` tired ? '' @xmath4 : `` no.''@xmath5 has two exchanges , one initiated by @xmath4 s `` hi '' , the other by @xmath3 s `` tired ? '' . ] in the context of group conversations , which is the focus of the present work , this principle leads to the following two concrete hypotheses , based on the ower of the target and of the speaker , respectively :    @xmath6 : people in general coordinate more towards _ high - powered _ people than towards _ low - powered _ people .",
    "@xmath7 : _ high - powered _ people coordinate less than _ low - powered _ people towards their targets .",
    "( neither hypothesis implies the other because we employ an asymmetric definition of coordination . )    in addition to power imbalance , we hypothesize that personal traits of the participants also influence how much they coordinate :    @xmath8 .",
    "people have a aseline coordination level , which is determined by personal characteristics ( such as their sociability and level of social engagement ) .",
    "it is worth noting that it is not actually _ a priori _ obvious that @xmath6and @xmath7hold at large . first , there are competing theories which postulate that the relation between power and coordination is the reverse of @xmath2 , due to a desire of high - status individuals to be understood @xcite .",
    "second , empirical studies supporting the hypotheses above are , while intriguing , relatively small in scale .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that larry king , the host of a popular talk - show in the u.  s. , coordinated more in his vocal pitch to his high - status guests ( such as then - president clinton ) than to low - status guests .",
    "as for _ linguistic style _",
    "coordination , @xcite looked at 15 watergate transcripts involving only four people altogether ( richard nixon and three of his aides ) ; small numbers of courtroom trials have also been considered @xcite .",
    "while power might correlate with certain personal traits in a given community , making the distinction between @xmath2and @xmath8difficult , they differ in one important aspect which we will exploit in our study : power can change abruptly  such as when an individual is assigned a new role  while personal traits , in comparison , are more stable over time . as a result ,",
    "examining the temporal change in coordination level of people who have undergone changes in power can help us isolate the effect of @xmath2from that of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , this will help us address the following question : if we do find evidence supporting hypothesis @xmath8 , would it be sufficient to explain the data , or will we see power playing a role on top of baseline individual coordination levels ?",
    "in this section , we describe the two corpora of consequential discussions we used in our studies .",
    "the first consists of discussions between editors on wikipedia ; the second consists of transcripts of oral arguments before the united states supreme court .",
    "both settings involve power differentials , both through status and dependence , as we will see below .",
    "our wikipedia corpus is much larger , potentially more representative of online discussions , and allows us to study the effects of changes in power ; but the supreme court represents a less collaborative situation than wikipedia ( in the supreme court data , there are always explicit opposing sides ) and is an instance of an off - line setting .",
    "the differences in the two corpora help us focus on general , domain - independent relationships between relative power and linguistic coordination .",
    "we begin by briefly describing the roles and text content of our two domains , and then discuss how we formalize the different kinds of power imbalances within the domains .",
    "we will release our data publicly at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian / www2012/.      * roles and role changes . * wikipedia editors form a close community with salient markers of status .",
    "administrators , commonly known as _",
    "admins _ , are wikipedia editors `` trusted with access to restricted technical features '' such as protecting or deleting pages or blocking other editors . in effect",
    ", admins have a higher status than other users ( _ non - admins _ ) in the wikipedia community , and editors seem to be well aware of the status and activity history of other editors .",
    "users are promoted to admins through a transparent election process known as requests for adminship , or _",
    ", where the community decides who will become admins . since rfas are well documented and timestamped , not only do we have the current status of editors , we can also extract the exact time when editors underwent role changes from non - admins to admins .    * textual exchanges . *",
    "editors on wikipedia interact on _ talk _ pages to discuss changes to article or project pages .",
    "we gathered 240,436 conversational exchanges carried out on the talk pages , where the participants of these ( asynchronous ) discussions were associated with rich status and social interaction information : status , timestamp of status change if there is one , and activity level on talk pages , which can serve as a proxy of editors sociability , or how socially inclined they are .",
    "in addition , there is a discussion phase during rfas , where users `` give their opinions , ask questions , and make comments '' about an open nomination .",
    "candidates can reply to existing posts during this time .",
    "we extracted conversations that occurred in rfa discussions , and obtained a total of 32,000 conversational exchanges .",
    "most of our experiments were carried out on the larger dataset extracted from talk pages , unless otherwise noted .",
    "while wikipedia discussions provide a large - scale dataset with rich meta - information , overall , high - status people and low - status people are collaborating to accomplish a task .",
    "other social hierarchies involve much less collaboration or even explicitly adversarial relationships .",
    "oral arguments before the supreme courtprovide such a setting .    * roles . *",
    "a full court consists of nine justices , although occasionally some recuse themselves . in the oral arguments for a case ,",
    "lawyers for each party have thirty minutes to present their side to the justices .",
    "the justices may interrupt these presentations with comments or questions , leading to interactions between the lawyers ( plus amici curiae , who for our status - based investigations count as lawyers ) and justices .",
    "after the oral arguments and subsequent deliberations , cases are decided by majority vote of the justices .",
    "this provides an interesting additional test ground : instead of asynchronous textual exchanges in a social hierarchy working collaboratively , here we have verbal exchanges in a social hierarchy where _ justices _ decide the final outcome .",
    "in addition , conversations here are over topics in a completely different domain .",
    "* transcripts of verbal exchanges .",
    "* transcripts of oral arguments in supreme court are publicly available .",
    "we used a pre - processed version of this dataset described in @xcite .",
    "we enhanced this dataset with the final votes from the spaeth supreme court database . in total",
    ", we have 50,389 verbal exchanges for 204 cases .",
    "11 justices ( two of which have little conversational data : thomas and alito ) and 311 lawyers are represented in the dataset .",
    "73% of the lawyers only appear in one case , and the maximum number of cases where one lawyer appears is 15 .",
    "as such , trends identified on this dataset should not be due to idiosyncratic behavior of a few over - represented lawyers .",
    ".power differentials exhibited in our data .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^ \" , ]     the main finding here , in figure [ fig : gender ] , is that overall female lawyers coordinate more than male lawyers when talking to justices , and correspondingly , justices coordinate more towards male lawyers than towards female lawyers . given the extensive history of work exploring culturally - embedded status and power differences based on gender @xcite , one interpretation of this finding is directly in terms of hypothesis @xmath2 .",
    "however , since it is also potentially related to theories of gender - based communication differences @xcite and even gender - based language adaptation differences @xcite , the question of separating hypotheses @xmath9 and @xmath10 becomes challenging here .",
    "we think it is a promising possibility that language coordination effects may be able to serve as a lens through which to measure many similar kinds of distinctions in both on - line and off - line conversational settings .",
    "in the opening sections , we have discussed some of the ways in which earlier work used text content to analyze on - line networks @xcite , as well as background on language coordination and the exchange - theoretic notions of power from status and dependence . here",
    "we discuss some further work that is related to the general issues we consider here",
    ".    * power and structural features .",
    "* there has been extensive work on using structural features , rather than language , to infer notions of `` importance '' in networks , both in the literature on social networks @xcite and on the web @xcite .",
    "recent work has also studied the inference of status from on - line social network features @xcite .      and status has mostly been examined in small - scale contexts : 15 watergate transcripts @xcite , 40 courtroom cases @xcite , or a single simulated courtroom trial @xcite . a recent large - scale study of language coordination in the on - line",
    "domain @xcite used data from twitter , where markers of status and power are not as readily inferred ; they identified a weak correlation between language coordination and twitter follower counts , suggesting a potential connection to status measures .",
    "additionally , researchers have used text features other than linguistic coordination to identify status differences @xcite ; in contrast with our work , these methods picked up situation - specific cues , such as the word `` termination '' for the enron corporate - email corpus @xcite , which are unlikely to generalize across contexts .    * collaborative communities . *",
