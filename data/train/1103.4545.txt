    "there are 66 high - confidence identifications of blazars in the third catalog of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) detected by the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _ , which include 20 bl lac objects ( e.g. @xcite ) . the lat bright agn sample ( lbas ) detected by fermi includes 104 blazars consisting of 42 bl lac objects , 57 flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , and 5 blazars with uncertain classification @xcite .",
    "comptonization is believed to be responsible for the @xmath1-ray emission from blazars , which can be classified into two categories : the external comptonization ( ec ) model and the synchrotron self - comptonization ( ssc ) model , according to the origin of the soft seed photons ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review and references therein ) . in the ec models ,",
    "the soft seed photons are assumed to originate from the accretion disks , the broad - line regions ( blrs ) , or / and the dust tori ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was suggested that the ssc model may be responsible for @xmath1-ray radiation from bl lac objects while the ec model predominates over ssc model for quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the statistical analysis on a sample of egret blazars implied that the soft seed photons may be predominantly from the blrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is consistent with the lack of blr and other external fields emission in most bl lac objects .",
    "their results are roughly consistent with the detailed modeling of seds for a large sample of @xmath1-ray bright agns by @xcite , in which all external field photons from blr , accretion disk , and dust torus , are properly considered .",
    "however , the situation becomes more complicated for radiation in other wavebands ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "it was found that the x - ray radiation from some fsrqs ( e.g. , 3c  273 ) is consistent with combined ssc and ec mechanisms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the extragalactic diffuse @xmath1-ray background ( egrb ) was first discovered by the sas 2 satellite @xcite and subsequently confirmed after the launch of egret @xcite .",
    "the egrb integrated above 100 mev was determined to be @xmath6 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 sr@xmath8 @xcite . using a new model of the galactic background ,",
    "@xcite obtained a slightly smaller value of the egrb , @xmath9photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 sr@xmath8 .",
    "almost all extragalactic @xmath1-ray sources in the third egret catalog are identified as blazars , which account for about 13% of the egrb @xcite .",
    "the contribution of unresolved blazars to the egrb has been explored in many previous works , either by extrapolating the observed @xmath1-ray luminosity distribution to obtain a @xmath1-ray luminosity function ( lf ) or using the correlation of @xmath1-ray emission with the emission in radio bands derived from egret blazars , which showed that about @xmath1025% to @xmath10100% of the egrb can be attributed to the unresolved blazars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a new revised catalogue of egret @xmath1-ray sources ( egr2008 ) was given by @xcite , and a larger catalogue of the lat bright agn sample ( lbas ) detected by fermi was released recently @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we derive a correlation between @xmath1-ray and radio emission for a sample of bl lac objects detected by egret or / and fermi @xcite .",
    "we estimate the @xmath1-ray duty cycle of bl lac objects detected by egret and fermi , and the @xmath1-ray lf of bl lac objects is calculated with this empirical correlation from their radio lf and @xmath1-ray duty cycle .",
    "the radio lf of bl lac objects derived by @xcite based on the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) is used in this work .",
    "we further estimate the total number of bl lac objects to be detected by fermi , and the contribution of all bl lac objects to the egrb .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 have been adopted in this paper .",
    "the recently released lat bright agn sample ( lbas ) detected by fermi includes 42 bl lac objects , of which 11 sources were already detected by egret .",
    "till now , there are 51 bl lac objects detected either by egret or fermi [ with the test statistic ( ts ) value above the egret threshold ( @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and 5@xmath16 for @xmath17 ) ; or 10@xmath16 for the sources detected by fermi ] .",
    "there are 40 bl lac objects with measured redshifts , which are adopted for our present investigation .",
    "the radio/@xmath1-ray flux and photon index @xmath18 above 100mev for the sources are listed in table 1 . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot the relation between radio luminosity @xmath19 at 5  ghz and @xmath1-ray luminosity @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) for these bl lac objects , where the average k - corrected radio and @xmath1-ray fluxes are adopted for calculating @xmath20 and @xmath19 . we find a significant correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( the correlation coefficient @xmath22 ) .",
    "the linear regression of the sample gives @xmath23 @xcite investigated the relation between 8.4ghz radio flux density and @xmath1-ray flux density for fermi blazar sample .",
    "the peak values are adopted by @xcite , which are likely to correspond to a short time - scale flare state of a source .",
    "@xcite investigated the relation between quasi - simultaneous @xmath1-ray and 15ghz radio flux densities in fermi blazar sample , which includes xx bl lac objects .",
    "the mean fluxes above 100  mev are adopted in this work , and the sample is limited to bl lac objects , which should be a suitable choice , because we focus on the statistic properties of @xmath1-ray bl lac objects as a whole population in this work",
    ". the significance of the correlation found in this work is higher than that found by @xcite , which may be attributed to the fact that only the peak @xmath1-ray fluxes were adopted in their analysis . for @xmath1-ray quasars ,",
    "the situation is more complicated , as their @xmath1-ray emission is not only dependent on their radio emission , but also on the origins of the soft seed photons , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "based on the correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 established with a sample of bl lac objects , we can calculate the @xmath1-ray lf of bl lac objects from their radio lf .",
    "recently , @xcite derived a lf for bl lac objects based on the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) , which extends to lower luminosity than that derived by @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use @xcite s radio lf to derive the @xmath1-ray lf of bl lac objects .    although a tight correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath24 is found for @xmath1-ray bl lac objects , we find that only a small fraction of bl lac objects were detected by egret , which may imply that the detection of blazars in @xmath1-ray energy band is not only dependent on their radio emission , but also on their @xmath1-ray activity . the @xmath1-ray emission is closely related with radio emission for bl lac objects based on ssc models .",
    "more distant or / and fainter bl lac objects can be detected if the sensitivity is improved .",
    "@xcite found that the redshift distribution of fermi bl lac objects ( @xmath25 ) is similar to that of the dxrbs bl lac sample ( @xmath26)@xcite .",
    "this may imply that the radio - gamma correlation found in this work has not been affected by the redshift distribution of @xmath1-ray bl lac objects .",
    "thus , we induce a @xmath1-ray duty cycle @xmath3 for bl lac objects , which can be estimated from the ratio of @xmath1-ray bl lac objects to the total ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". there are 36 bl lac objects were detected by egret and fermi , among which the lowest radio flux density at 5  ghz is @xmath270.25 jy . the number of bl lac objects above this flux density limit with the same sky coverage of the survey carried out with egret / fermi is @xmath10330 ( e.g. , see figure [ fig4 ] in @xcite ) , which leads to @xmath2 . @xcite estimate the @xmath1-ray activity using three different methods .",
    "our result is consistent with the maximum distribution of blazars active fraction computed in @xcite ( see fig.14 of @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1-ray lf of bl lac objects can then be calculated with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath1-ray lf , and the radio lf @xmath30 is given by @xcite .",
    "we can use a simple glf model defined as @xmath31 in figure [ fig2 ] , we compared our @xmath1-ray lf * ( @xmath32 ) * derived from the radio lf and that directly derived with a sample of @xmath1-ray bl lac objects detected by fermi @xcite .",
    "the slope of our @xmath1-ray lf is well in agreement with the value of @xmath33 reported for fermi bl lac objects .",
    "our @xmath1-ray lf is slightly less than that of @xcite , but taking into account the observational error , we can also say our @xmath1-ray lf is roughly consistent with that of fermi .    the number count of bl lac objects as a function of @xmath1-ray flux above 100  mev can be calculated with the derived @xmath1-ray lf , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is adopted in our calculations , because the radio lf for bl lac objects was derived with a sample of sources with redshifts @xmath36 ( see @xcite , for the details ) .",
    "this means that the results derived here are only the lower limits .",
    "in fact , almost all @xmath1-ray bl lac objects detected have redshifts @xmath37 ( only 2 of 40 have redshifts slightly higher than unity ) .",
    "we plot the number count of @xmath1-ray bl lac objects derived from the lf calculated with equation ( [ glf ] ) in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "obviously , the increasing number of sources can be detected following a decreasing flux limit , such as @xmath38 at @xmath39 ( the fermi sensitivity for one year ) @xcite , and @xmath40 at @xmath41 ( the fermi sensitivity for two year ) @xcite .",
    "the egrb contributed by all bl lac objects can be calculated with the @xmath1-ray lf derived with equation ( [ glf ] ) , @xmath42 where the average photon spectral index @xmath43 for bl lac objects is adopted , which is slightly higher than @xmath44 given by @xcite .",
    "this is due to that our sample includes 9 egret sources , of which the photon spectral indexes are all greater than 2.0 except 1011@xmath45496 .",
    "the contribution of the bl lac objects to the egrb as a function of @xmath1-ray flux limit @xmath46 is plotted in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "it was suggested that the @xmath1-ray radiative mechanisms are different for quasars and bl lac objects , i.e. , the ec mechanism may be responsible for quasars , while the ssc is for bl lac objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a linear relation between radio and @xmath1-ray emission is expected for agns , if the ssc mechanism is responsible for @xmath1-ray emission ( see , e.g. , equation ( 28 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation between radio and @xmath1-ray emission for bl lac objects found in this work is very close to a linear one as described in equation(1 ) , which seems to support the ssc mechanism for @xmath1-ray emission from bl lac objects .",
    "the variability of @xmath1-ray emission in 10 sources of 42 fermi bl lac objects have been detected .",
    "the faction is much less than that of fsrqs ( 45/57)@xcite , which implies that the variability of @xmath1-ray emission from bl lac objects could be weaker than that from fsrqs .",
    "the detection rate in @xmath1-ray band may be dominantly related to the duty cycle of @xmath1-ray bl lac objects .",
    "@xcite investigated the @xmath1-ray activity of egret blazars and estimated their @xmath1-ray duty cycle .",
    "they found that about 48 percent of the sources fall into @xmath47 , and 74 percent sources are in @xmath48 .",
    "the duty cycle @xmath49 derived in this work is roughly consistent with the results in @xcite ( while their @xmath1-ray duty - cycle was computed without a clear distinction between bl lacs and fsrqs . ) .        in this work ,",
    "the @xmath1-ray lf of bl lac objects is derived from the radio lf by using the empirical correlation of @xmath1-ray emission with radio emission , which can almost reproduce the @xmath1-ray lf calculated directly with the @xmath1-ray bl lac objects detected by fermi / egret ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "based on the derived @xmath1-ray lf for bl lac objects , we can calculate the number count of @xmath1-ray bl lac objects as a function of flux limit in @xmath1-ray band .",
    "we find that about 1000 bl lac objects will be detected by fermi , if its sensitivity is 30 times higher than that of egret at 100  mev @xcite .",
    "@xcite s estimate show that about 1200 quasars can be detected by fermi based on the ec mechanism for their @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "the recently released bright agn sample detected by fermi together with the sources already detected by egret with high - confidence leads to a sample of 135 @xmath1-ray blazars ( 77 quasars , 51 bl lac objects and 7 blazars with uncertain classification ) .",
    "the ratio of quasars to bl lac objects for the present sample ( lbas+egret ) is about 1.5 , which is slightly higher than 1200/1000 , which implies that more bl lac objects are expected to be detected by the fermi in the future .    integrating the derived @xmath1-ray lf",
    ", we calculate the contribution of all bl lac objects to the egrb , which accounts for @xmath1045% of the egrb ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "@xcite s calculation show that all radio quasars and fr ii radio galaxies contribute about @xmath1032% of the egrb .",
    "this means that the contribution of bl lac objects is similar to that of quasars , which is roughly consistent with the predicted number ratio of quasars to bl lac objects to be detected by fermi .",
    "the contribution of all blazars ( quasars+bl lac objects ) can account for @xmath1077% of the egrb , which implies there still some space ( @xmath50 ) is left for other sources to the egrb .",
    "considering that our calculations are limited to @xmath51 for bl lac objects , the contribution of the sources other than blazars to the egrb should be lower than the value derived in this work .",
    "we also noticed the detection of @xmath1-ray emission from relativistic jets in the narrow - line seyfert-1 galaxies ( pmn 0948 + 0022)@xcite , which means that the mechanism of @xmath1-ray radiation from narrow - line seyfert-1 galaxies is similar to that for blazars . considering that a fraction of narrow - line seyfert-1 galaxies are radio - loud ( e.g. @xcite ) and some of them show evidence for relativistic jets ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the contribution of radio - loud narrow - line seyfert-1 galaxies to the egrb may be important , however , the detailed calculation is beyond the scope of this work .",
