    "the sequence of catalan numbers ( a000108 in  @xcite ) is arguably the most well - know combinatorial sequence .",

    "otherwise , @xmath5 avoids @xmath0 .",
    "] , for any permutation @xmath0 of size @xmath6 . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in catalan numbers as well as in two larger combinatorial sequences : the schrder and baxter numbers .",
    "baxter numbers ( sequence a001181 in  @xcite ) were first introduced in  @xcite , where it is shown that they count baxter permutations .",
    "they also enumerate numerous families of combinatorial objects , and their study has attracted significant attention , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "many such baxter families can be immediately seen to contain a catalan subfamily .",
    "for instance , the set of triples of non - intersecting lattice paths ( nilps from here on ) contains all pairs of nilps ( that are in essence parallelogram polyominoes , see figure  [ fig : pp ] ) ; and baxter permutations , defined by the avoidance of the vincular[1pt]{~\\ ~}$ ] the elements of the pattern that are required to be adjacent in an occurrence .",
    "the definition of avoidance of a vincular pattern will be reviewed in section  [ sec : baxter ] . ]",
    "patterns @xmath7[1pt]{41}3 $ ] and @xmath8[1pt]{14}2 $ ] , include @xmath0-avoiding permutations , for any @xmath9 .",
    "on the other hand , the ( large ) schrder numbers ( sequence a006318 ) seem to be a bit less popular .",
    "they also form a sequence point - wise larger than the catalan sequence , and it is additionally point - wise smaller than the baxter sequence .",
    "this transpires easily on permutations , where the schrder numbers are counting the separable permutations  @xcite , defined by the avoidance of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to explain and illustrate the inclusions `` _ _ catalan in schrder in baxter _ _ '' .",
    "although these inclusions are obvious on pattern - avoiding permutations , they remain quite obscure on other objects . indeed , looking at several combinatorial objects",
    ", it appears that the permutation example is a little miracle , and that the unclarity of these inclusions is rather the rule here . to give only a few examples ,",
    "consider for instance lattice paths : the dyck paths generalize into schrder paths , but have to our knowledge no natural baxter analogue ; on the contrary , pairs of nilps are counted by catalan , whereas triples of nilps are counted by baxter , leaving schrder aside . or ,",
    "consider another well - known catalan family : that of binary trees .",
    "there are schrder and baxter objects generalizing binary trees ( like schrder trees , with an additional sign on the root on one hand , or pairs of twin binary trees on the other ) , but they have apparently nothing in common",
    ".    as these examples illustrate , the baxter and schrder generalizations of catalan objects are often independent and are not easily reconciled .",
    "this fact is also visible at a more abstract level , _",
    "i.e. _ without referring to specific combinatorial families : by considering the generating trees ( with their corresponding succession rules ) associated with these sequences ( we will review the basics of generating trees in section  [ sec : catalan ] ) .",
    "as we demonstrate in this work , for the known generating trees associated with the schrder and baxter numbers , when they can be seen as generalizations of the generating tree of catalan numbers , then these two generalizations go in two opposite directions .",
    "our main contribution is to provide a continuum from catalan to baxter via schrder , that is visible at the abstract level of succession rules . specializing these on particular objects , it allows us to define compatible schrder and baxter generalizations of catalan objects .",
    "we will focus mostly on generalizations of parallelogram polyominoes , that we call _ slicings _ of parallelogram polyominoes .",
    "section  [ sec : baxter ] defines our baxter slicings ( showing also their tight connection with triples of nilps ) .",
    "these new objects allow us to see that the usual baxter succession rule does nothing but symmetrize the catalan succession rule . in section  [ sec :",
    "schroeder ] , we introduce a new succession rule associated with schrder numbers , that interpolates between the catalan and baxter rules of sections  [ sec : catalan ] and  [ sec : baxter ] . letting our slicings grow with this rule allows us to define the family of schrder slicings .",
    "from there , the last two sections go in different directions .",
    "section  [ sec : other_schroeder ] presents other schrder subclasses of baxter classes , obtained _ via _ our new schrder succession rule : in the case of triples of nilps and of permutations . in section",
    "[ sec : extensions ] , we introduce more intermediate classes between catalan and baxter , refining our new schrder succession rule with a parameter that may vary .",
    "there are many ways of defining ( or characterizing ) parallelogram polyominoes in the literature , and we only give one that fits our needs .    a _ parallelogram polyomino _ @xmath12 ( see an example on figure  [ fig : pp](a ) ) is an ( edge-)connected set of unit cells in the cartesian plane , that is the interior of a contour defined by two paths , which are composed of @xmath13 and @xmath14 steps and which never meet except at their beginning and end . denoting @xmath15 the dimension of the minimal bounding rectangle of @xmath12 , the semi - perimeter of @xmath12 is @xmath16 , and the size of @xmath12 is @xmath17 .     of size @xmath18 ,",
    "( b ) a baxter slicing of shape @xmath12 , and ( c ) the triples of nilps associated with it .",
    "[ fig : pp ] ]    we start by reviewing generating trees  @xcite , and in particular the generating tree for catalan numbers associated with parallelogram polyominoes .    a _ generating tree _ for a combinatorial class @xmath19 is a infinite rooted tree , whose vertices are the objects of @xmath19 , each appearing exactly once in the tree , and such that objects of size @xmath20 are at distance @xmath20 from the root ( with the convention that the root is at distance @xmath21 from itself , and is labeled by the only object of size @xmath21 in @xmath19 ) .",
    "the children of some object @xmath22 are obtained adding an _ atom _ ( _ i.e. _ , a piece of object that makes its size increase by @xmath21 ) to @xmath23 . of course",
    ", since every object should appear only once in the tree , not all additions are possible .",
    "we should ensure the unique appearance property by considering only additions that follow some restricted rules .",
    "we will call the _ growth _ of @xmath19 the process of adding atoms following these prescribed rules .    ]",
    "a generating tree of parallelogram polyominoes was described in  @xcite , and the corresponding growth is illustrated on figure  [ fig : growth_pp ] .",
    "the atoms that may be inserted are rightmost columns ( of any possible height from @xmath21 to the height of the current rightmost column ) , and topmost rows of width @xmath21 .",
    "note that the restriction on the width of the new row added is here only to ensure that no polyomino is produced several times .",
    "note also that the symmetric growth , that allows rows of any admissible width but columns of height @xmath21 only , also describes a generating tree for parallelogram polyominoes , which is isomorphic to the first one .",
    "all that matters to us is the _ shape _ of a generating tree , forgetting the combinatorial objects on the vertices . in what follows",
    ", we will use the phrase `` generating tree '' to denote this shape only , referring instead to `` full generating trees '' when the nodes are carrying combinatorial objects .",
    "generating trees become substantially useful if they can be described in an abstract way , without referring to the details of the combinatorial objects . more precisely , for a combinatorial class @xmath19 , assuming that there is a statistics on the objects of @xmath19 , whose value determines the number of children in the full generating tree , then the ( shape of the ) generating tree depends only on how the value of the statistics evolves from a object to its children .",
    "when such a statistics exists , we give _ labels _ to the objects of @xmath19 , which indicate the value of the statistics .",
    "the associated _ succession rule _ is then given by the label of the root and , for any label @xmath24 , the labels of the children of an object labeled by @xmath24 .",
    "a succession rule characterizes completely a generating tree .    in the case of parallelogram polyominoes ,",
    "the number of children is determined by the height of the rightmost column ( namely , it is this height @xmath25 ) , and it is easy to follow the height of the rightmost column along their growth .",
    "it follows that the generating tree of parallelogram polyominoes described above is completely determined by the following succession rule : @xmath26 we will denote this generating tree by @xmath27 .",
    "it is represented in figure  [ fig : generatingtrees ] .",
    "note that , given a succession rule and its subsequent generating tree , we can associate with it an enumeration sequence , whose @xmath20-th term @xmath28 is the number of vertices in the tree at distance @xmath20 from the root .",
    "of course , @xmath29 is the enumeration sequence of any combinatorial class that has a ( full ) generating tree encoded by the given succession rule .",
    "but our point , which will be essential later on , is that the sequence may also be associated directly with the generating tree , without reference to any combinatorial class . on our example",
    ", it follows that rule ( and the corresponding tree @xmath27 ) is associated with the catalan numbers , hence its name .",
    "there are several succession rules associated with baxter numbers  @xcite",
    ". we will be interested in one of these rules only which , in addition to being the most well - known , is the one that generalizes the rule for catalan number in the most natural way .",
    "the rule is :    @xmath30    we denote by @xmath31 the generating tree associated with this rule , and shown in figure  [ fig : generatingtrees ] .",
    "a proof that it corresponds to baxter numbers can be found in  @xcite , where it is proved that the baxter permutations grow according to rule  .",
    "recall that baxter permutations are those avoiding the vincular patterns @xmath7[1pt]{41}3 $ ] and @xmath8[1pt]{14}2 $ ] , _ i.e. _ permutations @xmath5 such that no subsequence @xmath32 satisfies @xmath33 or @xmath34 . from  @xcite ,",
    "the growth of baxter permutations according to rule   consists , for any baxter permutation @xmath5 , in inserting a new maximum element either immediately to the left of a left - to - right maximum of @xmath5 , or immediately to the right of a right - to - left maximum of @xmath5 .",
    "the label @xmath35 of a permutation records the number of its left - to - right maxima ( for @xmath36 ) and right - to - left maxima ( for @xmath24 ) .",
    "it is easily seen , however rarely noticed , that rule   generalizes rule   ( so that @xmath31 contains a subtree isomorphic to @xmath27 ) .",
    "indeed , the production of label @xmath35 in rule   includes labels @xmath37 for @xmath38 and label @xmath39 , for instance . but choosing @xmath40 instead would of course also satisfy our purpose . ] . keeping track of the second element of the label only gives back the catalan rule  .",
    "moreover , for another subset of the labels produced , the same holds keeping track of the first element only .    in some sense ,",
    "rule   is just the symmetric version of rule  .",
    "this is very well understood on the growth of parallelogram polyominoes according to rule  .",
    "as we have seen , with rule  , a rightmost column may be added , of all possible heights ; but only a topmost row of width @xmath21 is allowed .",
    "but the symmetric variant of this rule , allowing addition of a topmost row of all possible widths , and of a rightmost column of height @xmath21 , also works .",
    "so we can think of rule   as generating parallelogram polyominoes symmetrically , allowing at the same time the insertion of a rightmost column of any possible height , or of a topmost row of any possible width .",
    "of course , this process generates the parallelogram polyominoes ambiguously .      our remark that rule   generates parallelogram polyominoes symmetrically but ambiguously motivates the definition of new combinatorial objects , that generalize parallelogram polyominoes , and grow unambiguously according to rule  . from the discussion above , the natural generalization is to let parallelogram polyominoes grow according to rule   as we explain , but to record the `` building history '' of the polyomino , that is , which columns and rows where added by the growth process .",
    "the objects obtained are parallelogram polyominoes whose interior is divided into blocks , of width or height @xmath21 .",
    "we call these objects _ baxter slicings of parallelogram polyominoes _ , or _ baxter slicings _ for short .",
    "a _ baxter slicing _",
    "( see an example on figure  [ fig : pp](b ) ) of size @xmath20 is a parallelogram polyomino @xmath12 of size @xmath20 whose interior is divided into @xmath20 blocks as follows : one block is the topmost row ( resp .",

    "again , we have performed all computations with maple .",
    "we start by considering the succession rule   for @xmath129-row - restricted slicings . in this case",
    ", it simplifies into : @xmath232 note that it is not the same as rule  .",
    "we translate rule   into a system of functional equations as explained above , and substitute @xmath233 , obtaining : @xmath234 to solve this system , we express @xmath235 in terms of @xmath236 using the first equation , and replace @xmath237 and @xmath238 in the second equation by their expressions so obtained .",
    "we can then solve the second equation for @xmath239 using the kernel method , and deduce @xmath240 from the first equation .",
    "the generating function of @xmath129-row - restricted slicings is just the sum @xmath241 .",

    "when it comes to @xmath45-row - restricted slicings for general @xmath45 , the same questions as for @xmath45-skinny slicings can be asked : can their generating functions be computed from the system of functional equations derived from rule  ? or can the nature of these generating functions be derived ?",
    "we believe our results and the questions left open demonstrate that slicings of parallelogram polyominoes have a rich combinatorics yet to explore .",
    "we hope to contribute to this study in future work .",
    "we also ask whether similar interesting phenomena may happen when `` slicing '' other families of polyominoes .",
