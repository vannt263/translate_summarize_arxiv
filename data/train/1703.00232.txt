    "this paper deals with a novel construction that associates an integrable , tau - symmetric hierarchy and its quantization to a cohomological field theory on the moduli space of stable curves @xmath1 , without the semisimplicity assumption which is needed for the dubrovin - zhang hierarchy .",
    "it is inspired by eliashberg , givental and hofer s symplectic field theory @xcite and is the fruit of a joint project of the author with a. buryak and , more recently , with j. gur and b. dubrovin .",
    "+ since the construction makes explicit use of the intersection theory of the double ramification cycle , we call this hierarchy the double ramification ( dr ) hierarchy .",
    "it was in fact a. buryak who introduced its classical version in @xcite , where he also explicitly computed the first two examples ( the classical dr hierarchies of the trivial and hodge cohfts , corresponding to the kdv and intermediate long wave hierarchies ) , thereby showing the interest and power of this technique .",
    "+ its properties , quantization and relation with the dz hiearchy were studied and clarified in the series of joint papers @xcite , partly guided by our previous investigations of the classical and quantum integrable systems arising in sft @xcite .",
    "+ the dr hierarchy has many interesting properties and even advantages over the more classical dubrovin - zhang hierarchy , including a much more direct access to the explicit form of the hamiltonians and poisson structure , a natural and completely general technique to quantize the integrable systems thus produced , recursion relations for the hamiltonians that are reminiscent of genus @xmath2 trrs in gromov - witten theory but work at all genera . when dubrovin proposed to me to work on a thesis on integrable systems arising in sft , back in 2004 , he said he believed that was the actual correct approach to integrable hierarchies from moduli spaces of curves .",
    "i believe that prediction has found complete confirmation in the power of the dr hierarchy project .",
    "+ finally , one of the main parts of this project is the proof of the conjecture ( originally proposed in a weaker form by a. buryak ) that the dz and dr hierarchies for a semisimple cohft are in fact equivalent under a change of coordinates that preserves their tau - symmetry property ( a normal miura transformation ) , and which we completely identified in @xcite .",
    "while the general proof of such conjecture is the object of an ongoing work , we managed to show its validity in a number of examples and classes of interesting special cases .",
    "our present approach to the general statement reduces it to proving a finite number of relations in the tautological ring of each @xmath1 with @xmath3 .",
    "+ after a self contained introduction to the language of integrable systems in the formal loop space and the needed notions from the geometry of the moduli space of stable curves we will explain the double ramification hierarchy construction and present its main features , with an accent on the quantization procedure , concluding with a list of examples worked out in detail . + * acknowledgements .",

    "in this section i will try to give , in a few pages , a precise idea of what an integrable system is , in the context of evolutionary hamiltonian pdes .",
    "we will introduce the minimal notions that will be used in what follows and assume a certain familiarity with the finite dimensional theory of poisson manifolds , to guide the reader in extending such notions to an infinite - dimensional context .",

    "this is just a heuristic interpretation as we choose to work in a more formal algebraic setting by describing an appropriate ring of functions for the loop space of @xmath10 as follows .",

    "its importance lies in the fact that we can use the parameter @xmath20 to invert such change of coordinates : for fixed @xmath33 , we just need to solve the ode @xmath34 for the functions @xmath30 order by order in @xmath20 and we will obtain a differential polynomial @xmath35 . the resulting group is called the miura group . +",
    "differential polynomials and local functionals can also be described using another set of formal variables , corresponding heuristically to the fourier components @xmath36 , @xmath37 , of the functions @xmath15 .",

    "given that the variational derivative @xmath51 is the natural extension to local functionals of the finite dimensional notion of partial derivative , the above formula seems quite natural .",
