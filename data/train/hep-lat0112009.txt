    "simulation studies of nambu - jona lasinio models have proven to be much more quantitative than those of other field theories @xcite .",
    "in particular , the logarithmic triviality of these models has been demonstrated , although determining logarithmic singularities decorating mean field scaling laws is a daunting numerical challenge .",
    "the reason for this success lies in the fact that when one formulates these four fermi models in a fashion suitable for simulations , one introduces an auxiliary scalar field @xmath3 in order to write the fermion terms of the action as a quadratic form . in this formulation @xmath3 then acts as a chiral order parameter which receives a vacuum expectation value , proportional to the chiral condensate @xmath4 , in the chirally broken phase .",
    "most importantly , the auxiliary scalar field @xmath3 becomes the dynamical mass term in the quark propagator .",
    "the dirac operator is now not singular for quarks with vanishing bare mass and its inversion @xcite , @xcite is successful and very fast .",
    "the algorithm for nambu - jona lasinio models is `` smart ''  it incorporates a potential feature of the solution of the field theory , chiral symmetry breaking and a dynamical fermion mass , into the field configuration generator .    the good features of the simulation algorithm for the nambu - jona lasinio model can be generalized to lattice qcd @xcite and qed @xcite by incorporating a weak four fermi term in their actions .",
    "these generalized models now depend on two couplings , the familiar gauge coupling and a new four fermi coupling . by choosing the four fermi coupling small",
    "we can be confident that all the dynamics resides in the gauge and fermi fields and the four fermi term just provides the framework for an improved algorithm which allows us to simulate the chiral limit of massless quarks directly .",
    "we shall find a line of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry transition points in the two dimensional coupling constant parameter space of the u(1)-gauged nambu - jona lasinio model . by simulating the model at several regions along the transition line",
    ", we will see that the theory is logarithmically trivial and that the four fermi term is irrelevant in the continuum limit .",
    "our conclusions will be supported by fits with very high confidence levels .",
    "because of the irrelevance of the pure four fermi interaction , this model will make `` textbook '' qed accessible and this paper will address the classic problem of whether qed suffers from complete charge screening .",
    "our measurements will show that the theory is logarithmically trivial and the systematics of the logarithms of triviality follow those of the nambu - jona lasinio model rather than the scalar @xmath5 model as usually assumed .    simulating",
    "the @xmath6 case directly has substantial advantages , both theoretical and practical .",
    "when @xmath7 is set to zero , the theory has the exact chiral symmetry of the interaction terms in the action and this forbids chiral symmetry breaking counterterms from appearing in its effective action .",
    "this simplicity can lead to a large scaling window in the direction of the gauge or four fermi coupling in the theory s parameter space .",
    "our simulation results will support this point .",
    "however , when @xmath7 is not zero , as in most past studies of lattice qed and qcd , the effective action has no protection from dangerous symmetry breaking counterterms .",
    "in fact we will find that the scaling window of the lattice theory in the @xmath7-direction is very small and this fact is responsible for the failure of past approaches to lattice qed to address the question of triviality in a straightforward , convincing fashion . in fact , @xcite claimed non - triviality for the theory while @xcite found triviality and backed up their claim further in @xcite by calculating the sign of the beta function , which is directly relevant to the question of triviality .",
    "in addition , we shall check that the algorithm used in this work generates gauge field configurations for couplings near the chiral transition line which are free of lattice artifacts , such as monopoles @xcite and dirac strings , etc .    in this paper",
    "we will present data and analyses .",
    "preliminary results have already appeared in letter form @xcite , but this article will contain new data , analyses and discussions .",
    "other applications of the use of a four fermi term to speed lattice gauge theory simulations are also under development and are being applied to qcd @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that in these applications the strength of the four fermi term is weak , so it is not responsible for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it just acts as scaffolding which leads to an algorithm that converges efficiently in the limit of massless quarks .",
    "the dynamics resides in the gauge and fermion field interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the formulation of the lattice action and discuss its symmetries and general features . in the third section we test the algorithm and",
    "tune its parameters . in the next three sections we present data and analyses over a range of gauge couplings for three choices of the irrelevant four fermi coupling on @xmath1 lattices .",
    "the irrelevance of the four fermi coupling is demonstated explicitly and equation of state fits are presented which show that the theory is logarithmically trivial with the same systematics as the nambu - jona lasinio model .",
    "the confidence levels of these fits range from approximately @xmath8 to @xmath9 percent .",
    "analyses of the order parameter s susceptibility reinforce our conclusions . in the seventh section",
    "we consider simulations at nonzero bare fermion masses in order to make contact with past work on pure lattice qed .",
    "we find that subdominant scaling terms are needed to fit the data .",
    "in other words , the usual assumption that the scaling window is wide enough to address the issue of triviality by simulating the model at nonzero fermion masses and fitting to a logarithmically improved mean field form is shown to be incorrect . in section eight",
    "we present data on lattices ranging in size from @xmath0 to @xmath2 to check that our data for the chiral condensate is not influenced significantly by finite size effects for the range of couplings used in the fits . in section nine",
    "we consider measurements of lattice monopole observables to check that they are not critical at the chiral transition points as long as the bare four fermi coupling is nonzero .",
    "in section ten we discuss the possible role of lattice artifacts in simulations of pure lattice qed and address some concerns in the literature .",
    "finally , in section eleven we suggest additional work in this field .",
    "we considered the @xmath10gauged nambu jona lasinio model with four species of fermions .",
    "the lagrangian for the continuum nambu - jona lasinio model is ,    @xmath11    the symmetries and other properties of @xmath12 have been discussed in @xcite and we refer the reader to that and related references for details",
    ". we will be brief here and just review a few conceptually important points .    the pure nambu - jona lasinio model ( eq",
    ". 1 . with @xmath13",
    "set to zero ) has been solved at large @xmath14 by gap equation methods @xcite , and an accurate simulation study of it has been presented @xcite .    the lattice action for eq .",
    "1 reads :    @xmath15    where @xmath16    where @xmath3 is an auxiliary scalar field defined on the sites of the dual lattice @xmath17 @xcite , and the symbol @xmath18 denotes the set of the 16 lattice sites surrounding the direct site @xmath19 .",
    "the factors @xmath20 are the gauge connections and @xmath21 are the staggered phases , the lattice analogs of the dirac matrices .",
    "@xmath22 is a staggered fermion field and @xmath7 is the bare fermion mass , which will be set to 0 .",
    "note that the lattice expression for @xmath23 is non - compact in the lattice field @xmath24 , while the gauge field couples to the fermion field through compact phase factors which guarantee local gauge invariance .",
    "this point will be discussed further in sec.10 below .",
    "interesting limiting cases of the above action are the pure @xmath25 nambu - jona lasinio model ( @xmath26 ) , which has a phase transition at @xmath27 @xcite and the pure lattice qed ( @xmath28 ) limit , whose chiral phase transition is near @xmath29 for four flavors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the pure qed ( @xmath28 ) model also has a monopole percolation transition which is probably coincident with its chiral transition at @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "past simulations of this lattice model have led to contradictory results @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since the gauged nambu - jona lasinio model can be simulated at @xmath6 for all gauge couplings , the results reported here will be much more precise and decisive than those of the pure lattice qed ( @xmath28 ) limit .",
    "we scanned the 2 dimensional parameter space ( @xmath31,@xmath32 ) using the hybrid molecular dynamics algorithm tuned for four continuum fermion species @xcite and measured the chiral condensate and monopole susceptibility as a function of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we found that as we increased @xmath32 and moved off the @xmath28 axis , the peak of the monopole susceptibility shifted from @xmath30 at @xmath28 to @xmath33 at large @xmath34 .",
    "by contrast the chiral transition point shifted to a larger @xmath31 than the monopole percolation transition for a given value of @xmath34 and became distinct from the monopole percolation point as soon as @xmath34 became nonzero , as shown in the phase diagram , fig.1 .",
    "before turning to physically interesting measurements , we should address some technical issues concerning the algorithm . unlike the hybrid monte carlo algorithm , the hybrid molecular dynamics algorithm is not exact .",
    "the molecular dynamics equations of motion can be found in the literature @xcite . in order to evolve the noisy equations of motion and generate an ensemble of field configurations , one must choose a monte carlo time step @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the discretization errors have been exhaustively studied and it has been shown that systematic errors in observables behave as @xmath36 @xcite . therefore , we must choose @xmath35 small enough that these systematic errors are no larger than the statistical errors we will encounter .    in table 1 and fig .",
    "2 we show the order parameter @xmath3 evaluated on a @xmath0 lattice at gauge coupling @xmath37 and four fermi coupling @xmath38 .",
    "( we write @xmath3 here as a shorthand for @xmath39 , the expectation value of the field .",
    "this is a standard notational shortcut which , hopefully , should nt lead to confusion . ) the table shows that as long as @xmath40 the systematic error in @xmath3 is negligible .",
    "the figure shows that the theoretically expected quadratic dependence of the systematic error on @xmath36 has been confirmed numerically .",
    "the error bars quoted in the table have been obtained using the usual binning techniques , so they reflect the correlations in the measurements .",
    "the last column of the table gives the number of trajectories in each data set .",
    "a trajectory here means an interval of one monte carlo time unit of the algorithm ( for @xmath41 a trajectory consists of one hundred sweeps ) . after each trajectory",
    "a single measurement of @xmath3 was made .",
    "most of our production runs were done using @xmath42 . particularly close to the critical point where these systematiic errors are most dangerous",
    ", we checked our results with runs having @xmath43 .",
    "no problems were encountered .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we made accurate measurements on the chiral critical line for many choices of couplings ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and lattice sizes ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath2 . in this section",
    "we review our data collected varying @xmath44 at fixed @xmath38 on a @xmath1 lattice .",
    "a discussion and presentation of this data has appeared in @xcite , so we will be brief .    the data is presented in table 2 .",
    "the columns list the average values of @xmath3 , @xmath45 which is the longitudinal susceptibility of the order parameter @xcite , @xmath46 which is the monopole percolation order parameter and @xmath47 which is the susceptibility of the monopole order parameter @xcite .",
    "the monopole observables will be discussed later .",
    "the data for the order parameter was fit to a form which could accomodate either @xmath5 or nambu - jona lasinio triviality : @xmath48 , where the parameter @xmath49 , the critical point @xmath50 , the amplitude @xmath51 and the scale @xmath52 are determined by the fitting routine . recall that @xmath5 triviality gives @xmath53 and nambu - jona lasinio triviality gives @xmath54 . for the scaling window of gauge couplings",
    "@xmath31 between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we found the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 with a confidence level of 34 percent .",
    "the reader should consult the figures and discussison in @xcite for more detail and perspective .",
    "as will be discussed below in sec.9 , these simulations also measured topological observables for the system s vacuum and we confirmed that monopoles and related objects were critical near the chiral transition @xmath57 , @xmath38 .",
    "( we shall see there that the monopole percolation transition is very narrow and occurs at @xmath61 for @xmath38 . )",
    "are other fitting forms possible for this data ?",
    "this is certainly true , of course .",
    "the point we are making , however , is that log - improved mean field theory fits the data with very high confidence levels and there are compelling theoretical reasons for it .",
    "the data and the fits support the conventional wisdom that qed is a trivial field theory and that the logarithms of triviality follow the systematics of the nambu - jona lasinio model rather than the scalar @xmath5 model .",
    "this last point is different from that usually assumed .",
    "in retrospect , it is very plausible that the nambu - jona lasinio model represents the triviality of qed better than @xmath5 , but the differences between the two models have not been emphasized or appreciated in the past .",
    "let s end our discussion of @xmath3 with some examples of other fits .",
    "simple power laws are the first ones to try . for example , a fit of the form @xmath62 is expected to work rather well with @xmath63 slightly larger than @xmath64 since the nambu - jona lasinio fits have worked so well . if we choose the range of @xmath31 to extend from @xmath65 to @xmath56 , we find @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , but the confidence level is very poor , ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "if we accept only a smaller range of couplings closer to the critical point , @xmath31 extending from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , the quality of the fit improves ( @xmath70 , confidence level of @xmath71 percent ) while the critical index @xmath63 rises to @xmath72 .",
    "this is the trend we find in the data : powerlaw estimates of the critical index @xmath63 increase as the range of couplings is restricted closer and closer to the critical coupling .",
    "this systematic drift in the fitting results suggests that a simple power is not an adequate representation of the full data set , but is simply mocking up the logarithm of the nambu - jona lasinio fit , which has a higher confidence level and is stable as different ranges of @xmath31 are considered .",
    "in @xcite we also analyzed the susceptibility associated with @xmath3 .",
    "in mean field theory , the singular piece of the longitudinal susceptibility @xmath73 diverges at the critical point @xmath50 as @xmath74 , @xmath75 , as @xmath76 approaches zero from above in the broken phase , and as @xmath77 in the symmetric phase @xcite .",
    "the critical index @xmath78 is exactly unity in mean field theory .    in logarithmically trivial models",
    "@xmath78 remains unity , but the amplitudes @xmath79 and @xmath80 develop weak logarithmic dependences @xcite . in the two component @xmath5 model , @xmath81 , while in the @xmath25 nambu - jona lasinio model , @xmath82 @xcite , where the scale @xmath52 comes from the order parameter fit .",
    "constrained linear fits to the data @xcite produced the amplitude ratio @xmath83 . since @xmath3 varies from @xmath84 to @xmath85 over the @xmath31 range @xmath55 - @xmath56 of the scaling window in the broken phase , the logarithm in the theoretical prediction of the nambu - jona lasinio model states that @xmath86 should range from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "again , the agreement between the simulation data and theory is very good .",
    "we find no support for the approximate analytic schemes discussed in @xcite which predicted that gauged @xmath89 nambu - jona lasinio models with a four fermi term with continuous chiral symmetry are nontrivial , have powerlaw critical singularities with indices that vary continuously with the couplings @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "additional simulations in sec.5 and 6 below will give strong evidence for the irrelevance of the four fermi term contrary to the results of @xcite .",
    "the reader should recall that truncated @xmath89 nambu - jona lasinio models which account for only restricted sets of feynman diagrams produce nontrivial `` theories '' with critical indices that vary continuously as @xmath31 and @xmath32 are varied .",
    "for example , this occurs if only `` rainbow graphs '' of gauged nambu - jona lasinio models are summed @xcite .",
    "some of these exercises may be relevant to technicolor model building .    on the basis of the work here",
    ", however , we suspect that when fermion vacuum polarization is accounted for , one would find complete charge screening and every gauged nambu - jona lasinio model based on continuum noncompact @xmath89 gauge dynamics would be trivial for all couplings .",
    "we suspect that nontriviality and lines of nontrivial field theories are aspects of truncation procedures only .",
    "we suspect , on the basis of the present work and past triviality investigations in scalar qed @xcite , that only models with dynamics beyond continuum noncompact @xmath89 gauge fields and fermions can be nontrivial and have a renormalization group fixed point at nonzero gauge coupling .",
    "an example might be afforded by @xmath89 theories with fundamental monopoles @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider new data collected varying @xmath91 at fixed @xmath90 on a @xmath1 lattice .",
    "the purpose of this series of simulations is to 1 . to verify that the four fermi coupling is irrelevant , and 2 . to accumulate more evidence that the theory is logarithmically trivial in the sense of the nambu - jona lasinio model .",
    "the data is presented in table 3 in the same format as table 2 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the data for the chiral condensate @xmath3 , at fixed @xmath90 and variable @xmath31 .",
    "we use the same fitting procedures as used in sec.4 : @xmath48 , where the parameter @xmath49 , the critical point @xmath50 , the amplitude @xmath51 and the scale @xmath52 are determined by the fitting routine . for the scaling window of gauge couplings @xmath31 between @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we found the parameters @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 with a confidence level of 87 percent .",
    "this excellent fit is the one shown in the figure .",
    "note that eight data points for @xmath31 between @xmath98 and @xmath99 were used in the fit while the figure has two additional points at stronger coupling .",
    "those points lie slightly below the fit , are slightly outside the scaling window and show the extent of the scaling window .",
    "we plot the eight data points between @xmath31 of @xmath98 and @xmath99 and the fit as shown in fig.4 .",
    ", @xmath100 vs. @xmath101 to illustrate the importance and numerical significance of the logarithm .",
    "the dashed line is the previous fit redrawn in this format , where we have zoomed in on the scaling window for emphasis .",
    "clearly this fit is stable to further cuts on the data set since all the data points lie on the fit .",
    "we conclude that nambu - jona lasinio triviality accommodates the lattice data at @xmath90 with very good confidence levels .",
    "this success also shows the irrelevance of the four fermi term in the lattice action : the scaling law for the order parameter is the same as that at the larger @xmath32 value although the lattice parameters , such as the location of the critical point , have changed .",
    "next , in fig.5 we show the inverse of the longitudinal susceptibility of the auxiliary field @xmath3 at fixed @xmath90 and variable @xmath31 .",
    "we follow the same procedures as used in sec.4 to analyze and plot the data here .",
    "the plot picks out a critical point @xmath102 and is consistent with the mean field value of the critical index @xmath103 .",
    "the constrained linear fits determine the amplitude ratio , @xmath104 . since @xmath3 varies from @xmath105 to @xmath106 over the @xmath31 range @xmath92 - @xmath93 of the scaling window in the broken phase , the logarithms in the theoretical prediction of the nambu - jona lasinio model for the amplitude ratio predict that @xmath86 should range from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "again , the agreement between the simulation data and theory is good , but is not comparable in quality or decisiveness to our other fits .",
    "in this section we consider new data collected varying @xmath108 at fixed @xmath107 on a @xmath1 lattice . in this case",
    "the four fermi coupling is four times stronger than the data discussed in the previous section , but far too weak to cause chiral symmetry breaking in the absence of the gauge coupling .",
    "the analysis and plots here are identical to the previous discussions of @xmath38 and @xmath90 , so we will be brief .",
    "the data is presented in table 4 in the same format as table 1 .",

    "@xmath31 between @xmath109 and @xmath110 , we found the parameters @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 with a confidence level of 99.9 percent .",
    "this impressive fit is the one shown in the figure .",

    "the dashed line is the previous fit redrawn in this format .",
    "the success of this fit reiterates the irrelevance of the four fermi term : the scaling law for the order parameter is the same as that at the @xmath32 values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 although the lattice parameters , such as the location of the critical point , have changed .",
    "next , in fig.8 we show the inverse of the longitudinal susceptibility of the auxiliary field @xmath3 at fixed @xmath107 and variable @xmath31 .",
    "the plot picks out a critical point @xmath117 and the constrained linear fits to the data shown in the figure produced the amplitude ratio @xmath118 . which compares well to the theoretical prediction @xmath119 .",
    "again , the agreement between the simulation data and theory is good , but is not comparable in quality or decisiveness to our order parameter fits .",
    "past simulations of lattice qed had to be done at nonzero fermion mass @xcite .",
    "the standard algorithms fail to converge in the limit @xmath120 because the lattice dirac operator becomes singular in the chiral limit @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this algorithmic problem has led to indecisive results for lattice qed because of large statistical and systematic errors .",
    "it is interesting to use the algorithm of this paper to discover , assess and clarify the problems in past work in this field .",
    "we chose to do simulations at nonzero fermion mass at the critical coupling @xmath50 determined by our fits presented in the previous section . in this way we can look for the width of the scaling window in the @xmath7-direction in a particularly simple fashion .",
    "recall that at criticality the order parameter @xmath3 should scale with the fermion mass @xmath7 , an explicit symmetry breaking parameter , as    @xmath121    where the critical index @xmath122 should be @xmath123 in a logarithmically trivial theory and @xmath124 , the power of the logarithm should be @xmath125 for a @xmath5 theory and should be @xmath126 for a nambu - jona lasinio model @xcite . by accumulating data over a range of small @xmath7 values , we can look for the region where eq .",
    "6 might apply and determine the width of the scaling window .",
    "it is important to keep the number of variables and parameters to a minimum in this sort of investigation .",
    "this is the reason we work at criticality .",
    "the critical coupling has been determined to be @xmath127 in sec.4 .",
    "the data for the order parameter and its susceptibility are shown in table 5 for @xmath7 ranging from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "note that the statistics for this data set is particularly high as smaller and smaller @xmath7 values are considered and the critical point is approached .",
    "the error bars in @xmath3 recorded there account for critical slowing down which forced us to accumulate such high statistics .",
    "the statistics are at least an order of magnitude greater than those of past studies and produce @xmath3 values with errors ranging from @xmath64 percent to @xmath130 percent .",
    "we learned in past studies of the pure nambu - jona lasinio that small @xmath7 values , typically below @xmath131 , are needed to find a scaling window @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the dynamics is controlled by the gauge coupling which alone is driving chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the four fermi coupling is tiny and is not affecting the dynamics in a numerically significant fashion .",
    "therefore , the width of the scaling window must be determined anew from the data in table 5 .    in fig .",
    "9 we plot @xmath132 vs. @xmath7 in order to assess visually the relevance of the leading logarithm result eq",
    "the data clearly pick out the value @xmath133 for the dominant powerlaw singularity of the scaling law for very small @xmath7 values , all less than @xmath131 .",
    "however , we also see that the deviations from the mean field result are numerically significant over the entire mass range shown .",
    "in fact , they are far too large to be accommodated by a weak logarithmic scaling violation as expected in eq . 6 .",
    "in fact , a fit of that form to the data ranging from @xmath134 to @xmath135 produces a huge value for the power of the logarithm , @xmath136 , and a very small confidence level of @xmath137 percent ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "therefore , the data rule out the applicability of logarithmic improved mean field scaling to describe the data at nonzero @xmath7 except for the very smallest values of @xmath7 , @xmath139 .",
    "unfortunately , most data used to study the potential triviality of qed using the conventional action employed @xmath7 values considerably larger than @xmath140 in order to run efficiently and generate sufficient statistics .",
    "typical ranges of @xmath7 have been between @xmath131 and @xmath141 @xcite and are very sensitive to data taken with @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "this criticism applies to all past studies of noncompact qed , for example , @xcite .",
    "it also means that the methods of analysis introduced in @xcite do not apply to this data set because those methods require data in a scaling window , controlled by a single asymptotic form .",
    "higher precision data taken at the smallest values of @xmath7 , @xmath139 , are required apparently and , in fact , larger lattices than @xmath1 might be necessary also because of the possibility of significant finite size effects .",
    "two possible explanations for the data come to mind : 1 . perhaps the real critical point is significantly different from @xmath145 as determined by our fits at @xmath146 , or 2 .",
    "perhaps subdominant singularities in the scaling law are numerically significant over this range of @xmath7 .",
    "it is easy to rule out option 1 . ignoring logarithms ,",
    "the mean field equation of state reads @xmath147 .",
    "this implies that if @xmath31 were different from @xmath50 , then @xmath132 would behave as @xmath148 , and the correction term would be large for small @xmath3 , which is just the opposite of the behavior observed in fig .",
    "9 .    now consider option 2 .",
    "if a subdominant singularity contributes to the equation of state , then at criticality the relation @xmath149 should be replaced by ,    @xmath150    where @xmath122 should be @xmath123 and @xmath151 should be considerably larger @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis fits the data beautifully : the curved dashed line in fig .",
    "9 shows the fit which has a confidence level of @xmath152 percent ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "in fact this fitting form can be well approximated in a fashion that is useful for practical purposes ,    @xmath154    eq .",
    "8 approximates eq . 7 because the correction to the constancy of @xmath132 is less than @xmath155 percent over the range of @xmath7 values in the figure .",
    "the fit gives @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 .",
    "we learn several lessons from this exercise .",
    "previous simulations of pure qed at nonzero @xmath7 could not possibly have detected the logarithms of triviality decorating mean field singularities . for the present range of @xmath7 values and lattice sizes , data at nonzero @xmath7",
    "have contributions from subdominant critical singularities which are larger numerically than logarithmic corrections to mean field theory .",
    "since we are using a new algorithm which works in the limit of massless quarks , we should be careful to monitor finite size effects .",
    "some of our data are taken very near to critical points in order to find critical indices that control continuum limits of the lattice models . at these points",
    "the model s correlation length diverges and there are potentially dangerous finite size effects which could mimic finite temperature effects , for example . we need to check that the lattice is large enough to contain correlations larger than the lattice spacing but smaller than the system s spatial extent in order to work within a scaling window where we can extract continuum features of the field theory .    in table 6",
    "we show data for @xmath3 taken for gauge couplings @xmath31 ranging from @xmath159 to @xmath160 at fixed four fermi coupling @xmath161 for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 lattices .",
    "the comparison of the three data sets shows coincidence everywhere except at @xmath162 between the smallest lattice @xmath0 and the other two .",
    "@xmath162 was our closest approach to the critical point in the symmetry broken phase and it appears that our @xmath1 lattice was sufficient , given our @xmath64 percent statistical errors .",
    "reliance on a @xmath0 lattice would have failed us .    in the next table",
    "we show @xmath0 data for a simulation where the four fermi coupling is fixed at @xmath38 and @xmath31 ranges from @xmath159 to @xmath163 .",
    "the data consists of @xmath3 as well as monopole observables that will be discussed in a later section . comparing the @xmath3 data here to that in table 3 ,",
    "we confirm the absence of finite size effects within our statistical errors .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath1 data we have used to extract scaling laws from @xmath3 measurements appears free of significant finite size effects .",
    "the significance of finite size effects depends strongly on the observable being simulated .",
    "we also checked that the longitudinal susceptibility data that was used to extract the logarithmic violations of scaling in the amplitudes was not distorted by finite size effects .",
    "since these susceptibilities are determined with much larger statistical error bars , this test was less demanding .",
    "certainly the finite size effects in @xmath45 are much larger than those in @xmath3 itself . however , since @xmath3 was determined within a fraction of a percent while the statistical uncertainty in @xmath45 was typically several percent , a @xmath1 lattice was adequate for the range of couplings used in this study .",
    "noncompact lattice qed was first studied with the goal of simulating the dynamics of @xmath89 gauge fields without the monopoles that accompany compact lattice qed @xcite .",
    "it was found , however , that even the noncompact formulation has monopole - like dislocations in its lattice formulation because of the space - time cutoff itself @xcite .",
    "these dislocations can undergo a percolation transition where long range correlations develop @xcite . because of this transition , it is not obvious that simulation results in pure noncompact lattice qed reflect the physics of textook qed in which field configurations are smooth and have no topological excitations .",
    "the formulation of noncompact lattice qed with a four fermi term is free of the issues raised in @xcite .",
    "the point is , as discussed in the section 2 above , the monopole percolation transition does not coincide with the chiral transition as long as the four fermi coupling is nonzero . therefore the gauge field vacuum is free of critical dislocations at the gauge couplings of interest , so we know that we are studying a model free of topological excitations , as we wish .",
    "let s find the monopole percolation transition in the model with a fixed four fermi coupling @xmath38 .",
    "the data for the monopole concentration @xmath46 and the associated monopole percolation susceptibility @xmath47 , both defined exactly as in @xcite , are given in table 2 .",
    "in fig.10 we plot the monopole concentration against the gauge coupling and find a percolation transition at @xmath164 .",
    "we determined in sec.4 that the chiral transition occurs at considerably weaker coupling , @xmath165 , where the monopole concentration is insignificant , as we read off fig.10 .",
    "it is also informative to confirm this conclusion by considering the monopole percolation susceptility , @xmath47 . in fig.11",
    "we plot this susceptibility against the gauge coupling and see that it appears to diverge in the vicinity of @xmath164 ( we also confirmed this impression with powerlaw fits ) .",
    "in addition , in fig.12 we plot the longitudinal susceptibility of the chiral transition and confirm that it diverges near @xmath165 , as already determined in sec.4 .",
    "the two susceptibility peaks are cleanly separated : @xmath164 vs. @xmath165 .",
    "we end this section with a minor remark about the finite size effects observed in the monopole observables . comparing table 2 and table 7",
    ", we see that as the monopole percolation transition s critical coupling is approached , there are numerically significant differences between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 data sets for both the concentration @xmath46 as well as its associated susceptibility @xmath47 .",
    "as expected , the percolation susceptibility @xmath47 is strongly suppressed by the lattice size near the transition . in fact , as we have discussed elsewhere @xcite , finite size scaling of the peak of the susceptibility is an effective and accurate means to measure the percolation critical indices .",
    "it would take simulations on a series of lattice sizes to carry out such a program for this model .",
    "the only point we wish to make here , however , is that the percolation and chiral transitions are well separated inside the phase diagram fig .",
    "it is interesting ( and fortunate for the success of this project ) that the finite size effects in the chiral order parameter @xmath3 are significantly smaller than those in the monopole concentration .",
    "although the major topic in this research is the behavior of the gauged nambu - jona lasinio model for @xmath167 , we will briefly discuss the present confusing state of theory and simulations at the edge of the phase diagram @xmath166 where past simulations have been carried out .",
    "as we have already emphasized , the real problem with studies at @xmath166 is that they must be done at nonzero fermion mass away from the chiral limit and this has caused several problems : 1 .",
    "the simulations become excessively slow for small @xmath7 values because the lattice dirac operator is singular in that limit . therefore , at low values of @xmath7 where the best statistics are required , the statistics of the data sets are typically the poorest .",
    "the scaling window in the @xmath7-direction is extremely narrow , so fitting forms which only account for the leading critical behavior are inadequate and misleading .",
    "attempting to go beyond leading order critical singularities in fits leads to a vast proliferation of parameters which undermines firm conclusions .",
    "another potential problem concerning the @xmath166 edge of the phase diagram concerns lattice monopoles .",
    "recall that one motivation for inventing and studying noncompact lattice qed @xcite was to make a model free of monopoles in order to understand the relation between chiral symmetry breaking and single gluon exchange .",
    "however , hands and wensley @xcite pointed out that even the the noncompact model has monopole - like lattice dislocations because of gauge invariance of the pure gauge field piece of the action and because of the lattice cutoff itself .",
    "these authors also pointed out that these lattice monopoles experience a percolation transition as the gauge coupling becomes strong and in the case of quenched simulations , the monopole percolation transition is very close to the chiral transition experienced by light fermions @xcite .",
    "this led these authors to speculate that noncompact lattice qed might not be a sound framework for studying `` textbook '' qed at strong coupling @xcite .    what does this possibility mean for this paper ?",
    "since we work at @xmath167 where the critical line of monopole percolation is distinct from the chiral transition line , these lattice artifacts are not relevant to our conclusions .",
    "we believe that we have a firm theoretical and numerical grasp of gauged nambu - jona lasinio models everywhere within the phase diagram fig.1 but not along the edge @xmath166",
    ". how could this be ?",
    "following hands and wensley , the gauge field piece of the action eq.2 is invariant under local gauge transformations defined by the group of real numbers @xmath168 , while the fermionic piece of the action , which describes the gauge invariant hopping of the fermion around the lattice , has a gauge symmetry based on phases , @xmath89 .",
    "the cutoff theory described by the pure gauge piece of the action has monopole excitations attached by dirac strings @xcite .",
    "these are singular field configurations whose actions diverge when the lattice spacing is taken to zero",
    ". they would be of no concern if it were nt for the fact that as the coupling increases they experience a percolation transition where monopole clusters develop macroscopic dimensions .",
    "since the fermions are sensitive to monopole clusters through their @xmath89 phase , hands and wensley speculated that they could affect the chiral transition in the quenched and unquenched model .",
    "this speculation could be wrong for several reasons : 1 .",
    "the underlying gauge action is just a quadratic form , so it is a perfectly solvable free field theory .",
    "a free field theory ca nt have a phase transition , as emphasized in @xcite and 2 .",
    "percolation transitions need not affect the bulk properties of the underlying field theory .",
    "many examples of this sort can be cited .",
    "these complaints can be answered in part : 1 .",
    "the phase transition of percolation is not in local observables constructed out of the gauge fields , but rather is in nonlocal matrix elements .",
    "it is not unusual in statistical mechanics to make models where non - local matrix elements experience phase transitions when the underlying local field theory has no transition itself .",
    "condensed matter physics provides many examples of enormous practical importance including , for example , the localization - delocalization transition of single electrons in background fields of varying degrees of disorder .",
    "the chiral transition is sensitive to loops of the @xmath89 phase and is of this type .",
    "2 . since fermions flip their chirality in the presence of monopoles , it is plausible that a percolating network of monopole - like excitations can induce chiral symmetry breaking in the bulk system . there is a possibility that the @xmath169 pure qed model has qualitatively different physics than that found anywhere within the phase diagram in fig.1 . only at the edge of the diagram",
    "would the percolating monopole - like excitations be critical where chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "only there are new degrees of freedom , percolating monopoles , relevant so only there could there be a new universality class",
    ". it might be that on the edge of the phase diagram , the chiral condensate is driven by monopole percolation and the chiral transition inherits a correlation length critical index @xmath170 from the percolating network and becomes the basis for a nontrivial field theory @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that as the number of fermions is varied , both the chiral and monopole percolation transitions move in unison @xcite .",
    "in addition , in unquenched models , such as the four flavor model on the edge of the phase diagram fig.1 , the fermions induce @xmath89 plaquette terms into the theory s action which can support conventional lattice monopoles @xcite .",
    "we have nothing to add to the pros and cons of these qualitative arguments .",
    "we hope that the physics issues brought up here could be answered by striking out in new directions and finding approaches or arguments which are more precise and quantitative .",
    "the monopole percolation picture may contain only half truths , but some of those ideas might be testable in the context of models with real monopoles , generalizations of compact @xmath89 lattice qed @xcite , perhaps .",
    "we presented numerical evidence for the triviality of textbook qed using a new algorithm which converges for massless quarks .",
    "past simulations using the action with massive quarks but no four fermi term produced controversial results . recall that @xcite claimed non - triviality for the theory while @xcite found triviality and backed up their claim further in @xcite by calculating the sign of the beta function , which is directly relevant to the question of triviality .",
    "one could calculate the theory s renormalized couplings and their rg trajectories in the chiral limit , extending the work of @xcite to a two parameter space . both the gauge and the four fermi couplings should vanish as the reciprocal of the logarithm of the ultra - violet cutoff . as discussed in @xcite",
    "this calculation has some technical challenges specific to lattices of finite extent which necessitate the extrapolation of raw lattice data to achieve physical results",
    ". it would be worthwhile to investigate improved strategies here to avoid crude , indecisive results .",
    "the high quality of the equation of state fits in sec.4 , 5 and 6 should lead to improved determinations of the renormalized couplings because the lattice critical couplings are determined with excellent precision .",
    "one could also simulate the model with the @xmath25 chiral group replaced by a continuous group so the model would have goldstone bosons even on a coarse lattice @xcite .",
    "it would then be possible to test the approach and results of @xcite more quantitatively .",
    "it would also be interesting to generalize the results of sec.7 , that a subdominant critical singularity is needed to describe the data at nonzero @xmath7 , away from the critical coupling .",
    "in other words , fit the finite @xmath7 data points of previous investigations such as @xcite to equations of state with both a dominant and subdominant singularity and check that improved confidence levels are achieved with simple hypotheses .",
    "unfortunately , there will be a proliferation of fitting parameters in such a program , so its numerical significance might be questioned .",
    "nonetheless , it would definitely be worth consideration .",
    "such a program would also influence the determination of renormalized couplings because these calculations use critical couplings inferred from equation of state fits @xcite .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to simulate compact qed with a small four fermi term and study the interplay of monopoles , charges and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "since the @xmath171 limit of the compact model is known to have a first order transition @xcite , generalizations of the action will be needed to find a continuous transition where a continuum limit of the lattice theory might exist .",
    "since the parameter space of the generalized model would be at least three dimensional , this interesting problem would be quite challenging .",

    "<S> by adding a small , irrelevant four fermi interaction to the action of noncompact lattice quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the theory can be simulated with massless quarks in a vacuum free of lattice monopoles . </S>",
    "<S> simulations directly in the chiral limit of massless quarks are done with high statistics on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 lattices at a wide range of couplings with good control over finite size effects , systematic and statistical errors . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice theory possesses a second order chiral phase transition which we show is logarithmically trivial , with the same systematics as the nambu - jona lasinio model . </S>",
    "<S> the irrelevance of the four fermi coupling is established numerically . </S>",
    "<S> our fits have excellent numerical confidence levels . </S>",
    "<S> the widths of the scaling windows are examined in both the coupling constant and bare fermion mass directions in parameter space . for vanishing fermion mass </S>",
    "<S> we find a broad scaling window in coupling which is essential to the quality of our fits and conclusions . by adding a small bare fermion mass to the action we find that the width of the scaling window in the fermion mass direction is very narrow . </S>",
    "<S> only when a subdominant scaling term is added to the leading term of the equation of state are adequate fits to the data possible . </S>",
    "<S> the failure of past studies of lattice qed to produce equation of state fits with adequate confidence levels to seriously address the question of triviality is explained . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum state of the lattice model is probed for topological excitations , such as lattice monopoles and dirac strings , and these objects are shown to be non - critical along the chiral transition line as long as the four fermi coupling is nonzero . </S>",
