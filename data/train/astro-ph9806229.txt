    "multifrequency campaigns ( e.g. courvoisier et al . 1987 ) showed that the broad band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is rather complex , with two clear peaks at uv ( @xmath5 ev ) and @xmath6ray ( @xmath7 mev ) energies ( ramos et al .",

    "part of the accretion disk thermal emission could be comptonized in an accretion disk corona ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , or in the hot two temperature inner disk region , along the line originally proposed by shapiro , lightman & eardly ( 1976 ) , and more recently by chakrabarty & titarchuk ( 1995 ) .    the first detection in the x  ray band was obtained by bowyer et al .

    "as shown in table  [ tab : broad - band - fits ] , a single absorbed power law is an acceptable representation of the data for observations a and c , it is marginally consistent with data set d , while it is rejected at 99.9% level in observation b. visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio - all ] shows that large scatter is present in the pds data , which also appear to be systematically steeper than the mecs data .",
    "a feature around @xmath58 kev is present in the lecs data .",
    "it is worth noting that , though the relative lecs / mecs and pds / mecs normalizations are marginally consistent with the fiducial ranges as given by the sdc ( 0.70.75 and 0.80.85 , respectively ) , the lecs / mecs ratio possibly varies among different datasets .",
    "one should be careful in interpreting variations of the lecs / mecs normalization ratio , as the presence of the strongback and of a support grid structure in the lecs window can actually affect such quantity ( parmar et al .",
    "recently , an in  flight raster scan of the central @xmath59 area of the lecs and mecs detectors ( 14 short observations of lmcx1 ) has allowed to map the lecs / mecs count ratio in the 28 kev band as a function of the position of the source in the lecs field of view .",
    "the scan has shown that the lecs / mecs ratio can decrease by about 22@xmath60 across the detector ( ricci 1998 , private comunication ) . however , such effect occurs when the centroid of the source lies at least at @xmath61 from the lecs center . since 3c 273 was always in the center of the field of view during the ao1 observations , and the positions of the source centroid do not differ by more than @xmath62 , it is unlikely that window support obscuration affects the lecs / mecs ratio in our datasets .",
    "nevertheless we must stress that fiducial values apply only under the assumption that the fitted model is a good description of the data throughout all the three instruments .",
    "if the model fails to describe the data in one of the instruments , this affects the resulting value of the inter ",
    "calibration parameter .",
    "we therefore conclude that a single power law , which is essentially determined by the mecs statistics , is not a good description of the data in the lecs and pds instrument ranges .",

    "it worths noting that no optical variability at a level larger than a few percent has been detected during the monitoring .",
    "as reported in the previous section , the ao1 data are only marginally consistent with a simple single power law model with galactic absorption . there are ( admittedly weak ) indications of features , namely iron emission line and a high energy curvature of the _ beppo_sax  spectra .",
    "more importantly , the presence of these same ( but stronger ) features , absorption around 0.6 kev , and a soft excess component at very soft energies during the weakest svp state , lead us to consider a more complex underlying ( variable ) emission model .",
    "in particular , it has been already ( qualitatively ) suggested ( see references in the introduction , cappi et al .",
    "1998 ) that an iron emission line in the spectra of radio  loud quasars might indicate that the x  ray emission comprises two components : a seyfert  like thermal x  ray spectrum , characterized by features induced by reflection over optically thick cold material subtending @xmath152 to the ` primary ' source , and a flat non  thermal component , arising as emission from plasma moving at relativistic speed in the jet , as typical of radio  loud objects .",
    "we therefore modelled the data with a complex model , consisting in the sum of a constant ` thermal ' component and a variable non  thermal power law .",
    "clearly our aim is _ not _ to obtain a significantly better fit for the ao1 data , but rather to determine whether the variations in the observed features between the different observations are consistent with the scenario of an accreting object which dissipates energy in an accretion disc and its corona but where also a powerful jet is formed producing extremely variable beamed emission .",
    "the thermal spectrum has been represented by parameters typical of seyfert spectra ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 ) with a primary @xmath153 power ",
    "law emission impinging on cold matter subtending a 2@xmath154 solid angle , giving rise to an iron line at 6.4 kev ( source frame ) with an ew of 150 ev . in order to establish the absolute normalization of the thermal component , we considered the svp data .",
    "the flux of the underlying seyfert  like spectrum is determined by the simple requirement that the intrinsic 150 ev of the iron line ew are observed , once diluted by the non  thermal component , as @xmath155 ev .",
    "this sets the flux of the seyfert  like component at 6.4 kev ( source frame ) in the svp to be 1/5 of the svp total observed flux at this energy .",
    "we then assume that such flux level characterizes the seyfert  like component in all the source states , i.e. the seyfert  like component did not change among svp and ao1 data .",
    "in other words , we test the hypothesis that all of the spectral differences observed among svp and ao1 observations are accounted for by the variable non  thermal component .",
    "the latter has been modelled as a power  law with a ( parabolic ) turnover , to mimic the cutoff around a few mev , detected in the @xmath156ray data ( e.g. mcnaron  brown et al .",

    "the edge is reasonably well constrained by the data at e@xmath183 kev with an optical depth @xmath184 .",

    "the beamed component turns out to have @xmath188 , fully consistent with spectral indices detected in the brightest states of this source , when the non  thermal emission is likely to completely dominate the x  ray flux .",
    "in particular , we considered the recent results from asca by cappi et al .",
    "the uncertainties in the calibration discussed by cappi et al .",
    "do not allow a quantitative comparison with the _ beppo_sax  results ( see e.g. the discussion about the iron line ew by these authors ) .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the model is also qualitatively consistent with the asca results , in particular with the hardening of the 210 kev spectrum as the source gets brighter .",
    "the curved shape of the non  thermal continuum nicely accounts for the observed steep spectral index in the pds range ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : indices ] ) .",
    "the quality of the fit is rather insensitive to the energy of the peak of the parabolic component , and good fits are compatible with the power law starting steepening at energies above the mecs range and peaking around a few mev .",
    "the values reported in table  [ tab : fit_modellone ] are obtained with the peak of the parabolic component fixed at 2 mev .",
    "our results show that _ beppo_sax  observations of 3c 273 can be interpreted in a framework where the increase of the non  thermal emission in the ao1a swamps out the spectral features connected to the seyfert  like component , such as the soft - excess , the absorption edge and the iron line .",
    "moreover , it should be stressed that , in this model , the steep ` primary ' thermal emission in the svp state exceeds the non  thermal one at the lowest energies and naturally reproduces the steeper power law detected in the lecs energy range .",
    "the steepening of the higher energy spectrum observed in the ao1 data is simply interpreted as the curvature of the inverse compton emission reaching its peak .    once again",
    ", we stress that the model has not been constructed in order to best fit all the available data .",
    "the number of free parameters coupled with the data uncertainties would make this meaningless .",
    "note in particular that there is no reason why any thermal component should be constant and there is actually clear evidence for variability in the spectral slope ( e.g. , observation c in ao1 ) , with no apparent correlation with the source intensity .",
    "similar uncorrelated spectral variations have been also reported in exosat and ginga observations ( turner et al . 1990 ) .",
    "also , we can not exclude that the reflection hump is at a level lower than assumed ( i.e. , @xmath189 ) , as seems the case in broad emission line galaxies ( wozniak et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "however , from the fitting of the three states ( svp , low and high states of ao1 ) we conclude that seyfert  like emission from an accretion disk and its corona is likely present , roughly at comparable flux level with the highly variable beamed non  thermal emission from a relativistic jet .",
    "the model in fact well reproduces three _",
    "beppo_sax  observations and is consistent with the asca ones , by only allowing for a change in the normalization of the non  thermal emission .",
    "the results of _ beppo_sax  observations of 3c 273 performed in jan .",
    "1997 have been presented .",
    "the source varied within the observations and with respect to previous svp data .",
    "most notable is the variation of x  ray features clearly detected during the low state svp , and barely present in the ao1 data ( and qualitatively consistent with the asca results recently reported by cappi et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the variable strength of the observed spectral features is consistent with a spectrum consisting of x  ray emission by a typical seyfert  like nucleus , namely direct and reprocessed radiation dissipated in or above an optically thick accretion disk , and a variable non  thermal beamed component generated by the plasma moving in the relativistic jet .",
    "although the ao1 data could be satisfactorily modelled by a single power law , slightly steepening above @xmath5 kev , the comparison with the svp phase suggests that any thermal emission is indeed more evident in low source states ( corresponding to weaker non  thermal radiation ) .",
    "indeed the data available can be basically accounted for in this picture , by varying the absolute value of the normalization of the non  thermal emission . clearly ,",
    "monitoring of 3c 273 to derive variability information on the broad _",
    "beppo_sax  energy range will allow to develop a more consistent and detailed model .",
    "indications of thermal / seyfert  like emission in 3c 273 have been recognized for a long time , in different spectral bands , showing that in this source both thermal and non  thermal emission processes are taking place , with comparable radiative dissipation rate .",
