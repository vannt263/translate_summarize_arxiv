    "thermoelectric ( te ) materials can realize direct energy conversion between heat and electricity , and have many potential applications in power generation and heat pumping  @xcite . te performance is determined by a dimensionless figure of merit , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity , thermal conductivity , and absolute temperature , respectively .",
    "high te performance can be achieved in materials with large seebeck coefficient , high electrical conductivity , and low thermal conductivity .",
    "recently , layered bicuose has attracted considerable interests in te applications , because it exhibits very low intrinsic thermal conductivity  @xcite . in the past few years",
    ", significant effort has been made to improve the @xmath8 value of bicuose . with doped various metal elements such as divalent mg , ca , sr , ba ,",
    "pb , and zn  @xcite , monovalent na , k , and ag  @xcite , and trivalent la  @xcite , and also with cu - deficient self - doping  @xcite , the electrical transport properties of bicuose could be improved remarkably , due to the increase in the concentration of carries .",
    "additionally , the anisotropic property of layered bicuose can help to enhance the @xmath8 value further . by hot - forging process , sui _",
    "el al _ obtained textured ba - doped bicuseo with a high @xmath8 of 1.4 at 923 k  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it was found that point defects arisen from doping  @xcite or vacancies in bicuose  @xcite could reduce its lattice thermal conductivity effectively .",
    "much research on the electronic structures and electronic carrier transport properties of bicuose has been done  @xcite .",
    "it is found that , similar to other good semiconductor te materials , bicuose has a narrow band gap of 0.750.8 ev  @xcite . in bicuose , there is a mixture of heavy and light bands near the valence band maximum  @xcite , which is beneficial for its good te performance , for that the light bands lead to high carriers mobility , and thus the high electrical conductivity , whereas the heavy bands result into a steeper density of states near the fermi level and thus to a higher seebeck coefficient  @xcite .",
    "the remarkable advantage of bicuose for te applications is its extraordinarily low lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "it is reported that the lattice thermal conductivity of non - textured bicuose is as low as 0.520.9 wm@xmath9k@xmath9 at 300 k  @xcite , which is much lower than that in state of the art bulk te materials of bi@xmath10te@xmath11 ( 1.6 wm@xmath9k@xmath9 at 300 k  @xcite ) or pbte ( 2.8 wm@xmath9k@xmath9 at 300 k  @xcite ) , and even lower than that in phonon - glass electron - crystal materials of clathrates or skutterudites  @xcite .",
    "recently , some studies on the origin of low thermal conductivity of bicuose have been conducted .",
    "et al _ have speculated that the weak chemical bonding and strong anharmonicity of bonding resulted in the low thermal conductivity  @xcite .",
    "saha has conducted a comparison study on the lattice dynamics between bicuose and lacuose , and ascribed the low thermal conductivity of bicuose to its constituent elements with high atomic mass  @xcite . however , the investigation on the phonon transport properties of bicuose is still relatively rare .",
    "recently , _",
    "ab initio _ calculation of lattice thermal conductivity has been developed by combining the first - principles calculations of interatomic force constants with solving the phonon boltzmann transport equation iteratively  @xcite .",
    "the first - principles calculations can accurately predict the phonon thermal conductivity without any assumption on phonon lifetimes , and capture the transport properties of each phonon , and have been used in the investigations of phonon transport properties for many materials  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present a detailed investigation of phonon transport property for bicuose to understand the physical mechanism of ultralow thermal conductivity and strong anisotropy in phonon transport .",
    "our calculations reproduce the lattice thermal conductivity of bicuose .",
    "the grneisen parameter , which measures the anharmonicity of bonding , is 2.4@xmath02.6 at room temperature , indicating a strong anharmonicity in bicuose .",
    "this leads to the low thermal conductivity .",
    "moreover , we find that the high - frequency optical phonons of bicuose contribute considerably to the total thermal conductivity , which is remarkably different from usual picture with little contribution from optical phonons",
    ". additionally , our calculations show that the obvious anisotropy of phonon conduction originates from the anisotropic sound velocities in bicuose .",
    "the calculations are based on density functional theory method in the generalized gradient approximation with the perdew , burke , and ernzerhof functional ( pbe )  @xcite , as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) , which employs a plane - wave basis  @xcite .",
    "the plane - wave energy cutoff is set to be 500.00 ev , and the electronic energy convergence is @xmath12 ev . during relaxations , the force convergence for ions is @xmath13 ev /  .",
    "the pbe functional overestimates the equilibrium volume , and then underestimates the bulk modulus and group velocity of phonons .",
    "the hybrid functionals could be more reliable to obtain the equilibrium volume  @xcite and the bulk modulus .",
    "we then employ hse06  @xcite to calculate the equilibrium lattice parameters and bulk modulus of bicuose , then estimate the errors by the pbe calculations .",
    "the phonon frequencies and velocities are calculated within the harmonic approximation .",
    "parlinski - li - kawazoe method , which is based on the supercell approach with finite displacement method as implemented in the phonopy package  @xcite , is employed to obtain the phonon dispersion , phonon density of states , and group velocities for bicuose . to obtain convergent phonon property , in the calculations of harmonic interatomic force constants ,",
    "a @xmath14 supercell of primitive cell containing 144 atoms is employed , and a @xmath15centered @xmath16 monkhorst - pack k - point mesh is used to sample the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "the phonon boltzmann transport equation solved iteratively as implemented in shengbte  @xcite is employed to study the phonon transport of bicuose .",
    "the phonon lifetime can be solved numerically with an iterative method .",
    "the zeroth - order solution corresponds to the relaxation time approximation .",
    "the rta can well describe the phonon conduction of some materials such as si and ge  @xcite , while it fails to predict the thermal conductivity of carbon - based materials such as graphene  @xcite .",
    "we also inspect how accurate the prediction by rta is for the thermal conductivity of bicuose .",
    "to get the three - phonon scattering matrix elements for calculating the phonon lifetimes , the third - order force constants should be calculated firstly . in shengbte ,",
    "the third - order force constants are calculated by a finite - difference supercell approach . for the force calculations ,",
    "a @xmath14 supercell of primitive cell containing 144 atoms is employed so that there is only negligible interaction between atoms in the center and at the boundary . to get convergent lattice thermal conductivity",
    ", we adopt the eighth nearest neighbors as the cutoff for third - order force interactions .",
    "and there is 716 supercells with displaced atoms needed to be calculated in vasp . during the calculations of force constants ,",
    "only the @xmath15 point is set for the k - point grid . and in the calculation of lattice thermal conductivity , a 15 @xmath17 15 @xmath17 9 q - point grid ( 180 inequivalent * q * points ) is employed .",
    "apart from three - phonon processes , the contribution to scattering probabilities from isotopic disorder can also be calculated in shengbte . after calculating the phonon lifetime ,",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity can be obtained by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the volume of primitive cell , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the cartesian components of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , or @xmath24 , @xmath25 is boltzmann constant , and @xmath26 is the bose - einstein distribution function .",
    ".calculated equilibrium lattice constants ( a and c in  ) , @xmath24 coordinates of bi and se atoms , bulk modulus ( b in gpa ) , and the pressure derivative of bulk modulus ( b ) along with the available experimental data at room temperature . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table:3 ]    because @xmath27 , to give a quantity estimation for the ratio of in - plane to out - of - plane gv , we calculate the bulk modulus @xmath28 along @xmath1 and @xmath2 axes .",
    "the elastic constants are calculated and tabulated in table  [ table:3 ] .",
    "the elastic constants satisfy all the born s mechanical stability criteria , indicating that the system of bicuose is in a mechanical stable state . using calculated elastic constants , the bulk and young s modulus can be obtained by voigt - reuss - hill approximations  @xcite .",
    "the obtained bulk modulus from the elastic constants is 76.2 gpa , which is very close to that calculated from fitting the birch - murnaghan s 3rd - order equation of state .",
    "the young s modulus is a measure of the stiffness of an elastic material , and reflects the strength of bonding in the covalent crystals .",
    "our calculated young s modulus of bicuose is @xmath29 gpa , which agrees well with the experimental results of @xmath30 gpa by pei _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . and the relatively small young s modulus indicates a totally weak covalent bonding in bicuose .",
    "as is known , the elastic constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 reflect the stiffness - to - uniaxial strains along the crystallographic @xmath1 and @xmath2 axes , respectively ,",
    "while the elastic constants @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are related to the elasticity in shape . from table  [ table:3 ] , the value of @xmath31 is much higher than @xmath32 , which means that bicuose is stiffer for strains along the @xmath1 axis than along the @xmath2 axis . furthermore , the ratio of bulk modulus along @xmath1 axis to that along @xmath2 axis can be calculated by  @xcite @xmath37 the obtained @xmath38=2.3 for bicuose , which shows strong anisotropy in elastic property . and this value is close to the ratio of @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , our calculations show that the strong anisotropy of lattice thermal conductivity in bicuose should be ascribed to its anisotropic velocities .",
    "the anisotropy of bulk modulus , which leads to anisotropic sound velocity in bicuose , reflects the layered structure of bicuose . and",
    "the relationship between such strong anisotropy and the layered structure and anisotropically chemical bonding in bicuose remains to be uncovered .",
    "in summary , we have employed first - principles calculations to investigate the phonon transport of bicuose .",
    "the obtained phonon lifetime of bicuose is mostly in the range from 0.1 ps to several ps , which is comparable to those of pbte .",
    "our calculations show that there is strong bonding anharmonicity in bicuose , which leads to its ultralow lattice thermal conductivities . due to the high group velocities and low scattering processes involved , the high - frequency optical modes make a considerable contribution to the total lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "the anisotropy of thermal conductivities is ascribed to the anisotropy of wave velocities along @xmath1 and @xmath2 axes , which may originate from the layered structure and anisotropic chemical bonding in bicuose .",
