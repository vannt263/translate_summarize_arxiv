    "it is well known that the coulomb interaction among 3__d _ _ electrons in transition  metal oxides ( tmo ) is substantially important , which induces peculiar properties , such as metal ",
    "insulator transition@xcite , colossal magnetoresistance@xcite and high critical temperature superconductivity@xcite .",
    "because the 5__d _ _ orbitals are highly extended compared to those in the 3__d _ _ systems , it is natural to expect that the electronic correlations are weak and have only negligible effect in the 5__d _ _ compounds .",
    "however , recent theoretical and experimental works have given the evidence on the importance of coulomb interactions here@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the spin ",
    "orbit coupling ( soc ) in the 5@xmath2 transition metal elements is expected to be strong due to the large atomic number@xcite .",
    "hence , due to the interplay of electron correlations and strong spin  orbit interactions , various anomalous electronic properties have been observed / proposed in the 5__d _ _ transition oxides , such as j@xmath3=1/2 mott statesr2iro4 - 1,sr2iro4 - 2 , giant magnetoelectric effect@xcite , high t@xmath4 superconductivity@xcite , weyl semimetal with fermi arcsweyl - semimetal , axion insulator with large magnetoelectric couplingaxion insulator ,  topological insulator@xcite , correlated metal@xcite , kitaev mode@xcite , etc .",
    "one class of the well studied 5__d _ _ compounds are the osmates pickett , naoso3 , cd2os2o7 - 1,cd2os2o7 , singh lsda , rbos2o6,banioso , kos2o6 dft , cd2os2o7 - 3,cd2os2o7 - 4,cd2os2o7 - 5 .",
    "for example , the physical properties of cd@xmath5os@xmath5o@xmath6 are quite intriguing .",
    "it has been found that cd@xmath7os@xmath5o@xmath6 is metallic at room temperatures , while undergoing a metal  insulator transition ( mit ) at about 230 k@xcite .",
    "experiments reveal that this mit is continuous and purely electronic .",
    "moreover , it is coincident with a magnetic  transition of antiferromagnetic ( afm )  character@xcite .",
    "therefore , experimentalists argue that cd@xmath5os@xmath5o@xmath6 is the first well  documented example of a pure slater transition@xcite . however , despite of the vast efforts devoted@xcite , its exact magnetic ground state configuration is still unknown due to the strong geometric frustration of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "therefore , theoretical evidence of the slater transition in this compound is still lacking .    recently , using high pressure technique , shi _ _ et al.__@xcite synthesized another osmate : naoso@xmath0 . similar to cd@xmath5os@xmath5o@xmath6",
    ", naoso@xmath0 also exhibits a temperature  induced mit , which is again accompanied by a magnetic ordering without any lattice distortionnaoso3 .",
    "however , better than cd@xmath5os@xmath5o@xmath6 , naoso@xmath0 has a simple perovskite structure , consequently being free from the complication induced by magnetic frustration .",
    "therefore , naoso@xmath0  provides a unique platform to understand the temperature  induced and magnetic  related mit .",
    "based on the experimental crystal structure , shi _ _ et al.__@xcite also perform the band - structure calculation for this compound .",
    "theynaoso3 find that both lda  and lda+so calculation give the paramagnetic solution .",
    "their numerical results@xcite show that coulomb u  is not efficient , and antiferromagnetic correlation is essential to open the band gap@xcite .",
    "recently , there are experimental and theoretical evidences of the importance of electronic correlation and spin - orbital coupling in 5d transition - metal compounds",
    ". therefore a comprehensive investigation of the effect of the coulomb interaction , soc and magnetic order on its electronic structure and mit is still an interesting problem which we address in the present work .",
    "the electronic band structure calculations have been carried out by using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave  method as implemented in wien2k package@xcite . local spin density approximation ( lsda )",
    "is widely used for various 4@xmath2 and 5@xmath2 transition metal oxidessr2iro4 - 1,sr2iro4 - 2,lsda - good-1,lsda - good-2,kos2o6 dft , and we therefore adopt it as the exchange  correlation potential . the muffin ",
    "tin radii for na , os and o are set to 1.13 , 1.02 , and 0.90  , respectively .",
    "the basic functions are expanded to r@xmath8k@xmath9=7 ( where r@xmath8 is the smallest of the muffin - tin sphere radii and k@xmath9 is the largest reciprocal lattice vector used in the plane wave expansion ) , corresponding to 1915 lapw functions at the @xmath10  point . using the second  order variational procedure@xcite",
    ", we include the spin  orbital coupling interaction ( soc ) , which has been found to play an important role in the 5__d _ _ system@xcite .",
    "a 10@xmath116@xmath1110 mesh is used for the brillouin zone integral .",
    "the self  consistent calculations are considered to be converged when the difference in the total energy of the crystal does not exceed 0.1 mry and that in the total electronic charge does not exceed 10@xmath12 electronic charge at consecutive steps .",
    ".numerical and experimental internal coordinates of naoso@xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     on the other hand , the non  zero coulomb interaction _ u _ of os 5__d _ _ is found to stabilize the afm configuration .",
    "our calculation confirms that the magnetic order has a significant effect , and for a reasonable _ u _",
    "( @xmath132.0 ev ) , g  afm configuration  is the only insulating solution as shown in fig.3 .",
    "moreover , regardless the value of _ u _ , the g  afm configuration always has the lowest total energy .",
    "thus we believe g  afm configuration is the magnetic ordering state observed by the experiment @xcite . with increasing _",
    "u _ the band structure will change , but only when _ u _ is larger than 1.0 ev , the g  afm solution becomes insulating .",
    "the dos from u=1.0 ev ( see the fig.4c of ref.21 ) is similar with that from u=2.0 ev ( see fig.3b of present work ) , which again indicates that the coulomb u is not efficient to open the band gap .",
    "it is found that the magnetic moment is mainly located at os site , and despite of strong hybridization between os 5__d _ _ and o _ _",
    "2p _ _ , o site is basically non  magnetic ( less than 0.003 @xmath14 ) .",
    "the numerical data for _ _ u__=2.0 ev are given in table ii .",
    "for the 5__d__@xmath15 electronic systems such as bairo@xmath0 , sr@xmath5iro@xmath16 , pyrochlore iridates etc , it has been found that due to the strong spin ",
    "orbit entanglement in 5__d _ _ states , the magnetic orbital moment is about twice larger than the spin momentsr2iro4 - 1,sr2iro4 - 2,weyl - semimetal , orb moment in bairo3 , even in the presence of strong crystal field and band effects .",
    "contrary to 5__d__@xmath17 systems , the obtained orbital moment for naoso@xmath0 is much smaller than its spin moment , showing again that soc effect is small for this 5__d__@xmath18 electronic configuration case . as shown in table ii ,",
    "the magnitude of magnetic moment is sensitive to the magnetic configuration , indicating the itinerant nature of magnetism . for the same _ u _ value , the g ",
    "afm  configuration always has the largest magnetic moment among the considered states . however , as shown in table ii , our numerical magnetic moment ( 0.83 @xmath14 ) is much smaller than the experimental onenaoso3 .",
    "for an itinerant magnet , one may still fit the @xmath19  curve by the curie ",
    "weiss law , but can not estimate the magnetic moment accurately based on the curie  weiss constant@xcite .",
    "thus , the experimental magnetic moment may not be reliable .",
    "the energy difference between various magnetic configurations is large , which is consistent with the observed high magnetic transition temperature ( about 410 k)@xcite although here one can not estimate the interatomic exchange interaction and t@xmath20 based on the difference between total energies accurately as in the local moment systems@xcite .",
    "since the g  afm configuration is the only insulating state , it is easy to understand that both magnetic and electronic phase transitions occur at the same temperature and our calculation indeed confirms that the mit  of naoso@xmath0 is a slater  type transition .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the detailed electronic structure and magnetic properties of naoso@xmath0 using full potential linearized augmented plane wave method .",
    "our results show that the electronic structure near the fermi energy e@xmath21 is dominated by strongly hybridized os 5__d _ _ and o 2__p _ _ states . despite of its big value",
    "the soc has only weak effect on the band structure and magnetic moment .",
    "the electronic correlations alone can not open the band gap , and the low temperature phase of naoso@xmath0 is not a mott  type insulator .",
    "the magnetic configuration has an important effect on the conductivity , and the ground state is a g  type afm insulator .",
    "it is the interplay of the coulomb interaction and magnetic ordering that result in the insulating behavior of naoso@xmath0 .",
