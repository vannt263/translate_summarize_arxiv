    "the two - dimensional elastodynamic green tensor  @xcite of the navier equation is the primary building block of solutions for linear elasticity problems involving nonuniformly moving rectilinear line sources , such as dislocations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dislocations are the fundamental carriers of plastic deformation in crystalline materials @xcite .",
    "mathematically , a dislocation stands as a discontinuity of the displacement field on its glide plane .",
    "this discontinuity stands as a boundary condition in traditional methods of solution of continuum mechanics @xcite , or acts more explicitly as a singular source of elastic field if the solution is tackled by means of green functions @xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "the elastodynamic solution for the strain or stress fields involves taking convolution integrals of derivatives of the green tensor by the source functions @xcite .    whereas the two - dimensional green tensor itself is locally integrable , its derivatives are in general hypersingular kernels @xcite , namely , kernels that can not simply be regularized by means of a cauchy principal - value requirement .",
    "still , they are fully legitimate objects within the theory of distributions , their apparent singularity being handled by introducing hadamard s finite - part prescription @xcite . from an operational standpoint , finite parts can ultimately be reduced by carrying out suitable integration by parts on convolution integrals @xcite .",
    "hypersingular kernels are commonly encountered in situations involving static @xcite , as well as nonuniformly moving dislocations or cracks @xcite , notably in the context of so - called boundary - element integral approaches @xcite , and because of their importance in practice , their handling is a recurrent issue in wave physics problems @xcite .    in the two - dimensional setting ,",
    "the dislocation line source is transverse to the @xmath0 plane of motion , in which it reduces to a point in the idealized case of a volterra dislocation . in general , point sources lead to singular ( infinite ) fields at the source position and at wave fronts , which poses some problems in numerical implementations @xcite .",
    "however , infinite fields are merely the hallmark of the breakdown of classical linear elasticity at the dislocation core . in reality",
    ", a physical dislocation has a finite width , that can be measured in atomistic simulations or computed by means of specially devised nonlinear models of the cohesive - zone type @xcite .",
    "also , dislocations of a finite width naturally arise in the framework of gradient elasticity models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "being of finite width is a necessary condition for sources to undergo supersonic motion ( or faster - than - light - speed motion in classical electrodynamics @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "faster - than - wave motions of point sources induce mach or cerenkov cones with unrealistically infinite field strength @xcite . for dislocations or cracks , faster - than - wave motion",
    "@xcite has attracted wide attention during the last decades @xcite .",
    "also , recent medical imaging techniques rely on shear - wave mach cones induced by a fast moving ultrasonic spot at the surface of human skin @xcite .",
    "thus , supersonic motion must be allowed for in any comprehensive theory of radiation fields generated by moving sources .",
    "we should add that , quite generally , the concept of a point source can hardly be avoided when no information about the physical nature of the singular source of field is available .",
    "then , hadamard s finite part regularization , or generalizations thereof , must be employed .",

    ".    however , in the specific context of dislocation theory , convoluting the point source by an appropriate shape function of finite width that represents the core provides a natural regularization of the relevant field integrals at the source location , and at the wave fronts ( including mach cones ) , and allows one to investigate subsonic as well as supersonic motion without the need to address these cases separately @xcite .",
    "in many approaches to finite - size ( so - called _ smeared - out _ ) dislocations  @xcite , core shape functions are often found or assumed of power - law decay in the space variable @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an exponentially - decaying shape function with cut - off characteristic length is produced by the theory of gradient elasticity of the helmholtz type ( e.g. , @xcite ) where the convolution is naturally embedded within the green function of the theory as a consequence of the constitutive relations employed .",
    "this paper introduces an alternative power - law - type way of regularizing the elastodynamic dislocation problem , which tames all singularities of the fields in the whole @xmath0 plane . while resembling certain means @xcite currently employed to regularize elastostatic fields in three - dimensional simulations @xcite it will arise , however , from an immediate analytic continuation of the green tensor to complex values of the time variable , once the elastodynamic fundamental solutions are written down as distributions .",

    "numerical computations were carried out to illustrate the fact that , since the green function embodies all wave propagation effects , cases of subsonic , transonic , or supersonic source motion can be handled altogether by one single closed - form expression . moreover ,",
    "a property ( of geometric origin ) of mach - cone branch extinction on cartesian components of the tensor integrals under consideration was reported .",
    "there are two ways of envisioning the obtained integrals .",
    "the first one is to consider them as computational intermediates to reach the fields in the form of distributions .",
    "indeed , the method is straightforward since we do not need to care about causality constraints at wavefronts . as was explicitly demonstrated in the anti - plane case ,",
    "the distributional forms are obtained by letting the source width parameter @xmath140 ( volterra limit ) . in this limit ,",
    "the resulting distributions represent fields generated by the moving point source .",
    "however ( see introduction ) , such distributional volterra solutions are devoid of any physical meaning in the vicinity of their singularities , namely , the source position and the wavefronts .",
    "this is particularly obvious for faster - than - wave motions where mach cones show up in the limit in terms of the dirac distribution .",
    "thus , no meaningful numbers can be extracted from the limiting integrals , unless the latter are convoluted with a suitable source shape function to produce physical fields .",
    "of course , using for this purpose the isotropic shape function employed for regularizing the green tensor from the outset would result in the same expressions with @xmath88 finite reported above ( assuming the calculation to be manageable this way , which is far from granted ; this is why we started from green s function instead ) .",
    "other shape functions could in principle be employed , perhaps at the price of additional difficulties .",
    "the alternative point of view which has our preference is to consider that the isotropic shape function we employed _ is _ of physical relevance ( at least approximately , say , as some effective mean core shape ; e.g. , in the sense of an angular averaging ) , and to use for simulations the obtained definite integrals as they stand .",
    "this spreads mach cones over a width of order @xmath88 , and makes fields finite everywhere .",
    "keeping @xmath88 nonzero reveals that dramatic variations in strength _ and sign _ of physical fields take place near wavefronts , as our figures clearly show , which may be of consequence for the dislocation nucleation problem @xcite .",
    "then , there remains the question of the value to be attributed to @xmath88 .",
    "from a purely numerical standpoint , any value not leading to overflows in field expressions is acceptable . on the other hand , physics requires _ both _ the source position _ and _ its width to be prescribed by coupled equations of motion , which makes @xmath347 a function of time @xcite . for dislocations in metals ,",
    "this `` physical '' @xmath88 does not exceed a few multiples of the interatomic distance ( but can also be notably smaller , depending on the velocity and acceleration regimes ) . from this perspective , the definite integrals obtained above must be though of as a post - processing device to estimate fields in the surrounding medium , once the dislocation position and  physical \" width are known as functions of time ; the typical size @xmath88 considered in the present work being substituted by the  physical \" one .",
    "however , it is important to point out that our present derivations do not account for the specific radiative contributions induced by such a time - dependence of @xmath88 . with applications in mind",
    ", it could nonetheless be feasible to tentatively neglect the latter ( assuming it to be subdominant ) and carry out this substitution within each time interval in a numerical procedure of the type alluded to in the introduction .",

    "thus ,    @xmath348    as a rule , differentiation , with respect to some variable @xmath349 , of the logarithm or square root of a complex - valued function @xmath350 creates a dirac - like distributional part , if : ( i ) the imaginary part of @xmath351 depends on @xmath349 , and ( ii ) there exists values of @xmath349 such that @xmath352 while @xmath353 . for instance , from eq .",
