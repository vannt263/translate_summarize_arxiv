    "the ability to travel , trade commodities , and share information around the world with unprecedented efficiency is a defining feature of the modern globalized economy . among the different means of transport",
    ", ocean shipping stands out as the most energy efficient mode of long - distance transport for large quantities of goods ( rodrigue _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) . according to estimates , as much as 90% of world trade is hauled by ships ( international maritime organization 2006 ) . in 2006 , 7.4 billion tons of goods were loaded at the world s ports .",
    "the trade volume currently exceeds 30 trillion ton - miles and is growing at a rate faster than the global economy ( united nations conference on trade and development 2007 ) .",
    "the worldwide maritime network also plays a crucial role in today s spread of invasive species .",
    "two major pathways for marine bioinvasion are discharged water from ships ballast tanks ( ruiz _ et al .  _ 2000 ) and hull fouling ( drake & lodge 2007 ) . even terrestrial species such as insects",
    "are sometimes inadvertently transported in shipping containers ( lounibos 2002 ) . in several parts of the world",
    ", invasive species have caused dramatic levels of species extinction and landscape alteration , thus damaging ecosystems and creating hazards for human livelihoods , health , and local economies ( mack _ et al .",
    "the financial loss due to bioinvasion is estimated to be $ 120 billion per year in the united states alone ( pimentel _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) .    despite affecting everybody s daily lives",
    ", the shipping industry is far less in the public eye than other sectors of the global transport infrastructure .",
    "accordingly , it has also received little attention in the recent literature on complex networks ( wei _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 , hu & zhu 2009 ) .",
    "this neglect is surprising considering the current interest in networks ( albert & barabasi 2002 , newman 2003a , gross & blasius 2008 ) , especially airport ( barrat _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 , guimer & amaral 2004 , hufnagel _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 , guimer _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) , road ( buhl _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 , barthelemy & flammini 2008 ) and train networks ( latora & marchiori 2002 , sen _ et al .  _ 2003 ) . in the spirit of current network research , we take here a large - scale perspective on the global cargo ship network ( gcsn ) as a complex system defined as the network of ports that are connected by links if ship traffic passes between them .    similar research in the past had to make strong assumptions about flows on hypothetical networks with connections between all pairs of ports in order to approximate ship movements ( drake & lodge 2004 , tatem _ et al .",
    "by contrast , our analysis is based on comprehensive data of real ship journeys allowing us to construct the actual network .",
    "we show that it has a small - world topology where the combined cargo capacity of ships calling at a given port ( measured in gross tonnage ) follows a heavy - tailed distribution .",
    "this capacity scales superlinearly with the number of directly connected ports .",
    "we identify the most central ports in the network and find several groups of highly interconnected ports showing the importance of regional geopolitical and trading blocks .    a high - level description of the complete network , however , does not yet fully capture the network s complexity . unlike previously studied transportation networks , the gcsn has a multi - layered structure .",
    "there are , broadly speaking , three classes of cargo ships  container ships , bulk dry carriers , and oil tankers  that span distinct subnetworks .",
    "ships in different categories tend to call at different ports and travel in distinct patterns .",
    "we analyze the trajectories of individual ships in the gcsn and develop techniques to extract quantitative information about characteristic movement types . with these methods",
    "we can quantify that container ships sail along more predictable , frequently repeating routes than oil tankers or bulk dry carriers .",
    "we compare the empirical data with theoretical traffic flows calculated by the gravity model .",
    "simulation results , based on the full gcsn data or the gravity model differ significantly in a population - dynamic model for the spread of invasive species between the world s ports .",
    "predictions based on the real network are thus more informative for international policy decisions concerning the stability of worldwide trade and for reducing the risks of bioinvasion .",
    "an analysis of global ship movements requires detailed knowledge of ships arrival and departure times at their ports of call .",
    "such data have become available in recent years .",
    "starting in 2001 , ships and ports have begun installing automatic identification system ( ais ) equipment .",
    "ais transmitters on board of the ships automatically report the arrival and departure times to the port authorities .",
    "this technology is primarily used to avoid collisions and increase port security , but arrival and departure records are also made available by lloyd s register fairplay for commercial purposes as part of its sea - web data base ( www.sea-web.com ) .",
    "ais devices have not been installed in all ships and ports yet , and therefore there are some gaps in the data .",
    "still , all major ports and the largest ships are included , thus the data base represents the majority of cargo transported on ships .",
    "our study is based on sea - web s arrival and departure records in the calendar year 2007 as well as sea - web s comprehensive data on the ships physical characteristics .",
    "we restrict our study to cargo ships bigger than @xmath0 gt ( gross tonnage ) which make up 93% of the world s total capacity for ship cargo transport . from these we select all @xmath1 ships",
    "for which ais data are available , taken as representative of the global traffic and long - distance trade between the @xmath2 ports equipped with ais receivers ( for details see electronic supplementary material ) .",
    "for each ship we obtain a trajectory from the data base , i.e. a list of ports visited by the ship sorted by date . in 2007 , there were @xmath3 nonstop journeys linking @xmath4 distinct pairs of arrival and departure ports .",
    "the complete set of trajectories , each path representing the shortest route at sea and colored by the number of journeys passing through it , is shown in fig .",
    "[ full_netw]a .",
    "each trajectory can be interpreted as a small directed network where the nodes are ports linked together if the ship traveled directly between the ports .",
    "larger networks can be defined by merging trajectories of different ships . in this article",
    "we aggregate trajectories in four different ways : the combined network of all available trajectories , and the subnetworks of container ships ( @xmath5 ships ) , bulk dry carriers ( @xmath6 ) and oil tankers ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these three subnetworks combined cover 74% of the gcsn s total gross tonnage . in all four networks ,",
    "we assign a weight @xmath8 to the link from port @xmath9 to @xmath10 equal to the sum of the available space on all ships that have traveled on the link during 2007 measured in gt .",
    "if a ship made the journey from @xmath9 to @xmath10 more than once , its capacity contributes multiple times to @xmath8 .",
    "the directed network of the entire cargo fleet is noticeably asymmetric , with 59% of all linked pairs of ports being connected only in one direction .",
    "still , the vast majority of ports ( 935 out of 951 ) belongs to one single strongly connected component , i.e. for any two ports in this component there are routes in both directions , though possibly visiting different intermediate ports .",
    "the routes are intriguingly short : only few steps in the network are needed to get from one port to another .",
    "the shortest path length @xmath11 between two ports is the minimum number of nonstop connections one must take to travel between origin and destination . in the gcsn , the average over all pairs of ports is extremely small , @xmath12 .",
    "even the maximum shortest path between any two ports ( e.g. from skagway , alaska , to the small italian island of lampedusa ) , is only of length @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the majority of all possible origin - destination pairs ( 52% ) can already be connected by two steps or less .    comparing these findings to those reported for the worldwide airport network ( wan )",
    "shows interesting differences and similarities .",
    "the high asymmetry of the gcsn has not been found in the wan , indicating that ship traffic is structurally very different from aviation . rather than being formed by the accumulation of back and forth trips , ship traffic seems to be governed by an optimal arrangement of unidirectional , often circular routes .",
    "this optimality also shows in the gcsn s small shortest path lengths . in comparison , in the wan , the average and maximum shortest path lengths are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively ( guimer _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) , i.e. about twice as long as in the gcsn .",
    "similar to the wan , the gcsn is highly clustered : if a port @xmath16 is linked to ports @xmath17 and @xmath18 , there is a high probability that there is also a connection from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "we calculated a clustering coefficient @xmath19 ( watts & strogatz 1998 ) for directed networks and find @xmath20 whereas random networks with the same number of nodes and links only yield @xmath21 on average .",
    "degree dependent clustering coefficients @xmath22 reveal that clustering decreases with node degree ( see electronic supplementary material ) .",
    "therefore , the gcsn   like the wan   can be regarded as a small - world network possessing short path lengths despite substantial clustering ( watts & strogatz 1998 ) . however , the average degree of the gcsn , i.e. the average number of links arriving at and departing from a given port ( in- plus out - degree ) , @xmath23 , is notably higher than in the wan where @xmath24 ( barrat _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) . in the light of the network size ( the wan consists of 3880 nodes ) , this difference becomes even more pronounced , indicating that the gcsn is much more densely connected .",
    "this redundancy of links gives the network high structural robustness to the loss of routes for keeping up trade .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath25 shows that most ports have few connections , but there are some ports linked to hundreds of other ports ( fig .",
    "[ degree_distribution]a ) .",
    "similar right - skewed degree distributions have been observed in many real - world networks ( barabasi & albert 1999 ) . while the gcsn s degree distribution is not exactly scale - free , the distribution of link weights , @xmath26 , follows approximately a power law @xmath27 with @xmath28 ( 95% ci for linear regression , fig .",
    "[ degree_distribution]b , see also electronic supplementary material ) . by averaging the sums of the link weights arriving at and departing from port @xmath9",
    ", we obtain the node strength @xmath29 ( barrat _ et al .",
    "the strength distribution can also be approximated by a power law @xmath30 with @xmath31 , meaning that a small number of ports handle huge amounts of cargo ( fig .",
    "[ degree_distribution]c ) . the determination of power law relationships by line fitting has been strongly criticised ( e.g. newman 2005 , clauset _ et al .  _ 2009 ) , therefore we analysed the distributions with model selection by akaike weights ( burnham & anderson 1998 ) .",
    "our results confirm that a power law is a better fit than an exponential or a log - normal distribution for @xmath26 and @xmath32 , but not @xmath25 ( see electronic supplementary material ) .",
    "these findings agree well with the concept of hubs - spokes networks ( notteboom 2004 ) that were proposed for cargo traffic , for example in asia ( robinson 1998 ) .",
    "there are a few large , highly connected ports through which all smaller ports transact their trade .",
    "this scale - free property makes the ship trade network prone to the spreading and persistence of bioinvasive organisms ( e.g. pastor - satorras & vespignani 2001 ) .",
    "the average nearest neighbors s degrees , a measure of network assortativity , additionally underline the hubs - spokes property of cargo ship traffic ( see electronic supplementary material ) .    strengths and degrees of the ports",
    "are related according to the scaling relation @xmath33 ( 95% ci for sma regression , warton _",
    "hence , the strength of a port grows generally faster than its degree ( fig .",
    "[ degree_distribution]d ) . in other words ,",
    "highly connected ports not only have many links , but their links also have a higher than average weight .",
    "this observation agrees with the fact that busy ports are better equipped to handle large ships with large amounts of cargo .",
    "a similar result , @xmath34 , was found for airports ( barrat _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) , which may hint at a general pattern in transportation networks . in the light of bioinvasion , these results underline empirical findings that big ports are more heavily invaded because of increased propagule pressure by ballast water of more and larger ships ( mack _ et al .  _ 2000 , williamson 1996 , see e.g. cohen & carlton 1998 ) .",
    "a further indication of the importance of a node is its betweenness centrality ( freeman 1979 , newman 2004 ) .",
    "the betweenness of a port is the number of topologically shortest directed paths in the network that pass through this port . in fig .",
    "[ full_netw]b we plot and list the most central ports . generally speaking , centrality and degree",
    "are strongly correlated ( pearson s correlation coefficient : @xmath35 ) , but in individual cases other factors can also play a role .",
    "the panama and suez canal , for instance , are shortcuts to avoid long passages around south america and africa .",
    "other ports have a high centrality because they are visited by a large number of ships ( e.g. shanghai ) whereas others gain their status primarily by being connected to many different ports ( e.g. antwerp ) .",
    "to compare the movements of cargo ships of different types , separate networks were generated for each of the three main ship types : container ships , bulk dry carriers , and oil tankers . applying the network parameters introduced in the previous section to these three subnetworks reveals some broad - scale differences ( see table  [ tab : trajs ] ) .",
    "the network of container ships is densely clustered , @xmath36 , has a rather low mean degree , @xmath37 , and a large mean number of journeys ( i.e. number of times any ship passes ) per link , @xmath38 . the bulk dry carrier network , on the other hand , is less clustered , has a higher mean degree , and fewer journeys per link ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) . for the oil tankers ,",
    "we find intermediate values ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that the mean degrees @xmath45 of the subnetworks are substantially smaller than that of the full gcsn , indicating that different ship types use essentially the same ports but different connections .",
    "a similar tendency appears in the scaling of the link weight distributions ( fig .",
    "[ degree_distribution]b ) .",
    "@xmath26 can be approximated as power laws for each network , but with different exponents @xmath46 .",
    "the container ships have the smallest exponent ( @xmath47 ) and bulk dry carriers the largest ( @xmath48 ) with oil tankers in between ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "in contrast , the exponents for the distribution of node strength @xmath32 are nearly identical in all three subnetworks , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "these numbers give a first indication that different ship types move in distinctive patterns .",
    "container ships typically follow set schedules visiting several ports in a fixed sequence along their way , thus providing regular services .",
    "bulk dry carriers , by contrast , appear less predictable as they frequently change their routes on short notice depending on the current supply and demand of the goods they carry . the larger variety of origins and destinations in the bulk dry carrier network ( @xmath53 ports , compared to @xmath54 for container ships ) explains the higher average degree and the smaller number of journeys for a given link .",
    "oil tankers also follow short - term market trends , but , because they can only load oil and oil products , the number of possible destinations ( @xmath55 ) is more limited than for bulk dry carriers .",
    "these differences are also underlined by the betweenness centralities of the three network layers ( see electronic supplementary material ) .",
    "while some ports rank highly in all categories ( e.g. suez canal , shanghai ) , others are specialized on certain ship types .",
    "for example , the german port of wilhelmshaven ranks tenth in terms of its world - wide betweenness for oil tankers , but is only 241st for bulk dry carriers and 324th for container ships .",
    "we can gain further insight into the roles of the ports by examining their community structure .",
    "communities are groups of ports with many links within the groups but few links between different groups .",
    "we calculated these communities for the three subnetworks with a modularity optimization method for directed networks ( leicht & newman 2008 ) and found that they differ significantly from modularities of corresponding erds - renyi graphs ( fig .",
    "[ modularity ] , guimer _ et al .",
    "the network of container trade shows 12 communities ( fig .",
    "[ modularity]a ) .",
    "the largest ones are located ( 1 ) on the arabian , asian , and south african coasts , ( 2 ) on the north american east coast and in the caribbean , ( 3 ) in the mediterranean , the black sea , and on the european west coast , ( 4 ) in northern europe , and ( 5 ) in the far east and on the american west coast . the transport of bulk dry goods reveals 7 groups ( fig .",
    "[ modularity]b ) . some can be interpreted as geographic entities ( e.g. north american east coast , trans - pacific trade ) while others are dispersed on multiple continents .",
    "especially interesting is the community structure of the oil transportation network which shows 6 groups ( fig .",
    "[ modularity]c ) : ( 1 ) the european , north and west african market ( 2 ) a large community comprising asia , south africa and australia , ( 3 ) three groups for the atlantic market with trade between venezuela , the gulf of mexico , the american east coast and northern europe , and ( 4 ) the american pacific coast .",
    "it should be noted that the network includes the transport of crude oil as well as commerce with already refined oil products so that oil producing regions do not appear as separate communities .",
    "this may be due to the limit in the detectability of smaller communities by modularity optimization ( fortunato & barthlemy 2007 ) , but does not affect the relevance of the revealed ship traffic communities . because of the , by definition , higher transport intensity within communities , bioinvasive spread is expected to be heavier between ports of the same community .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ modularity ] it becomes clear that there are no strict geographical barriers between communities .",
    "thus , spread between communities is very likely to occur even on small spatial scales by shipping or ocean currents between close - by ports that belong to different communities .    despite the differences between the three main cargo fleets ,",
    "there is one unifying feature : their motif distribution ( milo _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) . like most previous studies",
    ", we focus here on the occurrence of three - node motifs and present their normalized @xmath18 score , a measure for their abundance in a network ( fig .",
    "[ motif ] ) .",
    "strikingly , the three fleets have practically the same motif distribution .",
    "in fact , the @xmath18 scores closely resemble those found in the world wide web and different social networks which were conjectured to form a superfamily of networks ( milo _ et al .",
    "this superfamily displays many transitive triplet interactions ( i.e. if @xmath56 and @xmath57 , then @xmath58 ) ; for example , the overrepresented motif 13 in fig .  [ motif ] , has six such interactions .",
    "intransitive motifs , like motif 6 , are comparably infrequent .",
    "the abundance of transitive interactions in the ship networks indicates that cargo can be transported both directly between ports as well as via several intermediate ports .",
    "thus , the high clustering and redundancy of links ( robustness to link failures ) appears not only in the gcsn but also in the three subnetworks .",
    "the similarity of the motif distributions to other humanly optimized networks underlines that cargo trade , like social networks and the world wide web , depends crucially on human interactions and information exchange . while advantageous for the robustness of trade , the clustering of links as triplets also has an unwanted side effect : in general , the more clustered a network , the more vulnerable it becomes to the global spread of alien species , even for low invasion probabilities ( newman 2003b ) .",
    "going beyond the network perspective , the data base also provides information about the movement characteristics per individual ship ( table  [ tab : trajs ] ) .",
    "the average number of distinct ports per ship @xmath59 does not differ much between different ship classes , but container ships call much more frequently at ports than bulk dry carriers and oil tankers .",
    "this difference is explained by the characteristics and operational mode of these ships .",
    "normally , container ships are fast ( between 20 and 25 knots ) and spend less time ( @xmath60 days on average in our data ) in the port for cargo operations .",
    "by contrast , bulk dry carriers and oil tankers move more slowly ( between 13 and 17 knots ) and stay longer in the ports ( on average @xmath61 days for bulk dry carriers , @xmath62 days for oil tankers ) .    the speed at sea and of cargo handling , however , is not the only operational difference .",
    "the topology of the trajectories also differs substantially .",
    "characteristic sample trajectories for each ship type are presented in fig .",
    "[ distributions_p]a - c . the container ship ( fig .",
    "[ distributions_p]a ) travels on some of the links several times during the study period whereas the bulk dry carrier ( fig .",
    "[ distributions_p]b ) passes almost every link exactly once . the oil tanker ( fig .",
    "[ distributions_p]c ) commutes a few times between some ports , but by and large also serves most links only once .",
    "we can express these trends in terms of a `` regularity index '' @xmath63 that quantifies how much the frequency with which each link is used deviates from a random network .",
    "consider the trajectory of a ship calling @xmath64 times at @xmath65 distinct ports and travelling on @xmath66 distinct links .",
    "we compare the mean number of journeys per link @xmath67 to the average link usage @xmath68 in an ensemble of randomized trajectories with the same number of nodes @xmath65 and port calls @xmath64 . to quantify the difference between real and random trajectories we calculate the @xmath18 score @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is the standard deviation of @xmath71 in the random ensemble ) . if @xmath72 , the real trajectory is indistinguishable from a random walk , whereas larger values of @xmath63 indicate that the movement is more regular .",
    "figures [ distributions_p]d - f present the distributions of the regularity index @xmath63 for the different fleets . for container ships , @xmath63 is distributed broadly around @xmath73 , thus supporting our earlier observation that most container ships provide regular services between ports along their way .",
    "trajectories of bulk dry carriers and oil tankers , on the other hand , appear essentially random with the vast majority of ships near @xmath72 .",
    "in this article , we view global ship movements as a network based on detailed arrival and departure records . until recently , surveys of seaborne trade had to rely on far less data : only the total number of arrivals at some major ports were publicly accessible , but not the ships actual paths ( zachcial & heideloff 2001 ) .",
    "missing information about the frequency of journeys , thus , had to be replaced by plausible assumptions , the gravity model being the most popular choice .",
    "it posits that trips are , in general , more likely between nearby ports than between ports far apart .",
    "if @xmath74 is the distance between ports @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the decline in mutual interaction is expressed in terms of a distance deterrence function @xmath75 .",
    "the number of journeys from @xmath9 to @xmath10 then takes the form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the total number of departures from port @xmath9 and @xmath78 the number of arrivals at @xmath10 ( haynes & fotheringham 1984 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 are needed to ensure @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "how well can the gravity model approximate real ship traffic ?",
    "we choose a truncated power law for the deterrence function , @xmath83 .",
    "the strongest correlation between model and data is obtained for @xmath84 and @xmath85 km ( see electronic supplementary material ) . at first sight , the agreement between data and model appears indeed impressive .",
    "the predicted distribution of travelled distances ( fig .",
    "[ gravity]a ) fits the data far better than a simpler non - spatial model that preserves the total number of journeys , but assumes completely random origins and destinations",
    ".    a closer look at the gravity model , however , reveals its limitations . in fig .",
    "[ gravity]b we count how often links with an observed number of journeys @xmath86 are predicted to be passed @xmath87 times .",
    "ideally all data points would align along the diagonal @xmath88 , but we find that the data are substantially scattered . although the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 were chosen to minimize the scatter , the correlation between data and model is only moderate ( kendall s @xmath91 ) . in some cases ,",
    "the prediction is off by several thousand journeys per year .",
    "recent studies have used the gravity model to pinpoint the ports and routes central to the spread of invasive species ( drake & lodge 2004 , tatem _ et al .",
    "the model s shortcomings pose the question how reliable such predictions are . for this purpose",
    ", we investigated a dynamic model of ship - mediated bioinvasion where the weights of the links are either the observed traffic flows or the flows of the gravity model .",
    "we follow previous epidemiological studies ( rvachev & longini 1985 , flahault _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 , hufnagel _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 , colizza _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) in viewing the spread on the network as a metapopulation process where the population dynamics on the nodes are coupled by transport on the links . in our model",
    ", ships can transport a surviving population of an invasive species with only a small probability @xmath92 on each journey between two successively visited ports .",
    "the transported population is only a tiny fraction @xmath93 of the population at the port of origin . immediately after arriving at a new port , the species experiences strong demographic fluctuations which lead in most cases to the death of the imported population .",
    "if however the new immigrants beat the odds of this `` ecological roulette '' ( carlton & geller 1993 ) and establish , the population @xmath94 grows rapidly following the stochastic logistic equation @xmath95 with growth rate @xmath96 and gaussian white noise @xmath97 . for details of the model",
    ", we refer to the electronic supplementary material .    starting from a single port at carrying capacity @xmath98 , we model contacts between ports as poisson processes with rates @xmath86 ( empirical data ) or @xmath87 ( gravity model ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ metapop]a , the gravity model systematically overestimates the spreading rate , and the difference can become particularly pronounced for ports which are well - connected , but not among the central hubs in the network ( fig .",
    "[ metapop]b ) . comparing typical sequences of infected ports , we find that the invasions driven by the real traffic flows tend to be initially confined to smaller regional ports , whereas in the gravity model the invasions quickly reach the hubs",
    ". the total out- and in - flows at the ship journeys origin and departure ports , respectively , are indeed more strongly positively correlated in reality than in the model ( @xmath99 vs.   @xmath100 ) .",
    "the gravity model thus erases too many details of a hierarchical structure present in the real network .",
    "that the gravity model eliminates most correlations , is also plausible from simple analytic arguments , see electronic supplementary material for details .",
    "the absence of strong correlations makes the gravity model a suitable null hypothesis if the correlations in the real network are unknown , but several recent studies have shown that correlations play an important role in spreading processes on networks ( e.g. newman 2002 , bogua & pastor - satorras 2002 ) . hence , if the correlations are known , they should not be ignored .    while we observed that the spreading rates for the ais data were consistently slower than for the gravity model even when different parameters or population models were considered , the time scale of the invasion is much less predictable .",
    "the assumption that only a small fraction of invaders succeed outside their native habitat appears realistic ( mack _ et al .",
    "furthermore , the parameters in our model were adjusted so that the per - ship - call probability of initiating invasion is approximately @xmath101 , a rule - of - thumb value stated by drake & lodge ( 2004 ) . still , too little",
    "is empirically known to pin down individual parameters with sufficient accuracy to give more than a qualitative impression .",
    "it is especially difficult to predict how a potential invader reacts to the environmental conditions at a specific location .",
    "growth rates certainly differ greatly between ports depending on factors such as temperature or salinity , with respect to the habitat requirements of the invading organisms .",
    "our results should , therefore , be regarded as one of many different conceivable scenarios .",
    "a more detailed study of bioinvasion risks based on the gcsn is currently underway ( seebens & blasius 2009 ) .",
    "we have presented a study of ship movements based on ais records . viewing the ports as nodes in a network linked by ship journeys",
    ", we found that global cargo shipping , like many other complex networks investigated in recent years , possesses the small world property as well as broad degree and weight distributions .",
    "other features , like the importance of canals and the grouping of ports into regional clusters , are more specific to the shipping industry . an important characteristic of the network",
    "are differences in the movement patterns of different ship types .",
    "bulk dry carriers and oil tankers tend to move in a less regular manner between ports than container ships .",
    "this is an important result regarding the spread of invasive species because bulk dry carriers and oil tankers often sail empty and therefore exchange large quantities of ballast water . the gravity model , which is the traditional approach to forecasting marine biological invasions , captures some broad trends of global cargo trade , but for many applications its results are too crude .",
