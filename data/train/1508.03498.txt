    "compressive sensing  @xcite is an emerging technique to acquire and process digital data such as two - dimensional images  @xcite , hyperspectal images  @xcite , polarization images  @xcite and videos  @xcite .",
    "compressive sensing is most effective when it is used in data acquisition : to capture the data in the form of compressive measurements  @xcite .",
    "though the theory has been established over a decade ago  @xcite , practical applications are still attracting researchers and engineers . with compressive measurements",
    ", images may be reconstructed with far fewer measurements than the number of pixels in the original images .",
    "therefore , by using compressive sensing in acquisition , images are compressed while they are captured , avoiding high speed processing , or transmission , of a large number of pixels .",
    "the single pixel camera  @xcite directly captures compressive measurements of an image , which is a camera architecture that employs a digital micromirror array to perform optical implementation of linear projections of an image onto pseudo - random binary patterns .",
    "it has the ability to obtain an image with a single detection element while sampling the image fewer times than the number of pixels .",
    "the same camera architecture is also used for terahertz imaging  @xcite , and millimeter wave imaging   and x - ray imaging  @xcite .",
    "these cameras all make use of a lens to form an image in a plane before the image is projected onto a pseudo - random binary pattern .",
    "lenses , however , severely constrain the geometric and radiometric mapping from the scene to the image  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , lenses add size , cost and complexity to a camera , especially at the non - visible bandwidth .    in this paper",
    ", we present an in - depth description and mathematical analysis of a lensless compressive imaging architecture that was originally proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we have built a new version of lensless camera with new hardware under the same architecture , which consists of two components , an aperture assembly and a single sensor .",
    "no lens is used .",
    "the aperture assembly consists of a two dimensional array of aperture elements .",
    "the transmittance of each aperture element is independently controllable .",
    "the sensor is a single detection element , such as a single photo - conductive cell .",
    "each aperture element together with the sensor defines a cone of a bundle of rays , and the cones of the aperture assembly define the pixels of an image .",
    "the sensor is used for taking compressive measurements .",
    "each measurement is the integration of rays in the cones modulated by the transmittance of the aperture elements .",
    "the proposed architecture is different from the cameras of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental difference is how the image is formed . in both  @xcite and  @xcite , an image of the scene",
    "is formed on a plane , by some physical mechanism such a lens or a pinhole , before it is digitally captured ( by compressive measurements in  @xcite , and by pixels in  @xcite ) . in the proposed architecture of this work ,",
    "no image is physically formed before the image is captured . the proposed architecture",
    "is also related to , the traditional coded aperture imaging  @xcite .",
    "specifically , if the sensor number is on the order of the aperture element figures , the proposed architecture will be the coded aperture .",
    "however , only a single detector is used in our system .",
    "the proposed architecture is distinctive with the following features .    *",
    "no lens is used . an imaging device using the proposed architecture",
    "can be built with reduced size , weight , cost and complexity .",
    "in fact , our architecture does not rely on any physical mechanism to form an image before it is digitally captured . *",
    "no scene is out of focus .",
    "the sharpness and resolution of images from the proposed architecture are basically limited by the resolution of the aperture assembly ( number of aperture elements ) , there is no blurring introduced by lens for scenes that are out of focus . * the same architecture can be used for imaging of visible spectrum , and other spectra such as infrared and millimeter waves . * when multiple sensors are used in our system , they can be placed in arbitrary position and the scene is still in focus for each sensor .",
    "therefore , it readily forms a multi - view system  @xcite . *",
    "the proposed architecture can be used to capture hyperspectral images  @xcite and polarized images  @xcite by integrating related hardware .",
    "we built a prototype device for capturing images of visible spectrum .",
    "it consists of an lcd panel , and a photo - electric detector .",
    "though the camera has been introduced in  @xcite , no algorithm has been developed particularly for this new camera and in this paper we present more details on both hardware and algorithm development .",
    "the proposed algorithm is an _ anytime _",
    "algorithm  @xcite . as defined in  @xcite ,",
    " anytime algorithms are algorithms whose quality of results improves gradually as computation time increases \" .",
    "specifically , the solution in each iteration of our algorithm _ monotonically _ converges to the ground truth .",
    "in addition , we compare our new algorithm with jpeg compression at ( roughly ) the same compression ratio ( based on the size of jpeg files ) .",
    "more importantly , we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves similar quality of jpeg at high compression ratio .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the architecture is described in section  [ sec : arc ] and section  [ sec : form ] derives the mathematical formulation .",
    "our new algorithm is proposed in section  [ sec : algo ] and section  [ sec : sim ] provides extensive simulation results .",
    "section  [ sec : hardware ] presents the experimental hardware and real data results .",
    "section  [ sec : col ] summarizes the entire paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : arch ] depicts the proposed architecture , which consists of two principle components : an aperture assembly and a single sensor ( a photodiode ) , which measures the light intensity to capture grayscale images , or a tri - color sensor which measures intensity of each rgb channel to capture color images .",
    "the aperture assembly is made up of a two dimensional array of aperture elements ( blocks on the aperture assembly in figure  [ fig : arch ] ) ; the transmittance of each element @xmath0 can be individually controlled with @xmath1 denoting the dimension of the aperture assembly .",
    "each element of the aperture assembly , together with the sensor , defines a cone of a bundle of rays ( figure  [ fig : arch ] ) , and the integration of the rays within a cone is defined as a pixel value of the image .",
    "therefore , in the proposed architecture , an image is defined by the pixels which correspond to the array of aperture elements in the aperture assembly .",
    "one possible way to measure an image with a single sensor is to capture the image pixel by pixel , which can be implemented by reading of the sensor when one of the aperture elements is completely open ( @xmath2 ) and all others are completely closed ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the measurements are the pixel values of the image when the elements of the aperture assembly are opened one by one in certain scan order .",
    "this corresponds to the traditional representation of a digital image pixel by pixel .    with compressive sensing ,",
    "it is possible to represent an image by using fewer measurements than the number of pixels  @xcite .",
    "the proposed architecture in figure  [ fig : arch ] aims to simplify the procedure of capturing compressive measurements .",
    "recall in compressive sensing  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sensing matrix , @xmath6 is the desired signal ( denoting vectorized image in this work and @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the measurement and usually @xmath9 ; @xmath10 symbolizes the measurement noise .",
    "each row of @xmath11 defines a pattern for the elements of the aperture assembly , and the number of columns in a sensing matrix is equal to the number of total elements in the aperture assembly .",
    "each value in a row of the sensing matrix is used to define the transmittance of an element of the aperture assembly .",
    "a row of the sensing matrix therefore completely defines a pattern for the aperture assembly , and it allows the sensor to make one measurement ( one element in @xmath12 ) for the given pattern of the aperture assembly . the number of rows of the sensing matrix is the number of measurements , which is usually much smaller than the number of aperture elements in the aperture assembly ( the number of pixels ) .",
    "let @xmath11 be a matrix whose entries are random numbers between 0 and 1 . to make a measurement , the transmittance , @xmath13 , of each aperture element",
    "is controlled to equal the value of the corresponding entry in a row of the sensing matrix .",
    "the sensor integrates all rays transmitted through the aperture assembly .",
    "the intensity of the rays is modulated by the transmittances before they are integrated .",
    "therefore , each measurement from the sensor is the integration of the intensity of rays through the aperture assembly multiplied by the transmittance of respective aperture element .",
    "a measurement from the sensor is hence a projection of the image onto the row of the sensing matrix . by changing the pattern of the transmittance of the aperture assembly",
    ", the compressive measurement is captured corresponding to a given sensing matrix .",
    "in this section , we formally define what an image is in the proposed architecture and how it is related to the measurements from the sensor .",
    "in particular , we will describe how a pixelized image can be reconstructed from the measurements taken from the sensor .",
    "the analog scene @xmath14 can be defined on any plane between the scene and the sensor and for convenience , we here define the image on the aperture assembly .",
    "considering one point on the aperture assembly , there is a ray starting from a point on the scene , passing through the point @xmath15 on the aperture assembly , and ending at the sensor .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the intensity of this ray arriving at the sensor , passing through the aperture assembly @xmath15 at time @xmath17 .",
    "the image point @xmath14 can be defined by the integration of the ray in a time interval @xmath18 @xmath19 it is worth noting that @xmath20 is continuously defined in the region of the aperture assembly and can be considered as an analog image .",
    "similarly , define the continuous transmittance pattern of the aperture assembly as @xmath21 , the measurement collected by the sensor is the integration of the rays through the aperture assembly , modulated by the transmittance pattern @xmath21 , @xmath22 equation ( [ eq : z ] ) defines the measurement of the sensor based on the continuous image in ( [ eq : ixy ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we analyze how the pixel is defined and then we can get the discretized image .",
    "since only a single sensor is used in our system , the virtual image defined in ( [ eq : ixy ] ) can be pixelized by the aperture assembly , which is similar to the single - pixel camera  @xcite .",
    "considering each element of the aperture assembly of size @xmath23 , each pixel value of image can be represented by the integration of all the rays passing through the aperture element @xmath24 : @xmath25 image @xmath26 can be vectorized to a long vector @xmath27 , which is the target signal @xmath6 in the compressive sensing model ( [ eq : yax ] ) and the image size is of @xmath28 .      when the aperture assembly is programmed to implement a compressive sensing matrix , the transmittance @xmath29 of each aperture element is controlled to equal the value of the corresponding entry in the sensing matrix . for the @xmath30-th measurement",
    ", the entries in row @xmath30 of the sensing matrix are used to program the transmittance of the aperture elements .",
    "specifically , let the sensing matrix @xmath31 be a matrix whose entries , @xmath32 , are random numbers between 0 and 1 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the transmittance of aperture element @xmath24 for the @xmath30-th measurement .",
    "following ( [ eq : z ] ) , the @xmath30-th measurement can be represented as @xmath34 where we consider that each aperture element , inside the region @xmath35 \\times [ ( j-1)\\delta_v , j \\delta_v]$ ] , @xmath36 , is a constant programmed by the user .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the vectorized formulation of @xmath37 , and then we have @xmath38 .",
    "after taking @xmath39 measurements , in the noiseless case , we can write the sensing process as @xmath40 which is now the compressive sensing formulation as in ( [ eq : yax ] ) ( if the noise is considered ) . then",
    ", our problem becomes that given @xmath31 ( designed and _ known a priori _ ) and the measurements @xmath41 , how to reconstruct the image @xmath42 . a new algorithm , which explores the sparsity of the local region in a transformation domain , _",
    "e.g. , _ the dct ( discrete cosine transformation ) used in the jpeg compression , is proposed below to achieve the state - of - the - art reconstruction .",
    "the theory developed for compressive sensing  @xcite requires that the target signal @xmath6 is sparse and following this , researchers have extended the sparsity of the signal in a transformation domain .",
    "for example , the wavelet transformation  @xcite is generally used in the image reconstruction of compressive sensing .",
    "since the wavelet is usually imposed globally on the entire image , we term this as global transformation ( the total variation used in  @xcite is also performed globally ) . under these transformations , the coefficients usually have the same ( or similar ) number of the image pixels and these coefficients are approximately sparse ( or compressible  @xcite ) .",
    "a variety of algorithms ( see references in  @xcite ) have been developed to explore the sparsity of these coefficients .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the basis of transformation , the signal @xmath6 can be represented as @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the coefficients in the transformation domain .",
    "plug ( [ eq : xttheta ] ) into ( [ eq : yax ] ) , we have @xmath46 most algorithms have been developed ( for example  @xcite ) to solve : @xmath47 or the variates of this problem with @xmath48 denoting the @xmath49 norm .",
    "advantages of these algorithms include fast computation and low memory cost by assuming that @xmath50 is easily invertible .",
    "when @xmath50 is an orthonormal matrix , such as the wavelet transformation , solving @xmath51 in ( [ eq : theta_l1 ] ) is equivalent to solve @xmath42 .",
    "however , in other cases as stated below , there may be no one by one correspondence between @xmath42 and @xmath51 .",
    "recently , researchers have found that by exploiting the local ( region ) sparsity of the image can achieve better results than the global transformation methods , examples including the low - rank regularizer  @xcite and the denoising based method  @xcite .      inspired by the jpeg compression and the emerging dictionary learning algorithms  @xcite for local patches ,",
    "researchers have developed algorithms based on the sparsity of the local patches in specific basis or learned dictionaries  @xcite . consider a general case , in which @xmath52 in ( [ eq : yxttheta ] ) is now not a linear independent basis , but a more general dictionary , @xmath53 and usually @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the patch formulation of the image @xmath42 , with @xmath56 denoting the vectorized patch length ( _ e.g. _ , a @xmath57 two dimensional patch ) and @xmath58 symbolizing the number of patches extracted from the image @xmath6 .",
    "we can write @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes an extraction and permutation matrix . under the dictionary @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a matrix",
    "whose columns are the coefficients of each patch and it is usually sparse . recall the key of compressive sensing is to find a sparse basis and with the formulation in ( [ eq : xdalpha ] ) , @xmath64 is the basis and @xmath65 plays the role of sparsity .      by adapting the above formulation , the compressive sensing problem is no longer the same as in ( [ eq : theta_l1 ] ) , but can be formulated as an iterative two - step procedure :    * step 1 : to minimize the following objection function @xmath66 * step 2 : to solve the following minimization problem @xmath67    it is worth noting that in step 1 , we do nt need @xmath68 to be sparse , but when @xmath31 is a compressive sensing matrix , a regulizer term is needed , _",
    "e.g. _ , the tv used in  @xcite . an alternative solution is to use the majorization - minimization ( mm ) approach  @xcite , which will be described below . in step 2 ,",
    "when @xmath61 is given , ( [ eq : alpha_l1 ] ) is the conventional sparse coding problem ( or , for each column of @xmath69 , it is compressive sensing problem ) .",
    "different from the formulation in ( [ eq : theta_l1 ] ) , for which diverse algorithms have been developed to solve the unique @xmath51 , thus to obtain @xmath68 , in the above formulation , we aim to get @xmath68 directly and this is also the final target of reconstruction .",
    "therefore , step 2 can be recognized as a denoising step , while step 1 aims to update @xmath68 . in this paper",
    ", we solve step 1 with the euclidean projection  @xcite , which , under the condition of the sensing matrix ( hadamard matrix ) used in our camera , is same as the iterative shrinkage / thresholding ( ist ) derived from the mm .",
    "however , we prove that a larger range of the step - size ( than the ist ) still leads to good convergence .      under the compressive sensing framework , ( [ eq : jx ] ) has a solution in closed form , which is to use pseudo - inversion @xmath71 . by using the mm approach to minimize @xmath72",
    ", we can avoid solving a system of linear equations . at each iteration @xmath73 of the mm approach",
    ", we should find a function @xmath74 that coincides with @xmath72 at @xmath70 but otherwise upper - bounds @xmath72 .",
    "we should choose a majorizer @xmath75 which can be minimized more easily ( without having to solve a system of equations ) .",
    "the @xmath75 is defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the identity matrix and @xmath78 must be chosen to be equal to or greater than the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath79 .",
    "for the hadamard sensing matrix used in our camera , the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath79 is easily obtained ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the update equation of @xmath81 is given by : @xmath82 the gap algorithm , proposed in  @xcite , which has been demonstrated high performance in video compressive sensing  @xcite , has the following update equation : @xmath83 under some condition of the sensing matrix @xmath31 , as the hadamard matrix used in our system , @xmath84 is the identity matrix and thus ( [ eq : gapxk ] ) is same as ( [ eq : istxk ] ) with @xmath85 .",
    "based on the above two methods , we propose a more general update equation for @xmath81 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the step - size and we provide the step - size selection with convergence guarantee in theorem  [ thm : anytime ] .",
    "next , we consider the problem in ( [ eq : alpha_l1 ] ) , which can be recognized as a denoising problem , and different from the previous algorithms  @xcite , the denoising is now performed on the patches of the image obtained by ( [ eq : istxk ] ) . though various algorithms has been developed for this denoising algorithm and the dictionary learning approach",
    "has achieved state - of - the - art results , the computational cost is always high and thus not efficient . on the other hand , the patches based transformation method  @xcite can provide excellent results efficiently .",
    "inspired by this , and the success of jpeg compression , we here propose that , instead of learning a new dictionary , the dct transformation will be used on the _ overlapping _ local patches for denoising .",
    "we will demonstrate that , by using this and one more clustering step on these patches , we achieve better results than the advanced algorithm in  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the transformation based denoising compared with the dictionary learning algorithm is the fast inverse transformation .",
    "it is worth noting that when the transformation is performed on the onverlapping patches , the formulation in ( [ eq : theta_l1 ] ) does not fit anymore and thus we are using ( [ eq : alpha_l1 ] ) here , which can be reformulated as : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the average matrix for the same pixels in different overlapping patches and @xmath50 is the inverse transformation matrix and @xmath90 is thus the vector of coefficients based on local patches .",
    "note that though @xmath91 is a fat matrix ( more columns than rows ) , its pseudo - inverse can be computed efficiently ; we can easily obtain @xmath6 from @xmath90 and vice verse .",
    "this is the key that the proposed algorithm is efficient .",
    "when better results are desired , we can achieve sparser representation of the image by clustering the patches into different groups , and in each group , we can perform a 3d transformation ( _ e.g. _ , 2d dct in space and a wavelet on the 3rd dimension ) , which can be represented as @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the @xmath94-th cluster and @xmath95 symbolize the transformation bases in the first , second and third dimension , respectively .",
    "@xmath96 is coefficients of patches in the @xmath94-th cluster this clustering procedure can be implemented by @xmath73-means or block matching approaches .",
    "note that ( [ eq : xwt3alpha ] ) is invertible ; we can easily obtain @xmath97 from @xmath98 and vice verse .",
    "the next step is to perform denoising ( shrinkage ) on @xmath90 , which can be done using the soft - thresholding  @xcite .",
    "however , how to select the threshold is always a problem and usually a cross - validation is required . for the algorithm proposed here , the thresholding is performed on each cluster and thus is more challenging .",
    "we propose an efficient way to select the threshold below .",
    "the gap algorithm  @xcite enjoys the anytime property by using a particular way to threshold the coefficients .",
    "the basic idea to keep the non - zero coefficients as the same ( or related ) number of the measurement . when the orthonormal transformation is used , the coefficients have the same dimension of @xmath68 .",
    "however , in our case , when the overlapping patches is used , there are far more coefficients than the dimension of @xmath68 , which is implicitly represented by @xmath99 in ( [ eq : xwtalpha ] ) .",
    "therefore , we extend the method in  @xcite by keeping the same compressive sensing ratio for each cluster in the coefficients . specifically , considering the compressive sensing ratio ( csr ) defined by @xmath100 we keep the non - zero number of coefficients in each cluster in proportion to ( csr@xmath101the total number of coefficients in this cluster ) .",
    "we have found that this is very efficient in both simulation and real datasets .",
    "this can also be seen as an adaptive threshold @xmath102 imposed on the coefficients @xmath103 for each cluster at every iteration : @xmath104 which is a shrinkage / thresholding operation  @xcite and @xmath105 denotes the element - wise ( hadamard ) product ; @xmath73 symbolizes the iteration and @xmath93 signifies the cluster number .",
    "this implies that @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the @xmath108-th element of @xmath109-th cluster .",
    "the method described above provides an efficient way to select @xmath110 .",
    "the optimization problem investigated here based on local overlapping patches in ( [ eq : xwt3alpha ] ) as well as the global transformation based approach in ( [ eq : theta_l1 ] ) can be summarized as : @xmath111 where @xmath112 symbolizes the transformation or basis and @xmath113 . for the proposed slope algorithm ,",
    "the average matrix @xmath89 is also manifested in this @xmath112 .",

    "that is , @xmath116 is obtained from ( [ eq : xwt3alpha ] ) by replacing @xmath118 by @xmath119 .    since our algorithm",
    "is based on the shrinkage the coefficients of local overlapping patches , we term it as slope ( shrinkage of local overlapping patches estimator ) , which is summarized in algorithm  [ algo : slope ] , and the ` local ' here denotes that the transformation is performed on local patches , rather than the global transformation performed on the entire image , _",

    "[ algo : slope ]    when we write the optimization problem as in ( [ eq : problem ] ) , it seems the same as ( [ eq : theta_l1 ] ) .",

    ", existed algorithms usually solve the coefficients , @xmath45 , directly , instead of the desired signal @xmath6 , as they assume there is one - by - one correspondence ( each coefficient contributes equally to the signal ) between @xmath45 and @xmath6 ( since wavelet is usually used ) .",
    "however , when the overlapping patches are used , it is different to update @xmath6 as in ( [ eq : slope_x ] ) from updating @xmath45 , as each coefficient is weighted differently ( one pixel corresponds to several different coefficients ) .",
    "we unveil the difference below .",
    "consider updating @xmath45 directly , and the solution to the first step ( [ eq : jx ] ) will be @xmath125 note that @xmath126 is a matrix including the sensing matrix @xmath11 , the pixel averaging matrix @xmath89 and the transformation matrix ( or the dictionary ) ; @xmath127 .",
    "this leads to that @xmath128 is not an identity matrix and it is not easy to explicitly write this matrix .",
    "therefore , updating @xmath6 directly as in ( [ eq : slope_x ] ) is more straightforward and saves a lot of computational workload as well as memory . on the other hand , because of the overlapping patches , the coefficients are not equally important and @xmath89 imposes weights for each coefficient .",
    "left - multiplying @xmath129 on ( [ eq : thetav_k+1 ] ) will lead to ( [ eq : slope_x ] ) : @xmath130 where we have used @xmath131 and @xmath132 and note that @xmath133 is a diagonal matrix  @xcite with each diagonal element in @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath135 is not used as in ( [ eq : thetav_k+1 ] ) , it will be @xmath136 this will bias the solution of @xmath45 , since it treats each coefficient equally  @xcite .",
    "after several iterations , the error will be accumulated and therefore the results are not as good as updating @xmath6 directly . to see this explicitly , left - multiplying @xmath129 on both sides of ( [ eq : thetav_k1 ] ) , we have @xmath137 where we have used @xmath131 and we can see from ( [ eq : xk+1_w ] ) that since @xmath133 is not an identity matrix and thus it is different from ( [ eq : ist_x ] ) .",
    "@xmath89 plays the role of weighting each coefficient for the overlapping patches , since each pixel belongs to different patches .",
    "when the coefficients @xmath45 are transformed back to pixels , each pixel should have equal weight ( since they are equally important ) and therefore , @xmath138 in ( [ eq : thetav_k+1 ] ) balances this importance .",

    "this is a rough , high level comparison because jpeg also performs an entropy encoding after the dct transform and quantization , while in our method , the number of compressive measurements is compared with the number of total pixels , and we did not consider the entropy coding on quantized measurements . when the compression is high ( lower csr ) , the gap between our approach and the jpeg compression is very small ( @xmath225db ) . when the compression gets lower , the gap becomes larger .",
    "one possible reason is that when jpeg is performed on the image , the truth is available and it is very easy to capture useful information from the truth .",
