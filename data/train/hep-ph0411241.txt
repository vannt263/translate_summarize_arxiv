    "the formalism @xcite of hadronic cross sections for the joint resummation of distributions singular at partonic threshold and at zero recoil has so far been applied to only a few processes .",
    "the most recent studies involve processes that proceed at lowest order through a @xmath6 electroweak ( @xmath7 production @xcite ) or yukawa interaction ( higgs production @xcite ) . for these cases , the observables are the production cross sections at fixed mass @xmath8 and measured @xmath9 .",
    "partonic threshold is defined by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the partonic center of mass energy squared , and zero recoil by @xmath12 . at any finite order ,",
    "the distributions take the form of plus - distributions @xmath13_+$ ] and @xmath14_+$ ] . in these observables",
    "the latter distributions enter in the physical cross sections , whereas the former are defined , after factorization , in the context of a perturbative analysis of the hard scattering .",
    "the basis for the joint threshold and recoil resummation for these processes and those proceeding at lowest order through a @xmath15 ( qcd ) reaction was given in ref .",
    "the first application of the formalism to the specific case of prompt photon hadroproduction was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the photon transverse momentum spectrum was analyzed , and a preliminary numerical study performed .",
    "recoil corrections were found to have a significant impact on the photon spectrum , both at large and at small values of @xmath16 .",
    "for such @xmath17 processes , the formalism implements the notion that , in the presence of qcd radiation , the actual transverse momentum produced by the hard collision is not @xmath18 but rather @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the total transverse momentum of soft recoiling partons .",
    "in fact , the joint - resummed partonic @xmath16 spectrum has the form of a hard scattering cross section as a function of @xmath21 , convoluted with a _ perturbative _ , albeit resummed @xmath20 distribution .",
    "the extreme situation @xmath22 in which all transverse momentum is produced through recoil leads to a singularity in the hard scattering function , equivalent to the singularity at zero @xmath16 in the prompt - photon born cross section .",
    "we note however that a recently proposed extension @xcite of joint resummation avoids this singularity .    in this paper",
    "we apply the joint resummation formalism as given in ref .",
    "@xcite to another prominent @xmath23 scattering observable : the @xmath16 distribution of heavy quarks produced in hadronic collisions .",
    "key differences with the prompt - photon case are , first , the presence of the heavy quark mass @xmath24 , preventing a singularity in the hard scattering function when @xmath22 and , second , the possibility of multiple colored states for the produced top quark pair .",
    "we derive joint - resummed and threshold - resummed transverse momentum distributions at next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy , and study for different production channels the dependence on color configurations , as well as differences among the two resummations and the exact next - to - leading order ( nlo ) distribution .",
    "other recent studies for heavy quark @xmath16 distributions based on finite order expansions of threshold resummation can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "relevant formulas are derived in section 2 . in section 3 we present numerical studies of the dependence of the joint resummation effects on the production channel , on color configurations and on the heavy quark flavor .",
    "we also assess the differences with the pure threshold - resummed distribution .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider the inclusive @xmath16 distribution of a heavy quark produced via the strong interaction in a hadron - hadron collision at center of mass ( cm ) energy @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 refers to the two incoming hadrons , @xmath8 to the detected heavy quark and @xmath28 to the unobserved part of the final state which includes also the heavy anti - quark @xmath29 .",
    "the lowest order qcd processes producing a heavy quark are @xmath30 at cm energy @xmath31 with @xmath32 parton momentum fractions .",
    "exact higher order corrections to the differential cross sections for these partonic processes have been computed to nlo @xcite . to any order @xcite the observable",
    "may be written in the following factorized form ( up to power corrections behaving as @xmath33 ) @xmath34 with @xmath35 the partonic differential cross - section , @xmath36 and @xmath37 parton densities , and @xmath38 the factorization and renormalization scale .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate certain effects of soft gluons in these higher order corrections for the heavy quark @xmath16 distribution .",
    "the first of these are threshold enhancements , which essentially involve the energy of soft gluons . in the context of the factorization we define hadronic and partonic threshold by the conditions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , with @xmath41 the transverse mass @xmath42 .",
    "it is convenient to define the scaling variables @xmath43 so that hadronic ( partonic ) threshold is at @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the higher order corrections to the partonic cross section @xmath46 contain distributions that are singular at partonic threshold .",
    "threshold resummation organizes such distributions to all orders .",
    "the second of these are recoil effects , resulting from radiation of soft gluons from initial - state partons .",
    "we wish to treat these effects in the context of joint threshold and recoil resummation . to this end",
    "we employ the refactorization analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , which enables us to identify a hard scattering with reduced cm energy squared @xmath47 and at transverse momentum @xmath48 with respect to the hadronic cm system .",
    "this hard scattering produces a heavy quark with transverse momentum @xmath49 the kinematically allowed range for the invariant mass @xmath8 of the heavy quark pair in this hard scattering is limited from below by @xmath50 so that threshold in the context of joint resummation is defined by @xmath51 a refactorization analysis on the lines of the one performed in ref .",
    "@xcite leads to the following expression for the observable in eq .",
    "@xmath52 where @xmath53 is known as the profile function .",
    "note that we restrict ourselves to relatively soft , perturbative recoil contributions by integrating over @xmath20 in eq .",
    "such that @xmath54 .",
    "implementing a cut - off @xmath55 is of course a rather crude approximation to what should be a consistent matching to finite order results .",
    "the implementation of such a matching procedure is however beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we shall discuss the limitations on the integration variables such as @xmath48 further in the next section .",
    "let us comment on the right hand side of eq .",
    ", moving from bottom to top",
    ". the last line implements transverse momentum conservation , as well as the decomposition of the ( normalized ) above - threshold energy @xmath56 into contributions from collinear radiation ( @xmath57 ) and from wide - angle soft radiation ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the definition of the observable and the refactorization ensure @xcite that only the initial state contributes to the recoil of the hard scattering . the line above the last displays the hard scattering functions @xmath59 , one per color state ( singlet or octet ) in which the heavy quark pair can be produced . in a diagrammatic representation",
    "all its lines are off - shell by at least an amount @xmath60 . the factor @xmath61 accounts for the phase space difference between the hard scattering in the factorized expression eq .",
    "( @xmath62 ) and here , where @xmath63 is appropriate .",
    "the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 summarize the effects of coherent wide - angle soft radiation , and are sensitive to the color structure of the hard scattering . in particular , the effect of soft radiation for our observable is such that , to nll accuracy , there is no mixing between singlet and octet color states , as was already observed for the case of the total heavy - quark cross section near threshold  @xcite .    moving up further in eq .  , the functions @xmath66 are defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and are related to the density of parton @xmath67 in a parton of the same flavor at fixed energy fraction @xmath68 and transverse momentum @xmath69 .",
    "the prime on the @xmath70 function indicates that factors @xmath71 , the square root of the drell - yan soft function , have been introduced in equal numbers in numerator and denominator and then conveniently redistributed between the heavy quark soft functions and the @xmath72 functions in order to remove gauge dependence in the individual functions . finally the top line displays the convolution with standard parton distribution functions , as well as the sum over initial state parton flavors , in which the @xmath73 channels have been neglected because they are suppressed near threshold .    a convenient way to implement the",
    "energy and transverse momentum conservation is by passing to transform space , where the impact vector @xmath74 is fourier conjugate to @xmath20 , and the variable @xmath75 is mellin conjugate to the threshold variables in eqns .   and .",
    "this converts the convolution in eq .   to a product .",
    "we aim at nll accuracy in transform space , that is we account for all contributions @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 can be either @xmath79 or @xmath80 .    using their renormalization group scaling properties , moments of the soft functions may , to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy , be written as @xcite @xmath81\\,.\\ ] ] the solution needs careful definition in order to avoid values of @xmath75 for which @xmath82 is singular .",
    "the @xmath75-integration contour we choose indeed assures this , and anyhow , at nll accuracy , we can approximate the functions @xmath83 by their lowest order expressions .",
    "the form of the one - loop soft anomalous dimensions @xmath84 and @xmath85 we need is straightforwardly derived from the expressions in ref .",

    "@xcite we arrive at @xmath90 where the inverse fourier transform and mellin transform are explicit .",
    "notice in particular the last factor , which provides a kinematic link between recoil and threshold effects .",
    "the exponential functions @xmath91 @xcite to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy are @xmath92 2\\ln\\frac{\\bar n \\mu'}{q } -g b^2",

    "we point out that , at this order , in the @xmath109 channel the heavy quark - antiquark pair is produced only in an octet state .    in a refactorization analysis ,",
    "the expressions @xmath110 and @xmath111 are related to the ( real parts of ) anomalous dimensions of certain operators , composed of wilson lines @xcite , as the structure of eqs .",
    "reflects . because for our case imaginary parts of the virtual corrections ( coulomb phases ) to the anomalous dimension cancel in the cross section , the soft function can be given a natural probabilistic interpretation .",
    "from this viewpoint , at nll accuracy , soft wide - angle gluons can be considered as being emitted independently from the external partons , and approaching threshold is equivalent to suppressing all soft gluon emissions with energies above @xmath112 . furthermore",
    ", due to the fact that there is no mixing between different color structures , soft gluon emission exponentiates straightforwardly . the exponential in eq .",
    "can then be interpreted as the probability of not emitting any wide - angle soft gluon with energy above @xmath112 .",
    "we now offer some comments on the explicit expression of the anomalous dimensions in some limiting cases .",
    "* in the case in which the heavy quarks are at rest in their cm frame , i.e. @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 vanishes , corresponding to the fact that the combined heavy quark - anti - quark pair forms a color - singlet . on the other hand , @xmath116 , which reflects the fact that the quark - antiquark pair produced in an octet state radiates as a single object rather than two separate particles . * for positive moderate values of @xmath117 ( @xmath118 )",
    "we observe that @xmath85 contains the term @xmath119 which is the standard contribution to the anomalous dimension from the @xmath120 antenna . * in the extreme region @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , gluons can become effectively collinear to the heavy quarks . in this case @xmath123",
    "approximates @xmath124 , a large _ collinear _ logarithm .",
    "the resulting logarithmic contributions are identical in @xmath84 and @xmath85 , reflecting the fact that collinear radiation depends only on the color charge of each hard emitting parton , and is not sensitive to the color or geometrical structure of the event . in this large @xmath16 limit",
    ", collinear logarithms should be resummed to all orders , and a different analysis is required @xcite .",
    "this completes our discussion of the joint - resummed transverse momentum distribution .",
    "the threshold - resummed result can now easily be derived , by substituting eq .   into ( after the performing the @xmath47 integral ) and neglecting @xmath20 in the last factor in eq .",
    ". then the @xmath20 integral sets @xmath74 to zero everywhere , yielding the threshold - resummed result .",
    "in this section we demonstrate numerically the soft gluon effects for top and bottom quark transverse momentum distributions for collider and fixed target kinematics respectively . rather than performing a detailed comparison with data ,",
    "our aim is to examine the numerical behavior of our formulas in realistic settings .",
    "we leave therefore also to a future study the application of our results for the description of charm quark / charmed meson @xmath16 spectra in fixed target kinematics .",
    "let us first comment on the allowed integration range of the recoil momentum @xmath9 . in eq .",
    "we have simply imposed an upper limit @xmath55 on the modulus of this transverse momentum vector .",
    "there is however another constraint on @xmath9 , because the recoil factor at the end of eq .",
    "implies the condition @xmath125 which expresses the fact that the available hadronic energy be more than the minimum mass of the final state in the recoiling hard scattering .",
    "clearly , for the maximum value @xmath126 , @xmath48 has no phase space left . for a given value @xmath16 and ( large ) @xmath55",
    "the allowed range can be chosen to be the overlap of the two disks @xmath127 in @xmath20 space @xmath128 or one can choose @xmath55 such that disk @xmath129 fits in @xmath130 .",
    "we chose the former option .",
    "notice that due to the heavy quark mass , the expression in eq .   stays finite at @xmath131 , in contrast to the prompt photon production case analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for top quark production we chose the cut - off @xmath132 gev .",
    "this might seem quite large as a cut - off on recoil momentum , given that the joint - resummation formalism assumes that recoil radiation is soft .",
    "this large value is however relatively innocuous , because , as we will see , for the joint - resummed cross section the dominant @xmath9 values are quite moderate , typically a few percent of the hard scale .",
    "the benefit of this large cut - off value is that , while recoil effects are still dominated by soft gluons , it allows us to recover numerically the threshold - resummed result , in the manner described at the end of section [ sec : obs ] . for bottom quark production",
    "we choose @xmath133  gev , the motivation for this large value being similar to that for the top quark .",
    "before we show results , let us state our default choices for various input parameters .",
    "for these and other plots we use the nlo grv parton density set of ref .",
    "@xcite corresponding to @xmath134 , with the evolution code of ref .",
    "@xcite , changing flavor number at @xmath135 .",
    "we chose the factorization and renormalization scale equal to the transverse mass @xmath41 .",
    "for the non - perturbative gaussian smearing parameter @xmath136 in eq .",
    "we took @xmath137 .",
    "furthermore , to avoid spurious singular behavior at the subleading level , we used , following @xcite @xmath138 with @xmath139 .",
    "we begin with top quark ( @xmath140 gev ) production , and compare in figure [ fig : ptspectra_qq ] joint - resummed , threshold - resummed and the exact lo and nlo calculations for the top quark @xmath16 spectrum produced in the @xmath109 channel at the tevatron ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "we observe that , while the resummed and nlo curves are close for small and moderate @xmath16 ( the inset provides a somewhat better view of the low @xmath16 region ) , for large @xmath16 values the resummed curves depart significantly from the nlo curve .",
    "of course , cross sections for top quark production at such large @xmath16 at the tevatron are far too small to be measured , so that our plots at large @xmath16 have only theoretical interest . for such large @xmath16 values , the hadronic threshold , defined in eq .",
    ", approaches the partonic one , where larger @xmath75 values dominate , a prerequisite for seeing significant effects for both resummations .",
    "the enhancements relative to the born cross section are shown in the form of a k - factor in figure  [ fig : ptspectra_qq ] .",
    "as expected , threshold resummation produces an overall enhancement of the cross section that increases with increasing @xmath16 , yielding e.g. a @xmath142 enhancement over nlo at @xmath143 .",
    "joint resummation almost doubles that effect , which can be understood from the arguments given in the introduction : the joint - resummed enhancement at large @xmath16 effectively constitutes a smearing of the threshold - resummed @xmath16 spectrum by a resummed recoil function .    before showing results for the @xmath102 channel",
    ", we exhibit in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile_qq ] the @xmath9 profile of eq .   for two rather large @xmath16 values , in analogy to fig .  1 in ref .  @xcite . in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig : ptspectra_qq ] , we observe a small enhancement over the threshold - resummed result , in particular at very large @xmath16 .",
    "the peak of the distribution is at relatively soft values of @xmath9 , a few percent of the hard scale @xmath41 . for @xmath144 gev",
    "@xmath9 reaches @xmath55 before the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , so that there is no divergence for larger @xmath9 . for @xmath145 gev",
    "there is a region of @xmath9 phase space where the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is saturated and the cross section diverges .",
    "the onset of that singularity is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile_qq ] , but because of our choice @xmath146 gev it does contribute a small amount to the @xmath147-factor in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptspectra_qq ] at the largest @xmath16 value .",
    "we also observe that , in case of top production , for @xmath148 gev , the disk @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) is fully contained in the disk @xmath130 which represents the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . therefore below that value , which includes all @xmath16 values accessible experimentally ,",
    "all the enhancement of the joint resummed cross section with respect with the threshold resummed is to be ascribed to recoil effects .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : ptspectra_gg ] we show results analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig : ptspectra_qq ] , now for the @xmath102 channel summed over the two color states , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptspectra_ggk ] we show the k - factors per color state .",
    "the k - factors show a significant enhancement for joint resummation with respect to threshold resummation , increasing with increasing @xmath16 , and strongest for octet production .",
    "the resummed spectra are harder than the fixed order ones .",
    "the increased enhancement of the @xmath102 channel over the @xmath109 channel is due to the larger value for @xmath149 compared to @xmath150 in eq .  .",
    "we have verified that both resummed cross sections have a reduced scale dependence with respect to lo , as expected on general grounds @xcite .",
    "the reduction in the resummed cross section is somewhat less than in the exact nlo cross section , suggesting that a matched nll - nlo calculation would do better still in this regard .",
    "doing such a calculation is however beyond the scope of our paper .    in order to assess the relevance of the last term on the right hand side in eq .  , which encodes the differences between contributions from octet and singlet soft anomalous dimensions , we computed the @xmath16 spectrum for the @xmath109 channel with and without this term .",
    "we found an effect ranging from 8% enhancement with this term included at lower @xmath16 to about 10% at higher @xmath16 .",
    "for the octet @xmath102 channel we found the enhancement over the singlet - only to be 12 to 15% .",
    "turning now to the bottom quark @xmath16 spectrum , we took as kinematic conditions , for illustrative purposes , @xmath151 collisions at the hera - b cm energy ( @xmath152 gev ) . in these settings",
    "the gluon channel is more dominant , and effects of joint resummation are more noticeable than for top production in the above .",

    "the @xmath147-factors are large ( which is not unusual @xcite for this kinematical configuration ) , with a clear distinction between threshold and joint resummation .",
    "the @xmath9 profile of the enhancement at two values of @xmath16 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile_gg_b ] .",
    "here is there no divergence , because the bound eq .",
    "is simply not reached .",
    "in this paper we derived the joint threshold and recoil resummed heavy quark transverse momentum distributions , to nll accuracy . as a corollary we obtained the pure threshold resummed result as well",
    "the resummed distributions contain two mutually incoherent components , associated with different color states ( singlet and octet ) of the heavy quark pair .",
    "these components differ by their underlying born process and by anomalous dimensions governing the pattern of wide - angle soft emission .",
    "we provided a probabilistic interpretation of these anomalous dimensions .    for top quark production at the tevatron , and bottom quark production at hera - b",
    ", we studied the dependence of these results on the color state , and the difference with threshold - resummation .",
    "we found that joint resummation gives results noticeably different from threshold resummation , and that for a realistic range of transverse momentum the kinematic singularity present in the formalism , which is very visible in applications to massless ( e.g. prompt photon ) particle @xmath16 spectra , is well - screened by the heavy quark mass .",
    "not surprisingly , resummation effects are larger in the @xmath102 channel than the @xmath101 channel , and more noticeable for bottom - quark spectra at hera - b than top - quark spectra at the tevatron .",
    "the effect of the pure octet part of the anomalous dimension is noticeable .",
    "we hope that this study , taken together with recent other ones @xcite contributes to developing joint resummation as a viable framework for making qcd predictions .",
