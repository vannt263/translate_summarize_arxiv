    "recently , friaca & terlevich ( 1999 ) use their chemodynamical model to propose that an early stage ( the first gyr ) of intense star formation in the evolution of massive spheroids could be identified as lbgs .",
    "however , sawicki & yee ( 1998 ) argued that lbgs could be very young stellar populations with the age less than 0.2gyr based on the broadband optical and ir spectral energy distributions .",
    "this is also supported by the work of ouchi & yamada ( 1999 ) based on the expected sub - mm emission and dust properties .",
    "it is worthy of noting that the assumptions about the intrinsic lbg spectral shape and the reddening curve play important roles in these results .    in this paper , we study how star formation and chemical enrichment may have proceeded in the lbg population .",
    "as we will demonstrate in section 2 , the observed star formation rate at @xmath0 requires a self - regulating process to keep the gas supply for a sufficiently long time",
    ". we will show ( in section 2 ) that such a process can be achieved by the balance between the energy feedback from star formation and gas cooling .",

    "as described in mmwb , the observed properties of lbgs can be well reproduced if they are assumed to be the central galaxies formed in the most massive haloes with relatively small spins at @xmath0 . as in mmwb , we assume that gas in a dark halo initially settles into a disk with exponential surface density profile",

    "assign a star formation rate to each halo . as in mmwb",
    ", we select lbgs as the galaxies with the highest star formation rate , so that the comoving number density for lbgs is equal to the observed value , @xmath41 for the assumed cosmology at @xmath42 , as given in adelberger et al .",
    "here it is worth noting that the model selection of lbgs we adopted is without the dust extinction being considered .",
    "this implies that the contribution of the dust is assumed to be uniform .",
    "but in fact , it could be very different from galaxies to galaxies .",
    "so , our selection of lbgs may not have one - to - one correspondence with the observed lbgs ( baugh et al .",
    "1999 ) , but the selection should be correct on average .      what regulates the amount of star - forming gas in a dark halo ?",
    "in the standard hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation ( e.g. white & rees 1978 ; white & frenk 1991 , hereafter wf ) , gas in a dark matter halo is assumed to be shock heated to the virial temperature , t=2.24 10 ^ 6k ( v_c250kms^-1)^2 , as the halo collapses and virializes .",
    "the hot gas then cools and settles into the halo centre to form stars . as suggested in wf , the amount of cold gas available for star formation in a dark halo",
    "is either limited by gas infall or by gas cooling , depending on the mass of the halo .",
    "for the massive haloes ( @xmath43 ) we are interested here , gas cooling rate is smaller than gas - infall rate , and the supply of star - forming gas is limited by gas cooling ( see wf for details ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that gas cooling is the main process that constantly regulates the sfr in lbgs .    to have a quantitative assessment ,",
    "let us compare different rates involved in the problem .",
    "using equations ( 1)-(4 ) we can write the sfr as @xmath44^{-0.6 } { \\rm m_{\\odot}\\,yr ^{-1}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the current gas content of the disk .",
    "the rate at which gas is consumed by star formation is therefore _",
    "sfr=(1-r_r ) m _ , where @xmath45 is the returned fraction of stellar mass into the ism ; we take @xmath46 for a salpeter imf ( e.g. madau et al .",
    "according to wf , the heating rate due to supernova explosions under the approximation of instantaneous recycling can be written as = _ 0m_(700kms^-1)^2 , where @xmath47 is an efficiency parameter which is still very uncertain .",
    "we take it to be @xmath48 as in wf .",
    "the rate at which gas is heated up ( to the virial temperature ) is therefore m_heat=0.8 v_c^2de t which is the same form as equation ( 9 ) of kauffmann ( 1996 ; see also somerville 1997 ) . at @xmath42 and for the cosmology considered here , this rate can be written as [ mheat ] m_heat 29.2h^-0.6 ( m_d0.05)^1.4 ( 0.05)^-0.8(v_c)^1.4 ^-0.6 m_yr^-1 . comparing this equation with equations ( 7 ) and",
    "( 8) , we can find that the rate for gas consumption due to star formation is much larger than the rate of gas heating for lbg halos . because lbgs are hosted by massive halos which have large circular velocities @xmath49 ,",
    "the halos are cooling dominated which is confirmed during the detailed calculation below .",
    "following wf we define a mass cooling rate by m_cool=4_gas(r_cool)r_cool^2 dr_cool , where @xmath50 is the cooling radius and @xmath51 is the density profile of the hot gas in the halo . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that @xmath52 , and we define @xmath50 to be the radius at which the cooling time is equal to the age of the universe , which is similar to the time interval between major mergers of haloes ( lacey & cole 1994 ) . the density distribution of the halo mass here is assumed to be isothermal . however , it is the nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white , 1997 ) in mmwb . because the difference of the resulted cooling rates between these two different choices of density profiles is small ( zhao et al , 1999 ) , and",
    "the major goal here is to show whether or not the cooling - regulated star formation can be valid , the adoption of isothermal profile will not influence the final result very much .    under this definition",
    ", gas within the cooling radius can cool effectively before the halo merges into a larger system where it may be heated up to the new virial temperature if it is not converted into stars . using the cooling function given by binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) where cooling function @xmath53 in the range of @xmath54 ( and assuming gas with primordial composition )",
    ", the mass cooling rate can then be written as [ mcool ] m_cool 49.8 h^1/2(v_c)^2 ( f_b)^3/2 m_yr^-1 .",
    "if @xmath55 is smaller than @xmath56 , then cold gas will accumulate in the halo centre and lead to higher star formation rate .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath57 , the amount of cold gas will be reduced by star formation and supernova heating , leading to a lower star formation rate .",
    "we therefore assume that there is a rough balance among these three rates : [ balance ] m_cool .",
    "it should be noted that the cooling - regulated star formation process is only a reasonable hypothesis , and the real situation must be much more complicated . for example , during a major merger of galactic haloes , the amount of gas that can cool must be much larger than that given by the cooling argument , and the star formation may be in a short burst ( e.g. mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "however , such bursts are not expected to dominate the observed lbg population , because of their brief lifetimes .",
    "thus , star formation rates in the majority of lbgs are expected to be regulated by equation ( 14 ) on average .",
    "as shown in mmwb , to match the observed number density of lbgs , the median value of @xmath22 is about @xmath58 in the present cosmogony .",
    "the typical star formation rate is of the order @xmath59 .",
    "this is not very different from the observed star formation rates , albeit dust distinction in the observations may be difficult to quantify .    = 9.5 cm    figure 1 shows the value of @xmath16 required by the balance condition equation ( 14 ) as a function of halo circular velocity , assuming that @xmath60 and the left hand side exactly equals to the right hand ones in equation ( 14 ) .",
    "results are shown for two choices of spin parameters , @xmath61 and 0.08 , corresponding to the 50 and 90 percent points of the @xmath18 distribution for the lbg population ( mmwb ) .",
    "as one can see , for the majority of lbg hosts , gas cooling indeed regulates the values of @xmath16 to the range from 0.02 to 0.04 .",
    "so , we can reasonably choose @xmath62 for the lbg population as mmwb did .",
    "since the cooling time is approximately the age of the universe at @xmath63 , cooling regulation ensures that star formation at the predicted rate can last over a large portion of a hubble time .",
    "since the cooling regulation discussed above gives specific predictions of how star formation may have proceeded in lbgs , here we use this model to predict the properties of the lbg population .",
    "the condition in equation ( 14 ) implies that the star formation rate in a disk is equal to the rate of gas infall ( due to a balance between cooling and heating ) .",
    "thus the evolution of the gas in the disk of an lbg host halo is described by the standard chemical evolution model with infall rate equal to star formation rate , i.e. , the new infalling gas to the disk distributed radially in an exponential form with the scale length of @xmath64 , and the reheated gas removed decreases with the increasing radius due to the decreasing sfr . under the instantaneous recycling approximation ( tinsley 1980 )",
    ", the gas metallicity @xmath65 is given by [ metallicity ] z = y(1-e^-)+z_i ,   = _ tot_gas-1 , where @xmath66 is the initial metallicity of the infalling gas , @xmath67 is the stellar chemical yield , @xmath27 is the gas surface density ( which is kept constant by gas infall ) and @xmath68 is the total mass surface density , which increases as star formation proceeds : = ( 1-r_r)_sfr . here the enrichment of the halo hot gases is not taken into account because the amount of metals heated up to the halos by sns is relatively smaller than that of primordial gases .",
    "figure 2 shows the star formation rate as a function of halo circular velocity @xmath17 and spin parameter @xmath18 .",
    "as expected , the predicted sfr increases with @xmath22 but decreases with @xmath18 . as we can see from the figure , if we define systems with @xmath69 ( which matches the sfrs for the observed lbg population ) to be lbgs , the majority of their host haloes must have @xmath70 which are cooling dominated .",
    "this result is the same as that obtained by mmwb based on the observed number density and clustering of lbgs .",
    "thus , the star formation rate based on cooling argument is also consistent with the observed number density and clustering . because sfr is higher in a system with smaller @xmath18 , the lbg population",
    "are biased towards haloes with small spins , but given its relatively narrow distribution , this bias is not very strong .",
    "= 9.5 cm    the predicted metallicity gradients on individual disks are shown in figure 3 for two different choices of star formation time scale @xmath15 of 0.5gyr and 1gyr respectively , where we assume that @xmath71 and @xmath72 in order to make the predictions easily compare with observations .",
    "the metallicity gradients are negative in all cases .",
    "when radius is measured in disk scale length , the predicted metallicity depends weakly on @xmath22 but strongly on @xmath18 , and is higher for a longer star formation time .",
    "as one can see from equation ( 15 ) , the largest metallicity in the model is @xmath73 .",
    "this metallicity can be achieved in the inner part of compact disks ( with small @xmath18 ) when star formation time @xmath74 gyr .",
    "the metallicity drops by a factor of @xmath75 from its central value at @xmath76 .",
    "since the distribution of haloes with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath18 are known , we can generate monte - carlo samples of the halo distribution in the @xmath22-@xmath18 plane at any given redshift .",
    "we can then use the galaxy formation model ( mmwb ) discussed above to transform the halo population into an lbg population based on lbgs with highest sfrs which is the same as that outlined in sec .",
    "= 9.0 cm    we define the typical metallicity of a galaxy as the one at its effective radius .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution of this metallicity for two choices of the star formation time , @xmath77 gyr and 1 gyr . just as the same reason as figure 3 in last section",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath71 and @xmath72 in order to make the predictions easily compare with observations .",
    "the median values of @xmath78 are 0.60 and 0.84 for @xmath79 gyr and 1 gyr , respectively .",
    "the sharp truncation at @xmath80 is due to the fact that this quantity has a maximum value of 1 in the present chemical evolution model .",
    "it can be inferred form figure 3 that the range in @xmath78 decreases with increasing star formation time .",
    "thus , if gas infall lasts for a long enough time , the distribution in @xmath78 will be very narrow near 1 and all lbgs will have metallicity @xmath73 . according to the works of tinsley ( 1980 ) and maeder ( 1992 ) , the stellar yield @xmath67 is the order of @xmath81 for the salpeter imf . if we adopt a stellar yield @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and if lbgs are not short bursts ( e.g. @xmath84 gyr ) then their metallicity will be @xmath85 which is similar to that proposed by pettini ( 1999 ) .",
    "= 9.5 cm    the predicted distribution of effective radii for the lbg population is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the distribution is similar to that of mmwb .",
    "the predicted range is @xmath86 with a median value of 2.5 @xmath87kpc .",
    "note that the effective radii in the cooling - regulated model are independent of the star formation time @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "( 1996 ) which are mentioned above .",

    "the median values are 180@xmath88 for the model and spans from 100 to 500@xmath89 . to compare with observations",
    ", we have to take into account the effect of dust .",
    "if we apply an average factor of 3 in dust extinction , then the predictions closely match the values derived from infrared observations by pettini , et al .",
    "( 1998 ) although there might exist rare lbgs with very high sfr .",
    "= 9.5 cm      since the virial temperature of lbg haloes are quite high , in the range of @xmath90k , significant soft x - ray and hard uv photons may be emitted as the halo hot gas cools .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine whether the lbg population can make substantial contribution to the soft x - ray and uv backgrounds .    the dominant cooling mechanism for hot gas with temperature @xmath91 k is the thermal bremsstrahlung .",

    "we write the total luminosity @xmath95 in thermal bremsstrahlung as l_b = v_c^2 , and we take @xmath96 here as wf so that @xmath95 is equal to the initial thermal energy in the cooling gas .",

    ", the soft x - ray contribution from lbgs could be a substantial fraction ( about 20% ) of the total soft x - ray background .",

    "based on the recent observational results of the cosmic star formation history , pettini ( 1999 ) obtained a predicted total mass of metals produced at @xmath103 . after combining results of",
    "all contributors observed , he argued that there seems to exist a very serious  missing metal \" problem , i.e. , the predicted result is much higher than observed ones .",
    "so , it is interesting to evaluate the total metals produced by lbgs in our model .    according to the method we select lbgs to be the galaxies with highest sfr and our chemical evolution model mentioned in sec .",

    "the metallicities for the damped lyman - alpha absorption systems expected from the lbg population are lower than those for the lbgs themselves , although high metallicity is expected for a small number of sightlines going through the central regions of an lbg . at the same time , our modeled contribution to the total metal is roughly consistent with that obtained from the observed cosmic star formation history , i.e. , there might not exist so - called  missing metal \" problem although there could be more than half of the metals to be in the hot phase .",
    "finally , a prediction of our model is that lbg haloes are filled with hot gas . as a result",
    ", these galaxies may have a non - negligible contribution to the soft x - ray background .",
    "the contribution of lbgs to the ionizing uv background is found to be small .",
    "there are two basic assumptions in our work .",
    "one is that the lbg population is one - to - one associated with the most massive halos which are generated from the ps formalism , as done by mmwb ; another is that the timescale of star formation for lbg population is assumed to be the order of 1gyr , which is suggested by steidel et al .",
    "( 1999a , b , 1995 ) . however , baugh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently argue that the prediction of the clustering properties of lbgs based on this first simple assumption will be discrepancy with the results of more detailed semi - analytic models .",
    "still , the second will lead to difficulty in reproducing the redshift evolution of bright galaxies ( kolatt et al .",
    "more detailed modelling done by somerville ( 1997 ) suggest the collisional starbursts could be expected to be an important effect in understanding the lbgs .",
    "so , further observations are required to investigate the intrinsic properties of lbgs .",
