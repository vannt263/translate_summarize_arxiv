    "in some solids thermal energy can be transmitted by the mechanism of _ wave - like _ propagation of heat , unlike the usual mechanism of conduction by diffusion .",
    "this phenomenon of heat conduction as waves , known as _ second sound _ , has been observed experimentally ( see , for example , @xcite for an extensive survey of experimental works involving propagation of heat as a thermal wave ) .    the classical theory of heat conduction based on _ fourier s law _",
    ", fails to model the second sound phenomenon .",
    "moreover , the classical theory permits _ infinite speed _ of propagation of parts of a localized initial heat pulse , which is paradoxical from a physical point of view . as a result",
    ", efforts have been made in an attempt to find a consistent model of heat propagation that is capable of capturing the second sound phenomenon with finite speed ( see , for example , @xcite for a review of models of heat conduction as waves ) .",
    "one of the alternative theory for formulating the propagation of heat in a general way that aims at capturing the second sound phenomenon was proposed by green and naghdi @xcite .",
    "the theory of green and naghdi is based on three types of constitutive relations for the heat flux : type i is equivalent to the classical theory based on fourier s law .",
    "type ii permits the propagation of a localized heat signal as thermal wave without dissipation ( see @xcite for a remark on the appropriateness of this classification ) .",
    "type iii is the most general theory , which includes both type i and ii as special cases , in which second sound phenomenon is supported while dissipation is incorporated in the process .",
    "the thermomechanical coupling of non - classical heat conduction with classical elasticity is the subject of non - classical thermoelasticity .",
    "extensive overviews of the non - classical thermoelasticity of green and naghdi can be found in @xcite .",
    "theoretical results concerning the non - classical theory have been addressed in several research works . in @xcite exact solutions",
    "are obtained for thermal wave propagation in one dimension .",
    "results on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of non - classical problem of thermoelasticity can be found , for example , in @xcite and the references therein .    designing a robust and efficient numerical solution strategy for strongly coupled problems of hyperbolic - type is challenging .",
    "this is particularly the case for the non - classical theory of thermoelasticity where hyperbolic ( or nearly hyperbolic ) heat conduction equation is coupled with the classical hyperbolic elasticity problem .",
    "a standard approach for solving such time - dependent problems is the method of lines ( mol ) in which the governing partial differential equation is first discretised in space using the finite element method ( fem ) leading to a system of ordinary differential equations , which can then be solved using the finite difference method . despite its popularity",
    ", mol struggles to accurately solve problems involving propagation of sharp gradients or discontinuities @xcite .",
    "recently , a great deal of attention has been invested in designing a spatial discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) approach for convection - dominated problems ; see for example @xcite .",
    "however , these methods , like mol , are based on decoupling space and time in the sense that space and time are treated differently .",
    "hulbert and hughes @xcite introduced a powerful scheme based on a space - time dg finite element methodology for linear elastodynamics problems . in their approach , space and time are treated simultaneously and the unknown fields are allowed to be discontinuous in time while continuous in space . recently",
    ", the space - time dg method has been used in @xcite for classical thermoelasticity , using a monolithic approach where all the unknown fields are solved for simultaneously .",
    "recently , in @xcite a numerical solution approach based on mol was proposed for non - classical thermoelasticity in which time integration was done in two ways : continuous galerkin fem for type ii and iii , while mixed - discountinuous galerkin fem for the classical problem based on the fourier s law of heat conduction . in their approach",
    "a streamline - upwind numerical stabilization was added to localize numerical oscillations due to the propagation of sharp thermal wave .    in the current work , we extend the existence and uniqueness results otained in @xcite for type ii theory to the more general problem of type iii thermoelasticity .",
    "we also present a novel numerical algorithm for the non - classical thermoelasticity based on an operator - splitting technique motivated by armero and simo @xcite for classical thermoelasticity , coupled with a space - time dg methodology that extends the work of hulbert and hughes @xcite which was formulated for linear elastodynamics .",
    "the major contributions of this work are twofold : ( i ) the adaptation of the operator - splitting strategy for classical thermoelasticity first proposed by @xcite to the non - standard theory , in which the operator defining non - standard thermoelasticity is split in a way that the resulting sub - operators retain the same contractive behaviour as the global operator ; and ( ii ) the time - dg formulation in which continuity of the unknown fields is enforced weakly by using an @xmath0-inner product in contrast to the energy - norm used in @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : gnt ] , the governing equations of the non - classical theory are summarized in a general framework of type iii thermoelasticity .",
    "well - posedness and physically meaningful boundary and initial conditions are also discussed in this section .",
    "an operator - splitting strategy for the problem of type iii thermoelasticity is proposed and the resulting sub - operators are analysed in section  [ sec : alg - os ] . in section",
    "[ sec : t - dg ] , time - dg formulation is proposed for the sub - problems and stability of the individual algorithms and the global one is analysed in detail . a number of numerical examples both in 1d and 2d are presented in section  [ sec : numresults ] to demonstrate the excellent performance and capability of the proposed numerical scheme . finally , concluding remarks and some open problems are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this section summarizes the equations governing the non - classical theory of thermoelasticty of type iii as proposed by green and naghdi .",
    "well - posedness of the problem is analysed .",

    "* under the assumption of mechanical and thermal isotropy the elasticity tensor @xmath20 , and the tensors @xmath29 and @xmath30 become @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the forth - order identity tensor , and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are constants . * the free energy @xmath38 , and hence the stress tensor @xmath39 and the entropy density @xmath40",

    "the problem is well - defined and contractive .",
    "this also means that the dynamical system represented by the equation of non - classical thermoelasticity of type iii is , in general , stable in the sense of lyapunov .",
    "consider an abstract evolutionary problem of the form .",

    "a time - stepping algorithm , @xmath132 , for the global problem is obtained by taking products of the algorithms as @xmath133 the algorithm @xmath132 is referred to as _ lie - trotter - kato product formula _",

    "it means that @xmath132 is only first order accurate .",
    "higher - order algorithms based on operator - splitting strategies include : @xmath136 the marchuk  strang split is second - order accurate , while the double - pass split is only first - order . note that lie - trotter - kato product formula depends on the order of operations , for example in , @xmath137 is applied first followed by @xmath138 , while the order of operations does not matter in the other two operator - splitting algorithms given in .",
    "the non - classical theory of thermoelasticity is a coupling of two dynamical systems : the classical linear elasticity and the non - fourier thermal conduction .",
    "a naive splitting of the system into a mechanical problem under constant thermal states ( isothermal ) and a thermal problem with a fixed configuration will result in at most a conditionally stable algorithm even if the sub - algorithms for the two processes are unconditionally stable @xcite . rather , care must be taken in splitting the two systems ; this is usually dictated by an understanding of the underlying physics . in this respect , it makes sense if we split the operator @xmath69 in so that in the mechanical phase the entropy is held fixed ( isentropic ) while the temperature is allowed to vary , and in the thermal phase heat is allowed to be conducted while the configuration is fixed . in fact , in this split , it can be shown that each sub - process defines an evolution problem which is contractive , as is the global problem .",
