    "we consider a two - dimensional langevin simulation of a system of size @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath1 and @xmath2-directions . in order to potentially accommodate a triangular lattice , we take @xmath3 and @xmath4 . within the system we place @xmath5 interacting particles at a density @xmath6 . in previous simulations we held the system size fixed and either varied the density by changing @xmath5 or varied the relative strength of the attractive and repulsive particle interactions . here",
    "we hold the particle - particle interaction strength fixed and fix @xmath7 but vary @xmath8 in order to alter the density .",
    "the initial particle positions are obtained using simulated annealing .",
    "the dynamics of a single particle @xmath9 obeys the following classical equation of motion : @xmath10 the particle - particle interaction has the following form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the distance between particles located at @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the first term is a coulomb repulsion , meaning that for very short distances the interaction is repulsive and the particles will not collapse to a point .",
    "the magnitude of the fluctuations experienced by the particles during the course of the simulation is such that @xmath15 never drops below the minimum value @xmath16 . due to the long range nature of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "it is not possible to cut off the interaction range , so we use a lekner real - space summation method to compute the long range term @xcite .",
    "the second term is a short range attraction of yukawa form with an inverse screening length of @xmath17 and with @xmath18 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "1 is the random fluctuation force from finite temperature which has the following temporal correlations : @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "1(a - j ) we plot the particle positions after simulated annealing in the low density regime @xmath21 to @xmath22 . at the lowest density @xmath21 in fig .",
    "1(a ) , a mixture of clumps appears where there are two to three particles in each clump along with a smaller number of individual particles .",
    "the number of particles per clump increases with increasing @xmath23 so that at @xmath24 , for example , there are six particles per clump on average .",
    "the decrease in the number of particles per clump with decreasing density that we find at the lowest densities suggests that for even lower density than we have considered , the limit of only one particle per clump would occur and a triangular lattice would form .",
    "the system failed to form an ordered ground state at the lowest densities we considered even for a very slow simulated annealing procedure .",
    "this results from the very strong clumping tendency induced by the short range attraction combined with the relatively large inter - clump distances at these densities .",
    "particles are strongly attracted into clumps , but the difference in energy at larger scales between having a clump with @xmath25 particles or @xmath26 particles is too small to permit the particles that have already fallen into a clump to escape from the strong short - range attraction of the clump in order to form clumps of uniform size .",
    "the resulting polydispersity in clump size prevents the clumps from ordering into a larger - scale lattice .",
    "since the long - range coulomb repulsion favors a triangular ordering of the clumps , the problem of trying to order a mixture of clumps of slightly different sizes has similarities to the filling of magnetic flux quanta at submatching fields on a triangular pinning array in a superconductor @xcite . at matching fillings where the number of flux quanta is an integer multiple @xmath27 of the number of holes , such as at @xmath28 , @xmath29 , or @xmath30 , with @xmath25 integer , a triangular flux lattice forms ; however , at non - integer fillings , most of the configurations are highly degenerate and disordered states appear , such as at @xmath31 . at other fields such as @xmath32 , where an ordered tiling of the triangular lattice is possible",
    ", the ground state has several degenerate orientations , so any ordered state that forms is very likely to contain grain boundaries .",
    "analogously , in our system a possible partial ordering could be expected for a low density filling where 1/3 of the clumps capture @xmath33 particles and the remaining @xmath34 of the clumps contain @xmath25 particles . in superconducting network systems of the type considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the triangular ordering favored by the repulsive vortex - vortex interactions is strongly enhanced by the ordered substrate . in our system , the clumps move over a substrate - free continuum , which adds even more degeneracy to the system and makes it very difficult to observe ordered states . even though there is a difference of only one or two particles in the number of particles in neighboring clumps ,",
    "the polydispersity of clump sizes is largest at the lowest densities we consider , where the charge ratio between neighboring clumps can be as large as @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "it is known that large polydispersity in the particle interactions for two dimensional systems can lead to the formation of a disordered state @xcite .        at higher densities where the clumps contain larger numbers of particles ,",
    "the difference in the number of particles in neighboring clumps is still only one or two particles . as a result ,",
    "the effective polydispersity drops significantly and the system crosses over to a limit where each clump has close to the same charge .",
    "this tendency for the clumps to have more triangular ordering as the clumps grow in size is clearly observable for @xmath37 in fig .  1(i , j ) and for @xmath38 in fig .",
    "2(a - c ) , where the center of masses of the clumps form a triangular lattice . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for colloidal systems with shorter range interactions , a larger polydispersity in the clump sizes appeared ; however , the clumps formed an ordered triangular state whenever all of the clumps contained six or more particles . in the short range ,",
    "purely repulsively interacting soft - sphere system of ref .",
    "@xcite , triangular ordering also appeared even for polydisperse clumps as long as the number of particles per clump was six or greater .",
    "simulations of a mixed dimer and trimer clump state in a system with a two - step repulsive interaction produced disordered states very similar to the ones we observe @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that clump states with small numbers of particles are generally disordered independent of the exact details of the particle - particle interaction potential , while clump states with larger numbers of particles per clump tend to form triangularly ordered structures .",
    "figures 1 and 2 indicate that the clump states form for @xmath39 . as the clusters grow in size with increasing density",
    ", we find that there is a tendency for clusters with certain `` magic '' numbers of particles to appear more often than clusters with non - magic particle numbers . in studies of isolated clusters of particles with the same interaction potential ,",

    "rapid quench rates , different domains of stripe orientation can arise leading to a partially ordered stripe state ; however , for sufficiently slow quench rates , the lower energy aligned stripe states can form .",

    "additionally , studies of small numbers of particles in individual traps also indicate that the onset of rotational and translational disordering is affected by the number of particles in the trap and the degree of order in their arrangement @xcite . for our clump system",
    ", this implies that if all the clumps had the same number of particles and each clump was also well ordered internally , such as for @xmath41 particles per clump , a well defined transition from a frozen clump phase to an intra - clump liquid phase should occur . in our system ,",
    "not all the clumps have the same number of particles and some clumps contain particle numbers which produce less stable internal clump structures ; therefore , our sample shows disorder at lower temperatures which smears out the transition to the intra - clump liquid .    in fig .",

    "if we follow the trajectory of a single particle , we observe that it remains trapped within a single clump for a period of time , diffusing within that clump , before escaping from the clump and undergoing much more rapid diffusion until it is trapped by another clump .",
    "this type of motion is very similar to the caging dynamics seen in certain glassy systems where particles can locally diffuse in some region with an occasional long hop to another region where the particle again undergoes localized diffusion . at very short times",
    ", the behavior appears purely diffusive when the particles have not had enough time to experience the confining boundaries of the clump . at intermediate times",

    "the clump phase shows strong density inhomogeneities in the liquid state that decrease in size and lifetime with increasing temperature . in the anticlump phase , the liquid state found above melting is much more homogeneous and as a result the fluctuations in the energy are much smaller for the anticlump system above melting than for the stripe or clump phases .",
    "we also find a uniform density liquid for the higher density uniform regime above its melting temperature ( not shown ) .",
    "these results indicate that the clump , stripe , and anticlump phase all exhibit an intermediate fluid phase , where the internal ordering of individual particles is lost and selective diffusion can occur while the overall structure of the clump , stripe , or anticlump pattern remains intact .",
    "one of our main findings is that the competing long - range repulsive and short - range attractive interactions produce a system that can exhibit both solid and liquid behavior simultaneously .",
    "the liquid - like behavior occurs on the short length scale of the spacing between individual particles .",
    "motion on this small length scale initiates at temperatures well below the temperature at which the large scale patterns formed by the particles break apart .",
    "future studies of the impact of the coexisting liquid and solid behavior could include determining how the existence of the two length scales affects measurable time scales .",
    "for example , the short - scale liquid could be probed with short - time measurements while the larger - scale solid state could be accessed using longer time measurements .",
    "the liquid - like nature of the system on short length scales might also play a role in permitting the system to adapt itself easily to a substrate or to an applied external field .",
    "for example , the ordering of a large length scale might be disrupted by quenched disorder in a system that had no short length scale degrees of freedom , whereas in our competing interaction system , the effect of the disorder could be compensated on the short length scale , permitting the large length scale ordering to be maintained intact .",
    "in essence , the existence of the short length scale degrees of freedom permits a screening of the disorder on the larger length scale .",
    "it would also be interesting to see which of the phases we observe , such as clump , stripe , or anticlump , is more adaptable to quenched disorder in this sense .",
    "our system may have interesting connections to other types of disordered systems which exhibit liquid - like behaviors on some length and time scales but solid - like behaviors on other length and time scales .",
    "for example , glassy systems have properties that are in some sense inverted from what we observe , since glasses have liquid - like behavior on long length and time scales but solid - like behavior on short time and length scales .",
    "the time and length scale separation produced by competing interactions has clear potential for controlling novel functionality in materials , particularly those materials which contain additional degrees of freedom such as electronic , magnetic , superconducting , optical , biological , and so forth .",
    "the competing interactions can achieve a low - dimensional confinement of active regions , such as our short length scale liquid , embedded in a self - consistent supporting matrix , such as our larger length scale solid .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the different types of phases that can occur in a two - dimensional system with a competing long - range repulsion and a short range attraction as a function of density and temperature . at zero temperature and low densities",
    ", the system forms a clump phase .",
    "the particles cluster together in clumps and , due to the long range repulsion , the clumps move as far apart from each other as possible and attempt to form a macroscopic triangular lattice . when there are few particles in each clump , the overall structure of the clump lattice is disordered due to the large charge polydispersity of the small clumps . as the number of particles in each clump increases , this polydispersity effect is reduced and a triangular clump lattice appears .",
    "in addition to the triangular ordering of the clumps , there is also a tendency for the particles within each clump to form ordered or partially ordered structures . for higher densities , there is a sharp transition into a stripe state . the particles within each stripe tend to have triangular or partial triangular ordering . at still higher densities ,",
    "a transition into an anticlump phase containing a triangular lattice of voids occurs , and at even higher densities there is a transition into a uniform phase with partial triangular ordering .",
    "we introduced several new measures to characterize the onset of the different phases as a function of density , including the calculation of the average distance to the closest neighbor .",
    "as a function of increasing temperature , we find that the stripe phase exhibits clear multiple - step melting . a frozen phase with little or no diffusion occurs at low temperature .",
    "with increasing temperature the system melts into an intra - stripe liquid , where particles diffuse along the length of the stripes but do not diffuse between stripes and the overall stripe ordering remains intact . at higher temperatures , there is an onset of stripe - to - stripe particle motion leading to anisotropic diffusion , and the stripe structure continues to persist .",
    "finally , there is a transition to an isotropic liquid where the stripe structure is destroyed and the diffusion becomes isotropic .",
    "the onset of these different regimes produces signatures in the specific heat and in the energy fluctuations .",
    "we argue that the existence of an intermediate intra - stripe liquid indicates that excess entropy can be put into the motion of particles along the stripes rather than into destruction of the overall stripe structure .",
    "the presence of excess entropy is manifested as features in the specific heat and energy fluctuations .",
    "we show that the clump and anticlump phases exhibit similar intermediate liquid regimes . in the clump phase ,",
    "the particles remain confined within the clumps but are liquidlike and mobile inside the clumps , while the clump lattice remains solid . for the anticlump phase , the particles diffuse throughout the entire lattice while the void structure remains crystalline .",

    "<S> ordered stripes can be generated when the system is driven in the presence of quenched disorder ; in this case , the stripes are aligned in the direction of the applied drive @xcite . in the absence of quenched disorder , although the particles move under an applied uniform drive they do not experience the local shearing forces which are necessary to induce the plastic deformations required to align the stripe pattern . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of a stripe - forming colloidal system with intermediate - range repulsive forces indicate that if a non - uniform drive is applied so as to create a shear in the system , then plastic deformation can arise and the stripes align in the direction of the shear @xcite . for systems with long range repulsive interactions , it is generally difficult to reach a completely ordered ground state due to the inherent heterogeneity of the system . </S>",

    "<S> we introduce several new diagnostics to characterize these states and the transitions between them . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine how the states disorder as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the stripe states are particularly useful in understanding the thermal disordering process since diffusion along the stripes can be distinguished readily from diffusion between the stripes . </S>",
