    "in recent years , the study of quantum entanglement has provided us with novel perspectives and tools to address many - body problems .",
    "progress in our understanding of many - body entanglement has resulted both in the development of efficient tensor network descriptions of many - body wavefunctions @xcite and in the identification of diagnoses for quantum criticality @xcite and topological order @xcite .",
    "measures of entanglement have played a key role in the above accomplishments .",
    "the most popular measure is the entanglement entropy @xcite , namely the von neuman entropy @xmath5 of the reduced density matrix @xmath6 of region @xmath0 , @xmath7 which is used to quantify the amount of entanglement between region @xmath0 and its complementary @xmath1 when the whole system @xmath8 is in the pure state @xmath9 .    in order to go beyond bipartite entanglement for pure states , another measure of entanglement",
    "was introduced , namely the entanglement negativity @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the entanglement negativity is used to quantify the amount of entanglement between parts @xmath0 and @xmath1 when these are in a ( possibly mixed ) state @xmath11 .",
    "one can always think of regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 as being parts of a larger system @xmath12 in a pure state @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , and therefore use the entanglement negativity to also characterize tripartite entanglement .",
    "recently , calabrese , cardy , and tonni have sparked renewed interest in the entanglement negativity through a remarkable exact calculation of its scaling in conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "similarly , an exact calculation is possible for certain systems with topological order @xcite .",
    "moreover , the negativity is easily accessible from tensor network representations @xcite and through quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we add to the above recent contributions by presenting a disentangling theorem for the entanglement negativity .",
    "this technical theorem allows us to use the negativity to learn about the structure of a many - body wave - function .",
    "the theorem states that if and only if the negativity @xmath15 between parts @xmath0 and @xmath16 of a system @xmath12 in a pure state @xmath13 does not decrease when we trace out part @xmath2 , that is , if and only if @xmath17 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : abc ] , then it is possible to factorize the vector space @xmath18 of part @xmath1 as @xmath19 ( direct sum with an irrelevant subspace ) in such a way that the state @xmath20 itself factorizes as @xmath21 this is a remarkable result .",
    "notice that one can come up with many different measures of entanglement for mixed states ( most of which may be very hard to compute ) .",
    "these measures of entanglement will in general differ from each other and from the negativity for particular states , and it is often hard to attach a physical meaning to the concrete value an entanglement measure takes . [ for instance , in the case of the logarithmic negativity , we only know that it is an upper bound to how much pure - state entanglement one can distill from the mixed state @xcite ]",
    ". however , the disentangling theorem tells us that through a calculation of the entanglement negativity we can learn whether the wave - function factorizes as in eq . [ eq : factorization ] .",
    "that is , we are not just able to use the entanglement negativity to attach a number to the amount of mixed - state entanglement , but we are also able to learn about the intrincate structure of the many - body wave - function . in some sense , this theorem is analogous to hayden et al.s necessary and sufficient conditions for the saturation of the strong subadditivity inequality for the von neumann entropy @xcite , a beautiful result with deep implications in quantum information theory .    we also present a numerical study of monogamy that puts the above disentangling theorem in a broader perspective .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : factorization ] that state @xmath13 has no entanglement between parts @xmath0 and @xmath2 , so that @xmath22 .",
    "that is , the disentangling theorem refers to a setting where the entanglement negativity fulfills the monogamy relation , @xmath23 ( for the particular case @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have seen numerically that the entanglement negativity does not fulfill the monogamy condition of eq .",
    "[ eq : monogamy ] .",
    "however , we have also found that the square of the negativity entanglement negativity satisfies the monogamy relation : @xmath25 for the particular case of a three - qubit system , this result had been previously proved analytically by ou and fan @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is divided into sections as follows .",
    "first in sect .",
    "ii we review the entanglement negativity . then in sect .",
    "iii we present and prove the disentangling theorem and discuss two simple corollaries .",

    "we thus focus on proving the opposite direction . for the sake of clearness ,",
    "the proof is divided into three steps : ( a ) preparation ; ( b ) orthogonal condition ; ( c ) factorization .",

    "with respect to this decomposition , state @xmath13 factorizes as @xmath138 where @xmath139 this completes the proof",

    "corollary 4 implies that , in the specific context of the tripartite pure states addressed by the disentangling theorem , the entanglement negativity ( somewhat trivially ) satisfies the relation , @xmath161 for the particular case @xmath141 , which saturates the inequality .",
    "if it was correct , then this inequality would tell us the following : when measuring entanglement by means of the squared negativity @xmath162 , if part @xmath0 is very entangled with part @xmath1 , then part @xmath0 can not be at the same time very entangled with part @xmath2 .",
    "[ eq : monogamy ] is reminiscent of ( and motivated by ) the famous coffman - kundu - wootters monogamy inequality @xcite for another measure of entanglement , the concurrence @xmath163 @xcite , which satisfies @xmath164 according to this inequality , if @xmath165 approaches @xmath166 , then @xmath167 is necessarily small , which is used to say that entanglement is monogamous : if @xmath0 is very entangled with @xmath1 , then it can not be simultaneously very entangled with @xmath2 .",
    "however , the concurrence @xmath163 is only defined on qubits , and therefore of rather limited use . thus in this section",

    "this is a concern , because it means that we are not properly exploring the states near the saturation line , which are the ones that could violate the inequality . for this purpose",
