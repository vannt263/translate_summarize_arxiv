    "it is natural to suspect that invariants constructed from the riemann tensor via contractions . ]",
    "should play some important role in general relativity .",
    "however , it is only fair to say that this importance has yet to be fully realized .",
    "for example , it has been known for a very long time that this type of invariant fails to distinguish inequivalent spacetimes @xcite .",
    "indeed , the inclusion of derivatives of the riemann tensor does not overcome this shortcoming @xcite .",
    "the inequivalence problem requires a more sophisticated approach ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "invariants are of some use in the study of spacetime singularities ( distinguishing the scalar polynomial ( _ sp _ ) type ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) which is equivalent to a curvature _ pp _ type @xcite ) , but even here they fail to distinguish shell crossings from more significant singularities .    despite these shortcomings , the problem of finding a complete set of invariants for spacetime has attracted considerable recent effort @xcite . here",
    "we set out to study spacetimes which are the product of two 2-dimensional spaces , one lorentzian and one riemannian , subject to a separability condition on the function which couples the 2-spaces .",
    "that is , we consider metrics of the form @xmath1 subject to the restriction @xmath11 the spaces are known as warped products of class b @xcite , with @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) for class @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 for class @xmath9 .",
    "a metric of sufficient generality for class @xmath6 is given by in conformally flat form for class @xmath6 . ] ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) @xmath12 and for class @xmath9 by @xmath13 there are many examples of class @xmath14 spacetimes ( for example , _ all _ spherical , plane , and hyperbolic spacetimes ) .",
    "examples of spacetimes of class @xmath15 are considerably harder to find .",
    "it is known that the only physically interesting energy - momentum types of class @xmath15 spacetimes are non - null electromagnetic , @xmath16-term , or vacuum @xcite .",
    "for a general petrov type d metric , we can align the tetrad along the principle null directions of the weyl tensor to find a frame in which there are in general 12 non - zero components of the curvature ( complex @xmath17 , the ricci spinor components , and the ricci scalar ) .",
    "since this alignment leaves a two parameter group of rotational freedom in the frame ( ` spin ' and ` boost ' ) , the number of independent invariants for a type d spacetime is reduced by this dimension to 10 .    specializing to the given class of spacetimes",
    ", we find that if the above frame alignment is carried out , then a number of the ricci spinor components are also reduced to zero . for class @xmath18",
    "we are left with the real components @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , while for class @xmath22 , only @xmath20 and @xmath23 remain non - zero . the number of independent degrees of freedom arising from the ricci components is thus reduced to 3 .",
    "however , one of these degrees can be removed by making use of either the spin ( for @xmath18 ) or boost ( for @xmath22 ) freedoms still remaining in the frame .",
    "the number of independent invariants that we should expect to find for the given class of spacetime is thus @xmath24 corresponding respectively to the weyl and ricci spinor freedoms , the ricci scalar , and the dimension of the invariance group of these spinors .",
    "an example of how the details of this calculation can be carried out using _ grtensorii _ is given in appendix a.",
    "the invariants we begin with here are the sixteen suggested by carminati and mclenaghan @xcite augmented with an invariant equivalent to @xmath25 suggested recently by zakhary and mcintosh @xcite . , where @xmath26 is the trace - free ricci tensor , and @xmath27 is the metric tensor , the characteristic polynomial which follows is @xmath28 .",
    "since the @xmath29 are derived from the components of @xmath26 and @xmath27 by algebraic operations , they can be called ` algebraic ' invariants of the tensor @xmath26 .",
    "it can be shown that for this class of spacetimes the following relationships hold between the invariants @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is a consequence of @xmath26 being trace - free ) : @xmath33 ] we adopt the definitions in @xcite for the set , @xmath34 the riemann tensor ) and the square of the ricci tensor ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 the ricci tensor ) . in terms of the set ( [ cm ] ) these are given simply by @xmath37 and @xmath38 . ]",
    "@xmath39 and augment these with @xmath40 in total this set constitutes six real and six complex invariants . the completeness of this set has been examined recently @xcite .",
    "it is certainly complete to degree five ( degree being the total number of weyl , conjugate weyl , and ricci spinors whose contractions make up an invariant ) curvature spinors .",
    "if this is done to degree five , it is found that for _ general _ spacetimes every invariant which is not included in the cm+zm set satisfies an identity allowing it to be written as a rational function of members of the set .",
    "thus , there are no invariants of degree less than or equal to five to be added to the cm+zm set .",
    "@xcite ] . in what follows we _",
    "explicitly _ reduce this set of eighteen invariants to four for the spacetimes under consideration by way of syzygies @xcite .",
    "all syzygies have been developed and tested with the aid of the computer algebra package _ grtensorii _ @xcite .",
    "syzygies follow from a knowledge of which spinor components are non - zero . in the present case",
    "the important features are that these components are real and that the weyl and plebanski tensors ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) share the same principal null directions and are of type @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) . since spacetimes of the form ( 2 ) with ( 3 ) are of petrov type @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) , we have the well - known elementary syzygy$ ] , where @xmath43 refers to the exponent on the weyl spinor , @xmath0 refers to the number of multiplications in the ricci spinor , and @xmath44 refers to the exponent on the conjugate weyl spinor . in this notation , for the types of spacetimes we consider here , only two parameters are necessary , @xmath45 $ ] . given a rule of composition : for invariants @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 $ ]",

    "equivalent syzygies have been given by zakhary and mcintosh for their set of invariants @xcite .",
    "we observe the following additional syzygies @xcite @xmath68 and @xmath69 further , we observe that @xcite ) we note that @xmath70 and that @xmath71 or @xmath72 . ]",
    "@xmath73 @xmath74 and that @xmath75    the syzygy ( [ r3 ] ) is the counterpart for the plebanski tensor to the syzygy ( [ elm ] ) for the weyl tensor .",
    "we expect that the syzygies ( [ elm ] ) through ( [ r3 ] ) will hold in a wider class of spacetimes than type @xmath0 warped products .",
    "the syzygies ( [ m2 ] ) through ( [ r3 ] ) remove the independence of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath54 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 respectively . according to the syzygy ( [ elm ] )",
    "the sign of @xmath80 ( which changes with signature ) can not be obtained from @xmath81 whereas @xmath82 .",
    "this suggests that for metrics of the form ( 2 ) with ( 3 ) we take the set @xmath83 as the independent set of scalar polynomial invariants , satisfying the number of degrees of freedom in the curvature .",
    "we note , however , that these do not necessarily constitute a _",
    "complete _ set in the sense of classical invariant theory , where the set is considered complete only if every invariant not contained in the set can be written as an integral rational function of the other members of the set @xcite .",
    "this is clearly not the case here , for @xmath84 can not be written as an integral rational function of @xmath85 , nor vise versa , whereas @xmath79 is determined as the root of a cubic from ( [ r3 ] ) .    from a practical standpoint , however , we are more concerned with isolating the functional degrees of freedom in the curvature , since by considering a more general interdependence ( ie . by allowing non - integer exponents in our polynomials )",
    "we can in principle solve for any other of the remaining invariants in terms of the given set . by inspection of the invariants listed in ( [ min ] ) , it is clear that they are functionally independent and that they make up the required number of degrees of freedom ( _ i.e. _ 4 ) for the class of spacetimes in question , and in this sense we can consider them to be a ` complete ' list .",
    "the invariants are reproduced in appendix b.",
    "the syzygies are certainly of value for computational efficiency . however , understanding the physical benefit of the syzygies is somewhat more difficult .",
    "mixed invariants have been used to provide a number of alignment theorems for the perfect fluid and maxwell cases @xcite and to classify the riemann spinor @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to provide some physical consequences of the syzygies presented by way of expressing them in terms of the electric and magnetic components of the weyl tensor , and to show how the syzygy ( [ r3 ] ) can be used to impose restrictions on physical quantities in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it is convenient to revert to classical notation .",
    "first we consider the weyl tensor ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the  electric \" and  magnetic \" parts are defined , as usual , by @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a unit timelike vector and @xmath90 the dual tensor . writing @xmath91 and @xmath92 directly from the expression @xmath93[d}u_{c ] } + g_{a[c}q_{d]b } - g_{b[c}q_{d]a } + i   \\eta_{abef } u^e u_{[c}{q_{d]}}^f + i \\eta_{cdef } u^e u_{[a }   { q_{b]}}^f\\ ] ] for @xmath94 ( e.g. , @xcite ) it follows that @xmath95 and that @xmath96 equivalently , it follows that @xmath55 ( @xmath97 ) is given by    @xmath98    and that @xmath56 ( @xmath99 ) is given by @xmath100    relations ( [ bonnor2 ] ) and ( [ mci2 ] ) hold _ in general _ and are _ independent _ of the timelike vector chosen to split the weyl tensor into its electric and magnetic parts .",
    "these expressions can , for example , be used to clarify the relationship between the criterion of bel and those of misra and singh .",
    "the bel condition @xcite is that @xmath55 = @xmath56 = 0 if and only if the spacetime is of petrov type n or iii ( or , of course o ) .",
    "the condition of misra and singh @xcite can be stated as @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "expressions ( [ bonnor2 ] ) and ( [ mci2 ] ) show that these conditions are _ inequivalent _ , contrary to the claim by zakharov @xcite .",
    "independence from the timelike vector chosen to split the weyl tensor does not , of course , extend into the mixed invariants .",
    "for example , it follows that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath103 are given by @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively , where @xmath26 is the trace - free ricci tensor .",
    "expressions for the next degree of mixed invariants ( @xmath66 in the notation of @xcite ) have been evaluated but the results are rather unwieldy ( they contain 16 independent terms ) .",
    "the important point is that with the appearance of the vector @xmath106 and scalar @xmath107 it becomes necessary to introduce an explicit form of @xmath26 in order to proceed .",
    "this avenue is explored briefly below .",
    "relations equivalent to ( [ bonnor1 ] ) ( or ( [ bonnor2 ] ) ) have been reexamined recently by bonnor @xcite .",

    "specializing now to real @xmath108 we observe that @xmath109 and that @xmath110 moreover , from ( 9 ) we obtain the further relation @xmath111 it is perhaps worth emphasizing the fact that relations ( [ eh ] ) , ( [ hhh ] ) , and ( [ ehh ] ) hold for all petrov type @xmath41 spacetimes with real @xmath108 .",
    "this includes a much wider class than class @xmath0 warped product spaces .",
    "we now wish to explore any restrictions that the syzygy ( [ r3 ] ) might impose on physical quantities in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "first , however , recall that at most three ricci invariants are independent . finding syzygies associated with ricci invariants of higher degree , @xmath112 , and @xmath79 .",

    "ricci syzygies up to @xmath119 are given in appendix c.    to begin , consider a perfect fluid , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the energy density , @xmath122 is the ( isotropic ) pressure , and @xmath123 is the normalized timelike flow vector .",
    "the ricci invariants in this case all reduce to the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a constant .",
    "the syzygy ( [ r3 ] ) reduces to the identity @xmath126 . increasing the complexity of the energy - momentum tensor",
