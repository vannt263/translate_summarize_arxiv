    "the main aim of this article is an attempt to derive a new theory for dark matter and dark energy , and to derive a new set of gravitational field equations .",
    "the primary motivation of this study is the great mystery of the dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the natural starting point for this study is to fundamentally examine the einstein field equations , given as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ricci curvature tensor , @xmath9 is the scalar curvature , @xmath1 is the riemannian metric of the space - time , and @xmath5 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter ; see among many others @xcite .",
    "the einstein equations can also be derived using the principle of lagrangian dynamics to the einstein - hilbert functional : @xmath10 whose euler - lagrangian is exactly @xmath11 , which is the left hand side of the einstein field equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "it is postulated that this euler - lagrangian is balanced by the symmetric energy - momentum tensor of matter , @xmath5 , leading to the einstein field equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the bianchi identity implies that the left hand side of the einstein equations is divergence - free , and it is then postulated and widely accepted that the energy - momentum tensor of matter @xmath5 is divergence - free as well .",
    "however , there are a number of difficulties for the einstein field equations :    first , the einstein field equations failed to explain the dark matter and dark energy , and the equations are inconsistent with the accelerating expansion of the galaxies . in spite of many attempts to modify the einstein gravitational field equation to derive a consistent theory for the dark energy ,",
    "the mystery remains .",
    "second , we can prove that there is no solution for the einstein field equations for the spherically symmetric case with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "one needs clearly to resolve this inconsistency caused by the non - existence of solutions .",
    "third , from the einstein equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) , it is clear that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy - momentum density .",
    "a direct consequence of this formula is that the discontinuities of @xmath14 give rise to the same discontinuities of the curvature and the discontinuities of space - time .",
    "this is certainly an inconsistency which needs to be resolved .",
    "fourth , it has been observed that the universe is highly non - homogeneous as indicated by e.g. the `` great walls '' , filaments and voids .",
    "however , the einstein equations do not appear to offer a good explanation of this inhomogeneity .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that further fundamental level examinations of the einstein equations are inevitably necessary .",
    "it is clear that any modification of the einstein field equations should obey three basic principles :    * the principle of equivalence , * the principle of general relativity , and * the principle of lagrangian dynamics .",
    "the first two principles tell us that the spatial and temporal world is a 4-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath15 , where the metric @xmath16 represents gravitational potential , and the third principle determines that the riemannian metric @xmath16 is an extremum point of the lagrangian action .",
    "there is no doubt that the most natural lagrangian in this case is the einstein - hilbert functional as explained in many classical texts of general relativity .",
    "the key observation for our study is a well - known fact that the riemannian metric @xmath1 is divergence - free .",
    "this suggests two important postulates for deriving a new set of gravitational field equations :    * the energy - momentum tensor @xmath5 of matter need not to be divergence - free due to the presence of dark energy and dark matter ; and * the field equations obey the euler - lagrange equation of the einstein - hilbert functional under the natural divergence - free constraint , with divergence defined at the extremum riemannian metric @xmath17 : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the contra - variant derivative with respect to the extremum point @xmath17 , and @xmath20 are the variational elements .",
    "namely , for any @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23=(\\delta f(g_{ij } ) , x)=0.\\ ] ]    for this purpose , an important part of this article is to drive an orthogonal decomposition theorem of tensors on riemannian manifolds , which we shall explain further in the last part of this introduction .    under these two postulates , using the orthogonal decomposition theorem of tensors , we derive the following new set of gravitational field equations with scalar potential : @xmath24 where the scalar function @xmath25 is called the scalar potential .",
    "the corresponding conservations of mass , energy and momentum are then replaced by @xmath26 and the energy - momentum density @xmath27 and the scalar potential energy density @xmath28 satisfy @xmath29    the scalar potential energy density @xmath30 has a number of important physical properties :    * gravitation is now described by the riemannian metric @xmath1 , the scalar potential @xmath0 and their interactions , unified by the new gravitational field equations ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "* this scalar potential energy density @xmath30 represents a new type of energy / force caused by the non - uniform distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "this scalar potential energy density varies as the galaxies move and matter of the universe redistributes . like gravity",
    ", it affects every part of the universe as a field . * this scalar potential energy density @xmath30 consists of both positive and negative energies .",
    "the negative part of this potential energy density produces attraction , and the positive part produces repelling force",
    ". the conservation law ( [ 1.6 ] ) amounts to saying that the the total scalar potential energy density is conserved . *",
    "the sum of this new potential energy density @xmath4 and the coupling energy between the energy - momentum tensor @xmath5 and the scalar potential field @xmath0 , as described e.g. by the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ 1.9 - 1 ] ) , gives rise to a new unified theory for dark matter and dark energy : the negative part of @xmath31 represents the dark matter , which produces attraction , and the positive part represents the dark energy , which drives the acceleration of expanding galaxies . * the scalar curvature of space - time obeys ( [ 1.5 ] ) .",
    "consequently , when there is no normal matter present ( with @xmath32 ) , the curvature @xmath9 of space - time is balanced by @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , there is no real vacuum in the universe . *",
    "the universe with uniform distributed matter leads to identically zero scalar potential energy , and is unstable .",
    "it is this instability that leads to the existence of the dark matter and dark energy , and consequently the high non - homogeneity of the universe .",
    "hereafter , we further explore a few direct consequences of the above new gravitational field equations .",
    "first , the new field equations are consistent with the spherically symmetric case with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "namely , the existence of solutions in this case can be proved .",
    "second , our new theory suggests that the curvature @xmath9 is always balanced by @xmath34 in the entire space - time by ( [ 1.5 ] ) , and the space - time is no longer flat .",
    "namely the entire space - time is also curved and is filled with dark energy and dark matter . in particular , the discontinuities of @xmath9 induced by the discontinuities of the energy - momentum density @xmath14 , dictated by the einstein field equations , are no longer present thanks to the balance of @xmath35 .",
    "third , this scalar potential energy density should be viewed as the main cause for the non - homogeneous distribution of the matter / galaxies in the universe , as the dark matter ( negative scalar potential energy ) attracts and dark energy ( positive scalar potential energy ) repels different galaxies ; see ( [ 1.9 - 1 ] ) below .",
    "fourth , to further explain the dark matter and dark energy phenomena , we consider a central matter field with total mass @xmath36 and radius @xmath37 and spherical symmetry .",
    "with spherical coordinates , the corresponding riemannian metric must be of the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are functions of the radial distance . with the new field equations , the force exerted on an object with mass @xmath41",
    "is given by @xmath42 ,   \\qquad r = \\phi \\qquad \\text { for } r > r_0.\\la{1.9 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath9 is the scalar curvature , and @xmath0 is the scalar potential . the first term is the classical newton gravitation , the second term is the coupling interaction between matter and the scalar potential @xmath0 , and the third term is the interaction generated by the scalar potential energy density @xmath30 as indicated in ( [ 1.5 ] ) ( @xmath33 for @xmath44 ) . in this formula ,",
    "the negative and positive values of each term represent respectively the attracting and repelling forces .",
    "it is then clear that the combined effect of the second and third terms in the above formula represent the dark matter , dark energy and their interactions with normal matter .    also , importantly",
    ", this formula is a direct representation of the einstein s equivalence principle .",
    "namely , the curvature of space - time induces interaction forces between matter .",
    "in addition , one can derive a more detailed version of the above formula : @xmath45,\\la{f0}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "the conservation law ( [ 1.6 ] ) of @xmath34 suggests that @xmath9 behaviors as @xmath47 for @xmath48 sufficiently large .",
    "consequently the second term in the right hand side of ( [ f0 ] ) must dominate and be positive , indicating the existence of dark energy .",
    "in fact , the above formula can be further simplified to derive the following approximate formula : @xmath49 , \\la{1.9}\\\\ & k_0=4   \\times 10^{-18 } km^{-1 } , \\qquad k_1=10^{-57 } km^{-3}.\\la{1.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , in ( [ 1.9 ] ) , the first term represents the newton gravitation , the attracting second term stands for dark matter and the repelling third term is the dark energy .",
    "the mathematical part of this article is devoted to a rigorous derivation of the new gravitational field equations .",
    "first , as mentioned earlier , the field equations obey the euler - lagrange equation of the einstein - hilbert functional under the natural divergence - free constraint , with divergence defined at the extremum riemannian metric @xmath17 : @xmath50 as the variational elements @xmath51 are divergence - free , ( [ el ] ) does not imply @xmath52 , which is the classical einstein equations .",
    "in fact , ( [ el ] ) amounts to saying that @xmath53 is orthogonal to all divergence - free tensor fields @xmath51 .",
    "hence we need to decompose general tensor fields on riemannian manifolds into divergence - free and gradient parts . for this purpose ,",
    "an orthogonal decomposition theorem is derived in theorem  [ t3.1 ] . in particular , given an @xmath54 tensor field @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 the gradient part is acting on an @xmath57 tensor field @xmath58 .",
    "second , restricting to a @xmath59 symmetric tensor field @xmath60 , the gradient part in the above decomposition is given by @xmath61 then using symmetry , we show in theorem  [ t3.4 ] that this @xmath62 tensor @xmath58 can be uniquely determined , up to addition to constants , by the gradient of a scalar field @xmath0",
    ": @xmath63 and consequently we obtain the following decomposition for general symmetric @xmath59 tensor fields : @xmath64    finally , for the symmetric and divergence free @xmath59 field @xmath53 , which is the euler - lagrangian of the einstein - hilbert functional in ( [ el ] ) and is orthogonal to all divergence - free fields , there is a scalar field @xmath65 such that @xmath66 which , by adding the energy - momentum tensor @xmath5 , leads to the new gravitational field equations ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "we remark here that the orthogonal decompositions ( [ rsd ] ) and ( [ 02d ] ) are reminiscent of the orthogonal decomposition of vectors fields into gradient and divergence parts , which are crucial for studying incompressible fluid flows ; see among many others @xcite .",
    "this article is divided into two parts .",
    "the physically inclined readers can go directly to the physics part after reading this introduction .",
    "let @xmath15 be an @xmath67-dimensional riemannian manifold with metric @xmath68 , and @xmath69 be an @xmath70-tensor bundle on @xmath36 .",
    "a mapping @xmath71 is called a section of the tensor - bundle @xmath72 or a tensor field . in a local coordinate system @xmath73 , a tensor field @xmath60",
    "can be expressed component - wise as follows : @xmath74 where @xmath75 are functions of @xmath76 . the section @xmath60 is called @xmath77-tensor field or @xmath77-section if its components are @xmath77-functions .    for any real number @xmath78 ,",
    "let @xmath79 be the space of all @xmath80-integrable sections of @xmath72 : @xmath81 equipped with the norm @xmath82^{{1}/{p}}=\\left[\\int_m\\sum|u^{j_1\\cdots j_r}_{i_1\\cdots i_s}|^pdx\\right]^{1/p}.\\ ] ] for @xmath83 , @xmath84 is a hilbert space equipped with the inner product @xmath85 where @xmath68 is riemannian metric , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the volume element .    for any positive integer @xmath89 and any real number @xmath90 , we can also define the sobolev spaces @xmath91 to be the subspace of @xmath79 such that all covariant derivatives of u up to order @xmath89 are in @xmath79 .",
    "the norm of @xmath91 is always denoted by @xmath92 .    as @xmath83 ,",
    "the spaces @xmath91 are hilbert spaces , and are usually denoted by @xmath93 equipped with inner product @xmath94 and norm @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96 be an @xmath70-tensor field , with the local expression @xmath97 then the gradient of @xmath60 is defined as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the covariant derivative .",
    "it is clear that the gradient @xmath100 defined by ( [ ( 2.6 ) ] ) is an @xmath101-tensor field : @xmath102 we define @xmath103 as @xmath104    for an @xmath105-tensor field @xmath106 the divergence of @xmath60 is defined by @xmath107 therefore , the divergence @xmath108 defined by ( [ ( 2.8 ) ] ) is an @xmath70-tensor field .",

    "let @xmath15 be a closed riemannian manifold .",
    "if @xmath60 is an @xmath112-tensor and @xmath113 is an @xmath70 tensor , then we have @xmath114 where @xmath103 is as in ( [ ( 2.7 ) ] ) and @xmath115 is as in ( [ ( 2.8 ) ] ) , the inner product @xmath116 is as defined by ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) . if @xmath60 is an @xmath117-tensor and @xmath113 is an @xmath70 tensor , then @xmath118 where @xmath100 is as in ( [ ( 2.6 ) ] ) and @xmath119 is as in ( [ ( 2.9 ) ] ) .",

    "the aim of this section is to derive an orthogonal decomposition for @xmath70-tensor fields with @xmath134 into divergence - free and gradient parts .",
    "this decomposition plays a crucial role for the theory of gravitational field , dark matter and dark energy developed later in this article .",
    "let @xmath36 be a closed riemannian manifold , and @xmath135 @xmath136 .",
    "we say that @xmath113 is divergence - free , i.e. , @xmath137 , if for all @xmath138 , @xmath139 here @xmath140 or @xmath141 , and @xmath116 is the @xmath142-inner product defined by ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) .",
    "we remark that if @xmath143 satisfies ( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) , then @xmath113 is weakly differentiable , and @xmath144 in the @xmath142-sense . if @xmath145 is not differential , then ( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) means that @xmath113 is divergence - free in the distribution sense .",
    "let @xmath36 be a closed riemannian manifold , and @xmath146 with @xmath147 .",
    "the following assertions hold true :    * the tensor field @xmath60 has the following orthogonal decomposition : @xmath148 where @xmath149 or @xmath150 , and @xmath151 . *",
    "if @xmath36 is compact , then @xmath60 can be orthogonally decomposed into @xmath152 where @xmath0 and @xmath113 are as in ( [ ( 3.2 ) ] ) , and @xmath153 is a harmonic field , i.e. @xmath154 in particular the subspace of all harmonic tensor fields in @xmath155 is of finite dimensional : @xmath156    we proceed in several steps as follows .",
    "step 1 proof of assertion ( 1 ) .",
    "let @xmath157 , @xmath69 @xmath136 .",
    "consider the equation @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the laplace operator defined by @xmath160    without loss of generality , we only consider the case where @xmath161 .",
    "it is clear that if the equation ( [ ( 3.6 ) ] ) has a solution @xmath162 , then by ( [ ( 3.7 ) ] ) , the following vector field must be divergence - free @xmath163 moreover , by ( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) we have @xmath164 namely @xmath113 and @xmath165 are orthogonal .",
    "therefore , the orthogonal decomposition @xmath166 follows from ( [ ( 3.8 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 3.9 ) ] ) .",
    "it suffices then to prove that ( [ ( 3.6 ) ] ) has a weak solution @xmath162 : @xmath167 to this end , let @xmath168 then we define a linear operator @xmath169 by @xmath170 it is clear that the linear operator @xmath171 is bounded , weakly continuous , and @xmath172 based on theorem [ t2.3 ] , for any @xmath131 , the equation @xmath173 has a weak solution @xmath174 .",
    "hence for @xmath175 the equation ( [ ( 3.6 ) ] ) has a solution , and assertion ( 1 ) is proved .",
    "in fact the solution of ( [ ( 3.6 ) ] ) is unique .",
    "we remark that by the poincar inequality , for the space @xmath176 , ( [ ( 3.12 ) ] ) is an equivalent norm of @xmath120 .",
    "in addition , by theorem [ t2.1 ] , the weak formulation ( [ ( 3.10 ) ] ) for ( [ ( 3.6 ) ] ) is well - defined .",
    "step 2 proof of assertion ( 2 ) . based on assertion ( 1 )",
    ", we have @xmath177 where @xmath178 define an operator @xmath179 by @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the canonical orthogonal projection .    we know that the laplace operator @xmath159 can be expressed as @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the lower order derivative linear operator . since @xmath36 is compact ,",
    "the sobolev embeddings @xmath184 are compact , which implies that the lower order derivative operator @xmath185 where the integer @xmath186 is the dimension of the tensor bundle @xmath72 . according to the elliptic operator theory , the elliptic operator in ( [ ( 3.14 ) ] )",
    "@xmath187 is a linear homeomorphism .",
    "therefore the operator in ( [ ( 3.14 ) ] ) is a linear completely continuous field @xmath188 which implies that the operator of ( [ ( 3.13 ) ] ) is also a linear completely continuous field : @xmath189    by the the spectral theorem of completely continuous fields @xcite , the space @xmath190 is finite dimensional , and is the eigenspace of the eigenvalue @xmath191 . by theorem [ t2.1 ] , for @xmath192 @xmath193 it follows that @xmath194 where @xmath120 is the harmonic space as in ( [ ( 3.5 ) ] ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath195 the proof of theorem [ t3.1 ] is complete .      in theorem [ t3.1 ] ,",
    "a tensor field @xmath146 with @xmath134 can be orthogonally decomposed into @xmath196    now we address the uniqueness problem of the decomposition ( [ ( 3.15 ) ] ) .",
    "in fact , if @xmath60 is a vector field or a co - vector field , i.e. @xmath197 then the decomposition of ( [ ( 3.15 ) ] ) is unique .",
    "we can see that if @xmath146 with @xmath198 , then there are different types of the decompositions of ( [ ( 3.15 ) ] ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath199 , the local expression of @xmath60 is given by @xmath200 in this case , @xmath60 has two types of decompositions : @xmath201 it is easy to see that if @xmath202 then both ( [ ( 3.16 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 3.17 ) ] ) are two different decompositions of @xmath203 .",
    "namely @xmath204",
    "if @xmath205 is symmetric , @xmath60 can be orthogonally decomposed into the following two forms : @xmath206 and @xmath0 and @xmath58 satisfy @xmath207 by @xmath205 we have @xmath208 .",
    "hence , ( [ ( 3.18 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 3.19 ) ] ) are the same , and @xmath209 .",
    "therefore , the symmetric tensors @xmath203 can be written as @xmath210 from ( [ ( 3.20)])-([(3.21 ) ] ) we can deduce the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath199 be symmetric , i.e. @xmath205 , and the first betti number @xmath211 for @xmath36 .",
    "then the following assertions hold true :    * @xmath60 has a unique orthogonal decomposition if and only if there is a scalar function @xmath212 such that @xmath60 can be expressed as @xmath213 * @xmath60 can be orthogonally decomposed in the form of ( [ ( 3.22 ) ] ) if and only if @xmath203 satisfy @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath8 are the ricci curvature tensors . *",
    "if @xmath216 in ( [ ( 3.20 ) ] ) is symmetric : @xmath217 , then @xmath60 can be expressed by ( [ ( 3.22 ) ] ) .",
    "we only need to prove assertions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .    we first prove assertion ( 2 ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ ( 3.20 ) ] ) that @xmath218 where @xmath219 . by the weitzenbck formula @xcite , @xmath220 and @xmath221",
    "is the laplace - beltrami operator . we know that for @xmath222 , @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the gradient operator , and @xmath225 namely @xmath226 hence , we infer from ( [ ( 3.25 ) ] ) that @xmath227 thus , by ( [ ( 3.24 ) ] ) and ( [ ( 3.26 ) ] ) , we obtain that @xmath228 holds true if and only if the tensor @xmath229 in ( [ ( 3.20 ) ] ) is a gradient @xmath230 .",
    "assertion ( 2 ) is proven .",
    "now we verify assertion ( 3 ) .",
    "since @xmath216 in ( [ ( 3.20 ) ] ) is symmetric , we have @xmath231 note that @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the levi - civita connection , and @xmath234 .",
    "we infer then from ( [ ( 3.27 ) ] ) that @xmath235 by assumption , the 1-dimensional homology of @xmath36 is zero , @xmath236 and it follows from the de rham theorem and ( [ ( 3.29 ) ] ) that @xmath237 for some scalar function @xmath0 .",
    "thus assertion ( 3 ) follows and the proof is complete .",
    "hereafter we always assume that @xmath36 is a closed manifold .",
