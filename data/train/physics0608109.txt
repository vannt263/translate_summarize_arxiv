    "in recent years , there has been a considerable interest in many physical phenomena associated with the existence of coherence between atomic states .",
    "such coherences , induced and detected by light , form the basis of certain nonlinear optical effects and are essential in such applications as magnetometry @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , and quantum gates @xcite .",
    "they are also extensively employed in tests of fundamental symmetries ( see , for example , reviews @xcite ) and in frequency standards @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of atomic coherences involving excited atomic states is generally limited to twice the time required for spontaneous emission of a photon and transition to a lower state . on the other hand , for coherences between atomic ground states the effective coherence lifetime @xmath0",
    "is either determined by the interaction time between the light and atoms , or by the time between coherence - destroying collisions . in many applications , the longer the lifetime of the coherences , the better resolution , contrast or sensitivity that can be achieved .    in a typical experiment , involving a single light beam and a glass cell containing only alkali - metal vapor at low pressure , the effective coherence lifetime is given by the transit time of the atoms through the light beam . in order to suppress coherences - destroying collisions of atoms with cell walls and increase the lifetime @xmath0 , one of two methods is employed .",
    "the first method is to add to the cell a buffer ( usually noble ) gas at relatively high pressure . since in the first approximation",
    "the collisions with the buffer gas are elastic , @xmath0 is then given by the time for the alkali atoms to diffuse from the light beam .",
    "the second method is to apply an anti - relaxation coating to the inner walls of the cell , preventing spin - depolarizing collisions of the atoms with the walls .",
    "this allows atoms to leave the light beam and later return to it with the coherences intact . using these methods",
    "the coherence lifetimes have been prolonged to hundreds of milliseconds ( see , for example refs . @xcite and references therein ) . as wall relaxation",
    "is decreased , however , other sources of relaxation become important , such as spin - exchange self - collisions and magnetic - field gradients , of which the latter is discussed here .",
    "the sensitivity of the rate of relaxation @xmath1 of the ground - state coherences ( @xmath2 ) to magnetic - field inhomogeneities was previously studied under different experimental conditions @xcite . in a series of papers @xcite the sensitivity of the relaxation rate to the magnetic - field gradients",
    "was studied in anti - relaxation - coated cells .",
    "theoretical predictions supported by numerical simulations were compared with data obtained in a high - resolution zeeman spectroscopy experiment performed with relatively strong bias magnetic field @xmath3 g. in such range of magnetic fields , the nonlinear zeeman effect significantly contributes to relaxation and it can not be neglected . in refs.@xcite the sensitivity of the relaxation rate @xmath1 to the magnetic - field gradients in a buffer - gas cell was studied both theoretically and experimentally .    in this work the rate of relaxation due to magnetic - field inhomogeneity is studied in buffer - gas - free anti - relaxation - coated cells at relatively low magnetic fields ( @xmath4 mg ) , where the influence of the nonlinear zeeman effect on relaxation is negligible . a naive theoretical model of the sensitivity of the relaxation rate to the magnetic - field inhomogeneity is given . a relation between the sensitivity of the relaxation rate and cell size or atomic spice contained in the cell",
    "is derived .",
    "experimentally , the problem is studied using nonlinear magneto - optical rotation with frequency - modulated light ( fm nmor ) @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the fm nmor resonances to first - order magnetic - field gradients is analyzed and compared with the model predictions .",
    "the sensitivity to the magnetic - field gradients is studied for different bias magnetic fields .",
    "this enables observation of two different regimes , one in which the rate of relaxation @xmath1 depends equally on the magnetic - field inhomogeneities in each direction and the other , in which it is completely insensitive to the transverse inhomogeneities .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] the theoretical model of the sensitivity of the rate of relaxation to the magnetic - field inhomogeneities is given .",
    "the experimental apparatus and the measurement technique are described in section [ sec : setup ] . in section [ sec : results ] the experimental results are presented and compared with the predictions of the model .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider atoms contained in a buffer - gas - free , anti - relaxation - coated spherical cell of radius @xmath5 .",
    "since at room temperature at saturated alkali - vapor densities an atom s mean free path is on the order of hundreds of meters , the atoms travel freely between collisions with the cell walls . to analyze the influence of magnetic - field inhomogeneities on the rate of relaxation of the ground - state coherences , we use a simple model for a first - order magnetic - field gradient , for example , @xmath6 , in which the gradient field in each half of the cell is replaced by a constant magnetic field @xmath7 in that half . in other words ,",
    "the cell is considered to have the magnetic field @xmath8 for @xmath9 and the opposite field @xmath10 for @xmath11 . at this point",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is the only magnetic field inside the cell .",
    "however , the effect of homogenous bias magnetic field @xmath12 is considered below .    between wall collisions , the atomic spins precess due to the magnetic field and acquire an average phase @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the land factor , @xmath15 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath16 is the average time between two collisions and @xmath17 is the r.m.s .",
    "atomic thermal velocity .",
    "however , since acquiring the phase is a random process the actual phases acquired by the atom vary between collisions .",
    "another source of random phase is inelastic wall collisions .",
    "a simple model of wall - collision relaxation is the following . during a collision with the wall",
    ", an atom is stuck to the surface for approximately @xmath18 s @xcite ( note that the duration of an elastic collision is @xmath1910@xmath20 s ) , and is then released in a random direction with a random velocity . during the time it spends on the surface the atom feels an excess magnetic field @xmath21 .",
    "this field causes the atomic spin to rotate , producing an average phase shift @xmath22 . combining the phases due to the magnetic - field inhomogeneity and wall collisions for @xmath23 successive bounces in quadrature , the total phase is @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{eq : phasesinglepass}\\ ] ]    a characteristic relaxation time corresponds to a decrease of initial spin polarization by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "one can show that this happens when @xmath26 , and thus the total number of wall collisions before dephasing @xmath27 is @xmath28 the relaxation rate @xmath1 of the atoms can be written as @xmath29 in the two limiting cases in which only one mechanism of relaxation is present , eq .",
    "( [ eq : relaxationconstantbase ] ) takes the forms @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the numbers of bounces before relaxation when only the gradient relaxation or the wall relaxation is present .",
    "it is noteworthy that including other relaxation mechanisms such as spin - exchange collisions does not change the present treatment .    combining eqs .  , ( [ eq : totalphase ] ) , ( [ eq : relaxationconstantbase ] ) , ( [ eq : relaxationconstantgradient ] ) , and ( [ eq : relaxationconstantwall ] ) we find @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "one sees that the rate of relaxation due to magnetic - field gradients depends quadratically on the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field @xmath35 , scales as @xmath36 , and depends on the atomic species through the @xmath37 dependence .",
    "now , we consider the effect of the homogenous bias magnetic field @xmath12 , leading to a larmor precession frequency @xmath38 . in this situation",
    "we consider two regimes : ( 1 ) @xmath39 , in which atomic spins rotate by only a small angle between collisions with the cell walls and ( 2 ) @xmath40 , in which the spins rotate by a large angle between successive wall bounces . in the first regime , since small rotations commute , i.e. , the result of the composite rotation does not depend on the order of rotations , the spins precession around orthogonal components of the magnetic field can be , to a good approximation , considered as independent .",
    "thus , comparable sensitivity to longitudinal and transverse magnetic - field gradients can be expected . in the second regime",
    "the larmor precession is rapid and the strong bias magnetic field breaks the symmetry of the system . since fields transverse to the strong bias fields are only second order corrections to the total magnetic field , the sensitivities of atomic - polarization relaxation rates to longitudinal and transverse magnetic - field gradients are different .    in the limit of high bias field , one would expect the relaxation rate to become completely insensitive to transverse gradients .",
    "however , according to maxwell s equations generation of a magnetic - field gradient in one direction requires gradients in other directions ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "thus , in conditions of our experiment , when a gradient transverse to the light propagation direction is applied ( say @xmath42 ) , a gradient @xmath43 given by @xmath44 also appears along the longitudinal direction @xmath45 .",
    "since the relaxation is quadratic in the magnetic - field gradient , it is expected that the relaxation rate should be four times as sensitive to gradients nominally along the longitudinal direction as they are to those nominally in a transverse direction .",
    "relaxation rates may be studied by observing the widths of resonances in optical rotation using the fm nmor technique @xcite .",
    "the layout of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .     and compensation of the residual fields in other directions , as well as gradient coils , are not shown . ]",
    "rubidium atoms are contained in anti - relaxation - coated buffer - gas - free spherical vapor cells of different diameters and containing different isotopic compositions of rubidium ( table [ tab : cells ] ) .",
    ".[tab : cells]anti - relaxation - coated , buffer - gas - free vapor cells used in the present work . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sensitivity ]    the sensitivity to the magnetic - field gradients varies with the orientation of the coils used for generation of the gradients , cell size and rubidium isotope .",
    "as seen in table [ tab : sensitivity ] , the sensitivity to the gradients in larger cells is stronger than in the smaller cell . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : relaxationconstantdeltab ] ) , the sensitivity to the magnetic - field gradients scales as @xmath36 .",
    "in order to check this , table [ tab : sensitivityratios ] gives the experimentally measured ratios for cells of different sizes along with the theoretical predictions . to calculate the theoretical ratio between sensitivity due to different sizes of the cells their inner radii were used .",
    "they were estimated by subtraction of a wall thickness , which were assumed to be @xmath46 cm , from the cells outer radii .",
    "c|c|c|c|c cells & @xmath45 axis & @xmath47 axis & @xmath48 axis & theory +   + rb10/h2 & 40(8 ) & 43(8 ) & 33(4 ) & 35(8 ) + gibb / h2 & 38(8 ) & 36(6 ) & 30(5 ) & 36(10 ) + rb10/gibb & 0.94(3 ) & 0.85(5 ) & 0.90(4 ) & 0.94(12 ) +   + ale10/gibb & 0.39(2 ) & 0.34(4 ) & 0.38(3 ) & * 0.44 + ale10/rb10 & 0.41(2 ) & 0.39(4 ) & 0.41(3 ) +    the experimental data are consistent with the predictions of the model .",
    "according to the model , the fm nmor width scales with land factor as @xmath37 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : relaxationconstantdeltab ] ) ] .",
    "for the two isotopes of rubidium , @xmath49rb and @xmath50rb , for which the land factors are 1/3 and 1/2 , respectively , the expected ratio is 4/9 .",
    "rough agreement is seen between the experimental results and predictions for the ratios of sensitivities for cells containing different isotopes [ table [ tab : sensitivityratios ] ] .",
    "the results in table [ tab : sensitivityratios ] are scaled to take into account the different cell sizes . for the results relating the ale10 and gibb cells , we associate a difference from the theoretical value with the slightly nonspherical shape of the gibb cell ( in addition to the overall non - sphericity",
    ", it does not have a typical stem but it has a number of tubulations ) .",
    "another source of deviation is the different bias field used for the measurements with the ale10 cell , as noted in the caption to table [ tab : sensitivity ] .",
    "as discussed above , this difference affects the sensitivities to the transverse magnetic - field gradients .",
    "we have presented a simple model describing a relation between the relaxation rate of the ground - state coherences @xmath1 of atoms contained in buffer - gas - free anti - relaxation - coated cell and magnetic - field inhomogeneities .",
    "the results of the experiments using nonlinear magneto - optical rotation with frequency - modulated light have confirmed the model across the board .",
    "we showed that the rate of relaxation @xmath1 of the ground - state zeeman coherences is proportional to the square of the magnetic - field inhomogeneity ( first - order magnetic - field gradients ) , and that it scales as the cube of the cell size and as the square of the land factor .",
    "additionally , we provide experimental evidence that the sensitivity to the longitudinal part of the magnetic - field inhomogeneity is independent of bias magnetic field , but the sensitivity to the transverse part of the inhomogeneity changes with bias field . at",
    "small bias fields the sensitivity to transverse inhomogeneities is similar to the sensitivity in the longitudinal direction , but at larger fields ( where the zeeman frequency exceeds the wall - collision rate ) , it vanishes .",
