    "the discrepancy of about @xmath9 between the measured value  @xcite and standard model prediction  @xcite for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath10 , has attracted considerable attention . after the purely qed contributions , which are now known to five loops  @xcite , the next most important term in the standard model prediction is the leading order ( lo ) hadronic vacuum polarization ( hvp ) contribution , @xmath11 .",
    "the error on the dispersive evaluation of this quantity , obtained from the errors on the input @xmath12 cross - sections , is currently the largest of the contributions to the error on the standard model prediction  @xcite .",
    "the dispersive approach is , moreover , complicated by discrepancies between the determinations by different experiments of the cross - sections for the most important exclusive channel , @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the existence of this discrepancy , and the role played by the error on the lo hvp contribution , have led to an increased interest in providing an independent determination of @xmath11 from the lattice @xcite .",
    "such a determination is made possible by the representation of @xmath11 as a weighted integral of the subtracted polarization , @xmath14 , over euclidean momentum - squared @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , @xmath15 where , with @xmath16 the muon mass , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the unsubtracted polarization , defined from the hadronic electromagnetic current - current two - point function , @xmath20 , via @xmath21 the vacuum polarization @xmath20 can be computed , and hence @xmath19 determined for non - zero @xmath22 , for those quantized euclidean @xmath22 accessible on a given finite - volume lattice .",
    "were @xmath19 to be determined on a sufficiently finely spaced @xmath8 grid , especially in the region of the peak of the integrand , @xmath11 could be determined from lattice data by direct numerical integration .",
    "two facts complicate such a determination .",
    "first , since the kinematic tensor on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ polndefn ] ) , and hence the entire two - point function signal , vanishes as @xmath23 , the errors on the direct determination of @xmath19 become very large in the crucial low-@xmath8 region .",
    "second , for the lattice volumes employed in current simulations , only a limited number of points is available in the low-@xmath8 region , at least for conventional simulations with periodic boundary conditions . with the peak of the integrand centered around @xmath24  gev@xmath7 , one would need lattices with a linear size of about 20  fm to obtain lattice data near the peak .",
    "the rather coarse coverage and sizable errors at very low @xmath8 make it necessary to fit the lattice data for @xmath19 to some functional form , at least in the low-@xmath8 region .",
    "existing lattice determinations have typically attempted to fit the form of @xmath19 over a sizable range of @xmath8 , a strategy partly predicated on the fact that the errors on the lattice determination are much smaller at larger @xmath8 , and hence more capable of constraining the parameters of a given fit form .",
    "the necessity of effectively extrapolating high-@xmath8 , high - acccuracy data to the low-@xmath8 region most relevant to @xmath11 creates a potential systematic error difficult to quantify using lattice data alone .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , this issue was investigated using a physical model for the subtracted @xmath4 polarization , @xmath25 .",
    "the model was constructed using the dispersive representation of @xmath25 , with experimental hadronic @xmath26 decay data used to fix the relevant input spectral function .",
    "the study showed that ( 1 ) @xmath27 has a significantly stronger curvature at low @xmath8 than at high @xmath8 and ( 2 ) , as a result , the extrapolation to low @xmath8 produced by typical lattice fits , being more strongly controlled by the numerous small - error large-@xmath8 data points , is systematically biased towards producing insufficient curvature in the low-@xmath8 region either not covered by the data , or covered only by data with much larger errors . resolving this problem requires an improved focus on contributions from the low-@xmath8 region and a reduction in the impact of the large-@xmath8 region on the low-@xmath8 behavior of the fit functions and/or procedures employed .    in this paper",
    "we propose a hybrid strategy to accomplish these goals .",
    "the features of this strategy are predicated on a study of the @xmath4 contribution to @xmath11 corresponding to the model for the @xmath4 polarization function , @xmath25 , introduced in ref .",
    "the results of this study lead us to advocate a combination of direct numerical integration of the lattice data in the region above @xmath28  gev@xmath7 , and the use of pad or other representations in the low-@xmath8 ( @xmath29 ) region .",
    "we will consider two non - pad alternatives for representing @xmath30 at low @xmath8 , that provided by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and that provided by a polynomial expansion in a conformal transformation of the variable @xmath8 improving the convergence properties of the expansion .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly review the construction of the model , and use the resulting @xmath25 to quantify expectations about both the behavior of the integrand for @xmath31^{i=1}$ ] and the accumulation of contributions to this quantity as a function of the upper limit of integration in the analogue of eq .",
    "( [ amu ] ) .",
    "we also show , with fake data generated from the model using the covariances and @xmath8 values of a typical lattice simulation with periodic boundary conditions , that the contribution to @xmath32 from @xmath8 above @xmath3 can be evaluated with an error well below @xmath5 of the full contribution by direct trapezoid - rule numerical integration for @xmath3 down to at least as low as @xmath33  gev@xmath7 .",

    "the three functional forms we investigate are low - order pad s , a polynomial representation in a conformally mapped variable , and a next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) chpt form supplemented by an analytic nnnlo term . the pad s we will consider are of two types : those constrained explicitly to reproduce the first few derivatives at @xmath37 @xcite , and those obtained by fitting to data in the low-@xmath8 region @xcite . we will be limited to investigating the systematics of these low-@xmath8 representations . the lattice @xmath8 values and covariance matrix employed for fake - data studies in ref .",

    "we expect , however , that new lattice data , employing twisted boundary conditions to provide a denser set of @xmath8 values on the lattice @xcite , as well as improved statistics @xcite , will make a more complete investigation possible in the near future . in this section",
    "we also discuss briefly the expected low-@xmath8 behavior of the subtracted isoscalar polarization , @xmath38 , which can be obtained using values for the relevant chiral lecs obtained from a chiral fit to the isovector model data . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we discuss the relation between the errors on the low-@xmath8 contribution to @xmath32 and those on the slope and curvature at @xmath37 , and argue that a sub - percent determination of the former and few percent determination of the latter should be sufficient to obtain a sub - percent determination of the full contribution to @xmath11 .",
    "this section also contains our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath4 vector polarization function , @xmath39 , satisfies a once - subtracted dispersion relation , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the pion mass , and @xmath42 the corresponding spectral function . a sensible choice for @xmath43 and the function @xmath42 thus determines a model for @xmath39 .",

    "the subtracted polarization represents one such version , in which @xmath43 happens to be equal to @xmath44 .",
    "the spectral function @xmath42 has been measured with high precision , for @xmath45 , in non - strange hadronic @xmath26 decays  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath25 was determined from eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) using as input a version of the opal data updated for modern values of the exclusive mode branching fractions . for those @xmath46 not accessible in @xmath26 decay ,",
    "@xmath42 was represented by the 5-loop - truncated dimension @xmath47 perturbative form @xcite , supplemented by a model representation of the residual , duality violating ( dv ) contribution .",
    "an exponentially damped oscillatory form motivated by large-@xmath48 and regge ideas , was used for the latter , based on a model for duality violations developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , inspired by earlier work in refs .  @xcite .",
    "where the perturbative+dv form is used for @xmath42 above @xmath49 , the dv contribution is much smaller than the perturbative one , making the model dependence of the resulting version of @xmath25 extremely mild , especially in the low-@xmath8 region where the factor weighting @xmath42 , @xmath50 $ ] , behaves as @xmath51 over most of the spectrum .",
    "our model for @xmath25 is thus a very physical one , especially so in the low-@xmath8 region most relevant to the @xmath32 integral . as such",

    "lattice data typically does not reach such low @xmath8 , and some form of fitting is thus necessary to extrapolate into the peak region , at least in the conventional lattice approach .",

    "<S> a reliable evaluation of the integral giving the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment should be possible using a simple trapezoid - rule integration of lattice data for the subtracted electromagnetic current polarization function in the euclidean momentum interval @xmath0 , coupled with an @xmath1-parameter pad or other representation of the polarization in the interval @xmath2 , for sufficiently high @xmath3 and sufficiently large @xmath1 . using a physically motivated model for the @xmath4 polarization , and the covariance matrix from a recent lattice simulation to generate associated fake `` lattice data , '' </S>",
    "<S> we show that systematic errors associated with the choices of @xmath3 and @xmath1 can be reduced to well below the @xmath5 level for @xmath3 as low as @xmath6  gev@xmath7 and rather small @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> for such low @xmath3 , both an nnlo chiral representation with one additional nnnlo term and a low - order polynomial expansion employing a conformally transformed variable also provide representations sufficiently accurate to reach this precision for the low-@xmath8 contribution . </S>",
    "<S> combined with standard techniques for reducing other sources of error on the lattice determination , this hybrid strategy thus looks to provide a promising approach to reaching the goal of a sub - percent precision determination of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment on the lattice . </S>"
