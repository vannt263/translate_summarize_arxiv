    "the nineteenth and twentieth centuries may be summarized as the centuries of non - relativistic classical science and relativistic quantum science respectively .",
    "judging by the scale of activity and progress in the field , the twenty - first century may well turn out to be the century of neural science .",
    "the hard problem of consciousness and its relationship to brain function is being systematically worn down using all the quantum technologies and theories developed over the last hundred years .",
    "central to this programme is the concept of the _ observer _ , the enigmatic ` _ _ i _ _ ' of _ i think therefore i am_. the problem is that , despite the many triumphs of quantum mechanics , the physics of the observer and observation is still not well understood .",
    "an important problem is that we are not sure what the correct way to model observers mathematically is . the _ exophysical _ perspective , which assumes that observers stand outside the space - time arena in which suos ( systems under observation ) exist , remains the dominant paradigm in all the sciences .",
    "reality is different however .",
    "the empirical facts are that actual observers are part of the physical universe and can be observed by other observers . as feynman wrote @xcite : ` _ _ ... we have an illusion that we can do any experiment that we want .",
    "we all , however , come from the same universe , have evolved with it , and do nt really have any real freedom . for we obey certain laws and have come from a certain past . _ _ '",
    "this raises a question central to the interpretation of quantum mechanics : are observers just more complicated versions of suos , a view of reality known as the _ endophysical _ perspective , or are they fundamentally different altogether ?",
    "this question has been called the endo - versus - exo debate .",
    "another debate of central importance to the theory of observation involves the conflict between the classical world view and the quantum world view .",
    "the former postulates that suos and their properties exist independently of any observers or observation , whereas the latter can not make sense without them .",
    "regardless of how observers are defined and whether classical or quantum principles are involved , physicists generally believe that classical information in some form is extracted from suos in actual physics experiments . in all branches of science ,",
    "their language reflects this belief .",
    "experimentalists talk of measuring an electron s spin or the mass of a new particle , and so on . whilst this point of view is of immense practical value",
    ", it may be a fundamental conceptual error . to quote heisenberg @xcite : ` _ _",
    "the orbit _ _ [ of the electron ] _ comes into being only when we observe it_. ' it is difficult to think of any idea further from the classical world view than that one .    the conceptual issues in quantum mechanics such as wave - particle duality , quantum interference and non - locality gave the first indication that all might not be well with this perspective .",
    "we need only to look at the photon concept to appreciate some of the problems with the idea that photons are particles @xcite .",
    "developments in neuroscience are reinforcing the need to rethink the universality of the exophysical perspective .",
    "if large collections of neurons are seen to act in a coherent fashion more typical of observers than suos , then the boundaries between endo and exo physics will have been eroded .",
    "just when does a brain become an observer rather than an suo ?",
    "what seems to be missing is a dynamical theory of observation which regards observers and suos more on the same footing .",
    "in such a theory , observers would be subject to the same laws of physics as the suos that they were observing , just as feynman said in 1982 .",
    "such a theory would ideally be capable of accounting for the creation and annihilation of observers and their apparatus , because in the real world , nothing lasts forever .",
    "we are a long way from having such a theory of observation , but various authors have made some interesting comments on this topic @xcite .",
    "this paper outlines our current thoughts on the subject to date .",
    "these are based firmly on standard principles of quantum mechanics extended to cover the processes of observation .",
    "the most important idea is to discuss observation in terms of signal states of apparatus , referred to as _ labstates _ , rather than states of suos .",
    "when we look more closely at the meaning of observation , some concepts begin to emerge as more fundamental than others .",
    "perhaps the most important of all is _ contextuality _ , the idea that every statement is true or physically meaningful only relative to its context . outside of that context , nothing can or should be said about the truth or validity of that statement .",
    "contextuality makes sense of heisenberg s remark about electron trajectories , quoted above .",
    "we can not say that electron trajectories exist or otherwise if we do not observe them .",
    "we should say nothing in that context .",
    "contextuality also helps settle the particle - wave issue in quantum mechanics : there is no context in which an suo can appear to be completely a particle and completely a wave .",
    "a statement is _ absolute _ if it is true regardless of context .",
    "a central assumption of the classical world view is that there are mechanical absolutes .",
    "newton recognized the need to clarify this point and took care to make specific statements about absolute space and absolute time in his monumental book _ the principia _",
    "the problem is that quantum mechanics has no mechanical absolutes : wave - functions are contextual .",
    "contextuality leads to our first principle of quantum observation :       * principle i : * _ there are no absolutes in physics_.       with a veto on the absolute , contextuality enforces a better mental attitude towards important contextual concepts in physics such as entropy and probability .",
    "contextuality makes us wary of formalisms which treat quantum wave - functions in absolute terms , as in bohmian mechanics @xcite , the multiverse paradigm @xcite and some versions of decoherence theory @xcite .",
    "contextuality gives an answer to the epr debate @xcite , which is essentially about observation in quantum mechanics .",
    "we have to reject the concept of ` element of reality ' , slipped into the epr paper as a seductive appeal to reason .",
    "if we subscribe to that idea then we are being manipulated into accepting the classical view that suos can have absolute properties .",
    "such thinking is inconsistent with principle i stated above .",
    "contextuality and the concept of an _ equivalence class _ leads to a useful definition of what is meant by an suo .",
    "recall that an equivalence class is a subset of a set , such that all elements of that subset have some property or properties in common .",
    "those properties provide the context for the definition of that equivalence class .",
    "spekkens @xcite gives a clear discussion of these concepts as they relate to measurements .    in our approach , suos",
    "are discussed in terms of equivalence classes defined by the physics and context of a given observation , an approach used by ludwig @xcite and kraus @xcite in their work on the quantum measurement problem .",
    "we define _ relative external context _ to be those properties of and that information about the state of an suo which is washed out , or redundant , in the definition of an equivalence class , whilst _ relative internal context",
    "_ refers to the defining properties of an equivalence class associated with a given experiment .",
    "for example , in the measurement of electron spin in the stern - gerlach experiment @xcite , the momentum and position of the electron plus whatever is happening in the rest of the universe represent the relative external context whereas whether the electron is in its spin up or down state is internal context , relative to that particular experiment .",
    "the equivalence class approach leads to a second principle of quantum observation , implicit in all experimental science :       * principle ii : * _ relative external context can be ignored in any experiment_.       in standard quantum mechanics , this principle applies to state preparation as well as outcome detection .",
    "peres made the point that a prepared quantum state of a system carries no memory of how it was prepared @xcite .",
    "a point in favour of the equivalence class perspective is that it accords with the spirit of heisenberg s remark about electron trajectories quoted above , since it is clearly the apparatus which defines the equivalence classes being observed .",
    "_ classical bits _ are central to our approach , being used to represent the process of observation in its simplest possible form .",
    "a classical bit @xmath0 is a set with two distinct elements , called _",
    "classical bit states _ , plus a context which gives those states a meaning .",
    "bit states are used to label equivalence classes of suos for those situations where only two alternatives exist as far as the observer is concerned at that time .    in recent years",
    ", the quantum analogue of a bit , known as a qubit , has found many uses , particularly in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "a qubit is altogether a more complicated mathematical object than a bit .",
    "one important difference is that whereas bits are not vector spaces , qubits are complex vector spaces , which means that elements of a qubit can be multiplied by complex numbers and can be added together .",
    "another important difference is that a qubit contains a zero vector , which a bit does not .",
    "we will use the power set of a bit to get around that particular point .",
    "it will be useful to us later to briefly review some basics aspects of a qubit now .",
    "elements of a qubit @xmath1 and its dual @xmath2 are denoted by ket @xmath3 and bra @xmath4 vectors respectively .",
    "given orthonormal bases @xmath5 and @xmath6 for a qubit and its dual respectively , we define the _ projection operators _ @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the _ _ transition operators _ _ * *  * * @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "these operators satisfy the product rules given in table @xmath11 .",

    "our strategy is not to think of the suos as if they were ` there ' but to discuss only that information which an observer can extract from _ elementary signal detectors _ , or esds .",
    "each esd has only two possible normal states , known as the _ ground _ _ state _ and the _ signal _ _ state _ respectively .",
    "whenever an observer looks at a normally functioning esd , they will find it only in one of these two possible states , denoted by @xmath16 for the ground state and @xmath11 for the signal state .",
    "our approach assumes that any observation can be described in terms of collections of esds .",
    "how many esds are needed in any particular experiment will depend on context .",
    "some experiments , particularly many in quantum optics , can be described with a relatively small number of esds , whilst other experiments may require enormous numbers .",
    "an example of the latter type of experiment is the double - slit experiment , where we would require very many esds to model all the positions on the detecting screen where a photon could be detected .",
    "esds are not restricted to the detection of position in space at a given time .",
    "an esd is any process of observation which will return either a _ yes _ or a _ no _ answer . in principle",
    "this could involve a great deal of spatially extended physical equipment operated over relatively long periods of time .",
    "recent experiments in quantum optics such as the quantum eraser @xcite and delayed choice experiments @xcite have reinforced the message that the process of observation in quantum mechanics can appear not to follow classical patterns of causality or locality @xcite .",
    "a typical experiment will involve a time - dependent collection of esds .",
    "it would normally be assumed that prior to any run ( or repetition ) of the experiment , each esd would have been set in its characteristic ground state .",
    "this has nothing to do with energy .",
    "the ground state of an esd is simply whatever condition the observer regards the esd as having in the absence of a response to any external stimulus .",
    "if subsequently during the act of observation an esd were found still in its ground state , that would be taken as indicating that nothing had happened at that esd .",
    "if on the other hand an esd were found in its signal state , then something must have happened there , such as a particle impacting on a detector .",
    "there are two important caveats to this interpretation which play a crucial role in the formalism : i ) an esd might not exist , or ii ) it might exist but be faulty or decommissioned . these will be discussed in detail below .",
    "we will identify the two possible normal signal states of a functioning esd as the two elements of a bit .",
    "as we have mentioned , however , bits are not vector spaces and there seems to be no meaning to the addition of bit state @xmath16 to bit state @xmath11 , or even of the multiplication of a bit state by a real or complex number .",
    "there is in fact a way of defining bit state addition , of a kind , in terms of set theory .",
    "we recall that the _ power set _",
    "@xmath17 of a set is the set of all possible subsets of @xmath18 including the empty set @xmath19 and @xmath18 itself .",
    "the power set @xmath20 of a bit @xmath21 therefore has four distinct elements : @xmath22 , where we define @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in this scheme",
    ", @xmath27 is a non - trivial element of @xmath20 and counts as one element of the power set .",
    "we shall work in terms of the elements of @xmath20 rather than with the elements of @xmath21 itself , identifying elements @xmath28 and @xmath29 of @xmath20 as synonymous with bit states @xmath16 and @xmath11 of @xmath21 .",
    "the value of using @xmath20 rather than @xmath21 itself is that the elements of the former are sets , so we can use the set properties of _ union _ and _ intersection _ to make some interesting constructions analogous to those found in qubit theory .",
    "before we proceed further however , we need to resolve the following problem : the power set @xmath20 of a bit @xmath21 appears to have too many elements .",
    "logic suggests that only the elements @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the power set are actually needed . what can the elements @xmath30 and @xmath27 represent ?",
    "we turn to the physics of observation to answer this question .",
    "an observation of an esd can be regarded as the acquisition of an answer to a _ binary question _ , such a question being one with a _ yes _ or _ no _ answer .",
    "for example , we could ask the question @xmath31 _ is this esd in its signal state ? _ if we looked and found it was in that state , the answer would be _ yes _ and so the state of the esd would be represented by the element @xmath11 of the corresponding bit .",
    "conversely , if the esd was not found in its signal state , we would normally assume it was in its ground state and therefore we would represent that situation by the element @xmath16 .",
    "the matter is not as straightforward as it seems , however .",
    "a subtle issue arises concerning two - valued logic as it applies to physics .",
    "given an esd , there are two related binary questions .",
    "one is @xmath32 and the other is @xmath33 _ is this esd  in its ground state ?",
    "_ logically , we would assume @xmath32 and @xmath34 were conjugate questions , but physically this need not be true . in an experiment , we could not always be certain that an answer _ no _ to @xmath32 implies an answer _ yes _ to @xmath34 .",
    "the reason is that in any real experiment , @xmath32 and @xmath34 would be questions asked at different physical locations , as in the stern - gerlach experiment .",
    "we must be careful not to rely on unwarranted counterfactuality when dealing with quantum physics .",
    "we should adhere as much as possible to the following principle advocated by wheeler @xcite and peres @xcite :       * principle iii : * _ an experiment not actually done does not count_.       this principle needs to be used carefully .",
    "we _ are _ allowed , in fact _ required _ , to superpose quantum amplitudes from signal detector sources whenever we do _ not _ know which source is the real one , i.e. , when we have no which - way information .",
    "this leads to the fourth principle of observation :       * principle iv : * _ quantum superposition occurs in the absence of classical which - way information_.       the most well - known and potent demonstration of this principle is found in feynman s path integral formulation of standard quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the same principle applies also to our formalism whenever the observer chooses not to observe the signal status of particular esds @xcite .    a fundamental point concerns the existence of the esds themselves .",
    "consider what happens in a real laboratory in the execution of a given run of an experiment . before any observation of an esd",
    "could be made for that run , the observer would have had to make a decision to perform a reading on it .",
    "suppose the observer did make such a decision but was unaware that the esd never actually existed .",
    "in such a case , even if the observer had decided to make an observation , no possible answer @xmath16 or @xmath35 could be found .",
    "this scenario will be interpreted as corresponding to the empty set element @xmath27 of the power set @xmath20 . in words",
    ", @xmath27 represents the answer _",
    "yes _ to the binary question _ is it true that this esd does not exist ? _ we shall call the element @xmath27 the _",
    "empty state_.    with this possibility and the two ` normal ' possibilities of an esd being in its ground state or its signal state , we have accounted for three of the four elements of the power set @xmath20 .",
    "we account for the fourth element @xmath36 as follows .",
    "suppose that the esd did exist and was accessible to the observer but had a technical problem and gave unreliable readings .",
    "not all physical equipment works perfectly all the time .",
    "the element @xmath37 @xmath38 will be taken to represent such a scenario .",
    "essentially , any answer that the observer obtained when the esd was in state @xmath36 would be known to the observer to be uncertain or ambiguous and therefore unreliable .",
    "we shall call the element @xmath36 the _",
    "faulty state_. another interpretation of the faulty state is that the esd may have been _ decommissioned _ for one reason or another and is no longer functioning as a normal esd capable of transmitting information to other esds .",
    "now that we have an interpretation of all four elements of the power set @xmath20 we can explore the consequences of this line of thinking .",
    "the elements of the power set @xmath20 are sets themselves and therefore union and intersection are defined for them .",
    "these generate the rules of a boolean algebra , with @xmath27 playing the role of the boolean element @xmath39 and @xmath30 playing the role of the boolean element @xmath40 . in this context ,",
    "union @xmath41 and intersection @xmath42 play the roles of the idempotent , associative and commutative operations normally denoted by @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively in the theory of boolean algebras .",
    "every element @xmath45 of a boolean algebra has a complement @xmath46 , such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in our case , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the idea that observation is the process of getting answers to certain questions gives an insight into the essential difference between suos and observers .",
    "suos do not ask questions whereas observers do .",
    "we now apply this idea to bit power sets .",
    "we introduced the elements of a bit as representing the answers to a binary question .",
    "given @xmath23 represents _ no _ and @xmath53 represents _ yes _ , we denote the particular binary question involved by @xmath54 and write @xmath55 , @xmath56 . in words , @xmath54 is the compound question : _ does this esd exist , and if so , is it working normally , and if so , is it in its signal state ? _ the bit state @xmath29 returns a simultaneous _ yes _ to all three component sub - questions .",
    "we noted above that the boolean algebra of the power set @xmath57 consists of elements each of which has a complement .",
    "likewise , binary questions have their complements .",
    "the complement of the question @xmath54 will be denoted by @xmath58 , which is the binary question _ does this esd exist , and if so , is it working normally , and if so , is it in its ground state ?",
    "_ then we have the relations @xmath59 , @xmath60 .    by analogy we may introduce the questions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which have corresponding properties .",
    "we interpret @xmath63 as the question _ does this detector exist and if so , is it faulty ? _ in the case of the empty state , it is more convenient to ask about non - existence rather than existence , so we define @xmath62 as the question _ is it true that the detector does not exist ? _",
    "the situation has now become more complicated than expected , because now we have four binary questions asked of four power set states .",
    "an extension of notation is called for .",
    "we define @xmath64 and @xmath65 , whilst @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "then all sixteen question and answer relations are given by the rule@xmath68where @xmath69 is the kronecker delta .",
    "we should comment further on relations ( [ 000 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that a non - existent esd can not actually give a physical signal .",
    "the statement @xmath70 should be interpreted as @xmath71__if an esd does not exist at a place then it is not true that , if we looked , we would find a detector in its ground state at that place__@xmath72 .",
    "similarly , the statement @xmath73 is equivalent to @xmath71__if an esd does not exist at a place then it is true that , if we looked , we would not find an esd at that place__@xmath72 .    at this stage",
    "the four questions @xmath74 , @xmath75 , look like the basis elements of a dual vector space @xmath76 whilst the four answers @xmath77 , @xmath78 , look like the basis elements of a vector space @xmath79 .",
    "for this reason we shall call the elements @xmath74 the _ duals _ of the @xmath80 .",
    "however , there are significant differences which we can not expound on here , except to say that questions do not have the same status as answers : there is usually a temporal ordering relative to the observer , with questions being asked before answers can be obtained .",
    "another difference between bit questions and answers is that whilst @xmath58 and @xmath54 can be thought of as mutual complements on account of their physical interpretation , the same is not obviously the case as far as the physics of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are concerned , apart from the fact that an answer @xmath71yes@xmath72 to either tells us that the esd can be ignored for information extraction purposes .",
    "a _ bit operator _ is any mapping from the power set @xmath20 back into the power set . given an element @xmath83 of @xmath20 and a bit operator @xmath39 then we denote the value of the operator s action on @xmath83 by @xmath84 .",
    "there is a total of @xmath85 different bit operators and only a few will be of use to us .",
    "a useful way of representing bit operators is via matrices .",

    "we can write it as the formal ( dyadic ) expression @xmath93",
    ". products of bit operators are defined in the natural way : given bit operators @xmath94 , @xmath95 , we define their ` product ' @xmath96 by its action on any element @xmath80 of the power set @xmath20 according to the rule @xmath97 .",

    "classical mechanics generally assumes that suos move around continuous space continuously , but we take a different view . how observers interact with suos",

    "quantum dynamical evolution is discussed in terms of mappings from one quantum register to another and the unitary evolution operators of standard quantum mechanics are replaced by semi - unitary operators @xcite .",
    "a typical experiment described by our formalism involves an observer interacting with a time - dependent number @xmath125 of esds at a countable number of times @xmath126 , where the integer @xmath127 runs from some initial integer @xmath128 to some final integer @xmath129 .",

    "this state could be a pure state or a mixed state .",

    "a labstate carries information as to whether various esds exist in the first place and , if so , whether they are functioning normally and either in their ground or signal states , or whether they are faulty .",

    "this would be the case for discussions involving particle scattering or gravitation , for example .",

    "it all depends on what the observer is trying to do .    in the real world",
    "there is more than one observer , so a theory of observation should take account of that fact .",

    "for example , the ground state for two or more distinct observers for which some commonality of time had been established would be represented by elements in @xmath133 of the form@xmath160and so on , where superscripts refer to the different observers .",
    "if subsequent dynamics was such that the esds of observer @xmath11 never sent signals to those of observer @xmath116 and vice versa , then to all intents and purposes we could discuss each observer as if they were alone . if on the other hand some signals did pass between them , then that would be equivalent to having only one observer .",
    "if no commonality of time or other context has been established between the observers , then there can be no physical meaning to ( [ yyy ] ) .",
    "this is an important point in cosmology , where there are frequent discussions about multiple universe ` bubbles ' beyond the limits of observation .",
    "the mere fact that astronomers have received light from extremely distant galaxies establishes a context between the signal preparation esds associated with those galaxies and the esds associated with the astronomers now and validates the use of general relativity for those regions of spacetime . if no such signals have been received , then there is no such context .",
    "therefore , relative to astronomers today , the universe beyond the horizon of observation can be meaningfully represented only by the information void , not the spatial vacuum .",
    "something may be there , but we should not discuss it as if we had access to any form of information about it , such as its spacetime structure .",
    "much the same concern must be raised about the loss of information question in black hole physics .",
    "the answer to that question can come only from a careful understanding of the contextual relation between observers outside the critical radius and those that were assumed to be inside it .",
    "long before any experiment can begin , the observer starts off with a laboratory @xmath131 in its void state @xmath132 .",
    "then at some time @xmath161 before any runs can be taken , specific apparatus consisting of a finite number @xmath158 of esds has to be constructed in @xmath131 .",
    "we will assume without loss of generality that these are all functioning normally and in their ground state , so the labstate @xmath162 at that point is given by the right - hand side of ( [ lab ] ) .",
    "all of this is necessary before state preparation .",
    "according to what we said earlier , external context involving esds in their empty state can be ignored .",
    "therefore , we need only discuss those esds which subsequently are in states @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath36 .",

    "in this section , we shall restrict our attention to classical mechanics , to illustrate how our approach to observation can apply in that context .",
    "quantum mechanics is discussed after that .",
    "we consider now a physical register @xmath217 of sufficiently large fixed rank @xmath158 such that it can serve as a model for a region of classical physical space over which particles can move . in this approach ,",
    "particle motion is discussed in terms of the tracking of signals from a vast collection of esds over time .",
    "a particularly useful feature of this approach is that signality need not be conserved , which means that classical particle creation and annihilation is readily incorporated into the formalism .",
    "there are several distinct forms of temporal evolution which could be discussed in such a scenario ; the laws of mechanics for a given suo could change with time or not , the suo could be autonomous or interact with external forces , and signality could be conserved or not . we shall restrict our attention to autonomous suos with time - independent laws of dynamics , as these are generally of most interest . in principle , there should be no problem in dealing with other forms of dynamics , including those where the rank of the physical register changes with time .",
    "we could also deal with classical stochastic mechanics , which would incorporate bayesian principles in a natural way .    in the following ,",
    "all states are elements in the universal register @xmath133 which also belong to @xmath217 , i.e. , they represent the labstates of a fixed collection of normal esds , each of which can be found only in either its ground state or signal state .",

    "there are in principle @xmath216 possible states @xmath219 into which it could be mapped , and because there are @xmath216 values of @xmath220 , we conclude that for a rank-@xmath158 classical register , there are @xmath226 distinct possible evolution operators in this form of mechanics .",
    "even for very low rank physical registers , the number of possible operators is impressive .",
    "for example , a rank-@xmath116 register can have @xmath227 different forms of autonomous , time - independent dynamics whilst a rank-@xmath228 register has @xmath229 different forms .",
    "most of the possible evolution operators over a physical register will not be useful .",
    "many of them will correspond to irreversible and/or unphysical dynamical evolution and only a small subset will be of interest .",
    "we need to find some principles to guide us in our choice of evolution operator .",
    "recall that in standard classical mechanics , hamilton s equations of motion lead to liouville s theorem .",
    "this tells us that as we track a small volumeelement along a classical trajectory , this volume remains constant in magnitude though not necessarily constant in shape or orientation .",
    "this leads to the idea that a system of many non - interacting particles moving along classical trajectories in phase - space behaves like an incompressible fluid , such a phenomenon being referred to as a hamiltonian flow .",
    "an important characteristic of hamiltonian flows is that flow lines never cross .",
    "we shall encode this idea into our approach to signal mechanics .",
    "there are two versions of this mechanics , one of which does not necessarily conserve signality whilst the other does .",
    "we consider the first one now .",
    "the physical register @xmath217 contains @xmath216 labstates denoted by @xmath214 , @xmath230 .",
    "consider a permutation @xmath231 of the integers @xmath220 , such that under @xmath231 , @xmath232 $ ] .",
    "define the evolution of the labstate @xmath214 over one time step by @xmath233 .",
    "such a process is reversible and will be referred to as a _ permutation flow_.    there is a total of @xmath234 distinct permutations of n objects , so there are ( @xmath235 possible distinct permutation flow processes . for large @xmath158 ,",
    "the number of permutation flows is a rapidly decreasing fraction of the number ( @xmath236 of all possible forms of register processes .",
    "most permutation flows will not conserve signality .",
    "we can readily identify the subset of the permutation flows which do conserve signality by using the occupancy notation . consider a physical register state @xmath237 at time @xmath126 given by @xmath238 in the occupancy notation , where @xmath168 or else @xmath11 for @xmath239 .",
    "now let @xmath240 be some permutation of the numbers @xmath241 and write @xmath242 to represent the number that @xmath173 changes to under this permutation .",
    "now suppose that @xmath237 evolves into the labstate @xmath243 at time @xmath244 given by @xmath245to determine the new occupancy of the @xmath177 bit , we just look at the occupancy of the ( @xmath246 bit .",
    "this may be summarized as the dynamical rule @xmath247 .",
    "we shall call this form of signal mechanics _ signal permutation dynamics . _    in this form of dynamics , signality is automatically conserved .",
    "another way of seeing this is to use the signal creation operators and note that if @xmath237 has signality @xmath248 , then we can write @xmath249 , where @xmath250 . then under the above permutation @xmath240 of the integers",
    "@xmath241 the new state at time @xmath244 takes the form@xmath251then clearly signality is conserved .",
    "the total number of distinct permutations of @xmath158 objects is @xmath252 , so there are that many distinct forms of signal permutation dynamics for a rank-@xmath158 classical register .",
    "since there are @xmath253 distinct forms of permutation dynamics , the set of signal permutation dynamics forms a rapidly decreasing fraction of the set of all possible permutation dynamics .",
    "permutation flows have a number of features which have analogues in standard classical mechanics .",
    "first , permutation flows are reversible . given a permutation @xmath231 , then its inverse @xmath254 always exists , because permutations form a group .",
    "another feature of permutation dynamics is the existence of _ orbits _ or _ cycles . _",
    "_  _ _ permutation of @xmath216 objects will in general contain cycles , which are subsets of the objects such that only elements within a given cycle replace each other under the permutation .",
    "this is relevant here because we have chosen to discuss time - independent autonomous systems , the evolution of which is given by repeated applications of the same permutation .",
    "therefore , the structure of the cycles does not change and so each cycle consisting of @xmath255 elements has a dynamical period @xmath255 . for example",
    ", the identity permutation gives a trivial form of mechanics where nothing changes .",
    "it has @xmath216 cycles each of period @xmath11 . at the other end of the spectrum ,",
    "the permutation denoted by @xmath256 has no cycles except itself and has period @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , any physical register evolving under time independent , autonomous permutation mechanics must return to its initial labstate no later than after @xmath216 time steps .",
    "this is the analogue of the poincar recurrence theorem @xcite .",
    "any experiment consists of several distinct phases . we have discussed the creation of the apparatus and the evolution of the labstates .",
    "now we turn to the process of measurement itself , which denotes the extraction of classical information from an suo .",
    "typically this information will be in the form of real numbers , and these can always be expressed in binary form , justifying our approach .",
    "context plays a vital role here .",
    "when for example an observer reports that a particle has been observed at position @xmath257 , what they mean is that positive signals have been detected at some normal esd or esds associated with the number @xmath257 .",
    "this assignment is based on the context of the experiment : the observer will know on the basis of prior theoretical knowledge what those esds mean in terms of the physics of the suo concerned , and therefore , what @xmath71values@xmath72 of some measurable quantity they represent .",
    "so far we have discussed the evolution on labstates . for each run or repetition of the experiment ,",
    "this is modeled by the action of an evolution operator @xmath258 mapping initial labstates at time @xmath259 into final labstates at time @xmath260 .",
    "we need now to discuss how numbers are extracted at the end of an experiment consisting of a number of runs .    with reference to the position measurement",
    "discussed immediately above , we model the measurement process in terms of _ weighted relevant questions_. what this means is this .",
    "suppose the final physical register @xmath261 has rank @xmath262 .",
    "assuming the experimentalist has established that each esd is normal , then there will be a total of @xmath263 possible normal labstates in this register .",
    "therefore , the observer could ask a total of d@xmath264 normal questions .",
    "these questions are represented by the dual labstates @xmath265 . given a final labstate @xmath266 , the answer _",
    "_ no _ to each question @xmath267 @xmath71__is it true that _ _",
    "@xmath266 is @xmath214__?__@xmath72 is represented by the number one or zero respectively , and given by the bracket @xmath268 .",
    "now the observer will generally have some theory as to what each answer @xmath214 means physically .",
    "in many experiments , this will be some real number @xmath269 .",
    "therefore , the actual number @xmath270 obtained at time @xmath260 at end of a single run of the experiment can be written in the form@xmath271where @xmath272 is an _ observable _",
    ", a sum of dyadics representing a weighted relevant question .",
    "two comments are relevant .",
    "first , despite appearances , this is still a classical theory at this point .",
    "the final labstate @xmath266 is a single element in the final physical register , @xmath261 , not a superposition of elements .",
    "second , there is nothing in classical mechanics which rules out weighted sums of dyadics . for any element in @xmath273 , all the possible answers @xmath268 are zero except for one of them , so ( [ ask ] ) returns a physically sensible value for @xmath274 .",
    "a further refinement , anticipating the possibility of random variations in the initial state and the extension of these ideas to quantum mechanics is to write@xmath275where @xmath276 represents the familiar trace process and @xmath277 is the dyadic @xmath278 analogous to a pure state density matrix in quantum mechanics .",
    "we note that @xmath279 and @xmath280 , where the evolution operator @xmath281 maps elements of @xmath282 into elements of @xmath261 and similarly for the dual evolution operator @xmath283 . in general",
    ", it will be true that @xmath284the identity operator for @xmath282 .",
    "however , because there is no requirement formally in this approach for the rank @xmath262 of the final physical register @xmath261 to equal the rank @xmath285 of the initial physical register @xmath282 , it is possible that @xmath286 does not equal @xmath287 .",
    "this corresponds to irreversible dynamics . in the analogous quantum formalism",
    "we have developed @xcite , such evolution operators are referred to as _ semi - unitary_.    using ( [ semi ] ) in ( [ av ] ) ,",
    "we may write @xmath288 , where @xmath289 is the initial dyadic @xmath290 .      real experiments normally consist of a large number of repetitions or runs of a basic process .",
    "however , it can not always be guaranteed that the initial labstate is always the same . in principle",
    ", we could start with any one of @xmath291 initial labstates .",
    "in such a case , a statistical approach can be taken .",
    "consider a very large number @xmath292 of runs , such that there is a total of @xmath293 runs starting with initial labstate @xmath214 , for @xmath294 .",
    "clearly , @xmath295 . then in the limit of @xmath292 tending to infinity , we would assign a probability @xmath296 for the initial labstate to be in state @xmath214 .",

    "the formalism outlined above then gives the expectation values of operators .",
    "the formalism we have developed is readily extended to the quantum scenario , for which different principles hold concerning the interpretation and usage of the physical register . in this scenario ,",
    "a rank @xmath125 physical register @xmath164 at time @xmath127 is identified with a preferred orthonormal basis @xmath301 for a quantum register @xmath302 , where now the @xmath303 are qubits .",
    "this register is a hilbert space , the tensor product of @xmath125 qubits , each of which is identified with one esd .",
    "elements of this register are the labstates of interest and these can be multiplied by complex numbers and added together , unlike the classical scenario .",
    "most of the formulae developed in the previous section can be taken wholesale into the quantum scenario .",

    "the approach follows that discussed in @xcite . in the schematic mach - zehnder circuit shown in figure 1",
    ", each numbered circle represents an esd , or place where the observer could extract information in principle .",
    "the rectangles represent beam - splitters and the solid bars represent mirrors .",
    "our convention is that a reflected beam undergoes a phase change of @xmath307 whilst a transmission results in a phase change of @xmath308 . for each run of the experiment ,",
    "a bomb is taken from the untested stockpile of bombs and is placed in contact with esd  2 , such that if the bomb is a dud ( d ) then esd 2 acts normally and transmits onto esd 5 .",
    "if on the other hand the bomb is active ( a ) , then whenever the signal state is triggered at esd2 the bomb explodes . in this case , esd 2 becomes _ faulty _ and does not transmit onto esd 5 .",
    "this experiment involves a randomly changing apparatus network , because the bomb being tested in a given run is immediately replaced by a new bomb from the unused stockpile .",
    "there are therefore two distinct networks to consider .",
    "we have to deal with each of these separately , for which a pure labstate description can be used",
    ". then we use a density matrix approach to consider the combined experiment .    for each of the pure labstate calculations , the labstate , or current signal state of the network ,",
    "is discussed in the schrdinger picture . at any stage @xmath127",
    ", the current labstate will be written in the form @xmath309 .",
    "we define the contextual vacuum @xmath310 , where @xmath156 is the construction operator for the @xmath311 esd .",
    "starting at time @xmath312 , the initial labstate @xmath313 changes by the following sequence of stages , or opportunities for information extraction from the apparatus : @xmath314we find @xmath315 . hence no dud bomb ever coincides with a signal in esd 7 .      in this case , the initial labstate is given by @xmath316 , where @xmath317 is the decommissioning operator for esd i. in this case we have @xmath318 using @xmath319 , the state @xmath320 represents an explosion at esd 2 coincident with no signal at either esd 6 or 7 .",
    "hence this calculation gives the outcome probabilities @xmath321 , @xmath322 .",
    "unfortunately , the observer does not know before each run whether a particular bomb is active or a dud . consider a sequence of runs such that there is a ( classical ) probability @xmath323 of encountering an active bomb and a probability @xmath324 of a dud . in this case",
    "we take a density matrix approach . at the @xmath325 stage",
    "we define the density matrix @xmath326the overall probability of triggering esd 6 at the third stage is given by@xmath327 where @xmath328 is the signal projection operator for the @xmath311 esd , and likewise , @xmath329 the interpretation is that every signal at esd 7 tells the observer that the current bomb on test is active . moreover , that bomb has not exploded and can be used .",
    "this method allows one quarter of the active bombs in the stockpile to be identified with a single sweep of the stockpile .",
    "further iteration of this experiment on unexploded bombs coinciding with a signal from esd 6 pushes this result up to one third of the total , the rest of the active bombs having exploded during testing .",
    "the elitzur - vaidman bomb - tester experiment may be interpreted as a simplified form of double - slit experiment , where the screen has only two sites and one of the slits can be blocked off or not , depending on whether a bomb is active or dud .",
    "this blocking off occurs in a classical way , because the uncertainty as to whether the bomb is active or dud is not intrinsic to the nature of the bomb but reflects the observer s ignorance of the nature of the bomb .",
    "a spectacular variant of the bomb - tester experiment is known as the hardy paradox experiment @xcite . in this variant ,",
    "the blocking off of a slit occurs in an intrinsically quantum stochastic way , contrasted to the classically stochastic way of the bomb - tester experiment .",
    "the experiment consists of an electron - positron pair passing through two coupled mach - zehnder - type networks shown in figure 2 .",
    "the curvature of the tracks occurs because of suitable magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane of the network shown .        in conventional terminology",
    ", the presence of the positron at esd 3 would effectively block one of the slits , i.e. , the slit corresponding to esd 4 , through which the electron wavefunction would otherwise pass .",
    "conversely , the absence of the positron at esd 3 allows both slits 4 and 5 to be open as far as the electron is concerned . by symmetry ,",
    "the same remarks apply to the interchange of the electron and positron .",
    "the hardy paradox experiment is intrinsically a pure quantum experiment , in that we can discuss it via pure labstates alone .",
    "an important point is that electron - positron annihilation is a well - known quantum process which occurs in nature , whereas the detonation mechanism of the eliztur - vaidman bomb - tester is left unspecified .",
    "we start our analysis of the hardy paradox experiment by defining the contextual vacuum @xmath330 .",
    "then the initial state is given by @xmath331 .",
    "the dynamics follows the following sequence : @xmath332    using the labstate evolutions @xmath333we find @xmath334 the state @xmath335 is interpreted as the occurrence of electron - positron annihilation , as shown by the wavy lines in figure 2 , so we read off the following conditional probabilities : @xmath336the paradox is that @xmath337 , which conventional logical suggests could occur only if both particles had passed through esds 3 and 4 simultaneously _ without _ annihilation , contrary to expectation .",
    "the application of our quantized model of observation to the elitzure - vaidman bomb - tester and hardy paradox experiments demonstrates that the concept of faulty or decommissioned states has physical significance .",
    "this paper was motivated in part by a dissatisfaction with conventional approaches to quantum observation : in our view , too much attention is paid to states of suos and too little to the context of their observation . despite the calculational successes of the conventional approach",
    ", it seems to us that there is something deep still missing throughout physics , viz . , a comprehensive dynamical theory of observation .",
    "such a theory should be able to clarify the relationship between the suo , observer and apparatus concepts , which may lead to the resolution of long standing issues in quantum mechanics .",
    "we hope that this paper may be of some value in suggesting new lines of research in this area ."
