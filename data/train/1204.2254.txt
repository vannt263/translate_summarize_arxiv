    "itinerant ferromagnets crystallizing in noncentrosymmetric space groups have attracted much attention recently .",
    "the key factor is that the lack of an inversion center in the crystal lattice means that dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) spin - orbit interactions are allowed .",
    "@xcite these interactions add a term to the free energy @xmath2 favoring perpendicular orientation of the spins . in metallic systems",
    "the dm term can lead to helimagnetism @xcite and complex spin textures resembling liquid crystal phases when the helimagnetism is destabilized .",

    "recently this phase has been identified as a skyrmion lattice .",
    "@xcite skyrmions are a direct result of dm interactions allowed in the crystal lattice with no inversion symmetry .",
    "similar spin textures have been observed in two other materials so far , fege @xcite and fe@xmath7co@xmath8si , @xcite both having the same structure as mnsi .",
    "cr@xmath9nbs@xmath10 is another example where the dm interaction is responsible for the helimagnetism .",
    "@xcite in this material the period of the helix is @xmath11  , and the dm interaction is thought to be stabilized by the lack of an inversion center between the two chromium atoms along the c axis as it crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group @xmath126@xmath1322 .",
    "recently , lorentz microscopy and small - angle electron diffraction studies showed an emergence in the applied magnetic field of a periodic and nonlinear magnetic order called a chiral magnetic soliton lattice in addition to the the zero - field chiral helimagnetic structure .",
    "@xcite    indeed , there are many other ferromagnets that crystallize in space groups lacking an inversion center . however , until now , both the theoretical and experimental studies have been concentrated mostly within the materials with the cubic b20 crystal structure",

    "both the experimental results and calculations indicate that cr@xmath0ge@xmath1 is a good example of an itinerant electron ferromagnet , with signatures of both spin wave excitations and magnetic fluctuations apparent in the data .",
    "although no direct evidence for a helimagnetic or other exotic magnetic ground state has been found in the polycrystalline samples we have studied , the behavior of this material is unusual in several respects and deserves further study in single crystal form .",
    "polycrystalline samples were prepared and studied .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of high purity cr pieces ( 99.999 @xmath18 ) and ge pieces ( 99.9999 @xmath18 ) were arc - melted in an argon atmosphere .",
    "the resulting ingot was then sealed in a quartz tube and annealed at 900 @xmath19c for one week .",

    "the arc - melted ingot was broken into pieces and loaded into a well - cleaned quartz tube of 14 mm inner diameter with a pointed bottom forming a bridgman crucible .",

    "it was then cooled quickly to 1000 @xmath19c and then slowly cooled to 900 @xmath19c at the rate of 2 @xmath19c per hour which was subsequently furnace - cooled to room temperature .",
    "tiny cube - shaped crystals with a typical dimension of 0.1 mm were always observed in the middle of the resulting boule .    room temperature x - ray diffraction on powders from pulverized single crystals confirmed single phase for the crystals obtained in both techniques .",
    "the atomic ratio was studied using a hitachi bench - top scanning electron microscope ( sem ) with a bruker energy dispersive x - ray spectrometer ( eds ) .",
    "the atomic percentages of cr and ge observed are 42 at.@xmath18 and 58 at.@xmath18 , respectively , which is within the expected uncertainty for standardless measurements on irregular surfaces .",
    "crystals obtained from modified bridgman method were too small for convenient characterization , while the relatively larger crystals grown by flux method typically had some residual ge flux on the crystal surface .",
    "therefore in this study we characterized polycrystalline material , which was @xmath2098% pure based on powder diffraction and eds measurements .",
    "all the measurements were carried out in pieces cut from the same compact polycrystalline pellet that was determined to be 82@xmath18 of the theoretical density .",

    "these dos are depicted in fig . [ 11 ] .",
    "the nonmagnetic state [ fig . [ 11](a ) ] shows a huge peak in the density of states exactly at the fermi energy , highly favorable towards a stoner - type ferromagnetic instability ( recall the stoner criterion @xmath92 , where i is the exchange correlation integral and n@xmath93 the fermi level density of states ) .",
    "this dos is in rough agreement with the non - self - consistent band structure calculations of ref . . with i for cr taken from ref",
    "as 0.38 ev and the fermi level dos of approximately 5.7/cr / ev , the stoner criterion is well satisfied , and as described earlier this fits with the magnetic ground state we find .",
    "we turn now to the magnetic state dos [ fig .",
    "[ 11](b ) ] .",
    "the majority spin - up dos still has a peak very near @xmath94 , but this peak is much lower than in the nonmagnetic case .",
    "substantial spectral weight for the spin - up states is transferred below e@xmath95 , as is expected for the majority spin , while the spin - down dos is somewhat more equally distributed above and below e@xmath95 .",
    "we note also that the strongly magnetic nature of this system is paralleled by the spin - up and spin - down dos not coinciding until several ev from the fermi level .",
    "we note also that the band gap has disappeared , with instead a deep minimum in the spin - up dos just above e@xmath95 and a somewhat less deep minimum in the spin - down dos .",
    "this band gap absence , to be compared with its existence in the nonmagnetic state , is again indicative of the strong magnetism present in this material .",
    "the results presented here , both from experiment and first principles calculations , indicate unusual magnetism in cr@xmath0ge@xmath1 .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization and heat capacity suggest itinerant , noncollinear ferromagnetism with a curie temperature near 88 k , and this description is supported by first principles calculations .",
    "the magnetism appears to be strongly coupled to the crystal lattice , as indicated by anomalous behavior of the lattice parameters and the elastic moduli at and below @xmath96 .",
    "the influence of spin - wave excitations is observed in the heat capacity at low temperature .",
    "interestingly , some of the properties are similar to those of mnsi and other itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "it is interesting to speculate about possible helimagnetism in cr@xmath0ge@xmath1 , based on the observed properties and the nature of the crystal structure .",
    "however , the present data can not confirm the magnetic structure , and single crystals of suitable size for neutron diffraction are not yet available .",
    "our observations clearly point to complex and interesting magnetism in this compound , and show that further study would be of interest .",
    "we thank s. e. nagler for stimulating discussions and u. k. r@xmath97ler for pointing out that magnetic vortices have been predicted to form in the space group to which cr@xmath0ge@xmath1 belongs .",
