    "in recent years , many theoretical as well as experimental investigations in condensed matter physics have been devoted to the study of low - dimensional strongly correlated electron systems where long - range coulomb interactions play an important role .",
    "a crucial problem is to understand the effects of competing interactions and the corresponding phase transitions .",
    "one of the seminal models adopted to take into account long - range coulomb interactions is the so - called extended hubbard model ( ehm ) , which , beside the on - site interaction @xmath1 , contains also a nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 .",
    "although the ehm looks deceptively simple and in spite of a very intensive study , both analytical and numerical , there is no complete exact solution even in @xmath5 .",
    "these difficulties have led to the investigation of the so - called atomic limit of the extended hubbard model ( al - ehm ) . according to the conventional definition used in the literature",
    ", the atomic limit stands for the classical limit of the model , where the hopping matrix elements @xmath6 are set to zero from the very beginning .",
    "the al - ehm is exactly solvable in one dimension ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) , as well as when it is defined on the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "here we consider the bethe lattice as the infinite version of a cayley tree ; thus we are not concerned with surface effects .",
    "the bethe lattice , beside being an useful framework for studying the electronic structure of amorphous and glassy solids , has a relevant role in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics . due to its peculiar structure , on the bethe lattice",
    "it is possible to exactly solve several interesting physical problems involving interactions @xcite .",
    "there are two special properties that make bethe lattices particularly suited for theoretical investigations : the self - similar structure which may lead to recursive solutions and the absence of closed loops which restricts interference effects of quantum - mechanical particles in the case of nearest - neighbor coupling .",
    "furthermore , bethe and bethe - like lattices have attracted a lot of interest because they usually reflect essential features of systems even when conventional mean - field theories fail @xcite .",
    "the reason is that such lattices are capable to take into account correlations which are usually lost in conventional mean - field calculations .",
    "very recently , the bethe lattice has been considered as the underlying lattice to study the suppression of the paramagnetic metal - insulator transition in the hubbard model at half - filling in the presence of nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hoppings when the latter is increased with respect to the former @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exist in nature hyperbranched polymers with distinct regular molecular architecture ( so - called dendrimers ) which can be conveniently modelized by a bethe - like hamiltonian @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we study the al - ehm on the bethe lattice by means of the equations of motion approach @xcite . for one - dimensional lattices , or more generally for lattices with no closed loops , classical fermionic and spin systems",
    "can be easily solved by means of the transfer matrix method @xcite . however , this method is hardy implementable when more complex lattices are considered .",
    "the onsager solution for the two - dimensional ising model is an emblematic example @xcite .",
    "we feel that there is the necessity to foster alternative methods which can be used for a large class of lattices . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the equations of motion method provides an answer to this exigency . by using this method , localized fermionic systems and ising - like models can be in principle solved for any underlying lattice . indeed , one can find a set of eigenenergies and eigenoperators of the hamiltonian which closes the hierarchy of the equations of motion . as a result",
    ", one can derive exact analytical expressions for the relevant green s functions and correlation functions , which turn out to depend on a finite set of parameters .",
    "the knowledge of these parameters is essential to obtain a solution of these models . in a series of articles",
    "@xcite , we have analyzed several fermionic and spin systems and we have developed a self - consistent method which allows us to determine these parameters for the case of one - dimensional and bethe lattices .",
    "some preliminary results for the al - ehm on the bethe lattice were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , where we considered only the case of attractive intersite interactions ( @xmath4 ) . upon varying the temperature",
    ", we found a region of negative compressibility , hinting at a transition from a thermodynamically stable to an unstable phase , characterized by phase separation . in this paper , we provide a comprehensive and systematic exact analysis of the al - ehm on the bethe lattice with coordination number @xmath0 by considering relevant response and correlation functions as well as thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we consider both the cases @xmath4 and @xmath3 and cover a wide range of values of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 ( @xmath7 is the particle density and @xmath8 the temperature ) . the possibility for the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 to take positive as well as negative values - representing effective interaction couplings taking into account also other interactions ( for instance with phonons ) - gives rise to a rich phenomenology and a variety of phases . in particular , the ratio of the two competing terms in the model hamiltonian , i.e. , the on - site and the intersite interactions , determines the different distributions of the electrons and the accessible phases , which we identified as charge ordered ( co ) or phase separated ( ps ) .",
    "indeed , several studies of the ehm on regular lattices have pointed at the presence of states with phase separation @xcite and of charge - ordered phases @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the introduction of an intersite interaction can mimic longer - ranged coulomb interactions needed to describe effects observed in conducting polymers @xcite . in this article , we report the phase diagram in the space ( @xmath9 ) showing the existence of critical regions where charge ordering ( @xmath3 ) and phase separation ( @xmath4 ) are observed .",
    "these studies have not been reported in the literature and bring some more information on the properties of the hubbard model .",

    ", there is a critical temperature @xmath163 , located by the divergence of the charge susceptibility , at which there is a transition from a thermodynamically stable to an unstable phase ; the latter is characterized by phase separation .",
    "the surface separating the two phases has a rounded vault in the 3d ( @xmath7 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 ) space , which splits in two for @xmath375 .",
    "below @xmath163 , the same critical value of the on - site potential separates the two possible configurations of phase separated states , namely clusters of singly or doubly occupied sites . for repulsive nearest - neighbor interactions ,",
    "the phase diagram has a richer structure : we found a transition temperature below which translational invariance is broken .",
    "the bethe lattice effectively splits in two sublattices with different thermodynamic properties . as a result , a charge ordered phase , characterized by a different distribution of the electrons in alternating shells , is established for @xmath376 . the co phase is energetically favored as demonstrated by the study of the helmholtz free energy . by investigating the behavior of several thermodynamic quantities",
    ", we attained a full comprehension of the phase diagram .",
    "the study of the particle density and of the double occupancy is particularly enlightening to unveil the distribution of the particles on the sites of the bethe lattice .",
    "the specific heat exhibits not only high and low temperature peaks due to charge excitations induced by the hubbard operators @xmath308 and @xmath309 , but also peaks due to the phase transition from the homogeneous phase to the co state ( or viceversa ) . by studying separately the contribution to the charge and spin susceptibilities coming from the two sublattices , the onset of a co phase is also signalled by the separation of the values of the sublattices quantities @xmath377 and @xmath378 .",
    "the different population of the two sublattices in the co phase is reflected by the divergence or the vanishing , in the limit @xmath379 , of the spin susceptibilities @xmath357 and @xmath358 .",
    "if the electrons are paired , no alignment of the spin is possible ( @xmath380 ) , whereas single occupation of the sites leads to an alignment ( @xmath381 ) even when the magnetic field is turned off .",
    "we thank a. naddeo for her contribution to the initial stages of this work and a. avella for stimulating discussions and a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath154 , the hamiltonian of the al - ehm reads : @xmath382 where @xmath383 is the third component of the spin density operator @xmath384 the formulation given in section [ sec_ii ] for the case of a bethe lattice must be generalized in order to take into account the breaking of rotational invariance in the spin space : one has to distinguish the two components - in the spinorial notation - of the fermionic fields . by exploiting the decomposition , it is not difficult to show that the presence of the magnetic field affects only @xmath114 . in this representation",
    "the equations of motion of the hubbard operators become @xmath385 & = - \\left ( \\mu + \\sigma h   \\right ) \\xi_{\\sigma } ( i ) , \\\\ \\left",
    "[ \\eta_{\\sigma } ( i),h_0 \\right ] & = -\\left(\\mu + \\sigma h - u \\right)\\eta_{\\sigma } ( i ) ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] and eqs . are modified as : @xmath386 all the rest of formulation developed in sections [ sec_ii ] , [ sec_iii ] and [ sec_iv ] follows easily .",
