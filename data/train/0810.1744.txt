    "a decade after the first firm evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , the study of dark energy remains one of the most important yet difficult endeavors in theoretical cosmology ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the quality of data from a variety of cosmological probes has strengthened in recent years @xcite , leading to multiple , independent lines of evidence for the accelerating expansion . in the near future , we can expect a battery of measurements with unprecedented precision that will provide stringent tests of any purported explanation of cosmic acceleration .    despite the tremendous amount of raw information expected from upcoming type ia supernova ( sn ) surveys , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from galaxy redshift surveys , weak lensing , and cluster counting surveys , only a handful of parameters associated with the dark energy equation of state can be constrained @xcite .",
    "this limitation arises because most observables depend on cosmological distances and growth , which are integrals over the expansion rate , which itself contains an integral over the dark energy equation of state .",
    "although insensitivity to fine - scale features of the equation of state is a drawback for measuring dark energy parameters , it is an advantage for testing the consistency among acceleration observables required by dark energy paradigms ; since the individual probes of dark energy do not depend strongly on the rapidly oscillating evolution of the equation of state , neither do the consistency relations between these observables .",
    "for example , it is well known that under a cosmological constant explanation of acceleration or simple parametrizations of the equation of state , distance measurements predict the growth of structure in a spatially flat universe .",
    "violation of this consistency relation would falsify the standard flat @xmath0cdm  model and its most basic generalizations .",
    "the goal of this study is to extend these ideas of prediction and falsification from simple dark energy parametrizations to general classes of dark energy models with time - dependent equations of state , specifically scalar field quintessence and dark energy that is spatially smooth compared with the dark matter on small scales .",
    "we start with sn and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements expected in the next decade and make predictions for growth and expansion history measurements as a function of redshift within dark energy model classes parametrized by a complete basis of principal components . where predictions are tight , observations can falsify the model class . where predictions are loose , observations can better pin down the parameters of the class , in particular those controlling spatial curvature and dark energy that is significant at early times .",
    "our study complements previous work @xcite on the observable predictions of classes of dark energy models , and follows a long history of studies concerning the best way to probe dark energy using cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge this is the first time that consistency between growth , distance , and other expansion observables has been studied in such a general and quantitative way .",
    "in particular , while some previous studies have considered predictions of dark energy described with a small number of parameters ( e.g.  @xcite ) , here we consider @xmath1 parameters of which about @xmath2 are necessary to completely describe to high accuracy the predictions of current or future data .",
    "although we compute equations of state for dark energy as an intermediate step between distance and growth , we emphasize that our goal is _ not _ to reconstruct @xmath3 , unlike many previous studies ( e.g.@xcite ) . rather than addressing the quality of constraints on the equation of state , here we are more interested in using dark energy parameters only as a tool to study how to falsify basic paradigms for cosmic acceleration .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : prelim ] , we describe our methods for computing predictions for observables from future cosmological data under different dark energy paradigms .",
    "these predictions can lead to falsification and subsequent generalization of each model class as shown in ",
    "[ sec : dectree ] .",
    "the main tests of each class are summarized in   [ sec : conc ] .",
    "appendices provide additional details about the inclusion of various data in the construction of principal components and in the likelihood analysis , our methodology for computing the principal components , and tests of the completeness of our parametrization in the growth and expansion observables .",
    "we parametrize the dark energy equation of state , @xmath3 , with a basis of principal components ( pcs ) @xcite .",
    "the pc amplitudes are weighted redshift averages of @xmath3 ordered by how well they are measured , and can be straightforwardly computed for a given data set . as we discuss in ",
    "[ sec : observ ] and  [ sec : tests ] , principal components based on sn distance modulus data in particular provide a nearly complete basis for other acceleration observables .",
    "we therefore treat the pc amplitudes as simply a convenient intermediate representation to capture the information in the distance modulus and translate it into predictions for other observables .",
    "principal components can also be defined for other redshift - dependent quantities such as the dark energy density @xmath4 ( e.g.  @xcite ) which is related to @xmath3 by @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the critical density and @xmath7 is the fraction of dark energy , both at the present time .",
    "@xcite discuss the advantages of using either @xmath3 or @xmath4 to describe dark energy .",
    "our choice to use @xmath3 is motivated by the fact that the model classes we consider are separated by the allowed values of @xmath8 : @xmath9 for @xmath0cdm  and @xmath10 for quintessence .",
    "( values of @xmath8 outside this range are possible for quintessence models in which the dark energy density becomes negative , but such models are inconsistent with current data as we discuss in   [ sec : tree2 ] . )    specifically , we compute the pcs based on distances to type ia supernovae with measurement errors modeled after the proposed specifications for the supernova / acceleration probe ( snap @xcite ) experiment .",
    "we also assume that 300 low-@xmath11 sne will be available for calibrating the normalization of the high-@xmath11 distance - redshift relation .",
    "we supplement the sn observables with constraints on the expansion history at earlier times from the cmb acoustic peaks using the precision expected from the planck mission .",
    "we take the cmb observables to be the matter density scaled to the present , @xmath12 , and the comoving angular diameter distance to last scattering , @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "our assumptions about these fiducial sn and cmb data sets and additional priors are detailed in appendix  [ app : data ] .",
    "the fiducial cosmology we assume for the pc construction ( and for likelihood analysis ) is flat @xmath0cdm  with present matter fraction @xmath15 and hubble constant @xmath16 , consistent with current data @xcite .",
    "the principal component functions @xmath17 are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix for the equation of state in redshift bins @xmath18 , and they form a basis in which an arbitrary function @xmath19 may be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the pc amplitudes , @xmath22 is the number of bins in redshift , and @xmath23 .",
    "we adopt a maximum redshift for variations in @xmath3 of @xmath24 to match the largest redshift for our fiducial supernova data , and we use a fiducial model @xmath25 since @xmath0cdm  is an excellent fit to current data . for these choices of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , fig .",
    "[ fig : pcs ] shows the 15 lowest - variance pcs , which form the basis we use for likelihood analysis .",
    "we comment on how the pcs depend on the choices of @xmath26 and the fiducial cosmology in appendix  [ app : pcs ] .    by normalizing the pcs as @xmath28 ^ 2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{{n_{z,{\\rm pc } } } } [ e_i(z_j)]^2 = { n_{z,{\\rm pc } } } , \\label{eq : norm}\\ ] ] the components approach a `` continuum limit '' as @xmath29 in which the shapes of all but the worst - determined pcs become smooth and independent of @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) .",
    "a small bin width @xmath32 also allows us to resolve changes in @xmath3 at redshifts below that of the nearest supernova in the sample , @xmath33 , which can evade sn constraints as discussed in appendix  [ app : pcs ] .",
    "we have chosen to use bins spaced linearly in redshift , and the exact shapes of the components depend somewhat on this choice ; for example , had we chosen bins with equal widths in @xmath34 or @xmath35 , the weights of the pcs would have shifted in redshift @xcite .",
    "however , the most important property of the pcs for our purposes is that they form a complete basis for observables such as distance and growth (   [ sec : tests ] ) , and this completeness can be achieved for a variety of different binning conventions .",
    "although we use a large number of redshift bins ( @xmath36 ) to approach the continuum limit of the pc shapes , we generally truncate the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pcstow ] ) to include only the @xmath37 modes that are measured best by the fiducial data",
    ". predictions in   [ sec : dectree ] are based on a choice of @xmath38 , and we explain how this number of pcs ensures completeness in various observables in   [ sec : tests ] .    0.25 cm [ fig : pcs ]    for model classes that restrict @xmath3 to some range @xmath39 , we can place priors on the pc amplitudes analogous to those introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for reionization principal components .",
    "these priors , which we define in appendix  [ app : data ] , include top - hat bounds on each pc amplitude and an upper limit on the sum of squares of the amplitudes . due to the truncation of the number of principal components required for likelihood analysis",
    ", we adopt conservative priors . a combination of pc amplitudes is only excluded if the resulting equation of state at some redshift exceeds the bounds on @xmath8 _ regardless _ of the amplitudes of the truncated components ( @xmath40 with @xmath41 ) .",
    "conversely , satisfying the pc priors does not guarantee that a reasonable set of truncated components can bring @xmath3 back within the bounds .",
    "the priors therefore include all models within a class , but do not necessarily exclude all models outside that class .",
    "our baseline dark energy model class is parametrized by the pc amplitudes , @xmath42 , and @xmath12 in a flat universe : @xmath43 the hubble constant , @xmath44 is a derived parameter in this representation .    in this baseline class",
    "we take the dark energy density to be constant at @xmath45 . the underlying assumption in this class is that by @xmath46 the dark energy is already much smaller than the matter density as in @xmath0cdm , and enforcing constant dark energy density at @xmath45 assures that it becomes increasingly irrelevant at higher redshift .",
    "note that our baseline model class includes the standard @xmath0cdm  model of a cosmological constant in a flat universe , corresponding to @xmath47 for @xmath25 .",
    "if observations falsify the baseline model class , we can generalize it by including both dark energy that remains a substantial fraction of the energy density at @xmath45 , dubbed `` early dark energy '' @xcite , and spatial curvature .    to describe early dark energy , we adopt a simple parametrization by assuming a constant equation of state , @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the dark energy density at @xmath45 can be extrapolated from its value at @xmath26 as @xmath49 this description notably accounts for , but is not limited to , scalar field models that  track \" at @xmath50 @xcite where the equation of state is determined by that of the dominant component , in this case matter ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we examine the limitations of this parametrization in appendix  [ app : complete ] . instead of @xmath52 , we use @xmath53 as the parameter for likelihood analysis since models with @xmath54 all have rapidly vanishing dark energy density at @xmath45 and are therefore degenerate with each other in all observables .",
    "we allow the early dark energy parameter to vary within the range @xmath55 , where the upper limit eliminates @xmath56 models with dark energy density that exceeds the matter density at early times .",
    "we restrict the allowed range for @xmath52 further in model classes where the low redshift equation of state is bounded ( see appendix  [ app : data ] for details ) .    note that components of dark matter that are smooth on small scales , for example very light neutrinos , are also described by the early dark energy parametrization .",
    "we will not distinguish between these two possibilities here as that would require measurements in a regime where either the neutrinos or the dark energy were not smooth .    to complete our most general model class , we allow for the possibility of spatial curvature , parametrized by @xmath57 .",
    "the full parametrization for a dark energy model class is therefore @xmath58 the present dark energy density @xmath7 is derived from this parameter set . setting @xmath59 and",

    "we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm to estimate the joint posterior distribution of cosmological parameters and derived observables by sampling the parameter space and evaluating the likelihood of each proposed model compared with an assumed data set ( e.g.  see  @xcite ) .",
    "the posterior distribution is obtained using bayes theorem , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the likelihood of the data @xmath63 given the model parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the prior probability density .",
    "the mcmc algorithm generates random draws from the posterior distribution that are fair samples of the likelihood surface .",
    "from these samples , we can estimate many properties of the posterior distribution including the mean values , covariance , and confidence intervals of both the basic set of parameters and derived parameters and observables .",
    "convergence of the set of random samples to a stationary distribution that approximates the joint posterior density @xmath66 requires a large number of independent samples .",
    "we use a minimum of four chains per model and determine when these chains have a sufficient number of samples for convergence by applying a conservative gelman - rubin criterion @xcite of @xmath67 .",

    "we assume that all of the fiducial data are consistent with a flat @xmath0cdm  model with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , given that this model fits current constraints well .",
    "we therefore do not consider here the potential for sn and cmb data to test this fiducial cosmology .",
    "it is , however , possible that these future measurements will falsify flat @xmath0cdm  by themselves , even before considering consistency with additional observables such as growth .",
    "we have checked that most of our qualitative conclusions do not change with allowed alterations of the model underlying the sn and cmb data , and we note exceptions in appendix  [ app : complete ] .    given a parametrization for a model class and the fiducial data , the mcmc posterior distribution then provides observable predictions for parameters and derived acceleration observables that can be used as consistency tests to attempt to falsify the whole model class .      in this section ,",
    "we define a set of redshift dependent observables that can be probed by future experiments .",
    "we focus on acceleration observables that can be simply computed from the expansion history , leaving for future study the detailed relation of these quantities to what is actually expected to be measured by specific planned experiments .",
    "we divide the observables into two categories . in",
    "the first are observables that we assume will be measured by a snap - like sample of supernovae and the planck satellite .",
    "these measurements constitute the data for mcmc likelihood analysis , from which we make predictions for the second category of observables in specific model classes .",
    "supernova observations constrain the distance modulus , or relative luminosity distance , between objects of different redshift in the sample .",
    "we take the sn data as a starting point since of the known methods for constraining the acceleration , it has the finest resolution in redshift and hence its principal components form the most complete set for providing testable predictions .",
    "supernovae have an additional advantage of being sensitive to low redshifts @xmath68 where dark energy dominates the energy budget and where other probes like bao and weak lensing do not have enough volume and distance , respectively , in order to strongly constrain dark energy .",

    "the latter will ultimately be limited by the measurement of the optical depth to reionization from cmb polarization due to the translation between the observed acoustic peak amplitude and the intrinsic fluctuations at recombination .    the logarithmic growth",

    "measurements of @xmath101 have been proposed as a way to test general relativity ; we examine this idea in the context of various classes of cosmological models in   [ sec : tree4 ] .    in this paper",
    ", we remain agnostic about the techniques that best probe these observables and simply assess the precision to which they can be predicted in certain model classes",
    ". however , some caveats are useful to keep in mind .",
    "although we make predictions as a function of redshift that can include fine - scale features , measurements will typically only constrain coarse - grained averages of the predictions over wide bands in redshift .",
    "for example , observations of the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) on galaxy clustering in directions transverse to the line of sight provide a standard ruler to constrain absolute distances @xmath71 , and bao measurements along the line of sight can constrain the expansion rate , @xmath70 . however , a volume of @xmath102  gpc@xmath103 is required to obtain accurate measurements of either quantity , resulting in smearing in redshift .    likewise ,",
    "weak lensing measures both the growth function and ratios of distances , but the broadness of the lensing kernel and scatter in photometric redshifts again prevents a purely local measurement .",
    "growth rate measurements that involve the redshift space distortion of galaxy surveys and galaxy bias information from lensing suffer from broadening from both data sets .",
    "growth and growth rate measurements from the cluster abundance or weak lensing in the nonlinear regime also involve integrals over the past history of growth and not merely the instantaneous linear growth @xcite .    finally , it is useful to place weak current priors on parameters related to the observables . in the broadest model classes that we consider ,",
    "the sn and cmb measurements alone are not sufficiently predictive to eliminate even highly deviant models . to ensure that we only include models that are not already ruled out by observations , we include priors on the fraction of dark energy at recombination @xmath104 from wmap @xcite , the absolute distance @xmath105 from current bao measurements from sdss @xcite , and the hubble constant @xmath106 from the hst key project @xcite .",
    "the former represents the impact of the change in the growth function near recombination on the first few acoustic peaks of the cmb .",
    "we conservatively do not include the expected improvement on this measurement from planck .",
    "the bao distance prior serves mainly to reduce the possible deviations from a flat geometry for dynamical dark energy models with spatial curvature .",
    "the role of the hubble constant prior in this analysis is to limit the variation in @xmath3 at very low redshifts as we describe in appendix  [ app : pcs ] .    in summary ,",
    "the observables that we predict are the expansion rate @xmath70 , comoving absolute distances @xmath71 , the growth history @xmath72 relative to recombination or @xmath107 relative to the present , and the growth rate @xmath73 .",
    "the redshift evolution of these quantities for the fiducial flat @xmath0cdm  model is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid ] .",
    "predictions from sn and cmb data are derived by constructing these observables from models in the mcmc samples described in   [ sec : mcmc ] , and we explore the implications for various dark energy model classes in   [ sec : dectree ] .      to make predictions that can reliably be used to falsify paradigms for dark energy , our parametrization must describe any effects that models within the class might have on observables .",
    "in particular , we must ensure that the set of principal components that parametrize variation in @xmath3 form a complete basis for representing changes in growth and expansion observables relative to the fiducial cosmology due to changes in the dark energy equation of state . in this section",
    "we summarize our criteria for completeness , and refer the reader to more detailed discussions of these issues in appendices  [ app : pcs ] and  [ app : complete ] .",
    "when computing the pcs from the fisher matrix for sn and cmb distances , we have a choice of whether to fix or marginalize over the parameters other than the binned @xmath3 .",
    "these decisions affect pc shapes due to degeneracies between @xmath3 and the other parameters .",
    "we choose to fix @xmath108 and @xmath52 , thereby including degeneracies with curvature and early dark energy among the well - measured pcs .",
    "we marginalize @xmath42 in the pc construction , thus reducing the completeness for representing sharp transitions in @xmath3 at @xmath109 as we describe in appendix  [ app : pcs ] .",
    "since these transitions are largely indistinguishable and limited mainly by the external hubble constant prior , completeness is not important here .",
    "we therefore choose in this instance to sacrifice completeness for efficiency in representing the well constrained redshift range .",
    "given the set of pcs , the next question is how many out of the full set of @xmath31 components we need to keep as parameters ( see   [ sec : pcs ] ) . note that neglecting even the high variance pcs can have large effects on the equation of state .",
    "however , since all of the observables contain integrals over @xmath3 the effects of these rapidly oscillating pcs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pcs ] ) tend to cancel out for the redshift dependent quantities of interest , especially the distance and growth observables .",
    "in general , the number of components necessary for completeness , @xmath110 , will be larger than the number of dark energy parameters that can be measured to some specified accuracy .",
    "we typically find that the predicted range of observables changes fractionally by less than a few percent between mcmc analyses with 10 and 15 pcs ( see appendix  [ app : complete ] ) .",
    "the agreement is somewhat worse for @xmath70 in some cases , but discrepancies occur mostly at @xmath111 where oscillations of @xmath70 about the fiducial model would be averaged out in bao measurements over wide bins in redshift .",
    "we conclude that @xmath112 is sufficient for completeness , but we present results from the larger set of 15 pcs to further reduce any remaining artifacts due to incompleteness .",
    "the completeness of the parametrization could in principle depend on the choice of fiducial model that we adopt to represent the true cosmology for future observations .",
    "we assume that the future sn and cmb data will be consistent with @xmath113 as is true of current measurements , and we examine an alternate choice of fiducial model in appendix  [ app : complete ] .",
    "completeness may also depend on the redshift range over which the pcs are defined , @xmath114 . the choice of @xmath26 influences the definition of early dark energy as well , since we ascribe any deviations from @xmath9 behavior at @xmath45 to early dark energy parametrized by constant @xmath115 .",
    "we find that choosing @xmath24 to match the redshift coverage of the fiducial sn data nicely balances between defining the pcs where cosmological data have significant support ( which argues for a lower @xmath26 ) and having the pcs be a complete representation for other observables ( arguing for a higher @xmath26 ) .",
    "additionally , our parameter @xmath52 is not intended to be a complete description of early dark energy but rather a means of monitoring its observable signatures .",
    "we present tests of both our choice of @xmath26 and the early dark energy parametrization in appendix  [ app : complete ] .",
    "0.25 cm [ fig : dectree ]    distance measurements from sne and constraints from the cmb make predictions for the acceleration observables described in   [ sec : observ ] that can be tested by future experiments .",
    "these predictions are made within the context of a paradigm for acceleration , e.g.  a cosmological constant .",
    "where the predictions are weak , the observables can be used to estimate parameters within the class , and where they are strong , precision measurements can potentially falsify the whole dark energy paradigm .    in the following sections , we step through the predictions for various dark energy model classes . guided by occam s razor and criteria for falsifiability",
    ", we begin with the simplest model that satisfies current constraints : flat @xmath0cdm . models of this type make the firmest predictions and are therefore easiest to falsify .",
    "the next simplest and most predictive model class is @xmath0cdm  with one additional parameter , spatial curvature .",
    "this more general class is particularly interesting in that falsification would rule out a cosmological constant .",
    "since @xmath0cdm  corresponds to a constant dark energy equation of state @xmath9 , our next step in generalizing the class of models is to allow @xmath8 to vary with redshift .",
    "we first consider a restricted range , @xmath10 , corresponding to the allowed values of the equation of state in quintessence models where a canonical scalar field is responsible for cosmic acceleration at late times ( e.g.  @xcite ) . within the quintessence class ,",
    "we study how the predictions change when early dark energy and nonzero curvature are added to the basic model .    instead of going directly from a cosmological constant to arbitrary equations of state , one could test several intermediate models along the way such as constant @xmath8 or the two - parameter model @xmath116 @xcite , and many authors have used this approach in analyzing cosmological data . here",
    ", however , we take the view that unless the dark energy falls into a well defined physical classification such as a cosmological constant or a canonical scalar field , there is no reason to define a particular functional form of @xmath3 as a class and not another .    for the final model class ,",
    "we allow @xmath8 to vary over a much wider range than in the case of quintessence but retain the requirement that dark energy is smooth compared with dark matter on scales associated with the measurements of growth . for example , non - canonical kinetic terms can lead to equations of state with @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "if such a field has a sound speed substantially below the speed of light , then the growth predictions presented here would only apply below its sound horizon @xcite .",
    "we allow an arbitrary but large range of the equation of state within @xmath118 of the fiducial @xmath9 , so @xmath119 .",
    "we limit the range of @xmath8 to enable the mcmc sampling to converge to the joint posterior distribution of the parameters more easily .",
    "this range is large enough to include extreme departures from @xmath0cdm  and quintessence models , particularly considering the conservative nature of our priors on pc amplitudes ( see appendix  [ app : data ] ) . as with the quintessence model class , for the more general class of smooth dark energy models",
    "we also examine the effects of early dark energy and curvature on predictions for observables .",
    "figure  [ fig : dectree ] shows a venn diagram representation of the model classes that we study .",
    "the @xmath0cdm  model class forms the innermost circle since it is a subset of all the other dark energy classes .",
    "quintessence occupies a larger portion of the model space since the equation of state is allowed to vary within the range @xmath10 , and models with even more general equations of state are contained within the outer `` smooth dark energy '' circle .",
    "the four quadrants of this diagram separate models that are either flat or have nonzero curvature and that either do or do not have a significant fraction of early dark energy . within each of the three model classes , an open circle marks the simplest type of model ( flat with no early dark energy ) , and arrows lead to other models within the class with additional degrees of freedom . since the requirement that @xmath9 at all times for @xmath0cdm   models implies that dark energy is always negligible at high redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fid ] ) , the @xmath0cdm  class has only two types of models instead of four .",

    "the plots we present in the following sections show the range of fractional deviations in observables relative to the fiducial flat @xmath0cdm  model that is allowed by the assumed sn and cmb data , based on the distribution of mcmc samples .",
    "we plot these predictions for various growth and expansion observables (   [ sec : observ ] ) at redshifts @xmath120 .",
    "any future measurements that fall outside the predicted range of values would falsify a model class .    since it is impractical to show the whole posterior distribution at a number of redshifts for several different observables , we plot only the 68% and 95% limits of the distributions and a single example model selected from the mcmc samples .",
    "the confidence limits are defined so that the probability ( i.e.  number of samples ) is equal at the upper and lower limits , with 68% ( or 95% ) of the samples between those limits .",
    "this definition corresponds to the `` minimum credible interval '' ( mci ) of ref .",
    "a useful property of these mci limits is that the confidence region includes the mode of the samples even when the distribution is strongly skewed .",

    "there are several notable features of quintessence predictions when compared with those in the @xmath0cdm  class of models .",

    "the second main difference due to curvature is that high redshift negative deviations in @xmath71 at @xmath155 are now allowed at the @xmath168 level .",
    "a small curvature affects the distance to recombination more than it does distances at lower redshift . in an open universe , @xmath69 becomes larger and therefore allows dark energy the freedom to compensate by introducing a constant shift down in @xmath139 and up in @xmath158 at @xmath111 .",
    "the allowed amplitude of the shift is limited by our bao prior at @xmath169 .",

    "even in the most general quintessence class , there are still a few firm , percent level predictions",

    "observations that violate these predictions would falsify the entire quintessence model class .",
    "falsification of quintessence would challenge many theories of dark energy and motivate consideration of more complicated models than single canonical scalar fields .",

    "this change enables a reduction of the dark energy density at @xmath111 from the fiducial @xmath9 model , which can compensate for and thereby allow a higher fraction of early dark energy while maintaining consistency with the cmb distance prior . since dark energy is the dominant component at late times , decreasing its density typically results in lower total density at low @xmath11 , which increases absolute distances there .",
    "the extra early dark energy suppresses the growth at @xmath45 , and the reduced dark energy density at low @xmath11 raises growth back up toward the fiducial model slightly by @xmath122 . comparing figs .",

    "these new observable deviations from flat @xmath0cdm   provide smoking - gun signatures of curvature and an equation of state beyond quintessence .    although some of the model classes examined so far allow growth relative to early times to be suppressed by @xmath179 or more compared with the fiducial flat @xmath0cdmmodel , none of the previous cases allow growth to be enhanced by more than @xmath180",
    ". however , models with weak bounds on @xmath3 and nonzero spatial curvature can have @xmath72 be as much as @xmath181 higher than the fiducial model at @xmath122 , as shown in figure  [ fig : zdist2_3 ] .",

    "both effects correspond to an enhancement of growth at @xmath184 that occurs in closed models ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "the reason why such models become viable when we abandon the @xmath10 prior is similar to the explanation for the differences in the early dark energy predictions of quintessence and smooth dark energy models . closed universes have smaller distances to recombination , so without some other means to increase the distance , the models with @xmath81 are inconsistent with the cmb distance prior for the fiducial cosmology .",
    "removing the quintessence bounds on @xmath3 allows for lower dark energy density ( with @xmath159 ) at low @xmath11 , which increases the total distance to last scattering and allows closed models to match the cmb constraints .",
    "the lower dark energy density at @xmath111 and resulting enhancement of distances are also reflected in the predictions for @xmath129 and @xmath128 in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist2_3 ] . having @xmath81 and @xmath186 lower than the fiducial value means that @xmath187 is higher than in the fiducial model , which also contributes to the additional growth of structure at low redshift .",

    "[ fig : zdist1_3 ] and therefore appear inconsistent with those predictions , despite the fact that the quintessence class is a subset of the more general smooth dark energy class .",
    "the reason for these discrepancies is that predictions in the non - flat cases with large variations in @xmath3 both above and below @xmath9 are so weak that the shapes of priors on the pc amplitudes become important in determining the extent of the confidence regions .",

    "when other parameters are marginalized to obtain the 1d posterior distribution for @xmath108 , or for one of the growth and expansion observables at some redshift , the result is a skewed distribution .",
    "the basic reason for this volume effect is that the dark energy density depends exponentially on @xmath3 , which is a linear combination of the pcs , so changes in @xmath40 at small @xmath189 have less effect on observables than changes at large @xmath189 . to test how much the observable predictions are affected by the priors , we use alternate priors that are flat in the contribution of each principal component to the dark energy density at @xmath26 relative to @xmath122 ( see appendix  [ app : data ] ) , @xmath190 , \\label{eq : flatrhoprior}\\ ] ] so that the total dark energy density at @xmath26 is @xmath191 $ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : flatrho1 ] shows that with this new prior , the predictions become more symmetric around the fiducial model and also allow models that are acceptable under the quintessence subclass .",
    "these @xmath192 shifts indicate that the predictions from cosmological data alone are so weak that the exact confidence region depends on arbitrary theoretical priors on the measure in dark energy model space .",
    "therefore , any measurement of these observables at a level of precision comparable to the predictions is interesting in the context of smooth dark energy with curvature regardless of the sign of the deviation from flat @xmath0cdm . at the same time",
    ", conclusive falsification of general smooth dark energy models with curvature would require much larger deviations where there are no models with good likelihood values .",

    "the volume effect is not a consequence of our particular parametrization of @xmath3 ; for example , there is a similar shift toward @xmath81 for non - flat dark energy models parametrized as @xmath116 when the priors are flat in @xmath194 and @xmath195 @xcite .    0.25 cm [ fig : zdist2_4 ]    0.25 cm [ fig : flatrho2 ]    using the priors that are flat in the pc amplitudes , the addition of early dark energy to smooth dark energy models with curvature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist2_4 ] ) appears to make little difference to the qualitative predictions , except in some of the 95% limits .",
    "however , much of the effect of early dark energy on these models is masked by the flat-@xmath40 pc prior . as fig .",

    "one lesson from the analysis in the previous section is that the combination of general variation in the dark energy equation of state with early dark energy and nonzero spatial curvature allow a wide variety of cosmological models to fit future sn and cmb data .",
    "falsification of the most general smooth dark energy model class therefore appears to be quite difficult , especially given the dependence of the growth and expansion observable predictions on priors that must be set arbitrarily in the absence of an underlying theory for dark energy .",
    "however , even these very general models make some firm predictions about the relations between observables that could potentially be falsified by future measurements .    one example of a robust prediction for the observables is the following : given the flat @xmath0cdm  model that matches the sn and cmb data and assuming that the dark energy always contributes positively to energy density , @xmath70 at @xmath198 can be no more than @xmath199 lower than in @xmath0cdm .",

    "fixing these additional parameters ensures that the pcs we use are as complete as possible in the acceleration observables , and so we fix @xmath108 and @xmath52 when computing the pcs .",
    "however , @xmath42 is an exception to this rule where having a fully complete basis for @xmath3 is not desirable .",
    "there are two types of degeneracy that can in principle exist between @xmath42 and @xmath3 in the assumed sn and cmb data .",
    "first , the dark energy can mimic some fraction of the matter density ( leaving @xmath311 unchanged ) by approaching @xmath51 at high @xmath11 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the context of a spatially flat geometry with no early dark energy , this degeneracy",
    "is eliminated by the cmb constraints on @xmath69 and @xmath12 .",
    "the impact of these constraints weakens if we allow for the freedom to adjust either curvature or early dark energy . by constructing pcs with curvature and early dark energy fixed",
    ", we assume that the matter - mimicking mode of @xmath3 can be measured by the sn distances and cmb constraints .",
    "this assumption ensures that the pcs are complete with respect to this mode , regardless of whether we marginalize or fix @xmath42 in the pc construction .",
    "this type of degeneracy between @xmath42 and @xmath3 is therefore properly included in the mcmc predictions for model classes with curvature and early dark energy .",
    "a second type of degeneracy is introduced by the minimum redshift for which sne can be measured in the hubble flow . the ability to determine @xmath311 from sn observations depends on how well we can anchor the relative distances to @xmath122 .",
    "as noted in appendix  [ app : data ] , marginalization over the nuisance parameter @xmath312 causes the sn observations to be insensitive to constant shifts in relative distances of the form @xmath313 we are not free to change @xmath311 at all redshifts since @xmath314 at low @xmath11 independent of the cosmology",
    ". however , it is possible ( if unlikely ) that a large variation in @xmath3 near @xmath122 changes the sn distances by a nearly constant factor at all redshifts except at @xmath315 , where @xmath316 is the minimum sn redshift . when including the cmb data this effect creates a degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath42 since the shift in eq .",
    "( [ eq : snshift ] ) requires changes in @xmath42 and @xmath106 to satisfy cmb constraints on @xmath69 and @xmath12 .",
    "if we fix @xmath42 when computing the pcs , then we assume that the behavior of @xmath3 at @xmath109 is well constrained and therefore large variations in the equation of state at low redshift are included in the low - variance pcs . instead , we choose to reduce the impact of this degenerate mode of @xmath3 by marginalizing @xmath42 in the pc construction .",
    "our basis for @xmath3 is therefore incomplete with respect to this mode , but there are several reasons for neglecting large variations in @xmath3 at @xmath109 .",
    "one benefit of this approach is that by reducing the degeneracy between @xmath42 and the pc amplitudes we improve convergence of mcmc samples ; in the presence of the full degeneracy , it is difficult to obtain well - converged chains even for the simplest class of models with pc - parametrized @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , apart from the hubble constant itself and the interpretation of sn data as measuring @xmath317 as opposed to @xmath318 , acceleration observables are not significantly affected by this degeneracy . finally , despite marginalizing @xmath42 when computing pcs we still retain enough of this degeneracy that predictions for the @xmath319 behavior of @xmath71 and @xmath70 is appropriately uncertain and limited by our prior on @xmath106 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist1_1 ] , for example .",
    "improving measurements of @xmath106 beyond the current level would further limit the possibility of these ultra - low redshift changes in @xmath8 .",
    "conversely , in the absence of such variation in @xmath3 , precision @xmath106 measurements play the same role as low redshift @xmath128 and @xmath129 measurements in all cases considered in the main paper .    in summary , when constructing the pcs we take priors that fix @xmath60 and @xmath59 but marginalize @xmath42 .",
    "we do not employ the additional current priors from bao distance to @xmath169 , hst key project measurement of @xmath106 , or wmap limits on early dark energy that are added to the likelihood analysis .",
    "when making predictions for general classes of models , we need to make sure that the parametrization we use has sufficient freedom to explore all types of effects that models can have on the acceleration observables . in this appendix we present several tests of the completeness of our parametrization .",
    "we begin by justifying the number of principal components of @xmath3 used in the mcmc likelihood analysis .",
    "we then examine the sensitivity of our results to the choices of fiducial model and maximum redshift for principal components .",
    "finally , we discuss the limitations of our early dark energy parametrization .",
    "the pcs form a complete basis for @xmath3 ordered by how well they can be measured by the fiducial sn and cmb data .",
    "this ordering allows us to truncate the set of pcs to some small number that have the greatest impact on the fiducial data .",
    "retaining a limited number of pcs is a practical necessity to make parameter estimation feasible , but we must make sure that the higher - variance pcs that we ignore do not make significant contributions to the expansion or growth observables predicted in the main paper .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we do not expect or demand completeness in unobservable quantities like @xmath3 itself ; the high - variance pcs that we neglect can have large effects on the equation of state , but since all of the observables contain integrals over @xmath3 the effects of these rapidly oscillating pcs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pcs ] ) tend to cancel out for the redshift - dependent quantities of interest .",
    "this is especially true for distances and integrated growth , each of which involves essentially two integrals of @xmath3 over redshift .",
    "completeness is more difficult to attain for observables with a single redshift integral such as the expansion rate and growth rate , but the practical requirement of a large volume for such observations makes any rapid evolution with redshift unobservable in practice .",
    "our basic strategy for determining the number of pcs required for completeness , @xmath110 , is to repeat the mcmc analysis for each class of models using varying numbers of pcs .",
    "as we increase the number of components of @xmath3 , we expect the resulting predictions for observables to eventually converge once we have reached the necessary number of pcs .",
    "this approach makes the value of @xmath110 to some extent dependent on what we assume about the data and the allowed models .",
    "for example , it may be that the @xmath320 component can have a significant effect on certain observables if its amplitude @xmath321 is unconstrained , but limits on this amplitude from the data and/or priors keep the impact of this eigenmode on the observables small .",
    "similarly , it is possible that the value of @xmath110 changes as we add the additional freedom of spatial curvature and early dark energy to the baseline model .    since our definition of completeness is based on the precision of predictions for a variety of acceleration observables , @xmath110 will generally differ from ( and be larger than ) the number of dark energy parameters that can be measured to some specified accuracy @xcite or the number of parameters required by the data in a bayesian model selection sense ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : comp1 ] shows a comparison of observable predictions for the baseline quintessence class ( @xmath60 , @xmath59 ) , using either 10 or 15 pcs .",
    "there is little difference between the two sets of predictions , suggesting that @xmath322 is sufficient for this model class .",
    "in contrast , predictions in this class using only 5 pcs are significantly tighter than those with 10 pcs .    including both curvature and early dark energy in the quintessence model class",
    "does not alter the agreement between the predictions for 10 and 15 pcs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] .",
    "there is slightly more variation in the limits on observables at @xmath45 , but we do not expect perfect completeness at high redshift anyway due to our simplistic early dark energy parametrization ( see below ) . even in our most general model class where we weaken the quintessence prior to @xmath119 while continuing to include curvature and early dark energy , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp3 ] , the predictions remain robust to increasing the number of pcs from 10 to 15 .",
    "these comparisons indicate that @xmath323 is sufficient for completeness in all model classes that we study here . in the main sections of this paper we present results from the larger , `` overcomplete '' set of 15 pcs .    in our predictions throughout this paper , we have assumed a particular flat @xmath0cdm   model both for pc construction and for creating the fiducial sn and cmb data for mcmc likelihoods .",
    "since the true cosmology could be somewhat different , we can ask how the predictions for observables would change had we assumed a different fiducial model . to test this dependence ,",
    "we have redone the mcmc analysis using fiducial cosmologies with various values of constant @xmath324 . for simulated sn and cmb data based on @xmath325 ( approximately the 68% upper limit of combined constraints on constant @xmath8 from wmap and current bao and sn data @xcite ) , the predictions for growth and expansion observables in the context of quintessence models with either curvature or early dark energy have similar uncertainties to those with a fiducial @xmath0cdm  cosmology ( figs .",
    "[ fig : zdist1_2 ] and  [ fig : zdist1_3 ] ) .",
    "the main effect of increasing @xmath282 is that it slightly weakens the impact of the quintessence @xmath9 barrier ; moving @xmath282 away from this barrier makes it possible to slightly reduce the dark energy density at @xmath111 from its fiducial level , and therefore the predictions for quintessence models include some features that were previously only allowed in the more general smooth dark energy class .",
    "for example , compared with the flat @xmath0cdm   growth history , flat quintessence models with early dark energy are allowed to have @xmath326 at 68% cl instead of @xmath327 , and curved quintessence models with no early dark energy can have @xmath328 at @xmath122 ( 68% cl ) where previously only downward variations in @xmath329 were possible in this class of models .",
    "the ability to falsify certain model classes therefore depends on how consistent future sn and cmb data sets are with the standard flat @xmath0cdm  cosmology ; any significant variation would be interesting in its own right and would make some changes to the model testing results presented here but not the methodology or the logic of the results themselves .    another technical issue related to completeness is whether our choice of @xmath24 affects the predictions for observables .",
    "this choice enters into both the definition of @xmath3 principal components as discussed in appendix  [ app : pcs ] and the likelihood for mcmc as the maximum redshift of the fiducial sn sample . to distinguish between the two ,",
    "let us call the maximum redshift for pcs @xmath330 and for the mcmc likelihood @xmath331 .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath330 also influences our definition of `` early dark energy '' by setting the minimum redshift at which @xmath115 .    if we keep @xmath332 but extend the pcs to @xmath333 ( assuming a flat sn distribution at @xmath334 with the number per bin equal to the number at @xmath335 in the original distribution ) , the resulting predictions for observables in the flat , no early dark energy quintessence class are similar to those in fig .  [",
    "fig : zdist1_1 ] .",
    "the predictions are slightly weaker , particularly at 95% cl , due to the extra freedom in @xmath3 at @xmath336 . the fact that width and redshift dependence of constraints on observables change little with increased",
    "@xmath330 indicates that our results are not strongly influenced by the choice of @xmath337 .",
    "for example , the tightening of constraints on @xmath91 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 at high @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist1_1 ] is more a consequence of the transition from accelerated expansion to deceleration at @xmath143 than it is of setting @xmath337 .    as another test of sensitivity to @xmath26",
    ", we set @xmath333 as before and also extend the sn distribution for the mcmc analysis to @xmath338 ( with constant number per bin at @xmath309 as for the pcs ) .",
    "the resulting predictions for flat quintessence without early dark energy are nearly identical at @xmath198 to the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist1_1 ] . at lower redshifts",
    ", observables are slightly better constrained due to the additional sn data ; the largest changes are at @xmath203 , with new 68% limits of @xmath339 and @xmath340 ( 68% cl ) .",
    "predictions for growth and expansion observables are relatively insensitive to increasing both @xmath330 and @xmath331 .    at redshifts above our default choice of @xmath24 ,",
    "we make predictions for observables by specifying @xmath341 through an early dark energy ansatz with a constant equation of state , @xmath115 .",
    "while @xmath52 is not a complete parameterization of early dark energy , it does provide guidance for predictions .",
    "for example , even though a constant equation of state at @xmath309 is a poor fit to the albrecht - skordis model in which a quintessence scalar field has an exponential potential modified by a quadratic polynomial @xcite , @xmath52 as an effective parameter can nevertheless simultaneously fit the cmb distance to the required planck precision and the growth function at @xmath26 to @xmath180 accuracy .",
    "the early dark energy parameterization acts as a diagnostic for whether the dark energy can ever become a substantial fraction of the energy density at @xmath155 given cmb constraints on the distance and energy densities at @xmath342 .",
    "our philosophy is to use an incomplete but representative parameterization that can be used to monitor the need for early dark energy .",
    "if a substantial fraction of early dark energy is required by observations under this parameterization , then more complete descriptions and more detailed observations will be required .",

    "<S> consistency relations between growth of structure and expansion history observables exist for any physical explanation of cosmic acceleration , be it a cosmological constant , scalar field quintessence , or a general component of dark energy that is smooth relative to dark matter on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> the high - quality supernova sample anticipated from an experiment like snap and cmb data expected from planck thus make strong predictions for growth and expansion observables that additional observations can test and potentially falsify . </S>",
    "<S> we perform an mcmc likelihood exploration of the strength of these consistency relations based on a complete parametrization of dark energy behavior by principal components . for @xmath0cdm , </S>",
    "<S> future sn and cmb data make percent level predictions for growth and expansion observables . for quintessence , many of the predictions are still at a level of a few percent with most of the additional freedom coming from curvature and early dark energy . while such freedom is limited for quintessence where phantom equations of state are forbidden , it is larger in the smooth dark energy class </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , even in this general class predictions relating growth measurements at different redshifts remain robust , although predictions for the instantaneous growth rate do not . </S>",
    "<S> finally , if observations falsify the whole smooth dark energy class , new paradigms for cosmic acceleration such as modified gravity or interacting dark matter and dark energy would be required . </S>"
