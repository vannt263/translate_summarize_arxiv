    "coherent states are instrumental in semiclassical descriptions of generic quantum systems and have proven to be a versatile tool in a plethora of physical problems .",
    "the most prominent types of coherent states @xcite are the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator , already investigated by schrdinger @xcite , and su(2 ) coherent states living in the hilbert space of a spin of general length @xmath0 @xcite .    in both cases",
    "the corresponding coherent states fulfill a list of wellknown properties which are the basis for their prominent role in semiclassics : ( i ) the coherent states can be generated by a group transformation from an appropriate reference state , ( ii ) they are ( over-)complete , and ( iii ) are eigenstates of simple operators generic to the system . moreover , ( iv ) they saturate uncertainty relations with respect to an obvious choice of variables , and ( v ) they show a coherent time evolution perfectly mimicking the classical limit under appropriate hamiltonians .",
    "recently the present author has argued that one can add to the above list very general results on the coherent expectation values of products of arbitrary operators @xcite . in particular , the leading - order contribution to the energy uncertainty was , for an arbitrary hamiltonian , found to be purely given by the time dependence of the classical variables , a both very intuitive and very general result .",
    "preliminary findings in this direction appeared also earlier and were obtained using concretely specified hamiltonians @xcite .",
