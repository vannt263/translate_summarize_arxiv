    "polytopes have finitely many faces , which are themselves polytopes .",
    "the boundary of the convex hull of a higher - dimensional algebraic set typically has infinitely many faces which lie in algebraic families .",
    "ranestad and sturmfels  @xcite described this boundary using projective duality and secant varieties . for a general space curve ,",
    "the boundary consists of finitely many two - dimensional faces supported on tritangent planes and a scroll of line segments , called the edge surface .",
    "these segments are stationary bisecants , which join two points of the curve whose tangents meet .",
    "we study convex hulls of the simplest non - trivial compact space curves , those which are the union of two circles lying in distinct planes .",
    "zero - dimensional faces of such a convex hull are extreme points on the circles .",
    "one - dimensional faces are stationary bisecants .",
    "it may have two - dimensional faces coming from the planes of the circles .",
    "it may have finitely many nonexposed faces , either points of one circle whose tangent meets the other circle , or certain tangent stationary bisecants .",
    "[ fig : firsttaste ] shows some of this diversity .    in the convex hull on the left ,",
    "the discs of both circles are faces , and every face is exposed . in the oloid in the middle , the discs lie in the interior , @xmath0 of each circle is extreme , and no endpoint of an arc is exposed . in the convex hull on the right , there are two nonexposed stationary bisecants lying on its two - dimensional face , which is the convex hull of one circle and the point where the other circle is tangent to the plane of the first .",
    "these objects have been studied before .",
    "paul schatz discovered and patented the oloid in 1929  @xcite , this is the convex hull of two congruent circles in orthogonal planes , each passing through the center of the other .",
    "it has found industrial uses  @xcite , and is a well - known toy .",
    "a curve in @xmath1 may roll along its edge surface .",
    "when rolling , the oloid develops its entire surface and has area equal to that of the sphere  @xcite with equator one of the circles of the oloid .",
    "other special cases of the convex hull of two circles have been studied from these perspectives  @xcite .",
    "this paper had its origins in subsection 4.1 of  @xcite , which claimed that the edge surface for a general pair of circles is composed of cylinders .",
    "our results show that this is only the case when the two circles either meet in two points or are mutually tangent  in all other cases , the edge surface has higher degree and it is an irrational surface of degree eight when the circles are disjoint in @xmath2 .",
    "this is related to problem  3 on convexity in  @xcite , on the convex hull of three ellipsoids in @xmath1 .",
    "an algorithm was presented in  @xcite ( see the video  @xcite ) , using projective duality .",
    "we sketch this in section  [ s : duality ] , and also apply duality to the convex hull of two circles .",
    "in section  [ s : background ] we recall some aspects of convexity and convex algebraic geometry , and show that the convex hull of two circles is the projection of a spectrahedron .",
    "we study the edge surface and the edge curve of stationary bisecants of complex conics @xmath3 in section  [ s : relaxation ] .",
    "we show that the edge curve is a reduced curve of bidegree @xmath4 in @xmath5 , and if @xmath6 and neither is tangent to the plane of the other , we show that the edge surface has degree eight .",
    "we also classify which curves of bidegree @xmath4 arise as edge curves to two conics .",
    "all possibilities occur , except a rational curve with a cusp singularity and a maximally reducible curve .",
    "in section  [ s : circles ] we classify the possible arrangements of two circles lying in different planes in terms that are relevant for their convex hulls .",
    "we determine the face lattice and the real edge curve of each type and show that these convex hulls are spectrahedra only when the circles lie on a quadratic cone .",

    "convex algebraic geometry is the marriage of classical convexity with real algebraic geometry .",
    "a real algebraic variety @xmath18 is an algebraic variety defined over @xmath19 . if @xmath18 is irreducible and contains a smooth real point , then its real points are zariski - dense in @xmath18 , so it is often no loss to consider only the real points .",
    "conversely , many aspects of a real algebraic variety are best understood in terms of its complex points .",
    "studying the complex algebraic geometry aspects of a question from real algebraic geometry is its _ algebraic relaxation_. this relaxation enables the use of powerful techniques from complex algebraic geometry to address the original question .",

    "images of spectrahedra under linear maps are _ spectrahedral shadows_. semidefinite programming provides efficient methods to optimize linear objective functions over spectrahedra and their shadows , and a fundamental question is to determine if a given convex semialgebraic set may be realized as a spectrahedron or as a spectrahedral shadow , and to give such a realization .",
    "scheiderer showed that the convex hull of a curve is a spectrahedral shadow  @xcite , and recently showed that there are many convex semialgebraic sets which are not spectrahedra or their shadows  @xcite .",
    "since the optimizer of a linear objective function lies in the boundary , convex algebraic geometry also seeks to understand the boundary of a convex semialgebraic set .",
    "this includes determining its faces and their inclusions , as well as the zariski closure of the boundary , called the _",
