    "for the sierpinski gasket of fig .",
    "[ gasket ] @xmath285 .",
    "as in the original work [ ] , we assume that there is a smallest level @xmath286 with the size of triangle equal to 1 .",
    "then , the size of the triangle of the largest level @xmath287 is @xmath288 and there are @xmath289 white triangles of the smallest level in it . the parameters @xmath130 and @xmath290 determine the hausdorff fractal dimension , i.e. the exponent @xmath71 that governs the scaling @xmath291 of the total area of white triangles as the size of the largest triangle @xmath26 increases .",
    "given that @xmath292 , one immediately finds that @xmath293        the wg random walk process can be viewed as jumps over the manifolds of centers of the full ( colored ) triangles each of them being determined by two numbers @xmath294 , where @xmath283 is the level of the triangle and @xmath295 enumerates in a certain way ( see fig .",
    "[ gasket ] ) all the @xmath296 triangles of the given level @xmath283 .",

    "what is the crucial invention of wegner and grossmann is the _ rate asymmetry _ parameter @xmath6 .",
    "it is this parameter that makes the up - jumps ( down - jumps ) a predominant process if @xmath300 .",
    "the _ rate scaling _",
    "parameter @xmath301 is natural on every hierarchical structure of the type fig .",
    "[ gasket ] in order to compensate for the increasing length of jumps as the level increases .",
    "the `` normal '' case is when @xmath302 . in this case",
    "the lvy flights can not occur . on the other hand , if @xmath303 and @xmath304 , _ all _ the moments @xmath305 ( @xmath306 ) of random walk displacement are divergent at all times .",
    "this is a somewhat pathological model .",
    "the presence of the rate asymmetry parameter allows one to reach new regime ( regime `` c '' in ref .",
    "[ ] ) at @xmath307 where @xmath303 but @xmath308 .",
    "it is exactly the regime where the density correlation function behaves similarly to that in the quantum case of random critical long - range hamiltonians of eq .",
    "( [ long - range ] ) .",
    "note that the case @xmath309 and @xmath310 would result in trapping of a random walker on a fractal with no restriction to the level number from below . indeed , in this case the bias towards down - jumps would drive the walker to lower and lower levels of hierarchy without a considerable displacement in the space .",
    "it is not the case in the wg model where the minimal level of hierarchy does exist , so after reaching it , the walker must go to the higher level with certainty and thereby may escape to arbitrary large distance .",
    "thus , the _ coarse - grained _ wg model _ never leads to localization _ but only to _ sub - diffusion _ : @xmath311 in eq .",
    "( [ sub - diffusion ] ) we introduced the _ walk dimension _ @xmath312 which is essentially the _ dynamical exponent _ that determines the relative scaling of space and time . in the wg model with @xmath313",

    "the definition eq([sub - diffusion ] ) is similar to the celebrated critical subdiffusion @xmath317 which is well - known from the scaling theory of anderson localization @xcite .",
    "this suggests that @xmath318 in ( [ sub - diffusion ] ) has the same meaning as the dimensionality of space in the quantum critical models .",
    "now we show that the wg random walk with the parameters @xmath301 and @xmath6 obeying eq .",
    "( [ param ] ) reproduces all the regimes shown in fig .",
    "[ levy ] .",
    "first of all , we note that , according to the table  3 of ref .  [ ] , the moments @xmath319 are divergent if @xmath320 which requires @xmath321 at @xmath322 ; here @xmath318 is given by eq .",
    "( [ walk - dim ] ) and @xmath48 is the @xmath48-coordinate of the displacement vector @xmath323 in the @xmath54-dimensional space in which the fractal is embedded .",
    "this suggests that the probability to find a walker at in an interval @xmath324 at a time @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath325 .",
    "switching to the radial - angle variables we find that the probability to find the walker at a distance interval @xmath326 within the solid angle interval @xmath327 is : @xmath328 in order to find the coefficient of proportionality in eq.([large - dist ] ) we use eq.(4.30 ) of ref .",
    "[ ] . then we obtain @xmath329 here @xmath330 and @xmath331 is the displacement in the ultra - metric space of levels expressed in terms of the radial displacement in the real space . at large enough @xmath258 and",

    "thus eq.([levy - weg ] ) , which describes the levy flights for the classical wg random walk , is isomorphic to eq.([pl - tail ] ) for the density correlation function in the quantum problem of random critical long - range hamiltonians , provided that : @xmath337 now consider small distances @xmath338 . at such distances eq.([levy - weg ] ) no longer applies . in order to find the density correlation function in this regime",
