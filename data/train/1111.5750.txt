    "social dynamics have been studied through statistical physics techniques in the last twenty years . among the studied problems",
    ", we can cite models of cultural @xcite , language @xcite and opinion dynamics @xcite ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "these kinds of models are interesting to physicists because they present order - disorder transitions , scaling and universality , among other typical features of physical systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied models of opinion dynamics in the last years is the sznajd model @xcite . the original sznajd model @xcite consists of a chain of sites with periodic boundary conditions where each site ( individual opinion ) could have two possible states ( opinions ) represented in the model by ising spins ( `` yes '' or `` no '' ) .",
    "a pair of parallel spins on sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 forces its two neighbors , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , to have the same orientation ( opinion ) , while for an antiparallel pair @xmath9 , the left neighbor ( @xmath7 ) takes the opinion of the spin @xmath6 and the right neighbor ( @xmath8 ) takes the opinion of the spin @xmath5 . in this first formulation of the model two types of steady states are always reached : complete consensus ( ferromagnetic state ) or stalemate ( anti - ferromagnetic state ) , in which every site has an opinion that is different from the opinion of its neighbors .",
    "however , the transient displays an interesting behavior , as pointed by stauffer et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a more interesting situation was studied in @xcite , where the model was defined on a @xmath10 square lattice .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered not a pair of neighbors , but a @xmath11 plaquette with four neighbors . considering that each plaquette convince its eight neighbors",
    "if all four center spins are parallel , and that the initial density of up spins is @xmath12 , the authors found that the system reaches the fixed points with all up or all down spins with equal probability .",
    "for @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) the system goes to a ferromagnetic state with all spins down ( up ) in all samples , which characterizes a phase transition at @xmath12 in the limit of large @xmath3 .",
    "this phase transition separates two distinct states of the system : for @xmath13 the system never reaches full - consensus states with all spins up , whereas for @xmath15 the consensus is always reached .",
    "other formulations of the two - dimensional model , considering for example memory @xcite , reputation @xcite , diffusion of agents @xcite or a random dilution of the lattice @xcite , also present similar phase transitions .",
    "the utility of the sznajd model goes beyond the basic description of a community @xcite .",
    "it was applied , for example , to politics . in 1999 , costa - filho et .",
    "@xcite showed that distribution of votes per candidate for the 1998 elections in brazil follow a power law with exponent @xmath16 .",
    "based on the sznajd model , two models with more than two opinions were proposed , considering the dynamics on square and cubic regular lattices , and also in complex barabsi networks @xcite .",
    "the authors successfully reproduced the distribution of the number of candidates according the number of votes they received in brazilian elections @xcite .",
    "the sznajd model was also applied to marketing , where it was considered advertising and a competition of two different products , and to finance , where the authors found a good agreement between some characteristics of the price trajectories ( like returns , for example ) and the simulations @xcite .",
    "it was also claimed that some other characteristic of sznajd - like models may also be present in real social systems , like the power - law relationship between the time need to reach the fixed point ( the complete consensus ) , called the relaxation time , and the system size @xcite .",
    "however , we can observe that the above - mentioned works did not take into account the effects of an external field in this phase transition . in a real community , external effects may be , for example , the mass - media influence .",
    "it is well - known that , in real life , the mass media ( television , radio , ... ) has a great influence in the population , and people tend to keep or change their opinions on any question according to that influence .",
    "these effects were considered in some social models , specially in the axelrod model of cultural diversity @xcite , and interesting results were found .",
    "thus , in this work we consider the effects of mass media in the opinion dynamics of the sznajd sociophysics model .",
    "this influence is introduced in the model by means of a probability @xmath0 of the agents to follow the media opinion .",
    "we performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for different lattice sizes , and our results suggest that the system undergoes a phase transition , as well as in the original sznajd model , for values of the probability @xmath17 , and that the relaxation times are log - normally distributed .",
    "in addition , the average relaxation times @xmath2 depend on the lattice size @xmath3 in a power - law form @xmath4 , where @xmath18 is a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the microscopic rules that define the model .",
    "the numerical results are discussed in section 3 , and our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "we have considered the sznajd model defined on a square lattice with linear size @xmath3 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the lattice sites were numbered by one index @xmath5 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total number of agents in the population .",
    "we assign an ising variable to each site , @xmath21 , representing the two possible opinions of each agent . at each time step , the following @xmath22 microscopic rules control our model ( see the schematic representation of fig . [ fig0 ] ) :    1 .",
    "we _ randomly _ choose a 2 @xmath23 2 plaquette of four neighbors .",
    "2 .   if all four center spins are parallel , the eight nearest neighbors are persuaded to follow the plaquette orientation .",
    "if not all four center spins are parallel , we consider the influence of mass media : each one of the eight neighbors follows , _ independently _ of the others , the media opinion with probability @xmath0 .",
    "notice that we update the agents states in a random sequential order ( asynchronous updating ) . after the above three steps",
    ", we count one mc step in our model . in addition",
    ", we will consider that the mass media is favorable to the opinion @xmath24 , i.e. , in the above - mentioned rule ( 3 ) , each neighbor ( independently of the others ) will change his opinion to @xmath24 with probability @xmath0 if he was not persuaded by the plaquette agents ( i.e. , if not all four plaquettes spins are parallel ) . in other words , we will take into account that the influence of a group of agents is stronger than the influence of media .",
    "in fact , we can imagine that in the real world people tend to be more influenced by friends , relatives and colleagues ( represented in the model by the plaquettes agents ) , among others , in comparison with the influence of the media ( represented in the model by the probability @xmath0 ) .",
    "notice that for @xmath25 we recover the standard sznajd model defined on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "as pointed by stauffer in @xcite , we can imagine that each agent in the sznajd model carries an opinion , that can either be @xmath24 or @xmath26 and that represents one of two possible opinions on any question .",
    "for example , in an election , the opinion @xmath24 may represent the intention of an individual to choose a certain candidate a , whereas the opinion @xmath26 may represent the intention to choose another candidate b. thus , the inclusion of the probability @xmath0 in the model will take into account the influence of tv and/or advertisement , for example , to provoke a change in the choice ( i.e. , the candidate ) of that individual .",

    "@xcite , if we consider an initial density of up spins @xmath12 and that a @xmath11 plaquette with all spins parallel persuades its eight neighbors , the system reaches the fixed points with all up or all down spins with equal probability . for @xmath13 ( @xmath14 )",
    "the system goes to a ferromagnetic state with all spins down ( up ) in all samples , which characterizes a phase transition at a critical value @xmath34 in the limit of large @xmath3 .",

    ", we observe that in some realizations of the dynamics the system reaches consensus with all spins up , even for @xmath13 . in the case of a greater value of @xmath0 , for example @xmath30",
    ", the difference between our model and the standard one @xcite is more pronounced , and a strong effect of the media influence is observed : even for a very small value of the initial density of up spins ( @xmath31 ) we observe that the full - consensus state with @xmath36 is obtained in some samples [ see fig . [ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "notice that as in the original 2d sznajd model @xcite , the system always reaches consensus states with all up or all down spins , i.e. , there are no states with magnetization per spin @xmath37 .",
    "however , the presence of an external field ( mass media ) changes the critical behavior of the 2d sznajd model .",

    "we have simulated the system for different lattice sizes @xmath3 and typical values of the probability @xmath0 , and we have measured the fraction of samples which show all spins up when the initial density of up spins @xmath39 is varied in the range @xmath47 .",

    "the exact threshold value @xmath52 above which the system does not present the phase transition is difficult to determine numerically .",

    "as above - discussed , we are interested in the transition between a phase where the full - consensus states with all spins pointing up never occur and a phase where this consensus always occurs . in this sense ,",

    "in this work , we have studied a modified version of the two - dimensional sznajd consensus model . in particular , we have introduced the effects of mass media on the opinion dynamics of the model .",

    "we have analyzed in detail the time evolution of the magnetization per spin for different values of the probability @xmath0 .",
    "the simulations suggest that the system undergoes a phase transition only for values of @xmath17 .",
    "this result was confirmed by measurements of the fraction of samples which show all spins up when the initial density of up spins @xmath39 is varied , that is the usual order parameter for the sznajd model .",
    "thus , the main effect of the probability @xmath0 , that acts in the model as a mass - media ( external ) influence , is to eliminate the phase transition .",
    "this behavior is similar to the effect of an external uniform magnetic field @xmath70 on the 2d ising model .",
    "the difference is that for the ising model any value @xmath71 provokes the destruction of the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition @xcite , whereas in our case it is necessary an `` external field '' @xmath72 to eliminate the phase transition of the 2d sznajd model .",
    "observe that the inclusion of simple ingredients modify drastically the behavior of the sznajd model .",
    "in fact , as discussed in the introduction , the one - dimensional sznajd model does not present a phase transition .",
    "however , the inclusion of a temperature provokes the appearance of a transition even in the 1d case @xcite .",
    "considering the two - dimensional model , the simplest formulation exhibits a phase transition @xcite , whereas the inclusion of an external field destroys this transition , as discussed in this work .    in order to measure the relaxation times of the model , we performed monte carlo simulations on square lattices with linear sizes up to @xmath41 and typically @xmath66 samples .",
    "as in the standard model @xcite , we found that the relaxation times are log - normally distributed .",
    "in addition , the average relaxation times @xmath2 could be characterized by power laws , @xmath4 , where @xmath18 depends on @xmath0 .",
    "based on the numerical values of @xmath18 , we found that the dependency is also a power law , @xmath69 , which implies that the average relaxation times decrease for increasing values of @xmath0 .",
