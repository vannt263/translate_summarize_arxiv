    "in the cold dark matter scenario , clusters of galaxies form through a succession of mergers of smaller subclusters and groups .",
    "major mergers can be the most energetic events in the universe since the big bang , with hydrodynamic shocks dissipating much of the kinetic energy of the collision ( @xmath3 ergs ) into the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the theoretical picture is supported by x - ray observations , which suggest that many clusters of galaxies are either undergoing mergers or have experienced merger events in the recent past .",
    "_ rosat _ observations generally focussed on distortion of the x - ray isophotes ( white , briel & henry 1993 ) and the presence of x - ray substructure ( forman & jones 1994 ; buote & tsai 1996 ) , while evidence for shocks in the icm was seen in temperature maps created from _ asca",
    "_ observations ( arnaud 1994 ) .",
    "the launch of and _ xmm - newton _ has provided a wealth of observational data , including high - resolution temperature maps of shocks in merging clusters ( markevich & vikhlinin 2001 ) and the surprising discovery of sharp surface brightness discontinuities between the hot cluster gas and moving `` cold fronts '' ( vikhlinin , markevitch & murray 2001 ) , which are thought to be the cores of subclusters which have survived the merger process ( markevitch 2000 ) .    modern cosmological simulations ( bertschinger 1998 and references therein ; see also frenk 1999 ) are capable of following the evolution of large volumes of the universe from early times until the present day , but are not particularly suited to modeling mergers as the resolution of individual clusters is limited unless techniques such as resimulation ( eke , navarro & frenk 1998 ) are used .",
    "cosmological simulations are also hard to analyse as the cluster does not necessarily have time to return to hydrostatic equilibrium between mergers , making it hard to separate one merger from the next .",
    "an alternative is to study the merger of idealized systems , which , while less realistic than the full cosmological approach , have a number of advantages .",
    "firstly , the objects participating in the merger are fully formed , and so there is no need to simulate the large volumes of space necessary to capture the evolution of a cluster of galaxies from high redshift .",
    "we can therefore use a smaller volume in which the merging systems are well resolved , and this also has implications for our hydrodynamic scheme ; this is discussed in section  [ sec : method ] . as we are studying a single merger event between two objects which are initially in hydrostatic equilibrium changes in the final object",
    "are easily quantified , and the controlled initial conditions allow parameter space to be explored . while full cosmological simulations are ultimately more realistic , the simplified picture represents the best chance of understanding the physics underlying the merger process .",
    "several authors have presented results from such simulations .",
    "head - on mergers between king - model clusters of unequal mass containing gas and dark matter were studied by roettiger , burns & loken ( 1993 ) and roettiger , loken & burns ( 1997 , hereafter rlb97 ) using a finite - difference code to model the hydrodynamics and an @xmath4-body code to model the evolution of the gravitational potential , while schindler & mller ( 1993 ) used a similar approach , although with less controlled initial conditions .",
    "however , these simulations treated the baryonic component as being massless , limiting the results to very gas - poor clusters .",
    "pearce , thomas & couchman ( 1994 , hereafter ptc94 ) examined head - on mergers of systems containing gas and dark matter using an adaptive particle - particle , particle - mesh ( ap@xmath0 m ; couchman 1991 ) code with the gas being modeled using smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; monaghan 1992 ) , with their results focusing mainly on the evolution of the core of the cluster rather than the observable properties of the merger .",
    "more recently roettiger , stone & mushotzky ( 1998 ) have used a hydrodynamic code based on the piecewise - parabolic method ( ppm ; collela & woodward 1984 ) coupled to a particle - mesh @xmath4-body code to examine the evolution of the cluster a754 , suggesting that its unusual x - ray morphology ( henry & briel 1995 ) is the result of a recent ( @xmath5gyr ) , slightly off - centre merger . ricker ( 1998 ) also used ppm to simulate off - centre cluster mergers , although these simulations do not include the dark matter which typically dominates the dynamics of clusters and can make a significant difference to the end state of the merger process ( ptc94 ; see also section  [ sec : struct ] ) .",
    "finally , takizawa ( 1999 ; 2000 ) carried out simulations of merging clusters using sph , with gravitational forces calculated using a tree algorithm ( barnes & hut 1986 ) .",
    "the simulations of ptc94 and takizawa ( 1999 ) are the most similar to our own and provide a useful comparison , although both were carried out at lower resolution than the results described here .    in this paper we present results from high - resolution ( 131072 particle ) simulations of the merger of idealized clusters of galaxies containing both dark matter and gas , using an ap@xmath0m+sph code .",
    "off - centre mergers and mergers between unequal - mass systems are also examined , with reference to the observable properties of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows ; in section  [ sec : method ] we describe our hydrodynamic scheme and the generation of initial conditions , while results are described in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the significance of the results are discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] , and conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     quantifying the effects of limited resolution is always important in numerical simulations . to assess the impact that resolution has on the results presented here , we have carried out two further simulations of head - on mergers between equal mass systems in which the total number of particles have been reduced by a factor of 4 ( run ) and 16 ( run ) , giving a total of 32768 and 8192 particles respectively , with the cluster properties kept constant by increasing the mass of the remaining particles .",
    "details of the simulation parameters are shown in table  [ tab : resol ] .",
    "@xmath6    the evolution of the clusters in the plane during these simulations is shown in figure  [ fig : convlxtx ] .",
    "the convergence between runs is good , with the evolution of the system being similar in all three simulations .",
    "the main effect of lowering the resolution is a systematic decrease in the luminosity of the merger remnant . in our low - resolution runs less energy is deposited in the halo gas than in the full runs and the core gas is shocked to a greater extent , leading to a broader , higher - entropy core in the final cluster , a result also seen in the resolution testing carried out in ptc94 .",
    "the differences in the emission - weighted temperature are small .    if the particle number is reduced further then the agreement between simulations worsens , and we would agree with the conclusions of ptc94 that 1000 gas particles per cluster represent a minimum for modelling the bulk properties of a merging system .",
    "however , more than @xmath7 gas particles per cluster are required to produce well - resolved temperature and x - ray surface brightness maps such as those shown in figures  [ fig : emho ] and  [ fig : emb5 ] , in agreement with steinmetz & mller ( 1993 ) .",
    "we conclude that the effects of resolution are of limited significance in our simulations .",
    "the evolution of the cluster in the plane has converged to a consistent result , differing only in detail as the resolution is increased .",
    "equally , we have sufficient resolution to follow the propagation of shocks in the icm acceptably , although here our resolution is closer to the minimum required for the problem .",
    "it is clear from the results presented here that mergers can alter the global properties of clusters of galaxies . during a merger ,",
    "hydrodynamic shocks dissipate much of the kinetic energy of the impact into the icm , leading to a departure from hydrostatic equilibrium that can last for several gyr .",
    "mergers lead to many potentially observable effects , including strong temperature gradients across shocks , distortion in the x - ray isophotes , multiple peaks in the x - ray surface brightness and high - velocity bulk flows in the icm . despite this , identifying merging clusters is not necessarily easy , as both projection effects and the limits of x - ray observations can serve to mask many of the signs of an ongoing merger . while x - ray substructure is clearly visible both before and after a merger when viewed perpendicular to the merger axis ( as can be seen in figures  [ fig : emho ] and  [ fig : emb5 ] ) , the x - ray isophotes appear spherically symmetric throughout the merger when viewed along the merger axis .",
    "equally , the shocks so apparent in temperature maps when viewed perpendicular to the merger are not obvious when viewed along the merger axis , with the cluster just appearing to have a steep temperature gradient as the cores of the two subclusters merge .",
    "while this departure from isothermality is itself a good indicator of a merger , it requires that the temperature profile is both sufficiently well resolved for it to be apparent and is not unduly affected by the effects of the merger , as the x - ray deprojection method ( arnaud 1988 ) assumes that the cluster is spherically - symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "temperature maps , derived directly from the x - ray hardness ratio , will therefore be a better indicator of an ongoing merger than deprojected temperature profiles .",
    "if the cluster is poorly resolved , it will simply appear to be well relaxed , hot and luminous , although evidence for a merger will still be seen in the distribution of the peculiar velocities of the galaxies in the two clusters , which can be expected to be significantly bimodal during a merger . at intermediate angles",
    ", projection effects will serve to smooth distortions in the x - ray isophotes and reduce the visibility of the merger in the x - ray waveband , although the effects are still apparent .",
    "the merging process has major implications for statistical studies of clusters . as we have shown in section  [ sec : lxtx ] , even relatively minor ( @xmath8 ) mergers can introduce a significant scatter in the observed relationship , while estimates of the mass of clusters based on the @xmath9 relationship ( horner 1999 ) will suffer large uncertainties during and immediately after a merger .",
    "mass estimates based on assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium ( fabricant , lecar & gorenstein 1980 ) will also be strongly affected as the departures from equilibrium can last for several gyr after the merger , during which time many of the readily - observed signs of the merger have faded , and roettiger ( 1996 ) estimate that errors in the mass estimate may reach 50% in the 2gyr following a merger .",
    "edge ( 1992 ) suggest that clusters will typically undergo a merger every 2 - 4gyr , similar to the timescale for our clusters to return to hydrostatic equilibrium , implying that truly relaxed clusters may be uncommon .",
    "the large increase in x - ray luminosity during a merger will also introduce strong selection effects into cluster surveys , and the clusters found at high redshift may not be a representative sample .",
    "the increases in x - ray luminosity and temperature during a major merger will strongly influence the statistics of the hottest and most luminous clusters of galaxies .",
    "this has been confirmed by temperature maps of two of the hottest clusters known , 1e 0657 - 56 ( tucker 1998 ) and a2163 ( david 1993 ; markevitch & vikhlinin 2001 ) , both of which show strong merger shocks .",
    "in addition , unusual clusters like a851 , which is cooler and less luminous than it s richness would suggest , may be undergoing the post - merger core expansion ( schindler & wambsganss 1996 ) .    the situation is more complex when cooling flow clusters are considered .",
    "we find that major mergers will almost certainly disrupt cooling flows to the extent that they can not restart within a hubble time , consistent with the lack of cooling flows in irregular clusters ( edge 1992 ) , but our unequal mass mergers have less of an effect on the cooling flow .",
    "a head - on merger still disturbed the cooling flow , although it restarted within a relatively short period , while an off - centre merger had little impact on the flow .",
    "the survival of the cooling flows during minor mergers is supported by a growing body of observations of cooling flow clusters that also show evidence for a late - stage merger ( a2142 ; markevitch 2000 ) , as well as merging clusters with small cooling flow cores ( a2065 ; markevitch 1999 ) which suggest that the cooling flow has been disturbed but has survived , at least until the present day .    finally , we examined the degree to which mergers can mix the icm . while the icm is never well - mixed globally , our simulations suggest that major off - centre mergers can efficiently mix the core gas , although there was very little mixing during a head - on merger .",
    "equal mass mergers will also disrupt any cooling flow in the cluster , and may explain why metallicity gradients are rare in clusters without a cooling flow ( irwin & bregman 2001 ) .",
    "the unequal mass merger introduced a high degree of mixing in the outer layers of the main cluster as the low - density gas in the subclump is rapidly stripped away , but had little effect on the core gas .",
    "a feature of unequal - mass mergers that we have not touched on in this paper is the survival of the cores of subclusters during mergers .",
    "sharp surface brightness discontinuities have been observed by in merging clusters of galaxies such as abell 2142 ( markevitch 2000 ) and abell 3667 ( vikhlinin 2001 ) , and it has been suggested that these features , termed `` cold fronts '' , are low - entropy gas from the core of a subcluster that had so far survived the merging process ( markevitch 2000 ) . we find that subcluster cores can survive off - centre mergers , and result in features very similar to those observed by ; this will be examined further in a subsequent paper .",
    "we have presented results from high - resolution ap@xmath0m+sph simulations of merging clusters of galaxies .",
    "our principle conclusions are ;    1 .   mergers lead to many potentially observable effects , including strong temperature gradients across shocks , distortion in the x - ray isophotes , multiple peaks in the x - ray surface brightness and high - velocity bulk flows in the icm .",
    "an increase in the entropy of the core gas during the merger leads to a broader , lower - density core in the post - merger cluster .",
    "in addition , off - centre mergers can give the core additional rotational support .",
    "3 .   the compression and shocking of the core gas during a merger can lead to large increases in the bolometric x - ray luminosity and the emission - weighted temperature of the cluster .",
    "this will have a significant impact on statistical studies of galaxy clusters .",
    "immediately after the cores of the subclusters interact , the core of the cluster undergoes a period of expansion driven by the collisionless dark matter , cooling adiabatically and decreasing in luminosity by more than an order of magnitude , before the cores turn around and recollapse .",
    "radiative cooling leads to an increase of @xmath10 in the x - ray luminosity during and after a merger when compared to simulations without cooling , even if central densities are relatively low ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) and the cooling times in the pre- and post - merger objects are greater than a hubble time .",
    "5 .   in a major merger",
    "the cluster can be out of hydrostatic equilibrium for several gyr , during which time the clear observational signs of a merger will become less apparent .",
    "brief departures from hydrostatic equilibrium were also seen in simulations of unequal mass mergers .",
    "cooling flows will be completely disrupted during major mergers , and are unlikely to be able to restart within a hubble time .",
    "however , minor mergers had less of an effect on a cooling flow , which was either unaffected by the merger or was able to restart rapidly .",
    "ram pressure is more effective at disturbing the cooling flow in minor mergers than the merger shock . during a merger",
    "the mass deposition rate inferred from observations is a poor estimate of the actual mass cooling out of the icm .",
    "major off - centre mergers effectively mixed the gas in clusters within a radius roughly equal to @xmath13 , the impact parameter .",
    "head on mergers and unequal - mass mergers had little effect .",
    "none of the mergers examined here effectively mixing the icm globally .",
