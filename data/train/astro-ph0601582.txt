    "surveys at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths have detected hundreds of galaxy candidates by their thermal dust emission .",
    "the galaxies ( hereafter referred to as submillimeter galaxies ) characteristically have redshifts @xmath9 and inferred luminosities of @xmath10 l@xmath5 and star formation rates of @xmath11 m@xmath5 per year ( assuming dust heating by young stars ) .",
    "such enormous luminosities and star formation rates , or accretion rates in the case of super - massive black hole growth , make submillimeter galaxies strong candidates for the progenitors of massive galaxies at the current epoch . clearly , it is crucial to characterize the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) where their emission peaks ( @xmath1 = 350 @xmath0 m for 40 k dust at a redshift of @xmath12 ) , measure their redshifts and luminosity functions , determine their power sources , and integrate them into theories of galaxy formation .",
    "although submillimeter galaxy seds peak at a few hundred microns for all but the highest redshifts , @xmath3 850 @xmath0 m surveys have been most successful at detecting galaxies because of the lower atmospheric noise and greater transmission , and less stringent telescope surface requirements .",
    "most of the detections have been low signal - to - noise ratio ( just over thresholds of 3 - 4 @xmath13 ) , necessitating multiwavelength confirmation .",
    "furthermore , the seds have been extrapolated shortward from 850 - 1200 @xmath0 m over the peak , or between 850 - 1200 @xmath0 m and the far - infrared , to estimate dust temperatures , luminosities , and star formation rates .",
    "clearly , 350 @xmath0 m photometry can confirm galaxy candidates and sample the seds near their peaks for more precise inferences of physical parameters .",
    "similarly , because of the difficulty in obtaining spectroscopic redshifts of large numbers of highly obscured galaxies , various photometric redshift estimation techniques have emerged , notably based on the far - infrared to radio luminosity relation in ulirgs @xcite and the stellar continuum bump in the infrared for _ spitzer_-detected galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , despite the difficulty , candidate spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for @xmath14 73 galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , with well - determined dust - emission seds , including 350 @xmath0 m , photometric techniques can be compared to spectroscopic redshifts .    in this paper , we present 350 @xmath0 m photometry of all 17 submillimeter galaxy candidates from the bolocam lockman hole survey @xcite , some with previous 850 @xmath0 m and 1200 @xmath0 m detections .",
    "two new galaxy candidates were serendipitously detected at 350 @xmath0 m , bringing the total number of 350 @xmath0m - discovered galaxies to three @xcite .",
    "we combine these data with infrared and radio data to derive improved luminosities , explore the range of implied dust temperatures and spectral indices , and compare photometric redshift techniques .",
    "this comparison is timely with the imminent launch of the _ herschel space observatory _",
    "( scheduled for august 2007 ) , which will detect thousands of galaxies at far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths , but for which spectroscopic redshifts will be attainable for only a small fraction . throughout the paper ,",
    "a cosmology of h@xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 = 0.7 is assumed .",
    "observations at multiple submillimeter wavelengths are vital both to confirm the bolocam sources ( as 6 false detections are expected from monte - carlo simulations ) and to make photometric redshift and temperature estimates .",
    "the 350 @xmath0 m sharc - ii observations combined with the bolocam 1.1 mm galaxy survey provides a flux density ratio that is strongly dependent on redshift for a given temperature .",
    "this is because the rest wavelength corresponding to the observed wavelength of 350 @xmath0 m with sharc - ii is near the peak of the grey - body spectrum ( for a @xmath19 galaxy at 40 k ) , and bolocam s 1.1 mm observations climb the steep @xmath20 ( @xmath21 @xmath22 1.5 ) modified rayleigh - jeans side of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "follow - up observations of each of the bolocam lockman hole galaxy candidates @xcite were taken with the submillimeter high angular resolution camera ( sharc ii ) at the caltech submillimeter observatory .",
    "the observations were taken on three observing runs : 2004 march - april , 2005 january , and 2005 february .",
    "the brightest bolocam sources ( 1 and 2 ) were observed over 8 hours of total integration time during the 2004 march - april run , although most of the run was lost due to poor weather .",
    "bolocam sources 1 and 16 were observed over 18 hours of integration time during the 2005 january run , again with much of the run lost due to poor weather .",
    "the 2005 february run was characterized by much better weather , and all the bolocam sources except for 1 , 5 , 8 and 16 were observed over 35 hours of integration time ranges and 75th percentiles of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , respectively . ] . when combined with the observations of bolocam sources 5 and 8 by @xcite ,",
    "the entire bolocam sample was observed over these observing runs .",
    "observations with sharc ii were taken in the point source observing mode , with a lissajous ( parametric sinusoidal curve ) scan pattern using the sweep command of telescope .",
    "the lissajous pattern was scanned in altitude and azimuth , with amplitudes of 30@xmath29 and 20@xmath29 , respectively . when combined with the 2.6@xmath30 @xmath6 1.0@xmath30 sharc ii field - of - view and 9@xmath29 fwhm instrument beam size , this resulted in a uniform coverage region of 95@xmath29 @xmath6 18@xmath29 , with a border of additional coverage ( 60@xmath29 @xmath6 40@xmath29 ) outside this region .",
    "each observation had a fixed length of 10 minutes to ensure uniform coverage even on individual scans .",

    "these spectra have the same redshift , cosmological dimming , and normalization corrections as in figure [ figure : revertzoom ] .",
    "while four of the five galaxies have closely correlated spectra in the submillimeter region of the spectrum , the infrared spectra ( _ spitzer _ 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m irac and 24 @xmath0 m mips observations ) exhibit a large degree of dispersion",
    ". this dispersion may be the result of several things : 1 ) because the spectra have been normalized to a t = 40 k ( @xmath44 ) spectrum at their 1.1 mm bolocam flux densities to account for intrinsic brightness variation between the galaxies , the normalization will result in an artificial reduction in the submillimeter flux density dispersions .",
    "this effect is not likely to dominate , as the flux density normalization has a @xmath14 10% effect on the flux densities of the galaxies .",
    "2 ) the _ spitzer _ detection associated with bolocam source 14 lies systematically low compared to the other three galaxies well - modeled by a t=40 k dust spectrum . while these _ spitzer _ observations @xcite are from a different data set than the remaining _ spitzer _ observations ( this work ) , it is unlikely that their flux densities are systematically uncertain by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "3 ) the 40 k dust temperature model of the submillimeter portion of the spectrum for bolocam sources 5 , 8 , 14 , and 16 assume a single dust temperature for each of the four sources",
    ". the temperature fit parameter is somewhat degenerate with other fit parameters , including the critical frequency , @xmath97 , where the optical depth of the dust is unity .",
    "thus , if bolocam source 14 has a lower characteristic dust temperature , then the infrared portion of the 40 k model will significantly overestimate the infrared flux density .",
    "@xcite estimates the temperature of bolocam source 14 to be 33 k from two photometric points ( 850 @xmath0 m scuba and 1.4 ghz vla radio observations ) and the dust sed templates of @xcite .",
    "this temperature uncertainty likely dominates our uncertainty in matching the infrared flux densities .",
    "4 ) in addition to heating by the ultraviolet and optical flux density from young stars associated with ongoing star formation , the thermal dust emission responsible for the bright submillimeter flux densities may be contributed to by an energetic agn .",
    "while not dominating the total bolometric output from the galaxy , they may have a non - negligible ( 20% ) contribution @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then the shape of the infrared continuum may be vary according to the relative contribution of star formation rates for these galaxies .",
    "5 ) another possible explanation for the larger dispersion in _ spitzer _",
    "infrared flux density as compared to our single dust temperature model may be from the fact that the infrared flux densities trace separate epochs of star formation within the galaxy .",
    "it is plausible that the dust heated by the ultraviolet and optical flux density from from current star formation is not well correlated to the current infrared flux density of older stars ( from previous star formation ) .",
    "furthermore , models of uv to millimeter emission of star clusters embedded in optically thick giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) suggest that the near - infrared to far - infrared portion of starburst galaxy seds vary considerably with age of the starburst @xcite .",
    "the composite sed ( including the radio points ) of the 5 bolocam sources with spectroscopic redshifts is shown in figure  [ figure : revert ] .",
    "two interesting observations can be made about the radio continuum emission associated with these galaxies : ( 1 ) the radio continuum is lower ( or the submillimeter continuum is higher ) on average than the well established radio - fir correlation for the local universe by yun , reddy , & condon ( 2001 , cf .  ",
    "[ subsection : discussion ] ) ; and ( 2 ) like the infrared flux densities , the 6 and 20 cm vla radio flux densities for the four galaxies with closely correlated spectra in the submillimeter region of the spectrum show a large degree of dispersion ( factor of 5 in 20 cm flux density ) .",
    "this scatter is much larger than the quoted uncertainties of the vla radio observations ( which constrain the 20 cm radio flux density of each galaxy to better than 20% ) this degree of dispersion is also larger than the factor of 3 scatter in the radio - fir correlation seen among the fir selected galaxies in the local universe .",
    "in fact , while the spectroscopic redshifts are similar for the four galaxies ( 2.1 @xmath111 3.0 ) , varying the 20 cm flux density over the observed range causes the best fit photometric redshifts of @xcite to vary from @xmath112 to 4.8 .",
    "this dispersion undoubtably contributes to the large errors of the photometric redshifts discussed in   [ section : photometric_redshifts ] .",
    "deep radio continuum imaging using the vla is a technically challenging task , and the disparate 20 cm flux densities by @xmath14 50% reported for bolocam sources 2 and 6 ( cf .  ",
    "[ section : summary ] ) exemplifies the difficulty of the photometry at radio wavelengths .",
    "most systematic noises in interferometry tend to suppress the brightness of astronomical sources , and part of the lower radio continuum flux density might be related to the imaging and photometry problems .",
    "it is important to note that due to the low s / n ratios at which the sources have been detected in the submillimeter wavebands ( @xmath113 for the vast majority of sharc , scuba , bolocam , and mambo detections ) , flux bias @xcite plays a major role in overestimating the flux densities at these wavelengths .",
    "while this factor indeed results in a systematic shift of the entire submillimeter portion of the spectrum to higher flux densities , it is unlikely that the magnitude of this effect ( @xmath14 20% for the bolocam flux densities ) could fully account for the lower than expected ( from the fir - radio correlation ) radio continuum flux densities .",
    "calibration errors may also contribute to a systematic overestimate of the submillimeter flux densities . finally , as two or more independent radio sources are found within the bolocam error circle in 8 out of 17 cases in figure 2 , source confusion or source blending",

    "this effect is demonstrated in figure [ figure : spitzer ] , in which models of local ulirgs arp 220 and mrk 231 systematically overestimate the radio flux densities of these submillimeter galaxies .",
    "higher quality data on a larger sample of high redshift systems are needed to examine the importance of inverse - compton loss and the possible breakdown in the radio - fir correlation .",
    "x - ray heating of the circum - nuclear gas and dust is an important source of luminosity in the far - ir if a luminous agn is present ( maloney , hollenbach , & tielens 1996 ) . radio - quiet agn fir emission could reduce the 1.4 ghz flux density with respect to the fir heating .",
