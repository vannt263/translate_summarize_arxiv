    "while far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity , as determined using the prescription described in lonsdale et al .",
    "( 1985 ) ] is often assumed to be a good indicator of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in extragalactic objects ( e.g. young & scoville 1991 , kennicutt 1998 ) , it has also been argued that , in the absence of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , x - ray emission could trace the sfr as well ; this latter assumption is based primarily on the observed correlation between x - ray luminosity ( usually in the 2 - 10kev energy range ) and fir luminosity initially found for nearby actively star - forming galaxies with sfrs @xmath13 - 30 @xmath2yr@xmath3 ( e.g. , ranalli et al . 2003 , grimm et al .",
    "2003 ; gilfanov et al .",
    "this relation appears to extend to objects with higher sfr ( up to 100 @xmath2yr@xmath3 ) and higher redshift ( e.g. , hornschemeier et al . 2005 ; persic & raphaeli 2007 , lehmer et al .",
    "2008 ) . the hard x - ray emission is generally assumed to have a power - law form and to be predominantly due to the collective emission of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , which are accreting compact objects ( neutron stars or black holes ) formed following the death of short - lived massive stars , and therefore expected to have a close relationship to the starburst .",
    "there have been , however , indications that objects with very high computed sfrs , such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , might depart from the correlation because they are underluminous in x - rays for their computed sfrs ( persic & raphaeli 2007 , barger , cowie & wang 2007 ) .",
    "arp  220 , the nearest ulirg , is a prime example , with a 2 - 10kev luminosity @xmath4dex below the general @xmath5-@xmath6 correlation ( see iwasawa et al .",
    "a further puzzle comes from its x - ray spectrum , which shows a strong high - ionization fek line ( mainly fexxv , iwasawa et al .",
    "this latter finding means that arp  220 is not only x - ray under - luminous , but that the hard x - ray emission is not primarily due to x - ray binaries because of the presence of a high - ionization fek line . in nearby star - forming galaxies , fexxv is much weaker ( e.g. , cappi et al 1999 ) or undetected , which is consistent that the hard x - ray emission is dominated by hmxbs .",
    "these peculiar properties of the nearest ulirgs clearly warrant further investigation with a larger sample of ( u)lirgs .",

    "the primary criterion was a flat x - ray spectrum , assessed by the x - ray color or hardness ratio ( hr ) .",

    "this threshold is chosen because ulirgs known to host agn ( mrk 231 , mrk 273 , ugc 5101 ) cluster just above this value .",
    "all of the optically identified agn are selected by this criterion .",
    "however , compton - thick agn are generally missed by this criterion because of their weakness in the hard band .",
    "therefore , objects that show a strong fek line at 6.4kev , a characteristic signature of a compton - thick agn , are also classified as agn ( ngc 6240 , ngc 3690 west , vv 340a ) .",

    "2004 ) and arp 220 ( iwasawa et al . 2005 ) , the line does not have sufficient counts in the chandra data for a significant detection ( see e.g. , clements et al .",

    "the fek complex generally consists of two components with distinct ionization states :  ( a ) cold fe at 6.4kev ; and  ( b ) highly ionized fexxv ( 6.7kev ) with a minor contribution from fexxvi ( 7.0kev ) .",
    "these two components can be separated well at the spectral resolution of the chandra acis - s .",
    "we define two spectral bands centered on the respective line components ( 6.35 - 6.55kev and 6.55 - 6.95kev ) , and five neighboring bands for the continuum , giving seven spectral bands over the range 4.25 - 7.65kev in the rest - frame .",

    "source counts recorded in seven bands corresponding to the pre - defined rest - frame bands were accumulated .",
    "the detector response curve was corrected by dividing by the mean effective area of each spectral band .",
    "as most sources have only a few counts over the energy range , stacking was done as a straight integration of individual sources , neither normalizing by the exposure time nor source brightness .",
    "the total source counts accumulated in the rest - frame 4.25 - 7.65kev band for the hxq sample are 296ct . the integrated spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "a strong fek line is immediately recognized with a @xmath29 excess .",
    "the line peaks at the high - ionization fek band ( 6.55 - 6.95 kev ) , indicating that the line is primarily due to fexxv from a highly ionized medium .",
    "the total counts collected in this line band is 35ct .",
    "there might also be a slight excess in the 6.4kev line band , which is however not significant .",
    "given the limited statistics , a further analysis beyond the line detection is not warranted .",
    "however , given our stacking method , which is biased for sources that are bright and/or with a long exposure , it is at least worth examining whether arp  220 and ngc  3690e , the two known fek emitters from their xmm - newton spectra , dominate the line detection .",
    "these two objects and the rest of the hxq sample were integrated separately , and their spectra are presented in fig .",
    "2b and 2c .",
    "both spectra show a @xmath30 excess in the fe xxv band with comparable line fluxes .",
    "this means that , besides arp  220 and ngc  3690e , there is a significant contribution by other galaxies to the detected line flux . the higher continuum level in the spectrum of the sample without arp  220 and ngc  3690e ( fig .",
    "2c ) suggests that some sources without strong fek emission are present , and that they may be dominated by hmxbs as found in nearby star - forming galaxies .    fitting a power - law to the continuum gives a photon index of @xmath31 , indicating a rather hard conitnuum above 4kev .",
    "the equivalent width of the excess in the fek band with respect to the power law continuum is @xmath32 kev .",
    "the 90% upper limit of the ew for a 6.4kev line is 120ev .    fitting a thermal spectrum ( mekal )",
    "gives a temperature of @xmath33kev and an fe metallicity consistent with the solar value .",
    "considering that the integrated spectrum is diluted by some sources that contribute only to the continuum emission ( see above ) , the fe metallicity of the line emitting sources is likely to be super - solar .",
    "regardless of the choice of spectral model , the strong high - ionization fek line is not compatible with the x - ray spectrum of known hmxbs .",
    "fek emission is often observed from hmxbs in our galaxy , but the major component is the cold line at 6.4kev and its ew is on average @xmath26200 - 300ev ( e.g. white et al .",
    "the much stronger , high - ionization line in the integrated spectrum of the hxq sample suggests that x - ray binaries are not the primary source of the 4 - 8kev emission .",
    "the general quietness of hard x - ray emission in the hxq galaxies ( fig .",
    "1 ) is likely related to the detection of the high - ionization fek feature , which rules out hmxbs as the primary origin of the faint hard x - ray emission .",
    "the powerful fir emission in the hxq ( u)lirgs predicts an abundance of hmxbs if star formation is the dominat power source .",
    "the chandra spectra , however , suggests these sources contribute little to the hard x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , either the bulk of the hmxbs are missing or they are heavily obscured from view .",
    "suppose heavy obscuration is the cause .",
    "since the fek band is still transparent to @xmath34@xmath35 @xmath36 , the obscuring column has to be larger , perhaps the order of @xmath37 @xmath36 .",
    "a dense , nuclear molecular disk ( with a dynamical mass of the order of @xmath38 ) is often found in the central part of ulirgs ( e.g. , bryant & scoville 1999 ) and thus , such a large column may not be unrealistic .",
    "the size of the nuclear molecular disk is generally found to be a few 100 pc but the densest part can be as small as 30 pc , as found by high - resolution studies of arp 220 ( downes & eckart 2007 , sakamoto et al .",
    "2008 , aalto et al .",
    "2009 ) , where a rough estimate of the density is @xmath39-@xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "according to grimm et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the number of hmxbs with @xmath42 ergs@xmath3 , which would dominate the integrated luminosity of the entire hmxb population , is @xmath43 yr@xmath3 ) . for @xmath44 yr@xmath3 , as estimated for arp 220 , the number is @xmath45 , and most of them need to be confined within 30pc in order for their radiation to be suppressed .",
    "the required stellar density is unusually high and could be a problem in this particular case .",
    "the other galaxies may have a larger starburst region and could avoid this problem provided the required mass of the obscuring gas does not exceed the dynamical mass .",
    "once the hmxbs are obscured from view , the fexxv spectrum can be explained by high - temperature ( @xmath46k ) , thermal gas produced by a starburst .",
    "possible sources are ( i ) an internally shocked hot bubble produced by thermalizing the energy of supernovae ( sne ) and stellar winds , as predicted by , e.g. , chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ) ; and ( ii ) collective luminous sne . the latter is ruled out if hmxbs are all embedded in heavy obscuration because the sne should also be embedded in the same obscuring material .",
    "the former would excavate the obscuration and become visible . with the assumed high sfr",
    ", the luminosity and the spectrum with strong fexxv can be reproduced ( e.g. , iwasawa et al .",
    "2005 for arp 220 ) .",
    "the diffuse hard x - ray emission seen in m  82 ( griffiths et al .",
    "2000 , strickland & heckman 2007 , ranalli et al . 2008 ) , after removing resolved x - ray binaries , has , in fact , a comparable x - ray to fir ratio with that of our goals hxq sample .",
    "the strong fe line is also well matched with the prediction for metal enriched gas of this origin .    with the presence of dense nuclear gas ,",
    "a heavily obscured agn is also a possible explanation for the x - ray spectra of our hxq sample .",
    "massive black holes in the process of rapid growth are naturally expected to be present in ( u)lirgs .",
    "when a central agn is deeply buried with a covering factor nearly unity , reprocessed light from the obscuring matter would have difficulty escaping .",
    "the high - ionization fek line could then originate from extended , low density gas which is photoionized by the agn . in a number of compton thick seyfert 2 galaxies , e.g. , ngc  1068 ,",
    "fexxv has been seen ( but normally weaker than the cold line at 6.4kev ) .",
    "this is in fact the feature originally predicted by krolik & kallman ( 1987 ) when assuming a likely scattering medium to produce the polarized broad - line region in ngc  1068 ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) . where the cold x - ray reflection is suppressed , the weak",
    ", highly photoionised gas could be the only observable feature .",
    "we note that fexxv has been observed as the primary fek feature in some compton - thick agn residing in the ulirgs iras f001837113 ( nandra & iwasawa 2007 , ruiz et al . 2007 ) , the superantennae ( braito et al . 2009 ) , and possibly ugc  5101 .    in arp 220 , recent measurements of a compact dust emission source with a steep temperature gradient in the western nucleus",
    "provides an argument for an agn ( downes & eckart 2007 , aalto et al .",
    "2009 ; but see sakamoto et al .",
    "millimeter wavelength molecular line observations also suggest the presence of x - ray dominated chemistry , which favors heating by agn ( aalto et al .",
    "2007 , imanishi et al . 2007",
    "; e.g. , meijerink & spaans 2005 for theory ) .",
    "the similarity of the x - ray properties suggests that the same explanation might apply for at least some of the goals hxq galaxies  i.e. , despite the lack of outward evidence of an agn , a significant fraction of the infrared output could be powered by a heavily obscured agn .",
