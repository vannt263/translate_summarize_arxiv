    "bright points ( bps ) are small - scale brightness enhancements located in the darker intergranular lanes . @xcite and @xcite were the first to describe these bps in filter images taken in the far line wings of h@xmath1 and caii  k , respectively .",
    "common models consider bps as radiative signatures of magnetic elements , which are often described by nearly vertical slender flux tubes or sheets @xcite .",
    "the increased magnetic pressure within the flux tube leads to its evacuation , and the lateral inflow of heat through the walls of the flux tube makes it hot and bright @xcite .",
    "consequently , bps are often used as tracers of magnetic elements .",
    "the contrast of bps relative to the average quiet - sun intensity is of interest since it provides insight into the structure and thermodynamics of magnetic elements .",
    "furthermore , the excess brightness of magnetic elements is an important contributor to variations of the total solar irradiance @xcite . in the visible ,",
    "the contrast of bps is particularly high in wavelength regions that are dominated by absorption bands of temperature - sensitive molecules such as ch and cn @xcite .",
    "we expect that their contrast is also large in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , but they have never been studied at wavelengths shorter than 388  nm .    in this work , we extend the study of bps , in particular their contrasts , to the uv spectral range down to 214  nm , using seeing - free images gathered by the balloon - borne 1-m aperture sunrise telescope .",
    "this is particularly important owing to the finding that irradiance changes below 400  nm produce over 60% of the variation of the total solar irradiance over the solar cycle @xcite .",
    "the spectral and total irradiance variations are caused by the variation of magnetic flux at the solar surface , in particular in the form of small - scale magnetic elements @xcite .",
    "the data employed here were acquired during the 2009 june stratospheric flight of sunrise .",
    "technical details of the telescope are described by @xcite .",
    "image stabilization , feature tracking , and correction of low - order wavefront aberrations were achieved by the gondola s pointing system in conjunction with a six - element shack@xmath2hartmann correlating wavefront sensor @xcite .",
    "observations in the near - ultraviolet spectral domain between 214  nm and 397  nm were acquired with the sunrise filter imager ( sufi ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "simultaneously , the full stokes magnetograph imax @xcite scanned the fei line at 525.02  nm ( land factor @xmath3 ) , hence providing kinematic and magnetic information .",
    "an overview of the collected data and a description of some of the observed phenomena is given by @xcite .",
    "we use three time series recorded from 00:36 to 00:59  ut , 01:31 to 02:00  ut , and 14:22 to 15:00  ut on 2009 june 9 . at these times , the telescope pointed to quiet regions close to the disk center .",
    "the sufi instrument recorded filtergrams centered at 397  nm ( caii  h ) , 388  nm ( cn ) , 312  nm , 300  nm , and 214  nm , while imax was operated in its standard vector spectropolarimeter mode , i.e. , full stokes observations at five wavelength points with six accumulations .",
    "the five wavelength points were set to @xmath4 and @xmath5  m  relative to the center of the line .",
    "a summary of the filter widths ( fwhm ) and exposure times can be found in table  [ exptimes ] .",
    "the effective exposure time of an imax continuum image was 6  s ( 6 accumulations @xmath6 4 modulation states @xmath6 250  ms ) , while dopplergrams need five wavelength points ; i.e. , their effective exposure time was 30  s ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",

    "the 214  nm data were only acquired during the third time series .",
    "the cadence of the imax data was always 33  s , while it was 12  s for the sufi data of the first two time series ( i.e. , all recorded sufi wavelengths within 12  s ) and it was 39  s for the last time series that included the 214  nm channel .",
    "the data were corrected for dark current and flat field .",
    "additionally , the instrumental polarization was removed from the imax data with the help of mueller matrices determined by pre - flight polarimetric calibrations .",
    "finally , the in - flight phase - diversity measurements ( permanently for sufi and intermittently for imax ) were used to correct the images for low - order wavefront aberrations @xcite .",
    "the phase - diversity reconstruction of the sufi images was done using averaged wavefront errors ( level-3 data , see * ? ? ?",
    "all intensity images were normalized to the intensity level of the mean quiet sun , @xmath7 , which was defined as the average of the whole image .",
    "the images were then re - sampled to the common plate scale of 0@xmath80207 pixel@xmath0 ( original plate scale of sufi s 300  nm images ) via bilinear interpolation , and the common field of view ( fov ) of 13@xmath638 was determined .",
    "residual noise was removed by applying a running boxcar filter of 3@xmath63 pixels .",
    "its width corresponds to about half of the spatial resolution of about 0@xmath815 reached by the considered observations ( determined from radially averaged power spectra ) . as a proxy of the longitudinal magnetic field , the circular polarization degree @xmath9 averaged over the four points in the line ( @xmath10  m ) ,",
    "@xmath11 was calculated with a reversed sign of the two red wavelength points ( @xmath12 $ ] ) to avoid cancellation .",
    "the line - of - sight ( los ) component of the velocity vector was obtained by a gaussian fit to the stokes  @xmath13 profiles .",
    "the velocity maps were corrected for the wavelength shift over the fov caused by the imax etalon , and a convective blueshift of 200  m  s@xmath0 was removed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "only one set of imax and sufi observations every five minutes was analyzed in order to allow bps to evolve between images . in total",
    ", we analyzed 19 image sets distributed over the three time series .",
    "bps were manually identified in the cn images at 388  nm , in order to be consistent with earlier work that concentrated on visible wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at each of the other wavelengths , we then determined the local brightness maximum in a 11@xmath611 pixel ( i.e. , 0@xmath822@xmath60@xmath822 ) environment of the detected bp position at 388  nm .",
    "this method takes into account that the various wavelengths represent different atmospheric layers ( most obvious for the caii  h images ) so that inclined magnetic features may appear at slightly different horizontal positions at different wavelengths . in total , we detected 398 bps , of which 211 were from the third time series including the 214  nm band .",
    "figure  [ figfiltergrams ] shows bps at 14:27:08 ut in a region of 10@xmath68 ( subregion of the 13@xmath638 full fov ) .",
    "the six upper panels display the five sufi filtergrams and the imax stokes  @xmath13 continuum image ( @xmath5  m ) .",
    "most of the bright features are visible in each filtergram . however , the contrast of these features at 525  nm is significantly lower than in the five shorter wavelengths .",
    "some features show a prominent brightness enhancement in the caii  h image but are of moderate brightness at the other wavelengths , e.g. , at position ( 8@xmath86 , 3@xmath88 ) .",
    "most remarkable is the high contrast of the bps at 214  nm , which strongly exceeds granulation brightness variations .",
    "it is this high contrast that lets the granulation appear relatively dark in the first panel of figure 1 , since the gray scales of all panels are adapted to the full min / max range .",
    "the bottom left panel shows the los component of the velocity . while the three bps at the positions ( 1@xmath80 , 1@xmath87 ) , ( 1@xmath88 , 0@xmath88 ) , and ( 2@xmath86 , 1@xmath83 ) show strong downflows of up to 2.5  km  s@xmath0 , most other bps exhibit only moderate velocities .",
    "the bottom right panel displays the mean circular polarization degree .",
    "most of the bps in the plotted region are associated with negative polarity .",
    "nonetheless , several bipolar regions can be seen , for instance the two neighboring bps at ( 2@xmath83 , 7@xmath83 ) and at ( 2@xmath86 , 7@xmath87 ) , respectively .",
    "histograms of the bp peak intensity relative to the mean quiet - sun intensity are displayed in figure  [ fighistograms ] as red lines in panels ( a)@xmath2(f ) .",
    "the blue lines correspond to the brightness histograms of the darkest pixel whose distance to a bp s brightest pixel is less than 0@xmath83 ( typical width of an intergranular lane ) .",
    "the text labels denote the mean values .",
    "the red histograms are largely symmetric , although there is a tendency for a tail toward higher contrast values , in particular at 214  nm and 397  nm . as already indicated in figure  [ figfiltergrams ] ,",
    "the largest average contrast is shown by bps in the 214  nm image .",
    "the highest peak brightness of 5.0  @xmath7 is also reached at this wavelength . at first sight",
    "it might be surprising that some bps are less bright than some of the pixels of the blue histograms .",
    "a closer look reveals , however , that all bps are indeed bright relative to the pixels in their immediate surroundings .",
    "for the caii  h line , the mean intensity of the darkest pixels in the bps vicinity is , with 1.07  @xmath7 , higher than for the other wavelengths , because the ca structures are generally more diffuse and larger than our limit of 0@xmath83 .",
    "the green curves give histograms of the normalized intensity for all pixels in all frames , practically representing the intensity distribution of quiet - sun granulation .",
    "a comparison of the maximum position of the red and green histograms clearly shows that the bps are much more conspicuous in the uv than in the visible spectral range .",
    "the quiet - sun histograms are more extended toward higher intensities than the histograms for the bp background , since the latter largely represents intergranular lanes .",
    "exceptions are the histograms for caii  h , which shows reverse granulation and those for 214  nm , where the comparable width indicates structures intermediate between reverse and normal granulation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "panel ( g ) of figure  [ fighistograms ] shows the los velocity histograms for the brightest bp pixels ( red ) , the darkest pixels of their vicinity ( blue ) , and for all pixels ( green ) . on average",
    ", the los velocity of the darkest pixels shows a downflow of 730  m  s@xmath0 , while the bps themselves are associated with a clearly weaker average downflow of 240  m  s@xmath0 .",
    "however , the broad wings of the distribution contain bps with significant upflows of up to @xmath14  km  s@xmath0 or downflows of up to 3.6  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "7.5% of the analyzed bps have upflows with @xmath15  km  s@xmath0 and 15% of the bps show downflows with @xmath16  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the red histogram ( bp velocities ) is located between the green histogram ( dominated by the large number of pixels showing upflows ) and the blue histogram ( mainly intergranular pixels showing downflows ) .",
    "our velocities are obtained from a gaussian fit to the stokes  @xmath13 profiles .",
    "the stokes  @xmath17 zero - crossings may possibly show different velocities if a bp is not spatially resolved .",
    "in contrast to the last panel of figure  [ figfiltergrams ] , where the signed net circular polarization was plotted , panel ( h ) of figure  [ fighistograms ] displays the histogram of the unsigned total polarization degree @xmath18 averaged over the four wavelength points in the fei line , @xmath19 this histogram is highly asymmetric .",
    "the polarization degree at the positions of the peak brightness reaches values of up to 9.1% , the mean value is 3.24% .",
    "such large values of the polarization in 525.02  nm suggest that at least some of the magnetic features have been resolved ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) . however , 4.3% of the bps are associated with @xmath20 .",
    "although the polarization degree in the darkest surrounding pixels is weaker , almost all of them still show a significant polarization degree of more than @xmath21 ( three times the noise level ) with the strongest value being 6.6% .",
    "polarization usually displays larger structures than the bps ( see the bottom right panel of figure  [ figfiltergrams ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can also be concluded from the fact that the blue histogram shows larger polarization values than the green histogram for all pixels .",
    "the mean values and their standard deviations for all red and blue histograms in figure  [ fighistograms ] are summarized in table  [ histvalues ] .",
    "columns labeled with bp refer to histograms of the bp peak value , while db denotes the histograms of the dark background .",
    "the standard deviation of the bp brightness is @xmath22 in all the sufi channels , except caii  h. this relationship can be used to estimate the brightness histogram width for other wavelengths .",
    "the rightmost column of the table shows the ratio of the bp contrast ( mean bp brightness value minus one ) to the rms intensity contrast ( taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* and calculated over the whole fov of the level-3 data ) .",
    "this contrast is a measure of how strongly bps stand out relative to the surrounding granulation ( or reversed granulation and waves in the case of 397  nm ) . according to table  [ histvalues ] , images at 214  nm show the bps most clearly .",

    "we identified 398 bps in simultaneously observed photometric and polarimetric sunrise images of a quiet - sun region close to the disk center .",
    "our data include three wavelengths in the near - uv in which the sun was never observed before at high spatial resolution .",
    "we determined the peak brightness and the brightness of the dark background of every detected bp at each observed wavelength .",
    "the bps peak intensity reaches up to 5.0 times the mean quiet - sun intensity @xmath7 at 214  nm .",
    "the mean peak intensity at that wavelength is 2.31  @xmath7 .",
    "the 214  nm wavelength also displays the largest ratio of bp contrast to the rms of the intensity over the whole fov ( see the rightmost column of table  [ histvalues ] ) .",
    "this ratio is a measure of how prominent bps are in an image at a particular wavelength .",
    "these values indicate that they are even more prominent at 214  nm than in the core of caii  h ( for the 0.18  nm wide filter employed by sufi ) .",
    "the value of the mean peak brightness at 388  nm ( 1.60  @xmath7 ) agrees exactly with the cn peak brightness obtained by @xcite from data recorded with the 1  m swedish solar telescope ( sst ) .",
    "examples of bp brightness values ( close to the disk center ) given in the literature for the frequently observed @xmath24-band at 430  nm ( ch molecule ) are 1.45  @xmath7 @xcite and 1.2  @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "both studies analyzed sst data .",
    "@xcite used @xmath24-band data from the 50  cm solar optical telescope onboard @xmath25 and found 1.3  @xmath7 .",
    "these values are comparable with what we find in the near - uv , with the exception of 214  nm , which displays distinctly higher values .",
    "note that the bp contrasts given in this study are not corrected for instrumental scattered light .",

    "the largest bp velocities reach @xmath14  km  s@xmath0 in upflows and 3.6  km  s@xmath0 in downflows .",
    "the mean value is 240  m  s@xmath0 , in good agreement with the average velocity of 260  m  s@xmath0 published by @xcite and reasonably consistent with the absence of stokes  @xmath17 zero - crossing shifts found by @xcite and @xcite in data with much lower spatial resolution . in contrast to this , @xcite reported a stronger mean downflow of 800  m  s@xmath0 as derived from the zero - crossing of their stokes  @xmath17 profiles and @xcite found a velocity range of @xmath265  km  s@xmath0 and a mean velocity of 500  m  s@xmath0 .",
    "the nature of the bps displaying strong up- or downflows in stokes  @xmath13 will be investigated in a subsequent study .",
    "the polarization degree , averaged over the four points within the fei line , is also calculated from the imax data and shows values up to 9.1% .",
    "the mean bp polarization degree is 3.24% , which is clearly above the mean signal of 1.40% for the dark vicinity .",
    "intriguingly , about 4% of the bps are associated with relatively weak magnetic flux ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this raises interesting questions , since enhanced temperatures and hence brightness in magnetic elements ( flux tubes ) is caused by evacuation , which in turn is proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , we would expect that bps show strong stokes  @xmath17 signals .",
    "significantly inclined magnetic fields can not explain the observed weak stokes  @xmath17 signals , because we also measured weak stokes  @xmath28 and @xmath29 signals .",
    "additionally , strongly evacuated flux tubes are strongly buoyant and hence should be nearly vertical @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a strong stokes  @xmath13 line weakening for kilo - gauss network patches due to temperature enhancements in the flux tubes .",
    "such an absorption weakening can also lead to a weak stokes  @xmath17 signal .",
    "although the network patches analyzed by @xcite are spatially resolved , we find many bps that exhibit complex stokes profiles , which is a clear indication that not all of the bps are spatially resolved .",
    "insufficient resolution can also contribute to weak stokes  @xmath17 signals .    in summary ,",
    "we find high intensity contrasts of bps in the near - uv range ( including the first measurements below 388  nm ) , with values up to 5  @xmath7 at 214  nm .",
    "the simultaneous spectropolarimetric measurements confirm the close association of bps with magnetic flux concentrations in intergranular downflow lanes .",
    "however , the majority of the bps exhibit only weak downflows .",
    "the reasonably high cadence of sunrise data ( between 4  s and 39  s , depending on the number of observed wavelengths and their exposure times ) and the high measured contrasts of bps make detailed future studies of the dynamical properties of bps very promising ( e.g. , s.  jafarzadeh et al . 2010 , in preparation ) . of considerable additional benefit for",
    "such studies will be the possibility to compare the dynamics at different layers in the solar atmosphere , which are covered by the combination of sufi and imax wavelength bands .",
