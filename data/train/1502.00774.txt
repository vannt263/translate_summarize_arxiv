    "we first measured the standard lab@xmath69 powders , with which we extracted the instrumental resolution .",
    "then we refined the collected x - ray powder patterns at 10 k with the obtained resolution using fullprof suite @xcite to extract the stain configurations as shown in fig .",
    "the existing afm - driven anisotropic strains conserve the lattice symmetry or may lead to possible nuclear structural domain changes , which , however , may be too small to be detected by the instrument accuracy .",
    "it is stressed that the lattice change in gdsi , e.g. , @xmath70 = 3.2(1 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 , is much smaller than that of the symmetry - broken afm metals such as srfe@xmath62as@xmath62 , where @xmath71 = 3.1(2 ) @xmath11 10@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "similar afm - driven strains were also observed in the classical 3__d _ _ chromium metal that also displays charge- and afm - spin - density waves @xcite .    * magnetization measurements , afm transitions and magnetic anisotropy . * to confirm that the positive to negative magnetoresistance ( mr ) transition is really induced by the shift of @xmath1 to low temperatures with applied magnetic fields , we exactly fixed the crystallographic _ a _ and _ c _ axes , taking advantage of the rotator , and measured the temperature - dependent magnetization as shown in fig .",
    "it is unexpected that the afm transition experiences two steps at @xmath26 and @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "s3a ) , respectively . from @xmath26 to @xmath38 , there is a slight decrease in magnetization , whereas below @xmath38 it first - order - like diminishes rapidly indicative of the formation of the long - range - ordered afm state .",
    "note that @xmath72 below @xmath38 transfers to @xmath73 between @xmath38 and @xmath26 , and subsequent to @xmath74 above @xmath26 , indicating the existence of magnetic anisotropy ( ma ) and different magnetic states in the three temperature regimes .",
    "the observed ma here is in agreement with the anomalous lattice constants ( fig .",
    "1a ) , the lower _ w _ values than 5 ( fig .",
    "2a ) , and the approximately zero paramagnetic curie temperatures as discussed below ( fig .",

    "we also measured the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath39 = _ m_/@xmath27__h _ _ along the _ a _ and _ c _ axes at 0.06 t in a temperature range of 3 - 300 k. the corresponding inverse susceptibility 1/@xmath39 is shown in fig .",

    "below @xmath0 100 k , @xmath82 upward deviates largely from the cw law , implying an increasing contribution of the _ afm _ spin correlations .",
    "it is pointed out that small upward deviation already appears at @xmath0 120 k consistent with the observed negative mr effect at 120 k as shown in figs 3b , 3e , 4b and 4d . however",
    ", this kind of small local afm spin states do not generate appreciable anomalies in the structural parameters until upon cooling to a temperature of @xmath0 100 k , where a sufficiently large magnetoelastic coupling that is able to shake the crystalline lattice may be just attained , as shown in fig .",
    "the occurrence of very small positive paramagnetic curie temperatures , @xmath76 , in the dominate afm matrix , indicates that either the 4__f _ _ moments in gdsi are purely localized without any interaction at all , or there exist mixed ferromagnetic ( fm ) and afm gd - gd interactions with an approximatively counterbalance of their strengths like the rare case in afm zncr@xmath62s@xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of fm and afm exchange interactions often causes spin frustrations .",

    "s4 may suggest a different magnetic state below 5 k with the one between 5 k and @xmath38 .",
    "a similar anomaly was also observed in ref .",
    "the fitting of the resistivity between 10 k and 40 k ( fig .",

    "<S> understanding the role of magnetism in manipulating mr may in turn steer the searching for new applicable mr materials . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that antiferromagnetic ( afm ) gdsi metal displays an anisotropic positive mr value ( pmrv ) , up to @xmath0 415% , accompanied by a large negative thermal volume expansion ( ntve ) . around @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the pmrv translates to negative , down to @xmath0 -10.5% . </S>",
    "<S> their theory - breaking magnetic - field dependencies [ pmrv : dominantly linear ; negative mr value ( nmrv ) : quadratic ] and the unusual ntve indicate that pmrv is induced by the formation of magnetic polarons in 5__d _ _ bands , whereas nmrv is possibly due to abated electron - spin scattering resulting from magnetic - field - aligned local 4__f _ _ spins . </S>",
    "<S> our results may open up a new avenue of searching for giant mr materials by suppressing the afm transition temperature , opposite the case in manganites , and provide a promising approach to novel magnetic and electric devices . *    utf8zhkai    magnetoresistance ( mr ) </S>",
    "<S> , a change in electrical resistivity when an external magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) applied , occurs in metals , inorganic and organic semiconductors , and particularly close to an intermediate regime of the transformations of charge ( insulator , metal ) order and spin [ paramagnetic ( pm ) , ferromagnetic ( fm ) ] order in thin manganites films as a colossal negative mr value ( nmrv ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the colossal mr ( cmr ) in manganites is accompanied by a shift of the transition temperature to a higher value by applied magnetic field so that a sharp peak appears in the mr values near the transition , e.g. , the nmrv reaches @xmath0 -95% at @xmath2 = 15 t near @xmath3 = 240 k in la@xmath4sr@xmath5mno@xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the double exchange interaction can qualitatively explain the cmr effect based only on the charge and spin degrees of freedom , the exact picture still remains elusive .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate here the intermetallic gdsi that crystallizes in the feb - type structure ( _ pnma _ ) and orders antiferromagnetically below @xmath0 55 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vanished orbital momentum ( _ l _ = 0 ) naturally removes the crystal electric field ( cef ) as well as its perturbation on magnetic interactions , which renders gdsi ideal for studying pure spin - magnetism - tuned transport . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , there keep solely two main sources for the magnetovolume ( mv ) effect . </S>",
    "<S> one contribution is from the volume dependence of the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) exchanges , which normally produces a negative mv ( nmv ) effect . </S>",
    "<S> the other is due to the spin - polarized itinerant moments in the conduction bands , resulting in a positive mv ( pmv ) effect . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the volume variation ( nmv or pmv ) with temperature in a magnetic state could be useful in determining the nature of its magnetic origin . even after nearly 50 years of research on gdsi @xcite , to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , there is little data on its temperature - dependent structural modifications and mr property . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on detailed temperature - dependent powder diffraction , angular - dependent magnetic characteristic and transport studies of gdsi single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we find anomalous anisotropic giant mr and spontaneous magnetostriction ( ms ) effects , in particular , an antiferromagnetic ( afm)-driven negative thermal volume expansion ( ntve ) and a nontrivial positive to negative mr transition , which can be well understood by combining the magnetic tunnel of conduction electrons and the concept of magnetic polarons @xcite , i.e. , local short - range fm spin regimes @xcite .    * results *    * structural studies . * the x - ray powder diffraction analysis ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) clearly shows three distinct structural regimes ( i , ii and iii ) . upon cooling , the refined ( re ) _ a _ , _ b _ , _ c _ and _ v _ shrink almost linearly before @xmath7 , followed by a slower decrease until sharp turns at @xmath8 , an onset temperature of the afm transition . below @xmath8 , the increases of _ a _ and _ b _ and the decrease of _ c _ ultimately result in an unusual ntve ( i.e. , pmv ) in the unit - cell volume _ v _ , which is quite useful in fabricating applicable materials with controlled thermal expansion values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> obviously broadening in the nuclear bragg peaks is present in the i regime ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s1b ) , which is attributed to the magnetoelastic effect ( the coupling between magnetic moments and lattice strains ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strain distribution patterns are extracted and shown in supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s2 . </S>",
    "<S> the variations in _ a _ , _ b _ , _ c _ and _ v _ below @xmath8 imply that magnetic anisotropy ( ma ) ( which is consistent with supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3a and uncommon for the _ s_-state gd - compounds ) , spontaneous pmv and anisotropic ms effects exist in gdsi .    </S>",
    "<S> the cef is mainly responsible for the giant ms effect in rare - earth ( re ) compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is thus expected to be negligible in gdsi . however , below @xmath7 , structural parameters shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a obviously deviate from the the oretical estimates ( solid lines ) by the gr@xmath9neisen ( gr ) law , e.g. , @xmath10 = 4.94(6 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 , @xmath13 = 8.24(9 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 and @xmath14 = -2.60(8 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 , denoting large anisotropic spontaneous ms effects . the formation of long - range - ordered ( lro ) afm state is a process of the growth of sublattice fm domains . </S>",
    "<S> the enlargement of fm domain volumes with decreasing temperature may accumulate strains on the domain walls , which is the microscopic mechanism for the magnetic - field - induced ms effect in ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , including the effect of the molecular field of one gd - afm - sublattice on the other is indispensable to understand the _ spontaneous _ ms effect in gdsi . according to the stoner model for itinerant magnetic electrons , </S>",
    "<S> the positive magnetic pressure @xmath15 associated with the magnetic ordering in a band is proportional to @xmath16 , where _ d _ , _ v _ and _ m _ represent the electronic density of states at the fermi energy , the volume and the magnetic moment , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the spontaneous pmv effect ( i.e. , ntve ) , e.g. , @xmath17 = 1.04(2 ) @xmath11 10@xmath18 , is therefore attributed mainly to the increases of _ d _ ( corresponding to the pronounced decrease of @xmath19 below @xmath1 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) and the induced itinerate spin - moments in conduction bands . </S>",
    "<S> similar ms and mv effects were also reported in gd@xmath6ni @xcite , where , however , they are ascribed to the itinerant character of the ni 3__d _ _ bands .    * resistivity measurements . * as depicted in fig . 2a , the zero - field - cooling ( zfc ) electrical resistivity at 0 t with current _ i _ along the _ a _ and _ c _ axes decreases linearly due to the weakened thermal excitations upon cooling until around @xmath1 ( vertical bar ) , where a hump with negative slop appears along only the _ </S>",

    "<S> this produces @xmath22 = 1.51(2 ) , @xmath23 = 1.56(4 ) , @xmath24 = 1.43(2 ) and @xmath25 = 1.51(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all _ w _ values are much smaller than 5 @xcite indicative of anisotropic magnetic interactions .    * anisotropic mr effect and positive mr value ( pmrv ) to nmrv transition . * </S>",
    "<S> the most intriguing results from resistivity measurements are the anisotropic mr effect ( figs 2b , 3 and 4 ) and the existence of both positive and negative mr values , up to @xmath0 415% ( comparable to the cmr value in manganites @xcite and one to two orders of magnitude larger than that of the re - metals @xcite ) and down to @xmath0 -10.5% along the _ c _ axis at 8 t and 3 k and 52.8 k , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the mr anisotropy in the _ ac _ and _ bc _ plans is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . they display a twofold symmetry at 7 k ( figs 3a and 3d ) . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that applied magnetic field of 8 t does not suppress ( produce ) the ( a ) hump along the _ c _ and _ a _ axes , respectively , near @xmath1 , and the mr twofold symmetry is persistent from 1 to 8 t , indicating that applied magnetic field in a strength of 8 t may just align or localize the 5__d _ _ moments , and slightly rotate and tilt the 4__f _ _ moments while conserving the superzone energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the mr effect in gdsi exhibits a well separate feature of the temperature regions for the positive and the negative mr values ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) , respectively , which is induced jointly by the afm superzone effect @xcite and the shift of the afm transition to lower temperatures in external applied magnetic field analogous to the case in manganites @xcite . for metals , </S>",
    "<S> mean - field theories predict that spin fluctuations induced by applied magnetic field from the localized magnetism produce a pmrv with the quadratic - field dependence in antiferromagnets , whereas a nmrv with the linear variation in ferromagnets and paramagnets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in gdsi , the pmrv in the afm state mainly displays a linear magnetic - field dependence ( figs 4a and 4c ) , while above @xmath26 the absolute nmrv is proportional to the square of the strength of applied magnetic field ( figs 4b and 4d ) . </S>",
    "<S> both the positive and negative mr effects do not saturate at utilized maximum @xmath27__h _ _ = 8 t ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the ratio of the resistivity at 160 k and 7 k in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a is already @xmath0 12 - 25 , therefore , the cyclotron motion of the conduction electrons could be neglected at @xmath2 = 8 t ( i.e. , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath30 is the life time of the conduction electrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these uncommon magnetic - field variations indicate new transport mechanisms for the mr effects of gdsi .    * discussion *    in gdsi , the conduction electrons ( mainly 5__d _ _ bands ) are different from those responsible for the magnetism ( 4__f _ _ component plus possible part of the 5__d _ _ component ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former is normally delocalized , acting as the magnetic glue among magnetic ions ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 ) , and scattered by them , leading to electrical resistance . the magnetism from the 4__f _ _ part is generally localized with weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the lro afm state originates mainly from the isotropic rkky interactions through conduction bands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between localized moments , @xmath31 , and itinerant ones , @xmath32 , can generate an extraordinarily large zeeman splitting in the mean - field approximation @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the spectroscopic splitting factors for the carriers , @xmath35 is the bohr magneton , _ j _ is the effective exchange coefficient and @xmath36 is the averaged local moment in the regime of band electrons . since @xmath32 is usually small , and the second term could be very large ( e.g. , amounting to fractions of an ev in the lro magnetic state of eu - compounds @xcite ) , in addition , _ j _ </S>",
    "<S> is strongly associated with applied magnetic field by virtue of modifying spin fluctuations of @xmath31 , the formation of magnetic polarons in the 5__d _ _ bands by this splitting in the lro afm state of gdsi is thus possible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when @xmath37 , the modified _ </S>",
    "<S> j _ at 8 t drives some of the conducting moments ( as foregoing remarks ) to form local magnetic polarons that lead to a largely degenerate conduction ( i.e. , pmrv ) ( figs 5a and 5b ) . in this case , the more extended 5__d _ _ bands almost certainly offer a small fm component , which dominates the linear - magnetic - field dependence below @xmath38 .    above @xmath26 , </S>",
    "<S> the lro afm 4__f _ _ moments disappear , which is implied by the change of the @xmath39 relationship between the _ a _ , _ b _ and _ c _ axes ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3a ) . however , the upward deviation of 1/@xmath39 from the curie - weiss law below @xmath7 ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 ) along with the concomitant anomalous volume lattice distortions ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) indicates that a kind of striking afm state exists there , which can be ascribed only to the local short - range afm 4__f _ _ moments ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5b ) according to equation ( 1 ) ( broad 5__d _ _ states indeed could not form a magnetic state by themselves ) . </S>",
    "<S> this local afm state theoretically @xcite leads to the quadratic - magnetic - field variation ( figs 4b and 4d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the local afm moments above @xmath26 are possibly oriented irregularly in the pm state and become compulsorily aligned and to some extent spin - tilted ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5e ) , leading to the decrease in resistivity and thereby promoting a nmrv .    including the contribution of magnetic polarons into the mean - field approximation of the mr effect of afm metals @xcite , the mr value ( mrv ) then equals @xmath40 where _ a _ is a constant , @xmath41 is the induced local magnetization by applied magnetic field , @xmath2 , @xmath42 is the angle between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the magnetic susceptibility of the 4__f _ _ site along the afm sublattice direction . at @xmath47 , neglecting @xmath48 , @xmath49 , resulting in a quadric - magnetic - field dependence . at @xmath37 , in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the linear part in equation ( 2 ) is dominate , i.e. , pmrv @xmath50 , which produces not only the linear - magnetic - field dependence but also the twofold mr symmetry ( figs 3a and 3d ) . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative analysis requires the knowledge of the exact directions of @xmath46 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the involvement of magnetic polarons in understanding the mr effects here is further supported by the existence of strong fm gd - gd interactions ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> re 4__f _ _ electrons generally remain localized so that their properties in an alloy closely resemble those in the single - elemental metals . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore interesting to compare the microscopic conducting mechanism of gdsi with that of the 3__d _ _ transition metals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , the 4__f _ _ shells highly screened by the 5__s _ _ and 5__p _ _ states are better shielded than the transition metal ( tm ) 3__d _ _ ones . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the 4__f _ _ electrons are well embedded within the atom and the 5__d _ _ and 6__s _ _ states act as conduction electrons in the metals , though band structure calculations suggested that the upper part of the 4__f _ _ spin minority may hybridize with the unoccupied 5__d _ _ and 6__s _ _ bands @xcite . on the contrary , for 3__d _ _ tms , the conductivity are mainly dominated by the _ s_-_s _ and _ d_-_d _ transitions at low temperatures , in addition to the _ s_-_d _ transitions ( increasing the effective electron mass and shortening the mean free path ) at high temperatures @xcite , supposing that both _ s _ and _ d _ electrons are conduction electrons . since almost all re 4__f _ _ metals and only some of the 3__d _ _ tms ( fe , co , ni and mn ) order magnetically at low temperatures , magnetism plays a more crucial role in controlling electrical property of re 4__f _ _ metals .    in summary , gdsi displays a wide array of novel behaviors including a two - step afm transition , an anisotropic spontaneous ms effect , magnetostrictive strains , in particular , an exotic ntve ( spontaneous pmv ) and a peculiar positive to negative mr transition , indicating a strong coupling between spin , lattice and charge degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiar pmrv to nmrv transition and their nontrivial @xcite magnetic - field dependencies are predominated by the nature of the 4__f _ _ moments and the polaronic 5__d _ _ carriers . </S>",
    "<S> coexistence of these extraordinary behaviors in the same gd - compound is unique . </S>",
    "<S> the present results make gdsi an fascinating system for theoretical and further experimental explorations .    </S>",
    "<S> * methods *    since the neutral gd is a strong thermal neutron absorber , we therefore performed a powder x - ray diffraction study of the pulverized gdsi single crystal on an in - house diffractometer employing the copper @xmath51 = 1.5406(9 ) @xmath52 as the radiation with a 2@xmath53 step size of 0.005@xmath54 from 10 to 300 k to explore the temperature - dependent structural modifications . </S>",
