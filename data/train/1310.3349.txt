    "the agns in the central cd galaxies of clusters sometimes show violent activities .",
    "such examples are ms 0735.6@xmath77421 @xcite , hercules  a @xcite , and hydra  a @xcite . in these clusters , cluster - scale shock waves",
    "have been observed , which indicates that the central agns ejected enormous energy ( @xmath8@xmath9  erg ) in a short time ( @xmath10  yr ) . the intracluster medium ( icm ) of these clusters",
    "should have been strongly affected by the agn activities .",
    "it seems that bondi accretion from hot gas is not sufficient and fueling of cold gas is required for the most powerful feedback from agns @xcite .    the cd galaxy of the hydra  a cluster has been studied by many researchers .",
    "it harbors a well known radio source classified as a fanaroff - riley type - i ( fr - i ) source .",
    "a pair of jets is ejected from the agn ( 3c  218 ; @xcite ) , and the huge amount of cosmic - rays contained in the jets may be stably heating the cool core of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the mass of the central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is estimated to be @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "although the galaxy is an elliptical , star formation activities ( @xmath12 ) have been discovered within @xmath13  kpc from the center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this may mean that some amount of gas is cooling in the galaxy , although the existence of a massive cooling flow has been denied with the asca satellite @xcite .",
    "previous observations have indicated that there is a disk - like structure in the galaxy . in the @xmath14-band ,",
    "the surface brightness profile is elongated at the galaxy center @xcite .",
    "observations of optical emission - lines ( [ oiii ] , h@xmath15 , and h@xmath16 ) show that the galaxy has a rotating component with a velocity of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "h absorption is seen toward the agn and can be interpreted as a disk @xcite .",
    "however , the morphology of the disk has not been well understood .",
    "this is mainly because the cluster is relatively distant ( @xmath18 ) and the angular resolution of @xmath19 is required to resolve fine structures .    in this letter",
    ", we present a subaru @xmath1-band image of the cd galaxy of the hydra a cluster with a superb spatial resolution .",
    "we show that the galaxy has a spectacular dust lane . throughout this letter",
    ", we adopt cosmological parameters of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "we use a redshift for the hydra  a cluster of 0.054878 , which gives a scale of @xmath23  kpc per arcsec . the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance to hydra a",
    "are @xmath24  mpc and 245  mpc , respectively .",
    "we observed hydra a with the prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; @xcite ) on the subaru telescope in hawaii on january 7 , 2013 .",
    "we use the standard pipeline reduction software for suprime - cam , sdfred @xcite , for flat - fielding , instrumental distortion correction , differential refraction , psf matching , and sky subtraction and stacking .",
    "the seeing was @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath1-band image of the cd galaxy is shown in figure  [ fig : img]a . a dust lane ( dark band )",
    "can be clearly seen in the central region of the cd galaxy .",
    "the size of the lane is @xmath26 ( 4  kpc@xmath270.8  kpc ) .",
    "the position angle of the minor axis is @xmath28 from the north to the east .",
    "we fit the galaxy image with a seric profile using galfit @xcite , taking psf size into account . the residual from the best - fits is shown in figure  [ fig : img]b .",
    "the position angle of the minor axis of the seric profile is @xmath29 , which is close to the result by @xcite for the @xmath30-band image ( @xmath31 ) , but is not parallel to the minor axis of the disk ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this may indicate that the disk formed after the overall structures of the cd galaxy had formed .",
    "the extinction is most effective at the center ( 40% ) , and it is @xmath32 . since the extinction curves of elliptical galaxies are not much different from the one for the milky - way @xcite , we adopt the galactic conversion factor ( @xmath33 ; @xcite ) and obtain @xmath34 and the column density of @xmath35 from @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is almost the same as hi absorption ( @xmath38 ) obtained by @xcite .",
    "if the gas is distributed as a uniform disk with a radius of @xmath39  kpc and a height of @xmath40  kpc , the disk mass is @xmath41 .",
    "figure  [ fig : radio ] shows the relation of the galaxy to the radio source .",
    "a pair of jets emerges with a position angle of @xmath42 and is almost parallel to the minor axis of the dust lane .",
    "the jet - dust lane configuration is quite similar to that of centaurus  a.    ( 80mm,80mm)fig1.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)fig2.eps",
    "we have checked x - ray data obtained with the chandra x - ray telescope .",
    "hydra a has been observed with chandra for total 250  ksec .",
    "figure  [ fig : ximg ] shows the exposure - corrected x - ray image of chandra acis - s for 200  ksec data in the 0.55  kev band . while the central agn is prominent , the disk - structure is not seen in the figure .",
    "x - ray spectral analysis for chandra acis - s and acis - i data of the total of 250  ksec was performed to constrain an absorption by the disk with response files appropriate for each observation in the 0.47.0 kev band .",
    "we study the spectrum of a @xmath43 region of the disk ( region `` d '' in figure  [ fig : ximg ] ) .",
    "we exclude the nuclear region `` n '' , because the emission from it can be affected by the absorption in the vicinity of the smbh . in fact , we find that the absorption associated with the agn is @xmath44 , which is consistent with the previous result ( @xmath45 @xcite . owing to the finite size of pixels ( @xmath46 ) , the pixels we used actually cover the optical disk ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "first , we extract a spectrum within a @xmath48 circle centered on the agn excluding the agn and disk regions ( `` n '' and `` d '' ) in order to estimate the fore- and/or background emissions .",
    "the spectrum is represented by two - temperature ( cd galaxy + icm ) thermal models ( apec ) with a common metal abundance multiplied by absorption ( phabs ) : @xmath49 .",
    "the results are @xmath50 and @xmath51 kev with 0.7@xmath52 solar abundance , and @xmath53  @xmath54 ( errors of 90% confidence ) .",
    "the absorption value is almost consistent with the galactic absorption ( @xmath55  @xmath54 , @xcite ) in the direction of hydra a. fixing these fore- and/or background parameters , we investigate the upper limit of the absorption by the disk . here , we assume that the emission from the disk region is represented by two - temperature thermal models ( cd galaxy + icm ) and only the cooler component ( cd galaxy ) is absorbed by the disk : @xmath56 .",
    "we employ an increment of @xmath57 as the measure for the 90% upper limit of the absorption .",
    "we find that the upper limit is @xmath58  @xmath54 , which is consistent with the disk absorption of @xmath35 ( section  [ sec : result ] ) .",
    "note that the absorption by the dust lane on the both sides of the agn should be smaller than that in the direction of the agn ( region `` n '' ) .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig3.eps      optical emission - lines have been discovered from the cd galaxy of hydra  a. if the rotation of the emission - line component corresponds to that of the dust lane , the rotation velocity is @xmath59 @xcite , which gives the rotation period of @xmath60  yr .",
    "the age of the cold disk should be larger than this period . from the observations of a shock wave in the icm",
    ", @xcite indicated that there was a strong outburst of the agn with an energy of @xmath8  erg @xmath61  yrs ago .",
    "this outburst may be related to the formation of the disk .",
    "note that if all the disk gas at present ( @xmath62 ) flowed into the smbh , energy comparable to the previous outburst might be released ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the angular distance between the x - ray agn and the center line of the dust lane is @xmath64 or @xmath65  kpc ( figure  [ fig : ximg ] ) .",
    "if the agn is located at the center of the disk , the inclination angle of the disk is @xmath66 , and the disk is almost edge - on .",
    "this may also mean that the jets from the agn are almost on the plane of the sky at present .",
    "on the other hand , the positions of pairs of outer lobes show that the jets were not being injected on the plane of the sky and were oriented @xmath67 about the plane in the past @xcite .",
    "the change of the jet direction may be caused by precession @xcite .",
    "the cd galaxy is a harsh environment for dust . in the presence of the hot icm of @xmath68",
    "k , collision with hot particles destroys the dust .",
    "the destruction time is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the icm density and @xmath71 is the radius of dust grains @xcite .",
    "if we adopt @xmath72 @xcite and @xmath73 , the destruction time is @xmath74  yr . the mass loss rate from evolved stars in the galaxy is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the distance to the galaxy , and @xmath77 is the flux at @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "for hydra a , the luminosity distance is @xmath79  mpc , and the flux is @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the upper limit of the dust mass @xmath81 and since we avoid the complications caused by the difference of apertures at different wave lengths , we assume that @xmath82 . for these values , we obtain @xmath83 . assuming that the gas - to - dust ratio is @xmath84",
    ", the rate of accumulation of dust is @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "this equation can be solved easily ; @xmath81 approaches its final value @xmath86 in a time - scale of a few @xmath87 . since @xmath88",
    ", this may indicate that the dust is externally provided in the galaxy .    if the dust is not provided internally , the dust may be brought by merged galaxies .",
    "that is the case for centaurus  a @xcite .",
    "the misalignment between the disk and the galaxy s photometric axis ( section  [ sec : result ] ) is favorable to the merger scenario .",
    "based on a semi - analytic model , @xcite indicated that the fraction of cd galaxies that have cold gas brought through galaxy mergers induced by dynamical friction is small .",
    "however , their criterion for existence of cold gas in a cd galaxy is @xmath89 , and thus more cd galaxies should have cold gas of @xmath90 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , a complicated solution may be required .",
    "for example , while dust provided by evolved stars in a cd galaxy is shielded from the surrounding hot gas @xcite , it is mixed with cold gas provided by a weak cooling flow @xcite .      among cd galaxies with outstanding dust lanes and disks ,",
    "those of cygnus  a and hydra  a are known for having extremely active radio sources @xcite .",
    "the cd galaxy of cygnus  a has a well - developed cold disk rotating around the agn and the minor axis of the disk is parallel to the jets like hydra  a @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the cd galaxy of hercules  a does not have a disk - structure , although it has prominent twin jets @xcite .",
    "this may be because the cold disk has disappeared by now , while it caused the strong outburst in the past .",
    "note that in some non - cd radio galaxies , dust lanes that resemble the one we found in hydra  a have been observed @xcite .",
    "we observed the cd galaxy of the hydra  a cluster with subaru telescope and found an outstanding dust lane .",
    "the disk seen as the dust lane is edge - on and the minor axis is parallel to radio jets , but it is not parallel to the minor axis of the host galaxy .",
    "the disk mass and the rotation period are @xmath91 and @xmath92  yr , respectively .",
    "the column density of the dust lane ( @xmath93 ) is consistent with the constraints obtained by x - ray observations .",
    "our results may indicate that galaxy mergers and the supply of cold gas to the smbhs is essential to the most powerful activities of the agns .",
