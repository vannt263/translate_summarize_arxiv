    "gamma - ray pulsars are the brightest objects in the sky above 100 mev and the only identified gev galactic sources .",
    "although there are presently around 1700 known radio pulsars , only a relatively small fraction of these are detected at higher energies .",
    "the egret detector on the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) detected six @xmath0-ray pulsars with high confidence @xcite , five of which were known radio pulsars .",
    "in addition , there were a few @xmath0-ray pulsars detected with lower confidence , one of which was the millisecond psr .",
    "the large area space telescope ( glast ) , set for launch in late 2007 , will have a sensitivity about 30 times better than that of egret and is expected to detect many more @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "population synthesis can predict the number of expected @xmath0-ray pulsar detections , but the results are highly model - dependent . as a consequence of this sensitive model dependence ,",
    "the number of @xmath0-ray pulsars that glast does detect , especially the ratio of radio - loud to radio - quiet pulsars , will be an excellent discriminator between @xmath0-ray models . using polar cap models to describe the @xmath0-ray emission , population synthesis studies of @xcite",
    "have estimated that glast should detect several hundred pulsars .",
    "population synthesis studies for outer gap models @xcite generally predict fewer radio - loud @xmath0-ray pulsars and a much higher ratio of radio - quiet to radio - loud pulsars . these studies evolved neutron stars in the galaxy from birth distributions of period , magnetic field , position and space velocity , but excluded the population of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) . since msps are thought to be recycled through spin - up by accretion from a binary companion ,",
    "their evolution is somewhat more complicated .",
    "because of their very short periods , msps can have spin - down luminosities that are comparable to those of young pulsars and therefore should be sources of high - energy photons .",
    "indeed , a much higher fraction of the total radio msp population ( around 225 ) have been detected as x - ray sources ( around 60 , including globular cluster pulsars ) compared to normal pulsars .",
    "the pulsed x - ray spectra of most msps in the galactic plane are dominated by non - thermal emission @xcite , so these sources must be accelerating particles to high energy .",
    "polar cap models predict that msps should produce a high - energy emission component due to curvature radiation up to energies around 50 gev @xcite .",
    "outer gap models also predict that msps could produce high - energy emission from particles moving downward toward the stellar surface from the outer gap @xcite .",
    "predictions for the number of @xmath0-ray msps in globular clusters have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "studies of the radio characteristics of msps indicate some differences with those of the normal pulsar population . @xcite and also @xcite found that msps are somewhat less luminous than normal pulsars .",
    "however , these studies compare the pseudo - luminosities , i.e. the observed radio flux times the square of the distance , which are dependent on solid angle and observer viewing angle , and do not address real luminosities .",
    "these studies also found that the beam radii of msps , although larger on average than those of normal pulsars , are smaller than expected by an extrapolation of beam radii with a @xmath1 dependence of the normal pulsars population .",
    "the average msp beam widths seem to reach a saturated value of around @xmath2 , whereas the extrapolated value is greater than @xmath3 .",
    "we will argue however that relativistic effects @xcite may strongly influence the shape of msp profiles .",
    "msp pulse profiles have considerably larger duty cycles than normal pulsars and the beaming fractions are thought to be around 75% @xcite .",
    "the profiles were originally thought to have more complex structure , a feature that was attributed to the presence of multipole field components , possibly induced by the accretion phase @xcite .",
    "but the observations of @xcite do not support this claim and show that msp profiles display in general only marginally more complexity .",
    "the more observable details afforded by the larger duty cycles make the profiles seem more complex with the large beams increasing the chance of detecting emission from both poles . additionally , the emission height dependence on frequency ( radius - to - frequency mapping ) is less strong , and this is understandable since the msp magnetospheres are much smaller .",
    "in general , msp radio profiles are consistent with an expanded version of normal pulsar emission on open dipole field lines , with the smaller widths being attributed to emission occurring only on a subset of the open field lines or to relativistic distortions of the beam .",
    "we present in this paper new results of a population synthesis of msps born within the galactic disk . in this study",
    "we define msps as those pulsars with period derivatives @xmath4 .",
    "this criterion includes the binary pulsars j1744 - 3922 and b0655 + 64 with periods of 172.4 ms and 195.7 ms , respectively , but excludes the binary pulsar j1711 - 4322 with a period of 102.6 ms . by means of a monte carlo population code ,",
    "we treat them as point particles and evolve their trajectories , periods and period derivatives from their birth ( at time of their last spin - up phase ) forward in time to the present .",
    "we exclude msps in globular clusters from our study . after determining a present - day spatial equilibrium distribution ,",
    "we assign radio and @xmath0-ray characteristics to each msp and then filter its properties for detection through a select group of radio surveys and the @xmath0-ray instruments egret , agile and glast .",
    "we normalize the number of simulated radio msps to the number detected by the group of radio surveys , allowing us to predict the number of radio - loud and radio - quiet @xmath0-ray msps detected by egret , agile and glast .",
    "we recently added the swinburne intermediate latitude survey to our selected group of radio surveys used in previous studies .",
    "of the ten surveys , six of them , arecibo 2 & 3 , greenbank 2 & 3 , molongo 2 and parkes 2 , have an observing frequency around 400 mhz , and four surveys at 1400 mhz include parkes 1 , jodrell bank 2 , parkes multibeam , and swinburne intermediate latitude . in our computer code , we use the characteristics of these ten surveys to determine the minimum flux threshold for each simulated pulsar ( for details see @xcite ) at the observing frequency of the survey . while we recognize that some of these radio surveys were not very sensitive to the detection of msps , we include them to confirm null detections .",
    "when the simulated radio flux is below the flux threshold @xmath5 of all the radio surveys that potentially are viewing the simulated pulsar , we refer to the pulsar as being radio - quiet . otherwise , the pulsar is radio - loud .",
    "these characterizations are relative to the sensitivity of the surveys and are not addressing the nature of the emission process .",
    "we then are restricted to comparing the characteristics of the pulsars simulated by our computer code to those msps detected by this select group of radio surveys , excluding msps detected only by other surveys .",
    "we assume exponential spatial distributions of the form described in the study of @xcite , but using a scale height parameter above the galactic plane of 200 pc for msps in contrast to 75 pc used in our simulations for nps .",
    "we use a maxwellian distribution with a characteristic width of @xmath6 = 70 km / s to describe the supernova kick velocity at birth from the study of @xcite , resulting in an average velocity of 110 km / s .",
    "we assume a uniform birth rate back in time to 12 gyr . to determine an equilibrium spatial distribution , we evolved a group of 40,000 neutron stars to the present without making any selections .",
    "as in our recent studies , @xcite and @xcite , we use the galactic potential ( mass model 2 ) of @xcite ( w. dehnen private communication ) to evolve the trajectories of msps using a 5th order cash - karp runge - kutta routine @xcite .",
    "while msps are born in binary systems , we have not attempted to simulate the evolution of the binary system , but rather treat the system as a point particle and evolve it within the galactic potential . with low kick velocities ,",
    "the msps remain bound to the galaxy and achieve normalized equilibrium distributions in galactic radius ( r ) and galactic height ( z ) shown in figure 1 as solid curves with the initial distributions represented by the dotted curves .    fitting the equilibrium distributions results in radial and out - of - plane scale heights of 4.2 kpc and 0.50 kpc , respectively . the z scale height of 0.50 kpc is in good agreement with the one obtained by @xcite of 0.50 kpc and with the recent determinations of the scale heights of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) by @xcite of 0.41 kpc . in subsequent calculations",
    ", we use these equilibrium distributions to randomly select the present - day spatial distribution of msps within the galaxy . in choosing the r and z values of msps from such an evolved distribution rather than evolving each msp from its birth location",
    ", we ignore any dependence of evolved r and z on msp age .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the transverse motion of a pulsar causes a change in the pulsar s detected period . due to the doppler effect ,",
    "an increase in the pulsar s period derivative is observed .",
    "the contribution to @xmath7 due to this effect is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pulsar period , @xmath10 is the proper motion , and @xmath11 is the distance .",
    "for msps , whose period derivatives are extremely small , this effect can increase period derivatives significantly , in some cases by as much as 90% as noted by @xcite who have also included the smaller effects of galactic rotation and vertical acceleration . in this study",
    ", we only include the shklovskii effect due to the proper motion of the simulated pulsar .",
    "while it may be that the magnetic field of msps decays slowly , we have assumed a constant field during their lifetime .",
    "however , due to selection effects , the observed field distribution will differ from the initial distribution .",
    "we explored power laws with various indices to characterize the distribution of pulsar surface magnetic field at the birth line . while @xcite preferred a power law with an index of -2 , the group of 22 msps used in their study had smaller magnetic fields .",
    "for the group of 56 msps in this study , we find a preferred index of -1 with a normalized distribution of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is in units of @xmath14 g. we choose a @xmath15 and a @xmath16 that provides the best agreement between various simulated and detected distributions .",
    "having the magnetic field for a simulated msp , we can obtain its initial period with a spin - up relation . @xcite and",
    "similarly @xcite found that for recycled pulsars spun up by accretion at the eddington limit from a binary companion , the initial period is estimated by the expression @xmath17 which can be rewritten as a birth line in the @xmath18 diagram by the form @xmath19 where the period is in seconds and the period derivative is @xmath20 . having the magnetic field , the initial period , and the age , we can determine the present period and period derivative of the msp assuming a pure dipole spin down .",
    "however , recent studies of lmxbs where the spin periods of accreting neutron stars were measured have allowed the estimation of the surface magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite conclude that the general properties of lmxbs can be understood if the accretion rates range from the eddington critical accretion rate to @xmath21 times that rate .",
    "these different accretion rates lead to different birth lines in the @xmath22 diagram . to incorporate a distribution of accretion rates",
    ", we have included an approximate procedure in which we dither the intercept of the following birth line @xmath23 where the dithering parameter @xmath24 varies from 0 to 2.8 .",
    "the birth line can be reformulated by the expression @xmath25 the extremes of the dithering parameter @xmath24 represent the approximate eddington accretion critical rate and @xmath21 times that rate ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) . while we explored a gaussian distribution of the dithering parameter , we obtain better agreement with a ramp distribution that increases by a factor of 4 between 0 and 2.8 . with the magnetic field randomly selected from the distribution of equation 2 , we then use equation 6 to obtain the initial period of the simulated msp .",
    "however , we impose a minimum initial period of @xmath26 = 1.3 ms in accord with the rxte studies of lmxbs by @xcite . having randomly determined the pulsar s age assuming a uniform birth rate , we spin the pulsar down to obtain the present period and period derivative assuming constant magnetic surface field .",
    "a constant magnetic field used in this study of msps is in contrast to the assumption of magnetic field decay in our simulations of nps @xcite .",
    "in our previous studies of nps @xcite , we adopted the intrinsic radio luminosity model given by the general form @xmath27 from @xcite ( acc ) with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , but reduced the luminosity @xmath31 by a factor of 60 @xcite and by 73 @xcite to obtain adequate agreement between the simulated birth rate , flux , and distance distributions and those detected , particularly by the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( pmbps ) ( see @xcite ) . in acc ,",
    "the predicted birth rate was 0.13 neutron stars per century . in order to obtain a birth rate near 2 neutron stars per century",
    ", we had to decrease the luminosity constant @xmath31 .",
    "the assumed radio luminosity is directly related to the simulated neutron star birth rate .",
    "various studies propose neutron star birth rates that span somewhat of a range .",
    "for example , the a range of birth rates from 0.9 to 1.9 per century was obtained from the analysis of pmbps by @xcite . in a recent population synthesis , @xcite estimate a larger birth rate of about 2.8 per century , whereas @xcite find @xmath32 per century from their analysis .",
    "more recently @xcite determined the reduction factor of the radio luminosity by normalizing the simulated neutron star birth rate to rate of type ii supernovae of 2.1 per century , following the work of @xcite , using only the parkes multibeam survey , as we may have the best description of the flux threshold @xmath5 for that survey ( crawford , private communication ) .    while the neutron star birth rate of 2.1 per century provides a constraint on the luminosity of nps , msps appear in a very different region in the @xmath22 diagram , requiring careful consideration of the period and period derivative dependence of the radio luminosity used by the population synthesis study .",
    "often , radio astronomers refer to the radio luminosity in terms of a  pseudoluminosity \" ( @xmath33 ) determined from the radio flux @xmath34 observed at a specific frequency and the pulsar distance @xmath11 .",
    "one can not generally determine the intrinsic radio luminosity of a given pulsar from the @xmath33 , even at a given frequency , as the detected average flux is strongly dependent on the viewing geometry .",
    "however , if the number of detected pulsars in a group is large , one might be justified in assuming that the emission region of the group of pulsars is completely sampled in a random fashion .",
    "therefore , the detected @xmath33 would be proportional to the intrinsic luminosity of the group of pulsars if the surveys represented an unbiased sample of the true flux distribution . however , since radio surveys necessarily sample the high end of the flux distribution , inferring the intrinsic luminosities of pulsars is difficult at best .",
    "in addition , selection effects of the radio surveys may be different for nps and msps , and these effects do influence the sampling of the emission region .",
    "for example , the width of the pulse profile is used in the determination of the flux threshold @xmath35 for each radio survey ; therefore , one would expect that narrow pulse profiles or larger inclination angles are preferably detected . regardless of these effects , such comparisons are important in characterizing differences between nps and msps .",
    "@xcite compared the average @xmath36 of a group of msps with that of a group of nps and found that the mean @xmath37 values for their groups of 31 msps and of 369 nps of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the authors conclude that msps and nps have very different radio luminosity distributions .",
    "since this study was performed , the ne2001 distance model @xcite was developed .",
    "we use the pulsar distance given by the ne2001 model unless the distance has been determined by other more accurate methods . after this distance correction and using the 1400 mhz fluxes in the atnf catalogue that have a recorded uncertainty @xcite , we find average @xmath37 values of @xmath40 for our select group of 39 msps ( 24 with s1400 fluxes ) and @xmath41 for a group of 1102 nps ( 869 with s1400 fluxes ( references in atnf catalogue ) ) detected by parkes multibeam and the swinburne intermediate latitude surveys .",
    "the uncertainties are just the statistical error in the mean and do not take into account the error in the fluxes and distances .",
    "subtle selection effects may be introduced within the context of a population statistics study with a group of surveys that have different sensitivities .",
    "as a result , it may be inappropriate to compare these mean @xmath37 values with those from @xcite because of the different samples of pulsars .",
    "the msps recently discovered by the parkes multibeam and swinburne surveys are not only more distant but also weaker with effectively smaller @xmath37 .",
    "we have chosen to reproduce the @xmath37 values of the normal pulsars and msps detected by these surveys to constrain our luminosity model .",
    "we adjust our intrinsic radio luminosity model such that the simulated mean @xmath37 values approximately match both the mean values of @xmath40 for msps and @xmath41 for nps detected by both the parkes multibeam and the swinburne intermediate latitude surveys .",
    "we find that the exponents of the period ( @xmath42 ) and period derivative ( @xmath43 ) dependence of the luminosity are not uniquely constrained to specific values but are correlated with each other .",
    "we find better agreement between the various simulated distributions for nps with values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the coefficient of the luminosity is adjusted to give a birth rate of 2.1 neutron stars per century using the parkes multibeam and the swinburne intermediate latitude surveys .",
    "we were able to find a common radio luminosity that provides adequate results for both nps and msps , given by the expression @xmath46    in this study , we assume that the radio emission originates from a single core beam and a single cone beam axially aligned with the magnetic field from each pole of the star and isotropically distributed in the sky . as indicated by @xcite , the profiles of msps display similar structure to those of nps , suggesting that the core or central beam and the conal beam make similar contributions to np and msp profiles .",
    "however , as discussed later , due to the rapid rotation of msps , relativistic effects are more evident in the pulse profiles of msps than in those of nps @xcite .",
    "we use the same description for the core beam as in our past study of @xcite , but we replace the geometry of the cone beam from the @xcite with the description of @xcite having the form @xmath47 which describes the characteristic width of the conal beam at 0.1% of the peak intensity of the profile assuming that the edges of the pulse are along the last open field line . they find that the altitude of the emission @xmath48 in stellar radii is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is in units of @xmath51 . in this formulation ,",
    "the overall period dependence of the characteristic width of the conal beam is @xmath52 , reproducing well the trend observed for nps and msps @xcite .    in the formulation of a gaussian conal beam , the characteristic width @xmath53 requires the specification of the radius @xmath54 and width @xmath55 of the annulus of the beam .",
    "the characteristic width of @xcite is for 0.1% of the peak intensity making @xmath56 .",
    "within such a model , one is free to specify some form for either @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "we adopted @xmath59 in our study of both normal and msps .",
    "we find that the population statistics are not very sensitive to the choice of this value , which we have arrived at from our study of three peak pulse profiles of radio pulsars . in our study of the characteristics of core and cone beams of about 20 radio pulsars",
    "whose profiles have three peaks , we found ( @xcite and in preparation ) that the ratio of core - to - cone peak fluxes does not follow the @xmath60 dependence suggested in the work of acc . in the acc model , the profiles of msps are dominated by the central core beam , so that even at small impact angles the conal beam would not be seen .",
    "as seen in the study of @xcite , similar complexity is manifested in the msps profiles as in profiles nps , indicating that the conal beam is quite prominent .",
    "recent polarimetry studies of young radio pulsars also call the acc core - to - cone ratio into question . @xcite and @xcite measured the radio polarization of nine pulsars , six of which had characteristic ages less than 100 kyr .",
    "they found that the profiles of all the young pulsars indicate a significant degree of linear polarization and a low degree of circular polarization , which is a traditional feature of conal emission . in this study",
    ", the two older pulsars with characteristic ages greater than 1 myr do not show any degree of polarization .",
    "they conclude , as did @xcite , that the profiles of young short period pulsars tend to be characterized by partial cones .",
    "similarly , in a more recent study @xcite measured polarization profiles of 14 young pulsars with ages @xmath61 75 kyr .",
    "they found that the profiles are dominated by linear polarization , suggesting that the core beam is weakly manifested , if at all .",
    "because of these inconsistencies , we have reassessed the relationship between the core and cone beams ( @xcite ) , using three - peak normal pulsars and a few three - peak msps . in our three - peak pulsar study",
    ", we find for the ratio of peak fluxes a power - law dependence with a break in period at about 0.7 s having the approximate form @xmath62    hence in this model , short period pulsars are much less core dominated than in the acc model",
    ". the model does not distinguish between young short - period pulsars and msps , although there is evidence ( @xcite ) that the ratio of core - to - cone peak fluxes may be different for a young pulsar and a msp with the same period .",
    "the shapes of msp profiles are complicated by relativistic effects , but due to the wide emission beams , contributions from both poles are often seen in the profiles , making the analysis of the viewing geometry and conal widths difficult . with this model ,",
    "we do accommodate more complex pulse profiles for short period pulsars than in the acc model .    in describing the core and cone angle - integrated spectra , we assume indices of -2.36 and -1.72 , respectively . while these indices are not measurable , they are related in a complex fashion , due to selection effects , to the measured spectral indices .",
    "using these values , our simulation gives a flux - averaged spectral index of @xmath63 for msps . within our select group of surveys ,",
    "we find 20 msps within the atnf catalogue whose spectral indices have recorded uncertainties @xcite with a mean of @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite found a mean spectral index of @xmath65 for a group of 32 msps .",
    "they also point out that msps have significantly steeper mean spectral indices than nps . for a group of 346 nps",
    ", they find a mean spectral index of @xmath66 . in our simulation",
    ", we found it necessary to have softer angle - integrated spectral indices for the core and cone beams of nps , resulting in a mean spectral index of @xmath67 .",
    "this value agrees well with the mean spectral index of @xmath68 for the 245 nps with indices that have recorded uncertainties in the atnf catalogue ( references therein ) .",
    "adopting this radio luminosity and beam geometry model , we attempt to describe radio emission properties from both nps and msps @xcite .",
    "the success of this radio model is remarkable in describing the physical luminosities of both nps and msps , given the range of three decades in period and seven decades in period derivative between nps and msps .",
    "however , it is clear that there are many complexities that may not modeled correctly and that the population synthesis study may not be very sensitive to various characteristics of the beam geometry .",
    "because of their rapid rotation , msps can display very different features in their pulse profiles than those observed in the profiles of nps .",
    "these features can be partly understood in terms of the relativistic effects of aberration , time delay and the sweep back of the retarded dipole field @xcite .",
    "the shorter the pulsar period , the more dramatically these effects are manifested in the profiles . according to equation 10 , the conal emission of pulsars with short periods occurs at high altitude relative to the light cylinder radius . for msps",
    "the altitude of emission for the cone beams ( @xmath48 ) is @xmath69 .",
    "the combined effects of time delay and aberration result in a shift in phase of the conal beam .",
    "deformations in the shape of some profiles of msps are a result of the distortion of the open field volume of the retarded dipole @xcite . while relativistic effects are important in understanding the shape of the profile and in studying correlation with high - energy profiles , in a recent study @xcite , we find that the phase - averaged flux is very similar for relativistic and nonrelativistic emission . since in population statistics studies ,",
    "the average flux of the profile is the determining parameter that is compared to the threshold of each radio survey , we have neglected these effects in this study .",
    "because of the lack of a theoretical understanding of the mechanism that produces the radio emission , the radio emission model is phenomenological by nature .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath0-ray emission models are motivated by theory .",
    "two competing @xmath0-ray emission models , the polar cap and outer gap models , assume different locations in the magnetosphere where the acceleration of charge occurs . in the outer gap model ,",
    "the acceleration of charge takes place in vacuum gaps formed along the last open field line , between the null surface and the light cylinder . while we are beginning to incorporate an outer gap in our simulations @xcite , treating it on the same footing as the polar cap model using the same group of evolved neutron stars and selection criteria , we use only the polar cap model in this study of msps .",
    "recent outer gap models for msps @xcite actually assume that the high - energy emission originates not from the outer gap but near the neutron star , from particles flowing down from the gaps , and thus would have a very different high - energy emission geometry from that of normal pulsars .",
    "two regions in the @xmath22 diagram , separated by the curvature radiation ( cr ) pair death line , differentiate the @xmath0-ray luminosities and beam geometries within the polar cap model .",
    "pulsars above the cr line can produce cr photons that are energetic enough to pair produce in the strong magnetic field above the neutron star surface .",
    "the cr - initiated pair cascades have sufficient multiplicity to fully screen the parallel electric field everywhere except in the slot gap along a narrow region near the last open field line where the primary particles are accelerated along unscreened electric field lines .",
    "recent studies @xcite of the emission above the cr pair death line in the polar cap model have provided a framework for understanding @xmath0-ray emission from the slot gap .",
    "the electrons in the low altitude slot gap initiate pair cascade emission , which was incorporated in our simulations of @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite find that the primary particles along the last open field lines can be accelerated to high altitudes as the potential in the slot gap remains unscreened and the emission beam forms a characteristic caustic component @xcite . in recent population studies of nps ,",
    "we have begun to include both the low and high altitude emission geometries @xcite and both are included in this study for those simulated msps above the cr line .    however , as one can see in figure 2 , all the msps with the exception of one lie below the cr line where curvature radiation no longer produces pairs .",
    "these pulsars can produce much weaker pair cascades through inverse compton scattering radiation .",
    "when pulsars are no longer able to produce abundant pair cascades , they do not form slot gaps above the polar cap @xcite as the parallel electric field is not screened on all open magnetic field lines .",
    "as the @xmath0-ray energies are below the pair threshold , the curvature radiation from the primary electrons escapes out to infinity along all open field lines . in this pair - starved polar cap model , the primary particles continue to accelerate and radiate to high altitudes above the polar cap out to the light cylinder along all the open field lines .",
    "however , cr emitted by the particles can be inhibited by resonant cyclotron absorption of radio emission @xcite where synchrotron radiation is more efficient particle energy loss mechanism than cr .",
    "since synchrotron photons usually have lower energies than curvature photons , we have not included this mechanism in the pair - starved model in this study .",
    "the cr emission model below the cr pair death line used in this study is developed from the work by @xcite .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath42 and the viewing angle @xmath70 determine which open field lines are sampled by the line of sight . as illustrated in figure 3 , the line of sight intersects tangentially a particular open field line with a radius of curvature @xmath71 at a radial distance r and polar angle @xmath72 .",
    "the open field lines are defined within the polar cap angle given by the expression @xmath73 where p is the pulsar period in seconds , @xmath74 is the neutron star radius ( @xmath75 cm ) and c is the speed of light .",
    "we partition the open field lines through a dimensionless parameter , @xmath76 , that varies between 0 and 1 and is defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the polar angle of the open field line at the intersection with the surface of the star .",
    "the particle emits curvature photons along the line of sight at an angle @xmath79 given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the phase angle , @xmath42 is the magnetic inclination and @xmath70 is the viewing angle .",

    ", we also show the @xmath0-ray pulsars that were detected by egret ( upper left ) , including the msp . in the case of geminga ( cross in upper right )",
    ", it is not clear whether its radio silence results from a misalignment of the @xmath0-ray and radio beams or from its intrinsic radio weakness . while it is unclear how many of the egret unidentified sources might be msps detected as point sources , the simulation predicts that a few may be radio - quiet @xmath0-ray msps .",
    "all the simulated @xmath0-ray pulsars that are detected by egret , agile and glast lie below the curvature radiation pair death line in the @xmath22 diagram ( figure 7 ) . as discussed above , in this pair - starved polar cap model , curvature radiation escapes along all open field lines .",
    "however , as indicated by @xcite , curvature radiation can be limited when the accelerated particles undergo resonant cyclotron absorption of radio photons under special circumstances .",
    "the excited particles emit synchrotron radiation typically at lower energies than curvature radiation .",
    "while we are in the process of developing a full three - dimensional study of these processes , in the present calculation we have not limited the curvature radiation in altitude .",
    "therefore , our results may be somewhat optimistic . in figure 7 , the @xmath0-ray msps cluster in the lower left of the @xmath22 diagram because the @xmath0-ray luminosity increases with decreasing @xmath9 .    in table 2",
    ", we present the @xmath0-ray msps statistics for radio - loud and radio - quiet pulsars . due to the uncertainties in the radio luminosity , we vary the coefficient of the radio luminosity in equation 8 by @xmath123 to obtain a range in radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "since the simulation is normalized to the detected number of radio pulsars , there is no variation in the number of radio - loud @xmath0-ray pulsars . of the 33 - 40",
    "radio - quiet @xmath0-ray msps predicted to be detected by glast , about 6 have fluxes above the @xmath124 photons/@xmath125/s level ( grenier , private communication ) , that glast may be able to detect through blind period searches .",
    "however , since 70% of the msps in the atnf catalogue are in binaries , many of these radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsars are expected to be in binary systems . it will be difficult for glast to detect pulsed emission from these msps in blind period searches due to timing uncertainties associated with the orbital motion . without radio ephemerides , glast will detect binary msps only as point sources .    in order to explore the nature of the radio - quietness of the glast pulsars , we present in figure 8 histograms of the radio flux at 1400 mhz of",
    "the detected ( solid dark gray histograms ) and simulated ( open thin histograms ) radio pulsars in ( a ) and the radio flux of glast radio - quiet ( solid light gray histograms ) and radio - loud ( open thick histograms ) in ( b ) .",
    "as expected , glast radio - loud pulsars have large radio fluxes . however , the glast radio - quiet pulsars form two groups , one with a flux distribution very similar to the radio detected and simulated pulsars in figure 8a and the other with a much lower flux distribution that would be difficult to detect without deep radio pointings .",
    "the parkes multibeam and swinburne intermediate latitude surveys are the two most sensitive surveys in our select group of radio surveys .",
    "however , they cover a rather narrow strip along the galactic disk , and msps seem to be rather scattered in space and are not as correlated with the galactic disk as are nps . as a result ,",
    "many of the glast detected pulsars are radio - quiet because they happen to be outside the sensitive survey regions or have radio fluxes that are slightly lower than the survey thresholds .    in figure 9 , we plot the impact angle @xmath126 as a function of the radio flux at 1400 mhz for the simulated group of glast radio - quiet pulsars .",
    "we can see that the two groups of fluxes correspond to two groups of impact angles .",
    "the msps in the low flux group with large impact angles will not be observed as radio sources without deep radio observations .",
    "however , the simulation suggests that they can be seen as @xmath0-ray point sources . in the pair - starved model of @xmath0-ray emission",
    ", curvature radiation occurs along all open field lines all the way out to the light cylinder .",
    "while the intensity of curvature radiation decreases at higher altitudes for nearby pulsars , we predict that glast should be able to detect them as point sources , yet their radio emission will be very difficult to detect as the radio beam and the @xmath0-ray beam are separated by large angles .",
    "however , the higher flux group with smaller impact angles would be detected by glast as point sources and potentially are detectable with pointed radio observations .    as a result , our simulations suggest that it will be important to follow up glast detections with radio observations in order to discover a greater number of radio - loud @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "the predicted energy spectra of msps are very different than those of either nps or agns . in this pair - starved polar cap model , the energy cutoffs of the msp @xmath0-ray spectra",
    "are predicted to be in the 10 - 50 gev energy region @xcite suitable for glast .    clearly",
    "the number of detected radio - quiet and radio - loud @xmath0-ray msps depends strongly on the detection thresholds of radio surveys and @xmath0-ray instruments . in figure 10 , we present the log(n)-log(s ) for the radio flux at 400 mhz ( a ) and 1400 mhz ( b ) and for egret ( c ) and glast ( d ) .",
    "the light shaded histograms represent the simulated undetected source counts .",
    "the dark histograms represent the simulated detected source counts by the select group of ten radio surveys at 400 mhz ( a ) and 1400 mhz ( b ) . for egret ( c ) and glast ( d ) ,",
    "the dark and medium dark histograms represent the simulated source counts for radio - loud and radio - quiet @xmath0-ray msps , respectively .",
    "the appearance of fractions of a pulsar in the figure is a result of the re - normalizing the distributions because the simulation was run for ten times the number of detected msps to improve the simulated statistics . assuming a uniform distribution of sources in space with isotropic emission of equal flux , one expects to a slope in the log(n)-log(s ) diagram of -3/2 . indeed",
    "the tails of these distributions have slopes very similar to -3/2 .",
    "while for egret and glast the log(n)s of simulated detections have a sharp decrease with decreasing flux , the log(n)s of simulated radio detections have a more gentle roll over , which may reflect the larger number of factors that determine the minimum flux threshold for the radio surveys .",
    "both the number of undetected radio and @xmath0-ray sources follow a simple power law far below the sensitivity of the radio surveys and @xmath0-ray instruments .",
    "we have presented a monte - carlo simulation of the galactic - plane population of msps and corresponding predictions for the numbers of both radio - quiet and radio - loud msps that are detectable as @xmath0-ray sources . in order to accomplish this",
    ", we made significant improvements in our population statistics monte carlo code by adding the more realistic description of the galactic potential of @xcite with a more accurate 5th order cash - karp runge - kutta trajectory integration routine @xcite , using improved all - sky threshold maps for egret @xcite and glast ( grenier & casandjian , private communication ) , and including the swinburne intermediate latitude radio survey @xcite .",
    "we have modified the intrinsic radio luminosity model of acc to describe the total radio luminosity of both normal and msps . from our study of radio pulsars with three - peak profiles",
    "@xcite , we find that the ratio of the core - to - cone peak fluxes for short period pulsars is much smaller for short period pulsars than the ratio predicted by acc model .",
    "although msps have on average larger pulse widths than nps , this resulting radio beam geometry model provides a reasonable agreement to the average pseudoluminosities and pulse widths at 1400 mhz and pulse widths of both nps and msps .",
    "we include a @xmath0-ray beam geometry and luminosity model of the curvature radiation from all open field lines within a pair - starved polar cap model @xcite that accounts for @xmath0-ray emission below the curvature radiation pair death line , which is applicable to msps .",
    "these improvements in our computer code have allowed us to study the population statistics of radio and @xmath0-ray msps to complement our previous studies of nps from the galactic disk . as a first order study",
    ", we believe that we have improved the simulation by including a beam geometry for msps and an intrinsic radio luminosity whose functional form allows for the description of the population statistics of normal pulsars .",
    "the actual beam geometry of msps may turn out to be significantly different and require a different model than the one proposed here from the work of @xcite .",
    "the population statistics study is not sensitive enough to discriminate between beam geometry models as the average flux of the profile is the quantity that is compared to the @xmath5s of the radio surveys .",
    "a detailed study including relativistic effects will be necessary along with high quality polarization data may enable establishment of systematic trends that allows for the development of an adequate beam model for msps .    in this study , we do not attempt to describe the numerous msps within globular clusters . limiting our study to the msps born in the galactic disk ,",
    "we treat them as point particles , evolving their location within the galactic potential and their spin - down , after spin - up by mass accretion from a binary companion star has ended .",
    "this group of old , short period pulsars with low magnetic fields are given radio and @xmath0-ray beam and luminosity characteristics and filtered through a set of ten radio surveys and the @xmath0-ray instruments egret , agile and glast .",
    "our simulation is run until the number of simulated radio pulsars is equal to the number detected by the same group of radio surveys .",
    "the radio luminosity is adjusted in our study of nps @xcite to give a birth rate of type ii supernovae of 2.1 per century to agree with the study of @xcite and to reproduce the detected mean pseudo - luminosities and spectral indices of msps and nps , after which there are no further adjustments performed in the simulation of msps . allowing for a @xmath127 10% variation in the radio luminosity , we predict a birth rate of @xmath128 msps per century , which is in good agreement with the studies of @xcite ( @xmath129 per century ) and @xcite ( @xmath130 per century ) .",
    "while the population statistics studies of lmxbs contain numerous uncertainties , our simulated birth rate agrees with the estimate of the birth rate of lmxbs from the preferred model ( f ) of @xcite ( @xmath131 per century ) .",
    "we are also in agreement with @xcite as our description of the spectral properties of the core and cone beams for msps requires steeper angle - integrated spectral indices than those for the simulated nps .    in outer gap accelerator models",
    "@xcite , msps are not expected to produce @xmath0-ray emission above 1 - 2 gev ( @xcite , hirotani private communication 2005 ) due to the smaller electric field and larger radius of curvature in the gap .",
    "thus , detected emission from msps above 5 gev would imply an origin near the polar cap .",
    "@xcite propose that particles accelerated in the outer gaps could be the origin of msp radiation at super - gev energies , but only if the cascade emission from the particles as they travel down toward the neutron star surface is visible .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that both the upward - going radio emission and downward - going @xmath0-ray emission could be visible to the same observer . in that event",
    ", one would expect the radio and high - energy peaks to be out of phase , and x - ray and radio peaks are often in phase for msps ( e.g. , , ) . in any case",
    ", glast observations of msps will be an excellent model discriminator .",
    "our simulations predict the number of radio - loud and radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsars observed by the instruments egret , agile and glast .",
    "egret was only able to detect one msp , psr , during its nine - year mission .",
    "egret did not have the capability of performing blind period searches of pulsars and required reliable radio ephemerides to detect @xmath0-ray pulsations .",
    "however , these observations were prior to the parkes multibeam pulsar survey and the swinburne intermediate latitude survey that tripled the number of detected radio msps in galaxy ( not counting those in globular clusters ) .",
    "we predict that egret should have detected as point sources eight radio - loud and @xmath132 radio - quiet @xmath0-ray msps , some of which could be associated with egret unidentified sources . however , the recently revised all - sky egret threshold map with dark clouds @xcite , used in our simulations , has significantly affected the catalogue of egret unidentified sources .",
    "as the all - sky threshold map for agile has not been recently updated , our predictions for agile might be somewhat optimistic .",
    "however , the trend in the statistics for egret , agile and glast suggests that the number of radio - quiet and radio - loud @xmath0-ray msps predicted to be detected by agile might be reasonable .",
    "the shklovskii effect is a significant , positive contribution to the intinsic @xmath7 of the pulsar resulting in much larger measured @xmath7s and needs to be taken into account in population statistics studies .",
    "the effect of having to decrease the intrinsic @xmath7 to accomodate this effect results is pulsars with lower @xmath0-ray luminosities .",
    "we predict @xmath133 of radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsars for glast with the ratio of radio - quiet to radio - loud increasing from 1.5 for egret to 3.2 for glast .",
    "curvature radiation of @xmath0-rays below the curvature pair death line occurs along all open field lines all the way out to the light cylinder , as the weak production of pairs through nonresonant inverse compton scattering is insufficient to screen the electric field .",
    "the increased sensitivity of glast results in a large number of detections at higher altitudes where the @xmath0-ray beam is at large angles relative to the radio beam , resulting in radio fluxes below the flux thresholds of our select group of radio surveys .",
    "however , in many cases , the radio fluxes are relatively large but are outside of the sky region of the parkes multibeam and swinburne intermediate latitude surveys .",
    "msps are much less confined to the plane of the galactic disk than are nps and therefore often appear at high latitudes , far above the narrow belt covered by these more sensitive surveys .",
    "our simulations suggest that glast will detect many msps as point sources , and only a handful as radio - loud pulsars .",
    "the point sources can be identified as pulsar candidates by their spectra .",
    "@xcite indicate that the curvature radiation energy spectra of msps are very hard , with cutoffs in the region of 10 to 50 gev , well within the glast range .",
    "such detected candidates can easily be followed up with pointed radio observations to obtain the periods of the pulsars .",
    "thus , glast with radio follow - up observations offers the potential to discover many new msps in the galaxy .",
    "we are very grateful to isabelle grenier and jean - marc casandjian for providing a glast - lat 1 year point source threshold map .",
    "we express our appreciation to the anonymous referee for the insightful comments , which led to a much - improved manuscript .",
    "we are indebted to dunc lorimer who pointed out our neglect of the shklovskii effect in an earlier version of the manuscript .",

    "<S> we present results of a population synthesis of millisecond pulsars from the galactic disk . excluding globular clusters , we model the spatial distribution of millisecond pulsars by assuming their birth in the galactic disk with a random kick velocity and evolve them to the present within the galactic potential . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that normal and millisecond pulsars are standard candles described with a common radio luminosity model that invokes a new relationship between radio core and cone emission suggested by recent studies . in modeling the radio emission beams </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the relativistic effects of time delay , aberration and sweepback of the open field lines . </S>",
    "<S> while these effects are essential in understanding pulse profiles , the phase - averaged flux is adequately described without a relativistic model . </S>",
    "<S> we use a polar cap acceleration model for the @xmath0-ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> we present the preliminary results of our recent study and the implications for observing millisecond pulsars with glast and agile . </S>"
