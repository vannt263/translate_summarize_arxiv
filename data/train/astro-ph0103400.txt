    "the rare class of peculiar stars known as the r coronae borealis stars ( here , r crbs ) possess two very distinctive characteristics : a propensity to fade at unpredictable times by up to about 8 magnitudes , and an f - g supergiant - like atmosphere that is very h - deficient , he - rich , with considerable amounts of carbon .",
    "the fading of the visible light is often rapid with deep minima achieved in a few days to a few weeks but the return to maximum light is generally slower occurring over a period of several months .",
    "okeefe s ( 1939 ) suggestion that a r crb fades when a cloud of soot forms to obscure the photosphere has stood the test of time but the detailed identification of the dust particles and their mode and site of formation remain open questions .    infrared photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy of r crbs at maximum light and in decline have revealed several key features of the dusty circumstellar shells .",
    "discovery of ir - excesses provided confirmation of the hypothesis that dust grains were a major constituent of the circumstellar shells ( stein et al .",
    "1969 ; lee & feast 1969 ) .",
    "subsequent studies showed the dust to be at an equivalent blackbody temperature of 500 - 1000 k and present around almost all r crb stars ( feast & glass 1973 ; feast et al .",
    "1977 ; glass 1978 ) , but not distributed in a spherically homogeneous shell ( forrest , gillett , & stein 1972 ) .",
    "later observations including measurements of optical polarization suggested the dust may be ejected in a preferred plane ( stanford et al .",
    "1988 ; rao & raveendran 1993 ; clayton et al .",
    "feast et al .",
    "( 1977 ) showed that for rysgr , a 38 day pulsating r crb star , the intensity of the 3.5 @xmath0 m emission from the warm dust varied with the same period as the visual light showing that the dust was heated by starlight .",
    "this variation was shown to continue with no significant decline in mean intensity when the star experienced a deep visual decline .",
    "the mean intensity did , however , drop at times when the star remained at maximum light .",
    "this extended series of ir observations show that the circumstellar shell is composed of discrete clouds ; should a cloud form along the line of sight to the star , a decline is witnessed but the heating of the collection of clouds comprising the circumstellar shell is little affected because only a modest fraction of the stellar surface is blocked from directly heating the shell . _",
    "iras _ observations revealed , in addition to the warm dust detected from the ground , an extended ( ` fossil ' ) shell of cold ( t @xmath2 k ) dust ( gillett et al . 1986 ; rao & nandy 1986 ; walker 1986 ) .",
    "attribution of emission and absorption features in spectra of circumstellar shells around c - rich objects has been contested .",
    "two leading proposals vie for identification of emission features : polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( here , pahs ) , and hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( here , hac ) .",
    "since r crbs are h - deficient to different degrees , observation and analysis of their infrared emission features affords an opportunity to investigate the role of hydrogen in formation of the very large molecules or dust grains .",
    "hydrogen deficiency and other circumstances peculiar to r crb circumstellar shells may promote formation of other species .    with the advent of the _ infrared space observatory _",

    "the spectra were obtained with the _ short - wavelength spectrometer _ ( _ sws _ , de graauw et al .",
    "1996 ) on the _ iso _ spacecraft .",
    "spectra were recorded on separate 1 @xmath3 12 detector arrays .",
    "the complete spectrum was recorded as 12 different but overlapping spectral bands using different combinations of grating , aperture , and detector array .",
    "our spectra of ry sgr and v854 cen were observed at the slowest scanning speed , and , therefore , the highest _ sws _ resolving power of @xmath4 . the archived r crb spectrum had been taken at a higher speed and lower resolving power ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "standard pipeline processing of the raw _ sws _ data involves three principal steps : subtraction of the dark current , assignment of the wavelength scale , and the determination of the absolute fluxes .",
    "dark current measurements were obtained just prior and after an observation . these were averaged and subtracted from the signal from the source .",
    "wavelengths were calculated from the recorded grating positions and grating constants in the _ sws _ database ( valentijn et al .",
    "similarly , the raw signals were converted to absolute fluxes ( in janskys ) using calibrations in the _ sws _ database .",
    "each of the 12 bands was reduced separately , and then combined to form a composite spectrum .",
    "the output of the pipeline processing was a spectrum with discontinuities across the edges between adjacent bands .",
    "additional reduction procedures were then applied using the interactive software _ isap _ ( roelfsema et al . 1993 ) .",
    "spectra in the 12 bands were grouped into four larger bands covering the wavelength regions : 2.35 - 4.1 @xmath0 m , 4.0 - 12.0 @xmath0 m , 12.0 - 28.0 @xmath0 m , and 29.0 - 45.2 @xmath0 m . a spectrum from a single detector",
    "was inspected for abrupt jumps in signal level , and excessive noise levels .",
    "detectors so affected were dropped from the sample .",
    "a few bad data points were edited out .",
    "following recommendations by rita loidl ( private communication ) , we reduced the discontinuities by applying additive corrections relative to the signal from a reference detector within each aot band selected based on two criteria : ( 1 ) it should provide the smallest discontinuity at the band edges , and the slope that is most consistent with other detectors , and ( 2 ) choice of the detector should not change the mean flux level . the first band ( 2.4 - 2.6 @xmath0 m )",
    "was taken as the flux reference .",
    "we found that band 7 ( 7 - 12.0 @xmath0 m ) showed a significant offset between the scanning directions ; the ` down ' scan spectra were always of higher flux than the ` up ' scan spectra .",
    "this is attributed to ` memory effects ' ; the ` down ' scans were rejected .",
    "this procedure provided spectra of higher signal to noise ratio than achieved in all of our earlier attempts to eliminate the discontinuities .",
    "final spectra after rebinning to a resolving power of r = 1000 for ry sgr and v854 cen and r=400 for r crb are shown in figure 1 .",
    "since the stars are of variable flux in the infrared , we should not expect the _ iso _",
    "fluxes to match exactly published fluxes .",
    "v854 cen was caught by _",

    "the _ isophot _",
    "instrument was used for photometry at 6 bandpasses from 60 @xmath0 m to 200 @xmath0 m , and a low resolution spectrum was acquired from 2.5 @xmath0 m to 5 @xmath0 m and 5.8 @xmath0 m to 11.6 @xmath0 m at a resolving power of about 100 .",
    "the _ iso _",
    "photometry seems to show that r crb was a factor of about two brighter at minimum than when measured with _",
    "iras_. the 2.5 @xmath0 m to 11.6 @xmath0 m spectrum differs in shape but not average flux from ours : the _ isophot _ spectrum shows less flux than the _ sws _ spectrum for wavelengths shorter than about 4 @xmath0 m and longer than about 8.5 @xmath0 m with differences largest at the wavelength limits of the _ isophot _ spectrum . between 4 @xmath0 m and 8.5 @xmath0 m , the _ isophot _ spectrum has the higher flux by up to about a factor of two .",
    "the _ isophot _",
    "spectrum can not be well fitted by a blackbody spectrum .",
    "infrared excesses are conveniently expressed using a fit of a blackbody spectrum after consideration of the photospheric spectrum .",
    "this is an adequate artifice here because we are primarily interested in the emission and absorption features .",
    "predicted fluxes from model atmospheres show that the ir photospheric flux is essentially identical to that of a black body at the stellar effective temperature ( asplund et al .",
    "1997a , b ) .",
    "we resolve the observed spectrum into photospheric and circumstellar components ; the former does not exceed a 10% contribution at the short wavelength end of the _ sws _ bandpass . then , we fit the circumstellar spectrum with that of a blackbody .",
    "figure 1 shows the photospheric and circumstellar components with the observed spectra .",
    "the blackbody s contribution is subtracted to show more clearly the emission and absorption features that may be present ( see figure 2 , 3 , and 4 ) . over the _ sws _ spectrum , interstellar reddening ,",
    "slight at b and v , is negligible .    for v854 cen and ry sgr , the infrared excess",
    "is well fitted by a single blackbody : temperatures of 1040@xmath620 and 820@xmath610 k are obtained for v854 cen and ry sgr , respectively .",
    "the former temperature is slightly hotter than the 900 k estimated by lawson & cottrell ( 1989 ) from _ iras _ measurements , but is equal to the excitation temperature of circumstellar c@xmath7 molecules reported by rao & lambert ( 2000 ) .",
    "our temperature for ry sgr fits the _ iras _ measurements ; walker ( 1985 ) derived a blackbody temperature of 800@xmath650 k from a fit to broad - band measurements out to 60 @xmath0 m .",
    "a range of 600 k to 900 k was found by feast et al .",
    "( 1977 ) from ground - based photometry . to fit the r crb _ iso _ spectrum requires two blackbody components : one at t=610 @xmath8 k provides an adequate fit at wavelengths longer than 5 @xmath0 m , and the contribution from a hotter black body , t = 1390@xmath6270 k ,",
    "is needed to fit the shorter wavelengths .",
    "walker ( 1985 ) obtained a temperature of 650@xmath650 k from _ iras _ broad - band fluxes from 12 to 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "we note that the _ iras _ observations suggested a similar ( t = 680 k ) dust temperature ( rao & nandy 1986 ) . in each case",
    ", the blackbody simulation of the _ sws _ spectrum fits the observations to a few per cent with small deviations largely arising from emission features .    our adoption of a blackbody to represent the infrared fluxes is an artifice enabling us to display more clearly the emission features .",
    "representation of an infrared flux distribution by a blackbody is tantamount to assuming that either the dusty clouds are isothermal and optically thick at all wavelengths or the clouds are optically thin with an absorption coefficient that is quasi - gray in the infrared .",
    "an attempt to model the clouds as optically thin was made using laboratory measurements of the non - gray absorption coefficient for amorphous carbon samples from colangeli et al .",
    "( 1995 - see also bussoletti et al .",
    "1987 ) ; the measurements for their be sample were adopted .",
    "the inferred dust temperature is slightly lower , and the overall fit to the observed fluxes somewhat inferior to the results for the optically thick case .",
    "presumably , the latter result is , in part , due to the failure of the adopted laboratory measured absorption coefficients to represent the actual circumstellar dust ; the laboratory results depend on how the amorphous carbon is prepared .",
    "more refined models than either our simple optically thick and thin approximations would presumably provide higher quality fits but our present purpose of investigating the narrow emission features is served adequately by adopting the blackbody fit to the spectrum .",
    "amorphous carbon particles show increased absorption between about 6 @xmath0 m and 14 @xmath0 m ( see , for example , colangeli et al.s figure 5 , 1995 ) that appear to account for the broad emission seen from all three r crb stars . in the optically thick case",
    ", one expects these features to appear in absorption on the grounds that the temperatures of dust grains on clouds outer edges will decrease towards the surface facing away from the star .",
    "optically thin clouds will show emission bands associated with the increased absorption .",
    "colangeli et al.s measurements , and the temperatures found from the ` optically thin ' fit to the infrared fluxes provide a rough fit to the broad emission features .",
    "the principal goal of this investigation was to search for spectral features .",
    "such features are seen in the residual or difference spectra ( figures 2 , and 3 ) obtained by subtracting the best - fitting blackbody spectrum from the observed spectrum .",
    "emission features may be classified as ` broad ' or ` narrow ' .",

    "the temperature of 773 k was the highest temperature investigated by scott et al .",
    "a majority of the emission features seen in the laboratory spectrum are identifiable in v854 cen s spectrum : absorption at 4.3 @xmath0 m in v854 cen presumably masks the emission seen in the laboratory spectrum at a similar wavelength , and the laboratory emissions at 7.1 @xmath0 m and 12.3 @xmath0 m are not seen as distinct peaks in the stellar spectrum .",
    "apart from differences in the laboratory and stellar profiles of the 7 - 9 @xmath0 m and 11 - 15 @xmath0 m bands , there is an obvious difference in the relative strengths of these bands : the ratio of the shorter to the longer wavelength emission is much greater for the stellar than for the laboratory spectrum .    in the laboratory experiments , the intensity of the 3.4 @xmath0 m feature , characteristic of aliphatic hydrocarbons , decreased as the temperature was raised from 425 k to 775 k and the intensity of the 3.29 @xmath0 m feature , attributable to aromatic hydrocarbon and seen in v854 cen , appeared and strengthened .",

    "emission corresponding to the ch bending modes is also apparent at 12.3 and 13.2 @xmath0 m in the 773 k laboratory spectra , and in v854 cen . in short , these and other comparisons of relative intensities suggest that a laboratory spectrum at a temperature higher than 773 k , perhaps at the temperature of 1040 k of the dust shell , would prove to be an even closer match to v854 cen s narrow features .",
    "uirs seen in astronomical sources at 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath0 m are apparently absent from v854 cen , and were also reported as absent by borghesi et al .",

    "the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature was attributed to a cn - stretch of a nh@xmath7 group which owing to a lack of n in the laboratory samples did not appear in laboratory spectra .",
    "nitrogen is not especially abundant in v854 cen and , therefore , absence of this 7.7 @xmath0 m uir is likely understandable .",
    "ry sgr and r crb show broad emission features similar to those seen from v854 cen but the sharp features are exclusive to the latter star .",
    "profiles of the 7 - 9 @xmath0 m and 11 - 15 @xmath0 m bands differ from star to star . apart from the sharp features shown by v854 cen , the spectra of v854 cen and r crb are the most similar .",
    "the 7 - 9 @xmath0 m band appears resolvable into two bands with minimum flux at about 7.4 - 7.6 @xmath0 m , and the emission in the longer wavelength band does not extend beyond about 15 @xmath0 m .",
    "by contrast , ry sgr s 7 - 9 @xmath0 m band does not show the minimum , and emission in the longer wavelength band extends to about 18 @xmath0 m .",
    "these broad emission bands would appear to be a property of dehydrogenated amorphous carbon ( see koike , hasegawa , & manabe 1980 ; bussoletti et al .",
    "1987 ; colangeli et al . 1995 ) .",
    "hydrogenated amorphous carbon accounts well for v854 cen s narrow emission features .",
    "absence of strong features at 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath0 m that are characteristic of pahs suggest the free molecules are not abundant in its circumstellar shell .",
    "amorphous carbon formed in a hydrogen containing atmosphere is composed of randomly oriented linked and connected pah clusters , and , therefore , the spectrum of hac will resemble that of free pahs with bands blurred , shifted , and blended by solid state effects . by an extension of this argument",
    ", it is not surprising that an overall match to the hac spectrum is also found from laboratory spectrum of coals such as anthracite and semi - anthracite ( guillois et al .",
    "1996 ; papoular et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we suppose it more probable that hac rather than coals form in v854 cen s circumstellar shell .",
    "it is of interest to investigate the energetics of the dust clouds which we assume are heated solely by absorption of starlight .",
    "circumstellar dust is distributed in clouds around the star .",
    "after full recovery from a decline , a star always returns to the same brightness .",
    "therefore , it is plausible to suppose that at these times there is no cloud along the line of sight .",
    "although the detailed comparisons are lacking , available comparisons of observed ( corrected for interstellar extinction ) and predicted stellar flux distribution about visible wavelengths ( see asplund et al.s figure 8 1997a for r crb ) suggest that circumstellar extinction by small particles is not present at maximum light ; large particles producing gray extinction can not be ruled out by this comparison .",
    "gray extinction from a changing cloud of large particles would cause fluctuations in the brightness of a star at maximum light . if large dust particles are made in the cloud responsible for a decline , they can not persist in the line of sight once spectroscopic manifestations of a decline ( i.e. , sharp emission lines ) have disappeared in the recovery to maximum light .",
    "given these assumptions , there is a simple inequality that must be satisfied by the integrated infrared emission from the dust ( @xmath14 ) and the integrated stellar flux ( @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 denotes flux received at the earth .",
    "the inequality is @xmath17 and recognizes that ( i ) the dust clouds may be optically thin , and ( ii ) the clouds may not subtend 4@xmath18 of solid angle at the star .",
    "the dust emission , @xmath14 , is estimated as described above from the measured spectrum after subtraction of a small contribution from the star .",
    "stellar emission , @xmath15 , is estimated from published ubvrij magnitudes at maximum light with estimates added for the ultraviolet flux from _ iue _ spectra and for flux beyond j.    with the _ iso _ fluxes , we find @xmath19 for v854 cen , and 0.4 for r crb and ry sgr . the larger ratio for v854 cen may well result from the fact that we observed the star in the recovery from a deep decline when the infrared fluxes were enhanced due to a contribution from the recently formed dust cloud that caused the decline .",
    "this suggestion is consistent with forrest s ( 1974 ) observations of r crb showing that the infrared flux increased after mininum light with @xmath20 increasing from 0.2 to 0.7 , by his estimates .",
    "noting too that the _ iras _ fluxes for ry sgr were 60 - 70% higher than the _ iso _ fluxes , we suggest @xmath21 for these three stars at maximum light between declines .",
    "near - equality of @xmath14 and @xmath15 implies that the ensemble of clouds provides a covering factor approaching 4@xmath18 , and that a majority of the clouds are optically thick or almost so .",
    "given this result , it seems surprising that the stars are visible ! or to phrase this surprise in another way - are there r crb stars that have eluded discovery because they are embedded in a very optically thick conglomeration of clouds ?",
    "if the dust clouds are optically thin , the mass in amorphous carbon can be estimated readily . if the mean absorption coefficient at 7 @xmath0 m , the peak of the dust emission , is taken from colangeli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and the stellar distance derived from the stellar flux at about 1 @xmath0 m and an assumed stellar radius of 100 solar radii , the dust masses ( in solar masses ) are 2 @xmath22 , 4 @xmath22 , and 3 @xmath22 for v854 cen , r crb , and ry sgr , respectively .",
    "these are probably underestimates by a modest factor . at minimum light ,",
    "a r crb is approximately 7 magnitudes fainter than at maximum light . if the obscuring cloud covers the surface uniformly , an optical depth of about 6 at visual wavelengths exists .",
    "given the approximately inverse wavelength dependence of the dust absorption coefficient , the optical depth of the cloud at 8 @xmath0 m is about 0.4 .",
    "this estimate for a fresh cloud is likely an overestimate for the typical cloud in the dust shell .    to build a more complete picture of the clouds , imposition of radiative equilibrium",
    "is required .",
    "hartmann & apruzese ( 1976 ) were able to fit forrest s ( 1974 ) infrared photometry for infrared maximum and minimum ( both corresponding to visual maximum ) with dust distributed out to 300 to 500 stellar radii .",
    "optical depth at infrared wavelengths for the assumed dust distributions is very small .",
    "the dust mass derived of about 5 @xmath23 is larger than our estimate but this is possibly due to differences in the adopted absorption coefficients .",
    "a recalculation of model circumstellar shells of hac grains in radiative equilibrium would be of interest .",
    "dust in a cloud is reluctant to betray its identity . yet , the _ iso _ 3 - 25 @xmath0 m spectra of the ensemble of dust clouds around the stars v854 cen , r crb , and ry sgr offer a few new clues .",
    "sharp emission features coincident with certain of the uirs are present only in v854 cen s spectrum , and are a fair replica of emission seen in laboratory spectra of hydrogenated amorphous carbon .",
    "these associations are consistent with the fact that v854 cen , although h - poor relative to normal stars , is h - rich by a factor of 1000 with respect to r crb and ry sgr .",
    "spectra of all three stars show a double - peaked broad emission feature between 6 @xmath0 m and 14 @xmath0 m that corresponds to a feature in the extinction curve of amorphous carbon . in summary ,",
    "amorphous carbon is a major contributor to the infrared emission from r crb and , in the case of v854 cen , the amorphous carbon is hydrogenated .",
    "we are especially grateful to rita loidl for advice on how to reduce the _ sws",
    "_ spectra .",
