    "compact stars with strong magnetic fields are rewarding objects to study .",
    "they offer the opportunity to probe atoms under the influence of strong magnetic fields not available in laboratory experiments .",
    "furthermore , magnetic wds should give information on the origin and evolution of stellar magnetic fields from the main sequence ( e.g. ap stars ) to the final evolutionary stages .",
    "for reviews of the subject , cf . angel ( 1978 ) , koester & chanmugam ( 1990 ) , chanmugam ( 1992 ) , schmidt ( 1995 ) , and jordan ( 1997 ) .",
    "jordan lists 50 magnetic wds , but only 15 with extemely high field strengths ( @xmath3 mg ) .",
    "nearly all magnetic wds have pure hydrogen spectra , while , surprisingly , magnetic dbs have been missing so far . until very recently , the only known magnetic wd with unambiguously identified lines was feige  7 , which shows strong , magnetically split hydrogen _ and _ lines ( achilleos et al .",
    "1992 ) . however , among the high magnetic field wds there were two stars with strong unidentified features , namely and .",
    "the latter has a broad absorption feature at 5500 , and in addition a ly@xmath4 component at 1340 and a stationary h@xmath5 component at @xmath6 , suggesting a high field strength of 670 mg ( liebert et al . 1993 ; glenn at al .",
    "it was suggested that since the strong features in and can not be hydrogen , the next likely atmospheric constituent , namely he , is responsible for the broad features .",
    "very recently jordan et al . ( 1998 ) indeed have succeeded in identifying most of the features as due to in fields between 300 and 700 mg .",
    "the hamburg / eso survey for bright qsos has turned out to be a rich source of magnetic wds ( reimers et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) . due to the high spectral resolution ( @xmath7 fwhm ) of the he s objective prism plates taken with the eso schmidt - telescope , the stellar component with identifiable features ( h , he ,",
    ",  ) can be removed from the qso candidate sample ( wisotzki et al .",
    "1996 ; cf .",
    "reimers & wisotzki , 1997 , for further references ) .",
    "the fraction of non - qsos within the sample of quasar candidates for which follow - up spectroscopy is finally performed therefore contains considerable numbers of peculiar blue stars ; in particular magnetic wds , cvs , and binaries .",
    "in addition to the stars already published we have roughly 20 further magnetic wd candidates , most of them with hydrogen spectra .    in this letter",
    "we announce the discovery of seven new peculiar white dwarfs ; four of them are magnetic dbs with detectable zeeman lines .",

    "we notice , however , that the apparent temperature sequence with and as being the hottest stars while and are the coolest among the seven stars is confirmed by the colours estimated from the digitized objective prism spectra .",
    "four of the new wds have remarkably similar spectra ( fig . [ magdbs ] ) . in two of them ( and ) the features can be identified with lines split under magnetic fields of roughly 20 mg . as in case of feige  7 ( achilleos et al .",
    "1992 ) the central @xmath0 component of 5876 as well as the @xmath1 and @xmath2 components are clearly detected .",
    "the broad feature between 5000 and 5200 consists of the five @xmath0 components of 4929 .",
    "the corresponding blue shifted @xmath2 components are unresolved and are visible as broad absorption at @xmath12 , while the two @xmath1 components are seen at roughly 5270 and 5340 , respectively .",

    "the additional features between roughly 6200 and 7300 are probably due to the zeeman - triplets of 6678 and 7065 . according to the new computations of schmelcher ( priv",
    ", the two triplets cover the range longward of 6200 at field strengths of 20 mg .",
    "these features are visible as a broad , shallow absorption trough with evidence for individual lines , e.g. at 7200 ( fig .",
    "[ magdbs ] ) . at 6200",
    "there is a blending with the @xmath1 component of 5876 . at higher spectral resolution and @xmath13 the individual triplett components ( 6 lines )",
    "can probably identified .",
    "the features in the blue part of the spectra can also be attributed to he lines at similar field strengths ; partly to 4471 .",
    "so far , there is no evidence for hydrogen lines .",
    "the other two stars have quite similar spectra , although the features are weaker ( ) , or the spectrum is too noisy to show narrow , weak features ( ) .",
    "however , the gross appearance of the stronger features is rather similar : the shifted @xmath0 components of 5876 and in particular of 4929 at 5100 are detected .",
    "both stars apparently have spectra split by magnetic fields in the range of 10 to 30 mg .",
    "has an additional strong , sharp h@xmath5 emission line and is probably a binary .      besides the magnetic dbs we have found three further stars with peculiar spectra ( fig .",
    "[ unidwds ] ) , probably also magnetic non - das . has a strong feature at 4430 similar to the 4300 trough in .",
    "further features can be seen roughly at 3400 and 4000 .",
    "in addition , there is an extremely broad , shallow trough between 5000 and 5800 .    although the spectra of and look similar at first glance , jordan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) on the one hand have _ succeeded _ in identifying most of the features of as stationary transitions in a field between 300 and 700 mg , while on the other hand there is _ no _ possible match of the features in the spectrum of with in magnetic fields of up to @xmath14 mg ( becken & schmelcher , priv comm .",
    "jordan et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , even in the case of gd229 the strongest features at @xmath15  and at about @xmath16  can only be attributed to two line transitions ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , while other and weaker ones are produced by a superposition of several stationary components .",
    "therefore , jordan et al . (",
    "1998 ) speculated that additional stationary line components must be present which were not included in the current data sets for in a strong magnetic field .",
    "all available data are restricted to transitions with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath19 .",
    "we have also no identification of the shallow features in the spectra of ( at 4650 and 5800 ) and ( at 3900 , 4650 , and 6650 ) . in the former",
    ", the broad absorption troughs could be molecular bands according to their form , but we do not have an identification . apart from missing identifications , the apparently low temperature of these two objects argues against the presence of lines . we tentatively conclude that neither hydrogen nor helium give a plausible identification of the features .",
    "given the fact that except there is no db in the sample of 50 magnetic wds known today ( jordan 1997 ) , our discovery of four magnetic dbs appears surprising .",
    "the question is : why have no magnetic dbs been discovered in the course of proper motion surveys or the pg survey , with exception of ?",
    "the probable reason is the rareness of the phenomenon . with respect to the detection of peculiar blue stars ,",
    "the he s should be complete to @xmath20 .",
    "the he s follow - up observations of candidates from 280 eso / src fields , corresponding to an effective area of @xmath21 square degrees , have revealed 4 magnetic dbs . only is significantly brighter than the pg magnitude limit ( @xmath22 ) . on the same area",
    "roughly three dozens dbs have been found by the he s ( unpublished ) .",
    "although we are aware of the fact that this is still small number statistics , we tentatively conclude that the incidence of magnetism is not lower in dbs than in das .",
