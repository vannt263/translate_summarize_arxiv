    "our understanding of excitations in correlated electron systems has been strongly influenced by the seminal works of hubbard  @xcite , landau  @xcite , and pines  @xcite . in his study",
    "@xcite of the model hamiltonian that is now associated with his name , hubbard put forward one very important feature of strongly correlated electrons : the splitting of the bands into the so - called upper hubbard band ( uhb ) and the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) .",
    "its origin can be traced back to the atomic limit where a gap of the order of the interaction strength separates two sets of states , one at @xmath3 and the other one at @xmath4 .",
    "one then expects that by ramping up the hopping between the sites , the hybridization of the atomic orbitals progressively results in the delocalized states forming the dispersive lhb and uhb .",
    "however hubbard s treatment fails to produce the predicted fermi liquid for weak coupling .",
    "indeed , in this regime the self - energy he postulated neither reduces to the perturbation theory result , nor does it yield the correct fermi surface for the metallic phase  @xcite . in the latter limit landau s theory of the fermi liquid  @xcite has proved to be a successful paradigm for understanding a large variety of fermion systems at low temperature such as normal liquid @xmath5he , metals or semimetals , and nuclear matter .",
    "this phenomenological approach is based on the physical intuition that the low - energy properties of interacting particles can be modeled from a gas of elementary excitations , referred to as quasiparticles , which are formed with a life time that is infinite on the fermi surface but rapidly decays away from it .",
    "alternatively to landau s original formulation this result can be obtained within perturbation theory . using the latter to compute correlation functions within the random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    ", pines and bohm  @xcite showed that the response functions are composed of a continuum generated by the incoherent response of quasiparticles supplemented by peaks signaling collective excitations , that arise as dynamical fluctuations of the groundstate .",
    "the dispersion and attenuation of the collective modes are then indicative of the nature of the phase .",
    "prominent examples are the goldstone modes which appear when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken at a phase transition , such as phonons for rotational and translational symmetries , or magnons for the spin - rotational symmetry .    reconciling the fermi liquid with hubbard",
    "s local physics remains an important and largely unsolved problem for correlated electrons .",
    "indeed numerical approaches generically face finite - size effects  @xcite because required computing resources blow up exponentially with increasing system size .",
    "yet results can be obtained in limiting cases such as the infinite - coordination lattice where the dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite catches the hubbard gap in the vicinity of half filling .",
    "however in the doped system a clear picture is still missing , possibly because of the formation of incommensurate phases with large unit cells which can not be captured by the method and its cluster extensions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the above mentioned approaches are mainly focused on a self - consistent calculation of one - particle correlation functions , which can be directly related to experimental observations such as photoemission .",
    "however other experimental techniques require the knowledge of two - particle quantities such as the charge and spin response functions that are probed in neutron scattering experiments .",
    "computing two - particle correlations is more challenging because of the need to include vertex corrections  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to compute the charge response function of the hubbard model using an extension of the kotliar and ruckenstein slave - boson representation .",
    "one of our main results is that it reduces to the rpa susceptibility for weak coupling .",
    "the obtained charge excitation spectrum generically consists of i ) a continuum the width of which decreases with increasing interaction strength and density , ii ) a collective mode with anisotropic zero - sound ( zs ) velocity , and iii ) a high frequency mode at @xmath4 which is the signature of the uhb .",
    "hence our scheme reconciles the fermi liquid physics  including collective modes  with hubbard s local physics embedded in the split bands .",
    "the calculation is carried out in a paramagnetic phase , free of symmetry breaking , in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "it allows us to resolve the full momentum dependence of the spectra . at first glance ,",
    "neglecting magnetic instabilities puts severe constraints on the parameter range where the calculation may be meaningfully performed .",
    "however , as shown below , the incommensurate magnetic instabilities are strongly suppressed with increasing temperature , so that they essentially disappear for @xmath6 .    since mott insulating groundstates arise at large @xmath1 and at half filling , we perform our investigations in a framework which is able to capture interaction effects beyond the physics of slater determinants .",
    "we use an extension of the kotliar and ruckenstein slave - boson representation that reproduces the gutzwiller approximation on the saddle - point level  @xcite .",
    "it entails the interaction driven brinkman - rice metal - to - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "a whole range of valuable results have been obtained with kotliar and ruckenstein  @xcite and related slave - boson representations  @xcite , which motivates the present study . in particular",
    "they have been used to describe anti - ferromagnetic  @xcite , spiral  @xcite , and striped  @xcite phases .",
    "furthermore , the competition between the latter two has been addressed as well  @xcite . besides",
    ", it has been obtained that the spiral order continuously evolves to the ferromagnetic order in the large @xmath1 regime ( @xmath7 )  @xcite so that it is unlikely to be realized experimentally .",
    "consistently , in the two - band model , ferromagnetism was found as a possible groundstate only in the doped mott insulating regime  @xcite . yet , adding a ferromagnetic exchange coupling was shown to bring the ferromagnetic instability line into the intermediate coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "a similar effect has been obtained with a sufficiently large next - nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude  @xcite or going to the fcc lattice  @xcite .",
    "the influence of the lattice geometry on the metal - to - insulator transition was discussed , too  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a very good agreement with quantum monte carlo simulations on the location of the metal - to - insulator transition for the honeycomb lattice has been demonstrated  @xcite . also ,",
    "strongly inhomogeneous polaronic states that have been found in correlated heterostructures have also been addressed using this formalism applied to the hubbard model extended with inter - site coulomb interactions  @xcite .",
    "most recently the approach has been used to address possible capacitance enhancement in a capacitor consisting of strongly correlated plates separated by a dielectric  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , comparison of groundstate energies to existing numerical solutions have been carried out for the square lattice , too .",
    "for instance , for @xmath8 it could be shown that the slave - boson groundstate energy is larger than its counterpart by less than 3%  @xcite . for larger values of @xmath1",
    ", it has been obtained that the slave - boson groundstate energy exceeds the exact diagonalization data by less than 4% ( 7% ) for @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and doping larger than 15% .",
    "the discrepancy increases when the doping is lowered  @xcite .",
    "it should also be emphasized that quantitative agreement to quantum monte carlo charge structure factors was established  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we give a brief presentation of the spin - rotation - invariant ( sri ) kotliar and ruckenstein slave - boson representation of the hubbard model and the method used to calculate dynamical response functions ( more details can be found in , e.g. , review  @xcite ) .",

    "the slave - boson field corresponding to double occupancy @xmath39 however has to remain complex as emphasized by several authors  @xcite .",

    "contrary to an ordinary band insulator where thermal excitations of quasiparticle enhance the conductivity , increasing the temperature in the strongly correlated hubbard model can induce a transition from a low - temperature metal to a high - temperature insulator as thermal fluctuations destroy the poor coherence of the small-@xmath76 metallic state in a fashion similar to the transition observed in v@xmath89o@xmath90  @xcite .",

    "firstly , the collective mode appears around the energy @xmath199 with a dispersion that is vanishingly small .",

    "firstly the collective mode dispersion shrinks with increasing temperature .",
    "this results from the decrease of the saddle - point values , most notably for doping @xmath208 and strong coupling . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps0_u0 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : u0 ] the averaged kinetic energy @xmath77 , the coupling scale @xmath56 , and the inverse - mass renormalization factor @xmath63 vary significantly with temperature for this regime of parameters .",
    "however in this region of the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ) the paramagnetic solution is unstable toward phase separation or incommensurate magnetic ordering . outside this regime , where our investigation is of better relevance , the effect of temperature is a mild reduction of the amplitudes of the saddle - point values .",
    "thus increasing the temperature up to @xmath209 slightly scales down the spectrum along the energy axis .",
    "we will not discuss the regime of high temperature where the approximation of gaussian fluctuations certainly becomes insufficient .",
    "for instance we expect that incoherent multi - particle processes , which are not taken into account here , get more prominent and modify significantly the charge response of the system , as exemplified by the physics of liquid helium .",
    "the second notable effect of temperature is the broadening of the collective mode peak , which results from scattering of thermally excited quasiparticles .",
    "let us first remark that in the absence of incoherent multi - particle processes , the peak is not damped above the energy @xmath210 of the most energetic one - particle transition with momentum transfer @xmath154 .",
    "the uhb peak generally lies above it so its shape is hardly affected by increasing the temperature .",
    "this is not the case of the zs mode for small wavevectors at large doping , and in the vicinity of @xmath137 at any finite doping .",
    "the zs peak is broadened because the charge response continuum does not extend up to @xmath211 for small wavevectors .",
    "the reason comes from the fermi statistics which , at zero temperature , excludes some one - particle transitions , among which can be found the most energetic one that occurs between the states of momenta @xmath212 and @xmath213 . as a result",
    "the zs peak can be located between the continuum upper edge @xmath214 at @xmath57 and @xmath215 .",
    "increasing the temperature then smears the fermi distribution , which populates the response continuum in this energy range , and eventually broadens the zs peak .",
    "in the weak - coupling limit the charge response obtained within the slave - boson method is mostly similar to the standard hf  +  rpa result .",
    "but , as stated earlier , the former possesses a supplementary collective mode at high energy , the uhb mode . and , although the perturbation method also produces a zs mode , it fails to account for the correlation effects which strongly renormalize the quasiparticle mass around half filling and for the dynamical screening of the electron interaction .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpa_compare ] where the slave - boson charge response is compared with the hf  +  rpa response @xmath216 here @xmath217 is the charge response function of a fermi gas , _",
    "i.e. _ with no mass renormalization . at moderate coupling @xmath218",
    "the only observable difference between the two responses is the dispersionless uhb mode .",
    "the contribution of the latter is small and the weight of its peak actually vanishes in the limit @xmath181 .",
    "however at large coupling @xmath9 , the two spectra are quite different .",
    "the slave - boson response has two well separated collective modes while the perturbation method only yields the zs mode .",
    "furthermore , the continuum width and the zs dispersion shrink due to the quasiparticle mass enhancement , whereas such a correlation effect is not captured by @xmath219 .",
    "the mass renormalization is not the only effect of correlations . at large doping ,",
    "the zs peak in @xmath102 disappears around @xmath220 , in contrast to the hf  +  rpa prediction .",
    "this is because the bare electron interaction @xmath221 of the perturbation result is replaced by the complex function @xmath108 within the slave - boson approach .",
    "the latter depends on frequency and momentum , and it can have a negative real part near @xmath134 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] ) which thus suppresses the zs pole .",
    "the kotliar and ruckenstein slave - boson approach has historically been designed to reproduce the gutzwiller approximation at the saddle - point level  @xcite , thereby strongly tiding both schemes .",
    "later on , a method to calculate excitations at zero temperature has been built on the ga and the rpa  @xcite .",
    "it takes the form of the above rpa series with an effective interaction , therefore missing the physics of the hubbard split bands in the charge response function .",
    "yet a refined treatment has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we now compare to the slave - boson result .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the double - occupancy excitations for which the comparison is simplified .",
    "we note that all three terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_c - def ] ) contribute to the particle - hole continuum , implying a damping in the double - occupancy excitation spectra that is absent from the time - dependent gutzwiller approximation ( tdga )  @xcite . from a quantitative point of view",
    ", one can observe that the pole of the double - occupancy propagator found by the tdga eq .",
    "( 100 ) in @xcite is located at an energy smaller that the slave - boson one .",
    "the discrepancy is largest at @xmath220 , for small doping , and strong coupling .",
    "for instance the tdga ( slave - boson ) pole disperses from @xmath222 to 8.8 ( 7.2 to 10 ) for @xmath9 and @xmath223 , and from @xmath224 to 17.8 ( 14.6 to 20.1 ) for @xmath225 and @xmath130 .",
    "hence the excitations computed within tdga show both qualitative and quantitative differences to our results which are controlled by the @xmath55 expansion  @xcite .",
    "we have compared the charge response function evaluated with the slave - boson method to exact diagonalization ( ed ) data  @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  @xcite available in the literature .",
    "the low - temperature phase found by the numerical methods at half filling is an antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "but , as confirmed by our investigation of instabilities , the paramagnetic solution becomes predominant with increasing doping and temperature . keeping this in mind when comparing our evaluation of the charge response",
    ", we note that the spectra computed at finite doping by both numerical approaches show salient features that can be naturally explained by the two collective modes found in the present work .",
    "in particular the variations of their dispersions with the coupling and the doping qualitatively agree with the behavior we have described .",
    "ed are performed on finite clusters and the small size of the system enhances the energy level separation . as a result",
    "the obtained spectrum is a set of peaks rather than a continuous function of the frequency .",
    "the energy quantization is visible in the spectra of the charge susceptibility calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite at small density @xmath226 .",
    "they remarkably show two distinctive peaks at the energies where we have found the zs peak at @xmath227x and the uhb peak .",
    "confirming our results , the first peak is exactly in the middle of the main contribution to the momentum - integrated response , that corresponds to the continuum of single - particle excitations . as for the second peak at higher energy",
    ", we note that the dispersion of the ed computation is narrow and the peak weight is vanishingly small , which can be explained by the uhb mode found by our theory close to doping @xmath228 .",
    "the charge response function has also been computed around half filling , but for the hubbard model including hopping between next - nearest - neighbor sites  @xcite . the latter is known to break particle - hole symmetry .",
    "so the comparison with our results for the simple hubbard model should be taken with caution .",
    "one can nevertheless remark a encouraging agreement for hole doping .",
    "for the large value of coupling @xmath229 the zs - like structure at the boundary of the continuum is found to decrease in energy with increasing hole doping , which is also predicted by the slave - boson method . besides the high - energy feature moves up in energy as the uhb mode .",
    "early qmc simulations of the hubbard model have been mainly focused on the static spin and charge structure factors  @xcite .",
    "as previously discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sri slave - boson approach is in a very good quantitative agreement with the numerical evaluations of these quantities . concerning the dynamical response functions , and in particular the search for collective modes , the analysis of the qmc results meets two hurdles .",
    "indeed statistical averages computed by qmc simulations yield the values of the correlation functions on the imaginary - frequency axis .",
    "their values on the real - frequency axis are then approximated by different numerical schemes , such as the maximum entropy method , which limits the obtained frequency definition .",
    "furthermore the simulations of a doped system are restricted to the high - temperature regime @xmath230 by the sign problem . as a consequence qmc spectra may lack the necessary energy resolution to distinguish fine structures , such as several collective - mode peaks close to one another , or a peak with a small weight which is the case of the uhb mode for a large set of parameters .",
    "the charge response function of a doped system is computed in the qmc simulations  @xcite at temperature @xmath231 for coupling values @xmath8 and @xmath232 . at this temperature a sensible comparison with our theory may be made for doping @xmath233 at which the paramagnetic phase should prevail .",
    "the slave - boson results are consistent with the obtained qmc spectra .",
    "the latter show that the continuum response is strongly reduced at low doping and the intensity is mainly located beyond it , around the energies of the zs and the uhb modes .",
    "for instance for @xmath234 and @xmath9 , the intensity mainly spreads from @xmath235 to @xmath236 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the response of the collective modes that interact with the background of incoherent multi - particle processes . by increasing the doping , the uhb mode energy increases and because of its small weight",
    ", its signature can no longer be distinguished from the structureless background in the qmc spectra .",
    "meanwhile the continuum response is less renormalized away from half filling and the zs mode energy decreases .",
    "the most satisfying comparison is found with the qmc simulations of ref .",

    "we have shown that it reduces to the conventional hf  +  rpa result when expanded to lowest order in @xmath1 .",
    "they markedly depart from one another already to next order in @xmath1 .",
    "we then investigated spin and charge instabilities as well as charge collective modes of the 2d hubbard model in the thermodynamical limit . to that aim",
    "we used the spin rotation invariant formulation of the above representation . extending previous work",
    ", our calculations showed that magnetic instabilities of the paramagnetic phase essentially disappear for temperature @xmath238 , which lays ground for the computation of the charge susceptibility in this regime . in the strong coupling regime , the charge excitation spectrum splits into a low frequency branch , and a high frequency collective mode .",
    "_ en passant _ , an approximated analytical form of the latter has been derived .",
    "it applies to arbitrary lattices containing one site in the unit cell .",
    "this mode , that may not be accounted for within the conventional hf  +  rpa framework or self - consistent perturbative schemes such as flex , disperses around @xmath239 and therefore follows from the upper hubbard band .    at low energy",
    "the charge excitations form a continuum , which width scales with the quasiparticle residue @xmath63 , again in contrast to the conventional hf  +  rpa framework result .",
    "a collective mode lies above its upper boundary .",
    "the velocity of this zero - sound mode is anisotropic both off half - filling and away from the low density limit .",
    "we did not find a universal behavior in its dependence on the coupling strength , because it results from two opposite trends : on the one hand the increase of the effective mass reduces it while on the other hand the zero - sound excitation is shifted to higher energy .",
    "nevertheless some trends could be identified ; for instance it shows very small dependence on @xmath1 in the small density regime .",
    "furthermore , for small to intermediate doping , the zero - sound velocity decreases , once @xmath1 exceeds the band width . to some extend , our results could be interpreted within pines polarization potential theory .",
    "indeed striking similarities are found at low frequency when the zs and uhb modes are well split .",
    "yet the polarization potential theory does not entail a uhb mode and it therefore fails to describe the regime where the zs and the uhb modes strongly hybridize .",

    "<S> the charge dynamical response function of the hubbard model is investigated on the square lattice in the thermodynamical limit . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained charge excitation spectra consist of a continuum , a gapless collective mode with anisotropic zero - sound velocity , and a correlation induced high - frequency mode at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function is calculated from gaussian fluctuations around the paramagnetic saddle - point within the kotliar and ruckenstein slave - boson representation . </S>",
    "<S> its dependence on the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath1 and density is studied in detail . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate analytical expression of the high frequency mode , that holds for any lattice with one atom in the unit cell , is derived . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with numerical simulations , perturbation theory and the polarization potential theory is carried out . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that magnetic instabilities tend to vanish for @xmath2 , and finite temperature phase diagrams are established . </S>"
