    "metallicity gradients are characteristic of the stellar populations inside elliptical galaxies .",
    "evidences come from the increase of line - strength indices ( e.g. carollo et al . , 1993 ; davies et al . , 1993 ; trager et al",
    ". , 2000 ) and the reddening of the colours ( e.g. peletier et al . 1990 ) towards the centre of the galaxies .",
    "the study of such gradients provide insights into the mechanism of galaxy formation , particularly on the duration of the chemical enrichment process at each radius .",
    "metallicity indices , in fact , contain information on the chemical composition and the age of the single stellar populations ( ssp ) inhabiting a given galactic zone .",
    "in particular , by comparing indices related mainly to mg ( e.g. @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) to others representative of the fe abundance ( e.g. @xmath3 ) , it is possible to derive the [ mg / fe ] abundance ratio , which is a very strong constraint for the formation timescale of a galaxy . in fact , the common interpretation of the @xmath4-element ( o , mg , ca , si ) overabundance relative to fe , and its decrease with increasing metallicity in the solar neighbourhood is due to the different origin of these elements ( time - delay model , greggio & renzini , 1983 , matteucci @xmath5 greggio , 1986 ) , being the former promptly released by type ii supernovae ( snii ) and the latter mainly produced by type ia supernovae ( snia ) on longer timescales .",
    "the time - delay model applies also to other objects and the [ @xmath4/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relation depends strongly on the star formation history . for a very short and intense star burst , the [ @xmath4/fe ]",
    "ratios decrease at higher metallicity than in the solar vicinity .",
    "the contrary occurs for a very slow star formation rate like in irregular galaxies ( see matteucci , 2001 ) .",
    "pipino & matteucci ( 2004 , pm04 ) showed that a galaxy formation process in which the most massive objects form faster and more efficiently than the less massive ones can explain the photo - chemical properties of ellipticals , in particular the increase of [ mg / fe ] ratio in stars with galactic mass ( e.g. faber et al .",
    ", 1992 ; carollo et al . , 1993 ; davies et al . , 1993 ; worthey et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "moreover , from a preliminary analysis of metallicity and colour gradients , pm04 suggested that a single galaxy should form outside - in , namely the outermost regions form earlier and faster with respect to the central parts ( see also martinelli et al .",
    "1998 ) . a natural consequence of this model and of the time - delay between the production of fe and that of mg is that the mean [ mg / fe ] abundance ratio in the stars should increase with radius .",
    "we stress that the radial variation of the [ mg / fe ] abundance ratio has not been previously constrained in the study presented by pm04 . on the other hand , an inside - out formation of ellipticals , as suggested to explain the abundance gradients in the milky way ( matteucci & franois 1989 , hou , prantzos & boissier , 2000 , chiappini et al .",
    "2001 ) , would produce a decrease of the [ mg / fe ] with radius , since the outermost regions would evolve slower than the inner ones .",
    "therefore , it is very important to study the gradient of the [ mg / fe ] ratio , since this can impose strong constraints on the mechanism of galaxy formation .    in this paper",
    "we compare pm04 s best model results with the very recent observations for the galaxy ngc 4697 ( mendez et al .",
    "2005 , which also provide for the first time abundances measured from planetary nebulae ( pne ) in an elliptical galaxy ) .",
    "the high quality of the optical spectrum gives us the opportunity to study in great detail the radial variation of the [ mg / fe ] . in order to compare the observations of ngc 4697 with the pm04 model predictions , we need to adopt a suitable _ calibration _ relation to convert our predicted abundances into line - strength indices .",
    "a preliminary study of the effect of the adopted calibration on the predicted radial gradients has been included in pm04 . here",
    "we present a deeper and self - consistent study on this topic , by using the same ssps adopted by mendez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to convert their observed indices into abundances .",
    "in particular , we show that the suggested outside - in formation process is supported by mendez et al.s ( 2005 ) data , independently from the uncertainties in the adopted calibrations .",
    "moreover , we compare the radial gradients of abundances in stars as predicted on the basis of either mass - weighted or luminosity - weighted averages with observations .",
    "we show that the discrepancies arising from this comparison should be ascribed to the fact that a galaxy can not be described as a unique ssp and that , at a given galactic radius , several ssps contribute to the integrated spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly describe the adopted theoretical model ; in section 3 the predictions are compared with observations and in section 4 some conclusions are drawn .",
    "the chemical code adopted here is described in full detail in pm04 , where we address the reader for more details . in particular , being ngc 4697 a @xmath6 galaxy , we refer to pm04 s model iib for the same mass .",
    "this model is characterized by : salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , thielemann et al .",
    "( 1996 ) yields for massive stars , nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) yields for type ia sne and van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) yields for low- and intermediate - mass stars ( the case with @xmath7 varying with metallicity ) .",
    "the model assumes that the galaxy assembles by merging of gaseous lumps ( infall ) on a short timescale and suffers a strong star burst which injects into the interstellar medium a large amount of energy able to trigger a galactic wind , occurring at different times at different radii . after the development of the wind",
    ", the star formation is assumed to stop and the galaxy evolves passively with continuous mass loss .",
    "we recall here that the assumed star formation efficiency is @xmath8 , while the infall timescale is @xmath9 in the galactic core and @xmath10 at @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "these values were chosen by pm04 in order to reproduce the majority of the chemical and photometric properties of ellipticals .",
    "in particular , the radial decrease of the infall timescale is needed to reproduce at the same time both the average metallicity and colour gradients of the observed sample of ellipticals . only the predictions on the radial variation of the [ mg / fe ] ratio in stars",
    "have not been compared to the observations .",
    "we notice the all the pm04 subcases predict an @xmath4 enhancement which increases with radius , although in different amounts .",
    "this is a consequence of the galactic wind developing earlier where the potential energy is lower , as already shown by martinelli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in models _ without infall_. therefore , it depends only on the _ time delay _ and not upon specific model parameters .",
    "we recall that , at a given radius , both real and model galaxies are made of a composite stellar population ( csp ) , namely a mixture of several ssps , differing in age and chemical composition according to the galactic chemical enrichment history , weighted with the star formation rate . on the other hand ,",
    "the line - strength indices are usually tabulated only for ssps as functions of their age , metallicity and ( possibly ) @xmath4-enhancement .",
    "therefore , in order to convert the predicted abundances for a csp into indices ( especially in the case of short burst of star formation ) , it is typically assumed that a ssp with a _",
    "metallicity is representative of the whole galaxy . in other words , we made use of our knowledge about the chemical enrichment and the star formation histories to calculate either mass- or luminosity - weighted mean abundance ratios ( i.e. @xmath12,\\ , [ < fe / h>]\\ , and\\ , [ < z / h>]$ ] ) for our csps , which are then used to derive the predicted indices for our model galaxies by selecting a ssp with the same values from the compilations available in the literature . in the following",
    "we will refer to mass averaged abundance ratios between the generic elements @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the symbol @xmath15 .",
    "following pagel & patchett ( 1975 , see also matteucci , 2001 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total mass of stars ever born contributing to the light at the present time .",
    "the v - luminosity weighted abundances will be denoted as @xmath18 .",
    "following arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) , we have : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of stars binned in the interval centered around @xmath21 with v - band luminosity @xmath22 .",
    "then we define the @xmath23 $ ] ratios as @xmath24 , taking the logarithm after the average evaluation ( see gibson , 1996 ) .",
    "generally the mass averaged [ fe / h ] and [ z / h ] are slightly larger than the luminosity averaged ones , except for large galaxies ( see yoshii & arimoto , 1987 , matteucci et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "in fig . [ gradafe ] we show the predicted radial trends of both the [ @xmath25 ( solid line ) and [ @xmath26 ( dotted line ) abundance ratios versus the _ observed _ one in ngc 4697 .",
    "the latter is obtained by mendez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) by converting the line - strength indices into abundances by means of thomas et al .",
    "( 2003 , tmb hereafter ) ssps .",
    "the agreement is remarkable , especially because we did not tune the input parameters ( i.e. radius , mass ) to exactly match ngc 4697 .",
    "both the observed increase of [ mg / fe ] with radius and the slight older age ( @xmath2710 gyr ) of the outermost regions compared to the age of the inner core ( @xmath279 gyr ) confirm pm04 s model predictions , namely an outside - in formation process in which the central part of the galaxy form stars for a longer period compared to the most external regions .",
    "this can be explained in terms of galactic winds developing earlier where the local potential well is shallower ( martinelli et al .",
    "1998 ) . in fig .",
    "[ gradz ] we compare our theoretical gradient for the total metallicity z ( solid line ) with observations .",
    "the values for the inner 0.1 @xmath28 are in good agreement with observations , whereas our estimates for the outer regions are higher than the observed ones .",
    "this is because in the conversion from indices to metallicity it is adopted the approximation of one ssp and a csp has a higher ( mean ) metallicity than a ssp with the same index ( greggio , 1997 ) .",
    "this results from the metallicity distribution of stars and will be discussed further in the next section . a steeper slope ( remarkably close to the _ observed _ trend of decreasing [ z / h ] with radius )",
    "is predicted in the case of [ @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ gradz ] , dotted line ) . a better agreement with observation",
    "is also found for the predicted gradient of [ @xmath30 ( dashed line , see sec .",
    "3.2 ) .    in order to better understand the origin of this discrepancy , here we focus on the procedure",
    "typically adopted to convert line - strength indices into real abundances .",
    "first of all , we run the procedure in the opposite sense , namely we use tmb s ssps in order to transform our predicted [ @xmath31 and [ @xmath32 into line - strength indices .",
    "the results for @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "[ grad - fe ] ( we took also into account the radial age gradient suggested by mendez et al .",
    "we obtain a good agreement for the @xmath3 index , whereas the high predicted [ @xmath31 and [ @xmath25 at large radii produce a positive ( i.e. values increasing with radius ) gradient in the @xmath1 index , at variance with observations .",
    "in fact , we obtain @xmath33 mag at 0.1 @xmath28 , which is in good agreement with the observed value , but at 1 @xmath28 we have @xmath34 ( observed ) .",
    "this discrepancy was already found by pm04 in the case of the matteucci et al .",
    "( 1998 ) @xmath4-enhanced calibration .",
    "the reason for this disagreement is that the [ @xmath31 ( which accounts for the @xmath35 of the predicted @xmath1 , according to tmb ) has an almost flat gradient ( fig .",
    "[ gradz ] ) , whereas the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratio ( which contributes @xmath36 to the predicted @xmath1 ) increases with radius ( fig .",
    "[ gradafe ] ) .",
    "the use of the luminosity - weigthed values helps in obtaining a negative gradient of @xmath1 ( namely @xmath33 at 0.1 @xmath28 and @xmath37 at 1 @xmath28 ) , but the slope is still too flat with respect to the observations . as it will be shown in the next section , in fact , the use of the averages on the luminosity tends to increase the weight of the low metallicity ssps with respect to the mass - weighted averages . on the other hand , we can still recover the gradient in the fe indices ( fig .",
    "[ grad - fe ] ) because it is mainly driven by variations in the @xmath38 $ ] alone , for which we predict a decrease with radius .",
    "given the discrepancies encountered in the previous section , we further discuss what is behind the different behaviours of ssps and csps .",
    "the main problem is that , in order to transform abundances into indices , one has to select a ssp which should be the closest approximation for the predicted csp at a given radius .",
    "this is usually done by assuming that @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] are representative of the galactic zone and , then , by interpolating among the values tabulated in a suitable grid . in the case of tmb s ssp ,",
    "the relation [ fe / h]=[z / h]-0.94[@xmath4/fe ] has been adopted , on the basis of a calibration on galactic globular clusters .",
    "this relation can be explained on theoretical grounds ( tantalo & chiosi 2004 ) and holds also for the abundances in the gas of our model galaxy , but it is not necessarily true for a csp . in particular , at 0.1 @xmath28 we predict @xmath38=0.116 \\ne [ \\rm < z / h>]-0.94[\\rm < \\alpha / fe > ] = -0.18 $ ] , whereas at 1 @xmath28 we predict @xmath38= -0.145 \\ne [ \\rm <",
    "z / h>]-0.94[\\rm < \\alpha / fe > ] = -0.52 $ ] . therefore , since the ssps are calculated by means of fitting functions which depend on [ fe / h ] , this procedure introduces erroneously low fe abundances .",
    "this is a general result and depends on the metallicity distribution of the stellar populations of an elliptical galaxy , as shown by greggio ( 1997 ) for the indices in the nuclei of ellipticals . in particular , the calibration of line indices in terms of metallicity via the comparison with theoretical values for ssps ,",
    "is affected by a systematic effect if a csp spanning a substantial metallicity range is present .",
    "in fact , from fig .",
    "[ gdwarf ] it is clear that abundance ratios such as [ @xmath4/fe ] have narrow and almost symmetric distributions , which encourages to take the average value as representative of the whole csp .",
    "the robustness of the [ @xmath4/fe ] ratios as constraints for the galactic formation history is testified by the fact that @xmath40\\simeq [ \\rm < \\alpha / fe>_v]$ ] , having very similar distributions . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` g - dwarf '' plots for [ z / h ] and [ fe / h ] exhibit a higher degree of asymmetry and have a broader distribution with respect to the [ @xmath4/fe ] distribution .",
    "in particular , if we measure the asymmetry by means of the distribution _ skewness _ , measured values @xmath41 with a mean @xmath42 , the skewness is @xmath43 ; where @xmath44 is the distribution s standard deviation ( press et al . , 1986 ) .",
    "] we find that this parameter is much larger for the [ z / h ] and [ fe / h ] distributions than for the case of the [ @xmath4/fe ] one by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the asymmetry increases going to large radii , especially for the [ z / h ] distribution , in which the skewness increases by a factor of @xmath277 with respect to the inner regions .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the @xmath39 $ ] value does not represent the galaxy at large radii , and hence , we stress that care should be taken when one wants to infer the real abundances of the stellar components for a galaxy by comparing the observed indices ( related to a csp ) with the theoretical ones ( predicted for a ssp ) .",
    "only the comparison based on the @xmath40 $ ] ratios seems to be robust .",
    "another possible source of discrepancies is the fact that luminosity - weighted averages ( which are more closely related to the observed indices ) and mass - weighted averages ( which represent the real distributions of the chemical elements in the stellar populations ) might differ more in the most external zones of the galaxy .",
    "this was already shown in fig .",
    "[ gradz ] ( dashed line ) , where the radial gradient of @xmath45 $ ] is in better agreement with the observed slope .",
    "in fact , in the luminosity - weighted averages , the stars with lower metallicity have a lower mass - to - light ratio in the v - band with respect to the high [ z / h ] ones ; therefore , the luminosity - weighted averages shift towards systematically lower values than the mass - weighted ones and the difference between the true [ fe / h ] and the one obtained from the tmb calibration decreases .",
    "this is particularly true in the most external region ( see fig .",
    "[ gdwarf ] ) , at variance with the typical assumption that @xmath39\\simeq [ \\rm < z / h>_v]$ ] for sufficiently old systems , which is still valid , however , for the galaxy as a whole ( matteucci et al .",
    ", 1998 , gibson , 1996 , see sec .",
    "2 ) and for the inner regions .    beyond one effective radius ,",
    "pm04 s best model predicts that both star formation and infall timescales are so short that a flattening of the radial gradients is expected .",
    "this result seems to be in agreement with the metallicity gradient inferred from pne by mendez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , although they provide only lower limits .",
    "we hope that in the future more data from pne ( or other objects as globular clusters ) will be available in order to better constrain the process of galaxy formation by means of new and independent tools .",
    "this could be a first step towards a better knowledge of the stellar abundances , as it happens for the stars in the milky way .",
    "in fact , the use of observations coming from single objects will avoid the use of the calibration relations with all the uncertainties linked to the population synthesis modelling .",
    "we conclude by stressing that ngc4697 is a well - observed single object , whose properties have been compared to a model created to reproduce the average properties of ellipticals .",
    "we find that the agreement is remarkable .",
    "we notice that , recently , an increasing radial gradient for the [ o / fe ] ratio has been observed by proctor et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in the galaxy ngc 821 .",
    "the inferred radial trend is very similar to the one observed in ngc 4697 ( see their fig . 8) .",
    "we avoided to show ngc 821 s observations , in order not to mix data obtained with different quality and calibrations . a larger compilation of [ @xmath4/fe ] gradients is the one by mehlert et al .",
    "they suggest that , at least for ellipticals in the coma cluster , the average [ mg / fe ] gradient is zero ( although objects with gradients as high as in ngc 4697 are also present ) . on the other hand , ogando et al .",
    "( 2005 ) presented observed massive ellipticals with strong gradients ( up to @xmath46 / \\delta log ( r / r_{eff } ) = -1 $ ] ) increasing with galactic mass .",
    "these slope are steeper than the typical values found by mehlert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in their sample . for these galaxies",
    "we expect a very strong [ @xmath4/fe ] gradient , but this should still be compared by observations .",
    "massive galaxies which exhibit shallower gradients , instead , could have a prolonged formation history , perhaps affected by mergers ( e.g. kobayashi , 2004 ) .",
    "given the importance of the subject in the study of galaxy formation , and the issues arising when ssps are taken as representative of csps , we hope that wider , more accurate and homogeneous samples of [ mg / fe ] gradients will be the goal of future observational campaigns .    finally , we notice that radial variations in the @xmath4 enhancement alone can be reproduced in several ways .",
    "for example , a constant [ @xmath47 along the galactic radius can be a result of either a formation process which has a timescale independent from the galactocentric distance or by a radial change of the imf ( see e.g. martinelli et al .",
    "1998 ) . in any case",
    ", it is the whole picture coming from the largest possible set of spectro - photometric observables which helps is determining the most likely formation scenario .",
    "by means of the comparison between pm04 s best model predictions and the recent and high quality data on ngc 4697 ( mendez et al . , 2005 ) , we are able to derive some conclusions on the radial trend of abundances and abundance ratios in the stellar component of elliptical galaxies .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * pm04 s best model prediction of increasing [ @xmath32 ratio with radius is in very good agreement with the observed gradient in [ @xmath4/fe ] of ngc 4697 .",
    "this strongly suggests an outside - in galaxy formation scenario for elliptical galaxies that show strong gradients . * by comparing the radial trend of [ @xmath31 with the _ observed _ one , we notice a discrepancy which is due to the fact that a csp behaves in a different way with respect to a ssp .",
    "in particular the predicted gradient of [ @xmath31 is flatter than the observed one at large radii .",
    "therefore , this should be taken into account when estimates for the metallicity of a galaxy are derived from the simple comparison between the observed line - strength index and the prediction for a ssp , a method currently adopted in the literature .",
    "* luminosity - weighted abundances might differ from mass - averaged ones at large radii even for old ( i.e. @xmath48 gyr old ) stellar populations , at variance with what is commonly assumed .",
    "* abundance ratios such as [ mg / fe ] are less affected by the discrepancy between the ssps and a csp , since their distribution functions are narrower and more symmetric .",
    "therefore , we stress the importance of such ratio as the most robust tool to estimate the duration of the galaxy formation process .",

    "<S> we also compute the stellar distribution as a function of the [ mg / fe ] ratio , which is narrower and with a negligible _ skewness _ than those as functions of [ z / h ] and [ fe / h ] and hence can be better represented by a ssp with an abundance ratio given by the average @xmath0 $ ] ratio . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we compute the luminosity distributions of stars for a typical elliptical galaxy as functions of [ z / h ] , [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these distributions differ from the `` g - dwarf '' distributions especially at large radii , except for the one as a function of [ mg / fe ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that in ellipticals the [ mg / fe ] ratio is the most reliable quantity to be compared with observations and is the best estimator of the star formation timescale at each radius . </S>"
