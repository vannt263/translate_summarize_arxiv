    "h l    the feynman path integral in lorentz signature is schematically of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 are some fields and @xmath4 is the action .",
    "frequently , @xmath4 is a real - valued polynomial function of @xmath3 and its derivatives ( the polynomial nature of @xmath4 is not really necessary in what follows , though it simplifies things ) .",
    "there is also a euclidean version of the path integral , schematically @xmath5 where now @xmath4 is a polynomial whose real part is positive definite , and which is complex - conjugated under a reversal of the spacetime orientation .",
    "the analogy between the feynman path integral and an ordinary finite - dimensional integral has often been exploited .",
    "for example , as a prototype for the euclidean version of the feynman integral , we might consider a one - dimensional integral @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a suitable polynomial , such as @xmath8 with @xmath9 a parameter .",
    "one thing which we can do with such an integral is to analytically continue the integrand to a holomorphic function of @xmath10 and carry out the integral over a possibly different integration cycle in the complex @xmath11-plane : @xmath12 the integral over a closed contour @xmath13 will vanish , as the integrand is an entire function . instead , we take @xmath13 to connect two distinct regions at infinity in which @xmath14 . in the case at hand , there are four such regions ( with the argument of @xmath11 close to @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and hence there are essentially three integration cycles @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "( the cycle @xmath17 interpolates between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as shown in the figure . ) in general , as reviewed in @xcite , the integration cycles take values in a certain relative homology group . in the case at hand ,",
    "the relative homology is of rank three , generated by @xmath21 .     of eqn .",
    "( [ tmorf ] ) .",
    "the four cycles obey one relation @xmath22 , and any three of them give a basis for the space of possible integration cycles .",
    ", width=240 ]    .2 cm [ bairy ]    given a similar integral in @xmath23 dimensions , @xmath24 again with a suitable polynomial @xmath25 , one can analytically continue from real variables @xmath26 to complex variables @xmath27 and replace ( [ pmorf ] ) with an integral over a suitable integration cycle @xmath28 : @xmath29 the appropriate integration cycles are @xmath23-cycles , simply because what we are trying to integration is the @xmath23-form @xmath30 .",
    "of course , the differential form that we are trying to integrate is middle - dimensional simply because , in analytically continuing from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , we have doubled the dimension of the space in which we are integrating .",
    "so what began in the real case as a differential form of top dimension has become middle - dimensional upon analytic continuation .    in @xcite , it was shown that , at least in the case of three - dimensional chern - simons gauge theory , these concepts can be effectively applied in the infinite - dimensional case of a feynman integral .",
    "but what do we learn when we do this ?",
    "when one constructs different integration cycles for the same integral  or the same path integral  how are the resulting integrals related ? for one answer , return to the original example @xmath33 .",
    "regardless of @xmath13 ( using only the facts that it is a cycle , without boundary , that begins and ends in regions where the integrand is rapidly decaying , so that one can integrate by parts ) , @xmath33 obeys the differential equation @xmath34 indeed , @xmath33 where @xmath13 runs over a choice of three independent integration cycles gives a basis of the three - dimensional space of solutions of this third - order differential equation .    for quantum field theory , the analog of ( [ onox ] ) are the ward identities obeyed by the correlation functions .",
    "like ( [ onox ] ) , they are proved by integration by parts in function space , and do not depend on the choice of the integration cycle .",
    "one might think that different integration cycles would correspond to different vacuum states in the same quantum theory , but this is not always right . in some cases , as we will explain in section [ simplint ] with an explicit example , different integration cycles correspond to different quantum systems that have the same algebra of observables .",
    "in other cases , the interpretation is more exotic .",
    "the first goal of the present paper is to apply these ideas to a particularly basic case of the feynman path integral .",
    "this is the phase space path integral of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics with coordinates and momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the hamiltonian and plays a secondary role from our point of view . )",
    "integration cycles for this integral are analyzed in section [ quantint ] .",
    "there are some fairly standard integration cycles , such as the original one assumed by feynman , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being real .",
    "the main new idea in this paper is that by restricting the integral to complex - valued paths @xmath41 that are boundary values of pseudoholomorphic maps  in a not obvious sense  we can get a new type of integration cycle in the path integral of quantum mechanics .",
    "moreover , this cycle has a natural interpretation in a _",
    "two_-dimensional quantum field theory  a sigma - model in which the target is the complexification of the original classical phase space .",
    "the sigma - model is in fact a topologically twisted @xmath0-model , and the integration cycle can be described using an exotic type of @xmath0-brane known as a coisotropic brane @xcite .",
    "it has been known from various points of view @xcite that there is a relationship between the @xmath0-model and quantization . in the present paper",
    ", we make a new and particularly direct proposal for what the key relation is : the most basic coisotropic @xmath0-brane gives a new integration cycle in the feynman integral of quantum mechanics .",
    "the fact that boundary values of pseudoholomorphic maps give a middle - dimensional cycle in the loop space of a symplectic manifold ( or classical phase space ) is one of the main ideas in floer cohomology @xcite . for an investigation from the standpoint of field theory ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the middle - dimensional cycles of floer theory are not usually interpreted as integration cycles , because there typically are no natural middle - dimensional forms that can be integrated over these cycles . in the present paper , we first double the dimension by complexifying the classical phase space , whereupon the integrand of the usual feynman integral becomes a middle - dimensional form that can be integrated over the cycles given by floer theory of the complexified phase space .",
    "the relationship we describe between theories in dimensions one and two has an analog in dimensions three and four . here",
    "the three - dimensional theory is chern - simons gauge theory , with a compact gauge group @xmath42 , and the four - dimensional theory is @xmath1 super yang - mills theory , with the same gauge group . to some extent , the link between the two was made in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that to define an integration cycle in three - dimensional chern - simons theory , it is useful to add a fourth variable and solve certain partial differential equations that are related to @xmath1 super yang - mills theory .",
    "here we go farther and show exactly how a quantum path integral in @xmath1 super yang - mills theory on a four - manifold with boundary can reproduce the chern - simons path integral on the boundary , with a certain integration cycle .",
    "this has an application which will be described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the application involves a new way to understand the link @xcite between bps states of branes and khovanov homology @xcite of knots .    in sections [ quantint ] and [ zono ] of this paper",
    ", we begin with the standard feynman integral of quantum mechanics and motivate its relation to a twisted supersymmetric theory in one dimension more . in section [ reverse ] , we run the same story in reverse , starting in the higher dimension and deducing the relation to a standard feynman integral in one dimension less .",
    "some readers might prefer this second explanation .",
    "section [ cs ] generalizes this approach to gauge fields and contains the application to chern - simons theory .",
    "what is the physical interpretation of the feynman integral with an exotic integration cycle ? in the present paper , we make no claims about this , except that it links one and two ( or three and four ) dimensional information in an interesting way .",
    "a classical mechanical system is described by a @xmath43-dimensional phase space @xmath44 , which is endowed with a symplectic structure .",
    "the symplectic structure is described by a two - form @xmath45 that is closed @xmath46 and also nondegenerate , meaning that the matrix @xmath47 defined in local coordinates @xmath48 by @xmath49 is invertible ; we write @xmath50 for the inverse matrix . locally ,",
    "if @xmath45 is a closed , nondegenerate two - form , one can pick canonical coordinates @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 such that @xmath54 the poisson bracket of two functions @xmath55 , @xmath56 on @xmath44 is defined by @xmath57    in quantization , one aims to associate to that data a hilbert space @xmath58 and an algebra @xmath59 of observables .",
    "@xmath58 will be finite - dimensional if and only if @xmath44 has finite volume . in that case , to elements @xmath60 of @xmath59 , one can associate the trace @xmath61 which describes @xmath59 and its action on @xmath58 , up to unitary equivalence . in most physical applications",
    ", there is an element @xmath62 of @xmath59 known as the hamiltonian , and one is particularly interested in traces @xmath63 where for @xmath64 , @xmath65 is defined as @xmath66 .",
    "however , the basic problem of quantization ( which we set to 1 in the present paper ) and certain special cases such as quadratic functions on @xmath44 . a review can be found in @xcite . ]",
    "is to associate to @xmath44 a hilbert space @xmath58 and algebra @xmath59 , and what we will say about this problem in the present paper mostly has nothing to do with the choice of @xmath62 .",
    "we will omit @xmath62 ( that is , set @xmath67 ) except in section [ zono ] .",
    "a more incisive approach to quantum mechanics is to consider not only a trace as in ( [ zompo ] ) but matrix elements @xmath68 between initial and final quantum states @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "( this also avoids the technical difficulty that if @xmath44 has infinite volume , @xmath58 is infinite - dimensional and the traces in ( [ ompo ] ) and ( [ zompo ] ) may diverge , depending on the @xmath71 and @xmath62 . ) however , the approach to feynman integrals in the present paper is most easily explained if we begin with traces rather than matrix elements .",
    "the additional steps involved in describing matrix elements between initial and final states are sketched in section [ oose ] .",
    "the basic feynman integral represents the trace ( [ ompo ] ) as an integral over maps from @xmath72 to @xmath44 : @xmath73 here @xmath74 and @xmath75 are periodic with a period of , say , @xmath76 , so they define a map @xmath77 , or in other words a point in the free loop space @xmath78 of @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath79 are functions on @xmath44 that upon quantization will correspond to the operators @xmath80 .",
    "we have assigned a time @xmath81 to each function @xmath79 , but as we have taken the hamiltonian to vanish , all that matters about the @xmath81 is their cyclic ordering on @xmath72 . as is usual , @xmath82 is an abbreviation for @xmath83 .",
    "as written , the feynman integral depends on a choice of canonical coordinates @xmath84 and momenta @xmath51 .",
    "we could , for example , make a canonical transformation from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , replacing @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "this amounts to adding to the exponent of the path integral a term @xmath89 , where the vanishing holds because the functions are periodic in time .    rather than picking a particular set of canonical coordinates ,",
    "a more intrinsic approach is to observe that , as the two - form @xmath45 is closed , it can be regarded as the curvature of an abelian gauge field @xmath90 : @xmath91 then we can write ( [ zomp ] ) more intrinsically as @xmath92    we say that the dirac condition is obeyed if the periods of @xmath45 are integer multiples of @xmath76 . in that case ,",
    "a unitary line bundle @xmath93 with a connection of curvature @xmath45 exists and we take @xmath90 to be that connection ; its structure group is @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is called a prequantum line bundle . if @xmath96 , there are inequivalent choices of @xmath95 and quantization depends on such a choice .",
    "when @xmath95 exists , the factor @xmath97 is the holonomy of the connection @xmath90 on @xmath95 ( pulled back to @xmath72 via the map @xmath77 ) .",
    "if the dirac condition is not obeyed , the feynman integral with the usual integration cycle ( real phase space coordinates @xmath98 ) does not make sense since the factor @xmath99 in the path integral is not well - defined .",
    "we can make this factor well - defined by replacing @xmath78 by its universal cover  or by any cover @xmath100 on which the integrand of the path integral is single - valued . once we do this , the integral over the usual integration cycle of",
    "the feynman integral is not interesting because all integrals ( [ zomp ] ) vanish .",
    "( they transform with a non - trivial phase under the deck transformations of the cover @xmath101 . ) however , as analyzed in @xcite , and as we will see below , after analytic continuation , there may be sensible integration cycles ( related to deformation quantization , which does not require the dirac condition , rather than quantization , which does ) .",
    "so we do not want to assume that the dirac condition is obeyed .    in what follows",
    ", it might be helpful to have an example in mind .",
    "a simple example is the case that @xmath102 , defined by an equation @xmath103 for some constant @xmath104 .",
    "we take @xmath105 the first formula for @xmath45 makes @xmath106 invariance manifest , and the second is convenient for computation .",
    "one can verify that @xmath107 , so that the dirac condition becomes @xmath108 .",
    "however , as already explained , we do not necessarily want to assume this condition .",
    "we can think of @xmath45 as the magnetic field due to a magnetic monopole ( of magnetic charge @xmath109 ) located at the center of the sphere ; @xmath90 is the gauge connection for this monopole field .",
    "the feynman integral , as we have formulated it so far , is an integral over the free loop space @xmath78 of @xmath44 , or possibly a cover of this on which the integrand of the feynman integral is well - defined .",
    "our first step , as suggested in the introduction , is to analytically continue from @xmath78 to a suitable complexification @xmath110 .",
    "we simply pick a complexification @xmath111 of @xmath44 and let @xmath112 be the free loop space of @xmath111 ( or , if necessary , an appropriate cover of this ) .",
    "what do we mean by a complexification of @xmath44 ? at a minimum ,",
    "@xmath111 should be a complex manifold with an antiholomorphic involution @xmath113 such that @xmath44 is a component of the fixed point set of @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , we would like @xmath111 to be a complex symplectic manifold endowed with a holomorphic two - form @xmath114 that is closed and nondegenerate and has the property that its imaginary part , when restricted to @xmath44 , coincides with @xmath45 .",
    "we introduce the real and imaginary parts of @xmath114 by @xmath115 the fact that @xmath114 is closed and nondegenerate implies that @xmath116 and @xmath45 are each closed and nondegenerate .",
    "and we assume that under @xmath113 , @xmath114 is mapped to @xmath117 , so in other words @xmath118",
    "it follows that on the fixed point set @xmath44 , @xmath116 must vanish : @xmath119    we denote local complex coordinates on @xmath111 as @xmath120 , and their complex conjugates as @xmath121 , and we denote a complete set of local real coordinates ( for example , the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath120 ) as @xmath122 .",
    "since @xmath114 is a closed form , we can write it as the curvature of a complex - valued abelian gauge field : @xmath123 if the original model obeyed the dirac condition and the complexification introduces no new topology , we can regard @xmath124 as a gauge field with structure group @xmath125 ( the complexification of @xmath94 ) .",
    "in general , however , as stated in section [ relims ] , we do not assume this to be the case , and instead we replace @xmath112 by a suitable cover on which the integrand of the integral ( [ orox ] ) introduced below is well - defined .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the real and imaginary parts of @xmath124 just as we have done for @xmath114 .",
    "so we write @xmath126 where @xmath90 and @xmath127 are real - valued connections .",
    "thus @xmath128 we will slightly sharpen ( [ hem ] ) and assume that there is a gauge with @xmath129    let us describe what these definitions mean for our example with @xmath102 .",
    "we define @xmath111 by the same equation ( [ twos ] ) that we used to define @xmath44 , except we regard it as an equation for complex variables @xmath130 rather than real variables @xmath26 : @xmath131 and we define @xmath114 by the same formula as before except for a factor of @xmath132 : @xmath133 ( the factor of @xmath132 in the definition of @xmath114 is a minor convenience ; the formulas that follow are slightly more elegant if we take @xmath45 to be the imaginary part of @xmath114  restricted to @xmath44  rather than the real part . )    in addition to the conditions that we have already stated , @xmath111 must have one additional property .",
    "some condition of completeness of @xmath111 must be desireable , since certainly we do not expect to get a nice theory if we omit from @xmath111 a randomly chosen @xmath113-invariant closed set that is disjoint from @xmath44 .",
    "it is not obvious _ a priori _ what the right condition should be , but as we will find ( and as found in @xcite in another way ) the appropriate condition is that @xmath111 , regarded as a real symplectic manifold with symplectic structure @xmath116 , must have a well - defined @xmath0-model . for noncompact symplectic manifolds ,",
    "this is a non - trivial though in general not well understood condition .",
    "our example of the complexification of @xmath134 certainly has a good @xmath0-model , since in fact this manifold admits a complete hyper - kahler metric  the eguchi - hansen metric .    as for the functions @xmath79 that appear in the path integral ( [ zomp ] ) , to make sense of them in the context of an analytic continuation of the feynman integral , they must have an analytic continuation to holomorphic functions on @xmath135 ( which we still denote as @xmath79 ) .",
    "moreover , so as not to affect questions involving convergence of the path integral , the analytically continued functions should not grow too fast at infinity .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath134 , a good class of functions are the polynomial functions @xmath136 .",
    "the analytic continuation of such a polynomial is simply the corresponding polynomial @xmath137 .",
    "these are the best observables to consider , because they are the ( nonconstant ) holomorphic functions with the slowest growth at infinity .",
    "having analytically continued the loop space @xmath138 of @xmath44 to the corresponding complexified loop space @xmath110 of @xmath111 , and having similarly analytically continued the symplectic structure and the observables , we can formally write down the feynman integral over an arbitrary integration cycle @xmath139 : @xmath140 @xmath13 is any middle - dimensional cycle in @xmath110 on which the integral converges .",
    "( [ pem ] ) ensures that if we take @xmath13 to be the original integration cycle @xmath78 of the feynman integral , then ( [ orox ] ) does coincide with the original feynman integral .",
    "the reason that there is some delicacy in choosing @xmath13 is that the real part of the exponent in ( [ orox ] ) is not bounded above .",
    "the troublesome factor in ( [ orox ] ) comes from the real part of @xmath124 .",
    "( we assume that the observables @xmath79 do not grow so rapidly as to affect the following discussion . ) the integration cycle @xmath13 must be chosen so that the dangerous factor @xmath141 does not make the integral diverge .",
    "the reason that this is troublesome is that the exponent @xmath142 is unbounded above and below .",
    "for example ,",
    "the map @xmath143 multiplies @xmath144 by an arbitrary integer @xmath23 , which can be positive or negative .",
    "leaving aside the question of convergence , how can we find a middle - dimensional cycle @xmath145 ?",
    "the most elementary approach is to define @xmath13 by a local - in - time condition .",
    "we pick a middle - dimensional submanifold @xmath146 and take @xmath139 to be the free loop space of @xmath147 .",
    "in other words , @xmath13 parametrizes maps @xmath148 whose image lies in @xmath147 for all time .",
    "this type of choice can not be wrong , since if we take @xmath149 , we get back to the original feynman integral .",
    "now let us ask for what other choices of @xmath147 we get a suitable integration cycle .",
    "when restricted to the loop space of @xmath147 , the function @xmath144 must be identically zero , or the argument around eqn .",
    "( [ hefalo ] ) will again show that it is not bounded above or below .",
    "the variation of @xmath144 under a small change in a map @xmath150 is @xmath151 for this to vanish identically when evaluated at any loop in @xmath147 , we require that @xmath116 restricted to @xmath147 must vanish .",
    "is constant in each connected component of the free loop space of @xmath147 . for it to vanish identically ,",
    "we need in addition that @xmath127 is a pure gauge when restricted to @xmath147 . ]",
    "the requirement , in other words , is that @xmath147 must be a lagrangian submanifold with respect to @xmath116 .",
    "this is a familiar condition in the context of the two - dimensional @xmath0-model : it is a classical approximation to the condition for @xmath147 ( endowed with a trivial chan - paton bundle ) to be the support of an @xmath0-brane .",
    "this is no coincidence , but a first hint that the possible integration cycles for the path integral are related to the @xmath0-model .",
    "upon picking @xmath147 so that the real part of the exponent of the path integral is bounded above , we are not home free : to make sense of the infinite - dimensional path integral , the phase factor that comes from the imaginary part of the exponent must be nondegenerate . for this , we want @xmath45 to be nondegenerate when restricted to @xmath147 .",
    "in other words , @xmath147 should have some of the basic properties of @xmath44 : when restricted to @xmath147 , @xmath116 vanishes and @xmath45 is nondegenerate .",
    "we imposed one more condition on @xmath44 : it is a component of the fixed point set of an antiholomorphic involution @xmath113 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , this is needed so that quantization of @xmath44 in the sense of the @xmath0-model admits a hermitian structure .",
    "so if @xmath147 does not obey this condition , its `` quantization '' via the @xmath0-model  this operation is reviewed in section [ oose ]  is not unitary .",
    "] under these conditions , the feynman integral ( [ orox ] ) for @xmath13 equal to the loop space of @xmath147 is simply the original feynman integral ( [ uzomp ] ) with @xmath147 replacing @xmath44 . in other words , it is the usual feynman integral associated with quantization of @xmath147 .    in this situation ,",
    "different quantum mechanics problems with different choices of @xmath147 correspond to different integration cycles in the same complexified feynman integral . for",
    "a concrete example of how this can happen , let us return to the familiar example , with @xmath111 defined by the equation @xmath152 the condition on @xmath147 is that @xmath153 , or in other words @xmath154 a sufficient condition for this is that @xmath155 are all real .",
    "this brings us back to the original phase space @xmath44 . to get another example",
    ", we define @xmath156 by requiring that @xmath157 is real and positive while @xmath158 and @xmath159 are imaginary .",
    "it is not hard to see that while @xmath44 is a two - sphere @xmath134 , @xmath156 is a copy of the upper half plane @xmath160 . in quantization of either @xmath44 or @xmath156 , the observables are the same , namely polynomials @xmath137 ( modulo the relation ( [ bonkers ] ) ) , restricted to @xmath44 or @xmath156 .",
    "moreover , any identities in correlation functions of these observables ( apart from ( [ bonkers ] ) ) arise as ward identities in the path integral and are proved by integration by parts in field space .",
    "so just like the differential equation ( [ onox ] ) , the same identities hold regardless of which integration cycle we pick .",
    "so we have arrived at a pair of quantum mechanical systems  associated to quantization of @xmath44 and @xmath156  that have the same algebra of quantum observables , though with inequivalent representations .",
    "finally , we make a few remarks about this example that are more fully explained in @xcite and are not really needed for the present paper .",
    "concretely , at the classical level , the only relation that the @xmath130 obey , apart from ( [ bonkers ] ) , is that they commute .",
    "quantum mechanically , commutativity of the @xmath130 is deformed to the @xmath161 relations @xmath162=x_3 $ ] and cyclic permutations thereof .",
    "( the constant @xmath163 in ( [ bonkers ] ) is also modified quantum mechanically . )",
    "this means that the algebra of observables is the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath161  whether we quantize @xmath44 or @xmath156 .",
    "this gives a concrete explanation of why the two systems have the same algebra of observables .",
    "an important detail is that the equivalence between the algebra of observables in quantizing @xmath44 with that in quantizing @xmath156 does not map hermitian operators to hermitian operators .",
    "most simply , this is because the polynomials @xmath137 that are real when restricted to @xmath44 are not the same as the ones that are real when restricted to @xmath156 .    in footnote [ borx ] , we noted that in general @xmath147 may fail to obey one condition that we imposed on the original @xmath44 : there may not be an antiholomorphic involution with @xmath147 as a component of its fixed point set .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath156 , there is such an involution @xmath164 , acting by @xmath165 .",
    "hence @xmath156 actually obeys all of the conditions satisfied by @xmath44 .",
    "the relation between the two is completely symmetrical .",
    "we may consider @xmath111 to arise by analytic continuation from either @xmath44 or @xmath156 .      to construct more interesting integration cycles",
    ", we will use morse theory and steepest descent .",
    "a detailed review of the relevant ideas is given in @xcite .",
    "here we give a brief synopsis to keep this paper self - contained .",
    "o let @xmath166 be an @xmath167-dimensional manifold with local coordinates @xmath168 and a morse function @xmath144 . a morse function is simply a real - valued function whose critical points are nondegenerate .",
    "a critical point of @xmath144 is a point @xmath36 at which its derivatives all vanish .",
    "@xmath36 is called a nondegenerate critical point of @xmath144 if the matrix of second derivatives @xmath169 is invertible at @xmath36 .",
    "if so , the number of negative eigenvalues of this matrix is called the morse index of @xmath144 at @xmath36 ; we denote it as @xmath170 .",

    "coordinate @xmath172 ( we reserve the name @xmath173 for the time in the original quantum mechanics problem , to which we return later ) , we define the morse theory flow equation : @xmath174 the first property of the flow equation is that the morse function is always decreasing along any nonconstant flow , since @xmath175 the right hand side is negative unless @xmath176 , in which case the flow sits at a critical point for all @xmath172 . in this statement",
    ", of course , we rely on positivity of the metric @xmath171 .",

    "what is more , it is not clear what one can say about the feynman integral evaluated on a cycle associated to a critical point ( except that perturbation theory for this integral is likely to be borel - summable ) .",
    "second , for a generic hamiltonian , the flow equations lack the two - dimensional symmetry which was the main reason for the power of the analysis in section [ quantint ] .",
    "but is there a class of special hamiltonians for which the flow equations will once again have two - dimensional symmetry ?",
    "we consider this question next .      to incorporate a hamiltonian while preserving two - dimensional symmetry , we will need to consider the @xmath0-model with a superpotential .    as usual",

    ", the boundary condition must be such that @xmath1101 . here ,",
    "for any differential form @xmath1102 , we write @xmath1103 for the restriction of @xmath1102 to the boundary .",
    "( this is the restriction in the sense of differential forms , so for example if @xmath1102 is a one - form , then @xmath1103 is the part of @xmath1102 that is tangent to the boundary . ) since @xmath1104 is a multiple of @xmath1105 , to ensure that @xmath1101 , the boundary condition must be , in part , that @xmath1106 another condition comes from the fact that in the constructions of section [ gauginv ] , we want @xmath1107 and hence also @xmath1108 . to be compatible with this , the fermion boundary condition must set @xmath1109 . from eqn . ( 3.25 ) of @xcite , we have @xmath1110 , so the boundary condition must tell us that @xmath1111    when we vary the action ( [ zmonkey ] ) with respect to @xmath1091 , we get a surface term @xmath1112 the fermion boundary condition must ensure vanishing of ( [ plondo ] ) , and it must ensure the vanishing of half of the components of @xmath114 and half of the components of @xmath1091 .",
    "together with ( [ turkox ] ) and ( [ urkox ] ) , these conditions uniquely determine the boundary conditions for fermions .",
    "for example , we need @xmath1113 .",
    "( here , for example , @xmath1114 is the tangential part of @xmath1115 at the boundary ; in other words , one acts with @xmath308 before restricting to the boundary . ) in view of ( [ turkox ] ) , this implies that the boundary condition on @xmath343 is @xmath1116 and finally , in addition to ( [ turkox ] ) , @xmath1081 and @xmath1082 must obey @xmath1117      it remains to show that the boundary condition just described is elliptic for generic @xmath173 , in fact for @xmath1118 .",
    "( as explained in @xcite , the model has properties similar to those of a two - dimensional @xmath0-model for all values of @xmath173 except @xmath1119 . a boundary condition related to the one we consider by @xmath1120 is elliptic for @xmath1121 . )",
    "this is actually a straightforward exercise , the only difficulty being that the criterion for a boundary condition to be elliptic may not be familiar .    in general ,",
    "consider fields @xmath3 on a manifold @xmath795 with boundary that obey an elliptic differential equation @xmath1122 .",
    "( in our application , the operator @xmath334 is @xmath1123 , acting from differential forms of odd degree to those of even degree ; this is a standard example of an elliptic operator . )",
    "a general boundary condition is given by an equation @xmath1124 , where @xmath1125 is a linear map from the space of boundary data of @xmath3 to some linear space @xmath217 .",
    "( by boundary data , we mean the boundary values if @xmath334 is a dirac - like equation , the boundary values and normal derivatives at the boundary if @xmath334 is a laplace - like , etc . )",
    "we can assume that @xmath795 looks near its boundary like @xmath1126 , where @xmath239 is the half - line @xmath1127 .",
    "the notion of ellipticity is local along @xmath1128 , so we can take @xmath1129 .",
    "we can then also work in momentum space , that is consider wavefunctions of definite momentum @xmath1130 along @xmath1043 .",
    "a boundary condition is called elliptic if for every @xmath1131 with nonzero momentum @xmath1130 , there is a unique @xmath3 of momentum @xmath1130 that obeys @xmath1122 , decays exponentially with increasing @xmath1132 , and also obeys a shifted version of the boundary condition @xmath1133 the importance of this criterion is that an elliptic differential equation on a manifold with boundary , endowed with an elliptic boundary condition , has properties similar to those of an elliptic differential equation on a manifold without boundary . as a result , quantum perturbation theory has similar properties to those that are familiar in the absence of a boundary .",
    "( one expects the same to be true for the nonperturbative quantum theory , though this is certainly much harder to prove . )    before considering our problem , let us practice with the case of dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions for the scalar laplace equation @xmath1134 , where @xmath973 is a scalar field",
    ". let @xmath1135 be euclidean coordinates along @xmath1129 , and @xmath1132 a normal coordinate . a general solution of @xmath1134 whose dependence on @xmath1135 is @xmath1136 ( for some non - zero momentum vector @xmath1130 ) and that vanishes exponentially with increasing @xmath1132 is a multiple of @xmath1137 .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions mean that the map @xmath1125 takes a solution of the scalar laplace equation on the half - space @xmath1138 to its restriction to @xmath1139 .",
    "so the criterion for ellipticity is as follows : for any constant @xmath127 , and any nonzero @xmath1130 , there must exist a unique solution @xmath973 of the scalar wave equation , decaying exponentially with @xmath1132 , and with @xmath1140 .",
    "clearly , these conditions have the unique solution @xmath1141 , so dirichlet boundary conditions are elliptic . the case of neumann boundary conditions is similar .",
    "let us consider in the context of this definition the boundary conditions for @xmath1090 in our problem .",
    "these boundary conditions were given in eqns .",
    "( [ turkox ] ) and ( [ ozero ] ) : @xmath1142 we generalize these equations to include adjoint - valued forms @xmath1143 @xmath1144 of odd degree : @xmath1145 concretely , for @xmath1129 , we take @xmath1146 , @xmath1147 , with constants @xmath1148 , @xmath1149 .",
    "we have to show that for any nonzero @xmath1130 , and any @xmath1150 @xmath1149 , there is a unique choice of @xmath1151 , with plane wave dependence on @xmath1135 and exponential decay in @xmath1132 , obeying @xmath1152 along with ( [ zomon ] ) .",
    "since all fields have the same @xmath1136 dependence on @xmath1135 , everything reduces to algebra .",
    "the algebra can be carried out as follows .",
    "first of all , we can replace the first equation in ( [ zomon ] ) by a pair of equations saying that the difference between the left and right hand sides is both closed and coclosed ( in other words , annihilated by both @xmath371 and @xmath1153 , where @xmath1154 is the hodge star operator of the boundary ) .",
    "the complete set of conditions then becomes : @xmath1155    now , for wavefunctions of momentum @xmath1130 , we can solve the first and third equations in ( [ omo ] ) , without affecting the second one , as follows .",
    "one class of solutions of @xmath1152 is @xmath1156 with @xmath1157 as above and constants @xmath1158 .",
    "these constants can be adjusted in a unique way to satisfy the first and third equations in ( [ omo ] ) , as long as @xmath1159 or @xmath1160 .",
    "( the condition @xmath1160 is needed , since otherwise the first and third equations in ( [ omo ] ) depend on the same linear combination of @xmath9 and @xmath90 and we can not solve both equations . )    if we set @xmath1161 , the equation @xmath1152 becomes the selfdual or anti - selfdual maxwell equations , together with a lorentz gauge condition ( for a connection defined by a one - form @xmath1010 , the lorentz gauge condition is @xmath1162 ) .",
    "the selfdual and anti - selfdual equations are first order equations , so initial data are given by prescribing a gauge connection on a three - manifold .",
    "in fact , any one - form @xmath1163 on @xmath1043 can be written uniquely as @xmath1164 where @xmath1165 and @xmath1166 are coclosed and are the boundary values of solutions of the selfdual and anti - selfdual maxwell equations on @xmath1167 that decay with increasing @xmath1132 , and @xmath260 is a zero - form .",
    "shifting @xmath1081 and @xmath1168 by suitable linear combinations of @xmath1165 and @xmath1166 , we can solve the second equation in ( [ omo ] ) with fields that decay for increasing @xmath1132 .",
    "after doing this , the procedure of the last paragraph can be used to solve the other two equations .",
    "one last remark is as follows . in this appendix , we have constructed a boundary condition that is compatible with the topological supersymmetry of twisted @xmath1 super yang - mills theory and ensures that @xmath1169 is invariant , where @xmath1099 .",
    "instead , we may pick any complex number @xmath1170 with a nonzero imaginary part and ask for invariance of @xmath1171 , where @xmath1172 .",
    "@xmath1173 can be regarded as a complex - valued connection , just like @xmath1066 . in this appendix ,",
    "we have set @xmath1174 because this case seems natural in the context of the derivation in section [ gauginv ] .",
    "however , more general values of @xmath1170 are useful in the application to khovanov homology @xcite . the above derivation works for general @xmath1170 with minor modifications .    _ acknowledgments _",
