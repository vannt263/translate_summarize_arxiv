    "despite remarkable advances in the observational characterization of extrasolar planetary systems that have occurred over the last two decades , planet formation remains imperfectly understood . with the advent of data from large - scale radial velocity and photometric surveys @xcite ,",
    "the origins of a newly identified census of close - in super - earths ( planets with orbital periods that span days to months , and masses between those of the earth and neptune ) have emerged as an issue of particular interest .",
    "although analogs of such short - period objects are absent from our solar system , statistical analyses have demonstrated that super - earth type planets are extremely common within the galaxy , and likely represent the dominant outcome of planet formation @xcite .",
    "an elusive , yet fundamentally important aspect of the super - earth conglomeration narrative is the role played by orbital transport .",
    "a key question is whether these planets experience accretion _ in - situ _",
    "@xcite , or if they migrate to their close - in orbits having formed at large orbital radii , as a consequence of disk - planet interactions @xcite . although this question remains a subject of active research , a number recent studies @xcite have pointed to a finite extent of migration as an apparent requirement for successful formation of super - earths .",
    "moreover , structural models @xcite show that the majority of super - earths have substantial gaseous envelopes , implying that they formed in gas - rich environments , where they could have actively exchanged angular momentum with their surrounding nebulae .",
    "establishment of mean motion resonances in multi - planet systems has long been recognized as a signpost of the planetary migration paradigm .",
    "specifically , the notion that slow , convergent evolution of orbits towards one another produces planetary pairs with orbital periods whose ratio can be expressed as a fraction of ( typically consecutive ) integers , dates back more than half a century @xcite . while distinct examples of resonant planetary systems exist within the known aggregate of planets , the overall orbital distribution shows little preference for mean motion commensurabilities ( figure [ data ] )",
    "therefore , taken at face value , the paradigm of orbital migration predicts consequences for the dynamical architectures of super - earths that are in conflict with the majority of observations @xcite .",
    "accordingly , _ the fact that mean motion commensurabilities are neither common nor entirely absent in the observational census of extrasolar planets presents an important challenge to the present understanding of planet formation theory_.    prior to the detection of thousands of planetary candidates by the _ kepler _",
    "spacecraft , the expectations of largely resonant architectures of close - in planets were firmly established by global hydrodynamic , as well as @xmath0-body simulations @xcite . an important distinction was drawn by the work of @xcite , who pointed out that resonances can be destabilized by random density fluctuations produced by turbulence within the protoplanetary disk .",
    "follow - up studies demonstrated that a rich variety of outcomes can be attained as a consequence of stochastic forcing within the disk @xcite , and that in specific cases , turbulence can be conducive to the reproduction of dynamical architecture .    ) are available , the mass is inferred using the @xcite mass - radius relationship .",
    "such systems are shown with transparent points .",
    "the planetary multiplicity , @xmath4 , is color - coded in the following way : systems with 2 , 3 , and 4 planets are shown with black , blue and red points respectively .",
    "systems with 5 or more planets are depicted with green points . in planetary systems with more than two planets ,",
    "only period ratios of neighboring planets are considered .",
    "vertical lines denote the locations of first - order mean motion resonances .",
    "the overall sample clearly shows little preference for orbital commensurabilities . ]    while the prediction of the infrequency of resonant systems made by @xcite was confirmed by the _ kepler _",
    "dataset , recent work has shown that turbulent forcing is not the only mechanism through which resonances can be disrupted . specifically , the work of @xcite proposed that a particular relationship between the rates of eccentricity damping and semi - major axis decay can render resonances metastable , while @xcite showed that probability of resonance capture can be dramatically reduced in slightly non - axisymmetric disks . in light of the ambiguity associated with a multitude of theoretical models that seemingly",
    "accomplish the same thing , it is of great interest to inquire which , if any , of the proposed mechanisms plays the leading role in sculpting the predominantly non - resonant architectures of known exoplanetary systems .    within the context of the aforementioned models of resonant metastability and capture suppression , the necessary conditions for passage through commensurability are relatively clear .",
    "resonant metastability requires the outer planet to be much more massive than the inner planet @xcite , while the capture suppression mechanism requires disk eccentricities on the order of a few percent to operate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the complex interplay between planet - planet interactions , turbulent forcing , and dissipative migration remains poorly quantified , making the turbulent disruption mechanism difficult to decisively confirm or refute ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "a key goal of this work is to identify the regime of parameter space for which the stochastic dissolution of mean motion resonances can successfully operate . in doing so",
    ", we aim to gain insight into the evolutionary stages of young planetary systems during which disk turbulence can prevent the formation of resonant pairs of planets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect2 ]",
    ", we present the details of our model . in section [ sect3 ] , we employ methods from stochastic calculus to derive an analytic criterion for turbulent disruption of mean motion resonances . in section [ sect4 ] , we confirm our results with both perturbative numerical integrations and an ensemble of full @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the paper concludes in section [ sect5 ] with a summary of our results and a discussion of their implications .",
    "the model we aim to construct effectively comprises three ingredients : ( 1 ) first - order ( @xmath5 ) resonant planet - planet interactions , ( 2 ) orbital migration and damping , as well as ( 3 ) stochastic turbulent forcing . in this section ,",
    "we outline our treatment of each of these processes .",
    "a cartoon depicting the geometric setup of the problem is shown in figure [ setup ] . throughout much of the manuscript",
    ", we make the so - called  compact \" approximation , where we assume that the semi - major axis ratio @xmath6 . while formally limiting , the agreement between results produced under this approximation and those obtained within @xmath0-body integrations is well - known to be satisfactory , particularly for @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where the integer @xmath8 specifies the resonance @xcite .",
    "being made up of analytic components , the model constructed here can not possibly capture all of the intricate details of the dynamical evolution that planets are subjected to , within protoplanetary disks . by sacrificing precision on a detailed level ,",
    "however , we hope to construct an approximate description of the relevant physical processes that will illuminate underlying relationships .",
    "these findings can then be used to constrain the overall regime over which turbulent fluctuations can effect the dynamical evolution of nascent planetary systems .      in the late twentieth century",
    ", it was recognized that a perturbative hamiltonian that represents the motion of a massive pair of planets residing on eccentric orbits , in the vicinity of a mean - motion commensurability , can be cast into integrable form @xcite .",
    "more recently , this formalism has been used to provide a geometric representation of resonant dynamics @xcite , study the onset of chaos @xcite , generalize the theory of resonant capture @xcite , as well as to elucidate overstable librations @xcite .",
    "a key advantage of this treatment is that it translates the full , unrestricted three - body problem into the same mathematical form as that employed for the well - studied circular restricted problem @xcite . here , we make use of this framework once again .",
    "because detailed derivations of the aforementioned resonant normal form are spelled out in the papers quoted above , we will not reproduce it here , and instead restrict ourselves to employing the results .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes planet - planet interactions in the vicinity of a @xmath5 mean motion resonance can be written as follows : @xmath9 where the variables @xmath10 are defined below .",
    "a hamiltonian of this form is typically referred to as the second fundamental model for resonance @xcite , and behaves as a forced harmonic oscillator at negative values of the proximity parameter , @xmath11 , while possessing a pendulum - like phase - space structure at large positive values of @xmath11 .",
    "this integrable model approximates the real @xmath0-body dynamics at low eccentricities and inclinations , and formally assumes that the orbits do not cross , although this latter assumption is routinely violated without much practical consequence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the well - studied case of the restricted circular three - body problem , the canonical variables @xmath12 are connected to the test particle s eccentricity and the resonant angle , while @xmath11 is a measure of how close the orbits are to exact resonance . within the framework of the full planetary resonance problem ( where neither mass nor eccentricity of either secondary body is assumed to be null ) ,",
    "the variables take on slightly more complex physical meanings .    in order to convert between keplerian orbital elements and the dimensionless canonical variables used here",
    ", we first define a generalized composite eccentricity @xmath13 where subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 refer to the inner and outer planets respectively , @xmath16 is eccentricity , and @xmath17 is the longitude of periastron .",
    "additionally , we define units of action and time according to @xmath18= \\frac{1}{2 } \\bigg ( \\frac{15}{4 }   \\frac{k\\,m}{m_1+m_2 } \\bigg)^{2/3 } \\nonumber \\\\ & [ t ] = \\frac{1}{n}\\bigg(\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{6}\\,k^2 }   \\frac{m}{m_1+m_2}\\bigg)^{2/3 } , \\label{atunits}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is planetary mass , @xmath20 is stellar mass , and @xmath21 is the mean motion .",
    "then , in the compact limit , the variables in the hamiltonian become @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and the quantity @xmath24\\ ] ] represents a generalized longitude of perihelion .     and",

    "the bodies are immersed in a gaseous nebula with scale - height @xmath27 and a nominal local surface density @xmath28 .",
    "tidal interactions between the planets and the disk act to damp the planetary eccentricities on a timescale @xmath29 , while facilitating orbital convergence on a timescale @xmath30 .",
    "simultaneously , turbulent density fluctuations within the nebula generate stochastic perturbations to the planetary orbits , where the fluctuations are described by a diffusion coefficient @xmath31 . ]",
    "the specification of resonant dynamics is now complete .",
    "while application of hamilton s equations to equation ( [ hammy ] ) only yields the evolution of @xmath32 and the corresponding resonant angle , the behavior of the individual eccentricities and apsidal lines can be obtained from the conserved , @xmath33 is no longer a strictly conserved quantity .",
    "instead , @xmath33 becomes an adiabatic invariant that is nearly constant , except when the system encounters a homoclinic curve @xcite .",
    "] quantity @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , we note that the definitions of the variables ( [ aacoords ] ) are independent of the individual planetary masses @xmath35 , and depend only on the cumulative planet - star mass ratio @xmath36 .",
    "this apparent simplification is a consequence of taking the limit @xmath6 , and is qualitatively equivalent to the pik approximation @xcite .",
    "dating back to early results on ring - satellite interactions @xcite , it has been evident that planets can exchange orbital energy and angular momentum with their natal disks . for planets that are not sufficiently massive to open gaps within their nebulae",
    ", this exchange occurs through local excitation of spiral density waves ( i.e. , the so - called  type - i \" regime ) , and proceeds on the characteristic timescale : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the local surface density , and @xmath39 is the aspect ratio of the disk . for an isothermal equation of state and a surface density profile that scales inversely with the orbital radius @xcite ,",
    "the corresponding rates of eccentricity and semi - major axis decay are given by @xcite : @xmath40 a different , routinely employed approach to modeling disk - driven semi - major axis evolution is to assume that it occurs on a timescale that exceeds the eccentricity decay time by a numerical factor @xmath41 . to this end",
    ", we note that the value of @xmath42 adopted by many previous authors @xcite is in rough agreement with equation ( [ migdamp ] ) which yields @xmath43 .",
    "while eccentricity damping observed in numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) is well matched by equation ( [ migdamp ] ) , state - of - the - art disk models show that both the rate and direction of semi - major axis evolution can be significantly affected by entropy gradients within the nebula @xcite .",
    "although such corrections alter the migration histories on a detailed level , convergent migration followed by resonant locking remains an expected result in laminar disks @xcite . for simplicity , in this work , we account for this complication by introducing an adjustable parameter @xmath44 into equation ( [ migdamp ] ) .",
    "in addition to acting as sources of dissipation , protoplanetary disks can also drive stochastic evolution .",
    "in particular , density fluctuations within a turbulent disk generate a random gravitational field , which in turn perturbs the embedded planets @xcite .",
    "such perturbations translate to effectively diffusive evolution of the eccentricity and semi - major axis @xcite . in the ideal limit of mri - driven turbulence ,",
    "the corresponding eccentricity and semi - major axis diffusion coefficients can be constructed from analytic arguments ( e.g. , see @xcite ) to obtain the expressions @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the shakura - sunayev viscosity parameter @xcite . although non - ideal effects can modify the above expressions on the quantitative level @xcite , for the purposes of our simple model we neglect these explicit corrections .",
    "we note , however , that such details can be trivially incorporated into the final answer by adjusting the value of @xmath46 accordingly .",
    "with all components of the model specified , we now evaluate the stability of mean motion resonances against stochastic perturbations . in order to obtain a rough estimate of the interplay between turbulent forcing , orbital damping , and resonant coupling",
    ", we can evaluate the diffusive progress in semi - major axis and eccentricity against the width of the resonance . specifically , the quantities , whose properties we wish to examine are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "keep in mind that this latter quantity is directly proportional to the generalized eccentricity @xmath32 ( see equation [ [ aacoords ] ] ) .      in the compact limit @xmath49",
    ", the time evolution of the parameter @xmath50 can be written in the approximate form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a representative average semi - major axis .",

    "additionally , for comparable - mass planets , we may adopt @xmath56 as a characteristic drift rate , replacing @xmath19 with @xmath57 in equation ( [ migdamp ] ) .",
    "note that this assumption leads to the maximum possible rate of orbital convergence .    with these constituents ,",

    "simultaneously , for computational convenience , the semi - major axis of the inner planet was re - normalized to @xmath139au at every time step . the characteristic timescales @xmath30 and @xmath29 were kept constant , given by equation ( [ migdamp ] ) , adopting identical physical parameters of the disk to those employed above .",
    "finally , following previous treatments @xcite , turbulent fluctuations were introduced into the equations of motion through random velocity kicks , whose amplitude was tuned such that the properties of the diffusive evolution of an undamped isolated orbit matched the coefficients from equation ( [ diffcoeff ] ) . for completeness , we have also included the leading order corrections due to general relativity @xcite .    as in the previous sub - section",
    ", we computed the orbital evolution of three representative cases with mass ratios @xmath130 and @xmath96 ( corresponding to migration timescales of @xmath140 , and @xmath141 years respectively ) over a time span of @xmath142myr .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figure [ nbodyfig ] , and show excellent agreement with the analytic criterion from equation ( [ criterionchi ] ) . in particular , the system with mass ratio @xmath121 exhibits long - term stable capture into a 3:2 mean motion resonance , as exemplified by the ensuing low - amplitude libration of the resonant angles @xmath131[3:2 ] = @xmath143 and @xmath133[3:2 ] = @xmath134 , shown in red and blue in the bottom panel of figure [ nbodyfig ] .",
    "correspondingly , both the period ratio ( top panel ) and the eccentricities ( middle panel ) rapidly attain their resonant equilibrium values , and remain essentially constant throughout the simulation .",
    "the case with mass ratio @xmath100 , for which equation ( [ criterionchi ] ) yields @xmath144 , perfectly exemplifies the transitory regime . as shown in the top panel of figure [ nbodyfig ] , where this experiment is represented in gray ,",
    "the system exhibits temporary capture into the 3:2 as well as the 4:3 commensurabilities , and subsequently locks into a meta - stable 7:6 resonance at time @xmath145 years .",
    "although evolution within this resonance is relatively long - lived , the bottom panel of figure [ nbodyfig ] shows that the corresponding resonant angles @xmath131[7:6 ] = @xmath135 ( green ) and @xmath133[7:6 ] = @xmath134 ( gray ) maintain large amplitudes of libration , due to the nearly perfect balance between orbital damping and turbulent excitation . as a result ,",
    "the system eventually breaks out of its resonant state . after a period of chaotic scattering ,",
    "the orbits switch their order , and the period ratio increases .    finally , the case with mass ratio @xmath122 represents a system that never experiences resonant locking .",
    "as the period ratio evolves towards unity ( purple curve in the top panel ) , encounters with mean motion commensurabilities only manifest themselves as impulsive excitations of the orbital eccentricities ( purple / orange curves in the middle panel ) of the planets . as such , the planets eventually experience a brief phase of close encounters , and subsequently re - enter an essentially decoupled regime , after the orbits reverse .",
    "we note that because turbulence introduces a fundamentally stochastic component into the equations of motion , each realization of the @xmath0-body simulations is quantitatively unique .",
    "however , having carried out tens of integrations for each set of parameters considered in figure [ nbodyfig ] , we have confirmed that the presented solutions are indeed representative of the evolutionary outcomes . as a result",
    ", we conclude that the analytic expression ( [ criterionchi ] ) represents an adequate description of the requirement for resonance disruption , consistent with the numerical experiments .",
    "while resonant locking is an expected outcome of migration theory @xcite , the current sample of exoplanets shows only a mild tendency for systems to be near mean motion commensurabilities @xcite .",
    "motivated by this observational finding , this paper derives an analytic criterion for turbulent disruption of planetary resonances and demonstrates its viability through numerical integrations .",
    "our specific results are outlined below ( section [ summary ] ) , followed by a conceptual interpretation of the calculations ( section [ concept ] ) , and finally a discussion of the implications ( section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is the derivation of the constraint necessary for turbulent fluctuations to compromise mean motion resonance ( given by equation [ [ criterionchi ] ] ) .",
    "this criterion exhibits a strong dependence on the ratio of planetary mass to stellar mass , but also has significant dependence on the local surface density .",
    "that is , turbulence can successfully disrupt mean motion resonances only for systems with sufficiently small mass ratios and/or large surface densities ( see figure [ critfig ] ) .",
    "the analytic estimate ( [ criterionchi ] ) for the conditions required for turbulence to remove planet pairs from resonance has been verified by numerical integrations . to this end , we have constructed a model of disk - driven resonant dynamics in the perturbative regime , and have calculated the time evolution of the resonance promiximity parameter @xmath11 ( section [ perturb ] ) .",
    "the results confirm the analytical prediction that given nominal disk parameters , systems with mass ratios smaller than @xmath146 are forced out of resonance by turbulence , whereas systems with larger mass ratios survive ( figure [ delta ] ) .",
    "we have also performed full @xmath0-body simulations of the problem ( section [ nbody ] ) .",
    "these calculations further indicate that planetary systems with small mass ratios are readily moved out of resonance by turbulent fluctuations , whereas systems with larger mass ratios are not ( figure [ nbodyfig ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the purely analytic treatment , simulations performed within the framework of perturbation theory , and the full @xmath0-body experiments all yield consistent results .    for circumstellar disks with properties comparable to the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite , the results of this paper suggest that compact _ kepler_-type planetary systems are relatively close to the border - line for stochastic disruption of primordial mean motion commensurabilities .",
    "nonetheless , with a cumulative mass ratio that typically lies in the range of @xmath147 ( figure [ data ] ) , the majority of these planets are sufficiently massive that their resonances can survive in the face of turbulent disruption , provided that the perturbations operate at the expected amplitudes ( this result also assumes that the stochastic fluctuations act over a time scale that is comparable to the migration time ) .    given critical combinations of parameters ( for which equation [ [ criterionchi ] ] evaluates to a value of order unity ) ,",
    "resonant systems can ensue , but they routinely come out of the disk evolution phase with large libration amplitudes .",
    "this effect has already been pointed out in previous work @xcite , which focused primarily on numerical simulations with limited analytical characterization .",
    "importantly , this notion suggests that the stochastic forcing mechanism may be critical to setting up extrasolar planetary systems like gj876 and _ kepler_-36 that exhibit rapid dynamical chaos @xcite .",
    "although this work has mainly focused on the evolution of sub - jovian planets , we can reasonably speculate that turbulent fluctuations are unlikely to strongly affect mean motion resonances among giant planets .",
    "in addition to having mass ratios well above the critical limit , the influence that the disk exerts on large planets is further diminished because of gap - opening @xcite . however , one complication regarding this issue is that the damping rate of eccentricity is also reduced due to the gap ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since both the excitation and damping mechanisms are less effective in the gap - opening regime , a minority of systems could in principle allow for excitation to dominate .",
    "the analysis presented herein yields a practical measure that informs the outcome of dynamical evolution of multi - planetary systems embedded in turbulent protoplanetary disks . while numerical experiments confirm that the analytic theory indeed provides an acceptable representation of perturbed @xmath0-body dynamics , the phenomenological richness inherent to the problem calls for an additional , essentially qualitative account of the results .",
    "this is the purpose of the following discussion .    within the framework of our most realistic description of the relevant physics ( i.e. , the @xmath0-body treatment ) ,",
    "the effect of turbulent fluctuations is to provide impulsive changes to the planet velocities .",
    "the turbulence has a coherence time of order one orbital period , so that the fluctuations provide a new realization of the random gravitational field on this time scale @xcite . with these impulses , the orbital elements of the planets , specifically the semi - major axis @xmath148 and eccentricity @xmath16 ,",
    "execute a random walk .",
    "in other words , as the elements vary , the changes in @xmath148 and @xmath16 accumulate in a diffusive manner @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the interactions between planets and the spiral density waves they induce in the nebula lead to smooth changes in the orbital periods , as well as damping of the planetary eccentricities @xcite .",
    "in contrast with aforementioned disk - driven effects , the bandwidth of a planetary resonance is typically described in terms of maximal libration amplitude of a critical angle @xmath131 that obeys dalembert rules ( e.g. , see chapter 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the conceptual difficulty lies in connecting how the extrinsic forcing of orbital elements translates to the evolution of this angle . within the framework of our theoretical model , this link",
    "is enabled by the hamiltonian model of mean motion resonance ( equation [ [ hammy ] ] ; @xcite ) .    in the parameter range relevant to the problem at hand ,",
    "the behavior of hamiltonian ( [ hammy ] ) is well - approximated by that of a simple pendulum @xcite .",
    "specifically , the equilibrium value of @xmath11 dictates the value of the pendulum s action , @xmath149 , at which zero - amplitude libration of the angle @xmath131 can occur , as well as the location of the separatrix .",
    "correspondingly , oscillation of the angle @xmath131 translates to variations of the action @xmath149 , which is in turn connected to the eccentricities ( equations [ [ aacoords ] ] ) as well as the semi - major axes , through conservation of the generalized tisserand parameter @xcite .    in this picture",
    ", there are two ways to drive an initially stationary pendulum to circulation : one is to perturb the ball of the pendulum directly ( thereby changing the energy - level of the trajectory ) , and the other is to laterally rock the base ( thus modulating the separatrix along the @xmath149-axis ) .",
    "these processes are directly equivalent to the two types of diffusion considered in our calculations .",
    "that is , [ 1 ] diffusion in the dynamic variables @xmath48 and @xmath85 themselves ( explicitly connected to eccentricities and resonant angle ) is analogous to direct perturbations to the ball of the pendulum , while [ 2 ] diffusion in the proximity parameter @xmath11 ( explicitly connected to the semi - major axes ) corresponds to shaking the base of the pendulum back and forth .",
    "meanwhile , consequences of eccentricity damping and convergent migration are equivalent to friction that acts to return the ball of the pendulum back to its undisturbed state , and restore the separatrix to its equilibrium position , respectively .",
    "in the type - i migration regime however , eccentricity damping by the disk is far more efficient than orbital decay @xcite , meaning that the ball of the pendulum is effectively submerged in water , while the base of the pendulum is only subject to air - resistance ( in this analogy ) . as a result",
    ", the latter process  diffusion in proximity parameter @xmath11  ends up being more important for purposes of moving planets out of mean motion resonance ( see equation [ [ avse ] ] ) .",
    "the work presented herein suggests that turbulent forcing is unlikely to be the single dominant effect that sculpts the final orbital distribution of exoplanets . at the same time , the functional form of expression ( [ criterionchi ] ) yields important insight into the evolutionary aspects of the planet formation process .",
    "particularly , because the resonance disruption criterion depends on the disk mass , it implies a certain time - dependence of the mechanism itself ( as the nebula dissipates , the critical mass ratio below which the mechanism operates decreases from a value substantially above the earth - sun mass ratio , to one below ) .",
    "this means that even though the turbulent disruption mechanism becomes ineffective in a weaning nebula , it may be key to facilitating growth in the early stages of evolution of planetary systems , by allowing pairs of proto - planets to skip over mean - motion commensurabilities and merge , instead of forming resonant chains . in essence , this type of dynamical behavior is seen in the large - scale numerical experiments of @xcite .    for much of this work ,",
    "the system parameters that we use effectively assume a maximum rate of orbital convergence . because the quantitative nature of migration can change substantially in the inner nebula",
    ", the actual rate of orbital convergence may be somewhat lower .",
    "this change would make planetary resonances more susceptible to stochastic disruption . at the same time , we have not taken into account the inhibition of the random gravitational field through non - ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects @xcite , which would weaken the degree of stochastic forcing .",
    "both of these effects can be incorporated into the criterion of equation ( [ criterionchi ] ) by lowering the migration factor @xmath44 and the value of @xmath46 accordingly .",
    "however , because both of these quantities appear under a square root in the expression , the sensitivity of our results to these corrections is not expected to be extreme .",
    "this work assumes that turbulence operates in circumstellar disks at the expected levels .",
    "the presence of turbulence is most commonly attributed to the magneto - rotational - instability @xcite , which in turn requires the disk to be sufficiently ionized .",
    "although the innermost regions of the disk are expected to be ionized by thermal processes , dead zones could exist in intermediate part of the disk ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , and ionization by cosmic rays can be suppressed in the outer disk @xcite .",
    "indeed , suppressed levels of ionization are now inferred from alma observations of young star / disk systems @xcite , implying that the assumption of sufficient ionization  and hence active mri turbulence  is not guarenteed . at the same time , our model is agnostic towards the origins of turbulent fluctuations themselves , and can be employed equally well if a purely hydrodynamic source of turbulence were responsible for angular momentum transport within the nebula @xcite .    in light of the aforementioned uncertainties inherent to the problem at hand , it is of considerable interest to explore if simply adjusting the parameters can , in principle , yield consistency between the model and the observations .",
    "that is , can reasonable changes to the migration rate , etc . , generate agreement between the turbulent resonance disruption hypothesis and the data ? using equation ( [ criterionchi ] ) , we find that increasing the local surface density by an order of magnitude ( @xmath150g/@xmath151 ) while lowering the orbital convergence rate a hundred - fold ( @xmath152 ) and retaining @xmath67 , @xmath153au , @xmath154 yields @xmath155 as the critical mass ratio , thus explaining the full range of values shown in figure [ data ] .",
    "correspondingly , rough agreement between observations and the stochastic migration scenario is reproduced in the work of @xcite , where the amplitude of turbulent forcing was tuned to give consistency with data .",
    "although this line of reasoning may appear promising , it is important to note that as the disk accretes onto the star , the local surface density will diminish , causing the critical mass ratio to decrease as well . meanwhile , even with a reduction factor of @xmath152 , the type - i migration timescale remains shorter than the @xmath156few myr lifetime of the nebula , as long as @xmath157g/@xmath151 . as a result",
    ", we argue that any realistic distribution of the assumed parameters is unlikely to allow turbulence to provide enough resonance disruption to explain the entire set of observations .",
    "if disk turbulence does not play the defining role in generating an observational census of extrasolar planets that is neither dominated by , nor devoid of , mean motion resonances , than what additional processes are responsible for the extant data set ?",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , there are two other ways in which planets can avoid resonant locking  resonant metastability @xcite and capture probability suppression @xcite .",
    "the first mechanism requires that the outer planet is more massive then the inner planet to compromise resonance @xcite . as a result , observed resonant systems would almost always have a more massive inner planet , but this ordering is not reflected in the data .",
    "on the other hand , the ( second ) capture suppression mechanism requires disk eccentricities of order @xmath158 to explain the data .",
    "importantly , disk eccentricities of this magnitude ( and greater ) are not only an expected result of theoretical calculations , they are invoked to explain observations of asymmetric glow of dust @xcite .    in conclusion , turbulent fluctuations",
    "probably do not explain the entire ensemble of observed planetary systems , which exhibit only a weak preference for mean motion commensurability .",
    "in addition to turbulent forcing , many other physical processes are likely at work , where perhaps the most promising mechanism is capture suppression due to nonzero disk eccentricities . nonetheless , a subset of exotic planetary systems that exhibit large - amplitude resonant librations likely require a turbulent origin .",
    "the relative duty cycle of this mechanism , and others , poses an interesting problem for further exploration .",
