    "the search for the higgs boson and , hence , for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation , remains one of the premier tasks of present and future high energy physics experiments .",
    "fits to precision electroweak ( ew ) data have for some time suggested a relatively small higgs boson mass , of order 100  gev  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the search for an intermediate mass higgs boson is particularly important  @xcite .    for the intermediate mass range ,",
    "most of the literature has focussed on higgs boson production via gluon fusion  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite or @xmath8  @xcite associated production .",
    "cross sections for standard model ( sm ) higgs boson production at the lhc are well - known  @xcite , and while production via gluon fusion has the largest cross section by almost one order of magnitude , there are substantial qcd backgrounds .",
    "a search for the very clean four - lepton signature from @xmath9 decay can find a higgs boson in the mass region @xmath10  gev , but due to the small branching fraction of this mode very large integrated luminosities , up to 100  fb  @xmath5 or more , are required .",
    "one can search for @xmath11 via @xmath12 decays with much lower luminosity  @xcite , but with lower signal - to - background ratios .",
    "the second largest production cross section is predicted for weak - boson fusion ( wbf ) , @xmath13 .",
    "these events contain additional information in their observable quark jets .",
    "techniques like forward jet tagging  @xcite can then be exploited to significantly reduce the backgrounds .",
    "wbf and gluon fusion nicely complement each other : together they allow for a measurement of the @xmath14 coupling ratio .",
    "another feature of the wbf signal is the lack of color exchange between the initial - state quarks .",
    "color coherence between initial- and final - state gluon bremsstrahlung leads to suppressed hadron production in the central region , between the two tagging - jet candidates of the signal  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to most background processes , which typically involve color exchange in the @xmath15-channel and thus lead to enhanced hadronic activity between the tagging jets .",
    "we exploit these features , via a veto of soft jet activity in the central region  @xcite .",
    "while some attention has been given to intermediate - mass @xmath16 searches at the lhc in the framework of gluon fusion  @xcite , production via weak boson fusion for the same decay mode has not yet been discussed in the literature .",
    "thus , we provide a first analysis of intermediate - mass @xmath17 at the lhc ( and of the main physics and reducible backgrounds ) which demonstrates the feasibility of higgs boson detection in this channel , with very low luminosity . @xmath16",
    "event characteristics are analyzed for dual leptonic decays to @xmath18 only , to avoid backgrounds from @xmath19 .",
    "our analysis is a parton - level monte carlo study , using full tree - level matrix elements for the wbf higgs signal and the various backgrounds . in section  [ sec : calc ]",
    "we describe our calculational tools , the methods employed in the simulation of the various processes , and important parameters .",
    "extra minijet activity is simulated by adding the emission of one extra parton to the basic signal and background processes .",
    "generically we call the basic signal process ( with its two forward tagging jets ) and the corresponding background calculations `` 2-jet '' processes , and refer to the simulations with one extra parton as `` 3-jet '' processes . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , using the 2-jet programs for the backgrounds , we demonstrate forward jet tagging , a @xmath20 veto and other important cuts which combine to yield an @xmath212/1 to 1/2 signal - to - background ( s / b ) ratio , depending on the higgs mass .    in section  [ sec : minijet ] we analyze the different minijet patterns in signal and background , using both the truncated shower approximation ( tsa )  @xcite to regulate the cross sections , and the gluon exponentiation model to estimate the minijet multiplicity  @xcite . by exploiting the two most important characteristics of the extra radiation , its angular distribution and its hardness ,",
    "the qcd backgrounds can be suppressed substantially by a veto on extra central jet emission . within the tsa and exponentiation models ,",
    "probabilities are estimated for vetoing signal and background events , and are combined with the production cross sections of the previous section to predict signal and background rates in table  [ summary ] .",
    "these rates demonstrate the feasibility of extracting a very low background @xmath16 signal at the lhc .",
    "our signal selection is not necessarily optimized yet .",
    "the variables we identify for cuts are the most distinctive , but deserve a multivariate analysis with detector simulation .",
    "we do construct an additional variable in section  [ sec : disc ] which is not used for cuts , but rather can be used to extract the higgs boson mass from the final event sample .",
    "we simulate @xmath22 collisions at the cern lhc , @xmath23  tev .",
    "all signal and background cross sections are determined in terms of full tree level matrix elements for the contributing subprocesses and are discussed in more detail below .    for all our numerical results we have chosen @xmath24 , @xmath25  gev , and @xmath26 , which translates into @xmath27  gev and @xmath28 when using the tree - level relations between these input parameters .",
    "this value of @xmath29 is somewhat lower than the current world average of @xmath30 gev .",
    "however , this difference has negligible effects on all cross sections , e.g. the @xmath31 signal cross section varies by about @xmath32 between these two @xmath1 mass values .",
    "the tree level relations between the input parameters are kept in order to guarantee electroweak gauge invariance of all amplitudes . for all qcd effects , the running of the strong coupling constant",
    "is evaluated at one - loop order , with @xmath33 .",
    "we employ cteq4l parton distribution functions  @xcite throughout . unless otherwise noted the factorization scale is chosen as @xmath34 min(@xmath35 ) of the defined jets .",
    "the signal can be described , at lowest order , by two single - feynman - diagram processes , @xmath37 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath38 and @xmath39 fusion where the weak bosons are emitted from the incoming quarks  @xcite . because of the small higgs boson width in the mass range of interest",
    ", these events can reliably be simulated in the narrow width approximation . from previous studies of @xmath40",
    "@xcite and @xmath41  @xcite decays in weak boson fusion we know several features of the signal , which can be exploited here also : the centrally produced higgs boson tends to yield central decay products ( in this case @xmath42 ) , and the two quarks enter the detector at large rapidity compared to the @xmath1 s and with transverse momenta in the 20 to 100 gev range , thus leading to two observable forward tagging jets .    for the study of a central jet veto",
    ", we utilize the results of previous studies where we simulated the emission of at least one extra parton  @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by calculating the cross sections for the process @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ weak boson fusion with radiation of an additional gluon , and all crossing related processes .",
    "an important additional tool for distinguishing the @xmath44 signal from various backgrounds is the anti - correlation of the @xmath1 spins , as pointed out in ref .",
    "this is due to the preservation of angular momentum in the decay of the spin-0 higgs boson . of course",
    ", we can observe only the angular distributions of the charged decay leptons , but this is sufficient .",
    "the decay rate is proportional to @xmath45 . in the rest frame of the higgs boson ,",
    "in which the @xmath46 or @xmath47 pairs are emitted back - to - back for @xmath42 production at threshold , this product is a maximum for the charged leptons being emitted parallel .",
    "this characteristic is preserved and even enhanced when boosted to the lab frame , as the higgs boson in weak boson fusion is typically emitted with @xmath48  gev .      given the h decay signature , the main physics background to our @xmath50 signal arises from @xmath51 production , due to the large top production cross section at the lhc and because the branching ratio @xmath52 is essentially @xmath53 .    the basic process we consider is @xmath54 , which can be either @xmath55- or @xmath56-initiated , with the former strongly dominating at the lhc .",
    "qcd corrections to this lead to additional real parton emission , _",
    "i.e. _ to @xmath57 events .",
    "relevant subprocesses are [ qcd_tt ] g q t |t q , g |q t |t |q , q    @xmath58 events can be obtained similarly . for the case of no additional partons ,",
    "the @xmath20 s from the decaying top quarks may be identified as the tagging jets . in this case , calculating the cross section for @xmath57 where the @xmath20 s are explicitly identified as the tagging jets serves to estimate the effect of additional soft parton emission , _",
    "i.e. _ minijet activity in the central detector ; this is described in detail in sec .  [ sec : minijet ] . at the same time",
    ", we can identify a distinctly different , perturbative region of phase space , where the final - state light quark or gluon gives rise to one tagging jet , and one of the two decay @xmath20 s is identified as the other tagging jet . in this case",
    ", @xmath58 may be used to estimate minijet activity for the hard process @xmath59 .",
    "finally , there is a third distinct region of phase space , for the perturbative hard process @xmath60 , where the final state light quarks or gluons are the two tagging jets .",
    "thus , the `` @xmath61 '' and `` @xmath62 '' calculations serve a dual purpose : to obtain the cross sections for the contribution of the perturbative processes where light quark or gluon jets lie in the region of phase space where they are experimentally identified as far - forward / backward tagging jets ; and to estimate the additional qcd radiation patterns for the next - lower - order perturbative @xmath51 process .",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath64 matrix elements were constructed using madgraph  @xcite , while the @xmath62 matrix elements are from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "decays of the top quarks and @xmath1 s are included in the matrix elements ; however , while the @xmath1 s are allowed to be off - shell , the top quarks are required to be on - shell .",
    "energy loss from @xmath65 is included to generate more accurate @xmath66 distributions . in all cases ,",
    "the factorization scale is chosen as @xmath34 min(@xmath67 ) of the massless partons / top quarks .",
    "the overall strong coupling constant factors are taken as @xmath68 , where the product runs over all light quarks , gluons and top quarks ; _ i.e. _ the transverse momentum of each additional parton is taken as the relevant scale for its production , irrespective of the hardness of the underlying scattering event .",
    "this procedure guarantees that the same @xmath69 factors are used for the hard part of a @xmath51 event , independent of the number of additional minijets , and at the same time the small scales relevant for soft - parton emission are implemented .",
    "the next obvious background arises from real - emission qcd corrections to @xmath42 production . for @xmath71 events",
    "these background processes include  @xcite [ qcd_ww ] q g q g w^+ w^- , q q q q w^+ w^- , which are dominated by @xmath15-channel gluon exchange , and all crossing related processes , such as q |q g g w^+ w^- , g g q |q w^+ w^- .",
    "we call these processes collectively the `` qcd @xmath72 '' background",
    ". we do not calculate cross sections for the corresponding @xmath73-jet processes , but instead follow the results of our analysis of the radiation patterns of qcd @xmath74 processes , detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : minijet ] , and apply those results here to estimate minijet veto probabilities .    the factorization scale is chosen as for the higgs boson signal .",
    "the strong coupling constant factor is taken as @xmath75 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the transverse momentum of each additional parton is taken as the relevant scale for its production .",
    "variation of the scales by a factor 2 or @xmath76 reveals scale uncertainties of @xmath77 , however , which emphasizes the need for experimental input or nlo calculations .",
    "the @xmath38 background lacks the marked anti - correlation of @xmath1 spins seen in the signal . as a result",
    "the momenta of the charged decay leptons will be more widely separated than in @xmath16 events .",
    "these backgrounds arise from @xmath42 bremsstrahlung in quark(anti)quark scattering via @xmath15-channel electroweak boson exchange , with subsequent decay @xmath78 : qq qq w^+w^- [ eq : ew_ww ] navely , this ew background may be thought of as suppressed compared to the analogous qcd process in eq .",
    "( [ qcd_ww ] ) .",
    "however , it includes electroweak boson fusion , @xmath79 via @xmath80- or @xmath15-channel @xmath81-exchange or via @xmath82 4-point vertices , which has a momentum and color structure identical to the signal .",
    "thus , it can not easily be suppressed via cuts .",
    "the matrix elements for these processes were constructed using madgraph  @xcite .",
    "we include charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) processes , but discard s - channel ew boson and t - channel quark exchange processes as their contribution was found to be @xmath83 only , while adding significantly to the cpu time needed for the calculation . in general , for the regions of phase space containing far - forward and -backward tagging jets , s - channel processes are severely suppressed .",
    "we refer collectively to these processes as the `` ew @xmath72 '' background .",
    "both @xmath1 s are allowed to be off - shell , and all off - resonance graphs are included . in addition",
    ", the higgs boson graphs must be included to make the calculation well - behaved at large @xmath1-pair invariant masses .",
    "however , these graphs include our signal processes and might lead to double counting .",
    "thus , we set @xmath84 to 60  gev in the ew @xmath72 background to remove their contribution .",
    "a clean separation of the higgs boson signal and the ew @xmath72 background is possible because interference effects between the two are negligible for the higgs boson mass range of interest .",
    "again we will need an estimate of additional gluon radiation patterns .",
    "this was first done for ew processes in ref .",
    "@xcite , but for different cuts on the hard process , and again for ew @xmath85 processes in ref .",
    "we reanalyze the ew @xmath85 case in sec .",
    "[ sec : minijet ] and directly apply the resulting minijet emission probabilities here .",
    "the ew @xmath85 and ew @xmath72 backgrounds are quite similar kinematically , which justifies the use of the same veto probabilities for central jets .",
    "the leptonic decay of @xmath87 s provides a source of electrons , muons and neutrinos which can be misidentified as @xmath1 decays .",
    "thus , we need to study real - emission qcd corrections to the drell - yan process @xmath88 . for @xmath89 events",
    "these background processes include  @xcite [ qcd_tau ] q g q g ^+ ^- , q q q q ^+ ^- , which are dominated by @xmath15-channel gluon exchange , and all crossing - related processes , such as q |q g g ^+ ^- , g g q |q ^+ ^- .",
    "all interference effects between virtual photon and @xmath90-exchange are included .",
    "we call these processes collectively the `` qcd @xmath85 '' background .",
    "the cross sections for the corresponding @xmath91-jet processes , which we need for our modeling of minijet activity in the qcd @xmath85 background , have been calculated in refs .",
    "similar to the treatment of the signal processes , we use a parton - level monte - carlo program based on the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to model the qcd @xmath85 and @xmath92 backgrounds .    from our study of @xmath41 in weak boson fusion  @xcite , we know that the ew ( t - channel weak boson exchange ) cross section will be comparable to the qcd cross section in the phase space region of interest .",
    "thus , we consider those processes separately , in a similar manner as for the ew @xmath72 contribution .",
    "we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for modeling the ew @xmath85 background .",
    "the dual leptonic decays of the @xmath87 s are simulated by multiplying the @xmath93 cross section by a branching ratio factor of @xmath94 and by implementing collinear tau decays with helicity correlations included as in our previous analysis of @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "the qcd processes discussed above lead to steeply falling jet transverse momentum distributions . as a result , finite detector resolution can have a sizable effect on cross sections .",
    "these resolution effects are taken into account via gaussian smearing of the energies of jets/@xmath20 s and charged leptons .",
    "we use = 5.2 e .009 , for jets ( with individual terms added in quadrature ) , based on atlas expectations  @xcite . for charged leptons",
    "we use = 2% .",
    "in addition , finite detector resolution leads to fake missing - transverse - momentum in events with hard jets .",
    "an atlas analysis  @xcite showed that these effects are well parameterized by a gaussian distribution of the components of the fake missing transverse momentum vector , @xmath95 , with resolution ( p_x , p_y ) = 0.46 , for each component . in our calculations ,",
    "these fake missing transverse momentum vectors are added linearly to the neutrino momenta .",
    "the @xmath96 dual leptonic decay signal is characterized by two forward jets and the @xmath1 decay leptons ( @xmath97 ) . before discussing background levels and further details like minijet radiation patterns ,",
    "we need to identify the search region for these hard @xmath98 events .",
    "the task is identical to the higgs searches in @xmath99 which were considered previously  @xcite . we can thus adopt the strategy of these earlier analyses and start out by discussing a basic level of cuts on the @xmath100 signal",
    "throughout this section we assume a higgs mass of @xmath101  gev , but we do not optimize cuts for this mass .",
    "the minimum acceptance requirements ensure that the two jets and two charged leptons are observed inside the detector ( within the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters , respectively ) , and are well - separated from each other : [ eq : basic ] & p_t_j 20  gev , |_j| 5.0 , r_jj 0.7 , + & p_t _ 20  gev , |_| 2.5 , r_j 0.7 .",
    "a feature of the qcd @xmath72 background is the generally higher rapidity of the @xmath1 s as compared to the higgs signal : weak boson bremsstrahlung occurs at small angles with respect to the parent quarks , producing @xmath1 s forward of the jets .",
    "thus , we also require both @xmath102 s to lie between the jets with a separation in pseudorapidity @xmath103 , and the jets to occupy opposite hemispheres : [ eq : lepcen ] _",
    "j , min + 0.7 < _ _ 1,2 < _ j , max - 0.7 , _ j_1 _",
    "j_2 < 0 finally , to reach the starting point for our consideration of the signal and various backgrounds , a wide separation in pseudorapidity is required between the two forward tagging jets , [ eq : gap ] _ tags = |_j_1-_j_2| 4.4 , leaving a gap of at least 3 units of pseudorapidity in which the @xmath102 s can be observed .",
    "this technique to separate weak boson scattering from various backgrounds is well - established  @xcite , in particular for heavy higgs boson searches .",
    "line 1 of table  [ ww_data ] shows the effect of these cuts on the signal and backgrounds for a sm higgs boson of mass @xmath104  gev .",
    "overall , about @xmath105 of all @xmath106 events generated in weak boson fusion are accepted by the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basic]-[eq : gap ] ) ( for @xmath104  gev ) .    somewhat surprisingly , the ew @xmath72 background rate reaches 2/3 of the qcd @xmath72 background rate already at this level .",
    "this can be explained by the contribution from @xmath107 exchange and fusion processes which can produce central @xmath1 pairs and are therefore kinematically similar to the signal .",
    "this signal - like component remains after the forward jet tagging cuts .",
    "as is readily seen from the first line of table  [ ww_data ] , the most worrisome background is @xmath1 pairs from @xmath51 production . of the 1080 fb at the basic cuts level ,",
    "12 fb are from @xmath2 , 310 fb are from @xmath61 , and the remaining 760 fb arise from @xmath62 production .",
    "the additional jets ( corresponding to massless partons ) are required to be identified as far forward tagging jets .",
    "the @xmath62 cross section is largest because the @xmath2 pair is not required to have as large an invariant mass as in the first two cases , where one or both @xmath20 s from the decay of the top quarks are required to be the tagging jets .    for the events where one or both of the @xmath20 s are not identified as the tagging jets",
    ", they will most frequently lie between the two tagging jets , in the region where we search for the @xmath1 decay leptons .",
    "vetoing events with these additional @xmath20 jets provides a powerful suppression tool to control the top background .",
    "note that this does _ not _ require a @xmath20-tag , merely rejection of any events that have an additional jet , which in this case would be from a hadronically decaying @xmath20 .",
    "we discard all events where a @xmath20 or @xmath108 jet with @xmath109  gev is observed in the gap region between the tagging jets , [ eq : bveto ] p_t_b > 20 gev , _",
    "j , min < _ b < _ j , max .",
    "this leads to a reduction of @xmath61 events by a factor 7 while @xmath62 events are suppressed by a factor 100 .",
    "this results in cross sections of 43 and 7.6 fb , respectively , at the level of the forward tagging cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basic]-[eq : gap ] ) , which are now comparable to the other individual backgrounds .",
    "this is shown in the second line of table  [ ww_data ] .",
    "note that the much higher @xmath20 veto probability for @xmath62 events results in a lower cross section than that for @xmath61 events , an ordering which will remain even after final cuts have been imposed ( see below ) .",
    "qcd processes at hadron colliders typically occur at smaller invariant masses than ew processes , due to the dominance of gluons at small feynman @xmath110 in the incoming protons .",
    "we observe this behavior here , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mjj ] .",
    "the three @xmath51 backgrounds have been combined for clarity , even though their individual distributions are slightly different .",
    "we can thus significantly reduce much of the qcd background by imposing a lower bound on the invariant mass of the tagging jets : [ eq : mjj ] m_jj > 650  gev .",
    "another significant difference is the angular distribution of the charged decay leptons , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , relative to each other . in the case of the higgs signal ,",
    "the @xmath1 spins are anti - correlated , so the leptons are preferentially emitted in the same direction , close to each other .",
    "a significant fraction of the various backgrounds does not have anti - correlated @xmath1 spins .",
    "these differences are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : angdist ] , which shows the azimuthal ( transverse plane ) opening angle , polar ( lab ) opening angle , and separation in the lego plot .",
    "we exploit these features by establishing the following lepton - pair angular cuts : [ eq : ang ] _ e < 105^ , cos _",
    "e > 0.2 , r_e < 2.2 . it should be noted that while these cuts appear to be very conservative , for higher higgs boson masses the @xmath113 and @xmath114 distribution broadens out to higher values , overlapping the backgrounds more . for @xmath115  gev these cuts are roughly optimized and further tightening would require greater integrated luminosity for discovery at this upper end of the mass range . because of the excellent signal - to - background ratio achieved below , we prefer to work with uniform acceptance cuts , instead of optimizing the cuts for specific higgs boson mass regions .",
    "we also examine the distributions for lepton - pair invariant mass , @xmath116 , and maximum lepton @xmath35 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mllptl ] for the case @xmath117  gev .",
    "as is readily seen , the qcd backgrounds and ew @xmath72 background prefer significantly higher values for both observables .",
    "thus , in addition to the angular variables , we find it useful to restrict the individual @xmath35 of the leptons , as well as the invariant mass of the pair : [ eq : adv ] m_e < 110 , p_t_e , < 120",
    ". these are particularly effective against the top backgrounds , where the large top mass allows for very high-@xmath35 leptons far from the tagging jets , and against the ew @xmath72 background , where the leptons tend to be well - separated in the lego plot .",
    "again , the cuts are set quite conservatively so as not to bias a lower higgs boson mass .",
    "results after cuts  ( [ eq : mjj]-[eq : adv ] ) are shown on the third line of table  [ ww_data ] , for the case of a 160  gev higgs boson .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the high purity of the signal is made possible because the weak boson fusion process , together with the @xmath121 decay , provides a complex signal with a multitude of characteristics which distinguish it from the various backgrounds .",
    "the basic feature of the @xmath31 signal is the presence of two forward tagging jets inside the acceptance region of the lhc detectors , of sizable @xmath35 , and of dijet invariant mass in the tev range .",
    "typical qcd backgrounds , with isolated charged leptons and two hard jets , are much softer .",
    "in addition , the qcd backgrounds are dominated by @xmath1 bremsstrahlung off forward scattered quarks , which give typically higher - rapidity charged leptons .",
    "in contrast , the ew processes give rise to quite central leptons , and this includes not only the higgs signal but also ew @xmath72 and @xmath85 production , which also proceed via weak boson fusion .",
    "it is this similarity that prevents one from ignoring ew analogs to background qcd processes , which a priori are smaller by two orders of magnitude in total cross section , but after basic cuts remain the same size as their qcd counterparts .    for @xmath122 decays ,",
    "lepton angular distributions are extremely useful for reducing the backgrounds even further .",
    "the anti - correlation of @xmath1 spins in @xmath123 decay forces the charged leptons to be preferentially emitted in the same direction , close together in the lego plot .",
    "this happens for a small fraction of the background only .",
    "we have identified the most important distributions for enhancing the signal relative to the background , and set the various cuts conservatively to avoid bias for a certain higgs boson mass range .",
    "there is ample room for improvement of our results via a multivariate analysis of a complete set of signal and background distributions , which we encourage the lhc collaborations to pursue .",
    "additional suppression of the @xmath51 background may be possible with @xmath20 identification and veto in the @xmath124  gev region .",
    "in addition to various invariant mass and angular cuts , we can differentiate between the @xmath1 s of the signal and @xmath125 backgrounds and the real @xmath87 s in the qcd and ew @xmath85 backgrounds .",
    "this is possible because the high energy of the produced @xmath87 s makes their decay products almost collinear .",
    "combined with the substantial @xmath35 of the @xmath86 system this allows for @xmath87-pair mass reconstruction .",
    "the @xmath1 decays do not exhibit this collinearity due to their large mass , thus the angular correlation between the @xmath126 vector and the charged lepton momenta is markedly different .",
    "our real-@xmath87 rejection makes use of these differences and promises to virtually eliminate the @xmath85 backgrounds .",
    "we advocate taking advantage of an additional fundamental characteristic of qcd and ew processes .",
    "color - singlet exchange in the @xmath15-channel , as encountered in higgs boson production by weak boson fusion ( and in the ew @xmath127 background ) , leads to additional soft jet activity which differs strikingly from that expected for the qcd backgrounds in both geometry and hardness : gluon radiation in qcd processes is typically both more central and harder than in wbf processes .",
    "we exploit this radiation , via a veto on events with central minijets of @xmath109  gev , and expect a typical @xmath128 reduction in qcd backgrounds and about a @xmath129 suppression of ew backgrounds , but only about a @xmath130 loss of the signal .    beyond the possibility of discovering the higgs boson in the @xmath122 mode , or confirmation of its existence , measuring the cross sections in both weak boson and gluon fusion will be important both as a test of the standard model and as a search for new physics .",
    "for such a measurement , via the analysis outlined in this paper , minijet veto probabilities must be precisely known . for calibration purposes",
    ", one can analyze @xmath127 events at the lhc .",
    "the production rates of the qcd and ew @xmath127 events can be reliably predicted and , thus , the observation of the @xmath131 peak allows for a direct experimental assessment of the minijet veto efficiencies , in a kinematic configuration very similar to the higgs signal .",
    "observation of sm @xmath44 at the lhc is possible for very low integrated luminosities , if the higgs boson lies in the mass range between about 130 and 200 gev .",
    "weak boson fusion at the lhc will be an exciting process to study , for a weakly coupled higgs sector just as much as for strong interactions in the symmetry breaking sector of electroweak interactions .",
