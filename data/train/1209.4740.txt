    "after finishing core - hydrogen - burning the progenitors of hot subdwarf stars ( sdbs ) leave the main sequence and evolve to red giants before igniting helium and settling down on the extreme horizontal branch .",
    "unlike normal stars , the sdb progenitors must have experienced a phase of extensive mass loss on the red giant branch , in order to explain the high temperatures and gravities observed at the surface of hot subdwarf stars .",
    "after consumption of the helium fuel they evolve directly to white dwarfs ( wds ) avoiding a second red - giant phase .",
    "what causes this extensive mass loss remains an open question .",
    "about half of the sdb stars reside in close binaries with periods as short as @xmath3d @xcite . because the components separation in these systems is much less than the size of the subdwarf progenitor in its red - giant phase",
    ", these systems must have experienced a common - envelope and spiral - in phase @xcite . although most of the close companions to sdb stars are low - mass main sequence stars , brown dwarfs or low mass wds ( @xmath4 ) , more massive compact companions like wds , neutron stars or black holes have been either observed or predicted by theory @xcite .",
    "subdwarf binaries with massive wd companions turned out to be candidates for supernova type ia ( sn ia ) progenitors because these systems lose angular momentum due to the emission of gravitational waves and shrink .",
    "mass transfer or the subsequent merger of the system may cause the wd to reach the chandrasekhar limit and explode as a sn  ia ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "one of the best known candidate systems for the double degenerate merger scenario is the sdb+wd binary kpd1930@xmath52752 @xcite .",
    "the sdb+wd binary cd@xmath63011223 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) has been discovered in the course of the muchfuss project , which aims at finding hot subdwarf binary systems with massive compact companions @xcite .",
    "it was selected as an uv - excess object and spectroscopically identified to be an sdb star by @xcite .",
    "the star was chosen as a bright backup target for our muchfuss follow - up campaign . due to bad observing conditions , which did not allow us to observe our main targets , two medium resolution spectra ( @xmath10 )",
    "were taken consecutively with the efosc2 spectrograph mounted at the esontt at june 10 , 2012 .",
    "the spectra showed a very high radial velocity shift ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the star was observed by the superwasp planetary transit survey @xcite .",
    "the light curve was downloaded from the public archive and consists of more than @xmath12 measurements taken from may 4 , 2006 to august 9 , 2008 .",
    "the light curve shows a clear variation caused by the ellipsoidal deformation and doppler boosting of the sdb primary @xcite , which allowed us to derive the orbital period based on fitting an harmonic series ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variation is @xmath14 and therefore the highest ever measured in an sdb binary .",
    "first spectroscopic follow - up data was obtained with the grating spectrograph mounted on the saao-1.9 m telescope at july 2 , 2012 .",
    "the rv - curve measured from 18 single spectra confirmed the short orbital period and a high rv - semiamplitude ( @xmath15 ) . in order to improve the orbital solution",
    ", we took another 105 spectra with the isis spectrograph ( @xmath16 ) mounted at the wht during a dedicated muchfuss - follow - up - run from july 9 to 12 , 2012 .",
    "another 175 spectra were taken with the the goodman spectrograph mounted at the soar telescope ( @xmath17 ) at july 16 , 2012 .    additionally , @xmath18 of time - series photometry in the v - band ( @xmath19 ) were taken with soar / goodman at july 6 , 2012 under photometric conditions .",
    "eclipses are detected in this high - quality light curve .",
    "the eclipse of the sdb by the wd companion is clearly visible and the flat bottom seen in the other minima indicates a shallow secondary eclipse as well ( see fig .",
    "the radial velocities ( rvs ) were measured by fitting a set of mathematical functions ( gaussians , lorentzians and polynomials ) mimicking the typical voigt profile of spectral lines to the hydrogen balmer lines and helium lines using the fitsb2 routine .",
    "the profiles are fitted to all suitable lines simultaneously using @xmath20-minimization and the rv - shift with respect to the rest wavelengths is measured . assuming a circular orbit sine curves were fitted to the rv data points in fine steps over a range of test periods close to the orbital period derived from photometry .",
    "the two datasets obtained with isis and goodman are treated separately to investigate systematic errors .",
    "details about the analysis method and error estimation are given in @xcite .",
    "the derived orbital parameters from the isis dataset ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , see fig .",
    "[ rv ] ) and the goodman dataset ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) are roughly consistent .",
    "the deviation in system velocity is most likely caused by a slight systematic zero - point shift between the two instruments .",
    "cd@xmath63011223 is the sdb binary with the shortest orbital period and the highest rv - amplitude discovered so far .",
    "the atmospheric parameters effective temperature @xmath25 , surface gravity @xmath26 , helium abundance @xmath27 and projected rotational velocity were determined by fitting simultaneously the observed hydrogen and helium lines of the single spectra with metal - line - blanketed lte model spectra as described in @xcite .",
    "no significant variations of the parameters with orbital phase have been detected .",
    "average values and standard deviations have been calculated for the isis ( @xmath28,@xmath29,@xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and goodman datasets ( @xmath32,@xmath33,@xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , separately .",
    "the derived parameters are consistent with literature values within the uncertainties @xcite .",
    "since the spectra of the cd@xmath63011223 are single - lined , they contain no information about the orbital motion of the companion , and thus only the mass function @xmath36 can be calculated .",
    "although the rv semi - amplitude @xmath37 and the period @xmath38 are determined by the rv curve , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the inclination angle @xmath41 remain free parameters . assuming a reasonable value for @xmath39 only a lower limit can be derived for @xmath40 .",
    "if the rotation of the companion is synchronised to its orbital motion , which is the case in cd@xmath63011223 , the rotational velocity @xmath42 can be calculated .",
    "the radius of the primary is given by the relation @xmath43 .",
    "the measurement of the projected rotational velocity @xmath44 therefore allows us to constrain the inclination angle @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath39 remains the only free parameter .",
    "we varied @xmath39 , solved the mass function , and derived both the inclination angle and the companion mass .",
    "because of @xmath45 a lower limit for the sdb mass is given by @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we can constrain the mass of the sdb to be higher than @xmath47 , and the mass of the wd companion to be higher than @xmath48 in this way .    a quantitative analysis of the light curve obtained with soar / goodman fitting synthetic models",
    "is ongoing and necessary to constrain the parameters more accurately .",
    "however , the fact that cd@xmath63011223 is eclipsing already tells us that the inclination must be high ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "with all these parameters reasonably well constrained we find that cd@xmath63011223 has the smallest separation ( @xmath50 ) of all known sdb binaries .",
    "due to the emission of gravitational waves , the binary is predicted to shrink until the sdb fills its roche lobe and starts mass transfer in less then @xmath1 . according to its atmospheric parameters , the sdb has just started the core helium - burning phase , which typically lasts for about @xmath51 .",
    "helium - rich material is therefore transferred to the wd companion , which according to its mass must consist of carbon and oxygen .",
    "this mass transfer is likely to be stable and will lead to the accumulation of a he - layer on top of the wd .",
    "after accreting @xmath52 he - burning is predicted to be ignited in this shell .",
    "this in turn can trigger the ignition of carbon in the core even if the wd - mass is significantly lower than the chandrasekhar limit @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations predict the explosion of a co - wd with a minimum mass of only @xmath53 triggered by the ignition of an he - shell of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "these parameters closely match the properties of cd@xmath63011223 , which therefore becomes a viable candidate for snia progenitor via this so - called double - detonation scenario .",
