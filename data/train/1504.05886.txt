    "in paper  @xcite we proposed a general method which allows to determine spectra of quantum systems given in the bargmann representation .",
    "this representation is very useful for systems with a hilbert space which is a product of a finite and infinite - dimensional spaces .",
    "a typical example is a hamiltonian for spin degrees of freedom of some particles , characterised by @xmath0-dimensional @xmath1 matrices , coupled to a bosonic field via annihilation and creation operators @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath0-component wave function @xmath4 is an element of hilbert space @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the bargmann - fock hilbert space of entire functions . the scalar product in @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 since operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 are represented by @xmath8 and multiplication by @xmath9 , respectively , for clearly @xmath10=1 $ ]",
    ", stationary schrdinger equation @xmath11 becomes the system of linear ordinary differential equations .",
    "usually such systems have a certain number of regular singular points in the complex @xmath9 plane , and possibly an irregular point at infinity .",
    "determination of the spectrum consists in finding such values of @xmath12 that all the components of wave function @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , are elements of the hilbert space @xmath6 .    in paper",
    "@xcite we have shown that a solution of the eigenvalue problem can be reduced to checking the following three conditions .",
    "1 .   local conditions . at each regular singular point @xmath15",
    "there exists at least one solution which is holomorphic in an open set containing @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   global conditions . at each singular point",
    "we can select a local holomorphic solution in such a way that they are analytic continuations of each other .",
    "that is , they are local representations of an entire solution .",
    "3 .   normalisation conditions .",
    "the entire solution selected above must have a finite bargmann norm .",
    "the first two conditions were analysed in detail in  @xcite and in @xcite we gave their effective application for determination of full spectrum of the rabi system .",
    "the third condition is highly non - trivial .",
    "this is so because `` most '' of entire functions do not belong to @xmath6 .",
    "in order to analyse this condition we need to characterise the growth of an entire solution @xmath17 of a system of linear differential equations . in a neighbourhood of a regular singular point",
    "the growth of @xmath17 is polynomial .",
    "hence , if the considered system has only regular singular points , and @xmath17 is its entire solution , then @xmath17 has a finite bargmann norm .",
    "normalisation conditions can give non - trivial constrains on entire solution only if the linear system has an irregular singularity , for example at infinity .",
    "the growth of entire function @xmath17 is described by means of the following function : @xmath18 it is used to define two numbers which characterise properties of the growth .",
    "the order , or the growth order @xmath19 of @xmath17 is defined as the limit @xmath20 for an entire function of finite order @xmath21 , its type @xmath1 is defined as @xmath22 if @xmath17 belongs to @xmath6 , then one can prove the following facts",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath17 is of order @xmath23 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath24 , then @xmath17 is of type @xmath25 .    if @xmath24 and @xmath26 , then the question whether @xmath27 requires a separate investigation . for additional details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in a neighbourhood of a regular singular point , a formal procedure allows to find formal series which satisfy the equation .",
    "it appears that this formal series is convergent , so it is a local solution of the equation . in a vicinity of irregular singular point",
    "a formal procedure gives formal expressions which satisfy the equation , however the series are generally divergent .",
    "it is known that these formal expressions , give the asymptotic expansion of a solution valid in in certain sectors radially extending from the vertex localised at this singularity .",
    "borders of sectors are determined by the so - called stokes lines .",
    "the asymptotic expansions change when we pass from one sector to another .",
    "these changes are governed by the so - called stokes matrices .",
    "the normalisation condition of an entire solution @xmath17 implies that at each sector @xmath28 the following integral @xmath29 has a finite value .",
    "thus , at each sector it has good asymptotics which guarantees the convergence of the above integral .",
    "this implies that although a solution @xmath17 can change its asymptotic expansion from sector to sector , these changes are restricted only to good asymptotics .",
    "this property implies that all stokes matrices have a common invariant subspace , in particular case just one common eigenvector .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the above considerations can be applied effectively .",
    "we consider system given by the following hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the pauli spin matrices and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are parameters . for @xmath37 , it coincides with the hamiltonian of the rabi model @xcite describing interaction of a two - level atom with a single harmonic mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "hamiltonian was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath38 can be interpreted as a nonlinear coupling between the atom and the cavity .    in bargmann - fock representation ,",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath11 , with @xmath39 , have the form @xmath40 in our paper @xcite we calculated the spectrum of @xmath41 for the generic case , i.e. , when the above system has two regular singular points .",
    "this requires that @xmath42 , and the quantisation of the energy spectrum results from the condition that system   admits an entire solution . in that case , all entire solutions of   have a finite norm .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the remaining cases for which @xmath43 . for @xmath44 system",
    "can be rewritten in the form @xmath45}{g^2}\\psi_2(z ) .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] the system for the case of @xmath46 can be obtained from the above equations by a simple change @xmath47 , and the interchange @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "hence , we consider only the case @xmath44 .",
    "system   has no singular points in the finite part of @xmath50 , so all its solutions are entire functions .",
    "infinity is the only and irregular singular point .",
    "the system can have solutions which grow fast enough to make the bargmann norm infinite .",
    "thus , to determine the spectrum of the problem we have to find all values of @xmath12 for which system admits a solution with a moderate growth at infinity , such that its bargmann norm is finite .    we give a full answer to this question .",
    "that is we specify explicitly a countable number of energy values for which the corresponding eigenfunctions are also given explicitly and have a finite bargmann norm .",
    "the energy axis is divided into two disjoint intervals , each of them with its own countable family of eigenvalues . to be more precise",
    ", our main result is as follows .",
    "let @xmath51 be an auxiliary spectral parameter .",
    "then the hamiltonian has entire solutions with a finite bargmann norm if and only if one of the following conditions is fulfilled .",
    "either @xmath52 , and @xmath53 or @xmath54 , and @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the respective eigenfunctions @xmath57 are given by @xmath58{x^2 - 1}\\ , z\\right),\\\\      \\psi_{2,n}^{\\pm}(z ) & =      \\frac{\\omega}{g(x-1)}\\left[\\psi_{1,n}^{\\pm}(z)+        \\left(\\psi_{1,n}^{\\pm}(z)\\right)'\\right ] ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes the hermite polynomial of degree @xmath0 , and @xmath60 these functions have the growth order @xmath24 and type @xmath61 .",
    "an asymptotic expansion of a function @xmath62 for @xmath63 is denoted in the following way @xmath64 by definition it means that in a given sector @xmath65 we have @xmath66 for an arbitrary @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "such series needs not have a positive radius of convergence .    note that if @xmath69 for a certain function @xmath70 , then , in particular @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    the general form of solutions around irregular singular points is known , and there are several classical theorems on them .",
    "we choose two , particularly suitable here , namely theorems 12.3 and 19.1 given in @xcite , which tell as the following .",
    "let us suppose that the system in question can be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is @xmath75 matrix holomorphic in a neighbourhood of infinity and @xmath76 is nonzero .",
    "then in every sufficiently narrow sector @xmath28 , the equation has a fundamental matrix of solutions of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant @xmath75 matrix , @xmath79 is a diagonal matrix whose elements are polynomials of @xmath80 with a suitable positive integer @xmath81 , and @xmath82 admits an asymptotic power series in @xmath83 . if we further assume that the eigenvalues @xmath84 of @xmath85 , are all distinct , then    * @xmath78 is a diagonal matrix , * @xmath86 and @xmath79 is also diagonal with leading terms of @xmath87 , * @xmath28 can be any sector of central angle not exceeding @xmath88 .",
    "the fact that asymptotic expansions are unique allows for their formal calculation , and the above tells us , that there are always solutions which grow according to the prescribed formal expressions .",
    "the problem is that for a true ( not just formal ) solution the asymptotic behaviour changes from sector to sector  only in rare cases are the expansions valid for all values of the argument .",
    "it can be shown , see @xcite , that if a function is single valued near infinity , its asymptotic expansion is valid for all values of @xmath89 if and only if it is analytic at @xmath90 and the series is actually convergent .    in our case",
    "the requirement of finite bargmann norm is that @xmath91 and @xmath92 when @xmath24 .",
    "so the determination of the exponential factor will be crucial , and we shall see that the considered model presents us with functions of growth order @xmath24 and varying types @xmath1 , which require detailed analysis .",
    "in the case @xmath93 the considered model is described by  .",
    "this system has the standard form with @xmath94 .",
    "since the leading matrix @xmath85 is nilpotent , it is convenient to perform a shearing transform @xmath95 after which the system becomes @xmath96 where @xmath97^t$ ] , @xmath98 is a new spectral parameter defined by  .",
    "the rank of the system is thus @xmath99 , and the matrix @xmath85 has eigenvalues @xmath100 .",
    "we can immediately discard the case of them being equal , for then , the system is explicitly solvable .",
    "for example , when @xmath101 we have @xmath102 and these functions have infinite bargmann norm .",
    "we are thus left only with the simpler case of two distinct eigenvalues and we know what form of asymptotic expansions to expect .",
    "following birkhoff @xcite , let us assume the following laplace integral representation for the vector of solutions @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "the usual inverse laplace transform would be @xmath105 however , such @xmath106 would , in general , have essential singularities in the finite complex plane because we are dealing with an equation of rank 2 . to remedy this , the exponential part needs to be modified in anticipation of the growth order 2 .",
    "this procedure is applicable whenever the matrix @xmath85 has different eigenvalues , regardless of the rank of the equation , for further details see  @xcite .",
    "the contour of integration @xmath107 is chosen so that the integrand assumes the same value at both ends .",
    "it could be a loop or an open contour extending to infinity . here",
    ", the latter is more viable , and @xmath107 will be one of the curves shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this will allow to integrate by parts as follows @xmath108_c -\\int_c\\exp(z^2 y)z^{n-2}u'(y)\\mathrm{d}y ,    \\label{parts}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and taking the bracket term to be zero . substituting the laplace representation in equation",
    "we obtain a new system for @xmath109 with @xmath104 , by equating the integrands to zero . that this is permissible",
    "can be checked later where the particular @xmath106 are recovered but we are mostly interested in the asymptotic expansions in which case the expressions obtained will be formal anyway .",
    "the integrands are polynomials of @xmath9 and integrating by parts as in we can reduce their degree to at most 1 .",
    "then the coefficients of @xmath110 and @xmath111 must each be zero so that we end up with a system of four equations @xmath112 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath113 .",
    "first two equations can be immediately solved for two components @xmath114 this leaves two first order equations for the remaining components @xmath115 where @xmath116 although the particular equations decouple , this is obviously not a generic feature .",
    "it makes sense then to treat them as a system with two regular singular points at @xmath117 and one at infinity .",
    "the characteristic exponents are @xmath118    in general , the behaviour of a solution as it is continued around all the singular points can not be specified explicitly as the monodromy group of the equation is unknown .",
    "fortunately , solutions of system   are given explicitly @xmath119 where @xmath120 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the explicit forms of these solutions will give us full information about which contours to choose and how the continuation of any solution behaves .",
    "each singular point of the solution @xmath121 corresponds to a different exponential factor in the asymptotic expansion , which can be seen as follows .",
    "let us look at the generic case first , when the contour can be chosen as path @xmath122 that runs from infinity to the vicinity of the point @xmath123 , around it in the positive direction , then back to infinity , as depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] .    ]",
    "this requires that the characteristic exponent at that singularity @xmath124 is not an integer , for otherwise the integral vanishes . since , for the system   for all singular points the differences of exponents is @xmath125 , one solution is always suitable .    the laplace integral for any function @xmath126 which has a local power series around @xmath127 with characteristic exponent @xmath128 may be rewritten as @xmath129 where we have used the integral representation of the gamma function , and omitted indices for brevity .",
    "the series is not , in general , convergent in the whole complex plane of @xmath113 , so the integration term by term using the gamma function leads to a formal , divergent in most cases , asymptotic expansion .",
    "it can be shown that this is the correct asymptotic series @xcite , so that it is immediately evident that each singular point @xmath124 gives rise to one type of exponential factor @xmath130 in the asymptotic series .",
    "note that @xmath131 and in view of the previous section we require @xmath132 , so only one of the contours will lead to the desired growth type .",
    "the special case of @xmath133 will be dealt with separately , below .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the contour had to be chosen so that the integrand vanishes as @xmath134 and that the integral is convergent  this is ensured by @xmath135 . in other words , for a given argument of @xmath9 there is just a sector of the complex plane of @xmath113 where the integral converges and vice versa : for a given ray ( @xmath136 ) in the @xmath113 plane , there is a region of convergence in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig2 ] . because the components @xmath106 grow at most with some power of @xmath113 at infinity , the integral converges fast enough , for the function to be holomorphic and it is indeed permissible to differentiate it as we have done .        to extend the function outside one sector , the integral",
    "can be analytically continued by deforming the contour , rotating it around a given singularity . because the contour has to pass through the other singularity , the solution associated with one asymptotics could transform into a combination of both , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "this is the stokes phenomenon , and the argument of @xmath137 determines the so - called stokes lines in the @xmath9 plane , which is customarily given by the condition @xmath138 ; crossing the line causes the asymptotic expansions to mix .",
    "there is the freedom of choosing the starting contour , which corresponds to choosing a particular solution , and the first stokes line where the deformation is required depends on that choice .",
    "but if we continue a full basis increasing the argument of @xmath9 we eventually need to take into account all of the lines . for the considered case , @xmath137 is real , so there are two stokes lines which pass through the origin and form angles @xmath139 with the @xmath98-axis .        upon crossing ,",
    "the original integral decomposes into integrals over new contours , which could be written shortly as @xmath140 where @xmath141 stands for analytic continuation , and primes are used to distinguish between contours in the two regions : @xmath142 and @xmath143 , although their shape remains the same .",
    "this could be written using the stokes matrix as @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the solution obtained with @xmath122 , hence with fixed asymptotics of @xmath130 , and likewise for @xmath146 and @xmath147 . by convention ,",
    "the matrix on the right - hand side is the inverse of the stokes matrix .    as @xmath148 is not an integer , whether the additional integral actually contributes , depends on the characteristic exponent of the solution around @xmath149 .",
    "if @xmath150 is not an integer either , the stokes multiplier is obviously not zero . on the other hand , for an integer @xmath150 the contour @xmath151 can simply be deformed through the singularity so the integral is identically zero , because @xmath152 this does not mean that the asymptotic solution @xmath153 vanishes , but simply that the contour @xmath154 , which is a half line from @xmath149 to infinity , has to be used instead of @xmath151 to define the other asymptotic solution @xmath153 .",
    "the stokes matrix is then @xmath155 for completeness we note that the contour @xmath154 can be deformed analogously to the above , this time winding around @xmath124 . because @xmath148 is not an integer",
    ", the contour can not pass through the singular point and the additional path will be exactly @xmath122 . in terms of the stokes matrix we have @xmath156 in other words ,",
    "the asymptotics of the solution @xmath145 remains unchanged , while the asymptotic series @xmath153 actually exhibits the stokes phenomenon because @xmath148 is not an integer .",
    "the double primes signify contours identical to the original ones for @xmath142 but the solutions are not single - valued in general so @xmath157 are some multiples of @xmath145 .    note , that when @xmath150 is an integer , @xmath148 can not be , since their sum is @xmath158 or @xmath159 for the two solutions of @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "thus , the conditions that the contour is suited for the noninteger exponent at @xmath124 and that the stokes multiplier vanishes are consistent .",
    "there is no need then to investigate the case of integer @xmath148 , because for any @xmath161 we always have at least one solution with noninteger exponent at each of the singular points .",
    "it follows that we always have two different solutions @xmath145 with different asymptotic expansions obtained by means of the contours @xmath107 and , as stated in the previous section , the fundamental solutions have to be expressible by means of those two @xmath145 in any sector . in each case",
    "then , we know how both asymptotic solutions mix when crossing the stokes lines and hence , how the growth of any actual solution changes . for the system under consideration",
    "the situation is very simple , because only the asymptotic series with smaller @xmath124 is suitable , so that all of its stokes multipliers must be zero to ensure finite norm .",
    "it remains to verify that when @xmath162 and hence @xmath133 the resulting solutions are not normalisable , in close analogy to the @xmath101 case , where the components of the wave function behave like @xmath163 .",
    "the exponential factor in the present case can be written as @xmath164 and since the equation determining @xmath149 is real we have @xmath165 so @xmath166 . together with the bargmann measure this results in the leading factor of the form @xmath167 where we took @xmath168 .",
    "the integral over @xmath169 converges provided that the sine does not vanish , i.e. in sectors that do not include the directions @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "if there is no stokes phenomenon for the solutions with asymptotic factors of @xmath172 , it follows that the norm is not finite .",
    "if the two solutions could interchange , we would necessarily have to construct a solution which has the asymptotics of @xmath173 in the vicinity of @xmath174 .",
    "but then , continuing it through the angle of @xmath175 in @xmath176 , we would end up in a sector containing the next problematic line @xmath177 .",
    "the corresponding contour in the @xmath113 plane would have to rotate through @xmath178 and the stokes phenomenon would cause the asymptotic expansion to now contain also the series with @xmath179 whose norm would diverge in the second sector . thus regardless of the stokes multipliers , although the solutions are both entire , none of them is normalisable for @xmath180 .",
    "one could interpret this as a continuum spectrum with generalised eigenstates , because to each entire function in the bargmann space corresponds a well behaved distribution solution of the original problem in the @xmath181 space @xcite .    taking the above into account",
    ", we can finally give conditions for the original entire function to be normalisable .",
    "first , for the desired asymptotics one must have @xmath132 so that the solution starts as normalisable within some stokes sector , and second @xmath182 , so that it remains such , as it is continued throughout the whole complex plane .",
    "the second condition is going to be of the form @xmath183 or @xmath184 as there are two solutions of to choose from , but these can be written together as @xmath185 , @xmath186 .",
    "returning to the spectral parameter @xmath98 , the normalisation , and quantisation , conditions read : @xmath187 or , equivalently , @xmath188 for @xmath189 and @xmath186 . the energies of these spectra",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ; note that the lower levels become denser as @xmath12 gets closer to the continuous ( non - normalisable ) region @xmath162",
    ".    it is evident , that with these conditions there will always be one characteristic exponent that is a negative integer . in this case",
    "one of the contours @xmath107 will be equivalent to a circle and the corresponding laplace integral can be immediately evaluated using cauchy s theorem .",
    "it will yield a finite number of terms so that the solution will be a polynomial in @xmath9 with an exponential factor .",
    "a change of variables then reveals that each interval of @xmath98 has its own sets of eigenstates expressible in terms of hermite polynomials , namely @xmath190{x^2 - 1}\\ , z\\right),\\ ] ] when @xmath191 , or @xmath192{x^2 - 1}\\ , z\\right),\\ ] ] when @xmath52 , and in each case the other component is @xmath193     and @xmath194 . ]     and",
    "thin lines denote constant energy levels . ]",
    "let us rewrite system   as one equation of the second order .",
    "it reads @xmath195 where @xmath196 , @xmath98 is defined by , and @xmath197 }    { \\omega^2\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}.\\ ] ] now , we introduce new independent variable @xmath113 , and change the depended variable putting @xmath198 and @xmath199w(z).\\ ] ] we obtain the whittaker equation @xmath200 with parameters @xmath201 according to proposition  2.5 in  @xcite , there exists a basis of solutions of this equation such that two stokes matrices have the form @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath128 are some complex numbers .",
    "moreover , the stokes multiplier @xmath203 vanishes if and only if either @xmath204 , or @xmath205 is a non - negative half integer .",
    "similarly , the stokes multiplier @xmath128 vanishes if and only if either @xmath206 , or @xmath207 is a non - negative half integer .",
    "the reader can check , that in the considered case these conditions exactly coincide with those given by   and  .",
    "now , it is interesting to observe that for the whittaker equation if one of the stokes multipliers vanishes , then it is solvable in the sense of differential galois theory  all its solutions are liouvillian .",
    "more precisely , the identity component of its differential galois group is abelian , see corollary  2.1 in  @xcite .",
    "we have the same conclusions for equation   describing our problem .",
    "thus , if @xmath12 is an eigenvalue then :    1 .",
    "[ item:1 ] a stokes multiplier vanishes ; 2 .",
    "all solution are liouvillian ; 3 .",
    "the identity component of its differential galois group is solvable .",
    "these observations are very important for application .",
    "if we are able to prove inverse implications , then we have a strong tool for quantisation and finding exactly solvable systems .",
    "in fact , for low order equations there exist effective algorithms for studying their differential galois groups and liouvillian solutions .",
    "concerning the original equation , we have the full characterisation of its local galois group at infinity .",
    "although in this case it coincides with the full global group , the conclusions of @xcite suggest , that for systems with other singular points , the galois group at infinity alone gives quantisation conditions .",
    "namely , for energy values which belong to the spectrum , the group of the corresponding time - independent schrdinger equation is solvable .",
    "according to our knowledge , this is the first example of application of conditions deduced from an analysis of the stokes phenomenon for a quantum system in the bargmann representation .",
    "we only know about application of the finite norm condition for square - integrable functions to determine spectra for one - dimensional quantum systems in position representations .",
    "finiteness of this norm implies some conditions on local solutions containing real @xmath208 , see e.g. quantisation of quartic oscillator in @xcite , and related problem of stokes phenomena for prolate spheroidal wave equation considered in @xcite . in our considerations , asymptotic solutions at all sectors ,",
    "not just real infinity , are involved .",
    "it appears that in some cases these conditions are calculable analytically and then one can obtain the spectrum explicitly .",
