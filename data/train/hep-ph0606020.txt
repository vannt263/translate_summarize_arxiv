    "the calculation of electromagnetic radiative corrections ( rc ) to a given observable is typically needed when the corresponding experimental measurement reaches the precision of a few percent . in the context of flavor physics ,",
    "rc are truly at the basis for meaningful @xmath1-level phenomenology for two - fold reasons :    * one one hand , rc are essential in extracting fundamental standard model parameters ( like the ckm matrix elements ) or weak hadronic matrix elements from precisely measured decay rates . * on the other hand , recent experience shows that knowledge of radiative effects ( such as emission of real photons ) and their proper simulation are essential in performing _ precision measurements _ of branching fractions . in fact , real photon emission distorts the spectra of `` primary '' decay products and thus affects the distribution of kinematic quantities used to select and count signal events  @xcite . the inclusion of rc in the experimental fits is known to produce shifts in the measured fractions at the several percent level .",
    "the relevance of rc has been widely recognized in the k physics community , where high statistics experiments have triggered theoretical studies on the subject throughout the past decade . in heavy flavor physics this issue has received comparatively less attention .",
    "however , experiments at b and charm factories are approaching ( in some channels ) an accuracy level that requires a satisfactory understanding of radiative effects .    in this",
    "talk i review the theoretical framework for the study of rc to meson decays and describe recent theoretical efforts to obtain model - independent results despite the complications due to strong interactions .",
    "within the standard model ( and its extensions ) weak decays of mesons are studied via an effective lagrangian which factorizes the short- and long - distance physics : @xmath2 the wilson coefficients @xmath3 encode information on short - distance degrees of freedom ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 masses , for example ) , while the local dimension - six operators @xmath7 are constructed out of `` light '' fields ( quarks , leptons , gluons , photons ) .    in this framework ,",
    "radiative corrections are accounted for by keeping track of @xmath8 effects in the calculation of both wilson coefficients and hadronic matrix elements @xmath9 , eventually resulting in @xmath8 corrections to the decay rate @xmath10 .",
    "the effective lagrangian framework leads to a natural separation into short- and long - distance corrections .",

    "corrections to the wilson coefficients are calculated in perturbation theory and are by now well known for both semi - leptonic  @xcite and non - leptonic  @xcite operators .",

    "+ ( ii ) _ long distance _ ( ld )",
    "corrections in general can not be calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath9 pose great challenges already without inclusion of @xmath8 effects , i.e. without virtual photons .",
    "rigorous results can be obtained only in certain ranges of external momenta , corresponding to various hadronic effective field theories ( eft ) , for example chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , heavy hadron chpt ( hhchpt ) . in these cases it is possible",
    "to at least formally match from the quark - level to the hadronic eft , thus generating @xmath8 effective hadronic vertices without introduction of large logarithms .    despite the hadronic uncertainties , an important class of long distance corrections , the infrared ( ir ) effects ,",
    "can be treated in a model - independent way .",
    "ir photons are defined as those with a wavelength much larger than the typical size of hadrons and therefore are not sensitive to the hadronic structure .",
    "their effects can be calculated in the approximation of point - like hadrons , using only gauge invariance as the guiding principle in constructing the interaction lagrangian .",
    "the calculation of virtual photon corrections in the point - like approximation leads ( as in standard qed ) to ir divergent matrix elements and decay rates .",
    "one obtains ir - finite results only for the observable _ photon - inclusive _ decay rates such as @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the typical size of long - distance corrections is then given by @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath16 the ir corrections are quite large and one needs to sum the effect to all orders in perturbation theory  @xcite .      denoting with @xmath17 the collection of independent variables characterizing the non - radiative @xmath18 decay and with @xmath19 the photon energy cut ( in general @xmath17-dependent ) , the ir safe decay distribution can be written as follows @xmath20 where @xmath21 the sum in eq .",

    "ir effects from real and virtual photons can be re - summed to all orders in perturbation theory  @xcite and result in the overall factor @xmath33 .",
    "this effect is model - independent and for @xmath34 provides the largest long - distance correction .",
