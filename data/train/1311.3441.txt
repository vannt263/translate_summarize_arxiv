    "the weak - localization approach ( wla ) has been a very popular tool to estimate whether electronic states in a weakly disordered system tend to localize or to delocalize on large scales .",
    "moreover , it enables us to calculate the magnetoresistance in the presence of a weak magnetic field and weak scattering . a central result of",
    "the wla is that on large scales there might be diffusion due to one or more massless modes .",
    "this has been studied in great detail for conventional metals @xcite and more recently for graphene @xcite and for the surface of topological insulators @xcite , using a one - band projection for the two - band system .",
    "t he existence of a diffusive mode , which is a necessary ( but not a sufficient ) condition for metallic behavior , has been debated for the one - band projected graphene model . it was found that either a single diffusive channel exists @xcite or no diffusion @xcite in the presence of generic disorder . on the other hand , the weak - scattering approach ( wsa ) , where transport properties are studied within the expansion in powers of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the scattering rate and @xmath2 is the bandwidth ) @xcite , a non - abelian chiral symmetry was identified , describing diffusion in two - band systems due to spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this is also the origin of a massless fermion mode found for 2d dirac fermions with a random gap in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the wsa disorder fluctuations of the two - band model",
    "are approximated by gaussian fluctuations around a saddle - point of the original model , expressed in terms of a functional integral @xcite .",
    "the saddle point is equivalent to the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) of the one - particle green s function , while the gaussian fluctuations are equivalent to the wla .",
    "the latter consists of one - particle and two - particle diagrams which are partially summed up in terms of geometric series ( cf .",
    "[ sect : wla ] ) . within the wsa",
    "it is also possible to analyze the fluctuations with respect to the non - abelian chiral symmetry .",
    "the projection onto these fluctuations generates a nonlinear field which allows us to go beyond the gaussian approximation within the expansion in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "this idea is analogous to the nonlinear sigma model , derived originally for one - band hamiltonians by schfer and wegner @xcite .",
    "the difference between the one - band and the two - band hamiltonians is that the former can be formulated either by a symmetric replica space or a supersymmetric fermion - boson @xcite , whereas the latter can be expressed in terms of a non - symmetric fermion - boson theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the derivation of a nonlinear sigma model it is crucial to take the two - band structure into account .",
    "a projection onto a single band would destroy the relevant symmetries of the system .",
    "in more physical terms , the two - band structure is essential for supporting diffusion in a two - dimensional system , since it allows for klein tunneling .",
    "the latter enables a particle in a potential barrier to transmute to a hole , for which the potential barrier is not an obstacle .",
    "our aim is to establish a direct connection between the wla and the gaussian fluctuations around the saddle point for 2d dirac fermions with a random gap , and to provide a general discussion about the existence of diffusive modes due to ladder and maximally crossed contributions in two - band systems .",
    "finally , these results will be employed to calculate the conductivity corrections , and the resulting conductivities will be compared with experimental measurements in graphene .",

    "<S> the appearance of diffusive modes depends on the type of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find for a random gap a diffusive mode only from ladder contributions , whereas for a random scalar potential the diffusive mode is created by ladder and by maximally crossed contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the ladder ( maximally crossed ) contributions correspond to fermionic ( bosonic ) gaussian fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the conductivity corrections from the density  density kubo formula and find a good agreement with the experimentally observed v - shape conductivity of graphene . </S>"
