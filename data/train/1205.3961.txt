    "geometrically frustrated magnetic materials with competing spin interactions give rise to macroscopic degeneracy of ground state .",
    "they have displayed abundant exotic magnetic phenomena and introduced important concepts to condensed matter physics.@xcite the recently discovered rare - earth langasites , @xmath8ga@xmath1sio@xmath2 ( @xmath9 = nd , pr ) , with two - dimensional geometrical frustration have attracted much attention due to their possible spin - liquid state.@xcite    nd@xmath0ga@xmath1sio@xmath2 ( ngso ) crystallizes in the trigonal space group @xmath10321 , and nd@xmath11 spins ( @xmath12 ) occupy a network of corner - sharing triangles , forming a distorted kagom - like lattice in the @xmath6 plane stacked along the @xmath4 axis , which is topologically equivalent to a perfect one when only the nearest - neighboring interaction is considered.@xcite the magnetic anisotropy associated with crystal field effect was confirmed from the magnetic susceptibility and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements , which displayed a distinct crossover from the easy plane ( kagom plane ) to the easy axis ( @xmath4 axis ) below 33 k.@xcite the experimental investigations on the ground state of ngso seemed to be rather confusing . the muon spin relaxation ( @xmath13sr ) and neutron scattering experiments did not detect any phase transition or long - range magnetic order down to millikelvin temperatures in zero field.@xcite in some earlier works , the magnetic susceptibility showed that the curie - weiss temperature is about -52 k or -62 k and therefore the frustration factor is large ( @xmath14 ) , indicating a spin - liquid ground state with rather strong spin interactions.@xcite however , by measuring the low - lying crystal - field levels of nd@xmath11 via the magneto - optical spectroscopy , it was found that the exchange interaction of nd@xmath11 spins is surprisingly small , leading to a revised frustration factor of @xmath15 1.@xcite this finding is essentially consistent with the single - ion quantum relaxation at low temperatures revealed by the neutron scattering.@xcite these results ruled out ngso as a spin liquid at least down to 100 mk .",
    "so the ground state of ngso remains to be fully understood .",
    "in addition , the effect of magnetic field on the ground state of ngso has been probed by magnetization and neutron scattering measurements.@xcite at 1.6 k , the magnetization for @xmath16 and @xmath17 showed a simple spin polarization , but the saturated moments are only half of the free nd@xmath11 moment , which is still an open question.@xcite    low - temperature heat transport has recently been found to be an effective way to probe the magnetic excitations and the field - induced quantum phase transitions.@xcite in this work , we study the heat transport properties of ngso at low temperatures down to 0.3 k and in magnetic field up to 14 t. the thermal conductivity ( @xmath3 ) shows a typical phononic heat transport behavior in zero field and at very low temperatures , while it exhibits remarkably anisotropic magnetic - field dependence .",
    "the magnetic field along the @xmath4 axis causes a low - field dip in @xmath5 isotherms and the high - field @xmath3 are the same as the zero - field values , which can be simply understood as a paramagnetic scattering on phonons . whereas the @xmath5 isotherms in magnetic field along the @xmath6 plane show sharp and step - like decreases , which indicates a field - induced magnetic transition .",
    "these transport results point to a paramagnetic ground state of ngso but a field - induced partial order for @xmath18 , which is consistent with what the low-@xmath7 specific heat data suggest .",
    "high - quality ngso single crystals are grown by the floating - zone technique in flowing argon and oxygen mixture with the ratio of 10:1.@xcite to reduce the bubble during the growth , the sintered feed rod is firstly pre - melted with a rate of 25 mm / h .",
    "then the single - crystal rods ( 5 mm in diameter and 9 mm in length ) are successfully obtained with a low growth rate of 1 mm / h . it should be noted that this fast - scan procedure is very useful to improve the quality of ngso crystals in the aspects of both the size and the crystallinity.@xcite the samples for thermal conductivity measurements are cut into parallelepiped shape with a typical size of 3 @xmath19 0.6 @xmath19 0.15 mm@xmath20 along either the @xmath21 axis or the @xmath4 axis .",
    "the thermal conductivity is measured at low temperatures down to 0.3 k using a conventional steady - state technique , which has been described in details elsewhere.@xcite the specific heat is measured by the relaxation method in the temperature range from 0.4 to 30 k using a commercial physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) .",
    "the dashed black lines show the fitting of the high-@xmath7 zero - field data by using the debye model of lattice specific heat.,width=264 ]    before presenting the heat transport results of ngso single crystals , we study the low-@xmath7 specific heat in details . figure 1 shows the temperature dependencies of the specific heat in zero field and in magnetic fields for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the zero - field specific heat shows a upturn at low temperatures below 2 k , which has been observed in previous work and is apparently of magnetic origin .",
    "the distinct peaks develop in various magnetic fields both for @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the peak position shifting to higher temperatures with increasing field .",
    "this is a characteristic behavior of the schottky anomaly , which commonly exists in many magnetic materials .",
    "the phononic specific heat can be estimated by fitting the high-@xmath7 data in zero field using the low - frequency expansion of the debye function @xmath22,@xcite as shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "1 . the best fitting gives @xmath23 j / k@xmath24mol , @xmath25 j / k@xmath26mol , and @xmath27 j / k@xmath28mol . the magnetic specific heat @xmath29 can be obtained by subtracting the lattice contribution from the total @xmath30 , as shown in fig .",
    "the schottky anomaly in ngso can be simply interpreted as the splitting of a ground - state doublet of nd@xmath11 with the effective spin @xmath31 = 1/2 .",
    "therefore , the data in magnetic fields are tried to fitted by using the two - level schottky anomaly@xcite    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the gap value for the zeeman splitting of the nd@xmath11 kramers doublet",
    ". the concentrations of free spins is @xmath34 , with @xmath9 the universal gas constant .     in field",
    "applied along ( a ) and perpendicular to ( b ) the @xmath4 axis , respectively .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the fitting results by a simple two - level schottky model .",
    "( c ) the relationship between the fitting parameter @xmath33 and magnetic field .",
    "the thin lines show linear dependencies @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively.,width=264 ]    the best fitting results using eq .",
    "( [ sh ] ) are also shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the magnetic specific heat for @xmath37 can be fitted very well using the two - level schottky anomaly , indicating that the spins behave mainly like a free system .",
    "the fitting parameter @xmath38 for @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , is in good agreement with previous results obtained from inelastic neutron scattering spectrum.@xcite another fitting parameter @xmath39 = 22.3 j / kmol is nearly @xmath40 , which indicates that almost all the nd@xmath11 moments behave like paramagnetic spins in magnetic field along the @xmath4 axis . for @xmath17 , the similar data analysis",
    "are also performed and shown in fig .",
    "the fitting parameter @xmath41 suggests the anisotropic land factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 = 20.4 j / kmol is rather consistent with the value for @xmath16 .",
    "however , it is notable that there is a pretty larger discrepancy between the fitting curves and the specific heat data at very low temperatures , particularly for @xmath42 1 t , as shown in fig .",
    "this means that at very low temperatures , there must be some other kind of magnetic contribution to the specific heat .",
    "these data suggest that the ground state of ngso is likely paramagnetic rather than spin - liquid like .",
    "the unexpected phenomenon is that the magnetic field along the @xmath6 plane induces some magnetic excitations or spin fluctuations , which indicate some kind of field - induced partial or short - range magnetic order ( no sign for long - range order in the specific heat ) .",
    "as we can see below , such kind of in - plane field induced order has remarkable impact on the low-@xmath7 heat transport .",
    "axis and the @xmath4 axis of ngso single crystals in zero field , respectively .",
    "the solid lines are the fitting results using the debye model .",
    "the inset shows the temperature dependencies of the ratio of the phonon mean free path @xmath43 to the averaged sample width @xmath44.,width=302 ]    thermal conductivity as a bulk measurement technique is a sensitive probe to all elementary excitations that carry heat or scatter heat carriers.@xcite figure 3 shows the temperature dependencies of @xmath3 with heat flowing along the @xmath21 and @xmath4 axes in zero field .",
    "both curves show phonon peaks at about 7 k , a typical feature of insulating crystals , and exhibit rather weak anisotropy . at subkelvin temperatures ,",
    "a rough @xmath45 dependence is observed , indicating that @xmath46 behaviors are close to the boundary scattering limit.@xcite in order to judge whether the phonons are free from microscopic scattering at subkelvin temperatures , we make an estimation of the mean free path @xmath43 of phonons at low temperatures.@xcite the phononic thermal conductivity can be expressed by the kinetic formula @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the phonon specific heat at low temperatures and @xmath49 is the average velocity . with @xmath50 value obtained from the above fitting of the specific - heat data , the average sound velocity @xmath49 = 2410 m / s and the debye temperature @xmath51 = 310 k are calculated by using the expression @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the volume of crystal , @xmath9 is the universal gas constant , @xmath39 is the number of molecules per mole , and @xmath55 is the number atoms in each molecule .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "3 shows the temperature dependencies of the ratio @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath44 is the averaged sample width .",
    "it is found that both the @xmath56 ratios are rather close to 1 with lowering temperature down to 0.3 k , indicating that the phonon heat transport of ngso indeed approaches the boundary scattering limit at very low temperatures and the microscopic scatterings on phonons are nearly wiped out .    for ngso ,",
    "the @xmath13sr and neutron spectroscopy revealed that the magnetic fluctuations slow down below 10 k but keep persistent down to millikelvin temperatures in zero field.@xcite however , the @xmath46 curves do not show any clear anomalies around 10 k , which suggests that the magnetic excitations do not couple with phonons .",
    "therefore , it is possible to try a more quantitative analysis on the zero - field data by using a classical debye model of phonon thermal conductivity,@xcite @xmath59 in which @xmath60 is dimensionless , @xmath61 is the phonon frequency , and @xmath62 is the mean lifetime of phonon .",
    "the phonon relaxation is usually defined as @xmath63 where the four terms represent the phonon scattering by the grain boundary , the point defects , the phonon - phonon umklapp scattering , and the resonant scattering , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath46 curves do not show clear signature of resonant scattering , the last factor can be neglected .",
    "the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath51 are obtained from the specific - heat data and other parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are free ones .",
    "it is turned out that the zero - field thermal conductivity below 25 k is well simulated as the blue lines shown in fig .",
    "3 . the best fitting parameters are @xmath68 m , @xmath69 s@xmath20 , @xmath70 k@xmath71s@xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 m , @xmath75 s@xmath20 , @xmath76 k@xmath71s@xmath72 , @xmath77 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath64 are found to be in good consistent with the averaged sample widths of these two samples , which are @xmath78 m ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath79 m ( @xmath58 ) , respectively .",
    "note that the failure of fitting at @xmath80 25 k can be related to either the magnetic fluctuations or the contributions of optical phonons.@xcite however , these complexities at relatively high temperatures are not involved in the following discussion about the magnetic - field effect on low-@xmath7 heat transport .",
    "( b ) the calculation results of @xmath5 isotherms using the debye model.,width=264 ]    detailed magnetic - field dependencies of the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity can provide useful information on the nature of the ground state .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the detailed magnetic field dependencies of @xmath57 for @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath5 are strongly suppressed down to about 50% at low magnetic field and are recovered at high magnetic field , yielding a dip - like feature . note that the position of the minimum moves to high magnetic field as increasing temperature . based on the schottky contribution to the low-@xmath7 specific heat",
    ", the dip - like behaviors of @xmath5 can be attributed to the phonon scattering by the paramagnetic moments , that is , the field - induced splitting of nd@xmath11 kramers doublet can cause a resonant scattering on phonons , as we previously observed in pr@xmath81la@xmath82cuo@xmath83 and gdbaco@xmath84o@xmath85.@xcite the zeeman splitting of the spin doublet is known from the above fitting of schottky anomaly for @xmath16 , which gives @xmath86 .",
    "we can simulate the magnetic - field dependencies of @xmath5 by using the debye model for phonon thermal conductivity,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "one can see that most of @xmath5 isotherms are in good agreement with the calculated ones except for some deviations for the high-@xmath7 data , which might be due to the excitations of the higher - energy crystal field levels .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4-axis magnetic field seems to affect the heat transport mainly by introducing some paramagnetic scattering on phonons .",
    "this is in good correspondence with what the specific - heat data suggest .",
    "it is worthy of pointing out that the @xmath87 isotherms for @xmath16 are the same as those of @xmath88 shown in fig .",
    "4 .     ( a ) and @xmath58 ( b ) of ngso single crystals at low temperatures with magnetic field perpendicular to the @xmath4 axis.,width=264 ]",
    "the above paramagnetic scattering effect is known to be qualitatively isotropic for magnetic field along different directions.@xcite however , the heat transport behaves very differently if the magnetic field is applied in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "figure 5 shows the magnetic - field dependencies of both @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath89 .",
    "it is easily found that the @xmath5 behaviors are essentially the same for different directions of heat current .",
    "all the @xmath5 isotherms show significant suppression down to 1020% of the zero - field value . with lowering temperature , the decrease of @xmath3 becomes sharper at low fields . if a dip - like @xmath5 term from the paramagnetic scattering effect is also included , the field dependence of fig .",
    "5 apparently has another contribution .",
    "this can be clarified by a simple analysis . as some examples shown in fig . 6 ( similar analysis can be done for other data ) , the changes of @xmath57 induced by paramagnetic scattering are calculated in the same way as that for @xmath16 , considering @xmath90 .",
    "then subtracting this part of change from the raw data of @xmath88 , the other contribution to the field dependence can be roughly estimated .",
    "it can be seen that at low temperatures , this additional term is actually a step - like suppression , which suggests that the @xmath6-plane field induces some magnetic transition .",
    "this is compatible with what the specific - heat data signify , as discussed above .",
    "although the quantitative description of the phonon scattering by the magnetic excitations in such a broad temperature region is not available now , the qualitative understanding can be easily figured out . apparently , the field - induced partial or short - range order causes strong dynamic spin fluctuations that can strongly scatter phonons .     at 0.36 k ( a ) and 0.5 k ( b ) for @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath91 is defined as @xmath92 .",
    "the solid symbols indicate the experimental data .",
    "the solid blue lines represent the calculated changes of @xmath3 by the paramagnetic scattering , denoted as @xmath93 .",
    "the open symbols show the results of subtracting the paramagnetic scattering term from the raw data , denoted as @xmath94 , which is discussed to be related to some kind of field - induced magnetic order.,width=264 ]    it should be pointed out that the in - plane field induced partial order , suggested by the specific heat and thermal conductivity data in the present work , however , has not been evidenced in the earlier works .",
    "it is known that the low-@xmath7 magnetization showed a simple spin polarization above @xmath15 2 t for both @xmath37 and @xmath17,@xcite and the neutron scattering also confirmed this phenomenon for @xmath95.@xcite but the moments of the high - field @xmath96 plateau are only half of the free nd@xmath11 moment , which is an open question for the existing theories on the kagom antiferromagnet.@xcite there have been no other experimental investigation about the details for @xmath97 . here , we propose one possibility that when the nd@xmath11 moments are gradually aligned along the in - plane field , the @xmath4-axis component of nd@xmath11 moments may form some kind of af ordering .",
    "they could be anti - parallel either for the neighboring sites or for the neighboring layers .",
    "this picture is not inconsistent with the experimental results that the high - field @xmath96 plateau is lower for @xmath17 than that for @xmath95.@xcite nevertheless , the validity of this canted af order and the underlying mechanism , which should be related to the spin anisotropy , the crystal field effect , and the spin frustration , calls for a deeper investigation .",
    "in summary , the temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the thermal conductivity and specific heat are studied for ngso single crystals .",
    "the zero - field thermal conductivity shows a purely phononic heat transport behavior at low temperatures , without showing the strong coupling between phonons and magnetic excitations .",
    "a dip - like field dependence of @xmath3 for magnetic field along the @xmath4 axis can be explained by a simple paramagnetic scattering on phonons ; whereas a step - like field dependence of @xmath5 for @xmath17 indicates a field - induced magnetic transition at low temperatures .",
    "these behaviors are consistent with the field dependencies of low-@xmath7 specific heat .",
    "the present results demonstrate a paramagnetic ground state rather than the spin liquid .",
