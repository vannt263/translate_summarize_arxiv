    "<S> the interplay between clustering and exchange coupling in magnetic semiconductors for the prototype ( ga@xmath0,mn@xmath1)as is investigated considering manganese concentrations @xmath2 of 1/16 and 1/32 , which are in the interesting experimental range . for @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> we study all possible arrangements of two mn atoms on the ga sublattice within a large supercell and find the clustering of mn atoms at nearest - neighbour ga sites energetically preferred . </S>",
    "<S> as shown by analysis of spin density and projected density - of - states , this minimum energy configuration localizes further one hole and reduces the effective charge carrier concentration . </S>",
    "<S> also the exchange coupling constant increases to a value corresponding to lower mn concentrations with decreasing inter mn distance .    including spin information into semiconductor electronics </S>",
    "<S> has enormous potential for new applications ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a review of magnetoelectronics ) . within this field of research , </S>",
    "<S> the iii - v diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) have opened up a new chapter , in particular ( ga , mn)as is a prominent candidate for a spintronics material . </S>",
    "<S> this compound , grown by means of low - temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( lt - mbe ) , @xcite shows ferromagnetism @xcite with a curie temperature as large as 110 k in the mn concentration range between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetism ( fm ) in ( ga , mn)as is mediated by holes that are antiferromagnetically ( afm ) coupled to the mn . in spite of the tremendous theoretical effort to explain the interplay of magnetism and semiconductor properties @xcite , a number of fundamental questions still     +   +   +    remain unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> such is the so - called hole compensation problem : although the substitutional mn is a single acceptor and should introduce one hole , the observed hole concentrations are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the mn concentration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this hole compenation has been abscribed to intrinsic defects such as mn interstitials @xcite and as antisites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the antisite concentrations are small , interstitial mn has a high formation energy compared with substitutional mn @xcite , and the interstitial mn has a rather low migration barrier so annealing will reduce interstitial concentrations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , after growth condition optimization and thermal annealing the hole compensation can not completely be eliminated , and long - time annealing reduces further the hole concentration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the hypothetical defect - free ( ga@xmath0,mn@xmath1)as and consider hole compensation due to intrinsic properties of the substitutional mn and the spin - polarized holes , bonding and localization effects . in this letter we present first principles calculations for magnetic semiconductors . within the density - functional theory we test all - electron methods , the full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method @xcite and the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method @xcite , as well as a plane wave pseudopotential ( pwpp ) method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also test the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) beyond the local spin density ( lsd ) approximation@xcite for the exchange - correlation functional . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate mn clustering in ( ga , mn)as within the supercell approach ( see fig.[fig : geometry ] describing the considered cases ) , which gives us hints as to comment on hole localization . </S>",
    "<S> based on the clustering results , we reexamine the findings of previous calculations that address the role of the exchange coupling parameter within mean - field theories .    as a benchmark we study zincblende mnas which is a bulk equivalent to the substitutional mn in gaas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to ensure convergence in energy and magnetic moment with respect to k - points and cutoff parameters , especially the structure of the density - of - states ( dos ) was monitored .    </S>",
    "<S> .equilibrium lattice constant and electronic behaviour for the zincblende mnas structure . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations have been done within several density - functional methods with different treatments : i ) for the atom potential ( flapw- and paw- full potential ; pwpp- pseudopotentials ) ; ii ) or for the correlation approximation ( gga- generalized gradient approximation ; lsd- local spin density approximation ) . [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    we see in table [ tab : test ] obvious differences between our full - potential and pseudopotential calculations for the lattice constants between gga and lsd results . </S>",
    "<S> they show errors of the order of 0.1  , which are far from negligible because one is near the transition from metallic behaviour to a half - metallic state . </S>",
    "<S> both the lattice constants as well as the electronic behaviour show differences with respect to previous calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the differences concerning pseudopotential calculations might be ascribed to the used pseudopotentials , while the difference with previous full - potential calculations sounds more puzzling . to correctly observe the metallic or half - metallic behaviour , a denser mesh beyond a typical semiconductor k - point sampling </S>",
    "<S> is required . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the intrinsic pseudopotential differences , the k - point consideration remains also as the main difference with respect to previous pseudopotential calculations ( see fig 4 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the magnetization shows spurious jumps with the distance ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tests clearly show that calculations must be carried out within all - electron methods and the gga . </S>",
    "<S> the paw calculations are computationally nearly as efficient as the pwpp ones , so the paw gga approach is employed henceforth . </S>",
    "<S> we have made simulations of ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as with x= 1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 where the notation of @xmath2 means @xmath8 in the supercell . </S>",
    "<S> naturally the size of the supercell is twice the number of as sites . </S>",
    "<S> we only consider substitutional mn in the ga sublattice , and focus on the clustering process of 2 mn atoms in the high curie temperature region of @xmath9 . here </S>",
    "<S> we include 2 mn atoms in the 64 atom supercell ( _ i.e. _ @xmath10 ) and calculate all five possible mn arrangements corresponding to different mn - mn distances , as shown in fig [ fig : geometry ] . </S>",
    "<S> again we test for convergence with respect to the number of k - points and cutoff parameters : for the 64 atom supercell a 4x4x4 mesh including the @xmath11 point is sufficient to sample the brillouin zone , and plane waves up to the cutoff of 275 ev give converged results . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice atoms are relaxed so that the forces in the system are lower than 0.02 ev /  .    </S>",
    "<S> first we investigate the clustering process of mn on the ga sublattice . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geometry ] the geometries are ordered according to their energy . </S>",
    "<S> the energetic order depends on the mn - mn atom distance except for the `` edge '' configuration . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to remark that the nearest neighbour configuration has the lowest energy which indicates clustering , as also predicted using the atomic sphere approximation for the potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this clustering could play a role in the magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the energetic differences @xmath12 between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations , _ i.e. _ two mn with parallel or antiparallel magnetic moments , are also given in parenthesis in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geometry ] . tests on larger supercells showed that @xmath12 is independent of supercell size . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic ground state of all the configurations is ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4 @xmath13 per mn atom in the unit cell , as for the homogenous case in ref @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 values increase when decreasing the mn - mn distance . for the edge configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 is considerably smaller than in the other configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration constitutes an exception because the as atoms are in a more open structure , which enables direct afm coupling between the two mn atoms . considering the other cases , even for the larger distances , in the homogenous distribution , the values @xmath12 are large compared with similar materials @xcite . when neglecting the barriers involved in the process , the energies required by the mn to jump between different ga sites are smaller than the energies required to flip the spins . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , the growth under strong magnetic fields should affect the final atomic configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> next we focus on the hole localization seen in the spin - density as well as the density of states ( dos ) , and look for quantifications by integrating over both spin - density and dos . the spin polarized charge density for the nearest neighbour and homogeneous case is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : charge ] a and b. the negative spin density in the n - n configuration is more concentrated around the as nuclei than in the homogeneous one , especially around the as atom shared as first neighbour by both mn atoms . as fm </S>",
    "<S> is mediated by holes which are afm coupled to mn atoms , the negative spin density points out the hole density . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this localization of negative spin density implies that the holes undergo strong localization in the n - n case .    </S>",
    "<S> this dimer - induced hole localization is further clarified in the dos shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : charge ] c and d , where the @xmath14-like hole states split into bonding and antibonding states . </S>",
    "<S> since we are discussing hole states , the behaviour is opposite to electronic states , i.e. the bonding - like hole states are higher in energy ( deeper in the gap , larger effective mass and higher localization ) . from the orbital projected dos ( pdos ) </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the as @xmath15 states around the in - between - as ( green curve ) provide a significant contribution to the dos in the unoccupied region . in homogeneous case </S>",
    "<S> the unoccupied states correspond to antibonding @xmath16 states that account for the mn induced itinerant hole states responsible for ferromagnetism ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in the n - n configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 symmetry break splits the @xmath16 state into an antibonding state and a bonding like state deeper in the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the deeper state , according to pdos analysis , is localized around the in - between - as , and therefore we are left only with one itinerant @xmath16 like hole state , reducing the effective carrier concentration by one half .    for a quantative measure of </S>",
    "<S> how the holes are distributed on atomic orbitals we integrate the pdos over the unoccupied valence band states ; the absolute values depend on the basis set used , projection details etc . , but </S>",
    "<S> relative values provide useful information when comparing different systems . in the dimer configuration </S>",
    "<S> we observe 0.1 , 0.05 and 0.03 unoccupied @xmath15 states on the in - between - as ( green ) , the end - as ( turquoise ) and the vertical - as ( blue ) , respectively following notation in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . in case of the homogeneous distribution , </S>",
    "<S> we observe 0.04 unoccupied @xmath15 states on the as next to mn . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare the integrated hole densities with magnetization around as ( _ i.e. _ spin - density integrated inside sphere ) : in the dimer configuration we observe values of -0.077 @xmath13 , -0.032 @xmath13 and -0.009 @xmath13 around the in - between - as , end - as and vertical - as , respectively , while in the homogeneous case the magnetization of the as next to mn is -0.025 @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the similar values for unoccupied as @xmath15 states and as magnetization confirm that the negative spin - density actually is correlated with the hole density . </S>",
    "<S> notice than both values on the in - between - as get over twice the ones in the homogenous case , which is a non - negligible quantity . </S>",
    "<S> thus this hole localization mechanism seen both in spin density and dos , combined with the lowered energy in the n - n configuration is a significant addition to the previously known mechanisms that reduce the effective carrier concentration . with this finding </S>",
    "<S> we give a possible explanation why only a fraction of the mn align ferromagnetically and why a large number of holes is lost , even when we are limited to only mn in substitutional positions .    </S>",
    "<S> the change of dos and the charge polarization for the different configurations drives us to address the same issues for the exchange coupling parameter @xmath17 , which is crucial in the calculation of thermodynamic properties @xcite . following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the effect of the sp - d exchange on the band structure of the host semiconductor can be related with the spin splitting at the gamma point . </S>",
    "<S> although both conduction as well as valence band splitting can be considered , we concentrate only on the @xmath17 parameter because it shows largest changes with the inclusion of magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the valence exchange coupling constant can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the valence band edge spin splitting at the @xmath11 point , and the mean field spin @xmath20 is half of the computed magnetization per mn ion . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally this constant is extracted from the exciton band that is spin split in optical magnetoabsorption experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our estimated exchange couplings are given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : splitting ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath21 for both concentrations shows values between 5.6 - 6.8 ev . with respect to previous pwpp results , 5.48 ev for x=1/16 and 7.34 ev for x=1/32 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath21 does not depend strongly on the mn concentration . for the concentration @xmath22 the @xmath23 parameter for several mn configurations increases as the longest distance between mn atoms increases . </S>",
    "<S> its value approaches that of the smaller concentration x=1/32 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the longest mn - mn distance sets the exchange over the whole semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> a simple mean - field model might after all be justified when re - interpreting the exchange constant in terms of holes ascribed both to mn as well as mn dimers , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the mn dimer should be treated like a single mn impurity . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the exchange is mediated by the itinerant holes , and as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : charge ] d , in the n - n case the two mn as a total contribute only one @xmath16 like itinerant hole . </S>",
    "<S> all these findings suggest that the breakdown of the mean field approximation is not yet well established , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ a mean field scheme may be justified by including this clustering process .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we see that disorder has strong effect on the ferromagnetic coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the preferred structural configuration is a dimer of two mn occupying nearest neighbour ga sites . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration localizes a hole and explains in part the reduced carrier concentration observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> further , our results suggest that the analysis of the breakdown in the mean field approximation should be reconsidered .    </S>",
