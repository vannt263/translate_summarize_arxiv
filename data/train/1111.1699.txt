    "cp - violation is a necessary ingredient for the generation of the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe and understanding its origin , both within and beyond the standard model , is one of the primary goals of particle physics research .",
    "it was first discovered in the decays of kaons into two pions , and in this paper we report on a calculation of the amplitude @xmath0 for @xmath9 decays from first principles .",
    "( bose symmetry implies that the two - pion eigenstates have isospin 0 or 2 and we denote the corresponding complex amplitudes by @xmath4 and @xmath0 . ) for re@xmath0 we find good agreement with the known experimental value ( see eq.([eq : resultsrea2 ] ) ) and , more importantly , we are also able to determine the previously unknown quantity im@xmath0 ( eq.([eq : resultsima2 ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath0 is obtained by combining our lattice results for matrix elements of the four - quark operators in the effective hamiltonian ( the matrix elements are given in eqs.([eq : m271])-([eq : m88mix ] ) ) with wilson coefficients and ckm - matrix elements .",
    "in addition , within the standard model we can combine our result for im@xmath0 with the experimental values of re@xmath4 , re@xmath0 and @xmath5 to determine the remaining unknown quantity im@xmath4 , so that both the complex amplitudes @xmath4 and @xmath0 are now known .",
    "this is the first quantitative determination of an amplitude for a realistic hadronic weak decay and extends the framework of lattice qcd into the important domain of non - leptonic weak decays .",
    "it has taken several decades for a realistic lattice qcd calculation of @xmath9 decay amplitudes to become possible because very significant theoretical developments and technical progress were required .",
    "these are briefly discussed below and explained in more detail in  @xcite , where a full description of our calculation can be found . among the key issues",
    "is the fact that performing the simulations in euclidean space makes the evaluation of @xmath10 rescattering effects non - trivial .",
    "the presence of two pions interacting strongly in a finite box leads to finite - volume effects which must be controlled  @xcite .",
    "in fact the effects of finite volume can be exploited to ensure the equality of the energies of the initial kaon and final two - pion states by the imposition of carefully devised boundary conditions . finally , it is only relatively recently , with the improvement of algorithms and access to teraflops - scale computing resources , that it has become possible to perform simulations at physical @xmath11 and @xmath12-quark masses .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 is also important in that it determines the @xmath13 contribution of direct cp violation to @xmath14  @xcite , a level of precision which has become relevant due to the major recent improvements in the evaluation of the @xmath15 parameter with an uncertainty of less than 3% , see e.g.  @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , a complete understanding of cp - violation in @xmath16 decays , including the evaluation of @xmath17 and an understanding of the @xmath18 rule , requires the ability to compute both @xmath4 and @xmath0 directly .",
    "the present calculation is an important milestone on the road to achieving this . for @xmath4",
    "however , the two pions have vacuum quantum numbers and the correlation functions are dominated by the vacuum intermediate state .",
    "we report on our exploratory work in developing techniques for the efficient subtraction of the vacuum contributions in  @xcite and look forward to presenting results of a realistic computation of @xmath4 in the future .",
    "the simulations were performed using domain wall fermions ( dwf ) with a gauge action which we call idsdr .",
    "this is the iwasaki action modified by a weighting factor , called the dislocation suppressing determinant ratio ( dsdr )  @xcite , which allows us to suppress configurations with large numbers of modes of the 5-dimensional dwf transfer matrix with near unit eigenvalue while retaining adequate topological change .",
    "this modification is necessary since we have a relatively large lattice spacing @xmath19 which increases the frequency of dislocations which break the chiral symmetry .",
    "we have generated two ensembles of @xmath20 flavor dwf with the idsdr gauge action at @xmath21 and a lattice size of @xmath22 , where the final number is the length of the fifth dimension .",
    "we determine the residual mass to be @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "( masses written without units are to be understood as being in lattice units . )",
    "the ensembles are generated with a simulated strange - quark mass of @xmath24 and light - quark masses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with corresponding unitary pion masses of approximately @xmath27mev and @xmath28mev respectively .",
    "quark propagators are generated for a range of valence masses .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is performed using 63 configurations from the @xmath29 ensemble , each separated by 8 molecular dynamics time units , and quark propagators with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the ( partially - quenched ) pion has a near - physical mass of approximately @xmath32mev .",
    "a subsequent detailed analysis with greater statistics and improved procedures have yielded a slightly lower value for the bare physical strange quark mass ( 0.0464(7 ) )  @xcite .",
    "we obtain the lattice spacing and the two physical quark masses @xmath33 and @xmath34 using a combined analysis of these idsdr ensembles and our @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 domain wall fermion configurations with the iwasaki gauge action  @xcite .",
    "this involves a combined fit of pion and kaon masses and decay constants and the mass of the @xmath39-baryon as functions of the quark masses and lattice spacing .",
    "we extrapolate to the continuum limit along a family of scaling trajectories defined by constant values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42  @xcite . in our fits",
    "we take the lattice artefacts to be @xmath43 as expected and note that the coefficients of the @xmath44 terms are not equal for the two different lattice actions . from the combined chiral and continuum fits we obtain for the idsdr ensembles @xmath45gev and physical quark masses of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in lattice units , which correspond to @xmath48mev and @xmath49=95.1(3.0)mev .",
    "( here @xmath50 . )",
    "in order to ensure that the energy of the two - pion final state ( in the rest - frame of the kaon ) is ( almost ) equal to @xmath41 , we have carefully chosen both the volume of the lattice and the boundary conditions on the quark fields .",
    "with periodic boundary conditions , the two - pion ground state corresponds to each pion being at rest ( up to finite - volume corrections ) so for the physical decay we would need to consider an excited state  @xcite .",
    "instead we introduce antiperiodic spatial boundary conditions for some components of the @xmath12-quark s momentum , so that the corresponding components of the momentum of a @xmath51 meson are odd - integer multiples of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the spatial extent of the lattice ) .",
    "there is now no state with both pions at rest .",
    "this is not sufficient however , since the physical decay @xmath54 involves a @xmath55 which , even with antiperiodic boundary conditions on the @xmath12-quark , has momentum components which are integer multiples of @xmath56 .",
    "it is therefore not possible to construct the @xmath57 state at rest .",
    "these problems are overcome by using isospin symmetry and the wigner - eckart theorem to relate the matrix elements for the decay @xmath54 to those for the unphysical process @xmath58 : @xmath59 an approach proposed and first explored in @xcite . the superscripts and subscripts on the operators",
    "@xmath60 denote how the total isospin i and the z - component @xmath61 change between initial and final state . neglecting violations of isospin symmetry , ( [ eq : wigner_eckart ] )",
    "is exact and so we can use the two-@xmath51 state to calculate the physical @xmath62 decay amplitudes . in this way we are able to avoid the need to consider an excited state and at the same time we reduce the required size of the lattice .",
    "the kaon and pion masses and the energy of the two - pion state in the simulation , together with the corresponding physical values are presented in tab.[tab : masses ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our result for im@xmath63 can be combined with the experimental results for re@xmath0 , re@xmath64gev and @xmath5 to obtain the unknown ratio : @xmath65 this ratio allows us to determine in full qcd the effect of direct cp violation in @xmath66 on @xmath14 , customarily denoted by @xmath67 @xcite , @xmath68 . where the subscript ",
    "abs \" denotes that at present only the absorptive long - distance contribution ( i m @xmath69 ) is included  @xcite ( the error is now dominated by the experimental uncertainty in @xmath5 ) . the analogous contribution from the dispersive part ( i m @xmath70 )  @xcite is yet to be determined in lattice qcd , but we describe progress towards being able to do this in  @xcite .    using our value of im@xmath63 in eq.([eq : resultsima2 ] ) and taking the experimental value given above for re@xmath0 from @xmath71 decays we obtain the ewp contribution to @xmath5 , re@xmath8 .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculation of the complex @xmath9 decay amplitude @xmath0 described above builds upon substantial theoretical advances , achieved over many years as outlined in the introduction .",
    "it is encouraging that the value we find for re@xmath0 is in good agreement with experiment and we are also able to determine im@xmath0 for the first time .",
    "it will be important to repeat this calculation using a second lattice spacing so that a continuum extrapolation can be performed thus eliminating the dominant contribution to the error , reducing the total uncertainty to about 5% .",
    "we expect that the dominant remaining errors in @xmath0 will then come from the omission of electromagnetic and other isospin breaking mixing between the large amplitude @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "much more challenging but of even greater interest is the application of these methods to the evaluation of @xmath4 allowing for a calculation of @xmath5 and an understanding of the @xmath18 rule .",
    "although the framework presented here will also support the calculation of @xmath4 , serious obstacles must be overcome .",
    "much larger monte carlo samples will be required to remove the large fluctuations remaining after the contribution of the vacuum state has been removed .",
    "the anti - periodic boundary conditions for the @xmath12-quark field used in this paper can not be applied to the @xmath72 @xmath10  state .",
    "instead more sophisticated boundary conditions , mixing quarks and anti - quarks and an isospin rotation , ( _ g - parity _ boundary conditions )  @xcite , must be used for both the valence and the sea quarks .",
    "exploratory studies  @xcite suggest that obtaining adequate statistics will be practical with the next generation of machines which will become available to our collaboration within the next few months .",
    "we thank r.arthur for help with generating the non - perturbative renormalization data and a.buras for helpful discussions and support .",
