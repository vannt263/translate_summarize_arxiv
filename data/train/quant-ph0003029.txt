    "the idea of controlling the coherent dynamics of a quantum system by an external time - dependent force has found wide spread experimental and theoretical interest in many areas of physics ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "it is , e.g. , a commonly used tool to manipulate trapped atoms in quantum optics @xcite as well as to control chemical reactions by a strong laser field @xcite . in the context of quantum optics , it has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite that a frequency - modulated excitation of a two - level atom by use of a microwave field driving transitions between two rydberg stark states of potassium significantly modifies the time evolution of the system . in the context of tunneling systems",
    "it has also been demonstrated that it is in principle possible to completely suppress the coherent tunneling of an initially localized wave packet in a double - well potential by an external , suitably designed time - periodic cw - perturbation ( _ coherent destruction of tunneling _ ) @xcite .    however , real quantum systems are always in contact with their environment .",
    "the coherent dynamics is then usually destroyed due to the influence of the large number of environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "not only the phase of the quantum system is disturbed ( decoherence ) @xcite but also energy exchange ( dissipation ) @xcite takes place between the system under consideration and the environment .",
    "an example of such a system - bath interaction is the ensemble of electromagnetic field modes in a cavity , each of which is described as a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "each mode interacts with an atom trapped in the cavity . on the other side ,",
    "the cavity modes themselves are also not isolated from the macroscopic environment ; as such they are more realistically described as damped quantum harmonic oscillators .",
    "a topic of fundamental interest is the decay of quantum superpositions of states .",
    "in @xcite it is shown how quantum optical nonclassical states are highly sensitive to dissipation stemming from a zero - temperature heat bath .",
    "experimental works studying decoherence systematically are rare . in @xcite",
    "the decoherence of mesoscopic superpositions of field states in the cavity has been investigated . in a recent work ,",
    "wineland and collaborators @xcite demonstrate that the decoherence rate scales with the square of a quantity that describes the separation between two initial states .",
    "moreover , knight and co - workers @xcite proposed an experimental scheme to probe the decoherence of a macroscopic object .    in this spirit , the question arises to which extent it is possible to control the dynamics of a quantum system in presence of decoherence and , moreover , whether the effect of decoherence can be minimized by an external time - dependent force , e.g. , by a laser field @xcite . to achieve this goal ,",
    "various approaches have been undertaken in recent years .",
    "( i ) it has been shown that the effect of coherent destruction of tunneling ( see above ) can be used to _ slow down _ the relaxation of a quantum system to its asymptotic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "( ii ) moreover , a suitable tailored sequence of radio - frequency pulses ( `` quantum bang - bang '' @xcite or `` parity kicks '' @xcite ) that repeatedly flip the state of a two - level atom may be used to suppress decoherence . (",
    "iii ) the cavity - induced spontaneous emission of a two - level atom can be manipulated by a strong rf field which couples to the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the manipulation of the system - bath interaction by a fast frequency modulation also results in slowing down decoherence and relaxation @xcite .",
    "the objective of this work is to study the influence of a time - periodic driving field on the dynamics of a two - level atom . in the first part of this work ( section [ nodissipation ] )",
    ", we deal with the objective to `` freeze '' a coherent dynamics , i.e. , we shall employ an effect known as coherent destruction of tunneling .",
    "most importantly , we investigate this freezing phenomenon from the viewpoint of its dependence on different initial preparations .    in the second part of this work ( section [ dissipation ] )",
    ", we do not elaborate further on the effect of coherent destruction tunneling , but instead investigate the control of decoherence of a two - level atom placed in a lossy cavity .",
    "our model consists of a two - state system which is coupled to a time - dependent periodic field .",
    "the driven two - state system interacts furthermore with one mode of the cavity having the frequency @xmath0 .",
    "this mode is itself damped by the coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators ( _ lossy cavity _ ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that a hamiltonian consisting of ( 1 ) a system part , ( 2 ) a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath1 that is being coupled to the system , and ( 3 ) a bath of harmonic oscillators which are coupled to this very single harmonic oscillator can be mapped onto a hamiltonian composed of the system part coupled to a harmonic bath with an effective spectral density .",
    "this effective spectral density possesses a lorentzian - shaped peak at @xmath0 .",
    "the completely isolated atom ( no driving , no cavity ) evolves in time in a coherent way according to the schrdinger equation .",
    "it is this dynamics which we want to preserve and protect as far as possible from the decoherent influence of the environment .",
    "our major finding is that a cw - control field can indeed be used to ( i ) reduce decoherence and ( ii ) to restore to some extent the unperturbed , non - dissipative time - evolution .",
    "to start we consider a hamiltonian describing a two - level atom with the ground state @xmath2 and an excited state @xmath3 .",
    "the energy levels are separated by the energy @xmath4 .",
    "the atom with the transition dipole moment @xmath5 is driven within the long wavelength approximation by an external , time - dependent laser field of the form @xmath6 with frequency @xmath7 and amplitude @xmath8 , yielding the driven quantum system @xmath9   \\ , .",

    "the part involving @xmath11 with @xmath12 presents the time - dependent driving which couples to the transition dipole moment @xmath5 of the atom .",
    "note that within this scaling the amplitude @xmath13 possesses the dimension of a frequency .",
    "the driven time evolution of the populations of the energy levels exhibits an oscillatory behaviour . for an initial preparation of the atom in the ground state and for a resonant driving , i.  e.   @xmath14 , and with @xmath13 not large we can invoke the rotating wave approximation .",
    "the population of each state then oscillates between 0 and 1 with the rabi frequency @xmath15 . because the hamiltonian ( [ drivtls ] ) is periodic in time with the period @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17",
    ", we next apply for the general case away from resonance the floquet formalism @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation may be written as @xmath18 according to the floquet theorem , there exist solutions to eq .",
    "( [ schr ] ) of the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the periodic function @xmath21 are termed the floquet modes and these obey @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the so called floquet characteristic exponent or the _ quasienergy _ , which is real - valued and unique up to multiples of @xmath24 . upon substituting eq .",
    "( [ floquet1 ] ) into the schrdinger equation ( [ schr ] ) one obtains the eigenvalue equation for the quasienergy @xmath23 @xmath25 with the hermitian operator @xmath26 we stress that the floquet modes @xmath27 with @xmath28 being an integer number @xmath29 yield equivalent solutions to eq .",
    "( [ floquet1 ] ) but with the shifted quasienergy @xmath30 therefore , the index @xmath31 corresponds to a whole class of solutions indexed by @xmath32 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath33 can thus be mapped into a first brillouin zone obeying @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that for our choice of the external driving force , i.e.@xmath35 the quasienergies are functions of the driving amplitude @xmath13 and the driving frequency @xmath7 . for adiabatically vanishing external driving",
    "they merge into the eigenvalues of the time - independent part of the hamiltonian ( [ drivtls ] ) , i.e. , @xmath36 where the negative ( positive ) sign corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "the floquet modes , correspondingly , turn into the eigenfunctions @xmath38 multiplied by an additional phase factor , i.e. , @xmath39 for a finite driving strength @xmath40 , the determination of the quasienergies @xmath23 requires the use of numerical methods .",
    "the interested reader is referred in this context to the literature @xcite .",
    "however , we here state without proof that in the high - frequency regime @xmath41 $ ] the difference between the two quasienergies is given by @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the zeroth - order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "( [ cdtbessel ] ) implies a most interesting consequence for a driven two - level system @xcite : if one chooses the driving parameter @xmath13 and @xmath7 in such a way that the argument of the bessel function is at a zero of the bessel function , the splitting between the quasienergy vanishes . possible transitions between the floquet states are then at most induced by the remaining periodic time - dependent parts of the corresponding floquet modes @xmath21 .",
    "this effect has been discovered in the context of tunneling systems . there , a wave packet being an equally weighted superposition of the symmetric and antisymmetric ground state is initially localized at one side of a double - well potential . by applying an external suitably tailored periodic field ,",
    "the wave packet can be stabilized and can be prevented from coherently tunneling back and forth between the two wells , i.e. , one finds _ coherent destruction of tunneling _ ( cdt ) @xcite .",
    "we emphasize here that the crossing of two tunneling related quasienergy levels yields a _ necessary _ ( but not sufficient ) criterion for the suppression of coherent tunneling @xcite .",
    "the challenge we want to address next is as follows : how does the driven dynamics of a two level atom that is being prepared in some arbitrary initial state evolve when the corresponding condition for the parameters obey the cdt - condition ( [ cdtbessel ] ) ?",
    "the system dynamics can be described by its density operator @xmath44 , which is a @xmath45-matrix , i.e. ,    @xmath46    where the expectation values @xmath47 are the dynamical quantities of interest .",
    "@xmath48 denotes the unit matrix and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are related to the coherences ( the off - diagonal elements ) of @xmath44 while @xmath51 is the population difference between the two energy eigenstates @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the state of the quantum system at time @xmath52 is fully determined by the knowledge of the three expectation values @xmath53 . to determine the state of the driven two - level system at time @xmath52 , we consider the heisenberg equation of motion for the density matrix",
    ". using the commutation relations for the @xmath54 , we arrive at the equation of motion for the expectation values @xmath53 in ( [ twobytwo ] ) , i.e. , @xmath55 to study the dependence of the effect of coherent destruction of tunneling on the initial preparation we first choose as initial state an equally weighted coherent superposition of the two unperturbed energy eigenstates , i.e. , @xmath56 corresponding to @xmath57 .",
    "we solve the set of coupled differential equations ( [ heisi ] ) numerically by a standard fourth order runge - kutta integration algorithm with adaptive step - size control . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , the time - dependence of the three expectation values is depicted .",
    "the driving parameters are chosen such that the condition ( [ cdtbessel ] ) is fulfilled : in doing so we use   @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "surprisingly _ all three _ expectation values @xmath53 can be brought simultaneously to an almost perfect standstill !",
    "next , we choose the _ ground state _ as initial state , i.e. , we use @xmath60 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath61 .",
    "the result is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b . applying to the so prepared two - level system a laser field obeying the cdt - condition ( [ cdtbessel ] ) , we find that the y - component @xmath50 and the z - component @xmath51 exhibit strong oscillations .",
    "this oscillations follow from the numerically evaluated floquet theory for the driven two - level system , and are _ not _ described by the rabi - oscillations as predicted from a rotating wave approximation ; this latter approximation is strongly violated for our chosen set of driving parameters .",
    "in contrast , @xmath49 can be stabilized around the initial value of zero .",
    "this finding is in accordance with the cdt - phenomenon : it reflects the fact that the corresponding two equally weighted ( `` left '' and `` right '' ) localized parts of the ground state wave function of a double - well potential , as represented within a localized representation , can each be stabilized too .",
    "this cdt - effect opens the doorway to manipulate the influence of an environment on a quantum system .",
    "it is known @xcite that the coherent destruction of tunneling survives to some extent in presence of a coupling to the environment .",
    "certainly , the system will relax in presence of an environment ; however , as it is demonstrated in @xcite , the relaxation process can considerably be slowed down in the presence of a cdt - field .    in view of using differing initial preparations",
    ", the following remark should be made . from the viewpoint of stabilizing the state of a qubit ( characterized by a quantum mechanical two - level system ) in a quantum information processor @xcite , it is of foremost interest to stabilize the coherent superposition of two states of the qubit .",
    "thus , our first choice ( [ inistate ] ) is of relevance in the context of the possibility for quantum computing .",
    "moreover , fundamental questions concerning the decoherence of superposition states arise for the physics that occurs when one crosses the interface between the classical and quantum world , and vice versa @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall study the influence of an applied cw - control field for reducing decoherence of a two - level atom placed in a lossy cavity .      to start we consider a two - level atom in a dissipative environment , e.g. , a lossy cavity wherein the leakage of photons damps the radiation field .",
    "additionally , the atom may be manipulated by a time - dependent external field like a laser beam . in our model , the driven two - level atom is represented by the hamiltonian ( [ drivtls ] ) .",
    "it is coupled to one mode of the cavity which is described by one harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath0 , characterized by the annihilation and creation operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 which fulfill the usual commutation relations for bosonic field operators .",

    "the decoherence may also be slowed down , but the decohering dynamics never approaches again the initial state .",
    "these findings put the idea across that the method can be used to bring back the state of the atom close to its initial preparation . for the case ( i ) of a superposition state as initial state the decoherent dynamics of the @xmath141- and @xmath124-component @xmath142 are similar to the undriven dynamics of the isolated two - level system ( qubit ) .",
    "even the @xmath143-component @xmath140 of the driven dissipative dynamics matches at distinct instants of time the undriven non - dissipative dynamics .",
    "for the second case ( ii ) of the ground state as initial state this idea , however , seems to fail for the @xmath143-component @xmath140 .    to summarize , our proposed scheme for controlling the coherent and decoherent dynamics of a two - level atom works very well for initially prepared quantum superpositions of states .",
    "this presents good news for the manipulations of quantum bits ( two - level systems ) being in a superposition of states .",
    "it is this very feature which makes quantum computation interesting and superior to classical computation .",
