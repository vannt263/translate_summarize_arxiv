    "two - photon photoemission ( 2ppe ) has been applied intensively to study the electron - electron interaction in alkali , noble and transition metals.@xcite the experimental results are often compared with the fermi - liquid theory ( flt),@xcite but such a comparison is only valid if the influence of secondary - electron generation and transport of excited carriers is negligible .",
    "indeed , a series of 2ppe experiments involving photoexcitation of electrons from the @xmath0 band in cu have shown an unusual non - monotonic behavior of the relaxation time.@xcite the relaxation time shows a broad peak at energies just above the @xmath0-band threshold which shifts linearly with photon energy .",
    "both the non - monotonic behavior and the dependence on photon energy are incompatible with flt description or with recent calculations based on greens - function formalism.@xcite there is currently a controversy in the literature on the origin of the peak and especially on the role of secondary electrons.@xcite one of the key questions concerns the amount of auger electrons contributing to the hot - electron distribution in the region of the peak . on the basis of simple model calculations , petek _ et al .",
    "_ have estimated that the auger contribution is less than 10%,@xcite while knoesel , hotzel , and wolf could reproduce their correlation measurement by assuming that the hot electron population above the @xmath0-band threshold was entirely generated via the auger process.@xcite note that the experiments were performed using different pulse durations ( 12 and 70  fs , resp . ) .    in a previous work",
    ", we have developed a theory for the dynamics of excited electrons in metals , which includes both the effects of secondary electrons and transport .",
    "we used a boltzmann - type equation in the random-*k * approximation for the calculation of the distribution function of excited electrons .",
    "a detailed description is given in ref .  .",
    "the calculations have shown a peak in the relaxation time at the right energy reflecting the @xmath0-band threshold and a linear shift with photon frequency , in agreement with experiments .",
    "however , the height of the peak @xmath9  fs calculated using @xmath10  fs was smaller than the observed one @xmath11  fs.@xcite furthermore , a simplified procedure was used to extract the relaxation time which also led to an overestimate of the peak height . indeed for simplicity , the relaxation time was extracted by fitting the distribution of excited electrons , @xmath12 , which was very sensitive to the influence of secondary electrons causing a deviation from a simple exponential decay . to make our results more reliable ,",
    "in this work we use the same fitting procedure as the one used by experimentalists , i.e. we fit @xmath13 , given by the convolution of the probe laser profile with the distribution of excited electrons .    in this paper",
    ", we will analyze in detail the structure and height of the peak and the role of secondary electrons , especially focussing on the auger contribution and the @xmath0-hole lifetime . in order to shed light on the contribution of auger electrons,@xcite",
    "we have started by analyzing their weight in the total hot - electron distribution .",
    "for this purpose we have performed calculations for different hole lifetimes ( @xmath1 ) and laser pulse durations ( @xmath2 ) and found that their relative contribution can be expressed in a simple way as a product of a function of @xmath3 and a phase space function which is energy - dependent .",
    "in addition , we show that the height of the peak in the relaxation time depends mainly on the hole lifetime and surprisingly not on the amount of auger electrons .",
    "it will be shown that the relaxation time for energies above the @xmath0-band threshold scales linearly with @xmath1 and its structure is determined by the same phase space function as mentioned above .",
    "finally , we study how the height of the peak depends on the optical transition matrix elements and on the laser pulse duration .",
    "as said in the introduction , the composition of the hot - electron distribution in terms of different contributions ( @xmath14 for primary , auger , other secondary electrons ) is an open question .",
    "we determine their respective weight and compare the distribution of hot electrons for different cases in fig .",
    "we especially focus our attention on the variation as function of the hole lifetime at the top of the @xmath0 band , @xmath1 .",
    "the hole lifetime plays an important role , since it determines the generation rate of auger electrons which may strongly influence the dynamics of excited electrons above the fermi energy .",
    "note that in our model , the hole lifetime is the inverse of the auger scattering rate , thus we can not vary independently the hole lifetime and the amount of auger electrons generated .",
    "one should mention that experimentally , lower bounds of 24  fs and 26  fs have been reported for the hole lifetime at the top of the @xmath0 band in cu.@xcite since there is up to now no clear consensus on the value of @xmath1 , in our calculation we will consider it as a free parameter . in absence of a @xmath0 band ,",
    "the electron - hole symmetry would hold , and our calculation gives then @xmath15  fs for the hole lifetime at @xmath16  ev . due to the localized nature of the @xmath0-wave functions ,",
    "the @xmath0-hole lifetime is expected to be significantly larger than the @xmath17-hole lifetime , which will hence be considered as a reasonable lower bound .",
    "we start with the case of a laser pulse of photon energy @xmath18  ev and duration @xmath19  fs ( fwhm ) as used in ref .  .",
    "later , we will discuss the effect of changing the laser pulse duration .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) we show results of the distribution of hot electrons for different cases : with and without secondary electrons and for different hole lifetimes .",
    "we observe a peak in the primary electron distribution at @xmath20  ev which is due to the sharp feature in the @xmath0-band density of states ; at this energy , primary electrons are dominating . to simplify the discussion , in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , we plot @xmath21 for @xmath22 . in the region of the peak in @xmath23 ,",
    "the primary electron contribution is dominating , which appears now as a dip in @xmath21 . below the peak",
    ", there is a continous rise of both the auger and other secondary electron contribution . on the other hand , just above the peak , there is a sharp increase of the weight of the secondary electrons , largely dominated by the auger contribution , with a maximum at @xmath24  ev .",
    "we observe that a change of the hole lifetime leads to a significant variation of the auger contribution .",
    "for example , for @xmath25  fs , @xmath26 , whereas for shorter lifetime @xmath10  fs , @xmath27 . in our model , a shorter hole lifetime corresponds to a larger auger scattering rate and therefore to a larger amount of auger electrons . note that @xmath28 has the same shape for any given @xmath1 , only the relative amplitude is changing .",
    "this will be analyzed further when discussing the effect of the laser pulse duration .",
    "furthermore , we find that for @xmath29  ev , the contribution of secondary electrons is always negligible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the relaxation time as function of energy for different cases ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . the relaxation time is determined by a fit to the 2ppe signal as discussed in connection with fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "it will be interesting to see how the peak in the relaxation time depends on both @xmath28 and on the hole lifetime .",
    "first , we observe that when considering only primary processes ( @xmath30 ) , the relaxation time is a monontonic function , as it can be expected on the basis of flt .",
    "however , when including other secondary processes ( but no auger process ) , we immediately observe some significant changes for @xmath31  ev and some new structure at intermediate energy . when comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the changes in @xmath32 due to the presence of other secondary electrons coincide with the variation of @xmath33 discussed previously . indeed , at @xmath20  ev ( dip in @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 is almost unchanged",
    ". then a small peak appears at @xmath35  ev ( region where the secondary contribution is the highest ) , and for @xmath29  ev , @xmath30 ( negligible secondary electron contribution ) .",
    "this picture remains qualitatively unchanged when including the auger process .",
    "let us now comment on the quantitative aspect .",
    "first of all , a clear and well - defined peak is observable when @xmath1 gets sufficiently large ( typically @xmath36  fs ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for small @xmath1 ( large auger scattering rate ) , the effect is very weak , in spite of the fact that the auger contribution to the electron distribution is large [ see fig .  [",
    "fig1](b ) ] .",
    "this is a clear indication that the amplitude of the peak in @xmath34 is mainly controlled by the hole lifetime .",
    "this is indeed illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where @xmath34 at @xmath37 is plotted as function of the hole lifetime .",
    "we see clearly that @xmath34 scales linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to mention that we have found that this linear scaling behavior is also valid for other energies .",
    "this suggests that @xmath32 could be expressed as a sum of two terms , @xmath38 ( including primary and other secondary processes ) , and a term proportional to @xmath1 ( auger contribution ) , where the coefficient is a phase space factor depending on the dos only . to be more explicit ,",
    "we suggest that the relaxation time can be written as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a phase space factor defined as the ratio between a ) the available phase space for auger scattering and b ) the phase space for the optical excitation .    to test the validity of this expression , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we have plotted in the same figure @xmath41/\\tau_h$ ] as function of @xmath42 and the calculated @xmath40 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath43  ev , one can see that the values for @xmath41/\\tau_h$ ] lie almost on the same curve , which depends only on the energy .",
    "a deviation is observed for smaller energy , where auger electrons are no longer the dominant contribution to the hot - electron distribution [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "however , the position of the dip is always found at 1.1  ev . within some deviations at high and low energy ,",
    "we observe a fair agreement between @xmath40 and @xmath41/\\tau_h$ ] .",
    "note that a peak appears in @xmath40 at @xmath44  ev , whereas in @xmath41/\\tau_h$ ] , one finds only a shoulder at this position .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that by definition @xmath40 contains the explicit details of the dos , whereas the relaxation time is not so sensitive to the details of the dos .    to summarize this discussion",
    ", the important result is that the amplitude of the broad peak in @xmath32 is controlled by @xmath1 and its shape by the phase - space factor @xmath40 ( in random-*k * approximation , it depends only on the dos ) . when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .  [ fig1 ] , we find that @xmath28 is also proportional to @xmath40 , which will be commented later .    as was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the shape of the peak in the relaxation time is determined by the function @xmath40 which contains the information on the optical transition matrix elements .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we analyze how sensitively the relaxation time @xmath32 depends on the optical transition matrix elements .",
    "till now , we have presented data for the case of equal matrix elements , @xmath45 . however , on the basis of the different degree of localization of the @xmath0 and @xmath46-type wave functions , it is expected that @xmath47 should be larger than @xmath48 .",
    "for example , in the calculation of the dielectric function for ag , a ratio @xmath49 was estimated.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we have plotted @xmath32 for different values of the ratio @xmath50 . if we define the height of the peak as @xmath51 , we find that when changing @xmath52 from 1 to 2 , @xmath53 varies significantly from 9  fs to 14  fs ( increase by 60% ) .",
    "however for a further increase of @xmath52 from 2 to 4 , the change is much weaker ( 14  fs to 17  fs , increase by only 30% ) . assuming that for cu , @xmath52 is of the same order of magnitude as for ag",
    ", one can get an estimate of the hole lifetime required to get fair agreement with the observed height of the peak for polycrystalline cu , @xmath54  fs.@xcite we have found that for @xmath55 , @xmath25  fs gives @xmath7  fs . note that our results obtained in the random-*k * approximation are most suitable for comparison with experiments performed on polycrystalline material .",
    "measurements on single crystals for different orientations have provided values ranging from @xmath56 to 40  fs , which is the same order of magnitude.@xcite it is interesting to note that @xmath25  fs coincides with the value used by knoesel , hotzel , and wolf in their simulation.@xcite    note that our conclusions are not restricted to the case of cu only , but hold also in the case of other noble and transition metals .",
    "indeed , let us discuss the case of ag , au and the 3@xmath0 transition metals fe , co and ni . in the case of ag ,",
    "no peak is observed in the relaxation time,@xcite due to the fact that the @xmath0 band threshold is approximatively at 4  ev below the fermi level and no @xmath0 electrons are excited for the photon energies widely used in 2ppe experiments ( @xmath57  ev ) . the case of au is more intriguing , since the location of the @xmath0-band threshold is very similar to the one in cu . indeed , a very weak structure in the relaxation time was also observed for au.@xcite the fact that the peak in au is so weak can be attributed to the small degree of localization of the of the @xmath0 hole .",
    "it is expected that a 5@xmath0 hole in au should be less localized and therefore have a larger auger scattering rate than a 3@xmath0 hole in cu .",
    "thus one expects @xmath58 and thus in accordance with our result that the peak is governed by @xmath1 , a less pronounced structure in au than in cu .",
    "another possible explanation is the fact that the peak in the @xmath0-band dos in au is much less pronounced than in cu ( again due to the less localized @xmath0 electrons in au ) , leading to a less sharp separation between excitations from the @xmath0 and @xmath46 bands and therefore to a weaker peak .",
    "let us now comment on the fact that in the ferromagnetic transition metals fe , co and ni , no peak is observed.@xcite there are two main reasons for the absence of this feature .",
    "( i ) a threshold for @xmath59 transitions is not observable due to the band structure .",
    "the majority @xmath0 band extends to energies above @xmath60 and a @xmath59 threshold does not exist .",
    "the upper minority @xmath0 band edge is located very closely to @xmath60 and the threshold occurs only at the highest excitation energies where secondary ( auger ) electron contributions are not important .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath0 holes have a large available phase space for decay within the @xmath0 band which leads to a very short @xmath0-hole lifetime .",
    "all the results presented up to now were for @xmath19  fs .",
    "however , experiments were performed with laser pulse durations ranging from 70  fs down to 12  fs.@xcite hence , it is interesting to calculate how @xmath32 depends on @xmath2 .",
    "first , let us show that the relative weight of the auger contribution to the hot electron distribution is indeed strongly sensitive to the laser pulse duration . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we have plotted @xmath28 as a function of @xmath61 for laser pulses varying from 12 to 120  fs duration .",
    "the first observation is that when reducing the laser pulse duration for a given @xmath1 , @xmath28 is strongly reduced .",
    "for instance , for @xmath25  fs , @xmath28 goes from 3 to 0.5 ( 6 times smaller ) when reducing the laser pulse from 120 to 12  fs .",
    "this might already explain the origin of the controversy about the amount of the auger electron contribution mentioned before .",
    "it is clear that in experiments with very short laser pulses ( 12  fs in ref .  ) , the auger electron contribution is much smaller than in experiments with longer laser pulses ( 70  fs in ref .  ) . at this level",
    ", one can conclude that the laser pulse duration @xmath62 is a new relevant time scale .",
    "however , we have found that the only relevant parameter for the variation of @xmath28 is in fact @xmath63 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we have plotted @xmath28 as function of @xmath63 and we see that all the data points lie to a very good approximation on the same curve , i.e. @xmath64 . in this figure , the data are plotted for @xmath35  ev , however , it has to be stressed that this scaling is also found for higher energies .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 can be reduced to an expression of the form @xmath65 , where @xmath40 is again the phase factor discussed in the previous section .    since the relaxation time",
    "is determined from @xmath13 which contains explicitly the information about the laser pulse , let us now analyze how @xmath34 is affected by changing the pulse duration . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the dependence of the relaxation time @xmath32 on the pulse duration for durations varying from 120 to 12  fs . we observe a significant effect in the region of the peak .",
    "interestingly , the peak gets higher for the shorter pulses , although the amount of auger electrons is much smaller , see fig .",
    "note that the dependence on the pulse duration disappears for high energies , where the secondary - electron contribution is negligible . in order to understand the sensitivity to the pulse duration , in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we present the calculated @xmath66 and the fit by an exponential model function used to extract the relaxation time . we see that the agreement is very good for pulses of 120 and 70  fs duration , while there is a clear deviation from the single - exponential fit for shorter pulses of 40 and 12  fs . indeed , for the 12  fs pulse",
    ", there is a delayed rise in @xmath66 which is due to the delayed generation of auger electrons .",
    "such a delayed rise for very short laser pulses was recently observed experimentally.@xcite as an additional remark , the observed deviations underline the difficulties in extracting a relaxation time in the limit of very short pulses and indicate that maybe an improved definition of the relaxation time would be appropriate in this case .",
    "to conclude , this work presents a detailed analysis of the role of secondary electrons in 2ppe experiments on cu . the @xmath0-hole lifetime plays a crucial role .",
    "our conclusions are more general and can also be applied to other noble and transition metals as discussed .",
    "we have found that in the case of cu , the secondary - electron distribution is dominated by the auger contribution ( for @xmath67  fs ) for longer laser pulses ( @xmath68  fs ) , but not for a very short laser pulse of @xmath69  fs . for a given @xmath1 ,",
    "the auger contribution is much larger for a longer laser pulse duration than for a shorter one .",
    "the parameter which controls the variation of @xmath28 is @xmath3 . concerning the structure in the relaxation time , we have shown that the relaxation time at the peak depends linearly on @xmath1 , but surprisingly not on the amount of secondary electrons generated .",
    "the shape depends on a phase - space factor ( in random-*k * approximation , on the dos ) .",
    "we provided an expression for the relaxation time @xmath32 as a sum of two terms : the first for primary ( and other secondary ) electrons and the second for the auger contribution .",
    "we have also found that the height of the peak depends sensitively on the optical transition matrix element ratio , @xmath50 , and on the laser pulse duration . for a value of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "the calculated height of the peak is @xmath7  fs in fair agreement with a measurement on polycrystalline cu giving @xmath54  fs .",
    "note , preliminary results indicate that transport changes the magnitude of the relaxation time , but not the structure and height of the peak .",
    "the influence of transport will be studied in detail in a separate publication.@xcite in view of the importance of the @xmath0-hole lifetime , it would be highly desirable to perform further experiments as well as theoretical calculations on the @xmath0-hole lifetime in both cu and au .",
