    "the quest for practical implementations of quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite has resulted in a wide variety of proposed quantum computing architectures , based on virtually all kinds of different physical systems @xcite .",
    "thanks to continuous advances in nanoscale design and manufacturing of low - dimensional structures , solid - state platforms promise , in particular , a high level of scalability and large - scale integration . among the various proposals which exist to date , schemes which rely on _ charge _ degrees of freedom of carriers ( _ excitons _ ) confined in a self - assembled semiconductor quantum dot ( qd )",
    "@xcite are especially appealing in view of current ultrafast spectroscopic capabilities , which make it possible to access sub - picosecond gating times by means of suitable all - optical control techniques @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "such advantages are hindered by the rate at which quantum information stored in exciton qubits and/or exciton ancillary states is irreversibly lost due to dephasing  as characterized by a typical time scale @xmath0 .",
    "for qds to be employed in quantum information devices , decoherence processes , which involve energy exchange with the host crystal are highly suppressed due to the large splitting between quantized energy levels .",
    "thus , the dominant contribution to @xmath0 arises from energy - conserving transitions which do not change the occupations of the logical states , but result in _ pure dephasing _ and unrecoverable loss of phase information . while typical @xmath1 times i.e. finite qubit lifetime via exciton recombination , for single qds are in the nanosecond range , it has been shown theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that substantial dephasing can occur in much shorter time scales ( one or two picoseconds at temperatures of a few k ) , mainly due to coupling with acoustic phonons .",
    "borrowing inspiration from coherent averaging techniques in high - resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy @xcite , dynamical decoupling ( dd ) methods have recently emerged in qip as a versatile strategy for counteracting decoherence from non - markovian environments , in a way which is substantially less resource - demanding than traditional quantum error - correcting codes . in its simplest form",
    ", dd is implemented by subjecting the system to periodic sequences of fast and strong ( so - called _ bang - bang _ ) control operations drawn from a basic repertoire , so that interactions whose correlation times are long compared to the control time scale are effectively averaged out to finite accuracy @xcite . in particular , a number of analytical and numerical studies have established the potential for dd schemes based on high - level concatenated @xcite or randomized @xcite design to extend the coherence time of spin degrees of freedom in gate - defined semiconductor qds by ( at least ) two orders of magnitude @xcite . remarkably , simple dd protocols consisting of a single or multiple spin - echoes have been experimentally demonstrated in ( gate - defined ) double qd devices @xcite and rare - earth solid - state centers @xcite , respectively . in this paper",
    "we will consider _ self - assembled _ semiconductor qds .",
    "the usefulness of a suitable burst of ultrashort pulses as a tool to reduce the initial optical polarization dephasing in this type of qd has been demonstrated by axt _",
    "et al _  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the effectiveness of multipulse dd toward both mitigating the initial coherence decay and ensuring enhanced coherence preservation over a desired storage time scale , with emphasis on qip applications .",
    "our analysis has two main implications : first , we show that in spite of being most prone to dephasing , qds which are optimized to support quantum computation are also most efficiently stabilized by dd .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the fact that the exciton spectral density is down - shifted in frequency by the application of a static electric field , dd performance are further improved for a biased qd as required for most computational applications@xcite .",
    "the content of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "iii , we summarize our results on the controlled dephasing dynamics , and characterize the dependence of dd performance upon different system and control parameters  including dot shape , temperature , separation between pulses , and application of an external bias field .",

    "figure [ computpulses ] shows the qubit coherence evolution for both qds in the presence of periodic dd , according to eq .",
    "( [ gam1 ] ) .",
    "the left column corresponds to qd a , and the right to qd b. temperatures are 4k , 77k , and 300k from top to bottom .",
    "it can be seen that for pulses separated by @xmath240  ps , dd approximately freezes the dephasing over the time scales relevant to the problem . for a control sequence with longer pulse delays",
    ", the qubit coherence decays more rapidly , however dephasing can still be strongly suppressed for relatively long times .    in terms of practical quantum computation ,",
    "the bit - flips do not change the time taken for the onset of decoherence , that is , the initial time taken for @xmath241 to sharply decrease from unity .",
    "the qubit follows its free evolution until the first bit - flip occurs , which due to the physical constraint on @xmath190 , happens after some coherence is lost .",
    "still , the pulse sequence succeeds at significantly enhancing the exciton coherence at large @xmath16 . for certain operating temperatures and/or qd devices ,",
    "the resulting coherence level may remain very close to unity , e.g. for qd b at @xmath210k and @xmath242  ps , @xmath243  ps)@xmath244 , to be contrasted with the free evolution value of @xmath245 ( see right upper panel ) . even at room temperature , where for the free evolution all coherence is lost in the first picosecond ,",

    "it is important to note that in the presence of dd , the qubit subject to the applied electric field ( qd b ) dephases _ less _ than without applied field ( compare left and right column of fig .",
    "[ computpulses ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the free evolution behavior , whereby the presence of an electric field increases the coupling to the piezoelectric field and enhances the dephasing .",
    "a static electric field increases the coupling between excitonic qubits and significantly improves the feasibility of quantum computation .",
    "our results demonstrate that an electric field actually _ increases _ the efficiency of periodic dd .",
    "this improvement may be understood by looking at the exciton spectral density .",
    "[ spectcomparison ] compares the spectral density for the exciton with and without electric field .",
    "it can be seen that the spectral density in the presence of an electric field is shifted to _",
    "lower _ frequencies compared to the no field case .",
    "this leads to larger long - term dephasing ( see eq . ( [ gam3 ] ) ) , in a way similar to the increase of dephasing due to the piezoelectric field as @xmath122 increases . introducing the electric field",
    "effectively causes the piezoelectric coupling to contribute more significantly to the dephasing than the deformation potential coupling  @xcite , due to the non - vanishing electron - hole dipole moment . because the relevant spectral density is proportional to the fourier transform of the wave - function , the relative shift of the electron and hole wave - functions results in a narrower spectral density .",
    "in particular , it decreases the spectral density at high frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ spectcomparison ] ) . as a result",
    ", the efficiency of sufficiently fast dd sequences ( @xmath248 ) is increased due to a lower contribution at @xmath196 , as discussed in sec .",
    "more generally , any phenomenon which decreases the spectral density at @xmath196 will automatically improve dd performance .    also note that for very short pulse separations ( @xmath249 ) , coherence is maintained near its value at the instant of the first control pulse . since the applied electric field leads to a slower initial dephasing than the no field case",
    ", less coherence has been lost at the instant of the first control pulse , thus @xmath149 remains at a higher value .",
    "again , this is similar to the piezoelectric dephasing behavior observed for increasing @xmath122 .",
    "effectively , the presence of an electric field or a qd shape such that @xmath122 is close to @xmath134 , @xmath131 leads to greater dephasing , both in terms of the speed of the initial dephasing , as well as the magnitude at which coherence saturates , as seen in sec .",
    "however , our results show that it is precisely for these qds that the dd scheme is most efficient , for the shortest control sequences allowed by the physical system .",
    "specifically , the qds described in this section have @xmath143  nm , which is close to that for which dd is most efficient ( see fig .",
    "[ pulsestdef ] ) . slightly changing the dot dimensions",
    "so that @xmath122 becomes closer to the ideal value would further improve the results reported in fig .",
    "[ computpulses ] .",
    "our calculations indicate that dd may effectively decouple the exciton qubit from the environment for a long time , allowing robust storage of quantum information . in standard solid - state quantum computation schemes , holes in double dots @xcite and spin qubits",
    "@xcite are employed for long - term quantum information storage , due to longer @xmath1 lifetimes , whilst exciton qubits are usually proposed for computation only , often as ancillary states , and used for gating purposes .",
    "however , quantum algorithms are generally built up of a series of gates , and _ arbitrary _ qubit states may have to be stored _",
    "temporarily _ while other gate operations are carried out .",
    "we propose that dd be invoked to achieve robust _ short - term storage_.    as a concrete example , consider the toffoli gate@xcite given in fig .",
    "[ toffoli ] .",
    "while this is a very simple three - qubit operation , it still requires the first control qubit to be stored for the time taken to perform 8 gate operations .",
    "if we consider an average gating time of @xmath250 ps per gate , fig .",
    "[ rhonat ] shows that unless techniques like the one we propose are used , substantial decoherence would occur on these timescales .",

    "we have shown that the dephasing of an exciton qubit due to its coupling with the lattice phonons can be significantly decreased by coherent dynamical control .",
    "we found that whilst quantum dots with a size and shape most suitable for quantum computation are the most prone to dephasing , periodic dynamical decoupling is most efficient for exactly this type of dot .",
    "we have demonstrated that a good estimate for the shape of the dot which optimizes decoupling performance is the one where the hole wavefunction is spherical .",
    "in addition , our analysis indicates that , although the presence of an electric field ( which is required by most exciton - based quantum computing schemes ) increases dephasing , it also makes for improved decoupling performance . in the presence of periodic decoupling",
    ", the decay of qubit coherence is substantially reduced over evolution times which are very long compared to typical gating times . under favorable circumstances , it is reduced so significantly that in practical terms the qubit no longer dephases . we propose that dynamical decoupling in the simplest periodic implementation examined here may be useful to improve temporary data storage during the memory stage of quantum computation .    besides assessing the impact of pulse imperfections which are unavoidably present in real control systems , several extensions of the present analysis may be worth considering . in particular , dynamical decoupling schemes which involve non - uniform time delays and are based on either recursive concatenated design @xcite or direct cancellation of high - order error terms @xcite have been recently found to attain remarkable high decoupling fidelity under appropriate assumptions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , so - called eulerian decoupling schemes @xcite allow decoherence suppression to be achieved without requiring unrealistic control strengths as in the bang - bang limit  which may be critical to minimize unwanted excitations .",
    "a future investigation will be needed to identify the possible added benefits of more elaborated decoupling schemes under the specific physical constraints and design trade - offs associated with exciton based quantum - dot devices .",
