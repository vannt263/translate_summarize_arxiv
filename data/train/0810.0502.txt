    "within the standard model  violation arises from a single irreducible complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - flavor - mixing matrix @xmath3and manifests itself as a non - zero area of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) .",
    "this triangle depicts , in the complex plane , the relation @xmath4 , that follows from the unitarity of @xmath3 . the  experiment has measured precisely , in @xmath5 decays , the angle @xmath6 of the ut , finding a value that differs significantly from 0 and @xmath7 .",
    "this clearly indicates that the area of the ut is non - vanishing , thus establishing -violation . in order to confirm that the ckm mechanism is the correct explanation for -violation , we need to overconstrain the ut by measuring precisely the other angles ( @xmath8 and @xmath0 ) and the sides .",
    "the angle @xmath9 can be measured in a theoretically clean way in -violating @xmath2 meson decays to open - charm final states , @xmath10 . in these",
    "decays the interference between the tree amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 leads to observables that depend on the relative weak phase @xmath0 , the magnitude ratio @xmath13 and the relative strong phase @xmath14 between the two amplitudes . @xmath15 and @xmath14",
    "depend on the @xmath2 decay under investigation ; they are difficult to estimate precisely from theory ( qcd ) , but can be extracted directly from data together with @xmath0 .    in order to search for the interference between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 tree amplitudes , we have reconstructed the following decays , which lead to final states that can be produced both through @xmath16 and @xmath17 mediated processes : ( i ) charged @xmath18 and @xmath19 decays and neutral @xmath20 decays , followed by @xmath21 meson decays to final states accessible also to @xmath22 ; ( ii ) neutral @xmath23 decays to @xmath24 . in the latter case",
    ", interference between the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 mediated processes is achieved through @xmath27 mixing .",
    "the measurements presented here exploit , partially or in total , the large data sample ( @xmath28 @xmath29 pairs , assumed to be equally divided into @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) accumulated by  in the years 1999 - 2007 .",
    "yet , they are still statistically limited , as the effects that are being searched for are tiny :    * the branching fractions of the @xmath2 meson decays considered here are on the order of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) or @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . branching fractions for @xmath21 decays , including secondary decays , range between @xmath38 and @xmath39 ;",

    "the interference between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 mediated @xmath2 decay amplitudes is predicted to be low , as the ratio @xmath15 is expected to be around 40% for neutral @xmath43 and @xmath35 ( due to ckm factors ) and around 10% for charged @xmath44 decays ( due to ckm factors and the additional color - suppression of @xmath45 ) .",
    "the final states of these @xmath2 meson decays are completely reconstructed , with efficiencies that range between 40% ( for low - multiplicity , low - background decay modes ) and 5% ( for high - multiplicity decays ) .",
