    "the azimuthal anisotropy of hadron transverse momentum distributions in heavy ion collisions at rhic is sensitive to the properties of produced matter . in the framework of transport approach ,",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite using the zpc model @xcite that the value of the second harmonic , i.e. , the elliptic flow , depends sensitively on the magnitude of parton scattering cross sections . with a more realistic collision dynamics via the ampt model @xcite",
    ", it was further shown that the observed large elliptic flow and its ordering according to hadron masses @xcite as well as high - order anisotropic flows @xcite could be explained if partons scatter with cross sections much larger than those given by the perturbative qcd . including also charm quarks in the ampt model @xcite ,",
    "the observed large elliptic flow of electrons from the decay of charmed mesons is again consistent with a large charm scattering cross section . in the present contribution ,",
    "recent results from the ampt model on the rapidity and collision system dependence of anisotropic flows are presented @xcite .",
    "the ampt model is a hybrid model that uses minijet partons from hard processes and strings from soft processes in the hijing model @xcite as the initial conditions for modelling heavy ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies . in the default version , time evolution of resulting minijet partons",
    "is described by the zpc model @xcite with an in - medium cross section derived from the lowest - order born diagram with an effective gluon screening mass taken as a parameter for fixing the magnitude and angular distribution of parton scattering cross section .",
    "after minijet partons stop interacting , they are combined with their parent strings , as in the hijing model with jet quenching , to fragment into hadrons using the lund string fragmentation model as implemented in the pythia program @xcite .",
    "the final - state hadronic scatterings are then modelled by the art model @xcite . in an extended string melting version of the ampt model @xcite , hadrons that would have been produced from string fragmentation",
    "are converted to valence quarks and/or antiquarks in order to model the initially formed partonic matter .",
    "interactions among these partons are again described by the zpc parton cascade model .",
    "the transition from the partonic matter to the hadronic matter is achieved using a simple coalescence model , which combines two nearest quark and antiquark into mesons and three nearest quarks or antiquarks into baryons or anti - baryons that are close to the invariant mass of these partons .",

    "results from the ampt model on the pseudorapidity ( @xmath2 ) dependence of the directed ( @xmath3 ) and elliptic ( @xmath0 ) flows of charged hadrons in minimum bias events of au + au collisions at @xmath1 agev are shown , respectively , in the left and right panels of fig .",

    "the version with string melting can reproduce approximately the star data ( solid circles ) @xcite around the mid - pseudorapidity region , while only the default version can describe the data at large @xmath5 . for @xmath0 , the string melting scenario with a parton scattering cross section of @xmath6 @xmath7 mb",

    "these interesting features may imply that initially the matter produced at large pseudorapidity is dominated by strings while that produced around mid - rapidity mainly consists of partons .",

    "this is consistent with the linear scaling of the system size as well as the combined effect of the initial energy density and spatial eccentricity .",

    ", we find that charged hadrons produced around mid - rapidity in asymmetric cu+au collisions display a stronger @xmath4 and their @xmath0 is also more sensitive to the parton cross section used in the parton cascade .",
    "furthermore , both @xmath3 and @xmath13 are appreciable and show an asymmetry in the forward and backward rapidities .",
    "using the model , we have studied the rapidity and colliding system size dependence of anisotropic flows in heavy ion collisions at .",
    "we find that results on the rapidity dependence of anisotropic flows suggest that a partonic matter is formed during early stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions only around mid - rapidity and that strings remain dominant at large rapidities . furthermore , to reproduce the experimental data requires a parton cross section that is larger than that given by the perturbative qcd , indicating that nonperterbative effects are important in the produced partonic matter at rhic .",
    "also , a linear scaling with the colliding system size is observed for the elliptic flow of charged hadrons in minimum bias collisions . for collisions of asymmetric systems , there is a strong @xmath4 around mid - rapidity , and both @xmath4 and @xmath0 are asymmetric in the forward and backward rapidities .",
