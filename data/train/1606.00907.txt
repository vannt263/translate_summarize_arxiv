    "replica 1 is the original system .",
    "the higher replicas have larger @xmath182 , which we take to be @xmath183 . if @xmath184 is the dimension of the space replica @xmath169 lives in , then @xmath185 .",
    "larger time step has two consequences .",
    "one is that an mcmc step is cheaper .",
    "the other is that there is less dynamic range in the fluctuations .",
