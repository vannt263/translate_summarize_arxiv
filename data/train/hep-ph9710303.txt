    "one of the main physics goals of lep2 and future @xmath3 colliders is to directly test the gauge nature of couplings among the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "deviations from the standard model ( sm ) predictions for these couplings would indicate the existence of new physics effects .",
    "the most general phenomenological parametrization for these deviations can be achieved by means of an effective lagrangian @xcite that involves , apart from the sm lagrangian , high  dimension operators that describe the new phenomena , containing the relevant fields at low energies and respecting the symmetries of the standard model .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach is a model  independent way to describe new physics that can occur at an energy scale @xmath4 much larger than the scale where the experiments are performed @xcite .",
    "here we focus on a linearly realized @xmath5 invariant effective lagrangian to describe the bosonic sector of the standard model , keeping the fermionic couplings unchanged . in order to write down the most general dimension6 effective lagrangian containing all sm bosonic fields , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , we adopt the notation of hagiwara _ et al .",
    "this lagrangian has eleven independent operators in the linear representation that are locally @xmath10 invariant , @xmath11 and @xmath12 even .",
    "we discard the four operators which affect the gauge boson two  point functions at tree  level and therefore are strongly constrained by lep1 measurements .",
    "we also do not consider the two operators that modify only the higgs boson self ",
    "interactions , since they are not relevant for our calculations .",
    "we are then left with five independent operators , and the lagrangian is written as , @xmath13 with each operator @xmath14 defined as in ref .",
    "it is important to notice that this effective lagrangian , often used to describe anomalous trilinear gauge couplings , can lead to anomalous quartic interaction among gauge bosons and also to anomalous couplings of these particles with the higgs field .",
    "the operator @xmath15 contributes only to anomalous gauge boson self couplings ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 contribute only to anomalous higgs couplings ( @xmath20 ) , whereas @xmath21 and @xmath22 give rise to both kinds of new couplings .",
    "all these interactions should be investigated at the nlc in order to search for hints about the nature of the new physics described by these higher dimensional operators .    in this contribution",
    "we present the results of our analyses constraining the coefficients of the dimension6 effective lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) via the processes @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 @xcite at the next linear collider ( nlc ) .",
    "some related works include the references @xcite .",
    "we chose to study the reaction @xmath0 since it is the process with the largest cross section involving triple , quartic gauge boson couplings and also anomalous higgs  gauge boson couplings .",
    "therefore , it is also sensitive to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , offering an excellent possibility for a detailed study of these couplings .",
    "it is important to notice that studies of anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings from @xmath28pair production will significantly constrain combinations of the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "however , they are  blind \" with respect to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "another way to test the anomalous higgs couplings generated by the operators @xmath18 and @xmath32 is through the analysis of the processes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , that are only sensitive to @xmath35 and @xmath36 anomalous higgs interactions which , in the sm , appear only at one  loop level @xcite .",
    "the standard model cross section for the process @xmath23 was evaluated in ref .  @xcite . including the new contributions from ( [ lagrangian ] ) , there are 16 standard and 26 anomalous feynman diagrams involved in the reaction @xmath38 @xcite . in order to compute these contributions ,",
    "we have incorporated all new couplings in a helas ",
    "type @xcite fortran subroutines .",
    "these new subroutines were used to extend a madgraph @xcite generated code to include all the anomalous contributions and to numerically evaluate the helicity amplitudes and the squared matrix element .",
    "we have checked that our code passed the non  trivial test of electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "we employed vegas @xcite to perform the monte carlo phase space integration with the appropriate cuts to obtain the differential and total cross sections .",
    "our results were obtained assuming @xmath39 and an integrated luminosity @xmath40 .",
    "we adopted a cut in the photon energy of @xmath41 and required the angle between any two particles to be larger than @xmath42 . in these conditions , @xmath43 fb and",
    "we can expect around @xmath44 events per year .",
    "as we could expect , the @xmath28pair production at nlc is able to put a limit that is one order of magnitude better for the coefficients @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "however this reaction is _ not _ able to constraint @xmath46 .",
    "this can be accomplished using the reaction @xmath0 , which gives rise to bounds on the values of these coefficients .    0.8 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.5 cm _ table ii",
    ". range of the allowed values of the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath26 , in tev@xmath47 , for a @xmath48 deviation in the total cross section of the process @xmath49 at nlc .",
    "_    we tried to take advantage of the fact that the new interactions affect mostly the longitudinally polarized gauge bosons by studying the polarized @xmath50 production . unfortunately the improvement obtained is very small since this requirement reduces by two orders of magnitude the total yield .",
    "we have also investigated different distributions of the final state particles in order to search for kinematical cuts that could improve the nlc sensitivity .",
    "the most promising variable is again the photon transverse momentum .",
    "similarly to the @xmath37 production , the contribution of the anomalous couplings is larger in the high @xmath51 region , and a cut of @xmath52 gev is able to reduce in a significant way the background . the improvement on @xmath53 bounds can be clearly seen from fig .  1 ( c ) and 1 ( d ) where the deviations in the total cross section , for @xmath54 gev , are shown before and after the above cut is applied .    the limits for @xmath27 and @xmath26 obtained from the study of the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath49 , presented in tables i and ii , are comparable and both processes can be used as complementary tool in the study of anomalous higgs interactions .",
    "the search for the effect of higher dimensional operators that give rise to anomalous bosonic couplings may provide important information on physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we have analysed the contributions of anomalous couplings arising from dimension6 operators of a linearly realized @xmath55 invariant effective lagrangian in the processes @xmath56 , @xmath33 , and @xmath57 .",
    "we have included in our calculations , _ all _ the anomalous trilinear and quartic gauge couplings , the anomalous higgs couplings with gauge bosons and we have taken into account the standard model irreducible background .",
    "the impact of the anomalous contributions in the total cross section of these processes were analysed at the nlc .",
    "polarization of the final state bosons are found to be insufficient to improve the limits obtained from the total cross section of the three processes .",
    "we mainly focused on the operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which can not be tested in the @xmath58pair production process .",
    "we showed that a photon transverse momentum cut , @xmath59 gev , can improve the limits on @xmath26 and @xmath27 obtained through an analysis of the total cross section .",
    "typical sensitivities of a few tev@xmath47 are obtained at the nlc for these coefficients .",
