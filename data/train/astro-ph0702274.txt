    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are generally defined as extra - nuclear galactic x - ray sources with x - ray luminosities @xmath4  erg s@xmath1 , a luminosity that is seldom reached by any galactic ( milky way ) x - ray binary ( xrb ) .",
    "if ulxs emit their x - rays isotropically , by eddington arguments , the central object could be a black hole ( bh ) with mass m @xmath5 5  m@xmath6 , and for eddington ratios of @xmath710@xmath8@xmath910@xmath1 , the implied mass of the central object is @xmath750@xmath9500  m@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , some ulxs could be accreting intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the majority of ulxs , however , are likely accreting _ stellar _ mass black holes ( e.g. , @xmath1010",
    "m@xmath6 ) as there appears to be a strong association between ulx sources and star formation in galaxies @xcite .",
    "one popular model claims that ulxs are merely stellar - mass bhs in high - mass xrbs , and mild beaming of their x - ray luminosities produces the observational illusion of extremely high x - ray luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hundreds of ulxs are known at the present time ( e.g. , roberts & warwick 2000 , colbert & ptak 2002 , and chandra ulx catalogs by ptak et al .",
    ", swartz et al . 2004 , and liu & bregman 2005 ) .",
    "accreting binaries such as these could be precursors to eventual gravitational radiation events .",
    "further , ulxs are important as they often dominate the total observed x - ray flux in starburst galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "their relationship with star formation also appears to extend to cosmologically interesting ( @xmath11 ) look - back times @xcite and may provide a cosmological tool .",
    "unfortunately , all but the very brightest ulx sources are too faint for detailed x - ray spectroscopy studies ( the best cases must rely upon resolving power of r@xmath12 at 6.4  kev , available with x - ray ccds ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is perhaps hope for ascertaining the nature of ulx sources by studying their interactions with their surroundings , such as gas , dust and stars ; such information may be captured using infrared spectral diagnostics . @xcite were the first to show that ionization - sensitive indices based on mid - infrared ratios were helpful for identifying the nature of heavily obscured nuclear sources @xcite .",
    "we have thus taken advantage of the resolving power ( r  @xmath13 ) of the _ infrared spectrograph _ ( irs ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( sst ) to calculate highly accurate ionization diagnostic ratios .",
    "the nearby galaxy pair ngc  4485/90 provides an excellent opportunity for studying ulx sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "there are six ulxs in ngc  4485/90 ( d @xmath14 7.8  mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , far more than is typical ( @xmath15 2 in most cases , and 0.2 , on average ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution afforded by the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope s infrared spectrograph ( irs ) coupled with the proximity of ngc  4485/90 allow us to carry out this important experiment .",
    "we have performed spectral mapping of the system ngc  4485/90 by using the mapping mode of the irs @xcite on board the sst .",
    "rectangular regions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( i.e. zones of @xmath18  kpc and @xmath19  kpc at the system ) were mapped using both the short - high ( sh , @xmath20  @xmath3 m ) and long - high ( lh , @xmath21  @xmath3 m ) slits , respectively . six rectangular regions centered at the positions of the ulxs ( table  [ tbl-1 ] )",
    "were covered using a @xmath22 and @xmath23 grid array for the long and and short slits of the irs .",
    "in addition two positions in ngc  4490 that are _ not _ near ulxs were observed with the same configuration as the one used for the ulxs .",
    "the integration time was 240  s at each position , and the step size is half the slit width perpendicular to the slit .",
    "this configuration allows net exposures of @xmath24  s for rectangular sizes @xmath25  and @xmath26  for long and short high slits , respectively",
    ".    sets of 8 exposures were taken for each position with the irs .",
    "the pre - reduced basic calibrated data ( _ bcd _ ) files were obtained from the _ spitzer science center _ ( ssc ) data base . in order to extract the spectra for the sh and lh modes",
    ", we used smart ( spectroscopy modeling analysis and reduction , * ? ? ? * ) which is publicly available software provided by the ssc .",
    "we have used line identifications from @xcite , @xcite and nist @xcite .",
    "we have combined both modes by re - scaling the lh mode spectra to the sh mode spectra by adding or subtracting a constant and then re - binning to a resolution of 0.0287  @xmath3m / pixel . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the combined spectra from all the positions .    as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , some of the line features are present or stronger in the ulx region than in the comparison region spectra .",
    "the most striking examples are features such as [ s  iv]10.51 , [ ne  ii]12.81 , [ na  i]14.6 , [ ne  iii]15.55 , [ s  iii]18.71 , and [ s  iii]33.48  @xmath3 m that seem to be significantly stronger in the comparison regions and ulx-1(which is thought to be a snr rather than an accreting binary ) , than in the rest of the sources . in the opposite way , the [ si  ii]34.82  @xmath3 m line is stronger in ulx-2 to ulx-6 .    the purpose of this work is to generate some emission line diagnostic diagrams similar to commonly used optical emission line diagrams , which have proven useful in separating accretion - dominated sources from those dominated by stellar sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a popular mid - infrared diagnostic first put forth in an iso spectroscopic survey of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) by @xcite , and later explored by @xcite , plots the emission line ratio [ o  iv]25.91 @xmath3 m @xmath27 [ ne  ii]12.81 @xmath3 m versus the strength of a mid - infrared _ poly aromatic hydrocarbons _ ( pah ) features .",
    "these two lines however , are relatively weak and difficult to detect in lower luminosity systems . taking advantage of the strong low ionization line emission of [ si  ii]34.82 @xmath3 m , @xcite suggested alternative diagrams to distinguish agns from sf regions such as [ ne  iii]15.55@xmath3m@xmath27[ne  ii]12.81@xmath3 m and [ s  iii]33.48@xmath3m@xmath27[si  ii]34.82@xmath3 m .",
    "these ratios proved to be successful in separating accretion - powered vs. sf powered regions in the sings galaxy sample .",
    "we have calculated these ratios for our eight spectra , shown in fig .",
    "we have also plotted the data from @xcite that include nuclear and extra - nuclear regions from sings , the smc / lmc and galactic h  ii regions .",
    "errors in the emission line fluxes calculation are around 10% . the boundaries in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are defined with the same curves as in @xcite . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , ulx-2 , ulx-3 , ulx-4 , ulx-5 , and ulx-6 are in zone i where seyfert and liners are observed , while ulx-1 , comp - nw , and comp - cent are located in zone iii as star forming systems . for ulx-2 and ulx-6 the line ratio [ s iii]33.48  @xmath3m@xmath27[si  ii]34.82  @xmath3",
    "m is @xmath28 , which is extremely low compared with extragalactic objects in fig .",
    "the sings group has recently developed models ( _ pahfit _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to characterize pah features .",
    "the models include starlight continuum , featureless thermal dust continuum , pure rotational lines of h@xmath29 , fine - structure lines , dust emission features , and dust extinction .",
    "the starlight continuum is represented by a blackbody emission was fixed at @xmath30 k. nine thermal dust continuum components are represented by blackbodies at fixed temperatures @xmath31 k. the program _",
    "pahfit _ performs a fit through two hundred iterations , each iteration determines a @xmath32 value for all nine temperatures , until a minimum value for @xmath32 is found .",
    "dust temperatures are based on the shape of the continuum spectrum .",
    "we show the corresponding fits in table  [ tbl-1 ] , where we show ulx-2 and ulx-6 have hotter components , but the relative intensity of those components is low for ulx-1 .    the presence of a hotter dust component will flatten the spectra for our range of wavelengths .",
    "this effect is seen in fig  [ fig1 ] for ulx-2 and ulx-6.the rest of the parameters modeled will be subject of a forthcoming paper ( vzquez , et al . 2007b , _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "finally , we have found a strong linear anti - correlation between the observed @xmath33 and @xmath34([s  iii]33.48  @xmath3m@xmath27[si  ii]34.82  @xmath3 m ) .",
    "the regression and intercept coefficients are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively with a rms = 0.08 .",
    "for the first time the ir continuum and lines ( @xmath37  @xmath3 m ) have been observed in ulxs by using the power of the _ spitzer _ irs .",
    "it is likely that this ulxs are irradiating nearby star - forming clouds .",
    "although the geometry is probably thus quite complex , we do find some hints of information on the underlaying x - ray radiation .",
    "the most striking result from the data analyzed in this work is the one in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which shows that five of the six ulxs reported by @xcite fall in the `` agn zone '' determined by the infrared diagnostic emission line ratios defined by the emission lines of ne , s , and si @xcite .",
    "both of the comparison regions used here , which do not harbor ulx sources , fall in the zone of sf .",
    "the sf zone is also occupied by extra - nuclear star - forming regions in the sings galaxy sample and smc / lmc and galactic h  ii regions",
    ". the emission line at [ n  i]10.33 and other unidentified features also behave like [ si  ii]34.82  @xmath3 m , showing a stronger contribution in ulx-2 to 6 than in ulx-1 and both of the comparison regions .",
    "the presence of a hotter dust component in our pah / continuum modeling ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) , suggests that at least for ulx-2 and ulx-6 the [ si  ii ] lines could be originating from an accreting source .",
    "a dilution factor could be affecting the rest of the ulxs possibly due to their location within their host galaxy . all of this is consistent with the anti - correlation we have found between the line emission ratio of [ s  iii]33.48@xmath3m@xmath27[si  ii]34.82@xmath3 m and the observed x - ray luminosity of the six ulxs , the more luminous the sources the lower the ratio of these emission lines .",
    "different scenarios for the strong [ si  ii ] line have been suggested in the literature . in these scenarios",
    "the increasing density in h  ii , photo - dissociation ( pdr ) , and x - ray dissociation regions ( xdr ) , respectively , increases the intensity of the [ si  ii]34.82  @xmath3 m line ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a third scenario suggests that heavy elements such as si , mg , and fe may be returned to the gas phase by dust destruction ( e.g. , sputtering ) in regions subject to strong shocks caused by stellar winds , starbursts , and agn activity @xcite .",
    "details of the geometry and ionization balance in the region require more detailed fitting , and also spatial mapping of spectral parameters as ulxs are thought to have drifted from their birthplaces .",
    "the origin of these lines could thus be disentangled with detailed irs mapping observations and irac imaging , which are the subject of a forthcoming paper ( vzquez et al .",
    "2007b ) .    with the exception of a weak detection in ulx-1",
    ", we have not detected the emission line [ o  iv]25.91  @xmath3 m , this line is a strong feature in snr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supporting previous suggestions that ulx-1 is a snr ( e.g. , based on radio and x - ray constraints ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mid - infrared emission line diagnostics used to uncover the nature of agns and sf galaxies has been shown here to work well separating sfrs and young sn from probably true accreting ulxs ( according to x - ray observations ; * ? ? ?",
    "but this is a small sample of ulxs to claim a general rule that could be improved observing a higher number of ulxs .",
    "the present work shows that a new diagnostic window has been opened on ulxs and their immediate environment via important mid - infrared features like [ si  ii]34.82 @xmath3 m , made observationally available by the extraordinary performance of the irs on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope .      armus , l. , et al .",
