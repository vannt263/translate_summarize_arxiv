    "the layered cobalt oxides na@xmath1coo@xmath2 have attracted much attention in recent years , because of a rich variety of orders competing for the ground state . for @xmath4=0.75",
    ", the material shows a large thermoelectric power @xcite , while the @xmath4=0.5 compound is a charge ordered insulator with @xmath13=50 k @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties are different for different na contents @xcite . at the side with @xmath4",
    "larger than 0.5 , the dc susceptibility shows a curie - weiss temperature ( @xmath14 ) variation , while at the low- @xmath4 side the susceptibility is @xmath14-independent @xcite .",
    "most interestingly , superconductivity with @xmath154.5 k emerges around @xmath4=0.3 when water molecules are intercalated in between the co layers @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that @xmath6 can be tuned by varying @xmath4 in the range of @xmath160.38 @xcite .",
    "one of the unsettled issues on the superconductivity is the symmetry of the gap function .",
    "theoretically , a chiral(@xmath17 ) superconducting state was first proposed on the basis of rvb scenario @xcite . in a previous study , we found that the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath9 shows no coherence peak below @xmath6 , and follows a @xmath18 variation with @xmath19= 2.2@xmath51 at low @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the superconductivity is of non - bcs type , but it has been pointed out that the data are insufficient to distinguish between some exotic states @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that both chiral and pure @xmath20-wave states in the presence of disorder @xcite , or an odd - frequency @xmath21-wave state @xcite can be compatible with such @xmath14-variation of @xmath22 .",
    "since identification of the gap function is the first step toward the understanding of the superconductivity , more work is needed .",
    "another issue is how the electron correlations in the normal state evolve with doping , which should help understanding the mechanism for the superconductivity . in the octahedral crystal electric field environment , two @xmath23 orbitals of co",
    "are located much higher in energy above @xmath24 orbitals .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda ) band calculation shows that @xcite , among the three @xmath24 orbitals , the @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27-axis is the threefold rotation axis ) orbit lies higher in energy than the remaining two @xmath28 orbitals .",
    "if one takes this picture @xcite , then the co@xmath29 state without na has one electron in the @xmath25 orbital ( spin 1/2 ) , with the @xmath28 orbitals fully occupied .",
    "this single - orbital situation resembles the undoped cuprates ; adding na dopes electrons into the @xmath25 orbital .",
    "in contrast , multiple - band models were also proposed @xcite , which draw similarities to the manganese oxides , another important class of strongly correlated materials .    in this letter",
    ", we address the above two issues by studying the evolution of the system with doping using nqr ( nuclear quadrupole resonance ) technique .",
    "we present intensive data on the superconducting and the normal states over a wide range of na content .",
    "the na@xmath30coo@xmath31@xmath32yh@xmath31o powder @xcite was synthesized following ref .",
    "the precursor of na@xmath33coo@xmath2 was immersed in the br@xmath31/ch@xmath34cn solution to de - intercalate na .",
    "the amount of br@xmath31 is listed in table 1 , where x means the theoretical value necessary to remove all the na .",
    "the na content of the final product was determined by the ion coupled plasma method .",
    "x - ray diffraction indicates that the samples are single phase except the 5x ( @xmath350.34 ) and 10x ( @xmath350.32 ) samples in which minor secondary phases are present .",
    "the c - axis elongates as the na content decreases , in agreement with previous report @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 was determined from the ac susceptibility and the @xmath9 measurements .",
    "the previously reported sample @xcite was made with 10x br amount in a separate run and turned out to have an @xmath350.31 .",
    "all other samples were made in the same run .",
    "@xmath0co nqr measurements were carried out by using a phase - coherent spectrometer .",
    "the nuclear magnetization decay curve is excellently fitted to the theoretical curves @xcite , with a unique @xmath22 component .",
    "@*7l    br amount & na content @xmath4 & c - axis length (  ) & a - axis length (  ) & @xmath6 ( k ) + 5x & 0.34 & 19.50 & 2.822 & 2.65 + 10x & 0.32 & 19.62 & 2.822 & 3.60 + 10x @xcite & 0.31 & 19.59 & 2.819 & 3.70 + 20x & 0.28 & 19.73 & 2.817 & 4.75 + 40x & 0.25 & 19.80 & 2.817 & 4.70 + 100x & 0.26 & 19.79 & 2.815 & 4.60 +    figure 1(a ) shows a typical example of the three nqr transition lines arising from the nuclear spin @xmath36=7/2 of @xmath0co .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the @xmath37 3/2@xmath38@xmath375/2 transition line for various na contents .",
    "firstly , the peak frequency increases as @xmath4 decreases down to @xmath4=0.28 .",
    "analysis of three transition lines allows us to find that the @xmath39 increases as the na content decreases down to @xmath4=0.28 , but the asymmetry parameter @xmath40 decreases monotonically with decreasing na content , as seen in fig .",
    "1(c ) and ( d ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath40 are defined as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being the nuclear quadrupole moment and @xmath45 being the electric field gradient at the position of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the decrease of @xmath39 with increasing @xmath4 is consistent with doping electrons into the @xmath25 orbit @xcite .",
    "secondly , for the 5x ( @xmath350.34 ) and 10x ( @xmath350.32 ) samples , there appear multiple peaks for the transition",
    ". however , the additional peaks with smaller amplitude are not due to the minor impurity phase detected in the x - ray chart .",
    "rather , we find that @xmath9 measured in different peaks differs only by 10% in magnitude and shows the identical temperature variation ; a clear decreases was seen below @xmath6 .",
    "these peaks may have arisen from the ordering of na ions @xcite which are located above and below co. more detailed discussion will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that the multiple peaks seen in the @xmath37 3/2@xmath38@xmath375/2 transition are not resolvable in the @xmath37 5/2@xmath38@xmath377/2 transition .",
    "figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the quantity @xmath46 for various @xmath4 .",
    "all measurements were done at the @xmath37 3/2@xmath38@xmath375/2 transition . for the 5x and 10x samples ,",
    "@xmath9 was measured at the main peak shown in fig .",
    "two trends can be seen in fig .",
    "2 . first , the absolute value increases with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "second , @xmath46 increases upon lowering @xmath14 , indicating the importance of spin correlations ; the smaller the @xmath4 the steeper the increase , indicating that the spin correlations become stronger as @xmath4 is reduced .",
    "what is the nature of the spin correlations ?",
    "one good way to tell is through inspection of the knight shift , which measures the spin susceptibility and , unlike the bulk susceptibility , is not affected by the presence of magnetic impurities . in a superconducting single crystal with @xmath350.3 , we found that the shift is @xmath14-invariant from @xmath6 up to @xmath14=120 k @xcite , which is in good agreement with the report of ning _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "these results rule out the possibility of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations with wave vector @xmath47=0 , since in that case the knight shift would follow the temperature dependence of @xmath46 because both of them would be dominated by the susceptibility at wave vector @xmath48 0 .    the results thus indicate that the spin fluctuations peak at finite wave vector .",
    "the most likely candidate is antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations @xcite , although its detailed @xmath47-dependence awaits clarification by future experiments , in particular neutron scattering .",
    "below we analyze our data in terms of af correlations , in an attempt to quantify the discussion . in a general form , @xmath46",
    "is written as @xmath49 in the @xmath500 limit , where @xmath51 is the hyperfine coupling constant , and @xmath52 is the imaginary part of the @xmath47-dependent , dynamical susceptibility .",
    "if one assumes that there is a peak around the af wave vector @xmath44 , then one may have the following approximation : @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 denotes the contribution from wave vectors other than @xmath44 , which usually is dominated by the uniform susceptibility @xmath55 . for the af contribution",
    ", we use the formula for a two - dimensional nearly antiferromagnet , namely , ( @xmath56 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we find that such model fits the data quite successfully , as depicted by the curves in fig .",
    "the resulting fitting parameters are shown in figure 3 .",
    "note that a small value of @xmath57 means that a system is close to the af instability ( @xmath57=0 ) .",
    "the enhancement of the spin correlation ( decrease of @xmath57 ) with decreasing @xmath4 , as is the case in doped copper oxide high-@xmath6 superconductors , can be naturally understood in the single - orbital picture @xcite described earlier .",
    "in contrast , the multiple - band theory predicts na content - insensitive , ferromagnetic spin correlations @xcite .    turning to the quantity @xmath54 , its increase with decreasing @xmath4 can be attributed to the increase of density of state ( dos ) at the fermi level .",
    "this result is consistent with the lda band calculation which found that the dominant fermi surface is a _ hole - like _ one and that the dos increases as the electron number is reduced @xcite .",
    "this aspect is different from the case of doped cuprates where the dos decreases as decreasing carrier density .",
    "we summarize our results in fig .",
    "as @xmath4 decreases from 0.34 , @xmath6 increases , but reaches to a plateau of @xmath54.7 k for @xmath580.28 .",
    "our results for high value of @xmath4 are in good agreement with the report by schaak _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "a plateau has also been reported recently by chen _",
    "et al _ and milne _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that as the parameter @xmath57 decreases and @xmath59 increases , namely , as the electron correlation becomes stronger , @xmath6 increases .",
    "next , we turn to the superconducting state . as can be seen already in fig .",
    "2 , no coherence peak was seen just below @xmath6 in all samples , irrespective of na content and/or @xmath6 value",
    ". however , the low-@xmath14 behavior is sample dependent .",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "4 the results for the sample with @xmath80.26 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath9 follows a @xmath10 variation down to the lowest temperature measured ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this result indicates unambiguously that there exists line - nodes in the gap function .",
    "as we noted in previous publications @xcite , the gap function with line nodes generates an energy ( @xmath61)-linear dos at low @xmath61 which results in a @xmath18 ( @xmath19=3 ) dependence of @xmath9 . in the previous sample , @xmath9 did not follow an exact @xmath10 variation and became proportional to @xmath14 below @xmath62 , @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that many exotic superconducting states can be compatible with the data @xcite .",
    "calculations incorporating impurity / disorder scattering showed that a @xmath63+i@xmath64 state which has a full gap is more consistent with the previous data @xcite .",
    "our present result completely rules out the @xmath63+i@xmath64 state proposed by the @xmath65 model in an isotropic triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "also , the odd frequency state proposed @xcite is gapless @xcite , and is incompatible with our finding in the @xmath4=0.26 sample .",
    "however , if anisotropy of the @xmath66 term is incorporated , the theories could be compatible with our experimental results .",
    "in fact , it has been recently shown that a small anisotropy in @xmath66 ( 10@xmath520% ) lifts the degeneracy between @xmath63 and @xmath64 states , leading to a stabilization of a pure @xmath20-wave state @xcite .",
    "in other samples with either larger or smaller @xmath4 , however , @xmath9 deviates from the @xmath10 relation below @xmath14=2.0 k. to see this more clearly , we plot the @xmath14-dependence of @xmath9 for all samples in fig .",
    "5 . in the inset of the figure",
    "is shown the normalized @xmath9 by its value at @xmath67 against the reduced temperature . what is responsible for the deviation from the @xmath10 variation in samples with @xmath4 either larger or smaller than 0.26 ?",
    "disorder or impurity is an unlikely candidate , since the samples with @xmath350.28 and @xmath350.25 have very similar or even higher @xmath6 and nqr line - width as the @xmath8 0.26 sample .",
    "clearly , this unprecedented property deserves further investigation , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "meanwhile , low - lying excitations due to nearby competing orders may be a possible candidate . for larger @xmath4 ,",
    "it is known that charge ordering @xcite occurs",
    ". the na order could also give rise to the anisotropy of the hopping integral @xmath66 mentioned earlier .",
    "for smaller @xmath4 , on the other hand , it has been proposed that different charge / magnetic order may occur at @xmath4=1/4 @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented intensive @xmath0co- nqr measurements on the cobalt oxide superconductors na@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath2o over a wide na content range @xmath4=0.25@xmath5 0.34 .",
    "we find that @xmath6 increases with decreasing @xmath4 but reaches to a plateau for @xmath70.28 . in the superconducting state ,",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath9 shows a @xmath10 variation down to @xmath11 for @xmath80.26 , which indicates unambiguously the presence of line nodes in the superconducting gap function . for both larger or smaller @xmath4",
    ", however , @xmath9 deviates from the @xmath10 dependence even through the @xmath6 value is similar .",
    "this unprecedented finding shows the richness of the physics of this new class of superconductors , and any pertinent theory must explain this peculiar property . in the normal state",
    ", the temperature dependence of @xmath46 indicates that the spin correlations at finite wave - vector become stronger upon decreasing @xmath4 , while the dos increases .",
    "this aspect is different from the case of doped cuprates but can be understood in terms of a single - orbital picture suggested on the basis of lda calculation .",
