    "interaction between itinerant electrons and localized moments in the kondo regime is described by the s - f mixing and the polarization terms in the kondo lattice model .",
    "the polarization term induces a rkky type magnetic correlation , while the s - f mixing causes demagnetization .",
    "the magnetic correlation is dependent on the filling factor ; ferromagnetic for low filling and antiferromagnetic around half filling .",
    "@xcite as the interaction between the conduction electrons and the localized moments increases , the phase evolves to the kondo singlet phase .",
    "in particular , for half - filled case , the phase transition has been shown continuous and the value of critical point has been obtained .",

    "the critical behavior of the magnetizations shows a universal exponent independent of the filling factor and the strength of exchange interaction @xmath2 such that @xmath5 with the critical point @xmath6 .",
    "there emerge two mean fields . the first one , @xmath7 , represents the mean field of the s - f mixing and the other field , @xmath8 , the magnetic correlation between localized moments . as @xmath0 increases , the @xmath7 field increases whereas the @xmath8 field decreases , which indicates a phase transition from the magnetically ordered state to the kondo state . calculated values of the mean fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 explain consistently the the physical situation such as the existence of phase transition between the ferromagnetic ordered state and the kondo singlet state .",
    "a notable feature of the present calculation is the existence of a new antiferromagnetic state at small kondo exchange interaction especially for low filling factors .",
    "the s - f mixing field , @xmath7 , is generally believed to be a monotonously increasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite however , for very small @xmath0 , we find a local minimum of @xmath7 field .",
