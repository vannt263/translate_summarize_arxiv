    "photons are one of the most important observables to explore the properties of high - energy matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , since they are penetrating probes which are free from strong interactions . in recent years , direct photon measurement by the phenix @xcite and the alice collaborations @xcite posed a puzzle to theoretical understanding of photon production .",
    "the direct photon puzzle consists of two issues .",
    "( i ) state - of - the - art theoretical calculations @xcite underestimate direct photon excess measured in experiments @xcite .",
    "( ii ) a large elliptic flow of direct photons comparable in magnitude to that of pions are observed @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to explain these two issues simultaneously because a large direct photon yield favors photon emission at early time when temperature of the system is high , while a large elliptic flow indicates that photons are emitted at later time when the flow of matter is largely developed .",
    "this puzzle naturally drives people to think about a novel mechanism of photon production , e.g. @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the photon spectra measured in p@xmath0p , d@xmath0au , au@xmath0au collisions at rhic and pb@xmath0pb collisions at lhc satisfy geometric scaling .",
    "this result indicates that the photons are emitted in early time when the saturation momentum @xmath1 is the only dominant scale of the system . in the leading order description of the color glass condensate ,",
    "the system right after a heavy - ion collision consists of longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this state is called glasma . the photon production in the glasma",
    "has been studied in refs .",
    "although promising results are presented , these studies are based on a simplified model for the gluon distribution function in the glasma . to obtain deeper understanding of the photon production in the glasma ,",
    "calculations based on a first principle is needed .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to take a first step toward this direction .    in order to investigate the photon production in the glasma ( the central rapidity region of nucleus - nucleus collisions )",
    ", we need to first compute quark production because the initial states described by the color glass condensate ( see e.g. @xcite ) purely consist of gluons , which do not directly couple to photons .",
    "this situation is in contrast to proton - nucleus collisions , where the proton can be viewed as high - energy partons , not as classical gauge fields .",
    "the photon and dilepton production in proton - nucleus collisions have been investigated by calculating the processes that a quark in the proton emits a photon due to the interaction with strong color classical fields of the nucleus @xcite . in the leading order description of the color glass condensate and the glasma , gauge fields",
    "are treated as classical fields because the coupling is small , @xmath2 , and the fields are strong , @xmath3 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the quark dynamics in the leading order is described by retarded solutions of the dirac equation under the classical gauge field . for generic inhomogeneous gauge fields ,",
    "we need to resort to lattice - discretized numerical calculations to solve the dirac equation . in studies of real - time dynamics of fermions on lattice ,",
    "there have been considerable advances @xcite . given these advances",
    ", we will give a first - principle description of the quark dynamics under classical gauge fields , and investigate the induction of electromagnetic ( em ) current accompanying the quark production .",
    "in this paper , we assume a system in a fixed box , namely boost - invariant expansion is not taken into account .",
    "besides we focus on only the one - point expectation value of the em current operator . from the expectation of the current , the spectrum of photons produced by a classical process can be computed .    in the context of real - time lattice simulations of the early - time dynamics in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the color su(2 ) theory is often used instead of the color su(3 ) just for simplicity , and it is sometimes expected that su(3)@xmath4 results would be similar to su(2)@xmath4 . indeed , it has shown that the dynamics of classical gauge fields exhibits no qualitative difference between su(2)@xmath4 and su(3)@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we will show that , however , this is not the case for the induction of em currents . in su(2)@xmath4 , there is a tendency that two color components contribute to the em current with opposite signs to each other .",
    "we will show that this cancellation is exact in uniform fields . on the other hand , in su(3)@xmath4",
    ", the degree of the cancellation between different color components depends on the color direction of background fields .",

    "the effective couplings are independent of the color direction of the gauge field . a quark with color 1 couples to the electric field with the effective coupling of @xmath40 , and it also has an em charge @xmath41 ( we assume @xmath42 ) .",
    "this quark is accelerated to the @xmath43-direction by the electric field and causes a positive em current .",

    "therefore , this quark is accelerated to @xmath45-direction .",
    "although the color charges are opposite in sign between color 1 and 2 , the em charge is independent of the color components . consequently , the quark with color 2 induces a negative current , which cancels the current induced by the quark with color 1 .",
    "the same cancellation happens for anti - quarks . in this way",

    "the numerical cost to compute the mode functions @xmath144 is proportional to @xmath145 because the mode functions depend on both @xmath146 and @xmath147 . to reduce this rather expensive numerical cost",
    ", one can employ a monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we use the deterministic method because we treat gauge fields which are uniform in one direction at least , of which nature reduces the numerical cost . under a gauge field uniform in the @xmath37-direction ,",
    "the @xmath37-dependence of the mode functions @xmath144 is always @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath37-dependence need not be computed numerically . the scaling with the lattice size for the numerical cost to compute the mode functions is modified to @xmath149 .",
    "a merit of the deterministic method is that it is free from statistical errors .",
    "this is beneficial especially when one computes local expectations under inhomogeneous backgrounds .",

    "[ fig : latmom ] shows . in 3-dimensional momentum space , there is 8-fold degeneracy in total .",
    "we call the region @xmath153 the physical region , and the remain the doubler region @xmath154 . a way to decouple the doubler modes from the dynamics",
    "is adding the wilson term to the dirac equation : @xmath155    = 0 \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , we do not employ the wilson term by the following reason .",
    "because the wilson term contains the gauge link , it contributes to the em current .",
    "in addition to the normal contribution , we have @xmath156 .\\ ] ] in the continuum limit , the contribution from the wilson term vanishes since @xmath157 is real",
    ". however , with a nonzero lattice spacing and under a nontrivial gauge field configuration , this contribution stays nonzero and contaminates the normal contribution .",
    "in particular , for the em current , the normal contribution may be small or zero due to the cancellation between different colors as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : uniform ] , and thus the wilson term contribution can be the same order to the normal contribution . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we employ an alternative way to decouple the doubler modes .    because we directly handle the mode functions with the specific initial conditions , we can restrict the momentum @xmath147 of the mode function @xmath144 to the physical modes , @xmath158 . by this , the mode functions which have the momentum index @xmath159 can be simply excluded from the dynamics .",
    "however , the effects of the doubler modes may not be completely eliminated by this procedure since the mode functions have also @xmath146-dependence .",
    "if we fourier - transform the negative - energy mode functions as @xmath160 then the momentum @xmath161 spans over the full momentum space @xmath162 .",
    "there is still a possibility that the doubler modes contaminate the mode functions through the @xmath146-dependence . at the initial time , the mode functions are proportional to the plane wave @xmath163 , so that @xmath164 is diagonal in the momentum space : @xmath165 because we have restricted the momentum @xmath147 to the physical modes , also the momentum @xmath161 is in the physical region . in this sense , the effects of doublers are completely eliminated at the initial time just by the limitation @xmath158 . by the time evolution ,",
    "the contamination by the doubler modes may come in .",
    "this point becomes apparent if we fourier - transform the dirac equation : @xmath166 \\tilde{\\psi}_{\\bp , s , c}^- ( t , \\bp^\\prime -\\bq )   = 0 \\ , ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath167 is the fourier transform of the link variable .",
    "if the gauge field is inhomogeneous , @xmath167 can carry nonzero momentum and the gauge field may kick out quarks from the physical momentum region to the doubler region . by explicitly computing @xmath168 , we can monitor how the contamination occurs .",
    "for that purpose , we consider the following quantity : @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) are integers corresponding to the momenta @xmath86 and @xmath88 ( @xmath174 and @xmath175 ) , respectively . because @xmath168 is always diagonal with respect to @xmath84 and @xmath176 under longitudinally uniform gauge fields we consider in this paper , the sum over the longitudinal momenta is already taken .",
    "thanks to the normalization condition for the mode functions , the function @xmath177 satisfies @xmath178 at the initial time , the function @xmath177 is totally diagonal , @xmath179 it therefore vanishes if @xmath180 since @xmath181 .",
    "figure [ fig : dbl ] exhibits how the function @xmath177 evolves in time under the inhomogeneous gauge field introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : glasma ] . both of the strength and the extent of the inhomogeneity of this gauge field is characterized by the scale @xmath1 . as examples ,",
    "@xmath182 with @xmath183 and @xmath184 are shown . at the initial time",
    "@xmath185 , the @xmath172-distribution is localized at @xmath186 . since the inhomogeneous background gauge field carries nonzero transverse momentum ,",
    "the @xmath172-distribution gets broadened by time evolution .",
    "however , the extent of the broadening is an order of @xmath1 , which is a typical momentum the background field carries , and far smaller than the cutoff momentum . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath172 is near to the border with the doubler region ( the case of @xmath187 , plotted in the right ) , the broadening is weaker than the case @xmath172 is at a low momentum region .",
    "as long as we restrict @xmath188 to the physical region , @xmath189 at the doubler region is not significantly excited . in particular , the zero momentum point of the doubler ( @xmath190 in this case ) is not at all activated .",
    "although we have shown only two examples of the parameters @xmath191 , the broadening is weak for any value of @xmath191 , at least within the timescale of the order of @xmath73 , which we are interested in . to conclude , by restricting the momentum @xmath147 in the index of the mode functions @xmath144 to the physical region",
    ", we can suppress the contamination by doubler modes .",
    "this would be not true if the background field is highly inhomogeneous , or if we continue the time evolution till a late time .",
    "for example , if one reaches thermal equilibrium after a long time evolution , the physical modes and the doubler modes would be equally excited unless one uses other method to suppress doublers .",
    "however , in the background field and time scale we are interested in , the contamination by the doublers does not matter .",
    "this method has an advantage in numerical cost . because we restrict the momentum @xmath147 to the physical region , which has the volume of @xmath192 of the whole momentum space , the numerical cost",
