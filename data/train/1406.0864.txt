    "the schubert calculus of enumerative geometry has come to mean all problems of determining the linear subspaces of a vector space that have specified positions with respect to other , fixed but general subspaces .",
    "originating in work of schubert  @xcite , it has long been an active subject , undergoing significant recent development . as a rich and well - understood class of geometric problems ,",
    "the schubert calculus is a laboratory for the systematic study of new phenomena in enumerative geometry  @xcite , particularly as schubert problems are readily formulated and studied on a computer .",
    "there are two traditional formulations of schubert problems , one in global plcker coordinates and one in the local coordinates of a schubert cell  @xcite .",
    "the first involves quadratic plcker equations and linear equations , while the second uses no plcker equations and the linear equations are replaced by minors of matrices .",
    "both formulations typically involve far more equations than variables .",
    "the second method was used to provide evidence for the shapiro conjecture and discover its generalizations  @xcite through the systematic study of many billions of instances of several thousand schubert problems  @xcite .",
    "these were exact computations , using symbolic methods .",
    "numerical computation should enable the study of far more and far larger schubert problems as well as more delicate monodromy computations on a computer .",
    "for this hope to become a reality , algorithms tailored to schubert calculus need to be developed and implemented  this is starting to occur  @xcite  and methods to certify computation need to be developed .",
    "this second point was highlighted in a proof - of - concept paper to compute monodromy ( galois groups ) of some schubert problems  @xcite .",
    "this included numerically solving a schubert problem with 17589 solutions and numerically computing enough monodromy permutations to conclude that the monodromy was the full symmetric group @xmath1 .",
    "these computations were not proofs in the ordinary sense as they relied upon software heuristics for their conclusions .",
    "this nevertheless inspired the development and implementation of methods to certify computations in numerical algebraic geometry .",
    "certification in numerical algebraic geometry rests upon work of smale , who studied the convergence of iterations of newton s method applied to a point @xmath2 , considered to be an approximate solution to a system @xmath3 of polynomial equations , when the system is square  @xcite .",

    "this was implemented in software  @xcite as an _ a posteri _ test to certify the output of a numerical solver while beltrn and leykin  @xcite developed and implemented a certified path - tracking algorithm which also certifies monodromy computations . in an important special case , _ a posteri _",
    "estimates suffice to certify monodromy  @xcite .",
    "traditional formulations of schubert problems typically lead to overdetermined systems ( more equations than variables ) so algorithms based on @xmath0-theory can not be used to certify traditional numerical computation in schubert calculus .",
    "we present a novel formulation of any schubert problem in primal - dual coordinates as a square system of bilinear equations .",
