    "universal level statistics of classically chaotic systems is an asymptotic ( i.e. semiclassical ) property of a spectrum . for homogeneous systems , such as billiards",
    ", it appears in the high energy limit of the spectrum .",
    "usually there is a preasymptotic regime where the statistics reflects the characteristics of classical or quantum origin specific to the system .",
    "many authors consider classical diffusion and inhibition of quantum diffusion due to localization as the key to understand nonuniversal features of spectra@xcite . in this paper",
    "we are going to study the problem from a periodic orbit point of view .",
    "admittedly , periodic orbit theories based on the semiclassical trace formula@xcite has not been very successful for studies of spectral statistics .",
    "the exception is berry result on the small @xmath5 limit of the form factor @xcite .",
    "this is derived under the so - called _ diagonal approximation _ , an approximation of somewhat obscure validity@xcite .",
    "to simplify the discussion of periodic orbit theories below we will confine ourselves to dispersive billiards consisting of one or several disks , all with radius @xmath6 , inside a rectangle or a torus .",
    "we thus limit the number of relevant length scales to essentially one .",
    "one obvious condition for the trace formula to be applicable is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wave number .",
    "non universal effects are expected to be pronounced for intermediate values of @xmath3 , and are thus to be sought in the region where the validity of the trace formula is dubious .",
    "diffraction plays presumably a much more important role in bound system than in open and the gutzwiller formula has to be amended by sums over diffractive periodic orbits@xcite .",
    "however , it is not obvious how much the inclusion of diffractive orbits will improve the situation .",
    "the _ geometric theory of diffraction _ is very successful for open systems , where it provides small corrections , but its applicability is questionable in the _ penumbra _ of disk scattering in the very forward direction @xcite . the basic problem is the interference between neutral and unstable orbits accumulating towards them .",
    "their respective saddle points are not enough separated and individual eigenstates can hardly be resolved by berry - keating technique .",
    "this should hardly come as a surprise .",
    "the failure of predicting individual eigenvalues in the semiclassical limit has been expected from the very genesis of the trace formula .",
    "the pessimism has partly fallen into oblivion since the success of the berry - keating scheme @xcite .",
    "the harsh moral of this discussion is that it seems not an easy task to pursue periodic theories as a mean to study how universality may emerge as @xmath9 .",
    "the situation turns out to be very different if the opposite limit ( @xmath10 ) is considered .",
    "the disks can now be considered as sources of s - wave diffraction .",
    "the unstable orbits are replaced by purely diffractive orbits .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied the small @xmath3 limit for the one disk case .",
    "the limit is not only much easier to deal with than the opposite , but it is also much richer in behavior . in particular the @xmath11 subspace exhibit a wide range of level statistics in the diffractive region which , due to symmetry effects , extend up to @xmath12 . for ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) the statistics is poissonian and for ( @xmath15 ) it is very close to goe .",
    "it approaches goe properly first in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "one of the questions we are going to address is whether a goe statistics can be achieved by keeping @xmath3 small , but by increasing the number of scatterers , and distribute them randomly over a torus .",
    "we will thus enter the realm of disordered systems .    in random matrix theories one studies ensemble averages of abstract models of disordered systems whereas in quantum chaos one",
    "usually studies self - averages of chaotic systems .",
    "there is a need to study how the predictions of random matrix theories is realized in more concrete models of disordered systems .",
    "we have chosen study spectral statistics for _ individual _ members of our disordered ensembles , for various values of the parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) , although nothing prevented us in principle from studying ensemble averages .",
    "any study of non - universality and approach to universality for a single chaotic systems ( utilizing self - averages of the spectrum ) will suffer from finiteness of the sample .",
    "some type of non - universal effects , like fine wiggles on the formfactor proposed by @xcite may not relevant when applied to a single systems@xcite , but this is not the kind of effect we will be looking at .",
    "the basic motivation in this paper is conceptual rather than physical , although our studies have some bearing on disordered solids and impurity scattering .",
    "the system considered in this paper have obvious similarities with antidot lattices@xcite .",
    "however , presentday antidot lattices are modeled by rather smooth potentials and they lie in the intermediate region @xmath17 ( with @xmath6 suitably defined ) where periodic orbit theories are , least to say , cumbersome .",
    "the outline is as follows .",
    "the eigenvalues are recognized as the zeros of the _ spectral determinant _ , which we will derive within the geometric theory of diffraction .",
    "we will thus focus on the diffractive determinant ( or zeta function ) , associated with periodic orbits with at least one scattering on a diffractive object .",
    "this is formulated in section [ s : def ] .",
    "this object has poles on the real axis so it has to be resummed to tame the divergence caused by these poles .",
    "this is done in section [ s : resum ] . in section",
    "[ s : num ] we discuss some numerical issues . in section [ s : mean ] we derive the man level density of zeros of the diffractive determinant . in section [ s : stat ]",
    "we compute spectra numerically and study their statistics .",
    "in the _ geometric theory of diffraction_@xcite the spectral determinant is split up into a product @xmath18 where @xmath19 corresponds to the mean level density , the geometric part @xmath20 is the gutzwiller - voros zeta function , possibly amended with the neutral orbits .",
    "we will be solely interested in the diffractive determinant @xmath21 .",
    "it has been derived for an non - diffractive system supplied with @xmath0 small disks in ref @xcite .",
    "we thus assume the presence of @xmath0 small diffractive objects located at @xmath22 , where @xmath23 whose diffraction constants @xmath24 do not depend on the scattering angle .",
    "we introduce symbolic dynamics by enumerating the disk from @xmath25 to @xmath0 .",
    "the alphabet is now @xmath26 .",
    "the set @xmath27 is defined as the set of all primitive periodic sequences of symbols taken from this alphabet .",
    "note that the transition @xmath28 does not correspond to _",
    "one _ trajectory from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , as is usual in symbolic dynamics but _ all _ trajectories . to clarify this distinction",
    "we prefer to talk about _ periodic symbol sequences _ rather than _ periodic orbits_.    the diffractive determinant ( or zeta function )",
    "is now given by @xmath31 the weight @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 . and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is the non diffractive(i.e .",
    "the green function for the original system , before the diffractive objects have been inserted ) .",
    "it can , in the semiclassical limit , be decomposed into a sum over all paths @xmath37 from @xmath38 to @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is given by the usual van vleck - gutzwiller expressions @xcite .",
    "we now turn to our particular system ; a rectangle with sides @xmath42 and @xmath43 supplied with periodic boundary conditions , with @xmath0 circular disks at positions @xmath22 where @xmath44 .",
    "all disks have radius @xmath6 and their diffractive constants are given by @xmath45 which applies in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "we will use as @xmath41 the free flight greens function given by @xmath46 instead of the of usual van vleck - gutzwiller , which is obtained by taking the debye approximation of the hankel functions @xmath47 .",
    "the geometric green function now reads @xmath48 where the sum runs over all integer @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "due to a singularity of the hankel function , this expression diverges if @xmath51 .",
    "we define a regularized geometric green @xmath52 function by subtracting this singularity .",
    "the _ diagonal _ green function from a disk to itself is now @xmath53 and the _ off diagonal _",
    "@xmath54    due to the multiplicative expression for the weights @xmath32 ( [ eqn : tpdef ] ) the diffractive determinant , or zeta function , can be computed from the transfer matrix@xcite @xmath55 via @xmath56      the sums ( [ eqn : goff ] ) and ( [ eqn : gdiag ] ) diverge for real e and we will resort to the ewald summation technique as developed in ref .",

    "@xcite , and we omit it .",
    "note that the off diagonal terms are real .    to get a real expression for the determinant ( [ eqn : deltad ] )",
    "vi simply extract a factor @xmath63 from each row @xmath64 where the matrix elements @xmath65 are all real .",
    "the energy dependence enter in the green functions @xmath52 _ and _ in the renormalized diffraction constant @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "we will in computations artificially fix @xmath68 and keep the energy dependence only in the green functions , for reasons to be discussed later .",
    "the numerical issue is to compute the green functions with desired accuracy . through the ewald summation technique",
    "each green function is split up into one sum over the dual lattice and one over the initial lattice @xmath69 .",
    "there is however no closed expression for the function @xmath59 , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ixdef ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the function @xmath59 is @xmath70    as berry noted , for sufficiently small @xmath71 the sum @xmath69 can be neglected , as far as the diagonal green function is concerned .",
    "this is not so for the off diagonal green functions .",
    "they are still small in absolute terms nevertheless significant .",
    "we have chosen to include the sum @xmath69 , and compute the integral ( [ eqn : ixdef ] ) by the asymptotic formula when appropriate . however , for a small number of terms ( a number decreasing with increasing energy ) the integral has to be evaluated numerically . when @xmath72 , where @xmath73 the smallest interdisk distance , this is no longer an issue .",
    "this suggest a small value of @xmath71 .",
    "one the other hand , a large @xmath71 is preferred in the dual lattice sum , so the choice of @xmath71 is a compromise and can be adjusted according to energy .",
    "the determinant was derived in the limit of small @xmath3 .",
    "the first correction will involve the factor @xmath74 so our diffractive determinant should work well whenever @xmath10 . for the @xmath75 case the first correction involved the factor @xmath76 ,",
    "the bessel functions of order 1 - 3 are suppressed due to symmetry effects@xcite .",
    "the diffractive approximation then works for slightly higher @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , we found in @xcite that @xmath3 can be rather close to the limiting @xmath78 ( for @xmath75 ) and presumably rather close to @xmath79 in the general case .",
    "in this section we will focus on the mean density of zeros of the determinant @xmath21 as given in eqs ( [ eqn : deltad ] ) and ( [ eqn : ddm ] ) .",
    "the density of states of the system in the diffractive limit is asymptotically given by weyls expression @xmath80 this density does not need to be reproduced by the diffractive determinant @xmath21 .",
    "it will turn out that the average density of zeros of @xmath21 will depend on the number of scatterers according to @xmath81 that is , the full spectral density is achieved first when @xmath2 .",
    "we will study spectra for fixed values of the parameter @xmath82 for reasons to be discussed in the next section .",
    "but as the result ( [ eqn : bardd ] ) does not depend on the value of @xmath68 , it will also apply to the ( physical ) case where @xmath83 is allowed to vary with energy @xmath84 .    before actually deriving eq ( [ eqn : bardd ] )",
    "we will make some general comments .",
    "the reason why we do nt resolve the full density of states for @xmath75 and @xmath85 has a simple explanation in terms of symmetries of the system .",
    "the wave functions split up into the irreducible representations of the respective group and our leading order determinant can not resolve them all .    if @xmath75 the symmetry is @xmath86 . in a coordinate system with origin at the disk",
    "there is a reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath87 and @xmath88 axis .",
    "we only resolve 1/4 of the full spectral density , namely those states with even parity with respect both axis . to resolve the other subspaces",
    "one would need to take higher order terms in the diffraction constant , and make a proper desymmetrization .",
    "if @xmath85 there is a inversion symmetry with respect to the point @xmath89 and we recover 1/2 of the full spectral symmetry .",
    "it is obvious that for high enough @xmath0 one can avoid this kind of symmetry effects .",
    "it is also obvious that it is possible to construct configurations with large @xmath0 having a high degree of symmetry , like e.g. a regular lattice .",
    "below we will consider generic configurations from some random ensemble for which there is no accidental symmetries of any kind .",
    "we will also assume the absence of exact degeneracies in the unperturbed spectrum .",
    "now to the derivation of eq ( [ eqn : bardd ] ) .",
    "first we show that the mean density of zeros of @xmath90 equals the mean density of poles of the same determinant . to show this can essentially repeat the arguments in ref @xcite .",
    "this was done for a slightly different determinant , but the basic mechanism is the same .",
    "the difference between the two integrated spectral densities is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 a term @xmath94 is just a product of hankel functions and is zero on the mean .",
    "next we will compute the density of poles of @xmath21 .",
    "the poles will be located at the poles of the green functions whose density is @xmath95 .",
    "the problem is to determine their multiplicity @xmath96 .",
    "so far , we have @xmath97    we now study the behavior of @xmath98 ( with @xmath99 defined in ( [ eqn : mij ] ) ) , close to a pole corresponding to the quantum numbers @xmath100 , that is @xmath101 is close to @xmath102 .",
    "the matrix elements are then ( approximately ) given by @xmath103 where we have summed over the four ( dual ) lattice points @xmath104 .",
    "if we introduce the notation @xmath105 and @xmath106 the latter measuring the ( small ) distance to the pole , we get @xmath107 @xmath108 the rank of the matrix @xmath109 is simply the requested multiplicity @xmath96 @xmath110 this rank is the maximum size a matrix having the structure @xmath111 can have with a nonvanishing determinant . to explore this problem we introduce three other matrices @xmath112 we further introduce the notation @xmath113 to mean the @xmath114th column of @xmath115 , and similarly for @xmath116 etc .",
    "the idea is now to write column @xmath113 as the following linear combination @xmath117 and similar relations hold for @xmath116 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the result can be conveniently expressed in terms of matrices .",
    "@xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 and @xmath123 please note that the elements of @xmath124 are scalars , the elements of @xmath125 are column vectors .",
    "the external index @xmath114 has nothing to do with the internal structure of these objects . from the definition we have the relation @xmath126    the basic idea now is to explore whether it is possible to write the column vector @xmath127 as a linear combination of the preceding columns @xmath113 ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "we address the corresponding problem for @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 simultaneously , and write @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a multiplier and @xmath134 is the unit matrix .",
    "we carry on this procedure until we arrive at @xmath135 where @xmath136 or @xmath137 so the first @xmath50 columns of @xmath115 are linearly dependent if and only if we can find multipliers such that @xmath138    the number of multipliers are @xmath139 and the number of equations to fulfill is three .",
    "so for generic parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 the determinant of @xmath115 is zero for @xmath142 .",
    "so @xmath143 . together with eq . (",
    "[ eqn : sofar ] ) the announced result ( [ eqn : bardd ] ) follows .",
    "the disks are distributed randomly over the torus according to a uniform distribution .",
    "we compute spectra for individual members of this ensemble .",
    "we choose the lattice constants to be @xmath144 and @xmath145 , the spectral statistics of the empty torus is than perfectly poissonian ; exact degeneracies are avoided .",
    "the critical parameter is @xmath82 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , statistical studies suffer for finiteness of the sample .",
    "however if @xmath6 is sufficiently small a sufficiently large sample can be obtained with essentially constant @xmath3 .",
    "but as we also demand that @xmath146 this would require too large values of @xmath147 to be numerically tractable .",
    "instead we artificially fix @xmath3 and and compute the bottom part of the spectrum .",
    "we compute around 600 levels for each configuration - computations do get a bit tedious for large @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in two measures on the spectra , the integrated level spacing distribution @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the nearest neighbor spacing distribution .",
    "secondly we investigate the two point correlation function of levels @xmath150 @xmath151 where the average is taken for a large number of energies .",
    "the correlation functions are computed over a gaussian window centered at the middle of the sample spectrum , its width is about one sixth of the sample size .",
    "the results are then smeared with another gaussian having width @xmath152 .    below",
    "we will restrict our attention to spectral properties of the cases @xmath75 and @xmath2 .",
    "the reader should bear in mind that for @xmath75 only a quarter of the full density of states is resolved and the reported result apply to this single subspace .",
    "superposition of all four subspace would result in more poisson - like statistics .",
    "the underlying spectrum of the empty torus reveals itself clearly in the spectrum for large values of @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath75 and @xmath153 the spectrum is poissonian for a trivial reason , the zeros of the determinant have been pushed towards the poles of the green function corresponding to the spectrum of the empty torus , cf . ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath154 four zeros will be pushed towards each pole .",
    "the corresponding limiting integrated level spacing distribution is then @xmath155 this limiting distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : spac4push ] together with results for two different values of @xmath68 ( @xmath156 ) .    for @xmath75 and @xmath157 the states are ,",
    "so to say , repelled by the poles of the green function which result in a spectrum exhibiting level repulsion .",
    "the level spacings distribution is very close to goe , see @xcite and fig .",
    "[ f : spac1and4 ] .",
    "an exact agreement is not possible since the eigenvalues are locked between eigenvalues of the integrable torus .",
    "this locking is released for high enough @xmath0 in fact , the two point correlation function @xmath158 shows a clearer deviation from goe than @xmath159 , see fig .",
    "[ f : tpcdpar0 ] .",
    "one of the main questions is whether goe can be approached as @xmath160 .",
    "increasing @xmath0 only to @xmath161 , keeping @xmath157 ( corresponding to @xmath162 ) yields exactly the opposite result .",
    "the level spacing distribution appears to be perfectly poissonian , see fig .",
    "[ f : spac1and4 ] .",
    "it is known that poisson - like distribution arises from independent superposition of spectra , so one could think that that the determinant ( for some unknown reason ) factorizes",
    ". however , the reported distribution agrees better with the poissonian prediction than with the statistics of four superposed wigner spectra , see fig .",
    "[ f:4super ] .",
    "so the statistics do appear to be poissonian .",
    "one could also reply that @xmath162 is to close to @xmath163 to be physically relevant .",
    "however , we know that for @xmath75 the diffractive approximation is very good close to @xmath162 because a pole blows up the element in the kkr matrix that corresponds to the diffractive approximation , cf @xcite , the same thing should happen if @xmath161 , so we are probably talking about a physical effect .    in fig .",
    "[ f : tpcdpar0 ] we keep @xmath157 constant and increase @xmath0 further .",
    "from now on we restrict our investigations to the correlation function @xmath158 . according to the findings for @xmath75 we expect it to be a better indicator of deviations from goe .",
    "we find that , indeed , the correlator seems to approach that of goe , for @xmath164 it already agrees better with goe than for @xmath75 .",
    "however , as we will see , this result is not restricted too any particular choices of @xmath3 .",
    "next we are going to consider another series of data .",
    "suppose we are increasing @xmath0 and at the same time decreasing @xmath6 in such a way that the fraction of the billiard area occupied by disks are kept constant : @xmath165 .",
    "the corresponding spectra are then studied in the neighborhood of some fixed @xmath147 . for small values of @xmath3",
    "we have@xcite @xmath166 we choose arbitrarily @xmath167 and thus @xmath168 , and we are led to study the sequence @xmath169 the trend is the same , see fig .",
    "[ f : tpclog ] .",
    "the correlation function approaches that of goe , but the approach is of course much slower .",
    "the conclusions suggested by these studies are summarized in table [ t : conc ] .",
    "the result in the lower right corner applies if the limit is approached according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dlog ] ) or something similar .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the emergence of goe in the limit of many small scatterers will hardly cause any big surprise .",
    "the interesting thing is that the result has been studied within the framework of periodic orbit theory .",
    "admittedly , the periodic orbit was not used directly , that would have led to unbearable slow convergence .",
    "we chose the underlying system in such a way that an efficient resummation could be performed .",
    "the similarity between the studied system and ( disordered ) antidot arrays suggests that these can be successfully approached from the the diffractive limit rather than from the gutzwiller limit .",
    "higher order terms in the diffraction constant can be treated as perturbations .",
    "a natural extension of the approach is to apply electric and magnetic fields and study transport properties .",
