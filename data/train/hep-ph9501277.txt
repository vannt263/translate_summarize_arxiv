    "with the advent of precision measurements at lep and the observation that the gauge couplings unify in the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite , there has been a resurgence of interest in supersymmetric grand unified theories . in most analyses the values of the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath4 , and the standard - model weak mixing angle , @xmath5 , are taken from experiment , and converted into supersymmetric parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , using the leading - logarithmic contribution to the supersymmetric threshold corrections .",
    "the parameters are then used to determine the strong coupling constant at the @xmath8-scale , @xmath9 , ignoring all unification - scale threshold corrections .",
    "alternatively , the measured value of @xmath9 is used to constrain the unification - scale parameter space .    in this letter",
    "we will take a closer look at this procedure , and report on the results of a complete next - to - leading - order analysis of supersymmetric unification .",
    "our approach is new in two respects .",
    "first , we include all finite corrections .",
    "this implies that our weak mixing angle @xmath10 is related to @xmath11 as follows , @xmath12 where the leading logarithms are of the form @xmath13 and the finite corrections are of order @xmath14 .",
    "if all the superpartner masses are heavier than a few times @xmath15 , the finite corrections are negligible , in accord with the decoupling theorem",
    ". however , realistic supersymmetric models typically have light particles with masses near @xmath15 , so the finite corrections can be significant .",
    "second , we do not use a combined - fit value of @xmath11 to compute @xmath10 because the finite term in eq .",
    "( [ sintheta ] ) is different for each observable .",
    "therefore , in our analysis , we calculate @xmath10 directly from a given set of inputs , namely , the fermi constant @xmath16 , the @xmath8-boson mass @xmath15 , the electromagnetic coupling @xmath17 , the top - quark mass @xmath18 , and the parameters that describe the supersymmetric model .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "we emphasize that a precise evaluation of @xmath10 is essential because the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) can naturally amplify small corrections .",
    "for example , the one - loop renormalization group equations , @xmath19 , together with gauge coupling unification , imply @xmath20 at any scale @xmath21 . solving for @xmath9 and varying the inputs @xmath6 and @xmath10 , we find @xmath22 this shows that a 1% error in the determination of @xmath10 leads to an error in the evaluation of @xmath9 of 7.5% .    in what follows , we will briefly describe our calculation of @xmath6 and @xmath10 .",
    "we will then examine our prediction for @xmath9 in the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "we will find the unification - scale threshold corrections that are necessary for gauge coupling unification with a given supersymmetric spectrum , and compare our results with the threshold corrections that arise in the minimal and missing - doublet su(5 ) models .",
    "we will close with a similar analysis under the additional assumption of bottom - tau yukawa unification .",
    "we start by sketching our calculation of the gauge parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "as discussed above , we take as inputs the fermi constant @xmath25 gev@xmath26 , the @xmath8-boson mass @xmath27 gev , the electromagnetic coupling @xmath28 , the top - quark mass @xmath18 , and the supersymmetric parameters . from these",
    "we calculate the electromagnetic coupling @xmath6 and the weak mixing angle @xmath10 in the renormalization scheme , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xcite @xmath33 equation ( [ eq : da ] ) includes the light quark contribution extracted from experimental data @xcite , together with the leptonic contribution .",
    "it also contains the logarithms of the @xmath34-boson , top - quark , charged - higgs , squark , slepton , and chargino masses . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dr ] ) , the @xmath35 denote the real and transverse parts of the gauge boson self - energies , evaluated in the scheme .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dr ] ) also includes the vertex and box contributions that renormalize the fermi constant , as well as the leading higher - order @xmath36 and qcd standard - model corrections given in ref .",
    "( for a complete description of our calculation see ref .",
    "note that in this letter , all hatted objects are quantities , and all masses are pole masses . )    from these results we find the weak gauge couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 using the relations @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "these couplings serve as the weak - scale boundary conditions for the two - loop supersymmetric rge s .",
    "they implicitly determine the unification scale @xmath39 through the condition @xmath40 .",
    "we fix the strong coupling @xmath41 at the scale @xmath39 by the unification condition @xmath42 where @xmath43 parametrizes the model - dependent unification - scale gauge threshold correction .",
    "we then run @xmath41 back to the @xmath8-scale to find the coupling @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the weak - scale threshold correction @xmath46    this procedure allows us to determine @xmath9 for a fixed @xmath43 and a given supersymmetric spectrum . in what follows , we will make the additional assumption that the supersymmetric spectrum unifies as well .",
    "therefore we also assume that the three gaugino masses unify to a common value of @xmath47 , the scalar masses unify to a common scalar mass @xmath48 , and the soft trilinear scalar coupling parameters unify to @xmath49 .",
    "we evolve the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 to the weak scale using the two - loop supersymmetric rge s @xcite .",
    "we require the parameters to be such that electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken , as naturally occurs when the top - quark mass is large .",
    "then the higgs bosons @xmath52 and @xmath53 acquire expectation values @xmath54 and @xmath55 ; their ratio is denoted @xmath56 .",
    "we extract the supersymmetric masses from the running parameters and @xmath57 at the scale @xmath15 .",
    "( we choose @xmath58 , where the superpotential contains the term @xmath59 with @xmath60 . )",
    "we then substitute these masses into eqs .",
    "( 4 )  ( 6 ) , and repeat the entire procedure to find a self - consistent solution to the renormalization group equations .",
    "typically , the process converges after only a few iterations .",
    "it allows us to predict @xmath9 consistently , including all finite corrections .    as a point of reference",
    ", we show in fig .  1 our results for @xmath9 in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 plane , in the absence of unification threshold corrections , for @xmath61 gev , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "comparing with the experimental value @xmath64 @xcite , we see that @xmath9 is rather large .",
    "leads to a @xmath65 uncertainty in @xmath9 . ]",
    "if , for naturalness , we require the squark masses to be below 1 tev , we obtain the lower bound @xmath66 assuming the validity of perturbation theory , which we take to mean that the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath67 . if we tighten this condition to @xmath68 , the bound increases by 0.002 . for smaller @xmath18 , @xmath9 is smaller .",
    "for example , if @xmath69 gev , the limit reduces by 0.002 .",
    "these variations apply independently of the unification - scale thresholds .",
    "our numbers agree qualitatively with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "= 3.5 in    the values of @xmath9 quoted here are larger than in many previous analyses for two reasons .",
    "first , during the past few years the central value of @xmath11 , as determined from precision electroweak measurements , has been decreasing .",
    "( this change is correlated with the increasing best - fit value of @xmath18 . )",
    "a smaller value of @xmath11 leads to an increase in @xmath9 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ delta_alpha ] ) .",
    "second , the finite corrections decrease @xmath10 , and therefore increase @xmath9 .",
    "the finite corrections are important in the region @xmath70 gev where @xmath9 is appreciably larger than in the leading logarithmic approximation , as shown in fig .  2 .    of course",
    ", the value of @xmath9 can be reduced by a unification - scale threshold correction with @xmath71 . in the minimal su(5 ) model @xcite , the unification - scale gauge threshold correction is @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mass of the color - triplet higgs fermion that mediates nucleon decay",
    ". also receives contributions from higher - dimensional planck - scale operators that we ignore .",
    "they lead to a @xmath74 uncertainty in @xmath9 @xcite . ] from this expression , we see that @xmath75 whenever @xmath76 . however , @xmath73 is bounded from below by proton decay experiments , so @xmath77 throughout most of the parameter space . gev@xmath78 and @xmath79 . ]    in minimal su(5 ) we find that the smallest possible values for @xmath9 are typically even larger than those in fig .  1 .",
    "the only exception occurs for @xmath80 , where the proton decay amplitude is suppressed .",
    "this determines the lower limit @xmath81 assuming @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , as long as @xmath82 tev , @xmath83 can only be obtained in the region @xmath3 tev .",
    "for example , if @xmath84 gev , @xmath85 .",
    "the missing - doublet model is an alternative su(5 ) theory in which the heavy color - triplet higgs particles are split naturally from the light higgs doublets @xcite . in this model",
    "the unification - scale gauge threshold can be written as @xcite @xmath86 thus , for fixed @xmath73 , the missing - doublet model has the same threshold correction as the minimal su(5 ) model , minus 4% . in eq .",
    "( [ mdmodel ] ) , @xmath87 is the effective mass that enters into the proton decay amplitude , so the bounds on @xmath73 in the minimal su(5 ) model also apply to @xmath87 in the missing - doublet model .",
    "the large negative correction in eq . ( [ mdmodel ] ) gives rise to much smaller values for @xmath9 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  3 , where we show the upper and lower bounds on @xmath43 in the minimal and missing - doublet su(5 ) models , together with the values of @xmath43 necessary",
    "to obtain @xmath88 . for both su(5 ) models we bound @xmath43 from below by the limits on proton decay and from above by the requirement @xmath89 gev .",
    "note that for the missing - doublet model , the region of allowed @xmath43 nearly overlaps the region with @xmath90 , regardless of the supersymmetric particle masses .",
    "in typical su(5 ) models the bottom and tau yukawa couplings unify at the scale @xmath39 . in the remainder of this letter",
    ", we will investigate bottom - tau unification to the same next - to - leading - order accuracy that we used in our analysis of the gauge couplings .",
    "our analysis is based on two - loop rge s and on the complete one - loop expressions that relate the yukawa couplings to the physical fermion masses @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate our procedure for the case of the tau yukawa coupling .",
    "we start by determining the expectation value @xmath91 from the @xmath8-boson mass , @xmath92 then , given the pole mass @xmath93 gev @xcite , we find the tau yukawa coupling @xmath94 using the relation @xmath95 where @xmath96 , and the tau self - energy is @xmath97 .",
    "we follow a similar procedure to find the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath98    once we have the top and tau yukawa couplings at the scale @xmath15 , we evolve them to the scale @xmath39 using the two - loop supersymmetric rge s @xcite . at @xmath39",
    "we fix the bottom - quark yukawa coupling @xmath99 through the unification condition @xmath100 where @xmath101 parametrizes the unification - scale yukawa threshold correction .",
    "we then run all the yukawa couplings back to the @xmath8 scale , and iterate the procedure self - consistently to determine @xmath102 .",
    "finally , we apply the weak - scale threshold corrections to find the pole mass for the bottom quark .    for a top - quark pole mass @xmath103 gev",
    ", this procedure typically gives a bottom - quark mass outside the range of experiment ( which we take to be 4.7 @xmath104 5.2 gev @xcite ) . from previous analyses we know that for @xmath105 gev there are two regions of @xmath57 where bottom - tau unification might occur : @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "here we focus on the small @xmath57 branch , where the top - quark yukawa coupling at the unification scale is large , @xmath108 .    as a point of reference , we first present our results with no unification - scale threshold corrections . in fig .",
    "4 we show @xmath109 and @xmath9 versus @xmath18 , for various values of @xmath57 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , with @xmath110 . from the figure we see that the bottom - quark pole mass is generally too large , unless the squark masses are of order 1 tev .",
    "the value @xmath110 was chosen because it lies on the edge of perturbation theory .",
    "smaller values of @xmath111 give rise to larger values of @xmath109 , so the curves in fig .",
    "4 can be interpreted as lower limits on the bottom - quark mass .",
    "if we require the squark masses to be below 1 tev , we obtain the lower bound @xmath112 in the absence of unification - scale threshold corrections , we see that , in the small @xmath57 region , bottom - tau yukawa unification favors large values of @xmath109 and large values of the supersymmetric mass scale .",
    "the above bound depends slightly on the top - quark mass , and sensitively on @xmath111 . for @xmath69 gev ,",
    "the limit reduces by 0.1 gev . the bound increases by 0.3 gev for @xmath113 and by 0.8 gev for @xmath114",
    ". these variations also apply for @xmath115 .    as with @xmath9 ,",
    "the picture is altered by unification - scale threshold corrections . to understand their effects ,",
    "we first note the striking similarity between the @xmath109 and @xmath9 curves in fig .  4 , which implies that the value of @xmath109 is tightly correlated with the value of @xmath9 .",
    "this leads us to expect that the gauge threshold correction will have an important effect on @xmath109 .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the prediction for @xmath109 versus @xmath18 , for fixed @xmath116 , with @xmath117 and @xmath43 chosen to give a fixed value of @xmath9 .",
    "we see that any model which gives @xmath118 also predicts @xmath119 gev , with @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , any @xmath121 gives an acceptable value for @xmath109 in this case .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath122 , a large and negative @xmath101 is required to achieve the central value for @xmath109 , namely @xmath123 .",
    "figure 5 shows that these conclusions hold independently of the top - quark mass and the supersymmetric mass scale .    in fig .",
    "6 we plot the most favorable values of @xmath9 and @xmath109 in the minimal su(5 ) model . in this model",
    "the yukawa threshold is given by @xcite @xmath124\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath125 is the mass of the superheavy su(5 ) gauge bosons .",
    "we define the most favorable value as follows .",
    "we first minimize the value of @xmath9 by picking the smallest possible @xmath73 consistent with nucleon decay .",
    "we then minimize @xmath109 by choosing the smallest @xmath125 allowed by the constraint that the su(5 ) model yukawa couplings remain perturbative , @xmath126 . from the figure we see that this brings @xmath109 to an acceptable range for squark masses of order 1 tev .",
    "indeed , we find the limit further by increasing @xmath73 , which decreases @xmath127",
    ". however , the corresponding increase in @xmath9 compensates for this so that the limit in eq .",
    "( [ mb lim ] ) remains unchanged . ]",
    "@xmath128    in contrast to minimal su(5 ) , the missing - doublet model can readily accommodate bottom - quark masses in the range @xmath129 , with @xmath130 .",
    "for example , with @xmath61 gev and @xmath131 gev , minimal su(5 ) requires @xmath101 in the range @xmath132 to @xmath133 .",
    "the missing - doublet model , however , requires @xmath101 in the range @xmath134 to @xmath135 . hence even for small @xmath136(100 gev ) supersymmetric masses the missing - doublet model naturally accommodates both gauge and yukawa coupling unification .",
    "in this paper we have computed the complete one - loop weak - scale threshold corrections in the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "we used them to study gauge and yukawa unification with and without unification - scale threshold corrections . in the absence of such corrections",
    "we find that @xmath9 and @xmath109 are large unless the squark masses are larger than about 1 tev . adding minimal su(5 ) threshold corrections , and requiring @xmath82 tev",
    ", we find that @xmath83 occurs only for @xmath2 and @xmath3 tev .",
    "additionally , the condition @xmath137 gev is fulfilled only for @xmath138 tev . in the missing - doublet model , however , the threshold corrections permit acceptable values for @xmath9 and @xmath109 for either a light or heavy supersymmetric spectrum .",
