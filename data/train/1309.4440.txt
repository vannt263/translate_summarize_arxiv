    "although a large variety of x - ray quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been observed in galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) , they are hardly seen in galactic nuclei , which are believed to harbor supermassive black holes ( smbhs , black hole ( bh ) mass @xmath3 ) .",
    "if bh - mass scaling works , qpos from smbhs will have much longer timescales and thus be much better resolved in time than those from bhbs .",
    "therefore qpos from smbhs can shed new lights on the origin of qpos and in turn on the behavior of accretion flows onto bhs .",
    "currently the two most confident cases are the @xmath01.0 hr qpo from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ( @xmath0@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite ) and the @xmath0200 s one from ( @xmath0@xmath5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a tidal disruption event ( tde ) candidate , in which a star approaching the central smbh was tidally disrupted and subsequently accreted .",
    "we discovered ( j1231 + 1106 hereafter ) as a very soft source , untypical of agns , in our project of classifications of 4330 x - ray sources from the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog @xcite .",
    "we have reported some results of our study of this source in @xcite , including the discovery of a possibly strong but transient qpo and very soft spectra ( characteristic blackbody ( bb ) temperatures of 0.10.15 kev , no significant emission above 2 kev ) from three  observations .",
    "this source was also independently discovered by @xcite , who also reported its very soft spectra and possible presence of a qpo , which , however , did not seem statistically significant to them .",
    "they suggested the source as an agn , considering its coincidence with a slightly extended sdss source .",
    "@xcite obtained a magellan optical spectrum of this counterpart in 2012 , which exhibited as a type 2 agn ( redshift @xmath6 , the source luminosity distance of 532 mpc , assuming a flat universe with @xmath7=73 km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 and @xmath9=0.27 ) .",
    "the narrow lines have very small velocity dispersions ( @xmath10 km  s@xmath8 for [ oiii ] @xmath115007 ) , suggesting a small bh mass ( @xmath12 ) .    in this letter",
    "we continue to study j1231 + 1106 .",
    "different from @xcite , we calculate the significance of the qpo formally , carry out detailed spectral fits , concentrating on the physical model by @xcite , and present two _ swift _ follow - up observations . in section  [ sec : reduction ] , we describe the data analysis . in section  [ sec : res ] , we present the results .",

    "xmm1 was made in 2003 july , and xmm2 and xmm3 in 2005 december , with only four days apart .",

    "figures  [ fig:107102foldcurve ] and [ fig:107102foldcurve2 ] show the timing properties of j1231 + 1106 ( see also figure 6 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as obtained by @xcite , the source showed a large coherent oscillation at a period about 3.8 hr in the two observations ( xmm2 and xmm3 ) in 2005 december but not clearly in the one ( xmm1 ) in 2003 july .",
    "the qpo concentrates in one frequency bin ( figure  [ fig:107102foldcurve]a ) , and the quality factor , defined as the centroid frequency divided by the frequency width ( full - width at half - maximum ) , is @xmath15 ( table  [ tbl : sppds107102 ] ) .",
    "the oscillation is only quasi - periodic , considering that the minima and maxima of the light curves in xmm2 and xmm3 do not seem to be well in phase ( figure  [ fig:107102foldcurve]c ) .",
    "assuming blind search over frequencies below 0.1 hz ( the highest stable orbital frequency around a non - rotating bh of @xmath125 ) in each observation separately , we obtained the 99.9% confidence limit in figure  [ fig:107102foldcurve]a ( the dashed line ) and the qpo significance at the 3.1@xmath126 ( gaussian probability , the same below ) and 4.0@xmath126 levels in xmm2 and xmm3 , respectively , assuming the pl model for the red noise ( @xmath127 , 0.22 kev ) . considering that the qpo was detected at the same frequency in two observations , its global significance is 6.7@xmath126 .",
    "the monte carlo simulations confirmed the significance to be @xmath1286.2@xmath126 .",
    "the significance is 5.1@xmath126 if we assumed @xmath118 . using the broken pl model for the red noise ,",
    "the qpo significance is 6.4@xmath126 , 5.4@xmath126 and 5.9@xmath126 for ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) = ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 1 , 3 ) and ( 0 , 2 ) , respectively , from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the fractional root - mean - square ( rms ) variability in the qpo is remarkably high and increases from @xmath025% in 0.20.5 kev to @xmath050% in 12 kev in both xmm2 and xmm3 but is consistent with zero in xmm1 ( table  [ tbl : sppds107102 ] ) .",
    "the folded light curves in these two energy bands are plotted in figure  [ fig:107102foldcurve2 ] , and we see no clear time lag between them ( @xmath1291.1 ks from table  [ tbl : sppds107102 ] ) .",
    "the fitting results of the  observations with various models are given in table  [ tbl : sppds107102 ] .",
    "we concentrated on x - ray spectra , because in optical the source appeared red ( table  [ tbl : sppds107102 ] ) and should be dominated by galaxy emission , instead of nuclear accretion , as often seen in low - mass agns @xcite . in the uv ,",
    "the source was detected in the uvw1 filter , but with large uncertainties .",
    "it still appeared a little red in the uvw1 and uvw2 filters from the two _ swift _ observations ( section  [ sec : swobs ] ) .",
    "thus we will refer to the shortest - wavelength detection , i.e. , the uvw2 one in sw2 , as possible emission from nuclear accretion .",
    "all three spectra are very soft , with @xmath130 0.130.15 kev or @xmath131 0.160.20 kev ( source rest frame ) .",
    "the fits with the bb model show systematic residuals , which are unseen using the mcd model ( figure  [ fig:107102spfits]a ) .",
    "both models infer little intrinsic absorption .",
    "we see that the inner disk temperature varies at a significance level of @xmath132 while the inner disk radius is consistent within the 90% confidence errors in these observations , implying the disk luminosity @xmath133 to approximately follow the relation of @xmath134 .",
    "the source reached a peak 0.310 kev absorbed luminosity of 3.6@xmath13510@xmath136  and a bolometric unabsorbed luminosity of 8.5@xmath13510@xmath136  ( the mcd model ) in xmm2 .",
    "xmm1 is the faintest , with a 0.310 kev absorbed luminosity of 1.6@xmath13510@xmath136  and a bolometric unabsorbed luminosity of 5.0@xmath13510@xmath136 .",
    "both the bb and mcd models under - predicted the sw2/uvw2 flux , by a factor of @xmath0@xmath125 and 48 , respectively ( using the best - fitting model to xmm1 and assuming the reddening @xmath137 , the same below ) .",
    "we used the mcd model to check the spectral variability in the oscillation .",
    "we created and fitted two spectra from xmm2 from the high - flux and low - flux intervals , corresponding to the pn 1 ks 0.22 kev count rate higher and lower than 0.05 counts  s@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the column density was fixed at the value obtained above from the simultaneous fit to all three  observations .",
    "the best - fitting models are shown in figure  [ fig:107102spfits]b .",
    "we inferred a lower temperature and a smaller inner radius of the disk in the low - flux interval than in the high - flux interval , but only at a 1.7@xmath126 confidence level .",
    "we next look at the optxagnf model .",
    "it assumes that the gravitational energy released in the disk is emitted as a color - corrected bb down to a ( coronal ) radius @xmath138 , while within this radius the available energy is distributed between powering two comptonization components : the soft one via comptonization in an optically thick cool corona and the hard one in an optically thin hot corona .",
    "considering the very soft spectra , we first investigated the scenario of pure thermal disk emission ( setting @xmath138 to be at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) ) .",
    "the fitting results for two cases are given in table  [ tbl : sppds107102 ] : a non - rotating schwarzschild bh ( models ( c ) ) and a maximally - rotating kerr bh ( models ( d ) ) .",
    "they inferred @xmath139  and @xmath140 , and the eddington ratio @xmath1412 and @xmath1420.2 , respectively .",
    "both cases under - predicted the sw2/uvw2 flux by a factor of @xmath020 .",
    "we then considered soft comptonization to describe the spectra ( no hard comptonization because of no clear hard x - ray emission ) .",
    "we found that the data could not constrain all paramenters well .",
    "we thus only report two special cases in table  [ tbl : sppds107102 ] : the first case assumes @xmath143  ( model ( e ) ) , and the second case includes the sw2/uvw2 detection in the fits ( model ( f ) ) . because the optical depth @xmath80 of the corona was found to be consistent within the 90% errors , we tied it to be the same for all observations in both cases .",
    "we found that the former case under - predicted the sw2/uvw2 flux by a factor of 11 . in the latter case , @xmath144  and @xmath1450.14 were inferred .",
    "the source was not detected in the xrt in either _ swift _ observation .",
    "we estimated a 0.32 kev count rate of @xmath146 counts  s@xmath8 and @xmath147 counts  s@xmath8 ( the errors are the 90% confidence bounds ) from sw1 and sw2 , corresponding to a 0.310 kev absorbed luminosity of ( @xmath148)@xmath13510@xmath149  and ( @xmath150)@xmath13510@xmath149  ( based on the mcd fit to xmm1 ) , respectively .",
    "thus the source probably has become fainter . in the uv",
    ", we obtained the sw1/uvw1 flux of @xmath151  ( ab mag of @xmath152 ) , and the sw2/uvw2 flux of @xmath153  ( ab mag of @xmath154 ) .",
    "we have shown that j1231 + 1106 exhibited a @xmath03.8 hr qpo in the two  observations in 2005 at a @xmath0@xmath1 significance level , making it one of the very few smbhs with an x - ray qpo significantly detected .",
    "its rms generally increases with energy , a trend also observed in most qpos in galactic bhbs and that in @xcite .",
    "galactic bhbs can show both low - frequency ( @xmath00.130 hz ) and high - frequency ( 40450 hz ) qpos @xcite .",
    "the former can have rms @xmath12815% , while the latter have rms @xmath01% .",
    "if the qpo in j1231 + 1106 corresponds to the low - frequency type in bhbs , we infer @xmath155 .",
    "high - frequency qpos in bhbs sometimes display in pair with frequencies scaling in a 3:2 ratio and possibly following the relation of @xmath156 hz , where @xmath157 is the fundamental frequency of the pair @xcite . using this relation , @xmath63 in j1231",
    "+ 1106 is @xmath158 or @xmath159 , depending on whether we observed the periodicity of @xmath160 or @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "if we assume instead the qpo centroid frequency to be the keplerian frequency at the isco , @xmath63 would be within @xmath162@xmath163 , depending on the spin of the bh .",
    "considering the small bh mass ( @xmath0@xmath2 ) inferred by @xcite from narrow optical emission lines and the large rms , the qpo in j1231 + 1106 is probably a low - frequency type .",
    "this qpo should have a different origin from those in and because the latter two qpos are contributed mostly by the hard x - ray component @xcite .",
    "considering the probably high eddington ratios of j1231 + 1106 , the qpo could be due to thermal instability , which was often used to explain the `` limit - cycle '' behavior of the bhb at high accretion rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ultrasoft x - ray spectra of j1231 + 1106 in the  observations appear broader than a single - temperature bb , but can be described with either pure thermal disk emission or soft comptonization , with @xmath164 consistent with that inferred from narrow optical emission lines .",
    "the former model is supported by the observation of the disk luminosity approximately following the relation of @xmath165 expected for a standard disk , although the dynamical range is small ( only a factor of @xmath02 ) .",
    "the latter model is supported by the detection of the qpo , which , in the case of galactic bhbs , often occurs in states with strong comptonization @xcite .",
    "both models under - predict the sw2/uvw2 flux by more than one order of magnitude , unless , for the soft comptonization model , we assumed a bh mass ( @xmath0@xmath166 ) much larger than that inferred from narrow optical emission lines and eddington ratios ( @xmath00.1 ) too low to see strong soft comptonization @xcite .",
    "thus the sw2/uvw2 flux is probably dominated by galaxy emission .",
    "therefore , both the strong fast variability , whose power is mostly in the qpo , and the spectral modeling suggest j1231 + 1106 as a relatively small bh accreting at high rates .",
    "this is a popular explanation for narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and j1231 + 1106 could be an extreme case of such object , with only soft excess ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the source could be in a pure thermal state hardly observed in agns .",
    "this scenario was suggested by @xcite for , a source showing many similarities as j1231 + 1106 ( e.g. , no hard x - ray detection , strong fast variability , and no broad h@xmath167 or h@xmath168 lines ) and having uv - to - x - ray spectra consistent with pure thermal disk emission . in either case , the non - detection of broad h@xmath167 or h@xmath168 lines in j1231 + 1106 should indicate their absence , instead of being hiddened",
    ". this could be because the source had too weak hard x - ray emission to maintain the broad line region in equilibrium , or because the source only entered the current bright state recently , leaving no enough time to form the mature broad line region @xcite .",
    "however , ultrasoft x - ray spectra are more commonly seen in tdes .",
    "such events are expected to rise on timescales of months and decay on timescales of years , with the accretion rate approximately following @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the time since disruption , if the disrupted stars are solar - type @xcite .",
    "about a dozen tde candidates have been found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for j1231 + 1106",
    ", xmm1 is @xmath02.5 yr before xmm2 and xmm3 , with comparable fluxes .",
    "if it is a tde , xmm1 should be in the rising phase , and xmm2 and xmm3 in the decay .",
    "the bolometric luminosity in 2013 would then decrease from those in xmm2 and xmm3 by a factor of @xmath010 , consistent with the _ swift _ observations .",
    "the absence of broad h@xmath167 or h@xmath168 lines in the magellan spectrum in 2012 could be because the source is too faint now , and the narrow emission lines are light echo from the tde .",
    "alternatively , the disrupted star is an evolved one , in which case the events have much longer timescales than those involving solar - type stars @xcite ( this might also explain , which showed no significant variability in the @xmath01 yr monitoring by _ swift _ in 20102011 , but at fluxes a factor of @xmath128240 of those in the _ rosat _ observations in 1994 ) . under the tde explanation , the qpo could be due to the special accretion mode in such events ."
