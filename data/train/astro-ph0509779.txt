    "as the available instrumentation on large telescopes has pushed observations into the near - infrared ( nir ) , the denizens of the so - called `` redshift desert '' from @xmath6 have increasingly become targets of concerted study .",

    "it often proves difficult however to distinguish starbursting galaxies with an ordered disk morphology from those actively experiencing protogalactic assembly since the relevant angular scales are barely resolved under typical ground - based seeing conditions , and the rest - frame uv light ( e.g. as observed in the optical by the hubble space telescope ) is dominated by emission from bright , clumpy star - forming regions .    long - slit nebular emission line spectroscopy has enabled velocity curves to be derived for a sample of high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. pettini et al .",

    "however , ground - based long - slit spectroscopy suffers from severe atmospheric seeing problems ( as demonstrated by erb et al .",
    "2004 ) , and recovered velocity curves for morphologically selected potentially disk - like galaxies at redshift @xmath5 often show little to no spatially resolved velocity shear ( erb et al . 2004 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this lack of velocity shear may be that these sources are composed of proto - galactic fragments of angular size below the typical seeing limit ( @xmath9 in the @xmath10-band ) .",
    "given the small apparent angular size of these sources ( radius @xmath11 ) compared to that of the seeing disk ( @xmath12 ) , high spatial resolution data from ground - based telescopes has only recently become available through the aid of adaptive - optics ( ao ) technology .",
    "the advent of integral - field spectrographs ( ifs ) on 10m - class telescopes equipped with laser - guide star adaptive optics systems offers the new possibility of mapping the kinematics of galaxies at @xmath13 2 on the scale of tenths of an arcsecond or less . not only can such ao - fed spectrographs mitigate the seeing - induced uncertainties inherent in velocity curves derived from long - slit spectra , but their integral - field capability will provide two - dimensional velocity maps from which it may be possible to reconstruct the kinematic profiles of these galaxies on scales of a few hundred parsecs .",

    "however , this flux will generally be a source of additional background noise - if the flux is spilled from a region of the source with a very different line - of - sight velocity it will contribute this flux at the corresponding wavelength and hinder precise measurement of the spectral peak of flux originating from a given lenslet . modeling this complex effect in detail",
    "requires _ a priori _ knowledge of the velocity substructure of the source , and we therefore generally assume that all such spilled flux adds to the noise of the observation rather than the signal . in  2.2 and  3.4 where we adopt specific velocity models however , spilled light is treated comprehensively as a function of both angular position and wavelength .      using the quantities derived it is possible to calculate the s / n ratio expected for detection of a particular spectral line in each lenslet .",

    "hand - processing by an experienced individual appears to be the most reliable method of measuring velocity centroids , although such a method is impractically time - consuming for extensive simulations with hundreds of spectra apiece .",
    "instead , we adopt an automated routine which fits a gaussian profile to the background - subtracted spectra using a levenberg - marquardt fitting algorithm ( a non - linear least - squares regression algorithm similar to that used in the standard iraf routine _ splot _ ) and measures the velocity shift of the peak flux from the systemic redshift . this method is found to perform reliably for most spectral features with s / n ratios @xmath71 , although some particularly faint features which are not handled well by this automated method may still yield useful information when individually hand - processed .",
    "we note that for the case of spectrographs whose output is in the form of data cubes , one - dimensional observational spectra may be extracted for each spatial element , and may then be processed in entirely the same manner as these simulated spectra .",

    "these four sources were selected because they all have long - slit h@xmath43 spectra , two of them ( bx 1332 , 1397 ) with actual tilted velocity curves , and generally have elongated or multiple - component morphologies .",

    "these h@xmath43 fluxes are used to scale the acs @xmath44-band ( f450w ) images to generate h@xmath43 flux maps as described in  2.1.2 . in each case",
    "we assume that the velocity dispersion is negligible within a single spatial sample . within the sample",
    "is less than @xmath105 ( @xmath106 km s@xmath30 for spectral resolution @xmath107 ) .",
    "this translates to a total velocity dispersion for a source of angular size 1 arcsecond ( with a smoothly varying velocity field ) of about 300 km s@xmath30 using 100 mas sampling , and 1500 km s@xmath30 using 20 mas sampling . ]",
    "s / n ratio maps of these four galaxies are given in figure [ snmap1.fig ] , and show that in a four hour integration we expect to obtain numerous spectra with s / n ratios @xmath108 5 ( red pixels ) across the source if a lenslet scale of 100 mas is used ( as expected on the basis of fig .",

    "figure [ snmap2.fig ] illustrates the s / n ratios expected in the same integration time for bx 1332 using the four available lenslet scales of 20 , 35 , 50 , and 100 mas ( panels a - d respectively ) .",
    "clearly , 20 and 35 mas sampling scales are unlikely to be of use for observations of @xmath5 galaxies since peak s / n ratios for emission line detection are less than or of order unity in a four hour exposure , indicating that the integration times required to achieve detectable signals are prohibitively large .",
    "as demonstrated by panel ( c ) , 50 mas sampling scales could nonetheless prove of use when spatially binned , for brighter sources , or for those sources in which emission regions resolve out into identifiable point sources .    in the event that the assumption of negligible velocity dispersion within a single lenslet were to break down ( as when observing an agn ) , the line emission would be spread over a greater number of detector pixels , increasing the noise in the detection and resulting in s / n ratios somewhat lower than found for unresolved line emission .      as described in  2.2 , detecting line emission in a given lenslet",
    "does not necessarily mean that it will be possible to measure a value of the velocity centroid to within an accuracy necessary for studying velocity substructure ( i.e. tens of km s@xmath30 ) since severe contamination of the light in a given lenslet by spillover from a bright nearby component may mask the velocity signature .",
    "we therefore test how accurately we can expect to reconstruct the velocity field of bx 1332 given two possible kinematic models for the system .    in a previous study using long - slit keck / nirspec spectroscopy erb et al .",
    "( 2004 ) observed a tilted velocity curve along the major axis of bx 1332 ( fig .",
    "[ velcurves.fig ] , filled squares ) , but the high degree of correlation among their data points due to atmospheric seeing ( @xmath109 arcsec ) meant it was uncertain whether the tilted velocity curve was due to ordered disk rotation , or simply to two clumps merging or otherwise passing each other at some relative velocity .",
    "we therefore construct two kinematic models for this source : 1 ) a disk exhibiting solid - body rotation for which the size , inclination , and position angle , and an inclination to the line of sight @xmath110 .",
    "the projected radial velocity is set to be 50 km s@xmath30 at the edge of the disk ( erb et al .",

    "are chosen so that the projected ellipsoid roughly traces the contours where the s / n ratio is equal to 3 in figure [ snmap2.fig ] ( panel d. ) , 2 ) a bimodal velocity distribution in which the velocities of the northwest and southeast regions are separated by the total observed velocity gradient ( @xmath4 100 km s@xmath30 ) . in each case , the intrinsic velocity dispersion within a given spatial sample is assumed to be negligible .",
    "these velocity maps are superimposed on the line flux map ( generated as described in  3.3 ) on a pixel - to - pixel basis .",
    "while there are many uncertainties and degeneracies in this method the exact set of parameters used for the two models is of little consequence since we are primarily interested in how well we can distinguish between two fundamentally distinct kinematic models on the basis of velocity maps reconstructed from simulated observational data (  2.1.4 and 2.2 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ velfig.fig ] , which plots the hst - acs @xmath44-band image of bx 1332 ( panel a. ) , the s / n ratio map for spectral line detection ( panel b. ) , and the velocity map recovered from a 4-hour exposure using the techniques described in  2.2 for both rotating disk and bimodal velocity models ( panels c. & d. respectively ) .",
    "based on long - slit keck / nirspec observations , it would not be possible to distinguish these two kinematic models . adopting a rough model of the nirspec spectrograph with spectral resolution @xmath112 in the @xmath10 band , figure [ velcurves.fig ]",
    "overplots the erb et al .",
    "( 2004 ) observational data with model velocity curves recovered from simulations assuming a rotating disk model ( solid line ) and a bimodal velocity model ( dotted line ) .",
    "although these two model velocity curves are generally quite similar , a chi - squared analysis prefers the disk model over the bimodal model with a chi - square probability function of 0.02 compared to @xmath113 .",
    "however , this distinction is deceptive , since a bimodal velocity model with identical shape but 80% the dynamic range in velocity produces a chi - square fit as good as for the disk model .",
    "since the velocity amplitude of the source is uncertain to within about 20% , we conclude that both rotating disk and bimodal velocity models are equally consistent with the nirspec velocity curve .",
    "in contrast , with ifs , adaptive optics , and increased spectral resolution , simulations of osiris were able to clearly distinguish between the two models : in panel ( c ) of figure [ velfig.fig ] the velocity map shows a smooth transition from redshift to blueshift ( relative to systemic ) over the entirety of the source , while in panel ( d ) only a few pixels on the boundary between the two clumps give intermediate recovered velocities ( since residual atmospheric seeing blurs the light from the two clumps into a slightly broader emission feature at close to the systemic redshift ) . we therefore conclude that osiris will in some cases be capable of distinguishing between rotating disks and two - component mergers previously indistinguishable with long - slit spectrographs alone",
    ". however , bx 1332 is a particularly extended source , which makes it more amenable to study than most galaxies at similar redshifts and for faint , compact , or particularly disordered and chaotic systems obtaining accurate kinematic information for component features may prove challenging since residual atmospheric seeing may blur the combined emission lines into broader emission features .",
    "a comprehensive study of velocity recovery from a wide variety of kinematic models using osiris modeling is underway , and will hopefully determine general classes of galaxies which osiris is capable of distinguishing between on the basis of observed 2d velocity information . in future ,",
    "the ability to draw such distinctions may allow us to test the predictions of heirarchical formation theory by quantifying the relative star formation rates in massive disks versus in proto - galactic mergers at high redshift .",
    "in addition to providing valuable kinematic information , osiris stands to provide high quality broadband , narrowband , and emission - line morphologies and photometry of galaxies both at high redshift and in the local universe . since roughly 80% of the wavelength range covered by",
    "the instrument is free of atmospheric oh emission , it will be possible to sum only those spectral channels free of contamination to reach effective backgrounds up to 3 magnitudes fainter ( in the @xmath79-band ) than possible with standard photometry .",
    "narrowband photometry will thus in a sense come `` free '' with kinematic studies , and the observer will be free post - observing to use the data cube to create any of a number of desirable data products . since for photometric purposes all emission in a given lenslet may be summed regardless of small velocity shifts , photometry of @xmath3 star - forming galaxies will be possible on scales of at least 50 mas , and possibly below .",
    "such photometric and morphological data will present complementary information to the kinematic data , and will likely be of use in interpreting kinematic results .",
    "having explored the scientific promise of osiris for the @xmath5 galaxy sample we extend our discussion to consider basic design specifications for an arbitrary ground - based telescope and their impact on possible targets for integral - field spectroscopy . as the range of parameter space is too broad to cover fully ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to considering an osiris - like ifs with mechanical and electrical specifications as detailed in  3.1",
    ". this study will therefore be specific to osiris - type spectrographs and mauna kea - like atmospheric conditions but will indicate general trends .",
    "we begin by considering the limiting line fluxes which keck / osiris will be able to detect at the 5@xmath0 level in one hour of integration .",
    "were detector noise negligible , then for a `` large '' and uniformly bright extended source ( i.e. a source for which strehl and psf losses may be neglected ) this line flux density would be roughly independent of lenslet sampling scale since both sky background and line flux scale with the area @xmath114 of sky subtended by a lenslet .",
    "however , as demonstrated previously in figure [ mintime.fig ] , detector noise dominates the noise budget at most wavelengths so while line flux still decreases with the lenslet area the noise within a given lenslet remains approximately constant .",
    "as indicated in figure [ limlenslet.fig ] , the limiting line flux therefore tends to increase dramatically as lenslet size shrinks .",
    "unsurprisingly , this increase in limiting flux is less rapid for unresolved point sources .",
    "increasing telescope aperture for an ao - enabled telescope affects the limiting line flux both by increasing the photon collection area and by concentrating the psf of the diffraction limited image , effectively increasing signal in proportion to the primary mirror diameter @xmath115 . the net effect as a function of wavelength",
    "is shown in figure [ limtdiam.fig ] for telescopes with @xmath116 , 10 , 30 , and 50 meters .",
    "in addition to the improvements in limiting flux , 30-m and larger class telescopes will also permit spatially resolved studies at finer angular scales than possible with current generation instruments since the diffraction limit of a 30-m telescope is @xmath4 18 mas in the @xmath10 band ( roughly one third that of the keck telescope ) .    to illustrate this point we repeat our earlier calculations of the expected s / n ratios for detection of emission from star forming regions using a simulated thirty - meter class telescope ( tmt ) in combination with an osiris - like spectrograph .",
    "as shown in figure [ snztmt.fig ] , with this configuration even spatially extended sources observed with lenslet sampling scales of 35 mas ( @xmath4 300 pc at redshift @xmath117 ) provide reasonable detections for spectroscopically unresolved emission lines at redshifts up to @xmath117 in only an hour of integration . on scales of 100 mas , tmt is likely to provide h@xmath43 spectra for point - like regions forming stars at a rate of 1 @xmath94 yr@xmath30 with a peak s / n ratio of 50 + , permitting detailed study of even the fainter components of target galaxies .",
    "as discussed in  3.2 thermal emission dominates the @xmath10-band background , particularly for large aperture telescopes .",
    "this emission comes from telescope primary and secondary mirrors , re - imaging optics in the ao system light path , and atmospheric contributions .",
    "although the latter is uncontrollable for ground - based instruments , it is of obvious interest to attempt to minimize the contribution from optical components ( fig .",
    "[ kbackground.fig ] ) .    in figure [ limcryo.fig ]",
    "we plot the limiting line flux at @xmath10-band wavelengths for a 30-m class telescope operated under a range of thermal conditions .",
    "assuming it were possible to cryogenically cool the ao bench to @xmath118 , the thermal emission from the ao system would become largely negligible compared to that from the telescope and atmosphere , pushing the limiting flux in the @xmath10-band a factor of three lower .",
    "if , in addition , it were possible to achieve near - perfect reflectivity from the telescope mirrors , then the combined reduction in background flux would reduce the limiting line flux by a factor of almost ten .",
    "this improvement is most noticeable around wavelengths of 2.2 - 2.4 microns where the atmosphere is particularly transparent , and we therefore gain the most from suppressing emission from optical components .",
    "longward of 2.4 microns however the improvement becomes less pronounced as atmospheric emission begins to increase rapidly .",
    "it is therefore an attractive goal for next - generation telescopes to cryogenically cool their adaptive optics system since a temperature change of only 20 degrees ( coupled with increased mirror reflectivity ) may suffice to increase sensitivity in the @xmath10-band by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this 20 degrees of cooling would reduce thermal emission from the ao system to the level of the background sky , so additional cooling ( e.g. to liquid nitrogen temperatures @xmath119 k ) would not greatly decrease the background further . such a cooling system should not pose a great technological challenge ( c. max , private communication ) , although it would somewhat increase the cost and complexity of such a telescope project .",
    "moderate spectral resolution ( @xmath120 3000 ) is necessary for spectroscopic studies of high redshift galaxies , largely so that individual atmospheric oh emission lines may be suppressed , and in general the greater the resolution the greater the range of wavelengths for which it will be possible to achieve inter - line background levels .",
    "in addition , high spectral resolution aids in the successful recovery of velocity substructure , and spectrograph resolution must be great enough that it is possible to measure velocities to within tens of km s@xmath30 .",
    "we note , however , that the benefits of increasing spectral resolution do not continue indefinitely , but peak when emission lines in a lenslet are just barely unresolved , beyond which detector noise begins to grow as the line emission is spread over a greater number of pixels .",
    "adaptive optics is a key component for integral - field observations of targets whose angular size is less than or comparable to the size of the seeing disk .",
    "most importantly , ao correction concentrates an appreciable fraction of emitted light into the psf core of the lenslet subtending the region from which that light was emitted , greatly increasing the signal strength from point sources and permitting improved imaging of structures blurred together in the seeing disk .",
    "we note however that for slightly larger sources ( @xmath121 arcsec@xmath122 ) atmospheric seeing may also be partially corrected for using ground - layer adaptive optics ( glao ) techniques ( e.g. chun 2003 ) or post - processing wavelet decomposition methods ( e.g. puech et al .",
    "2004 , flores et al .",
    "2004 ) instead of a conventional adaptive optics system .",
    "one particularly useful observation for which ao correction will be essential is the targeted observation of agn with integral field spectrographs . in many sources",
    "the central agn often outshines its host galaxy , which may be extremely difficult to study if the agn emission is blurred over its host in an atmospheric seeing halo . with ao correction",
    "however , the agn emission may be concentrated more fully in its psf core , decreasing the contamination in the seeing halo and possibly enabling an ifs to probe the emission from , and kinematics of , the host galaxy .",
    "we have outlined an observing strategy for infrared integral - field spectroscopy of high - redshift galaxies , and presented a formalism for simulating observations with an arbitrary telescope plus lenslet spectrograph system .",
    "these calculations may be generalized to predict the integration times required to observe extended or compact sources both at high redshift and in the local universe .",
    "we have determined 5@xmath0 limiting line flux densities as a function of wavelength for typical ao - equipped integral - field spectrographs mounted on telescopes with primary mirror diameters ranging from 5 to 50 meters . using 100 mas angular sampling , these limiting flux densities are typically @xmath123 erg s@xmath30 @xmath33 arcsec@xmath35 for 10-m class telescopes , and @xmath124 erg s@xmath30 @xmath33 arcsec@xmath35 for 50-m class telescopes .",
    "these limiting line fluxes increase by a factor of @xmath4 3 for each factor of @xmath4 2 that the angular lenslet scale is decreased .",
    "realistic models of the infrared background flux are taken into account in these calculations , and include blackbody emission from both the atmosphere and telescope optics and atmospheric oh line emission .",
    "warm adaptive optics systems contribute significantly to the @xmath10-band background flux , and cryogenic cooling to @xmath125 k may reduce the effective background by as much as a factor of ten .",
    "using parameters characteristic of the keck / osiris spectrograph we have predicted s / n ratios for detection of line emission from star - forming regions at redshifts @xmath72 with angular lenslet scales of 20 , 35 , 50 , and 100 mas , and find that osiris can observe h@xmath43 emission from regions forming stars at a rate of about 1 @xmath94 yr@xmath30 per 100 mas angular grid square with a signal - to - noise ratio s / n @xmath126",
    ". simulated integral - field spectroscopy of @xmath3 star - forming galaxies in the goods - n field indicates that osiris can observe h@xmath43 emission from these sources with an angular resolution of 100 mas ( @xmath4 1 kiloparsec at redshift @xmath5 ) and signal - to - noise ratios between 3 and 20 , and will be able to produce two - dimensional velocity maps for these galaxies relative to the systemic redshift .",
    "these simulated velocity maps suggest that osiris will be able to distinguish between some disparate kinematic models permitted by ambiguous long - slit spectroscopic data alone , and may distinguish between mature disk kinematics and active mergers for spatially extended , bright galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "further observational constraints on the h@xmath43 morphologies of the @xmath3 galaxies from ao - corrected narrow - band photometry will help determine whether sources may resolve into individual star forming regions on scales less than a kiloparsec , permitting more detailed simulations and kinematic studies .",
