    "next , the reasons for the modifications to the k - s equation are discussed in more detail in section [ s : mod_ks ] .",
    "thirdly , a brief summary of the lss method will be given in section [ s : lss ] , followed by a presentation and a discussion of the gradients computed using lss in section [ s : results ] .",
    "section [ s : conclusion ] offers some concluding remarks and a discussion of future work .",
    "the modified k - s equation was discretized with a 2nd order finite difference scheme .",
    "we number the nodes @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the boundary nodes and @xmath10 denote the interior nodes .",
    "define @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spacing between each node , and @xmath13 .",
    "the terms of the modified k - s equation were approximated as follows on the interior nodes :    @xmath14    to enforce the homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions we set @xmath15 . to enforce the homogeneous neumann boundary conditions , we make use of ghost nodes , setting @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this ensures that the central difference approximation of @xmath18 is zero at nodes @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which correspond to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "therefore :    @xmath23     +    the coarsest mesh we used to solve the modified k - s equation is a uniform mesh with 127 interior nodes , as in brummitt and sprott @xcite . from figure",
    "[ f : obj_vs_c ] , we can see that while this mesh is accurate for @xmath24 , where the mean values of @xmath3 never vary more than 5% . however .",
    "the approximation is poor for larger magnitude values of @xmath2 and for computing @xmath4 .",
    "a mesh with @xmath25 interior nodes and @xmath26 is used for these computations , as this grid resolution appears to offer sufficient accuracy in figure [ f : obj_vs_c ] .",
    "time integration was mainly conducted with a 3rd order accurate implicit - explicit runge - kutta time integration scheme , imexrk34s[2r]l@xmath27 @xcite , with the butcher tableau shown in table [ t : imex ] .",
    "the 2nd and 4th order derivatives in equation were integrated with the diagonally implicit runge - kutta ( dirk ) scheme , and the convective terms , @xmath28 , were integrated with the explicit runge - kutta ( erk ) scheme .",

    "solutions to the modified k - s equation used for the work presented in this paper range from 100 to 4000 time units .    finally ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , the initial condition @xmath31 was formed by randomly selecting numbers at each spatial node from a uniform distribution between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for lss to compute accurate gradients , the system being analyzed must be ergodic ; the long time behavior of the system is independent of initial conditions .",
    "the k - s equation with periodic boundary conditions is not ergodic , and to show this we consider the spatial average of equation :    @xmath34    taking the time derivative outside of the integral , using the notation @xmath35 , and multiplying both sides of the equation by @xmath36 , we obtain :    @xmath37    for periodic boundary conditions , @xmath38 and all of its derivatives are equal at @xmath21 and @xmath22 for all time . therefore equation becomes :    @xmath39    this means that @xmath40 is always equal to the average of the initial condition @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , our choice of the initial condition dictates the long time behavior of our quantity of interest @xmath40 and the system is not ergodic . on the other hand",
    "if homogeneous dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are used , ergodic behavior can shown from numerical solutions .",
    "ergodicity can be observed in the behavior of the ensemble averaged time averaged solution , defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the time average of @xmath43 .",
    "the ensemble average is conducted over @xmath44 realizations , each starting from a different initial condition , comprised of the random noise described in section [ s : numerics ] shifted to some non - zero mean .",
    "figure [ f : ergodicity ] shows that @xmath45 converges to a single function for initial conditions with different means .",
    "the initial condition also contained random noise like that described in section [ s : numerics ] .",
    "the random noise component of the initial condition is comprised of many different functions , which means that the convergence shown in figure [ f : ergodicity ] strongly implies that the system is ergodic .",
    "note that similar convergence of the solutions was observed at a number of different values of @xmath2 , suggesting that the modified k - s equation is ergodic over a wide range of values of @xmath2 .",
    "+    finally , note that the initial condition @xmath46 results in a trivial solution @xmath47 .",
    "however , this trivial solution is unstable ; any small perturbation to it will lead to a non - trivial , chaotic solution @xcite .",
    "one can think of the trivial solution to the modified k - s equation as an unstable fixed point , like @xmath48 in the lorenz system .      to see the effect of the parameter @xmath2 , we again consider ensemble averaged time averaged solutions @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ f : ensemble_c ] shows that as @xmath2 is increased , @xmath45 is decreased at all values of @xmath49 other than the boundaries , where the dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "+    this decrease in @xmath45 occurs because increasing @xmath2 leads to increased linear convection in the positive @xmath49 direction , transporting negative @xmath38 from one side of the domain to the other and transporting positive @xmath38 out of the domain .",
    "this trend can be seen in figure [ f : obj_vs_c ] , which shows how time and space averaged @xmath38 , @xmath3 , varies with @xmath2 . from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , we see the behavior shown in figure [ f : ensemble_c ] and @xmath3 decreases linearly with @xmath2 . note that because the the boundary conditions are symmetric , @xmath3 as a function of @xmath2 is anti - symmetric .",
    "decreasing @xmath2 from @xmath50 results in an linear increase in @xmath3 , until @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) we see a change in the slope of @xmath3 .",
    "another change occurs around @xmath55 .",
    "these changes in the trend of @xmath3 are a result of changes in the dynamics of the modified k - s equation .",
    "example of solutions @xmath43 in these regimes , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are shown in figure [ f : histories ] .     vs. @xmath59 plots for @xmath43 for @xmath60 ( light turbulence dominated regime ) , @xmath61 ( convection dominated regime ) , and @xmath62 ( steady regime ) .",
    "all three histories were computed with @xmath26 .",
    "the initial condition for all three histories was @xmath63 . ]    in the first regime , @xmath56 , the `` light turbulence dominated regime '' , we see the chaotic spatio - temporal structures referred to in many past studies of the k - s . in the left - most plot of figure [ f : histories ] we see that some of the structures between roughly @xmath64 and @xmath65 are convecting towards @xmath66 , due to the linear convection term .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased , convection in the positive @xmath49-direction is increased .",
    "this can be seen visually from the tilt or slope of the spatio - temporal structures in all three @xmath67 diagrams in figure [ f : histories ] .",
    "the smaller the slope of the structure , the faster the structure is being convected .    in the second regime , @xmath57 ,",
    "the `` convection dominated regime '' , all spatio - temporal structures are convecting towards @xmath66 , as seen in the center plot of figure [ f : histories ] .",
    "additionally , a region of @xmath68 now exists near @xmath21 . as @xmath49 increases",
    ", the spatio - temporal structures grow , until @xmath69 for @xmath70 ( figure [ f : histories ] ) .",
    "the size of this region grows as @xmath2 is increased .    in the final regime , @xmath58 , the `` steady regime '' ,",
    "the chaotic structures are convected out of the domain , as in the right - most plot in figure [ f : histories ] .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased , the structures are convected out of the spatial domain faster .",
    "the trivial solution has changed from an unstable fixed point to a stable fixed point , and the solution becomes @xmath47 after some time .",
    "this is different from solutions in the first two regimes , both of which are on chaotic attractors , as indicated by ergodicity and presence of spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "say we are interested in the sensitivity of our long - time averaged quantity @xmath3 to the parameter @xmath2 :    @xmath71    for non - chaotic solutions of the k - s equation solved from the * initial value problem * , we can exchange the derivative and the time limit :    @xmath72    where    @xmath73    we can solve for the _ tangent solution _ , @xmath74 , with the linearization of equation , also called the _ tangent equation_. however , if @xmath75 is chaotic , then equations and do not hold and the tangent solution , @xmath76 . diverges exponentially as the simulation time @xmath77 is increased @xcite .    for a steady or periodic solution ,",
    "a slight change @xmath78 in @xmath2 results in a slightly different solution @xmath79 for all time and the tangent solution , @xmath76 , can be computed accurately .",
    "however , the positive lyapunov exponent(s ) present on strange attractors ensure that the solutions @xmath79 and @xmath75 will be very different after some time , as illustrated in figure [ f : lss_schematic ] .",
    "we see that if the perturbed solution , or phase space trajectory , has the same initial condition as the unperturbed trajectory , the two trajectories diverge exponentially .",
    "this exponential divergence of the two trajectories causes the tangent solution , @xmath76 , to diverge , resulting in the issues with traditional sensitivity analysis mentioned in the introduction .",
    "however , the assumption of ergodicity means that it is not necessary to compare a perturbed and an unperturbed trajectory with the same initial condition if the quantities of interest are statistics of the system such as long time averages .",
    "therefore , an initial condition can be chosen such that the perturbed and unperturbed trajectories do not diverge , resulting in the blue trajectory in figure [ f : lss_schematic ] .",

    "possible reasons for this , and slight error in the sensitivity of @xmath104 are discussed in the next section .",
    "one source of error is the difference between the infinite time shadowing direction and its approximation by lss .",
    "our numerical shadowing direction @xmath108 is just a finite time approximation of the infinitely long shadowing direction @xmath109 .",
    "it has been proven that the errors of this approximation are the greatest at the beginning ( @xmath110 ) and end ( @xmath111 ) of the numerical shadowing direction @xcite .",

    "therefore , @xmath108 most accurately approximates @xmath109 in the middle of the time interval it is computed on @xcite .     for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "note that the spectra for @xmath2 values in the convection dominated regime have two values very close to zero , as opposed to just one .",

    "this is shown to be the case in figure [ f : lyapunov ] .",
    "the low magnitude lyapunov exponents cause the error in @xmath116 for @xmath2 values in the convection dominated regime to decay very slowly as @xmath59 increases from @xmath110 .",
    "this slower convergence can be seen in figure [ f : vbar_hist ] .     versus @xmath59 for @xmath50 and @xmath117 .",
    "each simulation was run for @xmath118 time units before the lss method was applied .",
    "while the mean shadowing direction for @xmath50 converges to a quasi - steady state almost instantly , it takes until around @xmath119 for the @xmath117 shadowing direction to do so .",

    "these longer time - scales require the use of a longer time interval to compute accurate gradients , as a low frequency periodic function would require a longer time interval to compute an accurate average .",
    "the longer time scales observed in @xmath116 in the convection dominated regime arise because of the smaller magnitude lyapunov exponents , whose reciprocals are related to the time scales of @xmath116 .",
    "overall , the convection dominated regime has a smaller magnitude non - zero lyapunov exponent than the smallest non - zero lyapunov exponent in the light turbulence dominated regime .",
    "this can contribute to the fact that the sensitivity computed over the same time interval is less accurate in the convection dominated regime .    however , even when a larger time interval is used , the gradients in the convection dominated regime appear to converge to the wrong value , as shown in figure [ f : grad_vs_c ] .",

    ". therefore , the expression for the derivative in equation is incorrect , as observed in figure [ f : saw_obj_grad ] . in other words , a shadow trajectory with @xmath138 of some reference trajectory with @xmath139",
    "does not necessarily have the same long time averaged quantities as a typical trajectory with @xmath138 .",
    "obtaining different long time averaged quantities from solutions with the same values of @xmath129 ( or @xmath2 for the k - s equation ) contradicts the assumption of ergodicity .",
    "it can be shown that lss will compute correct gradients if the long time averaged quantities are the same for all initial conditions @xcite .",
    "however , in practice long time averaged quantities are only the same for _ almost all _ initial conditions .",
    "for example , the long time averaged quantities of the k - s equation are all zero for the initial condition @xmath140 when @xmath141 , which is different from the values in figure [ f : obj_vs_c ] .",
    "also , if we consider a trajectory of the sawtooth map starting at @xmath142 will stay at @xmath142 for all iterations , resulting in @xmath143 , regardless of the value of @xmath129 , in contrast to the trend shown in figure [ f : saw_obj_grad ] .",
    "both the k - s equation and the sawtooth map are not strongly ergodic .",
    "that is , the same long time averaged quantities are obtained for _ almost all _ , not _ all _ initial conditions , so computation of the correct gradient is not guaranteed .",
    "it is important to emphasize that lss has been used to compute very accurate gradients for a number of smaller systems , including the lorenz system @xcite , and that it computes fairly accurate gradients for the k - s equation when @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , it seems that this breakdown in lss occurs in largely varying degrees .",
    "further work needs to be done to determine what specific properties of the sawtooth map cause this issue to occur .",
    "in conclusion , the lss method computes accurate gradients for a wide range of system parameter values for a modified k - s equation .",
    "in particular , it was found that lss worked very well in the light turbulence dominated regime , especially for the quantity of interest @xmath4 .",
    "however , the method slightly over - predicted the magnitude of gradients of the quantity @xmath3 in the light turbulence regime and falsely predicted all sensitivities in the convection dominated regime . this breakdown in the method",
    "is also observed for smaller systems , such as the sawtooth map .",
    "it appears that while lss works very well for some systems , including the lorenz system and the k - s equation for certain values of @xmath2 , it does not work very well or at all for other systems .",
    "future work needs to be done to determine what properties of the sawtooth map and others like it cause lss to break down .",
    "the lessons learned from working with the sawtooth map can potentially be applied to making lss more robust and learning what classes of pdes and larger systems lss is best suited for .",
