    "an atom laser , which is a bright , directed and coherent beam of atoms , is quite similar to an optical laser .",
    "as the development of optical lasers has revolutionized the field of light optics , atom lasers have the potential to revolutionize the field of atom optics .",
    "one of the applications of the atom laser is precision measurement due to the potential high sensitivity .",
    "for example , the sensitivity may be orders higher in a matter wave gyroscope than that in a photon gyroscope @xcite .",
    "in addition , pulsed atom lasers have been used as the mater wave interferometer @xcite and the detector to study the characters of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite . because of these applications , to study the fluctuations of the pulsed atom laser becomes important , which is the first step to get rid of or avoid the fluctuations .",
    "recent studies do show that the fluctuations are large under certain conditions .",
    "the fluctuations due to the coupling back of output beams in the rf coupled atom laser system are reported @xcite .",
    "the strong strength of output coupling leads to fluctuations even shut down of the laser @xcite .",
    "the differences between two - state and multistate atom laser are studied , and the sloshing of the middle state atoms induce noise of continuously out - coupled atom laser @xcite .",
    "recently , many works @xcite on spinor bec appeared .",
    "the complex structure of internal states is a condition that enable the spinor bec system to reveal rich dynamics .",
    "similarly , the @xmath2 system , a five - state system , is expected to provide interesting and rich dynamics during the output of the atom laser .    in this paper",
    ", we study the various fluctuations at low coupling rate where the back coupling induced fluctuations @xcite are avoided .",
    "compared with the previous works , we find the following interesting results : ( 1 ) under the condition that the back - coupling induced fluctuations can be neglected , the resolvable picture in the experiment demonstrates large fluctuations .",
    "( 2 ) with the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations , we demonstrate two new reasons leading to fluctuations : the atom loss of the condensate due to the output of atom laser and the interference of the output atom clouds . ( 3 ) our results show that the fluctuations of the atom laser in the @xmath0=2 manifold of @xmath1 atoms do not decrease with the coupling strength , which is different from the continuously coupled atom laser .",
    "the experimental setup is the same as that described in our previous work @xcite . in brief , we get samples of condensates in a compact low power quadrupole - ioffe - configuration ( quic ) trap with trapping frequency @xmath3 hz radially and @xmath4 hz axially .",
    "the current is 20.7 a in quadrupole coils and 20.5 a in ioffe coil . typically , a @xmath1 condensate with @xmath5 atoms in @xmath6 , @xmath7 state is formed after the evaporative cooling . then the rf pulses are switched on to couple the atoms .",
    "the images are taken right after switching off the magnetic trap .",
    "1 shows the image of atom laser after 4 rf pulses .",
    "the time separations are @xmath8 ms between the first and second pulse , @xmath9 ms between the second and the third pulse , @xmath10 ms between the third pulse and the fourth pulse and @xmath11 ms between the fourth pulse and the imaging .",
    "the back - coupling induced noise @xcite can be neglected because of the large enough time separations .",
    "the rf pulse duration is 24 @xmath12 , and the coupling strength is @xmath13 hz . the frequency of the rf is set to be resonant with the center of the condensate . in fig .",
    "1 , the first out - coupled pulse is a single could of atoms as we expect .",
    "however , the second one is composed of two clouds . the third and",
    "the fourth one look more complex .",
    "the fluctuations appear because the @xmath14 state ( trapped state ) is populated after the first rf pulse .",
    "then the following atom laser pulses come from both the @xmath15 and @xmath14 state .",
    "this has been predicted in @xcite theoretically .",
    "however , it has not been observed experimentally .",
    "to investigate the forming process of atom laser beams , the one - dimensional gp equations @xcite are used to study the dynamics of the coupling process , which are given by @xmath16    here @xmath17 is the gravity , where @xmath18 is the radial trapping frequency of the @xmath19=1 state .",
    "@xmath20 is the interaction coefficient , where @xmath21 is the effective interaction strength .",
    "@xmath22 is the detuning of rf field from the resonance of atoms at the center of the magnetic trap .",
    "the time , spatial coordinates , wave function and detuning are measured in the units of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the large velocities of atoms due to the falling down in gravitational potential make the numerical descriptions complex @xcite .",
    "the small de broglie wavelengths due to the large velocities require very fine temporal and spatial grids to ensure the validity of numerical simulation .",
    "we use the 1d gp equations to simplify the numerics and the time - splitting sine - spectral ( tssp ) method @xcite preformed by fortran to speed up the simulation .",
    "2 shows the experimental data of the 1d density and the numerical fitting .",
    "picture ( a),(b),(c ) and ( d ) correspond to the first , second , third and fourth pulse at @xmath26 ms , respectively .",
    "in fact , it appears that there is more information in the numerical simulation results since the resolution of absorption image is limited to several @xmath27 typically .",
    "we use the gp equations to study the fluctuations in the following , which removes the limitation of the image resolution .",
    "the forming process of the atom beams without the back - coupling is shown in fig . 3 by numerically solving the 1d gp equations .",
    "although the process with back - coupling has been discussed in @xcite , we provide the analysis to better understand the following discussions .",
    "the parameters are the same as that in experiments . in the first column",
    ", we can see the emergence of @xmath19=1 component after the first rf pulse . because the equilibrium position of the @xmath19=1 state is a bit lower than that of the @xmath19=2 state ,",
    "the new @xmath19=1 atoms oscillate around its equilibrium position ( the @xmath19=2 state and @xmath19=1 state atoms separate in space ) .",
    "when the second rf pulse is switched on , both the @xmath19=2 state and the @xmath19=1 state are coupled into the @xmath19=0 state , which induces that the second atom laser pulse is composed of two clouds of atoms .",
    "note that there are two clouds atoms in both @xmath19=2 component and @xmath19=1 component after the second pulse .",
    "this induces that the third atom laser pulse is composed of 4 pulses in column 4 ( two of the clouds overlap ) .",
    "so the nth output atom laser pulse is composed of @xmath28 atom clouds in principle , which means that the fluctuations increase very fast with coupling times . in this process , the existence of the @xmath19=1 state creates the fluctuations , and the population transfer between the @xmath19=2 state and the @xmath19=1 state aggravates the fluctuations quickly .    using the gp equations , the fluctuations with different coupling strength",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "4 . the fluctuations keep large as the decreasing of the coupling strength .",
    "the shape of the density distribution trends to be fixed ( fig .",
    "4 ( c ) and fig . 4 ( d ) ) at very low coupling strength .",
    "this is different from the continuously coupled atom laser . for continuously coupled atom laser ,",
    "experiments demonstrate that quite stable flux can be formed if the coupling strength is low @xcite , and numerical simulations also show that the fluctuations decrease with the coupling strength @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the difference of the spatial resonant width of the output coupling .",
    "a 20 @xmath29 rf pulse has a frequency width of 100 khz corresponding to 20 @xmath27 spatial width of resonance .",
    "the @xmath14 component , which originated from the @xmath15 state , can not escape from this large resonant region before next rf pulse .",
    "so the @xmath30 component , which is originated from the mf=1 component , becomes the fluctuations of the output laser pulse .",
    "the fluctuations occur whether the coupling strength is high or low . in continuously coupling case , a 10 ms rf pulse has a frequency width of 200 hz corresponding to 0.2 @xmath27 spatial width of resonance .",
    "the @xmath14 component , which is originated from the @xmath15 state , leaves the resonant region quickly before inducing large fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the 1d gp equations appear to be a useful tool to study the dynamics of atom lasers .",
    "the atoms numbers in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) are estimated to be at least one order less than that in fig . 4 ( a ) so it is hard to study experimentally .",
    "we find that the atom loss of the condensate due to the output of atom laser leads to fluctuations .",
    "5 ( a ) shows the out - coupled atom lasers with different time separation @xmath31 between the first and second pulse .",
    "plotted are the atom laser pulses generated from the condensate ( @xmath19=2 component ) right after the second pulse . from the top to bottom the rows are the time separation @xmath321.90 ms , 2.49 ms , 3.08 ms , 3.67 ms and 4.25 ms respectively . from the left",
    "to right the columns are the coupling strength @xmath3319000 hz , 12000 hz and 2000 hz .",
    "the two rf pulses in each process are with the same strength .",
    "the shape of the generated atom laser changes periodically with the coupling time at high coupling strength .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations decreases with the coupling strength .",
    "the explanation of this phenomenon can be found in fig . 5 ( b ) , where the evolution of the 1d density of the condensate as time after the first pulse is shown .",
    "the rf pulse is fired at @xmath34=0 .",
    "the coupling strength is @xmath3319000 hz , 12000 hz and 2000 hz from left to right , which is the same as that in fig .",
    "5 ( a ) . when a large quantity of atoms are out - coupled from the condensate , the mean - field interaction potential between an atom and the condensate changes .",
    "the condensate does not stay in the original equilibrium any more .",
    "the 1d density shape of the condensate changes periodically with time .",
    "the density shape of the extracted atom laser by the following rf pulse also changes periodically with time because the generated pulse retains the density spread of the condensate in space . when the atom loss is quite few ( the right one of fig .",
    "5 ( b ) ) so that the change of the interaction potential is quite small , the fluctuations of the atom laser can be neglected .",
    "the condensate is not continuously repumped in recent atom laser experiments so this kind of fluctuation is expected to be inherent in all state changing out - coupling , e.g. , rf and raman .",
    "it appears that the interference of out - coupled atom clouds is another new reason leading to large fluctuations .",
    "the atom laser pulse is composed of several atom clouds except the first pulse .",
    "interference occurs when different clouds overlap in space .",
    "6 shows the process that interference appears by solving the 1d gp equations .",
    "the parameters are the same with the experiment . from left to right in fig . 6 ( a ) ,",
    "the first atom cloud is out - coupled from @xmath19=2 state , and the second is from @xmath19=1 state . there is a relative velocity between them .",
    "as they overlap , stripes appear in fig .",
    "then they sufficiently overlap later in fig .",
    "these interference stripes are with high frequency in space , which make them hard to be detected by absorption image , e.g. , in the fig .",
    "2 ( d ) . the fluctuations trend to be larger in later laser pulse in fig .",
    "2 as more clouds in one pulse have more chances to overlap .",
    "in conclusion , we demonstrate that the fluctuations of pulsed atom laser in the @xmath0=2 manifold are still large on condition that the back coupling induced fluctuations are avoided . the obvious fluctuations are experimentally observed . by using the 1d gp equations , we find two new reasons leading to fluctuations :",
    "( 1 ) the atom loss of the condensate leads to fluctuations of the atom laser ; ( 2 ) the interference of out - coupled atom clouds is another reason which induces large fluctuations .",
