    "modern approaches to quantum gravity predict the lorenz invariance violation ( liv thereafter ) manifesting itself in particular as an energy dependent modification of relativistic dispersion relation . essentially , additional terms in dispersion relation follow a power law expansion with respect to @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the particle s ( photon s ) energy and @xmath3 is the quantum gravity energy scale .",
    "the first guess concerning @xmath3 would be to assume it being of order of the planck energy @xmath4 .",
    "although there are suggestions that in some concrete models ( e.g. with large extra dimensions ) @xmath3 could be considerably lower than planck energy , it is clear that departures from standard relativistic dispersion relation can be seen only in high - energy particles or photons .",
    "several years ago it has been proposed to use astrophysical objects to look for energy dependent time of arrival delays @xcite .",
    "specifically gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) being energetic events visible from cosmological distances are the most promising sources of constraining liv theories .",
    "indeed they were already discussed in this context ( quite recently in @xcite ) and even used to obtain some constraints @xcite .",
    "one is facing here a problem that in the energy range typical for gamma ray photons the liv effects are very subtle . on the other hand",
    ", one could imagine looking for tev photons which would be produced by grbs in synchrotron self compton mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , the universe filled with 2.7 k cosmic microwave background radiation becomes opaque , via pair production process , to photons with energies above 10 tev .",
    "this is analogous to gzk threshold for particles . despite",
    "the fact that liv theories are often invoked to resolve the gzk paradox @xcite and that 20 tev photons were reported come from mk 501 bl lac object @xcite the use of very high energy photons from grbs can be tricky .",
    "hopefully in a recent paper jacob and piran proposed to use high energy neutrinos instead of photons @xcite .",
    "emission of @xmath5 neutrinos is typically predicted in current models of grbs @xcite and as noticed in @xcite the forthcoming neutrino detectors like ice cube are extremely quiet in this energy range . measurements of time delay between prompt gamma ray photons and neutrino signal would open a new window on exploring liv theories .",
    "therefore this idea is worth further consideration . in this paper",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of this setting to the details of cosmological model .",
    "the discovery of accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite introduced the problem of `` dark energy '' in the universe which is now one of the most important issues in modern cosmology .",
    "a lot of specific scenarios have been put forward as an explanation of this puzzling phenomenon .",
    "they fall into two broad categories : searching an explanation among hypothetical candidates for dark energy ( cosmological constant @xmath0 @xcite , quintessence - evolving scalar fields @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite ) or modification of gravity theory ( e.g. brane world scenarios @xcite ) .",
    "we will examine the liv induced time delays between prompt photon and neutrino arrivals in the above mentioned five classes of cosmological models .    in the next section we briefly recall phenomenology of distorted dispersion relation in liv theories and its consequences for energy dependent time of arrival delays .",
    "section 2 also briefly outlines cosmological models considered .",
    "note that brane - world scenario is not just a candidate for background cosmology , but also `` represents '' the class of theories in which liv occurs @xcite .",
    "the final section contains results and conclusions .",
    "following @xcite and for better comparison of results we assume the modified dispersion relation for neutrinos from grb sources in the form : @xmath6 where:@xmath7 with @xmath8 corresponding to superluminal and @xmath9 to infraluminal motion , @xmath10 is a dimensionless parameter . in order to get the results comparable with @xcite we assume @xmath3 equal to the planck energy , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) essentially corresponds to the power - law expansion ( see @xcite ) so for the practical purposes ( due to smallness of expansion parameter @xmath1 ) only the lowest terms of the expansion are relevant . because in some liv theories the odd power terms might be forbidden @xcite we retain the cases of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the relation ( [ dispersion ] ) leads to a hamiltonian of the following form @xmath15 because of the expansion of the universe , neutrino momentum @xmath16 is related to the cosmic scale factor @xmath17 through @xmath18 later on the scale factor will be re - expressed in terms of redshift @xmath19 which is observable quantity .",
    "similar relation holds of course for neutrino energy @xmath20.the time dependent velocity is given by @xmath21 from ( [ velocity ] ) , using hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) and scale factor dependence ( [ relation1 ] ) one can easily obtain ( to the lowest order in terms of the observed neutrino energy @xmath22 ) that @xmath23    the comoving distance travelled by neutrino from a grb to the earth is defined as @xmath24 taking into account that @xmath25 we can express the above relation ( [ distance1 ] ) in terms of redshift @xmath19 @xmath26 where for neutrinos we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as usually denotes the expansion rate .",
    "time of flight for neutrinos ( i.e. the comoving distance measured in light years ) from grb source to the earth is then @xmath29 in the first term one easily recognizes the well known time of flight for prompt ( lower energetic ) photons so the time delay due to both , neutrino masses and liv effects , between a high energy neutrino and a low energy prompt photon is equal to @xmath30    in the calculations above we retained the neutrino mass  it is massive after all . for the purpose of further calculations we assume @xmath31 .",
    "however it is evident already from the formula ( [ time delay ] ) that the effect of non - zero mass of the neutrino is for our purpose negligible  in perfect accordance with formulas in @xcite .",
    "the paragraphs below briefly introduce five types of cosmological models in which liv induced time delays will be calculated .",
    "we will restrict our attention to flat models @xmath32 because the flat frw geometry is strongly supported by cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) data @xcite .",
    "friedman - robertson - walker model with non - vanishing cosmological constant and pressure - less matter including the dark part of it responsible for flat rotation curves of galaxies ( the co called @xmath0cdm model ) is a standard reference point in modern cosmology .",
    "sometimes it is referred to as a concordance model since it fits rather well to independent data ( such like cmbr data , lss considerations , supernovae data ) .",
    "the cosmological constant suffers from the fine tuning problem ( being constant , why does it start dominating at the present epoch ? ) and from the enormous discrepancy between facts and expectations ( assuming that @xmath0 represents quantum - mechanical energy of the vacuum it should be 55 orders of magnitude larger than observed @xcite ) .    hence another popular explanation of the accelerating universe is to assume the existence of a negative pressure component called dark energy .",
    "one can heuristically assume that this component is described by hydrodynamical energy - momentum tensor with ( effective ) cosmic equation of state : @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "in such case this component is called `` quintessence '' .",
    "confrontation with supernovae and cmbr data @xcite led to the constraint @xmath35 .",
    "this was further improved by combined analysis of snia and large scale structure considerations ( see e.g. @xcite ) and from wmap data on cmbr @xcite .",
    "the most recent one comes from the ongoing essence supernova survey @xcite and pins down the equation of state parameter @xmath36 to the range @xmath37 . for the illustrative purposes we chose @xmath38 as representing a quintessence model which is different from cosmological constant and still admissible by the data .",
    "if we think that the quintessence has its origins in the evolving scalar field , it would be natural to expect that @xmath36 coefficient should vary in time , i.e. @xmath39 an arbitrary function @xmath40 can be taylor expanded .",
    "then , bearing in mind that both snia surveys or strong gravitational lensing systems are able to probe the range of small and moderate redshifts it is sufficient to explore first the linear order of this expansion .",
    "such possibility , i.e. @xmath41 has been considered in the literature ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". fits to supernovae data performed in the literature suggest @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite ( which is consistent with fits given in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we adapted these values as representative for this parametrization of the equation of state .    in the class of generalized chaplygin gas models",
    "matter content of the universe consists of pressure - less gas with energy density @xmath44 representing baryonic plus cold dark matter ( cdm ) and of the generalized chaplygin gas with the equation of state @xmath45 with @xmath46 , representing dark energy responsible for acceleration of the universe . using the angular size statistics for extragalactic sources combined with snia data it was found in @xcite that in the the @xmath47 and @xmath48 scenario best fitted values of model parameters are @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "generalized chaplygin gas models have been intensively studied in the literature @xcite and in particular they have been tested against supernovae data ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "conclusions from these fits are in agreement with the above mentioned values of parameters so we used them as representative of chaplygin gas models .",
    "brane - world scenarios assume that our four - dimensional spacetime is embedded into 5-dimensional space and gravity in 5-dimensions is governed by the usual 5-dimensional einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the bulk metric induces a 4-dimensional metric on the brane .",
    "the brane induced gravity models @xcite have a 4-dimensional einstein - hilbert action on the brane calculated with induced metric . according to this picture ,",
    "our 4-dimensional universe is a surface ( a brane ) embedded into a higher dimensional bulk space - time in which gravity propagates . as a consequence there exists a certain cross - over scale @xmath51 above which an observer will detect higher dimensional effects .",
    "cosmological models in brane - world scenarios have been widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that flat brane - world universe with @xmath52 and @xmath53 is consistent with current snia and cmbr data .",
    "note that in flat ( i.e. @xmath54 ) brane - world universe the following relation is valid : @xmath55 .",
    "futher research performed in @xcite based on snls combined with sdss disfavored flat brane - world models . more recent analysis by the same authors @xcite using also essence supernovae sample and cmb acoustic peaks lead to the conclusion that flat brane - world scenario is only slightly disfavored , although inclusion of baryon acoustic oscillation peak would ruled it out . despite this interesting debate",
    "we use flat brane - world scenario with @xmath52 for illustration .",
    "expansion rates @xmath56 ( equivalent to friedman equation ) for the models studied are shown in table 1 .",
    "we have calculated time delays of @xmath57 neutrinos as a function of redshift ( see equation ( [ time delay ] ) ) in different dark energy scenarios described above and for liv theories with @xmath13 , @xmath58 and @xmath14 , @xmath59 respectively .",
    "they are summarized in figure 1 .",
    "redshift range from @xmath60 to @xmath61 represents the depth of grb surveys @xcite and hence reflects the range of distances from which one might expect the high energy neutrinos to come . for better resolution we displayed the same information in figure 2 but in a restricted range of redshifts .",
    "grb sample with measured redshifts has a mode at about @xmath62 .",
    "therefore a range from @xmath63 to @xmath64 in some sense also represents the most likely distance from a potential source of high energy neutrinos .",
    "figure 3 , at last , displays the energy dependence of time of flight delay for the source located at @xmath64 .",
    "one can see noticeable differences between time delays calculated for different background cosmologies .",
    "@xmath0cdm model and quintessence model ( with @xmath36 parameter best fitted to current snia and cmbr data ) introduce negligible confusion to time delays .",
    "brane world models ( i.e. the class representative of theories in which liv is expected ) and chaplygin gas scenario predict time delays considerably lower than in @xmath0cdm cosmology",
    ". for example the differences in time delays of @xmath65 neutrino from a source at @xmath64 between @xmath0cdm and chaplygin gas model is almost 3 hours for @xmath14 liv theories and 43 minutes for @xmath13 liv theories .",
    "respective differences between @xmath0cdm and brane world models is almost 1 hour for @xmath14 and 16 minutes for @xmath13 .",
    "these systematic differences get higher with redshift .",
    "the most pronounced is the difference in time delays between @xmath0cdm and var quintessence ( i.e. the model with linear @xmath40 functions with parameters best fitted to snia ) .",
    "the resulting mismatch between predicted time delays ( from a source at @xmath64 ) ranges from 1.25 hour in @xmath13 theories to 6 hours in @xmath14 liv theories .",
    "respective values for more distant source ( at @xmath61 ) are almost 4 hours ( @xmath13 ) and 27.5 hours .",
    "our results indicate that our ignorance concerning true model of dark energy in the universe is not able to spoil the utility of time delays in discriminating between @xmath13 and @xmath14 classes of liv theories .",
    "however in each class of liv theories it introduces an uncertainty at the level from 7% ( @xmath0cdm , quintessence , chaplygin , braneworld ) up to 35% ( var quintessence ) for sources at @xmath64 ( i.e. the most likely located grbs ) .",
    "this translates into ranges 7%  35% and 14%  70% uncertainty for inferred bounds on @xmath66 in @xmath13 and @xmath14 cases respectively . for more distant sources",
    "this is respectively higher .",
    "therefore the conclusion is that better understanding of dark energy dominated universe is crucial for testing liv theories with cosmological sources like grbs .",
    "theoretically one may also invert this argument by saying that if liv dispersion relation was proven experimentally and its parameters were constrained then time delays from grbs could become a new kind of cosmological test .",
    ".expansion rates @xmath28 in four models tested .",
