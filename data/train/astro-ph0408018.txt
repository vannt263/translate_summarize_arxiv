    "quasi - periodic x - ray brightness oscillations ( so - called qpos ) have been observed in some low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) including neutron stars ( nss ) and black hole candidates ( bhcs ) .",
    "after the discovery of millisecond qpos ( so - called khz qpos ) in nss , the study of khz qpos have been paid more attention .",
    "since their peak frequencies are close to the orbital frequency at the innermost circular orbit ( isco ) around nss , the structures of both the disk and the magnetosphere close to nss can be obtained by studying their origin ( see van der klis 1999 for a review ) .    in almost all khz qpos",
    ", the power spectrum density ( psd ) shows twin peaks whose frequencies are correlated with their x - ray intensity and their peak separation are almost constant ( e.g. , strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; wijnands et al . 1997 ; ford et al .",
    "1997 ; zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) . in some nss ,",
    "a frequency separation of the twin peaks is comparable to a frequency of a third qpo , which is detected during type i x - ray bursts .",
    "since the third qpo is inferred to as a spin frequency of nss , the excitation of twin qpos are conventionally explained by the beat - frequency modulation between the keplerian frequency of the disks and the spin frequency of the nss ( so - called beat - frequency model : see van der klis 2000 for a review ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the beat - frequency model , the peak separations of some khz qpos are not constant ( e.g. sco x-1 : van der klis 1997 , 4u 1608 - 52 : mndez et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "qpos are also found in several bhcs ( e.g. , for grs 1915 + 105 : morgan , remillard , and greiner 1997 , for xte j1550 - 564 : remilard et al .",
    "1999a , for gro j1655 - 40 : remillard et al .",
    "the psd of qpos in bhcs shows single peak and its frequency is relatively stable . in this",
    "regards , qpos in nss and bhcs have been thought to have different origins .",
    "however , the recent discoveries of twin peak qpos in bhcs ( e.g. remillard et al .",
    "2002 ) have cast some doubt on the distinction of qpos in nss and bhcs .",
    "since the ratio of two peak frequencies is about 2:3 in both bhcs and nss , the origin of twin qpos may be identical to the accretion disk .",
    "interpretations of qpos in the context of disk oscillations have been developed by many authors ( e.g. , trapped disk oscillations : kato  & fukue 1980 ; okazaki , kato ,  & fukue 1987 ; nowak  & wagoner 1991 , 1992 , resonances of disk oscillations : abramowicz  & kluziak 2001 ; kato 2003 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "these works investigate a growth of unstable oscillation modes in geometrically thin disks around bhs in order to produce a large fluctuations of x - ray intensity ( see kato 2001 for a review ) .",
    "the first hydrodynamic simulations in the context of disk oscillations were carried out by matsumoto et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1989 ; see kato , fukue ,  & mineshige 1998 for a review ) .",
    "they showed that acoustic oscillations are trapped in the innermost region of the relativistic disk , when a viscosity parameter @xmath6 ( shakura  & sunyaev 1973 ) is large , typically @xmath7 . as a result , a quasi - periodic oscillation with the maximum of epicyclic frequency is established in that region .",
    "later , many hydrodynamic simulations were published ( e.g. , for non - isothermal disks : honma , matsumoto ,  & kato 1992 ; chen  & taam 1995 , for two - dimensional non - adiabatic disks : milsom  & taam 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "although these studies successfully demonstrated the excitation of a trapped oscillation in the disk , the resonant oscillations have a bit advantage to explain 2:3 twin qpos .    in the framework of the resonant oscillations in relativistic disks , abramowicz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) investigated the geodesic motion of particles around bhs .",
    "later , kato ( 2003 ) extended their idea into the disk fluid .",
    "they concluded that twin peak qpos are excited by the resonance of the disk oscillations .",
    "they also asserted that the resonant disk oscillation model can determine the mass and the spin parameter of bhs by using the peak frequencies of twin qpos ( see also abramowicz  & kluziak 2001 ) .",
    "the study of the resonant oscillations in the disk have many precedents .",
    "periodic brightness variations in dwarf nova were investigated in the context of the tidal instability as a result of the resonance in the disk ( e.g. , whitehurst 1988 ; hirose  & osaki 1990 ; lubow 1991a ) .",
    "hirose , osaki , and mineshige ( 1991 ) demonstrated the tidal deformation of the disk as a result of the resonance in the disk by using the three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations ( see also lubow 1991b ) .",
    "the previous simulations of disk oscillation assumed the @xmath6-viscosity model .",
    "however , the mhd turbulence is now widely accepted to be the source of disk viscosity since the maxwell stress coupled with the magnetorotational instability ( mri : balbus  & hawley 1991 ) can effectively transport angular momentum of the disk ( e.g. , stone  & pringle 2001 ; hawley , balbus ,  & stone 2001 ; sano et al .",
    "therefore the dynamics of the accretion flow is controlled by mhd turbulence and the @xmath6-viscosity calculations may fail to represent the numerous aspects of the disk oscillations ( see ogilvie 2003 ) .",
    "although many mhd disk simulations have been carried out so far ( e.g. , hawley 2000 ; machida , hayashi ,  & matsumoto 2000 ; hawley  & krolik 2001 ; hawley , balbus ,  & stone 2001 ; armitage  & reynolds 2003 ; machida  & matsumoto 2003 ) , the numerical study of mhd disk oscillations has not been worked out yet . in the present study",
    ", we perform three - dimensional mhd simulations of a weakly magnetized rotating torus with the same initial condition as that of kato , mineshige ,  & shibata ( 2004 , hereafter referred to as kms04 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to examine the disk oscillations in mhd accretion flows plunging into bhs . to elucidate mhd disk oscillations",

    ", we carry out the calculations until @xmath37 } = 3.2~\\hbox{[$(m/10m_{\\odot})$ sec]}$ ] which correspond to more than @xmath38 orbital time at the isco around @xmath19 bh .",

    "the amplitude of both radial and vertical mass fluxes seems to be increased after @xmath43 .",
    "we can divide the entire evolution of the mhd flows in the following two part : early phase @xmath44 and late phase @xmath45 .",

    "in addition , the flow structure is changed at the radii where the oscillations are excited .",
    "our results indicate that these twin qpos are most likely to be produced by the resonance between the keplerian frequency and the epicyclic frequency .",
    "kato ( 2004b ) investigated that the excitation of the disk oscillations by warps at the resonant radii @xmath101 in the case of schwarzschild metric .",
    "he reported that the resonant oscillation is excited at the radius @xmath102 , on the other hand , it is dumped at the radius @xmath103 .",
    "he predicted that the twin qpos is the resonant oscillations at the radius @xmath104 where @xmath105 and their peak frequencies are equivalent to @xmath1 and @xmath106 at this radius ( see also abramowicz et al .",
    "2003 ; rebusco 2004 ) .",
    "our numerical study in the pseudo - newtonian potential has a good agreement with his results .",
    "in fact , the flow structure is changed at these resonant radii ( see figure  [ fig1:eps ] ) .",
    "we have a similar empirical relation of the peak frequencies of twin qpos ( see equations  [ uqpo : eqn ] and [ lqpo : eqn ] ) and the ratio of lower and upper peak frequencies is close to 2:3 .",
    "in addition , the twin qpo at @xmath85 is dumped in late phase , while that at @xmath94 is persisted for the entire calculation time ( see figure  [ fig3:eps ] ) .    in the present calculation ,",
    "the peak frequencies of twin qpos are slightly different from that in the resonant disk oscillation model .",
    "the deviation of their peak frequency ratio from @xmath107 may be as a result of the pseudo - newtonian approximation since the maximum epicyclic frequency is larger than that in the schwarzschild metric by about a factor of @xmath108 ( e.g. , okazaki , kato , & fukue 1987 ) .",
    "for this reason , we expect that the peak frequency ratio is identical to @xmath107 in general relativistic mhd calculations by using the schwarzschild metric",
    ". further numerical investigation of the detailed internal disk structure of the mhd flows , such as fluctuations of maxwell stresses and magnetic reconnections would help clarify such discrepancies .",
    "moreover , to elucidate the nature of several peaks in the integrated psd of our study [ see figure  [ fig3:eps ]  ( c ) ] , detailed mode analysis in the magnetized disk is also important .",
    "the method described in this paper may provide a basis for investigating the excitation mechanism of the disk oscillations in the mhd flows .",
    "we can estimate masses of the non - rotating bhs by using the relation of peak frequencies in the persistent twin qpos [ see equations  ( [ plqpo : eqn ] ) and ( [ puqpo : eqn ] ) ] as @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) and @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) is the observed lower ( upper ) peak frequency and the mass of bhs estimated by using the lower ( upper ) qpo , respectively .",
    "the estimated masses of bhs in two microquasars ( see remillard et al .",
    "2002 ) are shown in table  [ mass : tab ] . since our calculation in the pseudo - newtonian potential overestimates both the epicyclic frequency and the upper peak frequency , equation ( 17 ) indicates that @xmath114 should be larger than @xmath113 .",
    "in addition , the difference between @xmath113 and @xmath114 is important to discriminate the spin of those bhs . in the case of the rotating bhs",
    ", we expect that the estimated masses of bhs should be larger than @xmath113 and they may be converged at a unique value .",
    "interestingly , the mhd flow structure is changed at these resonant radii ( see figure  [ fig1:eps ] ) .",
    "hawley  & krolik ( 2001 ) also found a similar flow pattern at @xmath115 ( see figure  9 in hawley  & krolik 2001 ) .",
    "although they reported no evidence of qpos in their psd of the mass accretion rate at isco , we could find the persistent twin qpos .",
    "this is because our method has an advantage to evaluate where qpos are excited and what frequency they have simultaneously .",
    "we also find that the radial oscillations are distributed in the region between the radius of the maximum epicyclic frequency and that of the inner boundary .",
    "although this indicates that the radial oscillations are trapped in that region , we can find no strong oscillations with the maximum epicyclic frequency as reported by the previous studies ( e.g. , matsumoto et al .",

    "1992 ) .    in comparison with the hydrodynamic study",
    ", we compute an effective viscosity parameter @xmath116 where @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) and @xmath119 is the radial ( toroidal ) component of the magnetic field and the gas pressure . since time - averaged @xmath120 in that region , the viscous pulsational instability may be marginally stable in the mhd flows ( see kato , honma ,  & matsumoto 1988a , 1988b )    the power - law relations in the psd of the present study ( see figure  [ fig3:eps ] ) is very similar to that of the aperiodic x - ray fluctuations with @xmath121-like psd ( where @xmath54 is a frequency ) in some bhcs .",
    "takeuchi et al . ( 1995 ) constructed an accretion disk model based on a cellular automaton model ( e.g. , mineshige et al .",
    "1994 ) and successfully reproduced similar profiles of observed psd .",
    "they asserted that the sporadic magnetic flares in the accretion disks may be responsible to produce avalanche mass accretions in order to satisfy their assumption of critical behavior .",

    "( 2000 ) showed that the time fluctuations of the joule heating term in the 3-d mhd simulation of machida et al .",
    "( 2000 ) produced a similar power - law profile .",
    "however , a direct connection between the magnetic flares and the mass accretions has not been cleared yet .",
    "since the variability of mass fluxes in our calculation may depends on the magnetic stress induced locally in the disk , these may reflect the spontaneous evolution of the mhd turbulence . to elucidate their connection ,",
    "we need more careful studies .",
    "the present paper assumes that the emissivity at various regions in the disk is related to the gravitational energy dissipated by the fluctuation of the mass fluxes .",

    "<S> we study the radial and vertical oscillations in the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) accretion flows around black holes . </S>",
    "<S> general relativistic effects are taken into account by using pseudo - newtonian potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the structure of mhd flows is changed at @xmath0 and the two pairs of quasi - periodic oscillations ( twin qpos ) are excited in that region . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the power spectrum density ( psd ) indicates that these twin qpos are most likely to be produced by the resonance between the keplerian frequency @xmath1 and the epicyclic frequency @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the psd shows that the lower peak frequency @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath1 , while the upper peak frequency @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of two peak frequencies is close to 2:3 . </S>",
    "<S> the results provide the first direct evidence for the excitation of the resonant disk oscillation in the mhd accretion flows . </S>"
