    "online social networks ( osns ) have become ubiquitous platforms that provide various ways for users to interact over the internet , such as tweeting tweets , sharing links , messaging friends , commenting on posts , and mentioning / replying to other users ( i.e. , @someone ) .",
    "when intense user interactions take place in a short time period , there will be a surge in the volume of user activities in an osn .",
    "such a surge of user activity , which we call a _ burst _ in this work , usually relates to emergent events that are occurring or about to occur in the real world .",
    "for example , michael jackson s death on june 25 , 2009 triggered a global outpouring of grief on twitter  @xcite , and the event even crashed twitter for several minutes  @xcite .",
    "in addition to bursts caused by real world events , some bursts arising from osns can also cause enormous social impact in the real world .",
    "for example , the 2011 england riots , in which people used osns to organize , resulted in @xmath0 crimes across london due to this disorder  @xcite .",
    "hence , detecting bursts in osns is an important task , both for osn managers to monitor the operation status of an osn , and for government agencies to anticipate any emergent social disorder .",
    "typically , there are two types of user interactions in osns .",
    "first is the interaction between users ( we refer to this as _ user - user interaction _ ) , e.g. , a user sends a message to another user , while the second is the interaction between a user and a media content piece ( we refer to this as _ user - content interaction _ ) , e.g. , a user posts a video link .",
    "examples of bursts caused by these two types of interactions include , many greetings being sent / received among people on christmas day , and videos suddenly becoming viral after one day of sharing in an osn . at first sight ,",
    "detecting such bursts in an osn is not difficult .",
    "for example , a straightforward way to detect bursts caused by user - user interactions is to _ count _ the number of pairwise user interactions within a time window , and report a burst if the volume lies above a given threshold .",
    "however , this method is vulnerable to spamming social - bot attacks  @xcite , which can suddenly generate a huge amount of spamming interactions in the osn .",
    "hence , this method can result in many _",
    "false alarms _ due to the existence of social bots . similar problem also exist when detecting bursts caused by user - content interactions .",
    "many previous works on burst detection are based on idealistic assumptions  @xcite and simply ignore the existence of social bots .",
    "* present work . *",
    "the primary goal of this work is to leverage a special _ triangle structure _ , which is a feature of humans , to design a robust burst detection method that is immunized against common social - bot attacks .",
    "we first describe the triangle structure shared by both types of user interactions .    * interaction triangles in user - user interactions . *",
    "humans form social networks with larger clustering coefficients than those in random networks  @xcite because social networks exhibit many _ triadic closures _  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the social phenomenon of `` _ friends of my friends are also my friends _ '' .",
    "since user - user interactions usually take place along social links , this property implies that user - user interactions should also exhibit many triadic closures ( which we will verify in experiments ) .",
    "in other words , when a group of users suddenly become active , or we say an _ interaction burst _ occurs , in addition to observing the rise of volume of pairwise interactions , we expect to also observe many interactions among three neighboring users , i.e. , many _ interaction triangles _",
    "form if we consider an edge of an interaction triangle to be a user - user interaction .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : ib1 ] when no interaction burst occurs , while in fig .",
    "[ f : ib2 ] , an interaction burst occurs .",
    "in contrast , activities generated by social bots do not possess many triangles since social bots typically select their targets randomly from an osn  @xcite .",

    "we say that a media content piece becomes _ bursty _ if many users interact with it in a short time period .",
    "there are many reasons why a user interacts with a piece of media content . here",
    ", we are particularly interested in the case where one user _ influences _ another user to interact with the content , a.k.a .",
    "the cascading diffusion  @xcite or word - of - mouth spreading  @xcite .",
    "it is known that many emerging news stories arising from osns are related to this mechanism such as the story about the killing of osama bin laden  @xcite .",
    "we find that a bursty media content piece formed by this mechanism is associated with triangle formations in a network . to illustrate this , consider fig .",
    "[ f : cb1 ] , in which there are five user nodes @xmath1 and four content nodes @xmath2 .",
    "a directed edge between two users means that one follows another , and an undirected edge labeled with a timestamp between a user node and a content node represents an interaction between the user and the content at the labeled time .",
    "we say content node @xmath3 has an _ influence triangle _ if there exist two users @xmath4 such that @xmath5 follows @xmath6 and @xmath5 interacts with @xmath3 _ later _ than @xmath6 does .",
    "in other words , the reason @xmath5 interacts with @xmath3 is due to the influence of @xmath6 on @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ f : cb1 ] , only @xmath7 has an influence triangle , the others have no influence triangle , meaning that the majority of user - content interactions are not due to influence ; while in fig .",
    "[ f : cb2 ] , every content node is part of at least one influence triangle , meaning that many content pieces are spreading in a cascading manner in the osn .",
    "from the perspective of an osn manager who wants to know the operation status of the osn , if the osn suddenly switches to a state similar to fig .",

    "so far , we find a common structure shared by different types of bursts : the emergence of _ interaction bursts _ ( caused by user - user interaction ) and _ cascading bursts _ ( caused by user - content interaction )",
    "are both accompanied with the formation of triangles , i.e. , interaction or influence triangles , in appropriately defined networks .",
    "this finding motivates us to characterize patterns of bursts in an osn by characterizing the triangle statistics of a network , which we called the _ triadic cardinality distribution_.    _ triadic cardinality _ of a node in a network , e.g. , a user node in fig .",
    "[ f : ib1 ] or a content node in fig .",
    "[ f : cb1 ] , is the number of triangles that it belongs to .",
    "the triadic cardinality distribution then characterizes the fractions of nodes with certain triadic cardinalities .",
    "when a burst occurs , because many new interaction / influence triangles are formed , we will observe that some nodes triadic cardinalities increase , and this results in the distribution shifting to right , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ f : ib3 ] and  [ f : cb3 ] .",
    "the triadic cardinality distribution provides succinct summary information to characterize burst patterns of a large scale osn .",
    "hence , by tracking triadic cardinality distributions , we can detect the presence of bursts .    in this paper , we assume that user interactions are aggregated chronologically to form a _ social activity stream _ , which can be considered as an abstraction of a _ tweet stream _ in twitter , or a _ news feed _ in facebook .",
    "we aim to calculate triadic cardinality distributions from this stream",
    ". however , when a network is large or users are very active , the social activity stream will be high speed .",
    "for example , the speed of the twitter s tweets stream can be as high as @xmath8 tweets per second on average , @xmath9 tweets per second during the peak time , and about @xmath10 million to @xmath11 billion tweets are aggregated per day  @xcite . to handle such a high - speed social activity stream",
    ", we design a sample - estimate solution , which provides a _ maximum likelihood estimate _ of the triadic cardinality distribution using sampled data .",
    "our method works in a near - real - time fashion , and is demonstrated to be accurate and efficient .",
    "overall , we make three contributions in this work .    * we propose a useful measure , triadic cardinality distribution , which provides succinct summary information to characterize burst patterns of user interactions in a large scale osn ( section  [ sec : problem ] ) .",
    "* we design a sample - estimate method that is able to accurately and efficiently estimate triadic cardinality distributions from high - speed social activity streams in near - real - time ( sections  [ sec : sampling ] and  [ sec : estimate ] ) . *",
    "extensive experiments conducted on real data demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed triadic cardinality distribution and effectiveness of our sample - estimate solution .",
    "we also show how to apply our method to detect bursts in twitter during the 2014 hong kong occupy central movement ( section  [ sec : experiment ] ) .",
    "we first formally define the notion of social activity stream as mentioned in previous section .",
    "then we define triadic cardinality distribution and describe our proposed solution .",
    "we represent an osn by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a set of users , @xmath14 is a set of relationships among users , and @xmath15 is a set of media content such as hashtags and video links . here",
    ", a relationship between two users can be undirected like the friend relationship in facebook , or directed like the follower relationship in twitter .",
    "users in the osn generate _ social activities _",
    ", e.g. , interact with other users in @xmath13 , or content in @xmath15 .",
    "we denote a social activity by @xmath16 . here",
    "user - user interaction , @xmath17 , corresponds to user @xmath18 interacting with user @xmath19 at time @xmath20 ; and user - content interaction , @xmath21 , corresponds to user @xmath18 interacting with content @xmath3 at time @xmath20 .",
    "these social activities are aggregated chronologically to form a _ social activity stream _ , denoted by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the @xmath24-th social activity in the stream .",
    "triadic cardinality distributions are defined on two _ interaction multi - graphs _ which are formed by user - user and user - content interactions , respectively",
    ".    * interaction multi - graphs . * within a time window ( e.g. , an hour , a day or a week ) , user - user interactions in stream @xmath25 form a multi - graph @xmath26 , where @xmath13 is the original set of users , and @xmath27 is a multi - set consisting of user - user interactions in the window .",
    "the _ triadic cardinality of a user _",

    "the importance of the triadic cardinality distribution lies in its capability of providing succinct summary information to characterize burst patterns in a large scale osn . by tracking triadic cardinality distributions",

    "the advantage of this approach is that it is unnecessary to store all of the samples in the stream , and enables us to detect bursts in a near - real - time fashion .",
    "in this section , we introduce the sampling method in our solution . the purpose of sampling is to reduce the computational cost in handling the massive amount of data in a high - speed social activity stream .",
    "the stream sampling method works as follows .",
    "we toss a biased coin for each social activity @xmath41 .",
    "we keep @xmath5 with probability @xmath42 , and ignore it with probability @xmath43 .",

    "first , we know that an influence triangle consists of two user - content interaction edges in @xmath31 and one social edge in @xmath14 .",

    "this can be done by querying neighbors of one of the two users in the osn .",
    "for example , in twitter , we query _",
    "followees _ of @xmath19 and check whether @xmath19 follows @xmath18 ; or in facebook , we query friends of @xmath19 and check whether @xmath18 is a friend of @xmath19 .",

    "this query cost is obviously expensive when @xmath49 is large . to reduce this query cost , instead of checking every possible user pair",
    ", we check a user pair with probability @xmath55 .",
    "this is equivalent to sampling a social edge in @xmath14 with probability @xmath55 , conditioned on the two associated user - content interactions having been sampled .",

    "the estimation in this section can be viewed as an analog of network flow size distribution estimation  @xcite in which a packet in a flow is viewed to be a triangle of a node . however , in our case , triangle samples are not independent , and a node may have no triangles .",
    "these issues complicate estimation , and we will describe how to solve these issues in this section .    note that we only discuss how to obtain the mle of @xmath71 using @xmath69 , as the mle of @xmath72 using @xmath70 is easily obtained using a similar approach . to estimate @xmath71 , we first consider the easier case where graph size @xmath73 is known .",
    "later , we extend our analysis to the case where @xmath74 is unknown .",

    "we include these in @xmath75 ; the advantage of this inclusion will be seen later .",
    "since we have assumed a total of @xmath76 nodes in @xmath29 , the number of unobserved nodes is @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , we calibrate @xmath75 by @xmath78    our goal is to derive an mle of @xmath71 . to this end , we need to model the sampling process . for a randomly chosen node ,",
    "let @xmath79 denote the number of triangles to which it belongs in @xmath29 , and let @xmath80 denote the number of triangles observed during sampling .",

    "the sampling of a triangle can be viewed as a bernoulli trial with a success probability of @xmath82 , according to theorem  [ th : pd ] .",
    "if bernoulli trials are independent , which means triangles are independently sampled , then @xmath83 follows a binomial distribution .",

    ", we use a public email communication dataset to empirically show how bursts in networks can change the triadic cardinality distribution , and verify our claims previously made .",
    "* enron email dataset . *",
    "the enron email dataset  @xcite includes the entire email communications ( e.g. , who sent an email to whom at what time ) of the enron corporation from its startup to bankruptcy .",
    "the used dataset is carefully cleaned by removing spamming accounts / emails and emails with incorrect timestamps .",
    "the cleaned dataset contains @xmath146 email accounts and @xmath147 email communications between jan 2001 and apr 2002 .",
    "we use this dataset to study patterns of bursts caused by email communications among people , i.e. , by user - user interactions .    * observations from data . * because the data has been cleaned , the number of user - user interactions ( i.e. , number of sent emails recipients , we count it @xmath148 times . ] ) per time window reliably indicates burst occurrences . we show the number of emails sent per week in fig .  [",
    "fig : email_volume ] , and observe at least two bursts that occurred in jun and oct 2001 , respectively .",
    "we also show the number of interaction triangles formed during each week .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient ( pcc ) between the email and triangle volum series is @xmath149 , which reflects a very strong correlation .",
    "the sudden increase ( or decrease ) of email volumes during the two bursts is accompanied with the sudden increase ( or decrease ) of the number of triangles .",
    "thus , this observation verifies our claim that the emergence of a burst is accompanied with the formation of triangles in networks .    ]    * how bursts change triadic cardinality distributions . *",
    "our burst detection method relies on a claim that , when a burst occurs , the triadic cardinality distribution changes . to see this",

    "* impacts of spam . *",
    "as we mentioned earlier , if spam exists , simply using the volume of user interactions to detect bursts will result in false alarms , while the triadic cardinality distribution is a good indicator immune to spam .",
    "to demonstrate this claim , suppose a spammer suddenly becomes active in week 23 , and generates email spams to distort the original triadic cardinality distribution of week 23 .",
    "we consider the following two spamming strategies :    * _ random _ : the spammer randomly chooses many target users to send spam . *",
    "_ random - friend _ : at each step , the spammer randomly chooses a user and a random friend of the user , as two targets ; and sends spams to each of these two targets .",
    "the spammer repeats this step a number of times .    in order to measure the extent that spams can distort the original triadic cardinality distribution of week 23",
    ", we use kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence to measure the difference between the original and distorted distributions . the relationship between kl divergence and the number of injected spams",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kl ] . for both strategies ,",
    "kl divergences both increase as more spams are injected into the interaction network , which is expected .",
    "the random - friend strategy can cause larger divergences than the random strategy , as random - friend strategy is easier to introduce new triangles to the interaction network of week 23 for the reason that two friends are more likely to communicate in a week .",
    "however , even when @xmath150 spams are injected , the spams incur an increasing kl divergence of less than @xmath151 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : distorted ] , we can see that the divergence is indeed small .",
    "( this may be explained by the `` _ center of attention _ ''",
    "phenomenon  @xcite , i.e. , a person may have hundreds of friends but he usually only interacts with a small fraction of them in a time window .",
    "hence , random - friend strategy does not form many triangles . ) therefore , these observations verify that triadic cardinality distribution is robust against common spamming attacks .      in the second experiment , we demonstrate that our proposed estimation methods produce good estimates of triadic cardinality distributions using sampled data while reducing computational cost .",

    "[ fig : est1 ] . for each graph , we set @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively . from these results , we show that when more data is sampled the estimate generally improves , but even when @xmath155 is sufficient to obtain a good estimate .",
    "the sampled triadic cardinality distribution of @xmath69 for @xmath156 is also shown for each graph .",

    "while for the other three graphs , accurate estimates of @xmath120 require relatively large sample rates , and @xmath145 is usually an underestimate of @xmath120 on dblp and pokec due to a slight underestimate of @xmath122 for small values of @xmath38 on the two graphs .",

    "although these models are theoretically interesting , some assumptions made by them are inappropriate , such as the poisson process of message arrivals ( see  @xcite ) and nonexistence of spams / bots , which may limit their practical usage .    the topic of event detection is also related to our work .",
