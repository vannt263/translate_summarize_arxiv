    "one of the most outstanding and basic cosmological questions is how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "currently the favoured scenario assumes that the assemblage of baryonic matter is driven by the evolution of dark matter haloes ( gott & rees  1975 ) .",
    "given the difficulty of observing dark matter , we rely on the luminous counterpart to be a beacon illuminating their evolution .",
    "the vast majority of stars and metals produced during the evolution of galaxies were formed and still reside in them .",
    "therefore , examining the star formation history and measuring the metal content of galaxies may tell us how these systems evolve through cosmic time .",
    "the study of the global properties of elliptical galaxies took a substantial step forward with the application of multivariate analysis , revealing potentially meaningful scaling relations like the fundamental plane ( fp , brosche 1973 ) .",
    "however , the importance of the technique pioneered by this paper was not immediately realised by the astronomical community . determining which dimensions are statistically significant in a given data set is not a simple task , but it can reveal useful correlations involving the quantities defining a minimal manifold and provide insights into the physical nature of such correlations .",
    "such is the case when the observed fp is associated with the virial theorem ( djorgovski & davis  1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "many studies over the past twenty years have tried to interpret the physical meaning of the fp ( e.g. faber et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski & de carvalho  1990 ; pahre et al .  1998b ; @xcite ; @xcite ; dantas et al .  2003 ; @xcite ; nelan et al .  2005 ; cappellari et al .",
    "the striking feature of the fp is its narrowness , implying a regularity among the global properties of early - type galaxies .",
    "the quantities containing the entire variance of the data are : effective radius , @xmath24 , central velocity dispersion , @xmath25 , and mean surface brightness measured within the effective radius , @xmath26 .",
    "the best representation of the fp is @xmath27 @xmath23 @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is mean surface brightness in flux units .",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003c ) show a comprehensive table listing the most important papers presenting values of a and b and their respective errors . a seems to vary with the passband used in the photometric observation , while b does not ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite , found only a marginally significant variation of a in the sdss optical passbands ( see also hyde & bernardi  2009 ) .",
    "la barbera et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( hereafter lbm08 ) also found a small difference in a when measured between r and k bands .    assuming that early - type galaxies are homologous systems in dynamical equilibrium and that velocity dispersion is related to the kinetic energy per unit mass we can write down expressions for mass ( m ) and luminosity ( l ) , namely ( m",
    "/ l ) @xmath30 . in the case of a fully virialized system , a = 2 and b = -1 , implying a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "however , a and b are found to differ significantly from the virial values , resulting in the so - called @xmath31 of the fp . in this case , m / l @xmath32 , where gamma is @xmath230.25 ( faber et al .",
    "this dependence of the mass - to - light ratio on galaxy mass has been interpreted as arising either from differences in the stellar populations or the dark matter fractions among etgs .",
    "it is important to emphasize that another option to explain the tilt is related to the assumption that etgs are truly virialized systems - in which case they should have self - similar density distributions and similar orbital distributions .",
    "any departure from either or both of these conditions may well explain the tilt , and several studies have tried to disentangle these effects . for instance , non - homology seems to contribute to at least part of the tilt ( @xcite , capelato , de carvalho & carlberg  1995 ; ciotti , lanzoni & renzini  1996 ; ciotti & lanzoni  1997 ; graham & colless  1997 ; busarello et al .",
    "1997 ; bertin , ciotti , & del principe  2002 ; trujillo , burkert & bell  2004 ) .",
    "even studies trying to explain the tilt as a stellar population effect concluded that non - homology may play a significant role in determining the tilt of the fp ( e.g. pahre , djorgovski & de carvalho 1998b ; forbes & ponman  1999 ) .",
    "another interesting finding from the simulations of capelato et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is that when measuring the structural parameters defining the fp inside larger apertures , of order a few r@xmath33 , the coefficients are similar to those implied by the virial theorem .",
    "more recently , bolton et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find a similar result when using the surface density term defined by the mass measured through strong lensing , and conclude that the tilt of the fp is due to the fraction of dark matter inside one effective radius ( see also tortora et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "this is the second paper of a series analysing the properties and the scaling relations of etgs as a function of the environment where they reside .",
    "the spheroids panchromatic investigation in different environmental regions ( spider ) utilises optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry in the @xmath1 wavebands , along with spectroscopic data , taken from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey - large area survey ( ukidss - las ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the selection of etgs for this project is detailed in paper i , and we refer the reader to that paper for all the details of sample selection and the procedures used to derive the galaxy parameters .    in this work we focus on the derivation of the fp in the @xmath1 wavebands for the entire spider sample .",
    "although our sample contains etgs over the entire domain of local density ( from field to clusters ) , we postpone the study of the environmental dependence of the fp to another paper in the spider series ( paper iii ) . in the present work",
    ", we discuss the main pitfalls of the fp fitting procedure and how to account for selection effects and different sources of biases .",
    "we analyse the edge - on and face - on projections of the fp , as well as the two other projections of the fp , i.e. the kormendy and faber - jackson relations .",
    "the analysis of these two scaling relations serves as a reference at the local universe ( z@xmath00.1 ) , and at different wavebands , for other studies lacking data for a full fp analysis .",
    "we find a consistent picture connecting the waveband variation of the edge- and face - on projections of the fp with that of the kormendy and faber - jackson relations .",
    "finally , we show how the optical and nir fps can constrain various scenarios for galaxy formation and evolution , by using the wavelength dependence of the fp to infer the variation of stellar population parameters along the etg s sequence .",

    "the spider data - set is based on a sample of @xmath37 etgs ( see  paper i for details ) , with available @xmath38 photometry and spectroscopy from sdss - dr6 .",
    "out of these galaxies , @xmath39 objects have also photometry available in the @xmath40 wavebands from ukidss - las .",
    "all galaxies have two estimates of the central velocity dispersion , one from sdss - dr6 and an alternative measurement obtained by fitting sdss spectra with the software starlight  @xcite , using a linear combination of simple stellar population models ( rather than single templates as in sdss ) with different ages and metallicities . in both cases , starlight and sdss - dr6 ,",
    "the @xmath41 s are aperture - corrected to an aperture of @xmath42 , following  @xcite . in order to make proper comparisons to earlier studies ( e.g. bernardi et al .",
    "2003a ) , we use sdss velocity dispersion measurements to examine the scaling relations presented in this paper . in paper",
    "i , we find that the mean difference between @xmath43(sdss - dr6 ) and @xmath43(starlight ) does not change significantly with @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that the choice of a given velocity dispersion measurement might have a dramatic impact on the fp relation .",
    "this is further discussed in secs .  6 ,  7 , and  9 .",
    "in all wavebands , structural parameters ",
    "i.e. the effective radius , @xmath44 , the mean surface brightness within that radius , @xmath3 , and the sersic index , @xmath45 have been all homogeneously measured by 2dphot  @xcite . in the optical ( @xmath38 ) , alternative estimates of the effective parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath3 , are also available from the sdss - dr6 _ photo _ pipeline . in  paper",
    "i , we compare the different estimates of photometric and spectroscopic parameters , deriving also an estimate of the @xmath46 completeness limit of the sample in all wavebands .",
    "we find that 2dphot total magnitudes are brighter than sdss model magnitudes , with the difference amounting to @xmath47  mag in r - band , for the faintest galaxies in the sample .",
    "this difference is due to the use of sersic ( 2dphot ) rather than de vaucouleurs ( _ photo _ ) models to fit the light distribution of etgs , as well as to the sky estimate bias affecting sdss effective parameters  @xcite .",
    "hence , the completeness limit of the sample is also dependent on the source of effective parameters ( 2dphot vs. _ photo _ ) . in r band ,",
    "the sample is @xmath46 complete at @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the sdss and 2dphot parameters , respectively . in the following , unless explicitly said , we refer to 2dphot total magnitudes .",
    "the waveband dependence of the fp is analysed using different subsamples of etgs , extracted from the spider sample .",
    "details on each subsample are provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : fpsamples ] . in order to analyse the effect of different sources of bias on the fp relation , we also utilise several samples of etgs , with effective parameters in r band .",
    "we describe the characteristics of these samples in sec .",

    ".magnitude limits in @xmath1 adopted to derive the fp . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : age_zeta ]",
    "one of the crucial aspects of the present study is the fitting procedure used to obtain the coefficients of the fp and how they are affected by different systematic effects .",
    "different fitting techniques produce different estimates of fp coefficients , and may lead to erroneous results when comparing the fp relations obtained with different samples ( lbc00 ; @xcite ) . to avoid this problem , we adopt the same fitting method for all the etg subsamples we analyze .",
    "selection effects and correlated errors on effective parameters can be taken into account analytically under the assumption that the fp variables are normally distributed  @xcite .",
    "although  @xcite showed that the joint distribution of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and galaxy magnitude is relatively well described by a multivariate gaussian , this might not necessarely be true when effective parameters are derived by the sersic ( 2dphot ) rather than de vaucouleurs ( photo ) model .",
    "these two pipelines yield significant differences in @xmath50 and magnitudes ( see  paper i ) .",
    "these differences depend on galaxy magnitude , and may be partly due to the sky overestimation problem affecting the sdss photo parameters .",
    "we have adopted a non- parametric approach , first fitting the fp relation and then correcting the slopes for different systematic effects using extensive monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we find that the main source of bias on the fp slopes is the magnitude cut . in agreement with  @xcite",
    ", we show that for the orthogonal fit this cut leads to underestimating the fp coefficients , with the effect becoming negligible only at faint magnitude limits ( @xmath52 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] ) .",
    "the effect is negligible when we use the @xmath51 fitting method . as shown by  lbc00 , minimizing the @xmath51 residuals leads to a @xmath51 slope of the fp systematically higher than that obtained by other fitting techniques ( see also jfk96 ) .",
    "we also find that the coefficient @xmath8 of the fp in the optical ( sdss ) wavebands are systematically larger when we use the @xmath51   method compared to results obtained with the orthogonal fitting procedure . in r - band the difference amounts to @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath13 turns out to be systematically lower , by @xmath54 , for the  @xmath51 method ( see tabs .  [ tab : fp_ls_coef ] and   [ tab : fp_orth_coef ] ) .",
    "another important result we find is that the difference produced by different fitting method depends on waveband ( see also  lbm08 ) .",
    "the fp coefficients do not change with the waveband when using the @xmath51 method , while they smoothly vary , by @xmath55 , from @xmath10 through @xmath18 when using the orthogonal method .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the @xmath51 regression minimizes the rms of residuals in the perpendicular direction to the @xmath50@xmath3 plane , and hence it is less sensitive to differences in the distribution of galaxies in that plane , like those among effective parameters measured in different wavebands .",
    "the problem of deriving the best fitting coefficients of correlations among astrophysical quantities has been addressed by  @xcite .",
    "they concluded that , in case one aims to study the underlying functional relation among the variables , regression procedures treating all the variables symmetrically , like the orthogonal method , should be adopted .",
    "for this reason , we have analyzed the implications of the waveband dependence of the fp adopting the results of the orthogonal regression .       in the present study",
    ", we find that the slope of the kr exhibits a small systematic variation with waveband , steepening by @xmath57 from @xmath10 through @xmath18 .",
    "this variation may be explained as the ratio of optical to nir effective radii decreasing for galaxies with larger @xmath44 , namely , while smaller size etgs have , on average , optical radii larger than the nir ones , the most massive galaxies have @xmath58 . in the assumption that @xmath59 is a proxy for the internal colour gradient of an etg",
    ", this finding implies that the stellar populations of the most massive etgs have a more homogeneous spatial distribution inside the galaxies , i.e. flatter radial gradients , than less massive systems .",
    "@xcite found that the relation between the internal metallicity gradient and mass in early - type systems is bimodal , with a sharp transition at @xmath60 .",
    "this magnitude corresponds approximately to the lower cut applied to the spider sample ( paper i ) . for @xmath61 , etgs exhibit a tight correlation between the metallicity gradient and either mass , luminosity , or @xmath51 .",
    "brighter galaxies tend to have steeper gradients , as expected by the lower efficiency of feedback processes in less bound ( massive ) systems  @xcite . at higher mass , colour gradients",
    "exhibit a larger scatter , with no sharp dependence on galaxy mass .",
    "it is currently not clear how the results of @xcite can be reconciled with the variation in the ratio of effective radii with radius we find here .",
    "in fact , colour gradients are also determined by the change in the profile shape ( i.e. the sersic index ) , besides radius , with waveband . moreover , both metallicity and ( small ) age gradients can combine to produce the observed internal colour gradients of etgs ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the trend of @xmath62 with @xmath63 is consistent with a recent finding by  @xcite , who analyzed how the ratio of effective radii measured in @xmath10 and @xmath64 ( using sdss ) correlate with several galaxy properties , for different families of etgs ( normal e / s0 galaxies and bcgs ) . although limited to the optical regime , they find that the mean ratio of radii measured in @xmath10 and @xmath64 become flatter for larger galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reg_rek ] ) .",
    "the trend of @xmath62 can be explained by the increasing importance of dissipationless mergers in the formation of more massive galaxies with galaxy mass .",
    "indeed , dry mergers are expected to wash out internal differences of stellar population properties in galaxies  @xcite .",
    "a major role of dry mergers in the formation of massive etgs has also been suggested , in a theoretical framework , by  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "lbm08 derived the fp relation in the @xmath64 ( sdss ) and @xmath18 ( ukidss ) wavebands , showing that the fp slopes exhibit only a small variation with waveband , and that this variation is degenerate with respect to ( i ) the gradients of stellar population properties ( i.e. age and metallicity ) with galaxy mass , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and ( ii ) the fraction of the fp tilt , @xmath67 , which is caused by stellar populations .",
    "one main result of the present study is that using the @xmath1 coefficients of the fp we are able to break this degeneracy .",
    "the resulting probability distribution of @xmath67 is sharply peaked around zero , implying that the tilt of the fp in the nir is not due to stellar populations .",
    "this result is in agreement with that of  trujillo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who found that the slope of the @xmath68 vs. luminosity relation in k - band can be entirely due to structural non - homology of etgs ( see also  @xcite ) . in b band",
    ", they found that a minor , but still significant fraction ( one - quarter ) of the tilt is due to stellar populations .",
    "the results of  trujillo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) contrast those of  @xcite , who argued that the tilt is more likely caused by a variation of the dark matter content with mass , with stellar populations playing a minor role , which fully agrees with our finding .",
    "recently ,  @xcite have derived the fp relation for a sample of fifty - six etgs in the visible ( v ) , nir ( k ) , and mir ( spitzer irac ) wavelengths and concluded that the slope @xmath8 of the fp increases with the waveband .",
    "however , the uncertainties ( see their tab .",
    "2 ) seem to be still too large to conclude if @xmath8 increases even further in the mir wavebands .",
    "spectroscopic studies of stellar population properties in etgs have found that the ( luminosity - weighted ) age of etgs tends to increase along the galaxy sequence , as parametrized in terms of either velocity dispersion or stellar and dynamical mass ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "the ages are usually estimated comparing line spectral indices with the expectations from stellar population models .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that the slope of the @xmath69 vs. @xmath70 relation is @xmath71 ( see their tab .",
    "this value is estimated for a sample of etgs with a dynamical mass @xmath72 , with a limiting magnitude comparable to that we adopt here in this work .",
    "the value of @xmath73 from  @xcite is significantly larger than what we obtain here , although still marginally consistent within 2-@xmath74 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : age_zeta ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have to consider that age and metallicity values from spectroscopic studies always refer to the central galaxy region .",
    "aperture corrections are based on measurements of line spectral indices for small samples of etgs at @xmath75 and apply only to a relatively small radial range , with @xmath76 ( see  @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "adopt a different approach and instead of correcting the indices , test how the stellar population parameters vary with redshift , up to @xmath77 , for galaxies with similar physical properties ( e.g. dynamical mass ) .",
    "the main drawback of this approach is that it relies on the assumption that spectral indices and their gradients do not evolve with redshift .",
    "considering the redshift range ( @xmath78 ) , large galaxies are still observed only in a radial region of @xmath79 .",
    "the values of @xmath65 and @xmath80 we obtain from the fp analysis describe the total stellar population content of etgs , as the photometric parameters entering the fp are defined in terms of the total galaxy luminosity of the 2d sersic model .",
    "the information encoded in the fp is more similar to that provided by the colour - magnitude relation , where galaxy colours are usually measured within a larger aperture than that sampled by spectroscopic studies .",
    "in fact , in agreement with our findings , @xcite showed that the small redshift evolution of the cm relation implies that ( i ) all the ( luminous ) etgs are equally old and ( ii ) more massive galaxies are more metal rich than less massive systems .    in the framework of the sauron project , for a sample of twenty - five etgs , @xcite found that the variation of the dynamical @xmath81 is well correlated with the h@xmath82 line - strength , implying that most of the tilt of the fp ( i.e. the deviation of fp coefficients from the virial theorem expectation under the assumption of homology and constant @xmath68 ) is indeed due to galaxy age varying with mass .",
    "this result apparently contrasts with findings of  trujillo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and  @xcite , and with our results , where both @xmath67 and @xmath83 are consistent with zero .",
    "however , as also noticed by  lbm08 , 68% of the galaxies in the  @xcite sample are fast rotators and 20% have low velocity dispersion ( @xmath74=60 - 85 km s @xmath84 ) .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite have found that the fp of spheroidal systems depends on the covered range in mass and velocity dispersion ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) , with the tilt becoming larger ( smaller @xmath8 ) for galaxies in the low @xmath41 regime .",
    "@xcite derived the nuv and fuv fp of thirty - four etgs from the sauron sample .",
    "they showed that the tilt is significantly affected by residual star formation in etgs , mostly found at low @xmath41 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "hence , the above mentioned disagreement with the findings of  @xcite might be explained by the different range of velocity dispersion and different selection criteria of both samples .",
    "it is important to remember , as we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : fp_gal_pars ] , that different subsamples of etgs do not share the same fp relations .",
    "when binning the spider sample according to sersic index and axis ratio , we find that the tilt of the fp becomes larger ( i.e. the slopes of the fp decrease ) by a small but detectable amount for galaxies with higher @xmath45 and larger @xmath86 , with the effect being mainly due to a difference in the @xmath13 coefficient of the fp .",
    "the result for @xmath45 is consistent with   @xcite , who found that in the optical regime the @xmath13 coefficient decreases significantly as the sersic index increases , while @xmath8 is constant .",
    "however , one should notice that  @xcite did not account for the fact that galaxies in different bins of @xmath45 have different distributions in the space of the fp variables , and , as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : fp_gal_pars ] , this might prevent a proper comparison of fp coefficients .",
    "the fact that the variation of the fp tilt among galaxies with different @xmath45 and @xmath86 is similar from @xmath10 through @xmath18 suggests that it is more related to differences of galaxy properties ( structural and dynamical ) , rather than to differences in the galaxy stellar population content .",

    ", they found that the fps of es and s0s have consistent slopes .",
    "they also found that the fp of early - type spirals has a larger tilt ( smaller @xmath8 ) with respect to that of etgs , likely due to a variation of the luminosity - weighted age with galaxy mass .",

    "when using the @xmath112 fit , we find that @xmath8 is consistent , within 2-@xmath74 , from @xmath64 to @xmath18 and for @xmath10 band @xmath8 differs significantly by @xmath233@xmath74 , while @xmath13 is all very consistent . using the orthogonal fit , however",
    ", @xmath8 significantly varies by 12% from @xmath10 through @xmath18 and @xmath13 does not change at all .    3 - the analysis of the face - on and edge - on projections of the fp indicate , first of all , consistency with the results obtained when examining the fj and kr .",
    "moreover , the scatter around the edge - on projection is about twice smaller than that of the face - on s , indicating that the fp is more like a band rather than a plane .    4 - we test the sensitivity of the fp solution to the velocity dispersion measurement used , @xmath113(starlight ) versus @xmath114(sdss - dr6 ) .",
    "although these two measurements agree remarkably well , the value of @xmath8 is systematically smaller when using the starlight values of @xmath115 , while @xmath13 is insensitive to both measurements . also , we find that the waveband dependence of the fp is the same regardless of the magnitude range used in the analysis .    5 -",
    "the sample analysed is formed by etgs covering a certain domain in galaxy properties , like axis ratio ( @xmath86 ) , sersic index ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath116 colour , and @xmath117 .",
    "the fp slopes vary significantly for etgs with different properties in the following way : etgs with larger @xmath45 have lower @xmath13 ; @xmath8 is smaller in the nir for the @xmath118 subsample , and in the optical both subsamples have similar @xmath8 s ; the fp of round galaxies has smaller @xmath8 ( and smaller @xmath13 ) than the fp obtained for lower @xmath86 etgs - the difference is more evident in the nir . also , boxy and bluer ( @xmath116 ) etgs exhibit an fp with lower @xmath13 , with this difference disappearing in the nir wavebands .",
    "6 - finally , we show that current semi analytical models of galaxy formation match the results here obtained from the analysis of the fp tilt from @xmath10 through @xmath18 .",
    "this analysis implies that the nir tilt of the fp is not due to stellar populations : massive etgs have coeval stellar populations , and are more metal rich than less massive systems .",
    "this is one of the crucial points of the fp study presented here .",
