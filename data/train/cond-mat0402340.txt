    "more than 15 years after the discovery of the high-@xmath0 superconductors , the mechanisms leading to their unusual properties are still under debate . especially the pseudogap phase , which appears in various experiments below a characteristic temperature @xmath4 in the underdoped region of the phase diagram as a reduction of spectral weight @xcite , might be a key to a better understanding of the high-@xmath0 superconducting ( sc ) cuprates . in 1995",
    "emery and kivelson @xcite proposed , that the proximity to the mott insulating phase implies a strongly reduced phase stiffness @xmath5 compared to the usual bcs case .",
    "this causes the phase ordering temperature @xmath6 to be much lower than the mean - field pair - binding temperature @xmath7 .",
    "taking this idea one step further @xcite implies that at least part of the pseudogap behavior might be due to a kind of `` pre - formed '' cooper pairs which form at a temperature @xmath8 well above the actual sc transition temperature @xmath9 , where phase coherence among these pairs finally sets in .",
    "this phase fluctuation scenario also explains quite natural the strongly enhanced nernst signal above @xmath0 in the underdoped cuprates @xcite .    in previous work",
    ", we have already shown that indeed a two - dimensional bcs - like hamiltonian with a @xmath1-wave gap and phase fluctuations , which were treated by a monte - carlo simulation of an @xmath10 model , yields results which compare very well with scanning tunneling measurements over a wide temperature range @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this phenomenological phase fluctuation model was also able to explain the possible `` violation '' of the in - plane optical integral in underdoped bi@xmath11sr@xmath11cacu@xmath11o@xmath12 ( bi2212 ) @xcite .",
    "however , for the phase fluctuation description to be correct over a wide temperature range , one needs a mechanism that produces `` cheap '' vortices , so that the only energy scale is the stiffness @xmath13 and the dominating fluctuation channel is that of the phase of the sc order parameter .",
    "mechanisms that can lead to a small vortex core energy range from the more conventional picture of a granular superconductor , where the vortices arrange themselves to live in the insulating regions between the sc grains , up to the existence of a competing order that exists inside the vortex cores .",
    "as soon as the superconducting order parameter is suppressed inside the vortex core , the system develops the competing order instead of going into a normal conducting paramagnetic state and thus has a much smaller vortex energy compared to a conventional bcs superconductor .",
    "recently , it was shown @xcite , that vortices with staggered - flux core can provide a way to understand the low vortex energy over a wide temperature range above @xmath0 . in all cases , the small phase stiffness and the low vortex core energy",
    "have the same origin , which is the proximity to the mott - insulating state .    in this paper",
    ", we present theoretical results on the quasiparticle dispersion , which  when compared with experimental data  give a clear fingerprint towards a possible phase fluctuation scenario for the origin of the pseudogap .",
    "earlier angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) results have shown deviations from the simple bcs @xmath1-wave form of the sc gap in underdoped bi2212 @xcite , which might be due to a change in the pairing interaction in the proximity of the af insulating phase . by analyzing the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle ( qp ) dispersion , we want to show , that the change of the qp dispersion in crossing @xmath0 from the sc to the pseudogap region can be understood quite naturally by the assumption that the pseudogap is caused by phase fluctuations of the sc gap .",
    "moreover , the phase fluctuation scenario also explains the deviations from the simple @xmath1-wave form of sc and pseudogap @xcite in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "using the arpes with tunable excitation photon energy we disentangle bilayer splitting related effects and determine the true dispersion and the leading edge gap ( leg ) function corresponding to the bonding band in the pseudogap regime of pb - bi2212 .    since below @xmath0",
    "the qp excitations are perfectly bcs - like unless in the extremely underdoped region @xcite , it is tempting to start from the bcs ground state and see how it is destroyed by including phase fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in the following we use a phenomenological phase fluctuation model which has already been shown to successfully account for the pseudogap observed in tunneling experiments @xcite and which was also able to explain the possible `` violation '' of the in - plane optical integral in underdoped bi2212 @xcite .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the usual tight - binding hamiltonian of non - interacting electrons on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice @xmath16 here , @xmath17",
    "( @xmath18 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron of spin @xmath19 on the @xmath20 site of the 2d square lattice and @xmath21 is the number operator .",
    "@xmath22 denotes an effective nearest - neighbor hopping - term and @xmath23 is the chemical potential .",
    "the angles @xmath24 indicate sums over nearest - neighbor sites of the 2d square lattice .    the second part of the hamiltonian @xmath25 contains a bcs - like @xmath26-wave interaction , which is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 connecting nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath29 stands for the strength of the effective next - neighbor @xmath1-wave pairing - interaction .",
    "the origin of this pairing interaction is unimportant for the further calculation",
    ". it can be either of pure electronic origin , like spin fluctuations , or phonon mediated .",
    "the only important thing is , that there exists an effective pairing interaction , that produces a finite local @xmath1-wave gap as one goes below a certain temperature @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to conventional bcs theory , we consider the pairing - field amplitude not as a constant real number , but rather as a complex number @xmath30 with a _ constant _ magnitude @xmath31 and a _ fluctuating _ bond - phase field @xmath32 . in order to get a description , where the _ center of mass _ phases of the cooper pairs are the only relevant degrees of freedom @xcite , we write the @xmath1-wave bond - phase field in the following way @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the _ center of mass _ phase of a cooper pair localized at lattice site @xmath35 .    in order to account for the proximity to the mott insulating state and thus the low superfluid density , we perform a _ quenched average _ over all possible phase configurations with the statistical weight given by the classical @xmath10 free energy @xmath36 = - j \\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } \\cos\\left(\\varphi_i-\\varphi_j\\right ) , \\label{two}\\ ] ] where the phase stiffness @xmath13 determines the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath37 to a quasi phase ordered state which we take as @xmath0 . the @xmath10 free energy is defined on a coarse - grained lattice with the _ scale _ of the lattice spacing given by the pair coherence length @xcite @xmath38 .",
    "now , the underdoped cuprates are in an intermediate coupling regime between large bcs mean - field pairs and tightly - bound bec pairs @xcite , with the pair - size coherence length @xmath39 given by 3 to 4 times the basic cu - cu lattice spacing . for a typical @xmath40 fermionic lattice , which is numerical feasible",
    ", we would only have a @xmath41 phase lattice on top of it .",
    "this would not allow for any proper temperature scaling of the phase correlation length @xmath42 and obscure the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "therefore we have chosen to set @xmath43 .",
    "this yields @xmath44 and allows the monte carlo phase simulation to be carried out on the same @xmath45 lattice that is used for the diagonalization of the fermionic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in addition , the choice of @xmath46 automatically introduces the important short distance cut - off .",
    "finally we set @xmath47 , where we had the stm experiments of ref .   in mind .",
    "the arpes experiments were carried out using angle - multiplexing electron energy analyzers .",
    "spectra were recorded either with @xmath4821.218 ev photons from a he source or using radiation from the u125/1-pgm beamline at the bessy synchrotron radiation facility .",
    "the total energy resolution was set to 17 mev ( fwhm ) at @xmath48 38 ev .",
    "the angular resolution was kept below 0.2@xmath49 both along and perpendicular to the analyzer entrance slit .",
    "data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] were taken with 0.2@xmath49 x 0.3@xmath49 angular resolution .",
    "the data were collected on two similar underdoped , modulation - free single crystals of pb - bi2212 ( @xmath0=77k ) .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] shows the quasiparticle dispersion calculated from our phenomenological phase fluctuation model for @xmath50 doping ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the spectral weight is plotted along the @xmath52 direction through the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the free dispersion would cross the fermi surface close to the @xmath53-point .",
    "one can clearly see that the characteristic ( back - turning ) bogoliubov quasiparticle band disappears in the pseudogap state above @xmath0 .",
    "instead , one obtains a sharp quasiparticle dispersion which runs straight towards the fermi energy and than fades out at a distance of the order of the superconducting ( sc ) gap @xmath54 .",
    "this is in complete agreement with the experimentally observed dispersion in underdoped bi2212 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the angle resolved data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] provide an insight into how the pseudogap is actually created near @xmath55 . in the superconducting state a characteristic bsc - like back - dispersion is easily seen .",
    "this clarity is achieved by the careful choice of the excitation photon energy .",
    "exactly near h@xmath56=38 ev",
    "the emission probability for the bonding band is much higher than for the antibonding band @xcite and bilayer - related complications are thus avoided .",
    "above @xmath0 in the pseudogap state the characteristic bcs behavior is replaced by the straight dispersion and strong depletion of the spectral weight towards @xmath57 , which , as will be shown below , still leaves the energy gap in the spectrum .    furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the sharp quasiparticle features close to the @xmath53-point are getting lost above @xmath0 within the phase fluctuation model .",
    "the sharp coherent @xmath53-peaks dissappear and broad incoherent weight _ fills - in _ the gap .",
    "exactly this behavior was observed before in photoemission studies of the pseudogap @xcite and is also responsible for the characteristic temperature dependence of the scanning tunneling gap in the underdoped cuprates @xcite , where the pseudogap fills - in instead of closing .",
    "interestingly , not only sc fluctuations @xcite , but also staggered flux fluctuations @xcite can lead to this temperature dependence of the @xmath53-photoemission - peak .",
    "the disappearance of the characteristic bcs bands above @xmath0 within the phase fluctuation picture can be understood by the fact , that the bcs wave - function is a coherent superposition of wave functions with different number of electron pairs @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a n - particle wavefunction .",
    "the quantum mechanical uncertainty in the particle number is given by : @xmath60 now @xmath61 is the momentum distribution function for @xmath62 and the weight of a quasiparticle peak at momentum @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .    in the normal metallic state with @xmath68 ,",
    "one gets a sharp cut - off in @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) at the fermi - wavevector @xmath69 so that @xmath70 . in the bcs - superconducting state ,",
    "however , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) are finite also beyond the fermi - wavevector @xmath55 , which means that also for @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) one gets spectral weight at @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this produces the characteristic bcs band structure , with bands approaching @xmath57 from below ( above ) and then turning back to higher binding ( quasiparticle ) energies .",
    "now what happens if one introduces an arbitrary phase factor into the bcs wave function @xcite @xmath73 integrating over all possible phases yields @xcite @xmath74 this means , that one projects into an exact particle - number eigenstate by making the relative phase of the cooper - pairs completely uncertain .",
    "( [ number ] ) is a special case of the general uncertainty relation between phase and particle number @xmath75 the above described behavior corresponds to what is happening in the phase - fluctuation model as a function of temperature .",
    "starting from a phase coherent state at @xmath62 with @xmath76 , the particle number is completely uncertain with @xmath77 given by eq .",
    "[ number ] . with increasing temperature",
    ", one _ gradually projects into a state with exact particle number _ @xmath78 . in the temperature range , where the phases are completely uncorrelated ( @xmath79 ) , one then obtains @xmath80 , and the back - turning bcs - bands must completely dissappear ( loose weight for @xmath81 , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . at finite temperatures , this situation corresponds to a classical grand canonical average over ensembles with different number of particles , where each state has a well defined particle number and is no longer a coherent quantum - mechanical superposition of states with different number of particles .",
    "thus , we obtain a crossover from a bcs - like phase - ordered band structure to a completely new phase - disordered _ pseudo - gaped _ band structure .",
    "next we want to elucidate the effect of phase fluctuations on the @xmath82-dependence of the quasiparticle pairing gap .",
    "therefore , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the quasiparticle dispersion obtained from mc simulations of the phase fluctuation model along the fermi surface of the free dispersion @xmath83 at half - filling ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this gives us effectively the gap function @xmath85 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , below @xmath0 one obtains the characteristic @xmath86-shape of a gap with @xmath1 pairing symmetry .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the quasiparticles peaks are getting broader . in the pseudogap state above @xmath0",
    ", the spectral weight is getting rather incoherent close the the @xmath3 as was pointed out before .",
    "however , close to the nodal point of the gap function one still obtains a sharp quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "there , one can clearly see spectral weight shifting to lower binding energies which produces an _ extended gapless region _ in the pseudogap state close to @xmath2 instead of the nodal point in the superconducting state below @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is in complete agreement with photoemission experiments @xcite which show that the pseudogap starts closing from @xmath2 where one obtains a finite fermi - arc but rather _ fills in _ at @xmath3 exactly as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( top ) .",
    "furthermore , the pseudogap @xmath85 obtained from phase fluctuations of the local @xmath1 pairing - amplitude rather has a u - like shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , top ) than the characteristic v - shape of a bcs @xmath1-gap .",
    "for comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the experimentally observed pseudogap in underdoped bi2212 .",
    "one can clearly see that the experimentally determined pseudogap has exactly the u - like form that we have obtained from the phase fluctuation model .",
    "this deviation from the pure @xmath1-wave form was also observed in the superconducting state of very underdoped cuprates and interpreted as higher harmonic contributions to the pairing function @xcite .",
    "however , these experimental results just might indicate the possible relevance of quantum phase fluctuations in this region of the phase diagram .",
    "our results on the effects of phase fluctuations on the form of the pairing gap could also be of some relevance for electron doped cuprates @xcite where a possible crossover from a @xmath1 ( or anisotropic @xmath87-wave ) to a pure @xmath87-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap as a function of electron doping was observed @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have elaborated the important role that phase fluctuation effects might play in the underdoped cuprates . with a detailed comparison between theory and experiment",
    "we were able to show how phase fluctuations influence the quasiparticle spectra .",
    "in particular the disappearance of the bcs - bogoliubov quasiparticle band at @xmath0 and the change from a more v - like superconducting gap to a rather u - like pseudogap above @xmath0 can be explained in a consistent way by assuming that the low energy pseudogap in the underdoped cuprates is due to phase fluctuations of a local @xmath1-wave pairing gap with fixed magnitude .",
    "furthermore , phase fluctuations can explain why the pseudogap starts closing from the nodal points , whereas it rather fills in along the anti - nodal directions .",
