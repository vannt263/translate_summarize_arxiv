    "the variability of a certain class of shapes is of interest in various fields of applied mathematics and it is of particular importance in the field of computational anatomy . in mathematics and computer vision , shapes have been represented in many different ways : point clouds , surfaces or images are only some examples .",
    "these shape spaces are inherently non - linear . as an example , consider the shape space of all surfaces of a certain dimension and genus .",
    "the nonlinearity makes it difficult to do statistics .",
    "one way to overcome this difficulty is to introduce a riemannian structure on the space of shapes .",
    "this enables us to locally linearize the space and develop statistics based on geodesic methods .",
    "another advantage of the riemannian setting for shape analysis is its intuitive notion of similarity .",
    "namely , two shapes that differ only by a small deformation are regarded as similar to each other .    in this article",
    "we will concentrate on shape spaces of surfaces and we will give an overview of the different riemannian structures , that have been considered on these spaces .",

    "a riemannian metric on @xmath6 that is invariant under the action of @xmath7 induces a metric on @xmath15 , such that the projection @xmath16 is a riemannian submersion .",

    "weak riemannian metrics are a purely infinite - dimensional phenomenon and they are the source of most of the analytical complications , that we will encounter .",
    "a way to define riemannian metrics on the space of parametrized submanifolds is via the left action of @xmath17 on @xmath14 , @xmath18 here @xmath17 denotes the lie group of all compactly supported diffeomorphisms of @xmath3 with lie algebra the space @xmath19 of all compactly supported vector fields , see sect .",

    "while a geodesic on @xmath17 is a curve @xmath29 of diffeomorphisms , its right - logarithmic derivative @xmath30 is a curve of vector fields .",

    "denote by @xmath37 the euclidean metric on @xmath3 and consider the pull - back map @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the space of all riemannian metrics on @xmath1 and @xmath40 denotes the pull - back of @xmath37 to a metric on @xmath1 . depending on the dimension of @xmath1 one",

    "this space , known as _ super space _",

    "little is known about the properties of the pull - back map , but as a first step it is of interest to consider riemannian metrics on the space @xmath39 .",
    "this is done in sect .",
    "[ sec_mets ] , with special emphasis on the @xmath52- or ebin - metric .      after having explained the spaces , that will play the main roles in the paper and the relationships between them , what are the questions that we will be asking ?",
    "the questions are motivated by applications to comparing shapes .",
    "after equipping the space with a riemannian metric , the simplest way to compare shapes is by looking at the matrix of pairwise distances , measured with the induced geodesic distance function .",
    "thus an important question is , whether the geodesic distance function is point - separating , that is whether for two distinct shapes @xmath53 we have @xmath54 . in finite dimensions",
    "the answer to this question is always `` yes '' .",
    "even more , a standard result of riemannian geometry states that the topology induced by the geodesic distance coincides with the manifold topology . in infinite dimensions ,",
    "when the manifold is equipped with a weak riemannian metric , this is in general not true any more .",
    "the topology induced by the geodesic distance will also be weaker than the manifold topology .",
    "we will therefore survey what is known about the geodesic distance and the topology it induces .    the path realizing the distance between two shapes is , if it exists , a geodesic .",
    "so it is natural to look at the geodesic equation on the manifold . in finite dimensions",
    "the geodesic equation is an ode , the initial value problem for geodesics can be solved , at least for short times , and the solution depends smoothly on the initial data .",
    "the manifolds of interest in this paper are naturally modeled mostly as frchet manifolds and in coordinates the geodesic equation is usually a partial differential equation or even involves pseudo differential operators .",
    "only the regulat lie group @xmath55 of diffeomorphisms with compact support on a noncompact manifold are modeled on @xmath56-spaces .",
    "thus even the short - time solvability of the initial - value problem is a non - trivial question .",
    "for some of the metrics , in particular for the class of almost local metrics , it is still open .",
    "for the diffeomorphism group the geodesic equations for various metrics are of interest in their own right .",
    "to reflect this we will discuss in sect .",
    "[ diff_groups ] first the geodesic equations before proceeding with the properties of the geodesic distance .",
    "it is desirable for applications that the riemannian metric possesses some completeness properties",
    ". it can be either in form of geodesic completeness , i.e. , that geodesics are extendable for all time , or metric completeness with respect to the induced geodesic distance .",
    "since we are considering only weak riemannian metrics on spaces of smooth shapes , we can not expect the space to be metrically complete , but in some examples it is possible to at least describe the metric completion of shape space .    in order to perform statistics on shape space",
    "one can choose a reference shape , for example by computing the mean of a given set of shapes , and linearize the space around this shape via the riemannian exponential map and normal coordinates .",
    "the curvature tensor contains information about the accuracy of this approximation . in general computing",
    "the curvature leads to long formulas that are hard to interpret , but in some cases curvature admits a simple expression .",
    "we collect the examples , where more is known about the curvature , usually the sectional curvature , than just the formula for it .    to summarize",
    ", we will deal with the following four properties of riemannian metrics on shape spaces :    * geodesic distance * geodesic equation and existence of geodesics * geodesic and metric completeness * properties of the curvature    riemannian geometry on shape spaces is currently an active area of research .",
    "therefore this paper is less an encyclopedic treatment of the subject but rather resembles an interim report highlighting what is known and more importantly , what is not .",
    "there are many topics that lie outside the scope of this paper , among which are the following .",
    "_ changes in topology . _ in certain applications it may be of interest to consider deformations of a shape that allow for the development of holes or allow the shape to split into several components . in this paper",
    "we fix the model manifold @xmath1 and only consider submanifolds of @xmath3 diffeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "thus by definition all deformations are topology - preserving .",
    "see @xcite for topologically robust approaches to shape matching .",
    "_ non - geodesic distances .",
    "_ many interesting distances can be defined on shape spaces , that are not induced by an underlying riemannian metric ; see for example @xcite .",
    "as we are looking at shape spaces through the lens of riemannian geometry , these metrics will necessarily be left out of focus .",
    "_ subgroups of the diffeomorphism groups . _",
    "the riemannian geometry of the diffeomorphism group and its subgroups , especially the group of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms , has been studied extensively ; see for example @xcite .",
    "it plays an important role in hydrodynamics , being the configuration space for incompressible fluid flow @xcite .",
    "while the full diffeomorphism group itself is indispensable for shape analysis , its subgroups have not been used much in this context .    _ utmost generality .",
    "_ we did not strive to state the results in the most general setting .",
    "it is possible to consider shapes of higher codimension inside @xmath3 or curved ambient spaces ; see @xcite .",
    "this would include examples like space curves or curves that lie on a sphere .",
    "it would also make the presentation more difficult to read .",
    "_ numerical methods .",
    "_ since shape space is infinite - dimensional , computing the exponential map , the geodesic between two shapes or the geodesic distance are numerically non - trivial tasks .",
    "while we present some examples , we do not attempt to provide a comprehensive survey of the numerical methods that have been employed in the context of shape spaces .",
    "finding stable , robust and fast numerical methods and proving their convergence is an area of active research for most of the metrics and spaces discussed in this paper .",

    "we will repeatedly induce a riemannian metric on a quotient space using a given metric on the top space .",
