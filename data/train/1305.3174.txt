    "we call @xmath6 ( or @xmath10 ) a _ torus manifold _ if @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath12 is the set of fixed points . a toric manifold ( i.e. , a non - singular , complete toric variety viewed as a complex analytic space ) with the restricted @xmath9-action is a typical example of torus manifolds . recall that a toric manifold is a complex @xmath13-manifold with the dense orbit ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , and @xmath9 is the maximal compact subgroup of @xmath13",
    ". a fundamental result of toric geometry tells us that there is a one - to - one correspondence between toric manifolds and combinatorial objects called fans .",
    "thus , topological ( more precisely , geometric ) invariants of toric manifolds can be described in terms of combinatorial invarinats of fans , such as equivariant cohomology rings , equivariant characteristic classes and other topological invariants .    in 2003 , hattori - masuda introduced a torus manifold as the topological generalization of a toric manifold in @xcite .",
    "they also introduced the combinatorial objects , called multi - fans ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , and computed topological invariants ( such as equivariant characteristic classes or todd genus for unitary torus manifolds ) in terms of multi - fans .",
    "however , unlike toric geometry , a multi - fan does not contain enough information to determine some topological invariants of torus manifolds ( e.g. equivariant cohomology ) .",
    "so , in 2007 , maeda - masuda - panov introduced another combinatorial objects , called torus graphs motivated by gkm graphs introduced by guillemin - zara in @xcite .",
    "the combinatorial information of torus graphs can completely determine the equivariant cohomology rings of torus manifolds with vanishing odd degree cohomology , i.e. , @xmath14 ( in this paper , we only consider the integer coefficient ) , see @xcite , @xcite ( and also see section [ sect3 ] in this paper about torus graphs ) .",
    "however , in general , there is no one - to - one correspondence between torus manifolds with @xmath2 and torus graphs .",
    "so , we are naturally led to ask the following two questions : ( 1 ) which subclasses of torus manifolds are completely determined by combinatorial objects ( like multi - fans or torus graphs ) ; ( 2 ) if we find such a subclass of torus manifolds , how we can classify such torus manifolds .",
    "several mathematicians have answered to the 1st question ; for example , davis - januszkiewicz @xcite for the subclass called _ quasitoric manifolds _ ( see @xcite or section [ sect4.3 ] in this paper ) , ishida - fukukawa - masuda @xcite for the subclass called _ topological toric manifolds _ , and wiemeler for the class of simply connected @xmath0-dimensional torus manifolds with @xmath2 in @xcite ( see theorem [ wi2 ] ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to answer to the 2nd question for the class of simply connected @xmath0-dimensional torus manifolds with @xmath2 by using torus graphs .",
    "let us briefly recall the classification results for torus manifolds with lower dimensions .",

    "as one of the consequences of masuda - panov s theorem ( see theorem [ 2-equiv ] in section [ sect2.2 ] ) , we have the following proposition ( also see @xcite ) :    [ wiemeler ] let @xmath30 be a @xmath0-dimensional torus manifold with @xmath31 ( might not be simply connected ) . then , there are a simply connected , @xmath0-dimensional torus manifold @xmath6 with @xmath2 and a homology @xmath1-sphere @xmath32 such that @xmath33 up to equivariantly diffeomorphism .    here , in proposition [ wiemeler ] ,",

    "this type of classification , i.e. , classification by equivariant connected sum , may be regarded as the @xmath0-dimensional analogue of orlik - raymond s classification in theorem [ or - thm ] .",
