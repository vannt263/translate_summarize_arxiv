    "in the minimal standard model with massless neutrinos , the lepton family number is absolutely conserved so the decays @xmath1 do not occur . their observation would constitute clear evidence for new physics . in view of this",

    "the current experimental upper bounds are : b(k_l ^e^ ) < [ elimit ] this latter number represents the most sensitive kaon experiment to date . the proposed successor experiment , ags-871 , expects to improve the sensitivity by a factor of about 20 .",
    "a model independent study of this type of processes can be done following the approach of buchmller and wyler , ref .",
    "the physics beyond the standard model is parameterized by an effective lagrangian that is gauge invariant under @xmath10 .",
    "this lagrangian is given by a sum of four fermion operators , of which we present the purely left handed one as as example : _ v - a= c_v - a g^2 ^2 _ e ^ d .",
    "[ efop ] the factor @xmath11 is included to reflect the fact that we think of these operators as originating in the exchange of a heavy gauge boson ( or perhaps a scalar ) in the new physics sector .",
    "any additional factors , like mixing angles , are contained in the coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "it is conventional to assume that @xmath12 is of order @xmath13 , so that @xmath14 is the scale that characterizes the heavy degrees of freedom ( typically the mass of the exchanged boson ) .",
    "one then interprets the bounds on the decays induced by these operators as bounds on the `` scale of new physics '' @xmath14 .",
    "it is standard to compare this mode to the rate for @xmath15 , to absorb the hadronic matrix element as well as common kinematical factors in the limit @xmath16 .",

    "this result can be interpreted as a bound on the mass of new particles in different models @xcite .",
    "these decays are also allowed in minimal extensions of the standard model in which the neutrinos are given a mass .",
    "the decays then proceed via one - loop box diagrams .",
    "the decay rate for @xmath18 is proportional to the product of mixing angles between the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the heavy neutral lepton @xmath21 : @xmath22 . using the result @xmath23 @xcite , the authors of ref .",

    "@xmath26 can be as large as @xmath31 , although this happens only in a small corner of parameter space @xcite .    given the level of sensitivity expected for future experiments , as well as the small rates predicted in many models , it is important to study processes that could fake this one at the @xmath27 level .",
