    "both spectroscopic studies ( e.g. @xcite ) and photometric studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have shown that the homogeneity of heavy element abundances in globular clusters is quite small , typically less than 0.10 dex in [ fe / h ] . the scatter of stars from model isochrones in hr diagrams derived from hubble space telescope ( hst ) images in cases ( such as ngc 6397 ) has been similar in size to the measurement errors which implies that the metallicity variation among the stars in a given globular cluster must be less than a few hundredths of a dex ( e.g. , @xcite ) . although high quality hr diagrams of coeval , low metallicity , old globular clusters have been constructed , only quite recently has it been possible to construct hr diagrams of comparable photometric quality ( errors less than a few hundreds of a v band magnitude ) for younger and nearly solar metallicity coeval systems such as open clusters @xcite .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies have established an as yet unexplained possible connection between the metallicity of a star and the existence of short period extra solar planets around the parent star @xcite .",
    "compared to stars in the solar neighborhood , parent stars of short period extra - solar planets tend to have enhanced metallicities , @xmath2fe / h@xmath3 \\approx 0.2 \\pm 0.2 $ ] , compared to the sun .",
    "however , there is a significant scatter in the observed metallicities ; they range from about [ fe / h]@xmath4 to 0.4 @xcite .",
    "there are two possible explanations that account for the enhanced metallicities of parent stars with extra solar planets .",
    "one possibility is that gaseous planets may be rarer around fairly low metallicity stars . because the hst study of the globular cluster 47 tuc ( [ fe / h ] @xmath5 ) did not detect eclipses caused by planets , short period jovian planets",
    "could be an order of magnitude rarer than in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "however the lack of observed eclipses may instead be a result of the high stellar density in the cluster which would have caused the disruption of planetary systems @xcite .",
    "alternatively , gaseous planets may be produced with equal frequency near stars spanning a range of metallicities , but the subsequent evolution of the planetary systems increases the metallicities of the parent stars .",
    "there is certainly evidence based on abundance analyses in our solar system that impacts from bodies in the asteroid belt or outer solar system have changed the surface abundances of the earth and other planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one consequence of the orbital migrating of giant planets caused by scattering of a disk of planetesimals @xcite , is that the parent stars are polluted by star - impacting planetesimals @xcite .",
    "we infer that impacts with the sun probably occurred more frequently and for more massive bodies during the early era of our solar system .",
    "the transfer of angular momentum via driving of density waves into a proto - planetary gaseous disk will cause the orbital migration of a planet , and can also cause a planet to impact the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one advantage of the orbital migration scenario involving ejection of planetesimals compared to that involving density waves driven into a gaseous disk is that it pollutes the stars with metal rich planetary material when they are older and so have smaller convection zones ( e.g. , @xcite ) allowing a smaller amount of metals to cause a larger surface metallicity enrichment .",
    "because the fraction of mass in the convection zone depends on the stellar mass , higher mass stars ( e.g. , f stars ) with smaller convection zones could be more likely than lower mass stars with larger convection zones ( e.g. , k stars ) to have enhanced metallicities resulting from pollution caused by planetary material .",
    "however @xcite find no such trend among the parent stars of extra solar planets .",
    "@xcite find that the distribution of metallicities for parent stars of extrasolar planets is inconsistent with a model where these stars have been polluted by the addition of high - z material .    except for a narrow region at @xmath6 , known as the lithium dip , f stars keep lithium on their surface nearly their entire lifetime ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of li depletion implies that the convection zone does not mix with the interior of the star except within the lithium dip . for f stars outside the lithium dip",
    "little mixing takes place and a metallicity enhancement would last nearly the entire lifetime of the star , however f stars within the dip would not be expected to show metallicity enhancements .",
    "@xcite suggest that f stars near the lithium dip , tend to have lower metallicities than f stars outside the lithium dip .",
    "the stellar sample studied by @xcite and surveyed for planets draw on the population of stars in the solar neighborhood and so span a large range in ages and metallicities . to try and decouple the uncertainty caused by the metallicity scatter resulting from the range of stellar ages in the solar neighborhood from that caused by planet formation we can examine the metallicity scatter in young clusters .",
    "we can assume that the stars in a given stellar cluster are the same age and were formed from gas that is fairly uniform in metallicity .",
    "stars in the solar neighborhood are expected to have been been born in a variety of environments with about 10% born in ob associations which become bound open clusters @xcite .",
    "the low eccentricity orbits of the solar system planets require that the birth aggregate of the sun was less than a few thousand stars @xcite , and similar in size to the trapezium cluster .",
    "open clusters such as the hyades , with about 400 known members could have been as large as the trapezium when younger .",
    "based on the study of @xcite , we expect that short period extra solar planets should have a high probability of surviving disruption from the passage of nearby stars in open clusters .",
    "despite the fact that most stars in the solar neighborhood were formed in smaller , unbound groups , since planetary systems are likely to survive in open clusters , we can use observations of the stars in open clusters to explore the possibility that significant stellar metallicity enhancements ( pollution ) are likely to occur after a star is formed .",
    "if metallicity enhancements occur , they would occur over a fairly short timescale , @xmath7 years for the orbital migration scenario involving density waves in a gaseous disk @xcite , and @xmath8 years for the migration scenario involving scattering of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "in open clusters , planet systems should survive long enough that they could have caused metallicity enhancements . furthermore , nearby open clusters have nearly solar metallicities and so are a better match to the properties of parent stars of extra solar planets than are the stars in globular clusters which are comparatively extremely metal poor .",
    "it is difficult to envision any planet formation mechanism that would * not * cause differing amounts of metallicity pollution in different solar systems .",
    "we therefore expect a scatter in the metallicities in individual stars in any given stellar cluster .",
    "we might also expect a reduction in [ c / fe ] because the inner solar system is deficient in light elements such as carbon .",
    "however despite earlier reports , low values of [ c / fe ] are not observed in the parent stars of the short period extra solar planets @xcite . if ice rich cometary material from the outer solar system is incorporated into the star on a later timescale , it is possible that light element abundance could be restored .",
    "however this could only occur if material from the outer solar system can survive evaporation .",
    "evaporation rates are higher near the high mass and more luminous stars , however these stars , because of their lower mean densities , are also less likely to cause objects to fragment .",
    "smaller sized bodies because of their larger surface area are less likely to achieve final impact , particularly after a series of close approaches which can be caused by resonant trapping @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies of f stars in individual open clusters and moving groups have found that the metallicity scatter is small @xmath2fe / h ] @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these authors also measured no measurable variation in the [ c / fe ] ratio among all stars in all clusters studied .",
    "these studies would appear to rule out significant metallicity enhancement resulting from planet formation and subsequent planetary evolution in most stars .",
    "however the number of f stars observed in each cluster in these studies was not more than a dozen .",
    "establishing cluster membership is not always unambiguous and so the samples of stars chosen for detailed spectroscopic study were not complete .",
    "hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions have made it possible to construct hertzprung - russell diagrams of nearby clusters with unprecedented accuracy @xcite . with improved distances and a sample of 92 high fidelity cluster stars , @xcite have constructed an hr diagram with estimated errors in the log of the luminosity in solar units that average 0.030 .",
    "the high fidelity sample excludes member beyond 40pc from the cluster center , multiple stars , variable stars and stars with peculiar or uncertain parallaxes ( see section 9.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "stars were * not * excluded based on their position in the hr diagram .",
    "we show in figure 1 as data points , the difference between the positions of the stars on the hr diagram and the 630 myr evolutionary track at z=0.024 interpolated from those given as tables by @xcite .",
    "the mean difference between the track and stars is not zero .",
    "this implies that the evolutionary track is not a perfect match to the hr diagram of the cluster .",
    "it is impressive that the hr diagram is so good that the evolutionary tracks ( and associated bolometric corrections and color to effective temperature calibrations ) can be tested to the level of 0.05 in the log of the luminosity",
    ". nevertheless trends or smooth deviations from zero on this plot are not important for our study since we are primarily interested in the scatter of the points .",
    "the ages differences in the stars should be small compared to the age of the cluster , so other than observational errors , the variations in the stellar metallicities is the primary factor which would cause a scatter in the position of the points on the hr diagram about the isochrone .",
    "we see from figure 1 that the scatter off the evolution track is less than @xmath10 in the log of the luminosity compared to the mean local value .",
    "however an evolutionary track that differs by 0.1 dex in [ fe / h ] ( shown as the solid line in figure 1 ) is offset by about 0.15 in the log of the luminosity .",
    "we therefore estimate that the star to star differences in metallicity could be only as large as 0.03 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "this only a bit larger that that estimated for the solar neighborhood by @xcite , 0.02 dex corresponding to @xmath11 of accreted iron from the inner solar system .",
    "this limit for the standard deviation of 0.03 dex in [ fe / h ] , is better than that previously estimated by @xcite from less than a dozen f stars which was roughly 0.1 dex .",
    "this low level of scatter in the metallicities suggests that the gas from which the stars form is quite homogenous in metallicity .",
    "because massive stars become supernovae well before low mass stars are finished accreting",
    "this limit also suggests that nearby supernovae are not capable of substantially enriching the ism in their own nearby star forming regions .",
    "stellar isochrones are computed assuming that stars do not accrete additional high - z material after formation .",
    "compared to a star which has not accreted additional material , where would we expect such a star to lie on the hr diagram in the cluster ? to know the answer to this question we would need to calculate additional stellar evolutionary tracks from stellar models .",
    "while the properties of the radiative zone might be similar because it would have the same metallicity , and the energy transport through the convection should not be strongly affected by the opacity , the stellar atmosphere would be redder and since this sets the boundary condition for the stellar model , we do not expect the star to lie at exactly the same position on the hr diagram .",
    "we consider two possibilities : 1 ) the position in the hr diagram for a star which has accreted high - z material is similar to one that has not .",
    "2 ) there is a significant difference in the location on the hr diagram and in a direction that would distance the star off the isochrone .",
    "if the first possibility is true then we suggest that spectroscopic analyses can be used to identify candidate stars which have higher metallicities than would be expected from their position on the hr diagram .",
    "if such stars are found it would provide strong evidence that they had been polluted by high - z material after formation , and by processes associated with planet formation .",
    "if the second possibility is likely then we emphasize that the scatter from the isochrone observed in the hr diagram can be used to constrain stellar pollution scenarios . since the level of scatter has a standard deviation about 0.03 dex in [ fe / h ] the average star could only have accreted about 0.7 @xmath12 of accreted iron from the inner solar system .",
    "only a few stars remain outside the local mean in figure 1 with deviations greater than 0.05 in the log of the luminosity",
    ". however stars with short period giant planets are fairly common . in the solar neighborhood",
    "6 - 8% of solar type stars have short period giant extra solar planets @xcite . of the 92 high fidelity stars we expect @xmath13 with significantly higher metallicities .",
    "none of the stars is sufficiently off the evolutionary track that an enhancement of 0.1 - 0.2 dex could be allowed .",
    "this would suggest that no star in the hyades is likely to have metallicities enhanced by the @xmath14 of rocky material needed to account for the enhanced metallicities of the parent stars of short period extra solar planets @xcite , unless these stars happen to lie exactly on the same isochrone as their non polluted counterparts .",
    "we have checked that there is no correlation between the magnitude of the scatter in the hr diagram and the amount of lithium for the 19 f stars in the high fidelity sample of @xcite that have lithium abundances listed by @xcite ) .",
    "the observed scatter , even though it seems to peak near the lithium dip , does not seem to be obviously related to the mixing below the convection zone .",
    "we find no relation between the scatter off the isochrone and the effective temperature of the star as would be expected from a pollution model which is sensitive to the percentage of mass within the convection zone .",
    "in this letter we have used the high quality hr diagram of the hyades to place limits on the scatter in the metallicities of this cluster .",
    "we find that the scatter in [ fe / h ] has standard deviation approximately 0.03 dex .",
    "this estimate is an improvement upon previous spectroscopic estimates and suggests that open clusters are formed from gas that is homogenous in metallicity .",
    "we have introduced the possibility that the extremely low scatter from a predicted isochrone can be used to constrain stellar pollution scenarios which involve the addition of high - z material to the star from processes associated with planet formation .",
    "this can be done if stellar evolution tracks are calculated which include the addition of high - z metals after formation to see where stars lie on the hr diagram .",
    "if polluted stars lie off the isochrone for unpolluted stars then the scatter of stars in the hr diagram can be used to constrain the extent of stellar pollution .",
    "otherwise comparisons between spectroscopic measured metallicities and those estimated from the mean properties of the cluster can be used to identify stars which are likely to have been polluted by high - z material .    since few stars in young clusters",
    "have had comprehensive metallicity analyses , subsequent studies could be expanded and verified , and including more stars with a larger range of mass .",
    "care should be taken that stars with discrepant metallicities are not thrown out of the sample and assumed to be non - cluster members .",
    "currently there is no observational evidence that metallicities of different mass stars in a given cluster differ .",
    "comparison of spectroscopically measured metallicities in the hyades , pleiades and ngc 2264 between g and f stars find that the metallicities are the same within the observational uncertainties ( approximately 0.1 dex ) @xcite .    despite the fact that the ism ( along 1kpc line of sight absorption lines ) appears to have a uniform metallicity @xcite ,",
    "the metallicities of moving groups differ significantly @xcite , and the youngest ones seem to have increasingly subsolar values .",
    "there also are extremely metal rich stars some of which are not young .",
    "the high metallicity stars are kinematically related , they tend to be in moving groups or streams @xcite .",
    "this suggests that high metallicity stars are formed in clusters that are uniform in metallicity just like lower metallicity stars .",
    "this may rule out a scenario where even a few percent of stars have their metallicity increased significantly by the affects of planetary processes and would instead support a model where higher metallicity stars are more likely to harbor short period planets .",
    "however there is good evidence that one parent star of an extra solar planet has engulfed planetary material ; the detection of lithium 6 in hd 82943 @xcite .",
    "further study of uniform populations such as are found in young clusters may be able to determine the relative statistical importance of both scenarios .",
    "this work could not have been carried out without helpful discussions with don garnett , caty pilachowski , jonathan lunine , ari laor , patrick young , dave arnett , adam burrows , nadya gorlova , and mike meyer .",
