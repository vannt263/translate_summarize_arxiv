    "of buried unexploded ordnance ( uxo ) from old practice ranges is a longstanding economic and humanitarian problem .",
    "solution of the problem requires remote identification of subsurface metallic objects .",
    "the most difficult technological issue is not the detection of such targets  advanced metal detection systems , such as the nrl - temtads platform described below , easily detect even very small amounts of metal at 1 m or more depths  but rather the ability to distinguish between targets of interest and harmless clutter items , such as various sized fragments of exploded ordnance .",
    "since clutter tends to exist at much higher density , even modest discrimination ability leads to huge reductions in the economic cost of remediating such sites @xcite .",
    "formally , a successful solution to the electromagnetic ( em ) discrimination problem is an algorithm enabling accurate bounds on physical properties of the target scatterer ( position , shape , orientation , composition , etc . )  from measurements of the scattered field using a well characterized platform ( known transmitter / receiver geometry , transmitted waveform , and so on ) .",
    "solution of this inverse problem requires a search over candidate solutions to the forward problem , namely accurate forms for the scattered field from a known target in a known subsurface environment .",
    "generating high - fidelity forward solutions requires full three dimensional numerical solutions to the maxwell equations , a difficult and time consuming computational problem . to reduce the computational burden ,",
    "it is extremely important to obtain analytic solutions to as broad an array of exactly soluble model problems as possible .",
    "these solutions may then either be used as first - order models of the target , or as the basis of a perturbation scheme for accurate modeling of `` nearby '' target geometries .",
    "this paper details successful validation of our physics - based `` mean field '' and `` early time '' approaches to modeling of time - domain electromagnetic ( tdem ) responses of compact , highly conducting targets .",
    "specifically , we apply our methods to the analysis ( through both forward and inverse modeling ) of laboratory - style data collected by the nrl temtads system using artificial spheroidal targets , as well as some real uxo targets .",
    "the models use the detailed measurement platform and target parameters to generate highly numerically efficient , first principles predictions for the measured time - domain voltages .",
    "the models are designed to be essentially exact for spheroidal targets , and the remarkable agreement between measurements and predictions strongly supports this conclusion .",
    "the em response of real uxo targets is found to differ in significant ways from those of spheroids , but comparing the two provides key insights into target identification .",
    "the only compact targets for which a full analytic solution at any frequency may be derived are those with spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "these are rather poor approximations to uxo , which tend to more resemble rounded cylinders or spheroids with roughly 4:1 aspect ratio . unlike for scalar wave problems , where exact solutions can be generated also for ellipsoidal targets , the vector field maxwell equations fail to separate in ellipsoidal coordinates @xcite and fully analytic solutions do not exist .",
    "as described in more detail below , the modeling approach applied here uses simplifications available for uxo - like target shapes , and also in different target electrodynamic regimes , to generate a combined prediction that quantitatively describes the full response .",
    "we specifically consider tdem induction measurements . here",
    "the transmitter loop current pulse generates a magnetic field in the target region , and this changing applied field , especially as the pulse terminates , induces currents in the target , generating a scattered magnetic field . the decaying scattered field , following pulse termination , induces the measured voltage in the receiver loop .",
    "in such a measurement there are three different regimes that one may identify in the voltage time traces : early , intermediate , and late time . at very early time , immediately following pulse termination , the currents are confined to the immediate surface of the target .",
    "the initial diffusion of these currents into the target interior leads to a power law decay ( @xmath0 for nonferrous targets , @xmath1 for ferrous targets @xcite ) . at intermediate time , as the currents penetrate the deeper target interior , the power law crosses over to a multi - exponential decay , representing the simultaneous presence of a finite set of exponentially decaying modes @xcite .",
    "finally , at late time only the single , slowest decaying mode survives .",
    "we have developed a highly efficient combination of analytic and numerical models , based on rigorous solutions to the maxwell equations , that covers these three regimes , and the central purpose of this paper is to validate these models against laboratory data from both artificial spheroidal and real uxo targets , and to perform some inversion experiments that support their use for target discrimination .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "details of the em theory underlying the models , and their numerical implementation , has been presented elsewhere @xcite , but a basic overview is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelbg ] . in sec .",

[ sec : spheroids ] ) . in sec.[sec : inverse ] , we describe results for the inverse problem , in which various target properties are treated as unknown , and seek to extract them from the data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : realuxo ] we describe results for certain real uxo targets ( specifically , 60 mm and 81 mm mortar bodies ) .",
    "finally , conclusions and directions for future work are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our approach to the intermediate and late time regimes is based on a perturbation expansion about low frequency that takes advantage of the fact that analytic solutions for ellipsoidal targets do exist in the electrostatic limit ( where the electric and magnetic fields are gradients of scalar fields ) .",
    "based on this , we have developed a perturbation expansion about low frequency @xcite that has an extremely efficient numerical implementation .",
    "the theory is dubbed the `` mean field approach , '' since the expansion is highly nonlocal in space , with the currents and fields at any given point in the target being sensitive to their values throughout the target .",
    "although formally valid only at low frequency , the theory is extended to higher frequencies by generating a large number of terms in the series ( for a related numerical approach using an expansion in spheroidal wavefunctions , see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    for time - domain measurements",
    ", low frequency corresponds to later time , in which initial rapid transients have died away .",
    "the solution to the maxwell equations allows one to represent the electric field following pulse termination as a sum of exponentially decaying modes , @xmath2 where @xmath3 are decay rates , @xmath4 are mode shapes , and @xmath5 are excitation coefficients .",
    "the first two are intrinsic properties of the target , analogous to vibration modes of a drumhead .",
    "only the excitation amplitudes depend on the details of the measurement protocol . at early time",
    "a very large number of exponentials is present , and in fact the previously mentioned power laws arise from this large superposition ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : earlyt ] below ) .    as time progresses , modes with larger values of @xmath3 decay more quickly , and so at any given time @xmath6 the signal will be dominated by some finite set of modes , namely those modes with @xmath7 . at very late time ,",
    "@xmath8 , only the slowest decaying mode contributes , and the signal becomes a pure exponential decay .",
    "thus , the earlier in time one wishes to model quantitatively , the greater the number of modes that are required .",
    "the ultimate limitation turns out to be the rate at which the excitation in pulse is terminated .",
    "if the pulse is turned off on a time scale @xmath9 ( see sec.[sec : tx_wvfrm ] ) , then only modes with @xmath10 have substantial amplitudes @xmath5 , and a finite set of modes suffices for a full description of the target electrodynamics . for large targets , this may require many thousands , or even tens of thousands of modes , which is beyond current computational capability .",
    "however , for computational purposes it is only required that enough modes be computed that the resulting multi - exponential series overlaps the early - time regime .",
    "the early - time power law and mode descriptions may then be combined to fully describe the target dynamics over the full measured time range . for modes that decay slowly enough , hence contain low enough frequencies , the mean field approach can be used to compute them , and compute as well the excitation level of each .",
    "we will see that a few hundred modes is more than enough to attain the required overlap , and this basically serves to define the beginning of what we call the intermediate time regime .    using the mode orthogonality relation ( which follows from the maxwell equations ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the conductivity , the excitation amplitude can be determined as @xmath13 in which the transmitter loop has been approximated by an ideal 1d loop @xmath14 with @xmath15 windings , and @xmath16 depends on the history transmitter loop current @xmath17 up until the beginning of the measurement window , taken here as @xmath18 . to gain some intuition , a single perfect square wave pulse of amplitude @xmath19 and duration @xmath20 , one obtains @xmath21 for a mode that decays rapidly on the scale @xmath20",
    ", one has @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . for a more slowly decaying modes",
    ", @xmath24 will have a strong dependence on @xmath20 and @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , for large targets one may actually encounter for small enough @xmath25 the regime @xmath26 [ e.g. , @xmath27 ms and @xmath28 where @xmath24 will depend not only on @xmath20 , but on previous pulses .",
    "finally , the measured voltage takes the form @xmath29 in which , approximating the receiver as well by an ideal 1d loop @xmath30 with @xmath31 windings , the voltage amplitudes are given by the line integrals @xmath32    equations ( [ 2.3])([2.7 ] ) provide all the required ingredients for generating predicted data based on a target and measurement platform model .",
    "our `` mean field '' numerical code divides naturally into two parts .",
    "the _ internal code _ solves the maxwell equations to produce the intrinsic mode quantities @xmath3 and @xmath4 for a range of expected targets . with increasing @xmath3 ,",
    "the modes have more complex spatial structure , and finite numerical precision means that only a finite set ( a few hundred ) of slowest decaying modes are actually produced @xcite .",
    "the _ external _ code uses the mode data , along with the measurement platform data , to compute current integrals ( [ 2.4 ] ) , the line integrals in ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) , and then combines them to output the voltage amplitudes @xmath33 and hence the time series ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "note that the line integral computation requires full knowledge of the relative position and orientation of the target and platform .    for high precision",
    ", the internal code can take anywhere from minutes to hours to produce mode data for a single target .",
    "however , given this data , the external code takes at most a few seconds to produce the full predictions .",
    "precomputation and storage of a rapidly accessible database of target data is therefore essential .              for a rapidly terminated transmitter pulse , the external electric field , and induced voltage , display an early time power law divergence @xcite ( saturating at very early time only on the scale of the off - ramp time @xmath9 .",
    "the boundary between the intermediate ( multi - exponential ) and late time ( mono - exponential ) regime occurs at the diffusion time scale @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the characteristic target radius , and @xmath36 is the em diffusion constant  this is the time scale required for the initial surface currents to diffuse into the center of the target .",
    "the early time regime corresponds to times @xmath37 ( say , @xmath38 ) , beginning deep into the multi - exponential regime where many ( e.g. , hundreds of ) modes are excited . in this regime , for nonpermeable , or weakly permeable targets ( @xmath39 ) , one obtains the simple power law prediction prediction @xcite @xmath40 with all of the target and measurement parameters encompassed by the single amplitude @xmath41 , whose computation requires the solution of a certain neumann problem for the laplace equation in the space external to the target .    for permeable targets ,",
    "a new magnetic time scale @xmath42 emerges . for ferrous targets ,",
    "@xmath43 , and @xmath44 is tiny .",
    "the early time voltage then has a more complex _",
    "magnetic surface mode _ structure , @xmath45 where the @xmath46 are surface mode eigenvalues , and the mode time trace profile @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the complementary error function , interpolates between a @xmath0 power law at early - early time , @xmath49 , and a @xmath1 power law at late - early time , @xmath50 . for large ferrous targets , this latter interval is very large , and may , in fact , accurately represent the signal over nearly the entire measurement interval ( see sec.[sec : datacomp ] ) .    figure [ fig : earlyt_profiles ] illustrates the important features of the early time modeling , including the complex evolution of the surface current depth profile [ which extends @xmath51 to a function of both time and space @xcite ] that ultimately gives rise to the externally measured voltage ( [ 2.11 ] ) .",
    "the surface modes are special surface current profiles ( two such patterns are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : earlytmodes ] below ) that , instead of decaying exponentially , evolve according to the universal function @xmath51 . they and the @xmath46 are solutions to an eigenvalue problem defined on the surface of the target @xcite .",
    "they may be determined analytically only for spherical targets , where one finds @xmath52 each @xmath53-degenerate , with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the radius .",
    "the surface current patterns are controlled by the spherical harmonics of order @xmath56 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath57 again require a solution to an external laplace - neumann problem .",
    "unlike the bulk , exponential modes , under most conditions , only a very few surface modes are excited .",
    "the initial surface current pattern more - or - less follows the shape of the magnetic field generated by the transmitter coil . unless the target is close to the coil , this field is fairly uniform , and the corresponding surface current density is fairly uniform as well , and",
    "can then be represented by the first few ( two or three ) modes .",
    "there is a very heavy numerical overhead in computing these modes and their excitation amplitudes , all in pursuit of predicting the rather limited information content of just a few coefficients .",
    "given the success of extending the mean field predictions into the intermediate - early time regime , we have therefore found that it is much more efficient to extend the voltage curve by _ fitting _ the data at intermediate times to a one or two term series of the form ( [ 2.11 ] ) , estimating @xmath58 for the first few modes .",

    "these turn out to serve as an illustration of another set of inversion pitfalls one may encounter , in this case depending on how one balances prior knowledge in the presence of noisy data in the later time regime .",
    "since the early time behavior of ferrous targets is much more complicated than that for nonmagnetic targets , in addition to the crossover time @xmath142 , one must provide an appropriate parametrization of the magnetic surface mode series ( [ 2.11 ] ) and ( [ 2.12 ] ) @xcite . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : earlyt ] , replacing the series by a single term with effective parameters is found to provide the best fit . for reasons that will become evident below ,",
    "we parameterize it in the form @xmath158 where @xmath159 with @xmath146 an effective early time target radius .",
    "this parameter , derived as previously from the early time eigenvalue @xmath46 , reflects the primary length scale of the surface currents for a given mode , and decreases as @xmath25 increases and the geometric complexity of the mode increases .",

    "will be reflected in the early time data when @xmath161 is what would observed in a corresponding visual inspection of the target from the point of view of a transmitter - receiver above .",
    "correspondingly , when the target is laid with symmetry axis horizontal , @xmath161 will be exhibited when a visual inspection would clearly see both @xmath161 and @xmath160 .",
    "these observations will be confirmed by the data below .",
    "analogous to the inversion shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alinv1 ] , in fig.[fig : stinv ] we show inversions for the parameters @xmath162 with tilt angle fixed at the @xmath156 ground truth value , and @xmath163 . as can be seen , the crossover time @xmath164 ms lies in a regime where noise effects are becoming significant .",
    "in particular , in this case the noise happens to induce a sharper downturn in the signal in the multi - exponential regime than is case for the true signal . in attempt to fit this",
    ", the inversion on the left unphysically suppresses the conductivity ( @xmath165 s / m ) , and compensates with an unphysically large effective radius ( @xmath166 cm , much larger than the 2 cm half - thickness of the discus ) .",
    "this keeps the product @xmath167 in ( [ 5.5 ] ) essentially fixed , thereby maintaining a good fit in the early time regime .",
    "note that the depth @xmath168 cm also differs substantially from the 52 cm ground truth .    in order to avoid this overfit of the noise , the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : stinv ] shows the superior result obtained by fixing the conductivity at the physically reasonable value @xmath169 s / m , with the results @xmath170 cm and @xmath171 cm .",
    "the main lesson here is that significantly different information ( specifically , different combinations of conductivity with other parameters ) is contained in the early time and later time regimes for ferrous targets , and there are large parameter ambiguities in the absence of good data in both . for ferrous targets ,",
    "the more rapid @xmath1 dominant decay in early time leads to much smaller signals , hence degraded data , in the multi - exponential regime .",
    "parameters relying on the latter will therefore be more poorly determined , and one may be forced to apply a larger set of prior knowledge constraints than for nonmagnetic targets . since real uxo targets are usually ferrous , this lesson has important practical implications .",
    "we turn finally to some initial inversion results for real uxo targets , namely 60 mm and 81 mm mortar bodies , selected for their near - spheroidal shape .",
    "the former has a 6 cm diameter , and is approximately 13 cm long ; the aspect ratio is therefore taken as @xmath172 .",
    "the latter has an 8.1 cm diameter and is approximately 25 cm long ; the aspect ratio is therefore taken as @xmath173 .",
    "real uxo are not ideal spheroids , but we will see that key target discrimination information can be obtained by comparing their electromagnetic responses to those of spheroids with similar geometry .",
    "data and theoretical fits for both uxo are shown in fig.[fig : mortars ] .",
    "the most important observation is that , with the assumptions @xmath174 s / m and @xmath163 , the early time curves for the two orientations ( vertical and flat ) produce excellent fits , and estimates for the effective radius that accord very nicely with the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : stinv ] ( and fig.[fig : earlytmodes ] ) : for the vertically oriented mortars , @xmath175 cm are indeed comparable to the mortar half - lengths , while for ` flat ' mortars , @xmath176 cm are comparable to their radii .",
    "note that these inferences are independent of the target depth ( which , to leading order , affects only the amplitude @xmath177 ) .",
    "the next observation is that , contrary to the early time fit , the mean field predictions ( dashed blue and red lines in fig.[fig : mortars ] ) fail to fit the data .",
    "thus , although they provide a logical extension of the early time curves @xcite , the data follow a much more steeply decaying path .",
    "as indicated by the red and magenta dashed lines , the decay can be fit using much smaller ( by factors of 2050 ) conductivities .",
    "however , these unphysically small effective values are also unphysically orientation dependent , and give similarly inconsistent values for the overall voltage scales ( hence the @xmath178@xmath179 fudge factor multipliers listed in the figure legends ) .",
    "the origin of these modeling discrepancies is that the finite mortar shell thickness ( in the 0.51 cm range ) has not been accounted for . to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : hollowsph ] exact analytic results for a hollow sphere are shown .",
    "the results there confirm the rapid increase in the mode decay rates with decreasing shell thickness ( left panel ) , and the resulting early breakaway of the voltage curves from the early time result ( right panel ) .",
    "the breakaway time scales with the shell thickness as @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the electromagnetic diffusion constant ( see sec . [",
    "sec : earlyt ] ) . with the given values",
    ", this relation may be put in the form : @xmath182 in fig .",

    "fig : hollowsph ] ) .",
    "to summarize , the early time fits provide direct estimates of the target geometry , while the breakaway time @xmath187 away from the early time extrapolation ( as well as the solid spheroid mean field prediction ) , provide direct estimates of the uxo shell thickness .",
    "these are key parameters in target identification .",

    "however , the multi - exponential regime begins earlier for thinner - shelled targets.,width=307 ]          as described in the previous subsection , the early time prediction provides an effective orientation - dependent target radius . for a given buried target , the orientation is fixed , and one seeks other ways of extracting this information . here one may take advantage of the array degrees of freedom available with the temtads platform : each tx - rx pair effectively provides a different ` look ' at the target . in fig.[fig : multirxtx ] we show such data for @xmath107 cm oblate steel spheroid ( left panel ) , and the 81 mm mortar ( right panel ) .",
    "in each case the targets are centered ( 50 cm and 48 cm , respectively ) below rx / tx12 , with their symmetry axes vertical .",
    "see fig.[fig : temtads_array ] for the labeling .    note that if the transmitter and receiver coils were identical then , by complementarity , the tx(m)/rx(n ) response would coincide with that of tx(n)/rx(m ) .",
    "the fact that they are somewhat different ( see table [ table : temtads_array ] ) explains , for example , the small differences between the sets of green and blue curves ( e.g. , tx7/rx12 vs.  tx12/rx7 or tx17/rx12 vs.  tx12/rx17 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if two sets of rx / tx pairs are symmetrically placed relative to the ( axially symmetric ) target , then the responses should be identical ( e.g. , tx7/rx12 vs.tx11/rx12 or tx11/rx13 vs.  tx7/rx17 ) , and this is indeed observed .    to leading order ,",
    "the actual time series is a superposition of the horizontal and vertical early time magnetic surface modes ( fig.[fig : earlytmodes ] ) , and one expects that a fit to a single value of @xmath146 will then find values that interpolate between the two .",
    "this is indeed , for the most part , seen to be the case . for the combination rx12/tx12 ( red lines ) ,",
    "the effective radius is indeed comparable to the ` vertical half - height ' of the target ( 4 cm , vs.@xmath188 cm for the oblate spheroid ; 12 cm vs.@xmath189 cm for the 81 mm mortar ) .",
    "so long as either rx12 or tx12 is used ( e.g. , green and blue curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : multirxtx ] ) , @xmath146 remains comparable to ( or even larger than ) its rx12/tx12 value .",
    "for tx12 , this is because the same dominant magnetic surface mode is being excited , irrespective of which receiver is used to observe it .",
    "for rx12 the same argument proceeds through complementarity : an off - center transmitter will excite more than one surface mode , but the symmetrically placed receiver will see only the symmetrically circulating mode .",
    "however , when both transmitter and receiver are off - center ( e.g. , cyan and magenta curves in the figure ) , the effective radius is seen to become comparable to the physical ( horizontal ) radius of the target ( 10 cm for the oblate spheroid ; 4.05 cm for the mortar ) .",
    "thus , despite the fact that the overall signal levels drop precipitously as the tx - rx separation increases , to the point where the multi - exponential regime becomes unobservable @xcite , robust target geometry inferences can still be made using this data through the early - time prediction fits .",
    "it should also be noted that these fits , being restricted to the early time regime , entail adjustment of the single parameter @xmath146 ( or @xmath190 ) , and so do not require a sophisticated inversion scheme .",
    "there is one feature of the 81 mm mortar data that deserves further comment .",
    "the tx11/rx13 and tx7/rx17 ( cyan curves in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : multirxtx ] ) display an unusual cusp feature at about 0.3 ms .",
    "since the magnitude of the voltage is being plotted , this actually corresponds to a node in the response , i.e. , a sign reversal of @xmath191 .",
    "the easiest way to understand this effect is to note that a target close to tx12 will generate a net downward - pointing magnetic field through rx13 .",
    "however , as the target depth increases , the field becomes net upward - pointing , reversing the sign of the flux , and hence of the induced voltage .",
    "in this picture , a node in the response occurs as a function of target depth , but a similar argument would also produce a node as a function of time due to exchange of dominance of two early - time mode contributions .",
    "vertical variation of the applied magnetic field will always produce higher order modes ( with more complex spatial structure than those shown in fig.[fig : earlytmodes ] ) with faster decay rates , and near the critical depth the multiple contributions sum to produce a zero crossing .",
    "the results presented in this paper demonstrate the unprecedented accuracy available from our first principles , physics based models covering the entire measurement window , from the early time multi - power law regime , all the way through the multi - exponential regime to the late time mono - exponential regime .",
    "prior to the mean field code s current iteration @xcite , the number of accurately computed modes used to describe the multi - exponential regime was limited to perhaps a few dozen @xcite . as seen in the results presented , by generating the required overlap of the early time and multi - exponential regimes ,",
    "this improvement is critical to the success of the validation and inversion tests .",
    "it should be emphasized that the increase in predictive power continues to operate with extremely high numerical efficiency .",
    "the creation of the mode data for a given target can not be performed in real time , but once this data is made available in a database that spans the expected target geometries , its acquisition and use for measurement predictions can be performed in real time  operating at essentially the same speed as predictions using the exact solution for the sphere .    as seen in the figures ,",
    "the dominant regimes visible in the data depend very strongly on the target size and physical properties . increasing",
    "target size and magnetic permeability expands the early time regime to later physical time .",
    "smaller aluminum targets ( e.g. , blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : alprolate ] ) are completely described by the mean field approach over the full time range , while even the smaller steel targets barely enter multi - exponential regime ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : stprolate ] and [ fig : stoblate ] ) before the signal fades into the noise floor @xcite .    through investigation of inversions",
    "it has been shown that different time regimes and different tx / rx pairs contain complementary target discrimination information .",
    "the most exciting development is the observation that the early time regime , which dominates the steel target response , contains direct information about the target geometry ( via the different effective target diameters seen from different ` look angles ' ) and the hollow target shell thickness ( through the earlier breakaway time to multi - exponential decay for thinner shelled targets ) .",
    "these are key features that will support target identification and clutter rejection .",
    "all of these features , whose quantitative interpretation is enabled by the present models , can be applied to the pursuit of robust target discrimination and identification under more challenging conditions .",
    "the code efficiency becomes especially critical for this purpose , as searches through the database for the target whose response best matches the data requires hundreds , or perhaps even thousands , of iterations . in the inversion results presented",

    "so the depth - to - center varies with orientation : between 26 cm ( horizontal target ) and 21 cm ( vertical target ) for the former ; between 27 cm ( vertical target ) and 21 cm ( horizontal target ) for the latter .    in principle",
    ", the exact amplitude of @xmath193 could be computed from first principles using the early - time theory @xcite , but this would necessitate significant computational effort in pursuit of a single coefficient .",
    "simultaneous inversions of multiple time series would probably remove most of this particular ambiguity , since different tx - rx pairs provide different ` looks ' at a target that vary significantly relative to one another with depth .",
    "this will be a subject of future work .",
    "target orientation , of course , is determined by the azimuthal angle @xmath194 as well . however , for a target centered under the tx / rx coil , the dependence on @xmath194 is extremely weak ( and would be nonexistent for circular coils ) , and is therefore treated as fixed at the experimental value ( along the line joing the centers of rx / tx10 and rx / tx/14see fig .",
    "[ fig : temtads_array ] ) .",
    "simultaneous inversions of multiple tx - rx pairs would effectively remove this ambiguity as well ( cf . footnote @xcite ) .",
    "note that for the targets lying flat , the estimated target depths lie only 2 cm from their ground truth values , while for vertical targets there are much larger ( 7.5 cm and 5 cm ) discrepancies .",
    "one possible reason for this is the signicant nose - tail asymmetry of the mortars , which will generally bias the effective spheroid center away from the target geometric center .",
    "though , for the 81 mm mortar this regime begins earlier , and the accompanying breakaway time @xmath187 , equation ( [ 6.1 ] ) , continues to be apparent in a number of the voltage traces in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : multirxtx ] .",
    "this signal fading is exacerbated by the more rapid @xmath1 decay of the late - early time signal for steel targets , as compared to the much slower @xmath0 aluminum targets .",
    "the latter then have greater tendency to maintain strong signals into the multi - exponential regime ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : alprolate ] and [ fig : aloblate ] ) . as decribed in sec .",
    "[ sec : earlyt ] ( see especially fig .",
    "[ fig : earlyt_profiles ] ) , this more rapid decay has its orgin in the surface current dynamics , which , in magnetic targets , tends to more quickly push the currents away from the target surface ."
