    "since the longtime behavior of the super random walk , stepping stone model , mutually catalytic branching model and parabolic anderson model is very different , one might guess that the parameter space @xmath56 $ ] can be divided into disjoint subsets corresponding to different regimes .",

    "finally , in section [ sec : wavespeed ] we show how to use the results of section [ sec : moments ] to strengthen the main result of @xcite .",
    "before stating the main results , we briefly recall from @xcite that the state space of @xmath61 is given by pairs of tempered functions , that is , pairs of functions contained in @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and we think of @xmath64 as being topologized by the metric given in @xcite , equation ( 13 ) , yielding a polish space .",
    "the state space for @xmath33 is similar .",
    "it was not discussed in @xcite and so we present details in section [ sec : bpd ] .",

    "in particular , the proposition shows ultimate extinction of one species in law .",
    "[ all ] for simplicity , proposition [ prop : convlaw ] is formulated for constant initial conditions even though the result holds more generally .",

    "the proof of @xcite can also be applied to @xmath88 and , thus , proposition [ prop : convlaw ] holds in the same way for initial distributions @xmath89 .",
    "the restriction to @xmath66 arises from our method of proof which exploits a self - duality of the process which gives no information for @xmath90 .",
    "let us briefly discuss the behavior of the limiting distributions in the boundary cases @xmath91 which are well known in the literature and fit neatly into our result .",
    "first , suppose @xmath92 is a solution of the stepping stone model ( see example [ ex1 ] ) and @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that @xmath94 where @xmath95 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath96 ) denotes the dirac distribution concentrated on the constant function @xmath97 ( resp . , @xmath98 ) .",
    "this can be reformulated in terms of perfectly anti - correlated brownian motions @xmath99 as before : for @xmath43 , the pair @xmath99 takes values only on the straight line connecting @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and stops at the boundaries .",
    "hence , the law of @xmath102 is a mixture of @xmath103 and @xmath104 and the probability of hitting @xmath101 is equal to the probability of a one - dimensional brownian motion started in @xmath105 $ ] hitting @xmath106 before @xmath107 , which is @xmath52 , and hence matches ( [ eq : shigalimit ] ) .",
    "second , let @xmath92 be a solution of the parabolic anderson model with brownian potential ( see example [ ex2 ] ) and constant initial condition @xmath108 . in @xcite it was shown that @xmath109 as discussed above , when viewed as a symbiotic branching process with @xmath16 , this implies @xmath110 from the viewpoint of two perfectly positive - correlated brownian motions , we obtain the same result since they simple move on the diagonal dissecting the upper right quadrant until they eventually get absorbed in the origin , that is , @xmath111 almost surely .    to summarize",
    ", we have seen that the weak longtime behavior ( in the recurrent case ) of the classical models connected to symbiotic branching is appropriately described by correlated brownian motions hitting the boundary of the upper right quadrant .",
    "in contrast to extinction in law , the almost - sure behavior is very different . in the recurrent case for the mutually catalytic branching model , cox and klenke",
    "@xcite showed that , almost surely , there is no longtime local extinction of any type , but in fact the locally predominant type changes infinitely often .",
    "it is not hard to see that the same is true for symbiotic branching with @xmath66 .",
    "we do not give a proof since it follows from proposition [ prop : convlaw ] along the same lines as in @xcite .",
    "[ prop : pb ] let @xmath66 , @xmath67 and suppose @xmath65 is a spatial symbiotic branching process in the recurrent case with initial distribution @xmath68 . then",

    "note that proposition [ prop : pb ] depends strongly on the spatial structure since in the nonspatial model almost sure convergence holds ( see proposition [ prop : sconv ] ) .",
    "in @xcite the second moments of symbiotic branching processes are analyzed .",
    "this particular case admits a detailed study since a moment duality ( see lemma [ la : mdual ] ) has a particularly simple structure which allows one to reduce the study of the moments to that of moment generating functions and laplace transforms of local times .",
    "here we are interested in the behavior of moments as @xmath118 tends to infinity .",
    "the two available dualities ( self - duality and moment duality ) are combined in two steps .",
    "first , a self - duality argument combined with an equivalence between bounded moments of the exit time distribution and of the exit point distribution for correlated brownian motions stopped on exiting the first quadrant is used to understand the effect of @xmath54 .",
    "it turns out that for any @xmath119 there are critical values , independent of @xmath40 , dividing regimes in which the moments @xmath120 $ ] , @xmath121 $ ] and @xmath122 $ ] are bounded in @xmath118 or grow to infinity .",
    "second , for @xmath123 , a perturbation argument combined with the first step and a moment duality is used to analyze the growth to infinity in more detail .",
    "the following critical curve captures the effect of @xmath54 .",
    "note that the definition is independent of @xmath40 which will become important in the second step .",

    "coming back to the symbiotic branching model , we ask whether or not the @xmath151th lyapunov exponents @xmath158\\ ] ] exist and in which cases @xmath159 is strictly positive . as for the parabolic anderson model ,",
    "there is a system of partial differential equations describing the moments ( see proposition 16 of @xcite for the continuous - space model ) and an @xmath151-particle path - integral representation of the moments .",
    "in addition to the independent motion , the particles now carry a color which randomly changes if particles of the same color stay at the same site ( see lemma [ la : mdual ] ) . with @xmath160 denoting collision times of particles of same color and @xmath161 denoting collision times of particles of different colors , the path - integral representation of moments reads @xmath162={\\mathbb{e}}\\bigl[e^{\\kappa(l_t^=+\\varrho l_t^{\\neq } ) } \\bigr].\\ ] ] this representation is more involved than the path - integral representation for the parabolic anderson model since , in addition to the motion of particles , a second stochastic mechanism is included .",

    "it is natural that in the transient case perturbing the critical case does not immediately yield exponential growth , whereas perturbing the recurrent case does immediately lead to exponential growth .",
    "it is clear that in the transient case the gap in ( iii ) of theorem [ thm :",
    "im ] is really necessary : for small @xmath40 moments of the parabolic anderson model are bounded . since moments of symbiotic branching are dominated by moments of the parabolic anderson model ( see lemma [ la : mdual ] ) , for small @xmath40 moments are bounded for all @xmath54 .",
    "in the case @xmath172 there seems to be no reason why exponential growth should fail .",
    "unfortunately , in this case there is no moment duality and hence the most useful tool to analyze exponential growth is not available .",
    "[ conj:1 ] in the recurrent case the moment diagram for symbiotic branching ( figure [ fig : cl ] ) describes the moments as follows : pairs @xmath173 below the critical curve correspond precisely to bounded moments , pairs at the critical curve correspond to moments which grow subexponentially fast to infinity and pairs above to the critical curve correspond to exponentially growing moments .    a deeper understanding of the lyapunov exponents as functions of @xmath174 remains mainly open ( for an upper bound see proposition [ up ] ) . for second moments",
    "[ @xmath129 ] this is carried out in @xcite .",
