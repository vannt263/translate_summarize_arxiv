    "in recent years , the modeling of nanoscale physics has become important , both because of industrial applications  @xcite , and because of the development of experiments that probe these small scales  @xcite .",
    "one particular problem is the modeling of aggregation , in which microscopic particles collapse under the potential they exert on each other , and form mesoscopic structures that in turn behave like particles .    in a series of papers , holm , putkaradze and tronci",
    "@xcite have focused on the derivation of aggregation equations that possess emergent singular solutions .",
    "continuum aggregation equations have been used to model gravitational collapse and the subsequent emergence of stars  @xcite , the localization of biological populations  @xcite , and the self - assembly of nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "these are complexes of atoms or molecules that form mesoscale structures with particle - like behavior .",
    "the utility of the holm ",
    "putkaradze model lies in its emphasis on non - local physics , and the emergence of singular solutions from smooth initial data . because of the singular ( delta - function ) behavior of the model",
    ", it is an appropriate way to describe the universal phenomena of aggregation and the subsequent formation of particle - like structures . indeed in this framework",
    ", it is possible to prescribe the dynamics of the particle - like structures after collapse .",
    "thus , the model provides a description of directed self - assembly in nanophysics  @xcite , in which the detailed physics is less important than the effective medium properties of the dynamics .    in this work we focus on equations introduced by holm , putkaradze and tronci for the aggregation of oriented particles  @xcite .",
    "we treat the initial state of the system as a continuum , a good approximation in nanophysics applications  @xcite .",
    "one realization of this problem is in nanomagnetics , in which particles with a definite magnetic moment collapse and form mesoscale structures , that in turn have a definite magnetic moment .",
    "thus , in this paper we refer to the orientation vector in our continuum picture as the _ magnetization_. we investigate these equations numerically and study their evolution and aggregation properties .",
    "one aspect of non - local problems , already mentioned in  @xcite , is the effect of competition between the length scales of non - locality on the system evolution .",
    "we shall highlight this effect with a linear stability analysis of the full density - magnetization equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : mag_dens ] we introduce a coupled density - magnetization system that generates singular solutions .",
    "we examine the competition of length scales through a linear stability analysis and through the study of the dynamical equations for a simple singular solution that describes the interaction of two particle - like objects ( clumpons ) .",
    "we perform numerical simulations that highlight the emergence of singular solutions from smooth initial data .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sec .  [",

    "in this section we study a magnetization equation that in form is similar to the gilbert equation , that is , the landau  lifshitz  gilbert equation in the over - damped limit  @xcite .",
    "the equation we focus on incorporates non - local effects , and was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we study the evolution and energetics of this equation , and examine the importance of the problem length scales in determining the evolution .",
    "we study the following non - local gilbert ( ng ) equation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the magnetization density , @xmath2 is the mobility , defined as @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the variational derivative of the energy , @xmath5 the smoothened magnetization @xmath2 and the force @xmath6 can be computed using the theory of green s functions . in particular",

    "the initial conditions for the magnetization vector are chosen to represent the lack of a preferred direction in the problem .",
    "the time evolution of equations   for this set of initial conditions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution_ic2 ] . after a short time , the initial data become singular , and subsequently , the solution @xmath62 can be represented as a sum of clumpons , @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the number of clumpons present at the singularity time .",

    "the forces exerted by each clumpon on the other balance because of the effect of the periodic boundary conditions . indeed , any number of equally - spaced , identical , interacting particles arranged on a ring are in equilibrium , although this equilibrium is unstable for an attractive force .",
    "thus , at late times , the clumpons are stationary , while the magnetization vector @xmath65 shows alignment of clumpon magnetizations .",
    "we gain further understanding of the formation of singular solutions by studying the system velocity @xmath66 just before the onset of the singularity .",

    "[ fig : snapshot_ic2 ] . figure  [ fig : snapshot_ic2 ]  ( a ) shows the development of the two clumpons from the initial data . across each density maximum",
    ", the velocity has the profile @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is an increasing function of time .",
    "this calls to mind the advection problem for the scalar @xmath69 , studied by batchelor in the context of passive - scalar mixing  @xcite @xmath70 given initial data @xmath71 , the solution evolves in time as @xmath72 so that gradients are amplified exponentially in time , @xmath73 in a similar manner to the problem studied .",
    "the evolution of the set of initial conditions   has therefore demonstrated the following : the local velocity @xmath66 is such that before the onset of the singularity , matter is compressed into regions where @xmath74 is large , to such an extent that the matter eventually accumulates at isolated points , and the singular solution emerges .",
    "moreover , the density maxima , rather than the magnetization extrema , drive the formation of singularities .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the attractive part of the system s energy comes from density variations .    to highlight the interaction between clumpons ,",
    "we examine the following set of initial conditions , @xmath75 where @xmath61 is the fundamental wave number .",
    "since this set of initial conditions contains a large number of density maxima , we expect a large number of closely - spaced clumpons to emerge , and this will illuminate the clumpon interactions . the time evolution of equations   for this set of initial conditions is shown in fig .  [ fig : evolution_ic1 ] .",
    "as before , the solution becomes singular after a short time , and is subsequently represented by a sum of clumpons , @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the number of clumpons at the singularity time .",
    "this number corresponds to the number of maxima in the initial density profile .",
    "as before , this configuration of equally spaced , identical clumpons is an equilibrium state , due to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , once the particle - like state has formed , we impulsively shift the clumpon at @xmath78 by a small amount , and precipitate the merging of clumpons .",
    "the eight clumpons then merge repeatedly until only a single clumpon remains .",
    "the tendency for the clumpons to merge is explained by the velocity @xmath66 , which changes sign across a clumpon .",
    "thus , if a clumpon is within the range of the force exerted by its neighbours , the local velocity , if unbalanced , will advect a given clumpon    in the direction of one of its neighbours , and the clumpons merge .",
    "this process is shown in fig .",

    "the velocity @xmath79 flows into each density maximum , concentrating matter at isolated points and precipitating the formation of eight equally - spaced identical clumpons . on a periodic domain ,",
    "such an arrangement is an equilibrium state , although it is unstable .",

    "we have investigated the non - local gilbert ( ng ) equation introduced by holm , putkaradze , and tronci in  @xcite using a combination of numerical simulations and simple analytical arguments .",
    "the ng equation contains two competing length scales of non - locality : there is a length scale @xmath80 associated with the range of the interaction potential , and a length scale @xmath81 that governs the smoothened magnetization vector that appears in the equation .",
    "when @xmath44 all initial configurations of the magnetization tend to a constant value ; while for @xmath82 the initial configuration of the magnetization field develops finer and finer scales .",
    "these two effects are in balance when @xmath83 , and the system does not evolve away from its initial state . furthermore , the ng equation conserves the norm of the magnetization vector @xmath1 , thus providing a pointwise bound on the solution and preventing the formation of singular solutions .    to study the formation of singular solutions , we couple the ng equation to a scalar density equation . associated with the scalar density",
    "is a negative energy of attraction that drives the formation of singular solutions and breaks the pointwise bound on the @xmath1 .",
    "three length scales of non - locality now enter into the problem : the range of the force associated with the scalar density , the range of the force due to the magnetization , and the smoothening length .",
    "as before , the competition of length scales is crucial to the evolution of the system ; this is seen in the linear stability analysis of the coupled equations , in which the relative magnitude of the length scales determines the stability or otherwise of a constant state .    using numerical simulations ,",
    "we have demonstrated the emergence of singular solutions from smooth initial data , and have explained this behavior by the negative energy of attraction produced by the scalar density .",
    "the singular solution consists of a weighted sum of delta functions , given in eq .  , which we interpret as interacting particles or clumpons .",
    "the clumpons evolve under simple finite - dimensional dynamics .",
    "we have shown that a system of two clumpons is governed by a two - dimensional dynamical system that has a multiplicity of steady states .",
    "depending on the length scales of non - locality and the clumpon weights , the two clumpons can merge , diverge , or align and remain separated by a fixed distance .",
