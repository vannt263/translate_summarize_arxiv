    "recently , intensive experimental and theoretical efforts have been concentrated on the physics of electron spin due to the enormous potential of spin based devices . in these so called `` spintronic '' devices,@xcite information",
    "is encoded in the spin state of individual electrons , transferred with the electrons , and finally put under measurement .",
    "electron spin states relax , i.e. , depolarize , by scattering with imperfections or elementary excitations such as other carriers and phonons . therefore , to realize any useful spintronic devices , it is essential to understand and have control over spin relaxation such that the information is not lost before a required operation is completed .",
    "the investigation of spin relaxation has a long history dating back to the fifties and most studies have concentrated on iii - v semiconductors since direct measurement of spin relaxation time is possible through optical orientation in these materials .",
    "three main spin relaxation mechanisms , the elliot - yafet@xcite ( ey ) , dyakonov - perel@xcite ( dp ) and bir - aronov - pikus@xcite ( bap ) mechanism have been suggested and confirmed experimentally .",
    "earlier works for spin relaxation are mainly on bulk systems such as @xmath1-gaas,@xcite @xmath1-gasb,@xcite gaalas@xcite and @xmath0-insb.@xcite more recently , spin relaxation has also been investigated in quantum well structures ( gaas,@xcite gaassb,@xcite ingaas / ingaasp@xcite and gaas / algaas@xcite ) as well as in bulk systems ( @xmath0-gaas@xcite and inas@xcite ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "there are recent approaches which refine or extend the original calculations of refs .  3 and 4 to explain newly obtained experimental results .",
    "flatt and coworkers@xcite employed a nonperturbative 14-band calculation for the dp mechanism both for bulk and quantum well structures and achieved a better agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the bap process was reconsidered through a direct monte carlo simulation and extended to quantum wells by maialle and coworkers.@xcite    in the most studies , the strategy has been to find the relevant spin relaxation mechanism by comparing experimental results for spin relaxation time , @xmath2 , with theoretically predicted dependence on temperature or doping concentrations .",
    "based upon these results , a  phase diagram \"- like picture showing the dominant spin relaxation mechanism can be constructed to provide a comprehensive global understanding for competition of spin relaxation mechanisms .",
    "however , since available experimental results for @xmath2 are usually limited to a narrow range of external physical parameters except some intensively investigated materials , such pictures are currently available only for @xmath1-gaas and @xmath1-gasb.@xcite    in this paper , we calculate the electron spin relaxation time for the ey ( @xmath3 ) , the dp ( @xmath4 ) and the bap ( @xmath5 ) processes for several bulk iii - v semiconductors : gaas , gasb , inas and insb of both @xmath0- and @xmath1-type .",
    "our result for @xmath2 is based upon theoretical calculation of the momentum relaxation time , @xmath6 .",
    "a diagram is constructed illustrating the dominant spin relaxation processes as a function of temperature and impurity concentration for each material .",
    "the resulting ",
    "phase diagrams \" for @xmath1-gaas and @xmath1-gasb are in qualitative agreement with that of an earlier study.@xcite the diagrams for the other materials considered in this work were not available in the literature and represent an attempt to provide a better understanding of interplay between various factors for @xmath2 .",
    "we also discuss some incomplete aspects of the current theories for spin relaxation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the basic formulation of the three spin relaxation mechanisms is briefly described .",
    "the details of our calculation for the momentum relaxation time ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath2 are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv the results for @xmath2 are compared with available experimental results and the  phase diagrams \" for dominant spin relaxation is constructed .",
    "the conclusion follows in sec .",
    "the ey mechanism originates from the fact that in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , the exact bloch state is not a spin eigenstate but a superposition of them .",
    "this induces a finite probability for spin flip when the spatial part of electron wavefunction experiences a transition through scattering even if the involved interaction is spin independent.@xcite the spin relaxation time is given by@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the band gap and @xmath9 with the spin - orbit splitting of the valence band @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is a dimensionless constant and varies from 2 to 6 depending on dominant scattering mechanism for momentum relaxation .      in iii - v semiconductors , the degeneracy in the conduction band",
    "is lifted for @xmath12 due to the absence of inversion symmetry .",
    "the resulting energy difference for electrons with the same @xmath13 but different spin states plays the role of an effective magnetic field and results in spin precession with angular velocity @xmath14 during the time between collisions .",
    "since the magnitude and the direction of @xmath13 changes in an uncontrolled way due to electron scattering with impurities and excitations , this process contributes to spin relaxation .",
    "this is called the dp mechanism@xcite and @xmath4 is given by@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a dimensionless factor and ranges @xmath17 depending on the dominant momentum relaxation process .",
    "@xmath18 is the parameter characterizing the @xmath19-term for conduction band electrons and is approximately given by @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the effective mass of the conduction electron and the electron rest mass , respectively .",
    "electron spin flip transition is also possible by electron - hole scattering via exchange and annihilation interactions .",
    "this is called the bap mechanism and is especially strong in @xmath1-type semiconductors due to high hole concentrations .",
    "@xmath5 is given by several different expressions depending on the given external parameters .",
    "in the case of a nondegenerate semiconductor@xcite ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the concentration of free ( bound ) holes and @xmath27 is the critical hole concentration between degeneracy and nondegeneracy .",
    "@xmath28 is the conduction electron energy and @xmath29 is given by the relation @xmath30 with @xmath31 the exchange splitting of the exciton ground state .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reduced mass of electron and hole , @xmath36 the bohr radius ( @xmath37 0.53  ) and @xmath38 the rydberg constant ( @xmath37 13.6 ev ) .",

    "we first calculate the momentum relaxation time @xmath6 . we include contributions from the polar optical phonon scattering ( @xmath47 ) , ionized impurity scattering ( @xmath48 ) , piezoelectric scattering ( @xmath49 ) , and acoustic phonon deformation potential scattering ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "our calculation of @xmath6 is performed with three simplifying assumptions : + ( a ) the classical boltzmann statistics is assumed for conduction electrons , + ( b ) the electrons are scattered in a parabolic band , + ( c ) the mathiessen s rule is applied so that @xmath51 .",

    "figure 1 plots the results of mobility calculation , @xmath83 , for @xmath0-gaas and @xmath0-inas .",
    "good agreement is obtained with the published result of rode and knight@xcite for @xmath0-gaas while our result for @xmath0-inas shows a larger discrepancy up to @xmath8450% with those of rode@xcite .",
    "this seems to result from the fact that the nonparabolicity of conduction band , which we neglected , is stronger in inas .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the dominant momentum relaxation mechanism for @xmath0-gaas as a function of temperature and impurity concentration .",
    "it is found that the contribution from the polar optical phonon scattering is dominant for the high - t and lightly - doped regime , while the ionized impurity scattering dominates otherwise .",
    "the same qualitative features are found for all other materials investigated , both for @xmath0- and @xmath1-type .    as was noted previously ,",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath4 include dimensionless factors , i.e. , @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ ey ] ) and @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) , which vary depending on the dominant momentum relaxation process . at the current stage , it is not clear how the crossover behavior is given quantitatively when there is a switch between two momentum relaxation processes .",
    "therefore , we fix the dimensionless constants to their median values , i.e. , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this introduces @xmath8450 % uncertainty in our result for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "one might correct this error by directly looking into the dominant momentum relaxation process .    to calculate @xmath5",
    ", we first need to identify the adequate regime for a given parameter set .",
    "@xmath27 is determined by the mott criterion@xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "the thermal averaged value of @xmath89 is obtained as @xmath90 assuming a classical boltzmann distribution for conduction electrons . on the other hand , the expressions for @xmath91 and @xmath92 in eqs .",
    "( [ ey ] ) and ( [ dp ] ) are after thermal averaging with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "a difficulty with the calculation of @xmath5 lies in the fact that there is no reliable data for @xmath31 , on which @xmath5 has the dependence of @xmath93 , for @xmath1-inas and @xmath1-insb .",
    "therefore , we examine the tendency of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath31 as well .",
    "we first compare the relative importance of each spin relaxation mechanism .",
    "figure  3 shows the dominant spin relaxation processes for @xmath0-type gaas , gasb , inas and insb . for @xmath0-type semiconductors ,",
    "the contribution of the bap mechanism is negligible since the equilibrium hole concentration is extremely small .",
    "therefore , we watch the competition between the ey and the dp processes . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , it turns out that for all materials investigated there exists a transition from the dp - dominant regime to the ey - dominant regime at @xmath945 k as the temperature is lowered .",
    "these results are consistent with the previously published results that the dp process is the relevant spin relaxation mechanism for @xmath0-gaas@xcite and @xmath0-inas@xcite at high temperature of 300 k and that the ey process is relevant for @xmath0-insb at low temperature of t = 1.3 k.@xcite when the acceptor , i.e. , the minority impurity , concentration decreases , we find that the dp - dominant regime enlarges .",
    "this can be understood from following consideration .",
    "the acceptors in @xmath0-type materials are always ionized and the decrease in the acceptor concentration corresponds to the decrease in the number of scattering centers for ionized impurity scattering procedure , which is the main momentum relaxation mechanism at low temperature . therefore , a larger @xmath6 results as the acceptor concentration decreases and this induces a larger @xmath3 and a smaller @xmath4 since @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the diagrams for @xmath1-type materials are illustrated in fig .  4 with @xmath97 @xmath82 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath82 and @xmath100 @xmath82 .",
    "for @xmath1-type materials , no systematic changes are found when the minority carrier concentration is varied . for @xmath1-gaas and @xmath1-gasb , we find that the bap ( dp ) is dominant in the low - t ( high - t ) and high ( low ) doping regime .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the results of aronov _",
    "et al._,@xcite in which diagrams of the same idea were constructed based on experimental results . for @xmath1-inas , a similar feature to those of @xmath1-gaas and @xmath1-gasb is found for @xmath31 = 10 ev , and as @xmath31 decreases , the bap dominant regime becomes smaller . for @xmath1-insb , we obtain similar results to those for @xmath1-inas as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "figure  4(d ) shows the case of @xmath101 0.2 ev where a bap - dominant regime exits at @xmath102 100 k and intermediate doping concentrations .",
    "we find abrupt discontinuities in @xmath5 at @xmath103 , which results in unphysical sharp cusps at @xmath104 @xmath82 in fig .",
    "this is an artifact resulting from the fact that no quantitative expression for @xmath89 is available for the crossover between nondegenerate [ eq .",
    "( [ bap1 ] ) ] and degenerate [ eq .",
    "( [ bap2 ] ) ] hole regimes .",
    "experimentally , it was found that there exists an intermediate regime at @xmath105 where @xmath2 remains nearly flat with respect to the change in @xmath106 and that the range of such intermediate regime varies depending on the material.@xcite    figures  5 and 6 provide the total spin relaxation time , i.e. , @xmath107 for @xmath0-type and @xmath108 for @xmath1-type , respectively .",
    "@xmath2 ranges from 1 ps to 100 ns for @xmath0-type materials and from 0.1 ps to 10 ns for @xmath1-type materials , respectively , over the parameter space shown in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "for @xmath0-type materials , @xmath2 increases as @xmath109 decreases with the longest @xmath2 found at @xmath110 @xmath82 instead of in purer materials .",
    "this is because the regime shown in fig .",
    "5 is dominated solely by the dp - process and @xmath92 , which is proportional to @xmath6 , increases as the impurity concentration decreases .",
    "the same qualitative feature has also been found in a recent experiment.@xcite in our result for @xmath0-gaas , @xmath2 ranges from 5 ns to 60 ns for @xmath109 = 25 k , which gives a reasonable agreement with the experimental result of ref .",
    "19 ( @xmath111 70 ns at @xmath109 = 20 k ) . as for @xmath0-inas with @xmath112 @xmath82 and @xmath109 = 300 k ,",
    "our result gives @xmath2 = 12 ps which compares very well with a recent experimental result of @xmath113 ps.@xcite    at lower temperature , we find a discrepancy with recent experimental result for @xmath0-gaas . in experiment@xcite @xmath114 100 ns at 5 k for @xmath112 @xmath82",
    "was reported , while our result predicts a larger value of @xmath115 ns .",
    "reference .",
    "19 suggested that the main spin relaxation at this low temperature regime is due to the ey mechanism .",
    "according to our result , however , since @xmath116 1 ps and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are given by @xmath117 ns and @xmath118 ns , respectively , neither the ey nor the dp mechanism provides a satisfactory explanation for the experimental result .",
    "very recently , in ref .  20 , spin relaxation time of 290 @xmath119 30 ns at 4.2 k was reported for bound electrons to donors in @xmath0-gaas and the relevant spin relaxation mechanism was proposed to be the hyperfine interaction with nuclei,@xcite which was not taken into account in our current work . a further research incorporating this effect",
    "is needed to resolve the discrepancy between our result and the experimental result of ref .",
    "19 .    in @xmath1-type materials , smaller @xmath2 , i.e. , stronger spin relaxation rate , than that in @xmath0-type materials is found due to the effect of the bap process .",
    "the strong discontinuities at @xmath120 are also noticeable in fig .  6 due to the incompleteness of the bap expressions given by eqs .",
    "( [ bap1 ] ) and ( [ bap2 ] ) , as mentioned earlier .",
    "in this paper , we calculated theoretically @xmath2 for several bulk iii - v semiconductors and compared the contributions from the three main spin relaxation mechanisms as a function of temperature and donor / acceptor concentrations . in @xmath0-type materials , the dp mechanism is found to be dominant down to very low temperature , below which the ey mechanism dominates .",
    "while our calculated spin relaxation times are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results for high temperature regime of @xmath12120 k , there exists a discrepancy at @xmath122 5 k for @xmath0-gaas .",
    "further theoretical efforts incorporating other spin relaxation mechanisms neglected in this paper are needed for its resolution . as for @xmath1-type materials , the bap ( dp ) mechanism is dominant at low ( high ) temperature and high ( low ) acceptor concentrations .",
    "we find that the crossover between various regimes for spin relaxation requires a further theoretical investigation for a more thorough understanding and realistic comparison with experimental data .",
