    "= 0.06 @xmath12 , the original iufsu model predicts a rod phase , while the model with @xmath86 mev has undergone the crust - core transition .",
    "the transition from slab to tube occurs at @xmath54 @xmath87 0.079 @xmath12 in the original iufsu model , and , therefore , sudden changes in the density distributions are observed by comparing the third and fourth panels ; these cause visible jumps in chemical potentials and @xmath73 as shown above .",
    "as one can see , from top to bottom , the distributions of neutrons and protons become more diffuse with increasing @xmath54 , and the neutron density difference between the liquid phase and the gas phase becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "the crust - core transition occurs at @xmath54 @xmath87 0.092 @xmath12 in the original iufsu model .",
    "finally , we discuss the correlation between the symmetry energy slope @xmath2 and the crust - core transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig:9pt ] , we display the crust - core transition density @xmath88 and the proton fraction and the pressure at the transition point , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , as a function of @xmath2 obtained from the self - consistent tf calculation using the two sets of generated models based on the tm1 and iufsu parametrizations . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:9pt](a ) , there is a clear correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath88 ; namely , @xmath88 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this correlation is consistent with those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . compared to the results obtained using the cp method  @xcite , the transition densities obtained from the present tf calculation are slightly higher , which may be related to the differences in configuration space and treatments of surface and coulomb energies . from fig .",
    "[ fig:9pt](b ) , it is seen that @xmath89 decreases significantly with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this trend is very similar to that observed in refs .",
    "it can be understood from the density dependence of @xmath11 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1esym ] .",
    "as mentioned above , a smaller @xmath2 in one set of generated models corresponds to a larger @xmath0 at @xmath78 0.11 @xmath12 , and a larger @xmath0 favors a higher @xmath73 in homogeneous @xmath34-equilibrium matter .",
    "therefore , a smaller @xmath2 results in a larger @xmath89 as illustrated in fig .  [ fig:9pt](b ) .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of the transition pressure @xmath90 is nonmonotonic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9pt](c ) .",
    "it is found that @xmath90 decreases with increasing @xmath2 in the large-@xmath2 region ( @xmath91 mev ) , whereas the opposite behavior is observed for @xmath92 mev .",
    "a similar behavior was also observed in ref .",
    "the nontrivial @xmath2 dependence of @xmath90 is due to a competing effect , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for neutron - rich matter at fixed density and proton fraction ,",
    "the pressure would increase with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "however , the decrease of @xmath88 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9pt](a ) leads to a decrease of the pressure with increasing @xmath2 . as a result , @xmath90 depends on @xmath2 nonmonotonically , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:9pt](c ) .",
    "in this study , we have investigated the impact of the symmetry energy on pasta phase properties within the self - consistent tf approximation .",
    "it has been found that the symmetry energy slope @xmath2 plays an important role in determining the pasta phase structure and the crust - core transition . in order to clarify the influence of @xmath2 , we have employed two sets of generated models based on the tm1 and iufsu parametrizations that have the same isoscalar saturation properties and fixed symmetry energy at the density @xmath54 = 0.11 @xmath12 but have different symmetry energy slope @xmath2 .",
    "it has been observed that the model with a smaller @xmath2 predicts an earlier onset of nonspherical nuclei and a later transition to homogeneous matter .",
    "for example , the original iufsu model with @xmath63 mev predicts that the transition from droplet to rod occurs at @xmath54 @xmath87 0.049 @xmath12 , then the pasta phases of slab , tube , and bubble appear one by one , and finally the transition to homogeneous matter occurs at @xmath54 @xmath87 0.092 @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast , the original tm1 model with @xmath64 mev predicts that only the droplet configuration appears at low density , and the transition from droplet to homogeneous matter occurs at @xmath54 @xmath87 0.062 @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that the model with a smaller @xmath2 results in a more complex phase structure and a larger density range of pasta phases for neutron star crusts .",
    "in addition , some properties of the inner crust such as the proton fraction , chemical potentials , and density profiles have also been found to be correlated to the symmetry energy slope @xmath2 , which could be partly explained by the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "we have compared the results of the present tf calculation with those obtained using the cp method .",
    "it has been found that , although there are quantitative differences between these two methods , the qualitative behaviors of the inner crust are very similar to each other , and they are consistent with those reported in earlier studies  @xcite .    the correlation between the symmetry energy slope @xmath2 and the crust - core transition has been examined in the tf approximation using the two sets of models generated from the tm1 and iufsu parametrizations .",
    "it has been found that the crust - core transition density @xmath88 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this correlation is consistent with those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . also , the proton fraction at the transition point @xmath89 decreases significantly with increasing @xmath2 , whereas the transition pressure @xmath90 shows a nontrivial dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "these correlations obtained from the present tf calculation are consistent with those obtained using the cp method  @xcite . in the tf approximation , nuclear shell and pairing effects",
    "have been neglected .",
    "it is of interest to further consider neutron paring and superfluidity in the inner crust of neutron stars .",
