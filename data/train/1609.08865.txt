    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) model of point - like bosons with arbitrary repulsive contact interactions was introduced more than half a century ago by lieb and liniger @xcite as a generalization to finite interaction strengths of the tonks - girardeau gas ( tg ) @xcite of hard - core repulsive bosons , and is known as the lieb - liniger ( ll ) model . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", its exact ground state is given by a set of equations obtained in @xcite and @xcite by coordinate bethe ansatz ( ba ) , a powerful technique introduced by bethe to exactly solve the heisenberg model @xcite . back in the 1960 s ,",
    "experimental realizations of 1d degenerate gases were not available , so the ll model was deemed as a toy model . yet , it soon attracted attention in the context of quantum integrable models @xcite , being one of the simplest . in this respect",
    ", it helped understand various aspects of the many - body problem and why one - dimensional systems are so specific , the most appealing features being the effective fermionization of bosons at large interaction strength @xcite and the existence of two branches of excitations @xcite , one of them reminiscent of the well - known bogoliubov dispersion @xcite , the other linked with a quantum analog of classical solitons @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it has served as a testbed for the universal description of low - energy properties of gapless 1d systems within the bosonization technique , known as the tomonaga - luttinger liquid framework @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium grand canonical description of the ll model was provided by yang and yang who introduced the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) @xcite , opening new investigation directions such as finite - temperature thermodynamics @xcite and quantum statistics of the model @xcite .",
    "the dynamical correlations of the ll model remained for a long time an open problem .",
    "the determination of its exact time - dependent density - density and phase - phase correlations and their fourier transforms known as the dynamical structure factor and spectral function respectively , required the development of fairly involved algebraic bethe ansatz ( aba ) techniques relying on the inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "the form factors were computed numerically using the abacus algorithm @xcite , first at zero @xcite , then at finite temperature @xcite , while parallel works focus on analytic and algebraic general considerations @xcite .",
    "all of them contribute to validate a nonlinear extension of the luttinger liquid theory developed approximately at the same time @xcite .",
    "very recently , new research lines are , among others , out of equilibrium dynamics with quantum quenches @xcite , few - body physics @xcite , and links with other models , such as attractive 1d fermions @xcite , a bcs model @xcite , the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) model @xcite , directed polymers @xcite , three - dimensional black holes @xcite or the yang - mills problem on a 2-sphere @xcite , using mapping techniques , along with extended versions of the model to anyonic statistics @xcite , spatial exponential decay of the interaction @xcite and a supersymmetric version @xcite .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the main reason of the renewed interest for the ll model in the early years of our century is experimental progress in cooling and trapping ultracold atoms .",
    "strong confinement in two transverse dimensions @xcite and low enough temperatures led to realizations of ( quasi-)1d systems of bosons @xcite , some of them suitably described by the ll model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interaction strength is now tunable in a very controlled way @xcite , allowing to probe any interaction regime from weak to strong @xcite , as well as attractive ones @xcite , yielding a strongly excited state called super - tonks - girardeau gas @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of the properties of the ll model are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the momentum distribution has been measured @xcite , as well as local two - body @xcite , three - body @xcite and temporal correlations @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram at finite temperature predicted in @xcite has been explored in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the theoretical and mathematical issues associated with the analytical description of the ground state .",
    "after so many years since the solution by lieb and liniger , the closed - form exact solution of the model is still lacking .",
    "more problematically , a wide range of experimentally relevant , intermediate repulsive interactions , is hardly accessed analytically by perturbation theory .",
    "this lack of accuracy affects the estimate of many physical quantities , such as the sound velocity or the tan s contact of the gas .",
    "moreover , approximation schemes and numerical solutions need benchmarks .",
    "a complete analytical understanding of the ground state , whose importance could be compared to the solution of the 2d ising model , would be a benchmark towards solutions at finite temperature or generalizations to multicomponent systems , where the explicit results from integrability are even less accurate to date . from an analytical point of view , many properties of the ll model are easily studied in the tg limit of infinite interactions . at small enough interaction strengths ,",
    "bogoliubov expansion yields quite accurate results @xcite , and at arbitrary interactions the framework of tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory is appropriate to tackle many low - energy properties @xcite , but the validity range of both approximations is not known with accuracy .    the goal of this article is to provide analytical estimates for the ground state energy , excitation spectrum and other related observables in the experimentally relevant regime of interaction strengths @xmath0 $ ] as defined in eq .",
    "( [ liebparam ] ) below . for this purpose",
    ", we will start from the strongly - interacting regime .",
    "we use a systematic method to obtain corrections from the tg limit and study its accuracy by computing several observables and comparing the results with the numerics and approximations available in the literature .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : first , we introduce the main features of the model and briefly discuss the weakly - interacting regime .",
    "then , focusing on the energy , we systematically evaluate corrections to the regime of infinite interactions up to order @xmath1 and make conjectures about a possible resummation , using comparison with the numerics as an accuracy test .",
    "we compute various ground - state properties linked to this quantity and give results whose accuracy is unprecedented and already sufficient for all practical purposes .",
    "to finish with , we focus on the excitation spectra of the ll model and derive a simple expression which is very accurate in the whole range of repulsive interactions .",
    "the 1d quantum gas of @xmath2 identical spinless point - like bosons of mass @xmath3 with contact interactions confined to a line of length @xmath4 is described by the lieb - liniger hamiltonian @xmath5 which reads in first - quantized form @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 label the positions of the bosons , @xmath8 is the planck constant divided by @xmath9 , @xmath10 is an effective one - dimensional coupling constant which can be deduced from experimental parameters @xcite and @xmath11 is the dirac function . in the following",
    "we will focus on @xmath12 , corresponding to repulsive interactions .",
    "put into its second - quantized form , better suited to treat the thermodynamic limit , the hamiltonian now reads @xcite @xmath13=\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\int_0^l dx \\frac{\\partial\\psi^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}+\\frac{g_{1d}}{2}\\int_0^l dx \\psi^{\\dagger}\\psi^{\\dagger}\\psi\\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a bosonic field satisfying the canonical commutation relations with its hermitian conjugate @xmath15=\\delta(x\\!-\\!x')$ ] , and @xmath16=[\\psi^{\\dagger}(x),\\psi^{\\dagger}(x')]=0 $ ] .",
    "it is natural , then , to define a dimensionless interaction strength ( also known as lieb s parameter ) as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mean linear density of the gas .",
    "the interaction strength for a given atomic species is experimentally tunable by confinement - induced resonance , feshbach resonance or dilution .",

    "an exact solution is available , based on a mapping on a noninteracting spinless fermi gas , allowing for a simple determination of certain observables @xcite .    with periodic boundary conditions corresponding to a ring geometry and ensuring translational invariance , the bethe hypothesis allows to derive exact expressions for the ground state energy , excitations and static correlations of the system .",
    "the procedure , called coordinate bethe ansatz , is well - known for this system and widely explained in the literature , we refer to @xcite for details and elegant physical discussions . at finite @xmath2",
    "this yields a system of @xmath2 transcendental equations , which reduces to a much simpler set in the thermodynamic limit , and becomes analytic .",

    "we mention in passing that it is also known in an other context as love s equation @xcite , whose solution would yield the exact capacitance of a capacitor formed of two circular parallel plates , @xmath32 where @xmath26 has then the physical meaning of an aspect ratio . in itself",
    ", it constitutes an extremely difficult open problem in engineering dating back to clausius and kirchhoff @xcite . for a historical review of many attempts ( - and failures ) to solve this problem , we refer to @xcite .",
    "mathematicians were also inspired by this problem , in the context of convex analysis . among their most important contributions to the problem are an inequality on @xmath33 @xcite and a conjecture that its small @xmath26 expansion should have a deep link with invariants of a riemannian manifold @xcite .    to solve the system composed of eqs .",

    "since we aim at describing correctly the experimentally relevant regime of intermediate interactions , a complementary approach consists in focusing on the strongly - interacting case , then decreasing interactions as much as we can to reach this regime and cross - check the results found at low interactions .",
    "this approach is in principle easier to handle , both analytically or numerically , because one starts far from the singularity at @xmath41 , but on the other hand it requires higher - order expansions .    when interactions are strong , a good way to obtain accurate analytical solutions to the lieb equation eq .",

    "( [ dev ] ) one immediately sees that the maximum exponent of @xmath73 varies more slowly with @xmath69 than the one of @xmath66 , which is the main drawback of the method . indeed , as we will see later on , in order to obtain accurate predictions",

    "we remark that , as a rule of thumb , the absolute value of the local error defined in eq .",

    "<S> we study the ground - state properties and excitation spectrum of the lieb - liniger model of one - dimensional bosons with repulsive contact interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the bethe - ansatz equations in the thermodynamic limit by using an analytic method based on a series expansion on orthogonal polynomials developed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we push the expansion to an unprecedented accuracy and show that the analytical results thereby obtained compete with high - precision numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we thus improve many known results on the density of quasi - momenta , the ground - state energy , the local two - body correlation function of the model , tan s contact and the two branches of the excitation spectrum . by a careful analysis of the mathematical structure of the series expansion , </S>",
    "<S> we make conjectures for a closed - form analytic solution of the model at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we give simple expressions for the ground - state energy and the type ii spectrum , which are valid to a good accuracy in the whole range of repulsive interactions . </S>"
