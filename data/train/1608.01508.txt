    "understanding the structure of low - lying scalar mesons has been one of the most challenging issues in hadronic physics .",
    "their internal structure is still under debate .",
    "recent studies suggest that these scalar mesons may belong to the flavor su(3 ) non-@xmath9 nonet  ( see reviews  @xcite , a `` _ _ note on scalar mesons below 2 gev _ _ '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "there are two scalar - isoscalar mesons ( @xmath10 ) below 1 gev , that is , the lowest - lying @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) and the first excited @xmath0 .",
    "both the @xmath3 and the @xmath0 exist in @xmath11 scattering and their pole positions were investigated based on many different processes , for example , such as @xmath12 reactions  @xcite , @xmath13 decay  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite , @xmath15  @xcite , @xmath16  @xcite , @xmath17  @xcite , @xmath18 scattering  @xcite , and so on ( for details , we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite ) . while the mass and the width of the @xmath0 are more or less known to be @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev , those of @xmath3 are still far from consensus ( see ref .",
    "the upper bound of the @xmath3 mass is given in the large @xmath21 limit in terms of the gasser - leutwyler low - energy constant  @xcite , which suggests that the @xmath22 mass is quite possibly smaller than 700 mev .",
    "recently , the clas collaboration has reported the first analysis of the @xmath23-wave photoproduction of @xmath24 pairs in the region of the @xmath0 at photon energies between 3.0 and 3.8 gev and momentum transfer squared @xmath25 between @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite . while the differential cross section for the @xmath28 process in the @xmath23-wave shows an evident signal for the @xmath0 production , the @xmath3 was not seen clearly .",
    "however , there is still a hint for the existence of the @xmath3 in @xmath29 photoproduction measured at different kinematic conditions  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to study the @xmath30 reaction in the scalar and isoscalar channel .",
    "since these two pions are strongly correlated , one has to consider the rescattering effects of these two pions to describe @xmath30 in the scalar and isoscalar channel , which are essential in order to explain the production mechanism of the scalar and isoscalar mesons @xmath22 quantitatively in @xmath29 photoproduction .",
    "moreover , it is crucial to take into account the @xmath31 channel in addition  @xcite , since its threshold is open in the vicinity of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "before we carry out the investigation on the @xmath32 reaction , we first want to examine the related two - body process @xmath33 .",
    "since the clas collaboration already presented the differential cross section for @xmath0 photoproduction in the photon energy range @xmath34 gev , it is important to study @xmath22 photoproduction theoretically as well before we examine the @xmath30 process with pion pairs in the @xmath23-wave .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 photoproduction , we study in the present work the @xmath3 production by photon beams , based on effective lagrangians and a regge approach .",

    "@xcite with the same regge trajectory but a different set of parameters .",
    "we will first compute the differential cross section for @xmath0 photoproduction and compare the results with the clas experimental data such that we can fix parameters for the @xmath2- and @xmath35-channel reggeons . since there is no excited nucleon that decays into @xmath24 pairs in the @xmath23-wave and @xmath36 beyond the @xmath37 threshold ,",
    "we consider only the @xmath36 exchange in the @xmath6 channel",
    ". then we will proceed to study @xmath3 photoproduction with the same parameters for the reggeons , which is fixed in @xmath0 production .",
    "as far as @xmath3 photoproduction is concerned , we need to consider several excited nucleons above the threshold energy , which can decay into @xmath38 , where the pion pairs are in the isoscalar and scalar wave .    upon computing the transition amplitude for the @xmath3 photoproduction , there are ambiguities to which we have to pay attention carefully .",
    "firstly , the width of the @xmath3 is very large , so that the value of the @xmath3 mass is quite uncertain .",
    "thus , we have to look into the dependence of the results on the @xmath3 mass .",
    "secondly , the photocoupling constant @xmath39 is not much known .",
    "though there are several theoretical suggestions on its value , the agreement has not been reached yet .",
    "experimentally , two relevant decay channels are known : @xmath40  @xcite and @xmath41  @xcite . to see the contribution of the @xmath3 in these decay processes , one has to reply on models .",
    "so , it is required to examine uncertainties arising from the coupling constant @xmath42 .",
    "finally , the final state in the @xmath43 decay should contain both the background @xmath11 and the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "it indicates that it is rather difficult to determine the coupling constants for the @xmath44 unambiguously .",
    "considering these points that will cause the uncertainties of the present work , we have to introduce certain assumptions before we proceed to investigate @xmath3 photoproduction .",
    "though we will take 500 mev as a main value for the @xmath3 mass in this work , we will carefully examine the dependence of the results for the total cross section on the mass of the lowest - lying scalar meson .",
    "finally , we will regard @xmath24 pairs in the @xmath23-wave as the @xmath3 meson , which are produced in the course of the @xmath45 decays , so that we are able to determine the strong coupling constants for the @xmath46 transitions .",
    "considering the fact that the @xmath3 resonance is the most dominant one in @xmath11 scattering in the scalar - isoscalar channel , this approximation is a reasonable one .",
    "in addition to the roper resonance , we want to consider other @xmath5 resonances that can decay into @xmath47 . referring to ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that 10 excited nucleon resonances have the decay channel of @xmath48 . however , there are not enough data for @xmath49 except for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath52 has an overall status 2 star , we will not consider it ( see the review `` _ _ @xmath36 and @xmath53 resonances _ _ '' in ref .",
    "thus , we expect that the main contribution will come from @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "as will see later , @xmath51 provides predominantly a large contribution to the total cross section .",

    "this arises from the @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath1-reggeon propagator in eq.([eq : reggepropagator ] ) .",
    "model ii yields rather different results from those based on model i. since the @xmath59 resonance is the most dominant one from the threshold energy through 1.5 gev as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , and it has spin @xmath108 with positive parity , we expect that it will have a certain effect on the @xmath153 dependence of the differential cross section .",
    "indeed , it steers @xmath152 up to @xmath155 gev , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] . as @xmath66 increases more than 1.5 gev , the @xmath1 and @xmath36 reggeons gain control of the @xmath153 dependence of the differential cross section , so that we have more or less the same results as in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] draws the results of the differential cross section @xmath112 as a function of @xmath2 in the range of @xmath156 gev , so that we can directly compare them with those of @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence is almost the same as that of the @xmath0 case , because we have exactly the same @xmath1- and @xmath36-reggeon exchanges .",
    "the only differences come from the coupling constants .",
    "the contributions of the @xmath5 resonances are all suppressed in this region of the photon energies .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath112 is approximately 10 times larger than that of @xmath0 photoproduction on account of different coupling constants .",
    "note that the differential cross section @xmath112 obeys the following asymptotic behavior @xmath157 and the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] satisfies eq.([eq : asymptot2 ] ) .",
    "we aimed in this work at investigating @xmath3 and @xmath0 photoproduction , based on a hybridized regge model .",
    "we first described the differential cross section @xmath112 for the @xmath65 reaction , compared with the recent experimental data on it .",
    "we fixed the relevant regge parameters by reproducing the data .",
    "we introduced the @xmath5 contribution in the @xmath6 channel to study the production mechanism of the @xmath158 reaction . since its threshold energy is much smaller than @xmath0 photoproduction ,",
    "there exist several @xmath5 resonances that can decay into @xmath47 . assuming that @xmath3 is much stronger than the background of the @xmath159 channel",
    ", we were able to find the strong coupling constants for the @xmath160 vertices .",
    "the photocouplings of the @xmath5 resonances were determined by using the experimental data on the corresponding photon decay amplitudes .",
    "the cut - off masses for the form factors were fixed to be 0.8 gev to avoid additional ambiguity . in dealing with these @xmath5 resonances , we constructed model i and model ii . model i included those with spin 1/2 only , while model ii was built in such a way that more @xmath5 resonances with higher spins were added to model i. near threshold , we found that the @xmath161 was the most dominant one in model i , whereas the effects of @xmath5 resonances with negative parity were almost negligible . in model ii ,",
    "the contribution of the @xmath59 dictates the total cross section of the @xmath122 reaction .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath59 resonance enhances the magnitude of the total cross section up to about @xmath162 .",
    "the main reason comes from the large value of its photoncouplings .",
    "the strong coupling constant of the @xmath59 is also relatively large .",
    "since the mass of the @xmath3 meson is not precisely fixed because of its large width , we examined the dependence of the total cross section on its mass in the range of @xmath163 mev .",
    "as expected , small the @xmath3 mass was , the larger the total cross section was in model i. however , as @xmath164 increases , the total cross section is amplified in model ii .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coupling constant of @xmath59 becomes larger as @xmath139 increases .",
    "if @xmath66 increases , then the @xmath5 contribution fade away very fast , so that @xmath1 and @xmath36 exchanges takes over the control as in the case of @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "we also computed the differential cross section @xmath165 .",
    "while the contributions of the @xmath5 resonances in the @xmath6 channel are rather flat in the case of model i , @xmath59 governs @xmath153 dependence again because of its high spin .",
    "interestingly , the differential cross section is much more enhanced in the backward direction , while at the very forward angle it almost vanishes .",
    "this tendency becomes clearer as @xmath66 increases .",
    "finally , we computed the differential cross section @xmath112 for the @xmath102 reactoin .",
    "the results showed that the @xmath2 dependence looked very similar to those for @xmath0 photoproduction . on the other hand ,",
    "its magnitude is about ten times larger than that of the @xmath0 case .",
    "though it is very difficult to study @xmath3 photoproduction experimentally , it is still of great importance to study the production mechanism of the @xmath122 reaction , since it cast light on the structure of the @xmath5 resonances as investigated in the present work",
    ". it also provides a certain clue in studying more complicated processes with three - particle final states such as @xmath166 in the future .",
