    "vortices play an important role in several two - dimensional condensed matter systems at low temperatures such as superfluids and superconductors , fractional quantized hall systems @xcite and josephson junction arrays @xcite .",
    "they are also believed to play an important role in the quantum phase transitions these systems undergo @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional vortices can ideally be represented as pointlike and are , close to the absolute zero of temperature , governed by the laws of quantum physics .",
    "the quantum mechanics of such pointlike vortices , which is known since long ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is unusual .",
    "this is because classically , instead of obeying newton s equations of motion , the coordinates of a vortex center obey kirchoff s equations of motion @xcite . as will be recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : qm ] , this is connected to a peculiar canonical structure known to arise also in the problem of a charged particle confined to move in a plane subject to an external magnetic field @xcite . as a result",
    ", the classical dynamics of a vortex in a two - dimensional fluid resembles that of a charged particle in a plane under the influence of a magnetic field @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", various quantum - mechanical formulations of vortex dynamics in superfluid films have been put forward which use this analogy @xcite . in these so - called dual approaches ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : qm ] ) , vortices are still described by delta functions representing their worldlines , but their interaction is now pictured as being mediated by a photon  the quantum of the electromagnetic field  and not , as in the original formulation , by a phonon  the quantum of the goldstone field associated with the spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry of a superfluid .",
    "the analogy can be understood @xcite by comparing the continuity equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle number density and @xmath2 the particle number current of the superfluid , to the maxwell equation ( gaussian units will be used throughout ) : @xmath3 it is to be noted that in 2 + 1 dimensions , the magnetic field @xmath4 is a scalar , and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) the antisymmetric levi - civita symbol ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "it follows that with the replacements @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the magnetic flux quantum , the continuity equation goes over into the maxwell equation . the fundamental constants are included in ( [ corresp ] ) to match the dimensions on both sides of the replacements . since the integral @xmath11 represents the magnetic flux penetrating the surface @xmath12 , the ratio @xmath13 is the flux number density @xmath14 . in other words ,",
    "the duality transformation maps the particles of the original formulation onto flux quanta in the dual formulation .    in this paper , we take an entirely different approach . instead of considering a quantum - mechanical , i.e. , `` first - quantized '' description of vortices in a superfluid film at the absolute zero of temperature , we study a quantum - field - theoretic , i.e. , `` second - quantized '' description recently put forward by these authors @xcite .",
    "vortices are here not described by delta functions representing their worldlines as in the quantum - mechanical approach , but by a nonsingular quantum field .",
    "the quantum field theory fulfills two stringent constraints .",
    "the first one arises because at zero temperature the entire system is superfluid , and can , therefore , be considered an ideal fluid . according to a theorem due to helmholtz @xcite , a vortex in an ideal fluid moves with the fluid , and , hence , has no independent dynamics .",
    "the second constraint stems from the following observation .",
    "an electron traversing a closed path in a magnetic field accumulates an aharonov - bohm phase given by ( @xmath15 times ) the number of flux quanta encircled @xcite .",
    "the above analogy then asserts that an elementary vortex traversing a closed path in a superfluid film also accumulates a geometrical phase given by ( @xmath15 times ) the number of particles encircled @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : qft ] ) that both these constraints are satisfied by a specific chern - simons theory .",
    "two of the main characteristics of a chern - simons theory in general are that , first , it contains a vector field which has no independent dynamics , and that , second , it imparts flux to particles . by representing vortices by a chern - simons field",
    ", we assured that they have no independent dynamics , and that they see the particles as sources of geometrical phase . to connect with the standard quantum - mechanical approach , we introduce in sec .",
    "[ sec : qft ] external vortices in the field theory and show that , in this way , the known results are reproduced .",
    "the specific chern - simons theory proposed in @xcite is based on the effective theory of phonons describing a superfluid film at low energies and small momenta ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : eff ] ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian is the most general one consistent with the symmetries of the problem , in particular galilei invariance and invariance under global u(1 ) transformations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scat ] , we use this effective theory extended by the chern - simons part , representing the vortices , to investigate one - loop contributions to the elastic scattering of phonons by a vortex .",
    "we apply dimensional analysis to identify the relevant feynman graphs . to the order in which we are working , we do not encounter ultraviolet divergences in the effective theory ; only a logarithmic infrared divergence arises .",
    "this introduces an arbitrary scale factor into the problem .",
    "often such a factor appears instead when eliminating ultraviolet divergences by a redefinition of certain parameters of the effective theory .",
    "the one - loop contributions evaluated in this paper give the first correction to an old result for the scattering of a sound wave from a vortex obtained by pitaevskii in the born approximation @xcite .",

    "this global symmetry is spontaneously broken by a nontrivial ground state .",

    "we have also omitted a term of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath2 is the noether current associated with the global u(1 ) symmetry , @xmath53 this term , which after a partial integration becomes @xmath54 , is also irrelevant at low energy and small momentum because in a first approximation the particle number density is constant , so that the classical current satisfies the condition @xmath55 the spectrum @xmath56 obtained from the matrix @xmath57 with the background field @xmath49 set to zero is the famous single - particle bogoliubov spectrum @xcite , @xmath58 the most notable feature of this spectrum is that it is gapless , behaving for small momentum as @xmath59 with @xmath60 a velocity which is sometimes referred to as the microscopic sound velocity . it was first shown by beliaev @xcite that ( in three dimensions ) the gaplessness of the single - particle spectrum persists at the one - loop order .",
    "this was subsequently proven to hold to all orders in perturbation theory by hugenholtz and pines @xcite .",
    "for large momentum , the bogoliubov spectrum takes a form @xmath61 typical for a nonrelativistic particle with mass @xmath31 moving in a medium . to highlight the condensate , we have chosen here the second equality in ( [ eff : bogo ] ) , where @xmath33 is replaced with @xmath62 .",
    "the gaplessness of the single - particle spectrum ( [ eff : bogo ] ) is a result of goldstone s theorem .",
    "this can , for example , be seen by considering the relativistic version of the theory . there , one finds two spectra : one corresponding to a massive higgs particle which in the nonrelativistic limit becomes extremely heavy and decouples from the theory , and one corresponding to the goldstone mode of the spontaneously broken global u(1 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "the latter reduces in the nonrelativistic limit to the bogoliubov spectrum . another way to see",
    "this is to couple the theory ( [ eff : lagr ] ) to an electromagnetic field .",
    "the single - particle spectrum then acquires an energy gap .",
    "this is what one expects to happen to the spectrum of a goldstone mode when the higgs mechanism is operating . in other words , the single - particle spectrum ( [ eff : bogo ] )",
    "is identical to that of the goldstone mode which physically represents the collective density fluctuations in the superfluid .",
    "the equivalence of the single - particle excitation and the collective density fluctuation has been proven to all orders in perturbation by gavoret and nozires @xcite .    to find the effective theory governing the superfluid at low energy and small momentum from ( [ eff : l0 ] ) , we integrate out the fluctuating field @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "we discuss a quantum field theory of vortices recently proposed by these authors @xcite and show that it reproduces the results discussed here .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that vortices in a two - dimensional superfluid at the absolute zero of temperature can be considered as point particles which are subject to the laws of quantum physics .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether vortices also admit a quantum - field - theoretic , or `` second - quantized '' description . in a recent letter ,",
    "we have argued they indeed do and proposed the following quantum field theory @xcite : @xmath240 it consists of the nonrelativistic effective lagrangian ( [ eff : leff ] ) describing the superfluid without vortices , _ linearly _ coupled via the particle number current @xmath241 to a vector field @xmath242 describing the vortices .",

    "this would disagree with the physics we wish to describe , namely the dynamics of vortices in a _",
    "compressible _ superfluid film . for the gapless sound mode to survive a coupling to a gauge field , the coupling can not be minimal so that there is no local gauge invariance in the full theory .",
    "the appearance of a chern - simons term in ( [ vbn ] ) is expected for two reasons .",
    "first , as we discussed in the previous section , vortices in a superfluid at the absolute zero of temperature always move with the fluid .",
    "in other words , they have no independent dynamics .",
    "this is precisely also a basic property of a chern - simons term .",
    "it comes about because the zeroth component @xmath248 of the vector field is a lagrange multiplier , demanding the equality @xmath249 or when integrated @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the particle number and @xmath252 the `` magnetic '' flux associated with the chern - simons field . in the coulomb gauge @xmath253 , eq.([para ] ) can be easily solved to yield @xmath254 where the green function @xmath157 is given in ( [ green ] ) .",
    "the solution shows that the chern - simons field is entirely determined by the particle number density @xmath1 and that it has , therefore , no independent dynamics .",
    "the second reason why a chern - simons term is expected to appear is that it encodes the geometrical phase acquired by a vortex when it winds around a boson .",
    "the quantum - mechanical analog of such a term , representing the linking number @xcite of a closed boson and vortex trajectory , was introduced in the problem by arovas and freire @xcite . to calculate the geometrical phase @xmath255 we again evaluate the wilson loop @xmath256 $ ] obtained by integrating the chern - simons field @xmath257 around a closed path @xmath67 in the superfluid , @xmath258,\\ ] ] where we substituted the explicit form ( [ aa ] ) for @xmath257 .",
    "this geometrical phase is precisely the one in ( [ berry ] ) obtained by haldane and wu @xcite .",

    "this is because @xmath269 can be written as a gradient of a scalar function [ see ( [ grada ] ) ] .",
    "when substituting the solution ( [ feq ] ) back into the lagrangian ( [ rel ] ) , which is tantamount to integrating out the field @xmath89 , we recover precisely the action ( [ qm : action ] ) .",
    "we thus see that the theory ( [ rel ] ) with its linear coupling to a chern - simons field correctly reproduces the two - dimensional action of point vortices in an incompressible superfluid .",
    "let us continue by considering the lowest order elastic scattering amplitude of two phonons calculated from the effective theory . in the frame where the sum of the momenta of the two incoming phonons is zero , the class of diagrams involving the exchange of chern - simons quanta represents the scattering of a phonon from a vortex .",
